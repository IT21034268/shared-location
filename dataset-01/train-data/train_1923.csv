1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i have had this book since it first came out and i havent finished it yet!!go to your local bookstore,find this book,if its still out there.read jimmys letter to the author.close the book and go home knowing you have read the best part!!true parrotheads will find A PIRATE LOOKS AT 50 the true JIMMY BUFFETT bio."
2,"A tremendous opportunity, badly fumbled.","As a serious (if that descriptor could possibly apply) Parrothead, I jumped at this title. Wow! More good stuff about a good guy. Wow! What a disappointment.What's truly ironic is that the author is a gold-card member of the Nashville establishment, the music community that Buffett rejected shortly after it rejected him. Which was for the better, I'd add. The author has done deep research, and reported every word of it. He rambles into mostly irrelevant and fairly menaingless anecdotes that do nothing to help us understand the inner Jimmy.This is a demanding book. You almost need a notepad to keep track of the awkward leaps forward and back through history, along with unpredictable changes in narrator, tense and setting. This is not a four-Margarita-in-the-hammock read.I enjoyed some of it, but I understand why Jimmy refused to cooperate. I'll wait for the autobiography he's promised in 36 years."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is one of the most poorly-researched and writtenbiographies I have ever read. As a longtime Parrothead and journalist,I find this book particularly offensive. It is clear from the outset that the author did not have the cooperation of Buffett, which would have been fine had he compensated by putting some extra effort into his research. Instead, you are deluged with trivial anecdotes and insignificant quotes from marginal figures in Jimmy's life. Most Buffett fans will already know most of the pertinent information in this book, so it is just not worth the time and supreme effort it takes to read it."
1,Tossed them all out.,I ordered these for my stylus. They not only fit my stylus but I broke the stylus trying to get them on.
3,monopod,"When i ordered the monopod i read some reviews first and most said that the monopod was very well constructed.I also read a review that said u needed to buy a mount for the top so that u could mount a (camera,video etc...)which i thought was wrong as i have a smaller monopod that has an interchangeable screw on the top for different size cameras etc...After receiving the monopod the reviewer was correct u do need to buy a top to mount a camera if u have a standard screw on ur camera.I like the monopod but wish the manufacturer would have let us know the screw size in the product info"
1,Didn't fit.,"When I got this monopod I was shocked of how heavy and big it is. Moreover, it didn't function by itself. You got to buy another piece, which will cost double, to use it with your camera!I was disappointed."
2,Strictly for rank amateurs,Remarkably thin on content. Entire domains such as ActiveLists are ignored. Obvious needs such as a complete lexicon of icons are ignored. They're right about one thing--trying to get this information out of the ICQ Web site is very difficult. That's why I bought the book. But trying to find information in this book is just as futile.
3,ICQ for Dummies?,"I would think that a person who can't figure out by his- or herself how to use the chat program ICQ would probably have a hard time reading this book or any other. Sad anthology to the times we live in, I suppose."
5,"If you have an army to feed, this is the one","This pot is HUGE. You could probobly cook 6-8 lobsters or have an awsome clam bake with it. It's beautiful, heavy and unbelievably priced."
2,All Clad's lower quality set of stock pots,"Don't be fooled, this pot is not up to the usual standards of All-clad's pots. It appears that to cut the cost, they only made the bottom thick with that triple layer of metal. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but the bonding of the bottom to the sides leaves a lip where food can catch and get burnt into the pan. (difficult to clean)If you need a big pot, keep looking."
2,Wonderful technique - bad instrument - bad sound,"Mr. Koster's mastery of the instrument is wonderful. However, he sounds as though he's playing his flamenco music on a classical guitar - not an instrument made for playing flamenco music. The result is much like playing Scarlatti keyboard sonatas with the pedal to the metal."
2,Pentel Rolling Writer: Love/Hate,"While this is my preferred implement (balance, flow, - even colours -) I've found my last several orders were not up to snuff. They ran dry very quickly, the points jammed up - a real disapointment. Perhaps Pentel changed manufacture site/process? I'm switching to Pilot's V-Ball for now."
5,Great product!,"I applied 303 with a paint brush,let it dry over night and waited for the rain.I did this about a month ago,and every time it rains,the top beads up like it's been waxed!"
3,Nice Product...POOR applicator,"Just finished applying the fabric guard to my soft top. I have read great reviews and expect good performance from 303. However the spray bottle provided with the product was very POOR quality. It provided some spray but a lot of spatter and big droplets. Was really poor. In addition, it ran all over my hand as I was spraying and dripped all over my car. If I were to use the product again, I would transfer the fabric guard to a quality spray bottle before using. I hope your application experience is better."
1,Not great for a Mini Cooper Convertible.,"I cleaned the top as directed. Let it dry. Used this product as directed placing a few light coatings on. Then, it repelled water until the car was washed. This product seemed to be washed away with regular car wash soap purchased from the local auto parts store. I did not go through a car wash. I will be trying another product now for our Mini's convertible top."
2,303 Fabric Convertable Top Kit,"Cleaner works very well. Top treatment........not as well as I hoped. Water beads off only with light rain, if it rains all day, or HARD - it really doesn't seem to be any better than when it was untreated. I will try a different brand next time."
4,"Cleaner was ok, but the protection spray was awesome.","Like the title says the cleaner I wasn't that thrilled with, I think in the future I will just save some money and use a sponge and soup.However the protection spray was excellent. After spraying my top down and letting it dry you could really see the difference. The top went from a little faded black to a dark black very close to factory. I have a 2007 Mustang GT with 50k miles just to give you an idea.I had some white spots on my top from I guess wear, and the protection spray got rid of them. Also following the instructions after the spray dried I poured a cup of water on the car - and it all beaded up like it should.The only issue is I sprayed it down following the directions and not really over spraying, and I used about half the bottle. So definitely plan on stocking up! Its worth the expense."
2,"Applied properly, Water Beading not Consistent","Bought this because I wanted to get my car ""winter"" ready meaning the rag top has to be water repellent.I applied this as a last step in the car washing process. After rinsing and deep cleaning the top with the rag top cleaner, I waited until the top got a little dry per the instructions. I then liberally applied the sealer product to the top and waited for the product to get soaked in and set. I then applied another layer of sealer to add further protection and added double the needed amount along the seams.Once it was done, the top glistened with the product and I was sure it would repel 100% of water. Not so much when it rained. The water would bead in some areas and not in others, and even the water beading in some areas would then soak in over time. It was not 100% repellent as I had hoped and came no where close to how water beads when you first buy the car."
5,Great product,"This product does a great job. The directions are very easy to follow and application of the cleaner and water-resistant solutions to the fabric top was easy due to the spray bottles. The results are fantastic. Before I applied this product water didn't beed up at all on my convertible top, and on very rainy days it leaked. After application any moisture immediately beeds up and rolls of the top. This is even afer it rained a few hours after treatment. No more leaks! You do have to cover your windows with newspaper but this is not hard to do. I will continue to use this product and highly recommend to anyone with a fabric top convertible."
4,303 Convertible top kit,"LOVED the water repellent treatement - water beads up like on fresh wax. Cleaner was fine but not clear that it worked any better than just a regular wash. I treated a small cay (Sky) and almost used the whole bottle of treatement. I'm not sure one bottle would treat an entire roof for a larger car. To be fair though, I did apply it fairly liberally."
4,It works.,"The product works as advertised, however I need almost the entire bottle of the protector to do the top of my two seater roadster, while only about a quarter of the cleaner. So when you buy, buy the kit, and then get a few extra bottles of the protector separately."
4,Great Cookwear,"I bought this set as a gift for my self, it was quailty for a price in my budget. I have a problem with the skillets. things stick and burn. I use low heat but they are not for cooking eggs. The lid handles get very hot. They clean up very nice after soaking. I wish they would have a small sauce pan. Over all I do like the set."
4,"Economical, and functional.... but not All Clad","As they say, you get what you pay for.... I'm really pleased with the set... Maybe more so because I didn't pay All Clad prices... It is built very solid with a heavy thick bottom... It's stainless, so despite my best efforts I have not been able to destroy them... I am hard on my gear, and this is no exception... The only down side is that the walls are not as thick as All Clad or even the Calphalon stainless sets.. so if you use high flame, and swirl the contents you hear the sizzle as it touches the VERY hot sides of the pot... But, other than that, they look great (could have done without Emerill's signature on the handle though) and they work... The lids are interchangeable for the most part as long as you stick to the same sizes (i.e 3qt sauce pan lid fits 3qt steamer etc..)So all in all, I give it a 4... All Clad is better, but at double the cost it better be...."
4,Very impressed,"I have to say that I am surprised by all of the complaints of everything sticking to these pots and pans. I just got the Emeril set for Christmas, and am really impressed with how things DON'T stick to the pans. I registered for Calphalon 5 years ago for my wedding and was not happy with the set all these years. Just started using my Emeril set and have to say I am really impressed. Scrambled eggs slid right off the pan, unlike my old pans."
4,"Good, but could be better","I bought this set and like very much,, but they need to include a 12"" Fry pan, the 10"" is OK,, but everyone needs a larger pan.. besides that,, I am a person with big hands, and I think the handles could be bigger..but they work very well,, now I just have to add a 12"" for $70. a third of what the set cost me.."
2,emeril pots and pan set,I bought this set as a gift for myself after a divorce and I was so excited to get them and use them. I uses them once and I HATE them! Everything sticks and they are very hard to clean after using. I would suggest looking for other pots and pans and skip these.
1,should not be on the market--,"our pot leaked in the seam between the stainless steel and the copper and spewed boiling water. The company said it ""as has a few do this before but it is vary rare."""
3,Scientific observation - I Don't own the Pots (yet?),"(DISREGARD RATING ABOVE) I was researching All-Clad, Calphalon, etc., and read the review below alleging the ""melted"" Emerilware. Even went to the website and looked at the pics. This guy has GOT to be full of it. For the curious, the melting temperature of Aluminum (Al) is 660C, or 1,220 deg F (in case you forgot, water boils at 212F). Unless he was cooking on a plasma torch, there's NO WAY THE Al IN THE POT MELTED. Only possible guess(giving the LARGE benefit of the doubt) is someone at the factory filled the pot with Tin (SN) instead, which has a melt temp of 231C/449F (which you could 'potentially' hit on a stove) . Unless, of course, he's just cruising for an easy lawsuit.... Thought y'all should know..."
1,"Crap!! Pot Melted, ruined our kitchen floor","These pots are not actually made by All-Clad. They are made out of country and All-Clad puts their name on them. Be very careful with this cookware. While steaming some broccolli, the water boiled out within 1.5 minutes. The pot then started squirting molten aluminum out of the copper band on the pot. This metal burned our floor badly. Luckily no one was hurt. Check out this website for pictures. http://home.earthlink.net/~stevens/id4.htmlSo far All-Clad would not pay to replace our floor. It looks as though we will have to get a lawyer and sue."
1,FANTASTIC,"I love this cookware. We are in the service and my household goods got stuck so I got on Amazon and ordered Emerilware's Stainless 10 pc cookware set. It is well worth the money, clean up is easy I love it, I am so glad I made the choice for this. I suggest you replace your cookware, you will be glad you did."
1,Pan's stick and stain,I just cooked in my new pans and everything I cook in the pan sticks and now the pan is stained. I expected more out of these pans. They are beautiful but not usable.
4,Great Cookware,I had been looking for a set of cookware for over a year. Saw this on one of his shows and just had to have it. All-Chad has a good name. Love the heavy bottom for even cooking. It helps when you are a professional Chef and you know what you want and need. This product fit that bill. Have been using it for over two months now and it is great. Has handeled everything I have thrown at it. Have ordered other pieces and pans to give me a more complete set.
5,Emerilware 10-Piece Stainless Cookware Set,I am thoroughly enjoying using this cookware. I have been replacing my non-stick cookware with stainless and cast iron cookware since the recent news releases about using teflon cookware.
3,Emeril's cookware,"Do you have strong arms? You will need strength to manage this cookware. It is shiny, heavy and looks wonderful, but can be very heavy, esp. if cooking stews and roasts. I found that with a fiery hot pot that needs to be lifted by a strong man or better yet,a forklift, perhaps after a few more trips to the gym I could get my lovely cookware back out again."
4,Emeril pans,Very good quality but very heavy to lift. Do need low heat.I like shopping online with Amazon.com
1,I f I could give this a negative I would...,These pans are horrible. Nothing cooks right and everything sticks to the bottom of the pans - if your boiling it seems okay but that is all. Plus when cleaning you risk the chance of cutting yourself on the pans which I have done many times and I just cut my thumb just a few minutes ago washing the edges clean. These pans are horrible and if I could have given them a negative I would have. Emeril you put your name on these pans - you are nothing but a money hungry sloth. Careful thought should be given when making a purchase. Keep it in the good old USA - BUY USA MADE PRODUCTS!
4,Very nice...,"Recieved these pots and pans from my husband for Christmas. I am very excited to use them. They are beautiful and very solid. Well made. My only complaint is when you first get them they all have a large sticker in the bottom of each that comes off easily with soap and water, however it leaves a residue which you can't feel, but you can see on the bottom of the pans. I'd like to know if anyone else has seen this and what can be done to remove it. I'm afraid to heat them up yet because I don't know if that residue is going to get darker."
5,Had them a year and love them,"I got this set for Christmas last year and still feel like they are brand new. I've used them many times, and they haven't warped at all, the handles are very sturdy and stay cool during cooking. Great construction. I haven't had ANY problems at all. They hold their heat well and you don't have to turn your stove on as high as you would think, and cook very evenly. My kids drop the lids all the time and none have broken. I cook every day and they still look brand new. (I use Barkeeper's Friend to clean tough spots). I can't say enough great things about them. My dad was over for Thanksgiving and really liked them too, and I think he may get himself a set for Christmas now."
4,"Nice Quality, Good Price",My wife and I wanted to upgrade our cooking supplies while still on a tight budget. These units are of good quality and cook food evenly like a good cook wants. The heating surface performs admirably under all cooking circumstances (at least that I have been able to put them through). I certainly recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a $1000 dollars on a set but still wants quality. Bon Appetit!
4,Great deal for the money,"The Emerilware Stainless is great cookware for the price. I really wish people would understand that pots and pans that are NOT non-stick can not be treated as if they were nonstick.First of all, you must preheat the pans and use some type of oil, fat, etc.Second, do not overheat these pans. A little over ""medium"" is about all you need unless you're just boiling water. Anything hotter than that will often cause the metal to look blueish until it is properly cleaned. This is true of all stainless cookware I've used.Also, the copper on the pot will tarnish because, IT IS COPPER. That's going to happen. So if you want the cookware to look nice and pretty then don't use them. If you actually plan to cook, this is some decent cookware at a decent price. (BTW, the copper cleans easily with Bar Keeper's Friend, or a common household solution such as lemon juice and salt).That said, I prefer All-Clad. (I plan on becoming a chef, and I'm insistent on having the best)"
3,Some warnings for those who have used cheap pans,"I received these pans for my wedding and did not read the care instructions before using. DO THIS RIGHT AWAY. I have never cooked with good non-stick pans and did not treat these any differently. My first time cooking with them I used non-stick spray, used high heat and then washed them in the dishwasher. I started to wonder why everything was leaving marks on my pans and I couldn't get them clean. Then I read the care instructions. Now, everything sticks. I feel like I've ruined them, and I have only used them less than 10 times. I may have to check the warranty and see if they have a moron clause in there. Please let me know if you have any tips on how to get them back to the way they should be, or do I need to just suck it up. All in all, they look great and cook very thoroughly and fast, and I'm sure they clean easy if you take good care of them."
4,Love it!,"This cookeware is great! 2 years ago when my husband and I got married, all our cookware was hand me downs, so we had a mix of teflon and older stainless steel! None of which cooked all that great! So this year for my birthday my husband got me this set & I love it! It cooks so evenly and you dont need to use a high heat, I cook everything at about 2 notches lower than I used to! The only complaint I had was the first time we used it to saute onions, I didnt realize that I needed to use a lower heat and it scorched my pan! I scrubbed and scrubbed and it wouldnt come off, so I got some bar keepers friend and it worked wonderfully! :) So that took away my complaint! I would highly recommend it and purchase it again!"
4,Emerilware Cookware,"Beautiful stainless with copper laminate. Conducts heat very well and is easy to control when carmeling or sauting food. My set did have a couple of minor imperfections on the side of the fry pans, but not significant enough to return or really complain about. CAUTION: Lid handles get very hot and a pot holder will be needed to remove them during cooking."
3,Cleaning,After using the cookware the first time I had a hard time keeping it clean and shiny. It doesn't look like the first time that I used it. I feel it doesn't clean up well. If I had known it was an ordeal to keep the pots clean I would not have bought it.
2,Oh My! Quality control.,"After about 6 weeks of infrequent use the glass lid to the shallow pan shattered while cooking lima beans. Heat level was low and nothing unusual until ""Pow"" the lid shattered. After cooling we tried to lift the lid off when the handle fell off and glass fell into the beans. After checking some other review sites (Consumer Reports) we found that this is not an isolated incident. It appears that these pans were manufactured in China and the quality is not what it used to be. Can not recommend this set to anyone unless you just want to display it."
1,DANGER!!! I CUT MY FINGER WASHING A PAN,I just want to warn everyone that these pots and pans have very sharp edges and I just cut my finger on an edge while washing a pan. I want to return the set as I consider them too dangerous to use. I spent about $150 on the set and think it was pretty much a waste of money. My advice is to check the edges of cookware before buying...I just went by the pictures on the box and couldn't tell how sharp the edges were...I'm surprised there isn't a recall....this is a safety issue!
5,Best Wedding Gift Ever!,"Ok...my husband and I got married on the spur. So as a wedding present, my family pitched in and bought us this cookware set. I've not really cooked with any other products, except farberware. And this is soooo much better! I love everything about this set! It's so easy to cook with, clean up, and store! I truly love cooking with this set! My mom purchased the Wolf Gang collection, and it's just not the same! His are so light and uneven when cooking. Emeril's cookware is heavy, and consistant! It feels like I'm cooking in a real kitchen with these! This was definately a dream set, and am so grateful that my family bought these for us! I now want to add to my collection and keep up the great cooking!"
3,customer service,"Well, the stainless steel set works just fine. It has helped me cook better and I can finally do that deglazing thing like a champ! The small saute pan was damaged when I opened it and I should have just wrapped it back up and sent it back to Amazon (not Amazon's fault...it's the company who did the packing). I was desparate for cookware and used all the other pieces. Anyways, I call the customer service number and I was on hold for 30 minutes twice getting nowhere. I finally left a message and never heard anything for a week. I lfet another message and finally someone got back with me. I told them the situation and he said I would have to write a letter explaining my complaint and they would not pay for shipping the product back and he would not promise a replacement. Well, in my opinion that's awful customer service. The set works great but I wish they cared about the customer more."
1,They stink...,Can't even be fitted to a Nikon D200 body. Any lens collar will also likely not be able to fit this. The RC2 system is just not made for serious photo gear.
1,A CD that doesn't exist,Bay Cities considered releasing this album on Cd but discovered that in order to do so they would have to pay the cast. The cast recorded these selections basically as a demo for promotional use. Some cassettes were manufactured and are in circulation. A listen reveals exactly why this show flopped so badly. Aside from the title song there is little to recommend here. The cassette is also drenched in reverb making it almost unlistenable. Bay Cities made the correct decision when they decided not to issue this on CD.
3,I think I'll buy the hard copy!,"I read the Bottle Imp on my daughter's Kindle. There were several annotated footnotes with no footnote to be found, which was rather distracting.This is a wonderful tale of self sacrifice and the fight between good and evil in which the evil is stored in a bottle!A classic story, told very well by RLS from a Native Hawaiian voice. Robert Louis Stevenson spent much time in the Pacific Islands and you can tell he knows them well from this lovely quick read.I plan on purchasing the hard copy because I was disappointed with the Kindle version. Illustrations were missing as were the footnotes that I mentioned above.I rate three star becuase I purchased the Kindle version, otherwise I would have rated 5 stars for Stevenson's work."
1,Spend $20 more and get something decent,"Where do I start in my criticism of this product? Well, I've had messages that were totally garbled by ""digital static."" The capacity on the answering machine is also quite limited. The phone part works sporadically if at all, and I got this as a Christmas gift--so, in less than a year, the thing is now little more than a paperweight with LED lights. I only use the answering machine part now and have to use a traditional corded phone until I get another cordless because of the lack of quality workmanship in this hunk o' junk. Please, don't suffer my same frustration because this is financially a good deal. Spend just a little more--it'll be worth it."
4,Very Nice Phone,"Contrary to other reviewers, I have had very good experience with this phone. First of all, I think it is a very nice looking phone and is not too big (most phones with answering machine combo are big and ugly). The phone is very clear, and the digital answer machine works very well and never cuts off any message."
1,This phone stinks,We have had this phone for under a year and has stopped the phone lines in the house. We had to have a [company] come to our house only to find out that our phone was faulty. After many phone calls to Casio we finally had a new phone shipped to our house to replace the faulty one. Within 6 months the phone went completely dead. We took it to a repair man and he said it was cheeper to buy a new phone because the phone would only die again. So in conclusion this phone is the worst purchase ever
4,nice,i gave the VT mousepad to my wife and the UVA mousepad kept for myself. nice pieces! good quality print. VERY thin. right price.
3,Not All Clad Quality - Cheaply made. Don't buy it !!!,I purchase two of these spice racks thinking I would be getting something reasonable. But All Clad let me down. When my spice racks came the metal on the rack was bent. I would have to say this was a poorly made set. The lids on the jars will easily wear away. Even on the first uses the lips were a little difficult to handle. The is not the typical quality of All Clad items- all I can say this was poorly made and spending this $30 something dollars on this is just way too much. This item is worth 75% less than the asking price. Not a great gift nor is it functional. It just sits in the corner on my countertop doing nothing.
1,Disappointing Kindle version,"The Kindle version of this book is very disappointing. As a reference book, it is virtually useless due to the lack of way to directly find and access the definitions. At a minimum, it needs an alphabetical index page that takes you to a particular word, term or phrase quickly and efficiently. Without this, the search function returns all instances where the word occurs thus making it very difficult to find the information desired. I hope future versions can improve on this."
3,A Nice to Have Dictionary,"From the preface of the dictionary: ""This dictionary is...a reference book that gives reliable definitions...of mathematical terms. The level is such that it will suit...college students and first year university students...The concepts and terminology...in pure and applied mathematics and statistics courses...are covered. There are also entries on mathematicians of the past...appendices...gives useful tables for ready reference."" This dictionary is not only a dictionary but also a handy reference book on table of areas and volumes, derivatives, integrals, series, trigonometric formulas, symbols, and Greek letters. Even though Internet provides a convenience mean to access the information, it is prudent to have a dictionary of mathematics for cross reference."
3,2nd Kino (Kyno) CD,"Strange almost live sounding CD from Kino (Kyno) during their early rise as a poetic anti-Soviet Russian Rock-N-Roll band. On this recording Victor Tsoy (Tsoi) lacks his normal deep mystery of a voice & sounds more like an early Bob Dylan. Maybe because Bob Dylan in the USA mid 1960's like Kino (Kyno) in the USSR mid 1980's wrote songs against war & social injustice. Some of his later popular songs like ""Trolley Car"" are here but most are of an experimental nature. This CD is very hard to find but I found it in Kiev Ukraine during our past vacation.For Kino (Kyno) fans only"
4,cute and comfy,"they are exactly like the photo (colors and design) the only problem was that they are a bit bigger so the fitting is kinda loose, maybe because they aren't supposed to be worn with socks, so keep that in mind, other than that they are really cute and I've gotten a lot of compliments for them"
4,"Wrong information, very old recording","The SPARS code listed as ""DDD"" led me to believe this recording was done in the mid-80's or so, but it was recorded way back in 1968 (Rite) and 1969 (Petrouchka). I didn't even know Ozawa was even working back then. These recordings are ANCIENT, and most certainly not digital. At any rate, it is an excellent performance of both, and the recorded sound and remastering is quite good. Ozawa has always been a champion of 20th Century music and you can hardly go wrong with him when buying recordings in the 20th century repitoire. My only problem, I already have enough great recordings of both of these that are from that era, and really wanted a modern, well produced one. Oh well, off to find another one. Amazon needs to correct the info here, and be more fastidious in general with information about these re-releases. I'm off to buy theSalonen / Los Angelesnow, which will be, what, my 12th recording of this? God."
3,"Good, not great.","This is a good performance at a bargain price. However, if you want a great performance, go to Stravinsky's own recording. If you want a great recording, find the Mercury Living Presence CD. So basically, I can't recommend this unless you're cheap and an Ozawa fan."
5,Astonishing Rite of Spring,"First, this is an excellent recording of the Rite. You start there. Ozawa and the Chicago Symph provide the most amazing interpretation and performance. Unquestionably one of the great compositions in music. Along with the wonderful sonic impression of the recording, you also have the breathtaking power and depth offered by precision playing by these fabulous musicians. I've been waiting decades for this version(missed it the first time around)."
5,This is an outstanding book!,"This book is written with great wisdom. The discussion of imagery as it relates to our life energy is excellent. I haven't found this connection in other books on imagery. If you're at all interested in the power of imagery, you'll find something of value here."
5,Top of the list for using imagery,"I'm biased. I took imagery training with Marty Rossman some years ago and found him down to earth, honest and real, as well as one exceptional practitioner of therapeutic imagery. He writes well too. I came in primed to appreciate his work as I had developed my practice from some of the same sources as Rossman and found that he had done an excellent job of integrating a number of useful techniques and placing them in a good technical context.I have seen clients of mine use the techniques in this book to alter the course of chronic and painful conditions. I have had personal success using these techniques, too. For the years I was teaching Imagery workshops, this was the textbook I used. It generally got excellent feedback from the workshop participants."
5,very good,"It's very good quality, and works very well. I ordered two of them, one for my camera, one for my big lens. I have been using it for years now, and it still works great."
2,Does Not Fit,"HelloI picked this up thinking I was getting myself the perfect anti-slip plate. It barely fit my Nikon D3000 (the lip on the plate just caught the edge of my camera) and then when I went to mount it, no love, it would not fit, it seemed thicker. Anywho I had to use the plate that came with pan head, and I guess just throw this in the pile. I suggest buying these plates in store if possible or confirming the models ahead of time."
3,not the most dynamic performance,"I am somewhat disappointed by this performance. The DVD contains Pat Metheny Group's recorded Japanese concert in 1995, interspersed with interviews.In my opinion, the transitions to interviews are rather abrupt, often cutting off the applause of the audience when a song ends.The performance of the songs are mixed. ""Antonia"" is the most memorable performance of the bunch. On some of Pat's older compositions the absence of Pedro Aznar is evident. For example, ""First Circle"" sounds strangely muted. For comparison, the same song performed in the ""More Travels"" video is much more dynamic.The live versions of songs for the album ""We live here"" were actually not bad. There are variations that make them interestingly different than the studio version."
3,Could Have Been Better,"This DVD was a disapointment. I was hoping to enjoy this DVD the way I enjoy the CD. The interviews after each song is a waste. The video could have been much better as well as the audio. rent it, not good enough to buy."
3,Not the best,"I loved I Spy. Wednesday nights when I was young was so to look forward to- that opening sequence and theme is still quite wonderful! And this paricular collection was enjoyable if only to see Scott and Kelly again, but this set of four seem more about the special guest stars than them, and so left me a bit wanting. It is like the basics of the show were assumed to be known and pretty much glossed over. I want the ones that are still ""proving"" Scott and Kelly... that was the good stuff!"
5,Jem is the Ultimate Cartoon!,"Jem is a brilliantly animated cartoon! It was well-written and very inspirational to our youth. I, and so many others feel that Jem should be back! The children of the 90's are being deprived of this wonderful cartoon! Bring Jem back Amazon! Jem is the Ultimate Cartoon! This particular video listed as Jem ""Truly Outrageous"" is the first five episodes of Jem, consolidated into one tape and made sord of into movie. This VHS is the beginning of the madness, the excitement, the glamour, the fashion, and the fame. Highly reccommended! Unfortunately, the only way Jem fans can get ahold of this tape is through expensive auctions, and dirty rotten bootleggers. Amazon, listen to our pleas! WE WANT OUR JEM TV!"
1,Do NOT buy this book!!!,"Do not buy this book!!!It teaches you how to be cruel to your horse!!!whoever wrote it should NOT be allowed to have horses!!!Is this what you should do to a horse:1-boot the horse in the belly...Get a lawn rake (the kind with flexible tines) and place it within grabbing distance. When your horse kicks, grab that rake and beat and rake the tine end on the horses rump and side in a wild manner.2-yell fiercely at it and kick it hard with your heels or grind your spurs into its sides...If your horse did not respond to your verbal ferocity and kick, use a short whip such as a riding cropto bat the horse across the rump3-""The best way to reprimand a rearer is to yell at it sharply, boot it in the ribs, and whack it on the rump"""
5,Just Great!,"I am a friend of the author, and having read this book I would just like to recommend it to everyone! I ride horses myself, and everything I have read is very insightful. If you are a beginning rider, or even someone who has ridden for a while, this book will definitely teach you a lot of things."
4,Good value - but not too practical for some 3 qt pans,"This steamer works great in the 3 qt. cassarole pan of the 10-piece set, but I'm afraid to use it in the 3 qt. sauté pan - that would allow only about 1"" of water or less in the pan. The steamer is very deep, which is nice, but I'd rather seen it not so deep so I could have a bit more water in the bottom. I've never boiled a pan dry using a steamer, but I've come close. What's nice is that once you get the water boiling (of course leaving the lid on so it does so quickly), you can turn down the heat quite low, almost down to a simmer, and still get a good amount of steam."
5,Great steamer,Emerilware is a great stepping-stone in cookware between the common store bought stuff and the extravagantly priced All-Clad type cookware. It is perfect for me. As a matter of fact I Like the slightly lighter weight of the Emeril line as apposed to the All-Clad. The only thing that I don't like is that I noticed the newer pieces from the last six months or so is made overseas. I don't recall that they were before. This steamer fits the 3-quart lidded casserole pan and 3-quart saucepan perfectly. It also fits the 2-quart saucepan but as another reviewer mention it does not leave much water in the bottom of the pan. I do wish that the emerilware line would come up with a double boiler with the same configuration as the steamer.
5,So much better than a basket steamer!,"Agree that you really need to use this steamer with the 3 qt saucepan, not the 2 qt in order to be sure you don't boil the pan dry. I love All Clad but am not willing to pay the price. I find Emerilware to be a fantastic alternative. I haven't been able to find this steamer in a store so I'm thrilled to find that Amazon has it. Great for veggies."
2,"product is fine,to bad amazon survice isnt","Like the product, but amazon screwed me out of the 30 dollar bonus for signing of for their card, they have sent me through more hoops than dumbo to try and get my money."
1,Holster is too small for the LG VX7000,I was so excited when I found that a clip for this phone was available that I had to order it. I have been searching for a few months with no luck. I received the holster today and it is simply too small for the phone. I will check reviews on items that I plan to purchase from now on. It appears that Wireless Technologies has mislabelled an entire shipment of this holster. I hope the cellphone battery that came in one of their boxes will work for my phone.
1,wrong product again,This is the second time i have ordered this holster and this is the second time the wrong item was sent. The label on the box says it is a holster for the verison lg vx700 but it is simply the wrong item and the box is mislabeled.thansk
5,LISSETTE AT HER BEST,"IVE BEEN A LISSETTE FAN FOR YEARS SINCE I WAS A CHILD AND THIS IS DEFINETELY ONE OF HER BEST ALBUMS EVER.HER VOCAL PERFORMANCE IS AMAZING,THE SONGS ARE BEAUTIFUL.WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?.A MUST HAVE FOR ANY TRUE LISSETTE FAN."
1,A Total waste of money and time,I have to say that this book is yet another attempt of a so called security professional to rip off the consumer. There is absolutely no information in this book on how to circumvent an alarm system. His circumvention techique can be summed up in two steps: if the alarm system is disabled and you are already inside the house(hello!) twist the wires together which are connected to the transmitter. Otherwise cut the phone line. Gee thanks for the insight. Please don't waste your [money] like I did as this buck isn't worth a penny.
1,A nice con to get peoples money.,"I am a certified and licensed alarm tech for 28 years and in the business for 16. While these statements are somewhat true, they are known by quite a few. But what is not known is the proper way of setting up the circuits which was never explained and most installers never do right because everyone else does their installs that way. I won't get all technical or go into detail here but proper placement of eol is the strongest link to any system. If the system is done the proper way you can't defeat the devices easily within the time delay. And further more some manufacturers make their systems to respond to such attacks and warn of such at command centers and the monitoring station. Only the phone line can easliy be defeated if left the way the phone company installs them which has been known for years as one of the weakest link. And you can also back the system up with long range one or two way radios."
3,"Great chips, bad packaging","I bought these chips after getting a bag out of a vending machine and being very impressed with the taste. Unfortunately the box of 60 that I received had over 20 bags with the seam up the back of the bags that were not sealed, so thumbs down on their packaging and quality control."
4,Great chips,"I found these chips in the vending machine at work and fell in love with them. Nicely flavored, great crunch. Perfect afternoon snack for work."
4,Chakras,This book by Harish Johari well explain about the Wheels of energy fields / centers in our body. For a better visual images please look at Alex Gray sacred mirrors
1,Very Confusing,"Why Not?This book is very confusing, it uses a lot of sanskrit words,which just makes it impossible to comprehend.The information is presented with no form, they're is no way to remember everything. The book has no life in it.The book needs more pictures, and the use of english terms instead of sanskrit.If you are trying to learn about chakras, and yoga, this isn't the book for you.It is like a sanskrit dictionary.The part that really bugs me, is that it says the book is about chakras, when most of it is about Yogi Meditation.Expect for that, the book has nice pictures (but few) and very descriptive."
4,Growing Profits,"Very practical guide with startup cost scenarios, tax implications and space required formicro farming."
2,Not much useable info but some good ideas.,"Only one paragraph on greenhouses, no wonder he only can make a few thousand. You really need a greenhouse to grow your starts in this business and to have only a little on this subject tells me alot..( he never made it big) There is no mention of caring for the enviorment here, The use of posins are recomended and no real overall plan for runoff or water table poulution, guess he doesn't care. Any way if you got extra bucks, get it cause one good idea can be worth the price."
4,"Great stands, good price","I've had a pair of these holding largish B&W 602 S2's for years. I've moved with them once. They're solid and unobtrusive. The carpet spikes are great (and removable). Be sure to fill them with something (sand, lead shot, bb's, rocks) to weigh them down."
2,"I love the Novela, but this DVD is bad....","I knew this Novela would be chopped up, but not like this. They left a lot of stuff that was not necessary and deleted some very important scenes. It seems like they added a lot in the beginning, then heavily edited at the end of the Novela.What also angered me is that the last disc is also double sided, but only one has video. Why use a double sided DVD and only use one side when there is at least 2 more hours of story line they could of added?"
5,MARIMAR A GREEEEEAT SOAP OPERA!!!! :),"COMPRENLA TODOS LAS RECOMIENDO; MARIMAR, MARIA MERCEDES Y MARIA LA DEL BARRIO Y ROSALINDA POR SU PUESTO, . . . TODAS, TODAS SON EXCELENTES!!!!!Mari MarMaria La del BarrioRosalinda"
5,NO QUE NO??,OHH WHAT THE HELL I LOVE ALL THALIA'S NOVELASAND I THINK THAT ALL THALIA'S FANS OUT THERE SHOULD BUY IT!!I HOPE THEY RELEASE MARIA MERCEDES TOO!
4,Really good telenovela with Thalía,"Thalía plays Marimar, in this second installement of what I like to call the ""María series"" (María Mercedes, Marimar andMaria La del Barrio). So, Marimar, who lives in a coastal town, falls in love with Sergio, Eduardo Capetillo's character. Sergio marries her (kinda in a whim) but later falls in love with her. Yet, his stepmother hates Marimar and sets her up to go to jail, kills her grandparents and makes her believe Sergio doesn't love her. This sets Marimar in a path for revenge. She becomes a new and improved Marimar and assumes the identity of Bella. And of course everyone believes that she is not Marimar, cause this is a telenovela after all. The story then revolves about how these two characters fight aasint all the odds to be together.The telenovela is not as edited down as other ones. So, you get a pretty good picture of what the full series was like.Overall, this is a pretty good telenovela. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
2,Mari Mar,I am disappointed in this video. There is alot of the series that has been edited to the extent that much of the important chapters are not seen. This recording was not done properly and should be re-done.
3,It is what it is!,"This is a really good story of love, jealousy, hate and revenge. If you've never seen this novela before or haven't seen it since it first aired a decade ago....this DVD is for you. If you have seen it more recently, you'll notice what's missing and will not like this version."
3,"It's BLACK, not brown like in picture","Wasn't that hard to put together, although lining up the cam screws was a bit of a challenge.biggest issue is that i wanted one in brown / wood, which is what the picture shows, but the item i recieved is jet black / ebony.otherwise, seems fine"
2,Not their best CD,"Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised to see PTC's stuff is on Amazon! I went to Davis and was a pretty big fan, they got me started on the indie thing. However, the band seemed to gradually fall apart after lead singer Mark left, between ""Each Sold Separately"" and this CD. His songs were great, and even though I liked Mindy's songs and vocals, I think she was better used in a supporting role. There's only a few good original songs on this CD, they should have just released an EP.CRH is inconsistent, but ""CIA Chick"" and ""Swetty Betty"" are two of my favorite ska songs ever! ESS is more consistent and a lot of fun. I'd definitely recommend those albums ahead of this one.While I'm at it, it's a Homer Simpson sample (I'm guessing, having only a pre-release copy), and ""Pervert"" is the previously used song. If anybody knows what the indivisual PTC members are musically up to now, please put the info in a reply!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I needed another tripod to mount my Tascam DR7-MKII (digital recorder) for recording live gigs for the band. When they say lightweight, they also mean ""light duty"". It is ... adequate ... for holding up a 6 ounce digital recorder; I absolutely would not trust it to mount anything that is much heavier with the legs extended. It might make a decent table-top tripod for something heavier.This is also *very* delicate; I ripped off one of the brittle plastic feet just extending the legs for the first time. It still works and does what I bought it for, so I didn't return it.So, as the title says, you get what you pay for. It does the job I bought it for, but nevertheless I found the quality below even my minimal expectations.Gloob"
3,very light but hard to fold it back.,"I am glad that I bought this tripod!! I was a lil hesitant to buy it at first but after a lil research i bought this instead and thanksful that i did! My family and I will be in Washington, DC for the 4th of July and I cant wait to use this tripod! everytime we travel we sometimes ask someone to take a picture of us or one will be taking a picture.The tripod is really light! 16 oz to be exact. It is made of steel and the ends are made of rubber. The panhead is easy to maneuver, you can rotate it in full 360 degrees. It is easy to set up as well but it gets a lil hard to fold it back. the last leg is a bit thin.UPDATE: (Apr. 2010)I accidentally stepped on one leg last xmas and it bent 90 degrees!! haha! finally bought a nicer tripod."
3,Mini Tripod,This tri pod is functional but poorly constructed. I don't expect it to last very long but then again what can you expect for the price?
2,not able to get three legs to extend equally,At least that is not very easy to do-- takes effort. So fast and balanced set up is hard.
1,Trash masquerading as a product,This tripod is useless for two reasons which other reviewers have mentioned:1. The ball joint is loose and cannot be tightened which means that your camera will not stay in position if you let go; gravity will cause the camera to sag. What's the point of having a tripod if you have to hold the camera up while using it?2. The telescoping legs do not stay extended under the weight of the camera (dSLR) and will collapse at random. Better be ready to catch your falling camera before it hits the ground!
2,Great ... at first,"This really is/was a great solid, inexpensive tripod. The legs adjust easily and stay in place and it is a handy size to carry. But after the fifth or sixth use the pin that connects the tripod to the camera fell apart from the attaching wheel as I was attaching it to the camera. I can get the pin back into the tightening wheel (not knowing if it will hold) but then there is no way to get that assembly back under the plate that goes between that plate an the camera. There may be a tool to take the whole thing apart and repair it ... but not one that I have.JackieDigipower DP-TP100 Light Weight Compact Mini Tripod"
2,Too many bugs,As a long time user of PDA's I loved everything about this unit. I even got use to quirky interface to enter data on the run. If you plan to sync with Outlook 98 or ACT 4.0 just forget it. It just does not work. I spent hours on the phone with tech support and could never get it to consistently being over my data in the correct format. The problem seemed to be all true sync related. Stick to Intellisync or Hot sync manager if you sync data on regular basis. Palm Pilot is still the best on the market but just wait for version 2 of HandSpring
3,Rex organizer,"This is a nice product that has the advantage of being very compact as compared to other products in this category. However, I have experienced a great amount of problems in synchronizing with Outlook 98 contacts. Be wary of this problem if you are using these products. Also, the product does not include a calculator, which I find inconvenient"
3,Very pretty but may not be perfect,"These are very pretty mugs, but unfortunately one of them was flawed, most likely a manufacturer's defect because the finish was unevenly applied. Amazon was unable to replace the set because they ran out, but offered me a discount if I would keep it with only three of the mugs being good. I did because I plan to make individual gifts of the three mugs and fill them with candy and wrap them in colored saran wrap. My advice is to check that the top finish is evenly applied on all mugs."
2,Undecided,"This fry pan was included in a set that I purchased about 4 1/2 years ago. The copper core has split almost completely off of the bottom of the pan. The rest of the set seems to be o.k., other than the 2 quart sauce pan in which the copper core looks like it's beginning to separate. These two pieces are the ones I have used practically every day since I purchased it. I really liked the set until this happened. I did not abuse the cookware, this just seemed to happen with regular use. I would like to give the fry pan another try, perhaps the one I have just happens to be defective. If happens again, will will not recommend nor will I buy anymore of this cookware. I'm rather hesitant, however, considering the fry pan alone, costs half the amount that I paid for the 10 piece set!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"Bought this fan pan based on Amazon reviews - didn't see the pan in stores at the time. You do not get an All Clad pan at half the price. While the pan has a very heavy bottom and cooks OK, the sides of the pan are rather filmsy. My pan has a dent in it and I've never dropped it or banged it against anything. I feel that I could bend the sides of the pan with my bare hands if I tried."
2,This Fry Pan has Sticking Problem,Fry pan looks good but it has Sticking Problem!!! It is hard to clean the yellow stains. ;-(
3,Emerilware 12-inch skillet,I am somewhat disappointed with this product. It is not of the same heavyweight material as Emeril's other cookware.
3,"Great for a few years, then bottom falls off",I bought a set that included this pan 3 years ago. The copper bottom completely separated from the pan a month ago rendering it useless. The same thing happened to the smaller frying pan and the 2 quart sauce pan this week. These are the three pieces that I use the most. I am very careful with my cookware and my goal is always to buy once and keep it forever. I am disappointed in the longevity of the pan. Back to Le Creuset cast iron I go.
1,A relic in another language,"Even when translated into English, this book is nearly incomprehensible to the modern reader. It was published in the 1960s, but the author uses turn of the century academic language that is intentionally abstruse. I've read terse mathematical works and been able to penetrate many of them, but I certainly feel for anyone who has to use this unreadable book in their course like I do."
5,"All Clad MULTI COOKER, not All Clad Stainless","This is a great product at a great price, but don't confuse it with the three-ply All Clad Stainless line. This cooker has the aluminum disk attached to the bottom of the pot like their multi-cooker and the large stock pots, not aluminum sandwiched between two sheets of stainless.It is made in China, not the US. Of course if it was the standard stainless line it would cost a couple of hundred dollars.As far as cooking, I love it for cooking asparagus, broccoli crowns, corn or steaming small quantities of just about anything. We like ours so much that we have been giving them to our friends for gifts."
3,Made-in China not the US,"Would have given a 4 or 5 star if it was made in the US as the description claimed. However, the size is perfect for so many things. Beautiful to look at. Haven't used it yet so no reviews on its performance yet."
1,not induction ready,I bought this asparagus steamer on the assumption that it was induction ready. I had been told that all All clad products were suitable for induction cook tops. Sadly this is not the case so it is of no use to me.Be warned!
3,"Heavy, solid build BUT rusted after one use","Build very solid and sturdy, but after only one use it developed several areas of surface rust around the bottom inside corner. It hasn't inhibited the functionality of the pot but aesthetically it's annoying. Durability is my only complaint."
5,Asparagus the right way.,"I love asparagus, and I hate it when it isn't cooked right! This All-Clad Asparagus Steamer prevents me from ruining my favorite vegetable. It is easy to clean and easy to store. And for the price, easy to buy!"
5,Absolutely Loved It!!!!!!!!,I'm only thirteen and fell in love with Madeleine L'Engel's writing from her poetry to her great novels. If you love poetry you should really check this book out. The way Madeleine writes how she feels is just so breath-taking.
3,OK book,"Looking for a review for algebra and trig. It is OK, nothing special. Should have done some more research. It is a good basic book."
5,Math,I wouldn't exactly say that I've had fun times with this book.. butit arrived quickly and in great condition
5,adorable,Loved this little sheep.. cute small perfect size for my collection. I like the fact that it fits in my hand
2,Not the lamb in picture,Kind of disappointed because this lamb that is pictured was not what I received. Not very cuddly like the one pictured. The lamb I recived looks like a mini go go sheep from cloud b.
5,Nice!!!,"My baby loves this little sheep!!! It's soft, plus has a rattle that isn't noisy = perfect!! :) I highly recommend this toy."
4,"Cute, but isnt as it appears in the picture","Sleepy Sheep is very cute & SO soft, but it really isn't what it looks like in the picture. It is only 4-5 inches tall and sits upright. From the picture I would guess it to be kinda floppy, but it is defiantly an upright critter. My son is only 3 months, but when he can get ahold of it he seems to enjoy it. I would be disappointed, but it is just SO SOFT and cuddly, Im sure it will be around for a long time. My toddler dripped some chocolate milk on it & it wiped off easily with a wash cloth. I would recommend this product, just know that is is not as it appears in the picture."
3,It's Okay,This product is cute and it's way too small. I don't know if it worth that money. But the material was very soft.
3,Keep a Close Eye on the Wear,"I would give this rattle a higher rating because my daughter love it. I had to buy this rattle as a replacement when I noticed the other one I bought for her started coming apart at the seams along the arms and legs, which means the stuffing will come out. It didn't get rough treatment from her just what you'd expect. She shakes it a bunch and bites on its feet. I do recommend this rattle as long as you watch your baby closely with it. I suggest getting the turtle instead because it seems to be made better and you don't have to watch your child closely with it."
1,The first prodcut from here that I disliked,"I've had great experiences in the past with similar ties from this company but this one missed the mark. When mine was sewn the print was mis-aligned, so the design looks completely off center. I don't even wear it because it looks awful. I gave it to my sister to use as a belt."
5,FABULOUS !,"When I saw this purse, I knew I had to have it. It is quite the conversation piece, and it has lasted several seasons. I was a bit concerned with a light color, but it's the one I really liked. It washes by hand easily, so it continues to look like new. Very clever idea!"
2,Harveys seatbelt disappointment,"I was disappointed in this purchase. There is barely room for a wallet, checkbook, and a phone. For a ""medium"" size (and for the money), I expected to fit the basics easily."
5,great book,This book has information that all teachers can use to help in literacy methods and other language arts strategies.I would highly recommend purchasing it.
2,Entertaining.,"I enjoyed the off-beat writing style as a nice change from my usual authors. Characters were fairly interesting Jewish stereotypes but the story, whilst temporarily entertaining, was eminently forgettable."
3,Totally archtypical evil villain,"If you can get past the concept of a villain so totally evil, greedy, etc as this one is depicted, and a heorine who only realizes the depths of his perfidy much too late, then you can enjoy this book. It's plot is fast paced with a reasonable amount of suspense and the main characters capture your interest. Having not read the other books in the series I was a bit lost by certain references, though.I prefer more time spent on character development and less extravagant more everyday plots (and much more subtle villains) so I only gave it 3 stars. Enjoyed reading it but won't keep it."
5,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"The release date of this DVD is December, 2005?!?!?!?!?...thats FOUR YEARS FROM NOW...surely this is a typo.....if not, there will be a lot of Twilight Zone DVD collectors out there, like me, who are extremely disappointed"
2,Dissappointed....,"I thought this product would be wonderful since my seven month old really likes to sit up in the tub. I was still excited as I opened the box. Then I took it out of the box. This product is barely over half-full with the bean-bag beads. There is no support. When I pick it up, ALL the beads cascade to the bottom and leave the top half completely bead-free. The pictures don't really show the product you get. It's great as a LIMP beanbag. Nothing more. Since it is cloth, you also have to fill the entire bathtub while the water seeps through it. It does not hold its own water. I'm waiting to see if it dries in 24 hours."
5,"Potential buyer, please help with questions!","I have the original safer bather and I'm thinking about purchasing this item and the reviews so far have been very helpful, however I have a few questions I'm hoping other reviewers can answer who own this:1. the original is more of a cushion and the material mildews after a while, do the beads in this one do the same or is it a different material?2. how long does it take to dry?3. at what age would you recommend this product? would it be appropriate for a 3 1/2 month old who can't sit on his/her own?"
1,Bulky,"I didn't like this product because the cushion was bulky. I was looking for a tub that would be great for traveling and this is not one to buy. I finally ended up with buying an inflatable tub. Also, I tried to return the product and the company sent it back to me although I used their return mailing slip. If you just wanted to see what this looks like, don't buy it because you cannot return it."
5,7 Month old LOVES this tub!,"My 7 month old grew too big for his newborn tub and knowing how much he loved to splash, I searched for an alternative to a bath seat (which would restrict his ability to splash in the water... which he can get pretty involved in flailing his arms!). I decided to take a chance on this tub and am VERY happy with it. We've had it for about a month and so far it's been awesome. He's able to have freedom of playing in the water, but it provides a nice secure cushion to help keep him from sliding all over the place or knocking his head on the side of the tub."
3,Not the best choice for us,"The bumper is a cool idea and keeps our daughter from hitting her head, but she doesn't really get a bath when we use it. She is 6 months and weight 18 lbs and the bumper floats when she using it. No matter how full we fill the bath, the sides rise with the water line so when there is 7 inches of water in the bath, only 2 inches in with her. We used it a few times and are saving it thinking when she is bigger it will work better."
3,"Not great, but it works","This is filled with styrofoam pellets. Its nice, soft, safe for a baby. However you have to fill up the entire tub to whatever water level you want, it doesn't hold water. Probably would not buy again, but it did work ok."
5,Very good tub insert,My son is about 15lbs and just over 25 inches. He fits perfectly in this lying down. It supports his head and neck if he wants to lay back. My little guy loves it. It has a no slip bottom which I love. Hangs to dry right on the bar in the tub. No mildew smell so far. We've been using it for 2 months.
1,Terrible product,"Just bought this bath tub for my 10 month old, she barely fits in it with her legs stretched sitting upright, and the tub floats, so you have to actually hold the tub with one hand while holding the baby...and then it slips out from under the baby...its a disaster. Complete waste of money and annoying. Id put it back in the box and return it, but its a soaking wet beanbag now that weighs a ton, so I'm going to throw it away and write it off. I'd give it zero stars, but I couldnt choose that option. DONT BUY THIS."
1,Not meant for children under one year,"The description of this item totally omits the fact that this is for children over one year according to the manufacturer. Also, for my active 9 month old, this tub is an invitation to reach into the surrounding water and hit her head on the side of the tub. I'm just using it until I can find a proper bath ring."
3,My Daughter didn't like it..,"We have a set of twins, my boy did like, but my daughter kept crying so I didn't use it. I guess because of the feel..."
5,A definitely good read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Twisty, turny romantic fun. One of the best lesbian romances I've read. I hope the author writes more soon!"
3,lids,pricey!!!! But better than the old one that didn't have the metal rim around the outside edge. I had dropped my original one and it broke!
5,Great Father/Son project,"My son (9) and I did this together. I located the parts and he put most of it together. Finding the pieces can sometimes be a pain as there are SO many to look through -- especailly when searching for a little used or one of a kind piece. (This might be too frustrating for a kid working alone. I don't know any 7 year old that could do something like this by themselves.) We worked on and off for 4 days to get it finished. It's very fun to see it come together. Just make sure you have a place to put it when you're done as the final model is ~41 inches long! A bit pricey perhaps, but worth it as far as I am concerned. We're looking into getting the Space Shuttle next."
3,Sampling -- It's a Fleeting Bite of a lot of Photographers,"I'm sure that the artist photographers are masters in their field. However, the sampling introduced in this book barely made my mouth water (with the odd exception), let alone drool.If you're serious about photography, and less about the depiction of male beauty, this book is for you."
1,One of the worse books I've ever had the missfortune to read,"I think this definitely does it for me. After this I won't be buying any more of Holt's books.The ""hero"" was an insensitive, cruel, callous bastard, and as if this is not enough, a pimp. He seduces rich woman to swindle money out of them. Sorry, but after reading so many novels, that feature such wonderful heroes, I can't respect or like this one.The heroine I think I could have liked, in a different book. In this one, all I could feel for her was pity.Cheryl Holt has a very dislikable tendency to create male characters that behave in a completely and utterly dispicable way, but in the end, it is always the woman who comes back to him and seeks a reconciliation.If you like books where the female characters are week and abused, and where women are treated like garbage, read this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"I've enjoyed other Cheryl Holt novels, but this one was not worth my time or money. The hero is thoroughly unlikeable. The plot was non-existent. Holt wasted too many pages on sex scenes. What was the point of this book? To show that sex with love is always better than without it? We're romance readers. We know that already! Her heroine was exactly like all the women that the hero duped before he meets her, so to accept that he falls for her as opposed to his previous conquests, is unsupportable and unbelieveable. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,No substance,"I couldn't wait to finish this book - just so I could put it away. The characters had no substance, just physical attraction to each other. Even that seemed forced for the sake of having something to write about. The plot was too contrived, with appearances by outside characters thrown in an effort to move things along.I didn't understand why these characters got together or why I should care about them. I just didn't see the point of Ms Holt writing this book.I have not read anything else by Cheryl Holt, so I don't have other experiences to compare it with. I'm sure there are better books on the market."
5,6 Stars!!!,"Meoooowwww! This book is the best I have read by Cheryl Holt; an erotic mix of sex, true love, and inner battles with conscience come together to make Absolute Pleasure one of my absolute favorites. I highly recommend this book due to the believable characters and likeable co-characters. I think I just might have fallen in love with Gabriel myself. Before you read this, make sure you have a man handy to take care of any needs that may arise! Even the characters you hate get their just rewards. Two love stories in one, Absolute Pleasure was truly an inspiring read."
3,"sexy, but needs more","Book takes in London, 1812.Gabriel & Elizabeth are very attracted to each other & the tension just builds and builds. He's a portraitartist & a con man. He seduces, then bilks vulnerable women of their money. She's a curvy, sheltered 27YO, who allows hero to paint her likeness. Her father is wealthy, but allows her to have little money.John, his able-bodied father, depends on Gabriel alone to pay the bills. John needs a real job. Her fatherFindley, maintained a 20 year affair with his housekeeper, Mary. Mary seemed too assertive & blunt toaccept this arrangement for 20 years. Findley marries an immature 17 year old Charlotte to beget an heir.Charlotte undermines Elizabeth at every turn. Reading RE Charlotte compares to listening to fingernailsscratching a chalk board.The hero is cold/ indifferent to Elizabeth at intervals in the book. Both hero & Dad meet their ""soul mates.""And the book is certainly sexy. But the aforementaioned elements prevent a better story."
1,Overblown language alert!,"If you're at all sensitive to language that is trying WAY WAY too hard to impress, avoid this book at all costs. As Dorothy Parker once said, ""Tonstant Weader frowed up."""
2,Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1,"I am --------, and I have played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. An expressive work which requires great passions, Clayderman has often been too loud, breaking the melodious balance between the orchestra and the piano. I was tuned off already by the first few chords, which were struck too loudly. There also lacks a element of surprise and Russian animosity in this recording, which Jorge Bolet and Evgeny Kissin both capture in their recordings with Dutoit and Karajan, respectively."
5,Nearly 10 years later - still great!,"I bought these for my Harman Kardon bookshelf speakers nearly 10 years ago. They have been moved to 3-4 different houses and used on both carpet and tile. They're fantastic for the money and are as good as the day I took them out of the box. I have never filled them with sand, but I imagine it would make them even better."
2,Not for non-graphic designers,"I am a business person and I thought this book would be helpful to me in making better presentations--which often involve graphic representation of quantitative data. The book was way too serious though. I'm not saying it's a bad book, but it's clearly geared toward someone who wants to go in-depth on the topic--not someone who just wants some quick tips on better business presentations."
2,Book arrived damaged,"Ordered book new, and it arrived with the cover page ripped down the spine and several holes, dents, and scratches. Very disappointed in the condition it arrived."
4,Good overall but not very contemporary,"Good overall but not very contemporaryTom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLChttp://www.andersonanalytics.com"
5,Ultimately it's about truth-telling,"In the spring of 1998, I participated in a semester-long class taught by Edward Tufte.The subject was information design and his three books, Visual Explanations, Envisioning Information and The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, were the core reading materials of the seminar.Had I only read the books and not participated in the class, I might have missed some underlying core themes that Tufte conveyed through his passionate presentation of the material.Beyond just putting the right mark on a piece of paper or on a computer screen, these books are about truth-telling, about removing all impediments to understanding between the communicator and the receiver, and about being selfless in one's representation of the truth.Similar books just catalog graphical techniques. Tufte's books will leave most readers with an indelible sense of obligation to communicate transparently, selflessly and truthfully."
3,Not a text book but a knowledgeable friend,"Visual Explanations is not a usual book. It is like a knowledgeable friend walking with you through a museum: pointing out good design and bad ideas; linking various domains (graphic design, usability, psychology) together. You learn things slowly, almost by symbiosis. Visual Explanations will be enchanting for people who have the time to read it in that way. It will be frustrating for people looking for a practical guide: This is not a textbook. The book itself is beautifully produced.Topics covered include: clarity and purpose of information, color scheme choice, and composition of images."
5,A sensory/intellectual marvel.,"Dear Dr. Tufte,Your books are sensory and intellectual marvels. I was doing my thing at amazon.com (trying to spice up the Updike story) when I came across areview of Visual Explanations. I was so intrigued that I splurged my book money for the month and ordered it and its two predecessors sight unseen.I began at the beginning and just finished reading the last confection.I own no books that are as well-conceived as yours: the luscious heft and texture of the paper, the elegant placement of the unique, well- chosenillustrations, their accompanying complete and careful references in the margins, the clear intelligence of the text reflected in the preciselanguage, the overall feel that there is not one wasted word or image. These books are the best examples of how-to-really-make-a-book that I haveever seen. Please accept my compliments on a job exceedingly well done."
5,A must-read for anybody with something to tell,"In this book, an expert of visual explanations uses visual explanations to tell us his ideas how to use visual cues to explain concepts, quantities, timelines etc. Tufte, with his eternal self-confidence and succinct prose gives good examples and shows how a good image can be better; gives bad examples and has no hesitation to call something (even authorities' products) 'ghastly' or 'nightmare'. I think this book is a must for anybody who wants to use visual cues and examples for the ideas they want to convey. That is, everybody, in this time and age of information."
5,What a place for ideas!,"Tufte uses beautiful, old examples to show timeless good design. When I need a ""brainbooster"" in my work as a multimedia designer, I gravitate to his book(s) and just flip pages. There is always something there that strikes a spark and gets me moving again. Chapter 4: ""The Smallest Effective Difference"" especially helps me remember to scale down graphic contrivances and let the content shine through. I wouldn't recommend this book for a solid cover-to-cover read, but as an addition to a designer's bookshelf it is definately high on my list."
1,Nowhere Near As Great As They Claim,"Decided to grab one of these as a replacement to another bullet that had died and well, they do say you get what you pay for. If you're looking for something that is intense, keep shopping, because this isn't what you want."
1,Ripoff product and seller,"I received the silver buller in non working order and filed a claim which they rejected because ""Health and Personal Care products (cholesterol monitors, glucose monitors, fragrances, thermometry etc.) cannot be returned"".They sent it in non working order. Take it back and send me a new one (that works) or send me a new one (that works) or refund my money. I will not spend another dime on anything sold by ""My Health Stores"". I have spent thousands of dollars with Amazon this year alone and this it the first time I have ever had a problem getting resolution for receiving a faulty product. Stay away from this product and this seller."
2,Do not waste your money,"This cute little bullet may seem like a good deal but it is the complete opposite. It was great the first time I used it but wouldn't even turn on the second time. It would be a very good toy, if it had continued to work....."
1,Not expected,It was great for the first day...afterwards...nothing...need to replace it with batteries every day..and don't even use it a lot
5,Love,"This item is my favorite of all times:) It's cheap and affordable! Nothing wrong with it at all, just a very nice product!"
3,Works but is not as shown in the picture.,The item in the picture i have been using for years! but every few months the wire goes to hell & i always have to reorder. When this silver bullet got to me it in no way looked like the one that i have been using for years & looks nothing like the one that is in the item description picture... that bothers me. Also putting batteries in the one that they sent to me is a b*tch you have to fight with the thing in order for the batteries to fit in it. Shipping also took forever! but it gets the job done & that is the only reason why it got three stars lol.
2,Breaks easily,"This product broke only after a couple uses. None of the cords were severed or anything like that, it just stopped vibrating indefinitely. I'm one of those people who reads reviews that say it broke right away, and I usually say ""Yeah, whatever, just bad luck, won't happen to me"" but this one really didn't last more than a couple days."
2,Incorrect Description,"Once I got this put together it was fine. But I was not expecting it to need to be assembled and was not happy about having to spend the time to do it. Be forwarned!!Also, although this size was fine I also bought the next size up for a larger TV and the unit could not handle the weight. Those of us that still have our picture tube TV's know how heavy they are. We have an older 24"" Sony Trinitron (which still works like a champ)- but this unit cannot support it. The metal undeath that allows it to swivel simply cannot hold the weight."
1,"""...VIRTUALLY OBSOLETE.""","These are the author's own words describing this work. A statement I came across which he included in one of his emails pitching a recent ""Busting Loose live event"":""4+ years ago, I made a discovery that changed everything for me. I began to share that discovery under the label of my ""Busting Loose"" work.If you're familiar with my Invisible Path to Success or 11th Element work, my discovery, quite to my surprise, made both bodies of work virtually obsolete.""I thought some of you readers of this earlier work might be interested. I personally find it interesting that he continues to profit from this ""obsolete"" piece of work."
2,Was open to going to the movies,"I liked the book till the end, when the author gave his website address for a follow-up report. That report, in my opinion, was so childish that it made me feel foolish for having read the book! I can suspend disbelief quite well and have done so most of my life; but I now shake my head in disbelief for having read the entire book!"
2,O God why am I so stupid?,"Reading through book, I hade a strange filling that I already know author idea from somewhere. Then at chapter ""nine"" I finally got the revelation from a template latter for my movie director (idea from the book). Ha. This is the same idea us in ""The 11th element"" and yes also author is the same. Only big difference is that in this book there is no grandfather who give him the system us it is in ""The 11 element"". He just changed his idea from CEO to Movie director, which lives in clouds above your head, waiting on you letter. Shame on me! My advice: When you are deciding to by a self help books from reviews please read how many people have really made something from it.Just believe in what you want, do what your intuition tells you, respect your body and breathe, clear your mind of negative chat and you are on the path to the VISIBLE success. Yes, I do not recommend this book."
1,May not be for you,"This author has some very unique points of view. If you hold traditional Christian views this book will probably not appeal to you. Reincarnation and use of psychics are one area of disagreement, but there are many others. If you have ever been a victim of a crime or accident it will not make you happy to read that the author states that happened to you because you chose it. There may be an audience for this material but I will stick with Anthony Robbins, and Jim Rohn in the future."
5,Invisible Path to Success deserves an Oscar!,"Okay, so that was a corny title, but I thought it would be fun to continue with the ""your life as a movie"" theme from the book. I definitely enjoyed this book, and I devoured it in a day. The best thing is that the concepts are SO EASY to apply to your life! And Scheinfeld does a great job of teaching you the important points so that you remember them.Okay, you say, so it's easy to apply and you can remember the important points....but does it work? The answer is YES! I've put a number of ""ads into the network"" and so far, almost everything that I've asked for has manifested in my life. The book also left me with a sense of peace, happiness and more control as far as what happens in the next scenes of my ""total immersion movie""--my life. I'm looking forward to the next volume in the Invisible Path Series!"
4,"A unique outlook on what life is, and one that makes sense.","I was expecting a motivational style book, but found that Scheinfeld delivers more than expected; A unique philosophy on how and why we accomplish what we do. If you are willing to accept his strange and beautiful concept of how we succeed, and are willing to follow him on the path of directing your own life story, he offers a way to write the script as you live it. His vision of what life actually is, and why things are the way they are, has given me a new perspective on ""what it's all about"". Like any great idea, it is fascinating and discomforting and irresistable."
1,poorly weighted,i've been using this pot for 5-6 years and am unhappy with it. i'm surprised all-clad made it and a famous chef like emeril put his name on his. the pot is poorly weighted. its significantly bottom heavy. have not had this problem with another pot. the problem is pronounced when pouring and straining liquids from the pot. its awkward to lift when washing and transporting from sink to drainer to cabinet to stove.
5,An AWAIR Pick!!!,"This extensive anthology was edited by one of the world's leading scholars on contemporary Islam, who has succeeded in compiling a comprehensive reference on Islam and Islamic culture, useful for those with or without previous knowledge. Sixteen scholars address topics such as law and society, art and architecture, Islam in Asia and Africa, and the globalization of Islam. This reviewer has read and re-read Vincent Cornell's entry, Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: The Relationship Between Faith and Practice in Islam. It has deepened my understanding and given me language to describe what it is that I ""know"". In a perfect world (one where we all had unlimited expense accounts), I would make this the textbook for a high school or undergraduate course on Islam. That's how good it is. You or your library must own a copy!Teachers/Librarians: 9th grade - adult, social studies/humanities. A must in every library!"
3,"inconsistent, but informative","This history of Islam is a putative book for beginners and scholars alike. However, I doubt that absolute beginners will find the book useful. Too many times the authors barrage the reader with names of Islamic movements, terms, place-names, and people. Often they do this and fail to provide much needed explanatory background.That being said, many of the chapters are excellently written and supremely informative. From the Prophet Muhammad and the early Caliphate, to Islam in the global world, almost every important topic is covered. The book is also extremely fair and balanced in its coverage. There is no Bernard Lewis venom, nor cheap apologetics toward Islamic societies.I would recommend this to a novice with some background. A true beginner's book it is not, but a truly enlightening book it certainly is."
4,"Snap, Crackle, Pop!","If you haven't ordered a High Performance CD, you're really missing out. This particular release for me falls below some of the others. But it's still fun. The main work, the ballet music based on ""Carmen,"" is quite unusual. All of the familiar themes are there, but with a lot of bombastic percussive inflictions. There's some tinkering with some of the themes, and where you expect to hear them, but it's all part of the surprise of the recording. This is a fun CD for driving down the highway. There are a lot of bells and whistles, all in the Fiedlerian tradition. If that's what you like, you shant be disappointed. I also recommend the recording of ""The Rite of Spring"" (with Seiji Ozawa), and the Mahler CD. Each are part of the High Performance series and are very thrilling. There's also a High Performance recording with Eugene Ormandy and his Philadelphia Orchestra which, for me, sounds more like a run through than a high performance."
5,A Book for All Ages,"This book is not vey popular but, in my opinion, is one of the best books ever written!!! It is a thrilling story with many intertwined adventures.I think kids of all ages could read it because of the age difference of all the characters to relate to. It is also a good book for adults to share!!!This is why ""In Care of Cassie Tucker"" is one of the best books ever written!!!"
1,Only pan I have ever thrown away new,I have never had a pan like this. Even after seasoning it everything stuck to it. No matter what temperature or how much oil I used. It ruined 3 dishes before I hucked it into the trash - BAM! I realize it is not non-stick. And I was using it to get a fond. Instead I got permanently glued meat. I cook almost every day. I have no problem with my similar Calphalon pans. This thing was like a sheet of superglue.
4,I cook for a living...,"I bought one of these for my kitchen at home and, Yes...it is from China, No...it's not 3 ply but yes...it is the best stock pot for the price!!!I have equiped many a professional kitchen and if you are looking for a STAINLESS 16 qt. stock pot with a 3 ply bottom AND a lid in a professional line get thee to a bank loan officer. A stock pot of this height for home use doesn't need to be 3 ply up the sides so this one is adequate.Do get back to me if you find a better 16 qt. stock pot at a better price.We slap 4 mojo*z on dis bad boy!"
4,Good to have!,"It's great to own these immortal classics! Nevertheless it is a pity that there are no bonus materials. I am sure there are some outtakes or the French language versions in the Paramount vaults. But to own and study the films itself is a wonderful thing. I am desperately waiting for a release of ""Paramount On Parade""!!! To present ""The Merry Widow"" including the French version (!) would be a great gift to all Lubitsch fans and film historians!!! ""If I Had a Million"" and A Royal Scandal"" are at least released in France on DVD.Thanks in advance to the distributors!News!!! ""Broken Lullaby"" is released in France too. Fine print but french subtitles which are not removable. Just a film historians commentary in french as bonus on the DVD, but nevertheless - great to have! It's a ""Royal Scandal"" that is not released in the US yet. ""That Lady in Ermine"" is out in Germany - fine print that one."
3,Good and bad poems,"I'm quite mixed up about this book of poetry. Some of the poems rhyme, have an easily identifiable rhythm and make perfect sense. Others don't rhyme, have no rhythm and make no sense at all. I prefer poems that don't rhyme and don't have a rhythm, but reading some of these is like swimming through mud. Sometimes you'll be reading along, understanding fine, and then suddenly a line will come sailing in from Neptune, completely incomprehensible. In some poems each line makes sense by itself, but it will have nothing to do with the lines preceding and following it. I gave this book 3 stars since I liked some of the poems a lot, while some were gibberish. Like all of these free books of poetry I've read so far on my Kindle, the formatting is like prose (in paragraphs) rather that like verse (in lines). This makes reading some of these poems even more difficult."
5,History never taught,"One Man's Hero depicts an important part of United States and Mexican history that is not taught in the schools in the U.S. It tells the story of persecuted Irish immigrants landed in the U.S., moving to and becoming Mexican citizens and their role in the subsequent Mexican-American War making them Mexican heros. In Mexico, St. Patrick's day celebrates the heroism of the San Patricios. The history does not compliment the U.S. government and therefore is most likely the reason those of us in the U.S. have not been told about it. While the movie seems to drag in the begining, subsequent viewings reveal more important details to the viewer. While I would not give the movie 5 stars, the importance of the story itself surpasses the average qualtiy of directorship and hollywoodizing and therefore deserves 5 stars in the knowledge it reveals."
1,Hokey-Pokey History,"Why spend so much money on falsh information. Any San Patricio that was branded deserted before May 13, 1846. General Taylor Didn't set foot into Mexico until May 18.You see the deserters leave the army in Mexico. Why wasn't O'Riley Hung? You read the true history."
1,Watch paint dry!,"If you like ""Kelly's Hero's"" this might just be for you, but don't waste a $1.75 for it!Unless you need kindling"
1,A Disaster,"This mess is a real disaster. Facts are distorted, the acting and accents are horrible. Add god-awful fight scenes and a noticeable lack of musketry and you have one really rotten film. But films about the Mexican War are few and far between, so if you collect media on this subject keep a barf bag handy."
2,"Decent flick, but not worth buying","I watched this movie on the satellite dish one day when I had nothing else to do. It was a decent enough action yarn, but not worth buying or renting. As said before, the dramatic license taken was excessive, even by Hollywood standards. The love interest was unnecessary, and the history was skewed at times. Although the unit was named The San Patricio Battalion, not quite half the soldier's were Irish. Close to another half were German Catholics and the remainder were a small mix of native born Americans or other immigrant Catholics. This is the first treatment the cinema has given the Mexican War in a long time, if ever, and I was disappointed they did not do better. The plot was stretched thin at times and overly romanticized."
1,Really Poor Effort,"Poor research and a stingie budget has resulted in a rather average collection. Not much detail on each character, facts are wrong for example Jason's from Friday the 13th true passion is not chainsaws, in fact I don't remember him ever using one and the blurb does not mention his mum watched him drown in Camp Crystal Lake. Another example of poor research is Homer Simpson. He does not say Hmmmm, he says Mmmmmm. Obviously Seth has not watched a lot of TV or rented a movie in his life.The layout of this book is boring. Paying a bit to copyright owners would allow a few more pictures other than the seldom black and white photograph but usual third blank column. To qualify for this book (outlined in the introduction) why must your primary residence be the USA when the title of this book is not American fictional people? Don't waste your money!"
1,Not worth it,"This amp claims to push 1000x2 and i can tell you it does not. its a very terrible amp, only reason it gets one star, it looks nice. i have two power acoustik mofo 10's. i was using a ts1920 power acoustik 2 channel and it was pushing 450 max per channel and the subs banged real hard. mofos require atleast 1000 watts rms per sub at 2 ohms. so i checked the lanzars ratings on this and 1,000 per channel at 2 ohms rms looked like a perfect match. i bought it, hooked it up and have never been so dissapointed in my life. this thing barely made the subs move and i had everything tuned to the max. do not waste ure effort with this amp!"
5,My daughter loved this book!,This was a winner! My 3-year-old daughter loved listening to me read about the little mermaid and her search for a friend as she placed jewel stickers on each page. I have liked all of the jewel sticker stories. And she enjoys reading them over and over even after she has placed all of the stickers.
3,Good,My five year old loves the land before time. This product is really geared for younger child I would say 3 or 4 but she enjoyed it anyway. There is not a whole lot to do so I would not purchase it unless your child is a die hard fan like mine.
4,Where Documentaries meet the X-Files.,"Phenomenon is composed of international news footage to explain strange tales of government research, criminal endeavors, and hidden power brokers. Dean Stockwell who hosts the program, gives the stories an air of mystery and validity. If you like the X-files and enjoy news documentaries, you'll love this series. I recommend it for anyone who questions ""What's really going on"" or ""What ever happened to that story?"""
2,too small to be very useful - unless you are cooking for one,"I have a set of stainless Emerilware and have been extremely pleased with it. I ordered this pan not knowing that it was so small.I returned it and got a 12"" Calphalon Triply everyday pan. While I do not actually use it ""everyday,"" I use it quite often and like it very much.Emerilware is heavier and nicer overall, though. Too bad they don't make a larger everyday pan."
3,Smaller than expected,"I was looking forward to this pan. The pan is a heavy duty pan. Love the glass top, rather than a metal one so you can see how things are cooking. HOWEVER, the decription does not tell you that the size of the pan is only 3 qt.The pan is small and will be able to accomodate smaller meals, perhaps for one or two people. It will not be helpful for a double batch or larger meals."
1,product tips over,"Recently my husband bought two different size pans 8""and 10 "". They transfer heat well but tip over. Consequently we are very disatisfied with emerilware. I asked him why he din't think they were tippy? They are both shaped like a bowl. I'm sure if emeril tried cooking with either one of these pans he would quickly throw them to the dogs and trash whatever. I am going to call customer service at kitchen ect. tomorrow and see if we can get a better pan."
1,meh,"worthless. More product promotion than anything else, same with following the Atkins weekly plans..product promtion. That's all there is to this"
3,looks nice for Americans,"For Americans, it looks like a good thing to have as a reference guide. For those elsewhere, it's less than useful as it is focussed completely on US (and maybe Canadian) brands and products.Of course for Americans too, its value is affected by its age. Publications like this need to be regularly updated as products appear and disappear from supermarket shelves at a sometimes alarming rate, and the composition of existing products can change almost overnight without so much as a change in the product labels (just the ingredient list changes).For people on a special diet, the latter is especially troublesome. For people following Atkins it'd potentially mean getting more carbs than intended, for people with food allergies it can be disastrous.Therefore, use it as a guide but don't follow it blindly. Do check product labels even if the book says it's ok as things may have changed in the 2 years since it was published."
5,GREAT Diet!,This book is all you need to start this fantastic diet. The website is free sign up (unlike weight watchers). So you pay once for this book and you are ready to go for as long as you want. I would recommend buying the Atkins Cookbook with it but it is definitely not necessary.
5,A#1 Quality,"A#1 Quality, Heavy Duty nice for getting into obstructed situations. Gearwrench lifetime warranty, What else can you ask for."
5,Awesome Answering Machine,"I purchased this plus an inexpensive cordless to replace my VTech-2960 because, two years after purchase, the VTech turned out to be a costly piece of junk! My kids had this Casio model and were really pleased with all of it's features and its dependability so I decided to get one also. It's great - it has more features than you expect with an answering machine (e.g. Caller ID, remote access, ringer, speakerphone, two outgoing message capability and more) plus it's really easy to program, which is nice for a change! The thing that I like the best though, is the fact that you can program this machine to send the unavailable numbers on incoming calls right to the message center - hasta la vista telemarketeers! No more dashes to answer the phone and then wonder why you bothered. That alone is worthwhile, as far as I'm concerned, but overall I'm very pleased with everything about this answering machine."
2,no remote access?,"Without remote access, a longer message recording time (why not a half hour?), and provision for more than one local area code, this seems rather limited and old-fashioned."
4,AC Delco Filter,Great filter for the price. I was disappointed that AC Delco discontinued the use of the foam pre-filter on this particular filter. Don't buy this filter if you are expecting the foam pre-filter.
5,Best Harley !!!,"This Harley Softtail is well worth the money. These Mega Bloks are so realistic they should be considered models,not toys. But either way they are fun to build, play with, and just admire!"
3,Description wrong,"Product is a useful resource, however, the description states 150 pages; only 50 pages. Is only Cycle A -- not all cycles."
2,"Good Basic CD's, but lacking written accompaniment","Good basic CD's, to give you some rudimentary vocabulary, basic pronunciation, and some common phrases / short sentences. Pretty well done, at an easy-to-follow pace. The only thing that frustated me personally was the lack of a written accompaniment, showing the written version of all the words & sentences you are learning on the cd's, preferably with phonetic spelling also, as many language courses have. Unfortunately, there is NO written material with this program at all, except a small booklet that has some written words that go along with some brief pronunciation sections on the cd's."
3,media cabinet,"This product took to long to get to me.When it did arrive it was missing the instruction booklet for assembly.It is OK but you have to disassemble this unit if you do not plan on the correct amounts of each media componets.Such as cds dvds vhs etc.Would I recommend this Item,probably not.Would I buy this again probably not.For the money spent and the extra time involved with the manufacturer it isn't worth the price."
2,"Good info about Tony, poorly written","Since I am a very big Tony Robbins fan, I decided to buy this book. As many other reviewers have said, this book was poorly written with a lot of misspelled words. Furthermore, it was poorly laid out and very cheap looking. I can't believe that this book could ever sell for its list price if it was in the bookstore and someone could actually look at it first. However, I did give it two stars because it did contain information (if true) that I did not know about Tony's history and background. Seeing this book also gave me a lot of hope for the book I am currently writing. I am sure that I can do a much better job!"
1,This is a rip off,"Save your money, buy a book by Robbins himself. All this guy did was throw some facts about Tony together, quite badly, mispell about a million words and then charge for it. Do yourself a favor, spend fifteen bucks and get Awaken the Giant Within, its much better written and a lot more value for the money. Go to the movies with the other fifteen bucks, you'll be glad you did."
2,Nice try....,"As I understand it, this is apparently the first non-fiction biography on Anthony Robbins. No one has ever written and published one before. For that, I commend the author for undergoing such a project.I was surprised at the length of this book. I finished reading it in half a day. It was also a somewhat disappointing read. I don't want to get into specifics but the author basically took facts and filled in the blanks with rhetoric. On the other hand, I was not COMPLETELY dismayed. I appreciated the author's objective views."
1,SCAM!!!!,"Here's a little hint. Go through all the reviews for this book. Notice that most of the five star reviews are riddled with bad spelling and grammar. Take note that many of the one star reviews mention poor spelling and grammar within the book itself. Now draw you're own conclusions, but I for one suspect the author has been submitting his own raves to boost the average review. You may also want to go to the book ""Thank you, Tony Robbins"" and read the negative review of that otherwise well reviewed book and notice that the author of the bad review is the author of ""The Life Story of Anthony Robbins"".The author doesn't strike me as the brightest spark in the fire, but hey - if Robbin's theories can work for morons maybe they will work for anyone."
1,"Show me your money, or credit card","In my opinion this is sadly a missed oppurtunity to educate the public, but not a missed oppurtunity to cash in!"
1,COMPLETE RUBBISH !,I am forced to agree with the negative reviews below.All the 5 star reviews seem to be written by the same person !Except the one below ! LMHO>>>I would suggest you read all the reviews below and make your own mind up !!!!!
1,Not Worth Your Money,"I have never read a dry boring book like this. The book starts abrubtly with unsubtatiated facts. I think the author lost focused when he was writing the book. It seems he concentrated so much on how much money and glory he will get by writing the book. Do not buy it. Rather buy books by Mr Robbins himself, and you can find them right here cheaper.This book reminds me of William Shakespeare's potent quote; ""It is a tale told by an idiot... full of hype BUT signifying nothing"""
1,Robbins should disassociate himself from this trash,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I like Tony Robbins' books and tapes and thought this would be a chance to learn more about him. Well, I learned nothing new and wasted my money. Although I expected the book to be positive about Tony Robbins, I was surprised that it was written in such a sycophantic manner. It was also very poorly written and had all the elements of a rush job. Mr Bolduc would benefit from a basic writing course and some research skills. It looked to me that he was wondering how he could profit from his association with Tony Robbins and figured that writing a book was the only way possible. The problem is that he's not any good at it. Do yourself a favour and spend the money on something by Robbins himself."
1,A Piece Of Garbage!!!,"This was the first book I ever bought from Amazon.com, and the only one I have ever returned. It is a total waste of money. All the author has done is piece together bits of information Tony mentions himself in his own books and tapes. Bolduc couldn't even do that right, as the book is filled with poor spelling, incomprehensible grammar, and annoying chronological back and forth jumps. Although still not doing justice to Tony, the A&E Biography was infinitely better than this worthless piece of trash. And watch out! Bolduc may have watched that show and decide to write a follow-up. Don't let him or any of the 5-star reviews fool you."
3,Good educational material....,I mostly read this book for educational reasons because I had only recently heard about Tony Robbins. I wanted to know more about him. What I liked best about this book was the fact that it was very easy to read. The matter-of-factly tone of the book was appreciated. There was no beating around the bush what the ultimate secrets to success (according to Tony) were. Lots of helpful tips in here.Well worth my time reading.
4,A job well done,"When I bought this wonderful book, I was very happy because now I get to read about Tony's background information and his secrets about how he got to where he is, how he became who he is. GROW RICH QUICKLY! Tony Robbins is a hero to us in Japan. He teaches us excellent things. He is a real inspiration. This books tells me why. I appreciate the good information in it. There is so much of it! Obviously, a lot of research was done. I raise my glass and say 'cheers' to the man who wrote it! Job well done!"
1,don't buy it,the car-adapter would not work it's the wrong one.I e-mailed the customer service. but unfortunately they sent me another box. still it has the wrong car charger.
1,same problem as everyone else,They must have gotten a deal on the car adapter for the 6000 model and are substituting it in the 7000 kit. I found out way too late to return it and got screwed. Don't buy from these people they are scamming customers.
2,"The case is great, but.....","When I received the kit is was immediately obvious that the car-adapter would not work in my LG VX7000 (Black). I love the case and could care less about the cheap earpiece, but had to return the entire kit because of the car adapter.."
1,Power Cord NOT Compatible with LG VX7000BK,I had to send the kit back because the power adapter was not compatable. I didn't try the ear bud.
5,Greate Show,"Its a great great show. Definitely the best TV show I have ever watched. If you have never watched it definitely buy the DVDs you will be glad you did. If you have watched it, you already know this.Why does the DVD cover picture Jake driving a convertable with the top down when the bomb is going off??"
5,Surprisingly excellent!!,"I didn't start watching Jericho, till the season was half over. I was flipping channels and stopped on CBS for a moment and started watching the last 20 minutes of an episode. Just that little bit hooked me. I was intrigued, had to know more. I went to the CBS website and watched the season from the beginning. It took me a couple of nights, but I was compelled to watch them and get all caught up. I was so upset when I finished, it was on a Thursday night and I had to wait for the next week, to see the next episode. I am so looking forward to purchasing this set and to the new season. I am hoping that Jericho will be around for many more seasons. Not only is Jericho entertaining, it makes you think. I am soooo sick of ""reality"" based programing."
3,"KS native says ""should have done their research""","I really wanted to love this series...But if you're from Kansas or any of the surrounding area, this show will be somewhat annoying. The plot is a great idea and the characters are interesting, but they didn't do their home work when it came to that region. There are multiple screen shots with mountains in the background, which they think are acceptable if they repeatedly flash clips of KS license tags on the vehicles. Not to mention their references to area geography are absolutely ridiculous when they discuss direction and distance between specific places. They also seem to think Kansas is known for corn, which is not the case...Perhaps some folks will find it nit-picky, but a major part of a director's/writer's job is to research the setting and make it accurate and believable. Unfortunately, Jericho fails miserably in that regard."
2,Show gets progressively worse,"Some good actors, but each episode just got worse and worse as they only revealed miniscule pieces of info about the explosions. No wonder it got cancelled. No one can watch TV for so long and remain insterested or intrigued. Should have revealed the deal with the nukes in 2 or 3 episodes and then get on with the aftermath. I mean, that's what its about, isn't it? Spoiler: then to kill of April and her unborn baby so the cheating husband can mourn and eventually get with the bar owner, home wrecker? Come on! That's when I gave up on it. And it was over halfway through the season, so that gives a show plenty of time to make you like some characters. But to make the cheating husband sympathetic to 2 women? Nope. No more for me."
2,Farfetched,"Ok this show started off suspenseful. But as it gets further and further into the story, it just becomes ridiculous. Is this dude Jesus? He comes back from military school or wherever the hell he was, and suddenly he knows how to do EVERYTHING. In a city crisis like this, I don't think a random guy is just gonna take charge and fix everything. I mean if it was Macguyver, i could understand. I really did like it, but everything that was going on was just too hard for me to believe. This dude can practically walk on water, then u got some black dude in his basement creating some kinda time machine or something, who knows what hes doing. The idea of the show is respectful, but i think its a little too much. If the directors are reading this, just chill man, ur trying to do too much."
2,Wasn't as impressed...,"The concept of Jericho is interesting but contrary to what most people are writing, the charcters are mostly uninspiring and interact with each other somewhat unrealistically. This is a 90's style miniseries that should have been just that- a miniseries."
1,what was this garbage?,"I have no idea what this garbage was, and the real tradgey is that CBS kept it on as long as it did. Bleech."
2,Overrated / Waste of Money (The One Painfully Truthful Review),"Overrated: Currently averaging 4.86 stars. Half of the non-five-star reviews are a joke. Unfortunately, same goes for the five-star ones. Most fans of this show are blind zealots. Non-fans don't buy and don't rate this show--it is truly unremarkable. 2.5 stars, strictly for fascinating concept and wretched ability to sustain ""interest"" by stringing viewer along. To round downward is only fair.Waste of money: In a few more months they will tack on seven more episodes and release Jericho - The Complete Series. Does anybody really think there will be a third season? Let me know; vote below."
5,Right show for the times,"I must admit I was a bit slow to like this. As the season developed I really began to love this show, by the second half of the first season I couldn't wait for the next episode. The writers succeeded, and I bought into the characters, tension and action. It is interesting to wonder who dropped the bombs, and perhaps more interesting to see how survivors deal with the aftermath. What are the changes it all brings ?Although I had seen the shows, I bought this DVD because Jericho's production and acting is worth multiple viewings. The actors make you believe the characters -> you can sense they love their roles -> even the ones you hate. Some nuances you can pick up on second viewings. The production team has a fine sense of production, music, and story sense. The DVD shows this off with a great ""The Building of Jericho Feature"".I have only one complaint - why can't we get more HDTV on BluRay or HDDVD."
5,The best show you're not watching...,"I very rarely write reviews, but this show is like a breath of fresh air on prime-time - compared to all the reality garbage and CSI: Yet another spinoff - this show stands tall.So Why?Because it's intense and gripping drama in a nutshell. Superbly written, impeccably acted, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.To boot, the subject is obviously very disturbing and provokes you to think about human nature and how we all might act in the face of adversity.Two words - watch it!"
5,Don't Miss Out on This Series!,"Somehow in the midst of all the new shows last year, I missed out on what has become my all new favorite show - Jericho. The story line is an interesting concept: what would happen in your town if the country was attacked by nuclear bombs and the government and all normal resources were suspended? What unfolds is a story of small town Jericho and its inhabitants as they gather together to bring order and assistance to each other during a very dark time. Families are pulled together as marriages strained by circumstances unravel. There are heroes and villians galore and beautiful shots of the countryside. I have spent many a happy hour watching the story unfold. I cannot recommend it more highly. You won't regret it!"
5,Captivating,"There were things wrong with this movie. Whomever they chose as a medical laison failed miserably. One minute a patient is intubated, the next minute someone is doing mouth to mouth. What happened to the ET tube? One other negative is who the bad guys turned out to be. That said, it was addicting. I couldn't help but become involved with these characters, the fight between good and evil, small town America fighting back. I gave this 5 stars because it caught my attention right to the very end of season two. BTW, season two expands the focus from small town to country, and is just as good."
5,WOW,"When I first saw this show, I was deployed in Iraq. After that first episode, I could not wait until I had time to continue watching. If I was not on a mission or busy with my duties, I watched this show before bed. When I finally finished the first season, I was so anxious to find out what was going to happen next. I love this show and wish they would have done more than 2 seasons."
5,a Pleasant surprise,"i've had this one for a little while. I figured it was finally time to check out Jericho and see what the buzz was really all about. Even i've seen a preview or two of the show. It didnt really do it justice at all. I watched the whole series in 3 days time and it left me wanting more 22 episodes packed with all kinds of intrigue, sub plots with the different characters throughtout the show. It goes without saying that this is one of the shows to look out for in 2008. With tensions high between Jericho and the neighboring town of New Bern.Along with other things forming in this series it is evident that the show hasnt even begun to hit its stride. Great characters, well done stories and design make this something all should check sooner rather than later."
2,So annoyed that only the first episode was available to stream!,"The show was only okay. I recently watched ""Threads"" and sort of expected something similarly gritty. Watching this show was like looking at a J Crew catalog. The characters are pretty flat, but none of the houses were flattened. There was no blast after the mushroom cloud. And the characters were all parading around like they weren't the least bit worried about fall out. The looting and rioting took an unrealistic amount of time to get started. I'm not completely sold on this show. If I could stream the whole season I'd be able to find out if the show fleshes out more realistically, but now I might never know."
3,"not bad , but .....","Jericho was an attempt at embarrassing GW Bush ; that alone made it nearly FLOP . the apocalyptic theme is ok for the regular viewer . for science , hunters , mechanics radio types , it will leave you COLD ! .. forgot FARMERS !! i think they git the worstest treatment as far as ""REALITY"" is concerned . players as all pretty good . McRaney always does well .story line is consistent , but the props are sometimes BIZARRE . 3 get into an argument because a young woman says ""gas cant be transported in metal tanks !!"" well , just plain STUPID .the second season does wrap it all up in similar vane , but some twists only the emotionally handicapped mite , i say MITE believe .well its up to you . i call it a ""draw"" . you're not losing your money , but if looking for ""reality"" in your viewing , this isnt where to go .G'nite y'all"
2,not worth the money,"I think Jericho has some great actors. Unfortunately the story really isn't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed, and yet, more often than not, the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town, and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed, setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough. There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else. Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There's some nice twists from some of the main characters, but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything, and understanding what's going on can be a difficult enough task. Still, it's not a bad show, but it's not the best, and it's kind of overrated."
2,"Not done watching, but...After 7 episodes-","I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him, is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him, his brother is furious with him, his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody (actors, seem to have a clear line on who they're supposed to be).So far, after 7 episodes,for the first Season, I don't know who, or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store, just a stone beetch? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch?There is so much good TV. I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across. In my opinion, they had a dart board in their office, and threw darts at it, to see which ones stayed.I'm definately, not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program."
5,before its time,"if this show had come on in the last year or so, i feel confident it would have lasted more than one-and-a-half seasons. it was an excellent show."
5,a favorite,We love watching these old movies and TV shows. They make us smile and take us away from our daily stress.
5,Jericho season 1,Well written and performed. Although it took the cast about 2 or 3 programs to see the chemistry working. Well done very thought provoking.
5,"I'm one of the ""NUTS"" that saved Jericho!","Jericho is a wonderful show about a small town in Kansas trying to survive after a series of nuclear blasts have wiped out cities throughout the United States. The show sends a strong message, not only about survival, but about community and family values, hope and determination. The show was cancelled at the end of the first season due to a drop in the ratings that were solely the result of poor decisions on the part of the network and the fact that at the time, Nielsen didn't count internet or DVR watching in their ratings (that has now changed). The fans launched a massive campaign, in which we bombarded the network with phone calls, e-mails, and shipments of over 20 tons of peanuts (a reference to a story line in the season finale). The show has a stellar cast (Skeet Ulrich, Gerald McRaney, Pamela Reed and Lennie James, to name a few). I highly recommend this DVD and watch Season 2 in January on CBS!"
5,Jericho The First Season,My husband and I LOVED Jericho the First Season. It is an awesome show. It gives a really realistic look at what could happen if nuclear bombs go off. It has started many a discussion about what we would do at our house. It is very well written and very well acted. I highly recommend it!!!Sheri O.
4,Jericho fans will love it but season 2 will let you down,"Ok, this is a great series but season two jerks the rug out from under you. If only CSB would have completed the series for DVD."
5,The little show that could.,"Jericho is the little show that could! Viewers of all ages will enjoy this program. It is not at all your typical ""after the bomb"" doom and gloom show. It has great story line, great acting, and is actually quite uplifting in it's showing of how people are often at their best when confronted with a difficult situation. See for yourself what all the fans were fighting for."
5,Great show,"This is a great show. It deals with issues that came up after 9/11: how do we deal with attacks on the country. It's also refreshing to finally see something on tv besides CSI and American Idol. The acting is pretty good, and the story is very interesting. I actually like the second season more, but you should watch this before you get to it."
5,Jericho - The First Season,Can't wait for the second season to arrive in June. Would like to see the series continued on TV.
5,Nuclear holocaust in America,"Follow the lives of the survivors of a widespread nuclear attack after their mid-western U.S. town of Jericho is spared. Jericho has a novel captivating plot and is well acted. Season two ended in a way that encouraged viewers to hope for a third season in 2009. If you missed Jericho on T.V., buy or rent season one and you will get hooked. Then watch season two after it is released on DVD."
5,One season is NOT enough!,"Jericho was a show that I lost track of initially. I knew I liked the show, but it wasn't on a channel I normally watched, and the time changed. Eventually I found it again, thank goodness! I watched all the episodes online to catch up, and I was enthralled! I expected to feel despair watching a show of what comes next after the bombs go off. Instead I felt HOPE. Hope that the world will survive, inspiration that people can overcome huge tragedy.This show has all of the intrigue needed for an adrenaline filled show. It has the action to keep you entralled, and the storyline that flows - with characters that I want to see again and again. I am THRILLED that Jericho is coming back on air, and I hope to see it for years to come. This is a MUST SEE show, I recommend it to everyone!"
2,Illford Variabl Contrast Paper,The paper did not work well in my printer. It was meant for darkroom processing apparently and was not fit for my purpose.
1,Exploded my pipes,"I installed a Titan SRC-2 about 2 years ago. The thing never worked properly. It pulls so much amperage that my house lights flicker when we use hot water. It never would stay at a consistent temperature. Either too cold or way too hot. The company is impossible to deal with unless you are from Mexico or Spain. It blew out 2 elements and you have to buy them from the company not at any home improvement store. Finally one day we were filling our tub and the water was literally boiling, heard a lot of noise in the utility room then....explosion. It blew out the hot water line going to the tub under the house, flooded and had to have the line replaced. Do not buy these pieces of total crap. Spend a few more dollars and get a name brand, it will end up being cheaper in the long run."
2,mediocre product horrible service,"We purchased Titan heater a little over a year ago it worked ok most of the time even though we had to call technician a few times. Few days ago it broke and real problems stated. The manufacturer, Niagara Industries told us that the 10 year warranty only covers leaks ""if it just stop heating(!)what else it's for it is not covered, I agree to pay now they supposedly don't do service calls, you suppose to disassemble and bring/mail the unit to them yourself and then put it back on. Why the there are then certified installers when you buy the unit? We tried to call the original installer/distributor company, AVB to take care of the process, not for free(!) and I have never seen such a rude and obnoxious business. We end up hiring an independent electrician to take care of the disconnecting. Will see how the actual fixing will go. All the time our family with two small kids was without hot water."
1,Don't Do It!!,"ZERO stars.I have to concur with the POOR REVIEWS that these units get. When you call with a question about why your unit has failed, they tell you that you didn't hook it up electrically right, using a contact box or whatever.Questioning that, they say that they have had that posted on their website since [whenever covers their butts]. Why this 'special installation item' was not mentioned WITH the unit, or included with, or even OFFERED or SUGGESTED, is academic. They didn't know.Contacting the company is a pain, they seem like a fly-by-night outfit. Oh, and they want you to send $75.00 to have it serviced now. Mine is down there, but I'm abandoning the thing. Too bad, it's like new, it just doesn't work.JUNK."
1,"titan water heater, problems from two weeks on","titan n-180, stuck flow control valves, two filters before heater and water softener, proper instalation flow valves stick every two weeks, pop breaker inside unit , electrical problems with ckt board, warrantee, forget about it unless you live in florida next to the seller, big P>O>S"
2,"Good Price, Breaks every 12 Months.","Compared to other Tankless heaters this is a very good price. I have had this unit for 3 years, in 2 person home, 2 bathrooms. It does the job....mostly.However, right on schedule at 15 months (3 months out of warranty) it stops working. Did it again yesterday. Luckily I live in Miami where they are made. For $50 they will fix it, if I bring it to their offices. And they are good about it, no problem. Yes there is language problem, but the receptionist speaks good spanglish. I got a peak at their repair area...super super BUSY. Beware.Today we are going to buy another at home depot as a backup for when one fails. This is pretty outrageous...but we need hot water.If you don't live in South Florida I would not buy this unit knowing it will take a week for service time every year or so."
2,So so,"I have an n120 in a 1700 sq ft house in Tampa, fl. Biggest problem is maybe 15 % of my original water pressure. That and it takes a good ten minutes to get warm water to a back shower. The kitchen is the closet to the unit and does have endless, boiling water but again there's just no pressure. It's installed to manufacturers specs so that's not the issue. I'm thinking my only option is to get another unit with larger inputs/outputs and rewire it all. any ideas?"
2,Bought 2 both lasted 3 years,"Bought two of these for a 4900 sq ft house. Split the house, one for master bath and other bed rooms, other for kitchen and utility area. They worked well but only lasted about 3 years. Forget trying to get service from the factory, it is a joke. Located in Miami, if someone does answer the phone, you better speak Spanish. Building a new home now but i think I will go with a more reputable brand at a higher cost."
2,Slightly Erratic,"I've built and flown quite a few rockets in my time, but none have been as inconsistent as this one.Not sure if I was a little off alignment in attaching the small forward fins relative to the rear fins - it is possible.I only use C6-5 motors and had a couple of successful launches but also had a couple of might scary ones (the rocket turned & twisted right off the pad and came straight back towards the onlookers).I'd say there are better model rockets for your money."
3,Fast read. A bit light on details.,"Belarus starts off somewhat confusing as you're introduced to the plot, characters, and technology, but settles into a decent pace (I read the book in one day). At points you find yourself tempted to move slightly ahead of the text to skip the dull parts. The fantasy aspect is very light, but is slightly confusing. Overall, this book reminded me of a movie based on a book...just the significant highlights of the whole story...slightly disjointed. Several times you find yourself a bit lost and have to go back to re-read the last passages to figure out what has just happened. Overall a good book but slightly unsatisfying."
2,"Ols ""skool"" Kung Fu","Despite the poor reviews, I purchased this movie with an opened mind. This movie had the foot prints of a very promising old school ""kickers""!! I was especially impressed by the kung fu moves, which gave me a renewed respect for the monkey style. Despite the impressive training, especially the drunken monkey, I thought the final fight scene fell really short. It almost seemed like the director cut out a hugh chunk of the fight scene, and the movie ended! The expectation was set,,and I fell for it. I'm happy it only cost me $3.98 for this ""BUMBO-CLOTH"" flick!!"
2,I have seen better...,This was ok and probably just about worth $4.99. Decent fight scenes but as I said there are better kung-fu movies around.
2,Monkey Fist Floating Snake,"The plot for the most part was very boring. Fight scenes were pretty good, but it took a great deal of concentration to stay focused and seated to continue watching."
3,butchered classic...,"A fantastic revenge fight flick, great cheesy kung fu cinema.Unfortunately, they lost 95% of the final fight scene. One moment they are fighting, the next they are bloody and tattered, and the death blow is being delivered. Great set-up, huge let down ending.Worth the 3.98 version."
5,romance,Yolandita has a very beautiful voice she is a truly romantic artist I like all the songs that she sing.L
1,Just in case you think the G.E. name means quality,"I paid a little extra to get G.E. lights instead of a no-name brand thinking it would be less hassle. Only half the lights worked as delivered. I checked for loose connection, painstakingly replaced all the bulbs in the second half one at a time with the included spares and checked the fuses.G.E. support said I could ship it back and get a replacement in 6 to 8 weeks putting the replacement well within the new year."
2,Paid for 100; only half work...,"Purchased 2 strings of these lights over the less expensive types on the theory that the name GE meant something. Checked the string before putting it on the tree, they worked fine. Only after stringing them on the tree did the first half of the string fail to light. Checked every bulb -- none were loose, none were missing, yet the half remains dark. My recommendation is buy the cheapest ights you can find, none of them last anyway...."
1,Review of mini lights,I bought 4 packages of miniture lights. One of the four packages did not work. It would cost more to send back than to buy. Just a warning this product is faulty.
1,Cheap and barely work..not worth the price,I bought these because I needed lights in a hurry to cover for some burned out previous lights I had. What I got was a cheap set of cheap lights that half the string does not light and the wire is so cheap it feels flimsy and like it will break. These will not last past this year. Plus the price was outrageous. Go to your local Lowes and you can find a better set.
5,Visol Flask,My husband and I got this flask for his father for Christmas. It's a nice flask but not high-end leather. We had it engraved with his intials at a local jewelry store and really liked the finished product. We would definitely buy it again.
3,Leather Feels Fake,"This is an okay flask. The leather does not feel like leather, feels like hard plastic. Maybe that's because I am just more familiar with softer leather."
4,Great gift,"I got this for my dad as a gift, and had ""Dad"" engraved on it. The engraving was a tish off-center, but I notice those things. He loves it. It's very gentleman-ly and sophisticated. Great buy."
5,A must have on best Spanish architect,"A must-have massive volume (more than 700 pages, not 310 as told) comprissing Miralles' complete works (since he died in 2000). As in all El Croquis books you'll find a delightful presentation, and all works (more than 30-40 on this book) are deeply commented with photos, sections, elevations, plans, text... and interviews and articles by Alejandro Zaera (Foreign Office Arch.), Josep Quetglas (Catalonian urbanist), William Curtis... and Miralles' comments on his own work: pure poetry."
1,$7.95 for ONE BOX not Boxes as stated. Rip Off Price!,"I am very upset that I was charged double the normal price for 1 BOX of Sugar Twin. The advertisements says ""BOXES"" plural. I guess I made the assumption, based on price, that I would be getting 2 Boxes, not 1 BOX. I really believe I was cheated in this transaction."
5,brown sugar twin,"This is a great product, which I haven't been able to get in my local grocery stores for awhile. Was thrilled to see it on Amazon!"
3,Too Sweet,"I bought this thinking I could make peanut butter cookies with it like I did with the splenda brown sugar and sugar twin has no calories. The splenda is much better, this is too sweet to make them, I actually threw out the mixture. May be better as a topping or in another product that uses just a little, I will try some of sugar twins recipes."
4,Good Intro to Ponds,"This book was very helpful answering questions about pond and filter construction, pumps, fish, etc. He answers all of the basic questions and offers ideas and solutions to things you've never thought of if you are a beginner."
2,"Aargh, The steamer insert is not usable.","Until I find a steamer insert like those dim sum ones that fits this pot, this is just an egg boiler. The interior bottom discolored from one use."
1,"Difficult to Use, Poor Quality Sound","All the useful features of the Casio Phonemate TA-119 Answering Machine and Speakerphone prompted me to purchase it and try it out. While most of the features would normally be useful they are very difficult to use.Programming the machine with multiple greetings using the greeting file was a difficult task thanks to the poorly worded and often confusing instructions. Switching from one greeting to another is even much more difficult. Switching the greetings evolves several steps and its actually easier to just record a new one each time the greeting needs to be changed. Furthermore, the greetings sound quality is very poor.One could find many of the same features as in this machine without the useless greetings file for much less. I wouldn't recommend this answering machine for this reason."
4,chili pepper coasters,"They fit with the motif of my kitchen and work like good coasters should. The color has not faded, even though they have been sitting in the sun on my table. If you like the southwest theme, these are a good buy."
1,Very disapointed,"This item came in a small bag, its only like 5 inches long, and looked very CHEAP! I bought this for a birthday exchange gift and was very disapointed, so disapointed that I went and bought the little girl a couple more items to make up for it! I wouldnt buy this!"
5,Found this master on Pandora and ordered CD.,You will love this and can't go wrong with buying this CD collection. I stand in awe of people like Julian and their guitar skills. It is a pleasure to listen to this collection.
2,A biopgraphy for the followers.,"This book is a biography for the followers, what I got out of the book is that Acariya Mun was rather a arrogahnt man, looking down on others. A near God, with near super human powers, like abel to read other people thoughts, tame wild tigers, remote viewing, lecture other Buddhits abbots about how they should live there life. It seems that I did not much good things in his life other than beeing, and walking around in Thailand. I may very vwell be wrong, and for thar am am so sorry."
1,A black & white book for kids?,This review is for the Letters and Numbers For Me book.I would really like to know why the author or the editor picked this horrible layout.The world is not black & white and a child's journey through learning should be full of colors.
5,Retired SH Teacher,"This is an excellent approach for teaching special ed. students.For my moderate to severe students I had to adapt even more and repeat steps for awhile. It worked much better than ""tracing dots"" that was little more than busy work with little results."
2,Confusing! this method would definitely cause tears for my kids!,"I am so happy that I did not purchase this book and will have to agree with a previous poster. I was very excited when the OT at my children's preschool gave me copies of how to form the letters and said that she would give me lessons on how to teach this method to my children. After looking at the sheets I found them to be rather confusing for me (I don't understand why there were so many steps to form a lower case d for example) and with one child with needs and knowing her personality I knew this was not going to work for her at all. This method would surely cause tears for her. Unfortunately, this is the preferred method in the district.Right now we are working with a wipe off book in manuscript style and though its not perfect she is not frustrated and enjoys practicing all the letters on her own. I am leaning towards the Zaner-Bloser manuscript because this style seems to be closer to how I write and much simpler in method."
2,Boring,Too predictable!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wack!!!! He is not that funny and I feel he is better on the radio. I hope he continues to tell jokes when not in person because this dvd was lame.
2,What a waste of money!!,"I bought this DVD to support him since I listen to the Steve Harvey Morning Show. I thought it was going to be funny. His jokes are pretty average. He spend most of the time talking about politics and the Obamas which is like ""Been there, Heard That before"" It was just not funny. I thought he was going to do the gay guy like he does on the radio show. But he didn't. I was really disappointed."
3,Kind of Funny,"I was looking forward to laughing my butt off. But instead my laughter came in spurts!!! The movie had it's moments. I must say, I was kind of disappointed with Neohew Tommy's jokes"
1,Does not work with an induction range!,"This pot is a great idea in theory, but it does not work with an induction range! If only All-Clad made a pot like this with both the pasta and steamer basket in the USA at the quality level of their other products. All of my other stainless All Clad products work beautifully with an induction range. This product is the exception."
4,all-Clad not all American,The multi Cooker arrived promptly. The size was was perfect. I was disappointed that this All-Clad pan was not made in America like the first pan I ordered.
5,Serves the purpose,"Amazon had a 'lightning deal' on this and it's why I decided to get one, apart from the brand reputation, of course. I agree that the pot is not as thick as the other All-Clad pots and pans but I think it may be because it's meant to be just a water pot for the attachments. I don't know the technicality of it but I am pleased with it. I was able to cook a big batch of spaghetti sauce in the pot without any burning or the like. Recommended unless I guess you have more money to get the more expensive version that other people mentioned."
3,Don't be fooled!,"This is a good product, but not what I was expecting when I ordered it. Don't be fooled, this stockpot is not from the regular line of Stainless products by All-Clad. It's from a lesser-quality line of products. The walls are thinner and it just seems to be of less overall quality than the regular All-Clad products (which are fantastic in my opinion!) Mounted on the bottom of the pan is another piece of metal for conduction (totally unlike regular All-Clad, but just like Emerilware). For the price it is a good product, but if you want true All-Clad quality hold out for the more expensive version."
5,I research before I purchase.,"I'm always amazed at reviews that express shock or disappointment at the product. This is because Amazon does a great job with being clear and up front on items...especially all-clad.This item is a particular value. I found it to be as good as most of my all-clad collection, and having the same sturdy construction. Considering the lid, the pot, the two baskets, I regard this not simply as a quality item, but an exceptional value too.It may not be great for a lobster bake, but for soups, stock, pasta, shellfish like mussels or clams, shrimp...it is a hit. Best of all, there is no obligation to keep a product you don't like.I think this will be one of the pieces I use most frequently."
4,Better Than I Thought,I purchased this on a whim through my little gold box (back when it wasn't full of jewelry offers). It was a little larger than I had expected but this has turned out to be great. I make pasta and stock (chicken and beef) in it all the time. Nothing has ever burned on me using an electric or gas stove. I was a bit hesitant based on some of the reviews but honestly found this product very useful. I would not think twice about buying it again. I gave it one less star because the lid is a little unlike the quality of the rest of All-Clad's products but I usually don't cook on the lid.
1,Not Induction,"I bought this beleiving it was for induction cooking like it said. Open the box and placed it in my cabinet. Went to use it after 5 weeks and did not work on my induction cooktop.Now I understand it is to late to send it back, what do I do with it.I am trying to contact Amazon, to see if they would take this back being that they said it was induction and it is not."
2,"Nice pot, totally inaccurate description","It's a very nice pot, and well worth the price IF you don't have an induction cooktop. Although the description clearly states it's magnetic stainless, it's not. All of my cookware is All-Clad, and I love them, but they need to be a little more clear (or honest?) about this one.. it's not made by All-Clad, it's made in China, and it's not usable on an induction cooktop, unlike all their other stainless cookware."
3,Not induction compatible,"Despite what the description says, this cookware will not work with an induction cooktop. I was quite excited when the package arrived; the item appeared to be well built and was quite heavy. But when I placed a magnet to the bottom of the pot, it did not stick. It appears that Amazon has an incorrect discription of the item. All-clad is famous for their induction cookware, and one doesn't need a top of the line pot to boil water - but it does need to hold a magnet if it's going to work with an induction cooktop. I didn't know how many starts to rate this item. For a gas or conventional electric cooktop, I would give it at least four stars, but for induction, it is really zero stars."
3,Not Induction Compatible,I bought this item because it was rated as Induction compatible. It is not. At least I was able to return it.
2,Not induction compatible and half the quality as my legitimate all-clad,"It's an ok pot, but not high quality like all my other All-Clad stainless cookware. Sadly, it also does not work on an induction cooktop. This is the only piece of cookware that I have to replace after buying a new induction range. If you have a stainless set from All-clad, spend the extra $200 and get a 12qt stock pot that matches your set and stay away from this one."
2,I expected more,"I am disappointed in the pot. I got it for a wedding present. The first one I got had a dent where the pot meets the base. I can see how that could happen because the base is so much heavier than the whole pot. If it ever fell the cheap part of the pot would dent instantly. While this may be great buy with anyones name on it for $25, it isn't at over a hundred. It is made in China, feels like it is made in China. The stainless steel discolored the first time I used it getting that bluish tinge of cheap Chinese stainless steel. The inserts are a joke, they are thin stainless, and the steamer insert even worse. I would rather have a better built no-name one. I have about 10 All Clad pots now which I love. I also have quite a few Caphalon from years ago that are great too.I would not reccommend this pot."
1,Not for induction cook tops,I was so excited to find this stock pot and have been looking for a new one since I got an induction top. I was so disappointed that it won't work on my induction top. I guess my search continues....
1,BEWARE ~ not induction compatible.,"as with a few others, i bought this to go with my induction cook-top well over 1 1/2 years ago. today, i finally took it out of the box to use on the (finally!) installed cook-top, and find it does not work. i have been buying all-clad one piece at a time, preparing for this moment, so never re-read any reviews of the item. otherwise i might have been alerted to the issue with this pan. sadly, though it has been mentioned by several people, the description still indicates that it is magnetic stainless, induction compatible. so, i feel it needs more 1 star reviews to serve as an alert. other than this, if you have a conventional stove-top, it is a beautiful pot. sure wish i could use it. oops ~ gotta go help cook the spaghetti in several small pans now..."
2,complete waste,"I wanted to LOVE this pot. I don't. I actually hate it. It takes - I am not exaggerating - AN HOUR to boil a full pot of water. Now obviously, it's a big pot, it's going to take a long time. But an hour? I put this pot on my biggest burner (electric cooktop), on the highest setting, and 30 minutes later the pot is still cool enough to touch!! In many cases, a thick, heavy pot is ideal - it takes longer to heat up but it holds the heat better. But for a pot whose main purpose is to boil water? A thin pot that conducts heat quickly just makes more sense. This was SO not worth the money, or the space it takes up."
3,A Classic voice,I bought this DVD for the duet between Domingo and John Denver. He has a wonderful voice but I probably would not have bought his DVD if it didn't have John Denver as a duet with him.
4,Perhaps Love,"Not quite as great as I remembered but almost! Thanks for having this hard-to-find album. Placido sings ""contemporary"" love songs divinely!"
5,Leo's review on Perhaps Love,CD was delivered on time and intact. The sound quality is very good and worth the money spent.
4,I love it!,"The first three songs are great, the words, music, his voice. It was weird listening him singing in English but I didn't have hard time getting used to it. He is missing the 5th star because of the song 'Yesterday', I didn't like it. The rest is perfect. Best to listen with your girdlfriend at a special night."
2,weak...,"This book's just weird. I can handle centaurs and vampires, but a beast that is a product of a centaur and a human who are...ah...intimate with each other? The whole idea is just utterly gross, not to mention the distusting relationship with the young girl who is kidnapped at the beginning of the book.It's actually been about 2 years since I read this, but these are the only things that really stick out in my mind. The book as a whole is pretty marginal, it just seems like the guy put in every sci-fi and fantasy creature he had ever heard of and tried to blend them into one world. The story is somewhat convoluted and in the end I didn't care one way or another about any of the characters.This is pulp fiction at its weakest, in my opinion."
3,lackluster,"I think it would have been a different experience had I read this book when it came out-- but now, regardless of who came first, most of the ground in the book has been covered (and covered better, IMO) by other writers. Although Kahn deserves credit for making relations between the species realistic, his explanation of how we ended up with real creatures out of myth is strained and simplistic."
5,A Great Book in the Genre of Young Adult Thrillers,"I am a big fan of R.L. Stine and his novels. 'The Babysitter' was one of his best thrillers ever! It is about a young babysitter who discovers she is the next victim of a notorious babysitter attacker. The ending will shock you and leave you afraid to stay alone. A great, quick read."
5,I THINK IT'S COOL! SARAH B. HUGUENOT HIGH RICHMOND VA.,I ALWAYS LOVED HORROR BOOKS LIKE POE BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE IN MY TIM
4,Hey R.L. Great Job!,"Actually I have already reviewed this book and I am not doing another one. The book, ""The Bad Girl"" is absolutely excellent. Usually I can fortel the chapters and the endings to Stine's work but this book keeps you completely in suspense. Made me think; kept me reading and I finished it in an hour! Any book that keeps me that intrigued gets a worthy amount of stars from me. Good job R.L."
2,not so good,"Being a big fan fo R.L Stine I was disapointed that this book, didn't grab any of my attention. You mostly have to waite till the end to get to any good part. The end was fairly good, but not surprising. However It maybe a book to read on a rainy day."
4,Pretty good...not bad,"I thought the Babysitter was a good book, but I for one, already knew who the person was that was calling and threatening her.RL Stines books are good..I especially like the Fear Street books! NYSNC RULEZ!"
4,Very Good!,"Jenny accepts a baby-sitting job for a six-year-old boy named Donny. Jenny finds out that Donny's house is old and creepy and needs some work when she gets there. WWhen Donny is asleep Jenny gets wierd phones calls that says stuff like ""Are you alone? Don't worry copany's coming!"" And then a who calls himself Willers comes to the door. And Mr.Hagen,Donny's dad is always so wooried. There's a reason why he's so woried...A great book with a great ending that's impossable to guss!--Scott Schaeffer age 10"
3,Jenny was as innocent as a baby!,"Jenny just wanted to make some money, she thought nothing could go wrong babysitting. When she started , she did'ent know what she was getting into, but now it's to late to turn back!!"
5,Hey Babes!,"This is my favorite book of all time! Out of the 4 babysitter books, the 3rd one is the most shocking as in who the killer is. I really recommend it. I started the first one on friday, and throughout the weekend i read volumes 1 - 4just because I could not put down the books! I am NOT lying! Read thisbook and get thrills! Also, after your done with it, write a review!"
2,The Babysitter Review,"Jenny is being harrassed by threatening phone calls and letters. The phone calls and letters always happening when she is babysitting. She thinks it is her boyfriend Chuck. Who else could it be? I think this book was boring. And hardly any action at all. Nothing really exciting was ever happening, except when she got the phone calls. The ending is alright, it had the most suspense, hardly at that. The Babysitter, in my mind, is not a horror story and it didn't frighten me at all."
5,very scary and suspenful reading,"this was the very first book I had read by R.L. Stine about 6 years ago. I remember I couldn't stop pageturning with this story. The story is obviously about a babysitter who gets a new babysittersjob in town but there is a babysitter killer on the loose so she very frightened and then she gets scary phone calls. I can tell you that the killer came as a complete surprise to me. This book was so well written, like you are there yourself seeing the things that the babysitter sees. I totally recommend this book to everyone."
4,Work as expected,There is not much to go wrong with this item. I just wish it lasts more than the original one.
2,Broke withing seconds,The screw handle on the bottom broke off the very first time I put it on my camera.
4,Works Perfect With,It's exactly what is advertised and works perfectly with myManfrotto 725B Digi Tripod with Integrated Ball Head with Dove Tail Plate and Carrying Bag (Black). I keep the plate that came with the tripod on my Digital SLR camera and I keep the extra one I bought on my camcorder.
3,Manfrotto Bogen 3157N Quick Release Connect Plate,"Order this if you want an extra plate, as you get one with the tripod. This thing takes some getting used to. I seem to have a little trouble getting it lined up in the tripod clamp. That is the only reason for a lower rating. Could be me."
1,TOXIC,"There is an overbearing,eyewatering,toxic fume released from the materials used to make this bag."
5,Worth it,"This is not a cheap scanner, you already knew that. But I think it is worth the price if you have lots of paper you want to turn into ones and zeros. I had a few cardboard boxes full of paperback books that were taking up too much space, but I didn't want to throw them out. I cut off their bindings with a band saw and ran the pages through the FI-4120C and turned them into PDF files -- about 200 books, somewhere around 30,000 pages -- only cleaning out the paper dust every few books. I won't say it never jammed, but it jammed seldom enough to be highly productive, and it always had a good reason when it did, like residue binding adhesive. All the scans were excellent quality. I leave it set up on the computer desk because it doesn't take up much desk space. When bills or bank statements come in I scan them and throw away the paper instead of letting it pile up. A good, reliable commercial-quality document scanner, and rebuild kits are available for the rubber parts that wear out."
3,Mary,"The hanger was great, but I had to find my own screws to put it up. Just right for my log deck."
5,Just perfect!,I am very pleased with the quality of this deck hanger hook. It is very strong and easy to install.
2,Don't want to discourage...,"I don't want to discourage anyone from learning to love operatic singing, so if you love this CD, more power to you. I was mightily disappointed however. I am an opera ""faniac"" and of course a Leontyne Price admirer...but, here everything is wrong. The fact that it is ""bleeding chunks"" as one opera fan once described opera excerpts affected me more than I thought it would. The atmosphere just didn't establish The sonics were unappealing, but most of all the clincher for me was William Warfield's singing. He sounds threadbare in many places and his intonation was often cringe-worthy. I will never play this CD again."
5,un probiotico exelente,"es un probiotico que a aportado muchos beneficios a la salud de mi hijo lo seguire usando, tiene cepas necesarias para el buen funcionamineto de la flora intestinal"
4,Great monopod!,"Just got back from a beach trip with this thing. In years past, I had hauled along a heavy tripod, but this year I decided to buy one of these instead. I took several long exposure shots with no problem. The unit is very sturdy, works great on dirt, sand, or concrete. I do recommend getting the optional swivel head. And you might need to buy something to clip it onto a backpack, belt clip or what not (I just bought a climbing harness at REI).As an added bonus, this makes a great impromptu walking stick!"
4,solid,"This is my first monopod, and it's a pretty cool gadget. I prefer to use a tripod to steady my camera. but when it's not practical to do so, a monopod is a good alternative. This model is solid -- a little bigger in diameter than I thought it would be at the top, but it does inspire confidence. I use it with a ball head (you really need a good head of some kind)."
5,Nice monopod!,This monopod is awesome! Especially for the price! It holds our Canon Eos Mark 5 and is easy to move around and snap lots of shots. Screws right onto camera and is very sturdy. Folds up nicely and fits outside the camera case perfectly. No complaints!
4,"Excellent value, needs a design tweak for perfection","Per the other reviews, this is a fine buy for the money.The only minor caveat is that, unlike Manfrotto's tripods, there are no locking screws in the top platform. This isn't an issue if you're screwing the monopod directly into the camera/lens mount, but is if you're planning to mount a ball or tilt head on top. Without the locking screws only friction stops the head unscrewing."
5,a great carry around monopod,"Compact, light and ready to use any time. With 494RC2 ball head on top and Manfrotto 678, as base, a perfect support companion for a budding enthusiast who's always on the go. I gave Manfrotto a 5 for its design and quality over afford ability and practical use. I'm satisfied with my new gadget and i look forward to acquire more of Manfrotto's product."
5,"Good to steady camera, equally good for home defence.","So the ""Peacemaker"" arrived today.This is the first monopod i have ever bought. I was not sure what to expect.To say this is study would be an understatement. You could easily use this bad boy for home defence. Simply select the amount of ""reach"" you want with this snappy cugdel by extending the legs and you can wreak severe havok upon any unfortunate intruder who had the mistake of choosing your house. And after the carnage and chaos, you can use it to steady the camera to snap a few fun photo's of the aftermath.That aside, it is relativly light and straps to my flipside 200 pack with ease. The leg locks are strong and secure and you can tell this will hold some weight."
5,Look no further,"The best of the best. The 680B Monopod is sturdy, the correct weight and gives you the confidence that your camera is secure. The only option you may want to add would be a quick release option. However if not required, your search is over. Happy shooting"
5,Outstanding,One-thousand words are not enough to say the great things that can be said for this product & purchase. The Fender name is well served by both of these microphone & speaker stands. The microphone stands secure strong & solid for height as well as cantiliver length. The speaker stands also boast two sizes of dockings [just flip the inner pole over for the opposite size]. Variable speaker heights are achieved via the securing pin/s which penetrates the entire pole width. Fender; always outstanding products at favorable prices.
3,"Good, but not great","Much the same as others posted on this page I was not impressed with this book. It dragged-on and on, and just when I thought something really exciting was going to happen, revealing some vital piece of the puzzle, I was left disappointed.The characters were predictable Eddings types, but instead of being disappointed by this as others were, I found them reassuring and enjoyable.The book would have been better had it been 300 pages instead of 400 (a great deal left out might have helped the story move along faster) and if the characters had bonded together more. Not to put an emphasis on love, but in past books Eddings has used love to bring characters together; love of family, love of country and romantic love. The only thing that brought the characters in this book together was money and fear of annihilation.Still, I can't wait to read the next book."
3,A Major Disappointment,"I've been a fan of the Eddings for well over ten years now. I've read the Belgariad, the Mallorean, the Elenia and the Tamuli series, and loved them all (particularly the Mallorean.) I've even read 'Redemption' and loved it. However, I feel extremely let down by this latest work of the Eddings couple.While the writing style is very similar to that in most of the rest of their works, it lacks the energy, vitality, and fun that the others possessed. This leaves the book rather dull and lifeless to me.I'm glad I was able to find and read this book at the local library, instead of wasting $20 on it."
1,Atrocious. Enough said.,"Zero stars.Atrocious, simply awful drivel. It is very hard to believe, actually impossible to believe that this was written by the same author of the Belgariad series.don't bother, don't even waste your money if you can get it for $1.WHY? Boring, predictable, annoying, unbeliebable, repetitious. Stuff happens, characters spend 20 pages revising what just happened, more stuff happens (that you knew was going to happen) and the characters revise everything that has happened in the book so far. Repeat ad nauseum.Complete drivel. I hope David Eddings stops letting his wife write and flexes some of his imaginary muscle that worked so well in the past. I can't believe this got published..."
4,u all call urself eddings fan then bag out his book...,"How dare u people call ur selves eddings fans then bag out his latest book?!? Sure, it is not his greatest, but it is by eddings, and that counts for something. For goodness sake, it's a book one and setting up the storey for the next book.And enjoyable read for eddings fans, (if u dare call ur self that) and enjoyable read for those how are starting eddings, but this would not be the best book to start on. Sure, he repeats himself a little with storey line and all, but the characters are likeable and for goodness sake........IT'S BY EDDINGS WHICH MAKES IT A DAMN FINE BOOK!!!"
1,wow this was bad,"This is the worst I've read from Eddings. It was interesting enough that I read the whole series but I honestly regret that decision.The plot was shallow. The characters were shallow and repetitive. Most had no personality or, worse, identical personalities and mannerisms. Many scenes were repeated two or more times from different character's perspectives with only subtle differences. This could have been interesting but it played out as ridiculously boring filler instead.*spoiler alert*The series ends with something similar to the classic ""and then I woke up and it was all just a dream"". To me it was a final insult piled on top on a series that seemed focused on insulting my intelligence as best it could."
1,"If I could pick less than 1 star, I would.","This is the same old characters and story, without the writing skill. I threw the book away after 150 pages. Simply aweful! I am really dissapointed because I loved the Belgariad and the Mallorian."
3,Is this really Eddings?,"This was the first ""adult"" fantasy novel I read, and at that time, I think I enjoyed it and thought it was good. I was proven wrong when I started reading more fantasy, and really experienced good fantasy novels. Personally, this wasn't such a good book, Edding's style and all, and I have to say that his repeated jokes weren't that funny after a while.Books like Belgariad, Elenium, and even Mallorean (which is pretty good, but not as much as Belgariad-Belgariad is the original). the elder and younger gods switching their place every 1000 years or so was a new concept for me, but other than that, I can't say that this was such a good book.If you really want to know my opinion, this wasn't a horrible book, but I just read some better books. Follow my advice, and instead of Elder Gods, read some good fantasy like Belgariad, Elenium, Thomas Covenant, Wheel of Time, Inheritance, or maybe even Harry Potter."
1,waste,"The Belgariad and The Mallorean are some of my favorite books. The next series was okay. The characters did not change but the story was good. This series sucks on many levels. The witty banter is present but the characters are one dimensional and almost all the same. There is no plot to speak of. They all gather, set up a fort and a natural disaster (1 of four can you guess??earth, air, water, and fire) saves the day. They spend most of the time discussing how the bug people evolve over and over and over again. Okay I get it already!!! There was no intrigue, no trying to figure things out, no quests, no fear that they might lose or that any of the characters were in danger. In short these books had nothing interesting. I had to force my way through the first three books and I have no intention of reading the fourth as I'm pretty sure of what is going to happen and I can probably fill in the dialogue too. I feel totally ripped off."
1,What Happened?,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I devoured the Belgariad and the Mallorean (even the Tamuli), so when I saw that there was a new series out I got really excited and rushed out to buy the first. What a disappointment. There was none of the complexity of the previous worlds, and for ""gods"" these folks seems to have a pretty inconsistent level of knowledge/interest in their lands/people. I felt like I was reading dialogue of little children repeating conversations overheard from their parents (the parents in this case being Silk, and Barak, Polgara, etc.) I love the Eddings, and of course I'll buy the second, third, and fourth, despite this book, but I won't rush to put them at the top of my reading pile."
2,At last - a bad book by the Eddings',"I am a David (& Leigh) Eddings fan, having read just about all their work for about 20 years. But (relatively speaking) I found The Elder Gods......dull. The characters lack depth, and I had no emotional attachment to them. The fairly predictable storyline spends 80% preparing for battle - far too long. As usual the good guys fatality rate is far too low.Sadly, after so many books, the typical Eddings writing style is starting to become predictable and annoying. Instead of writing about a collection of people (mostly adults) with exceptional ability, I wish the Eddings' would include more vunerable, naive characters (e.g. a young Garion) - they can be so much fun."
2,Have to Agree ------ Major Letdown,I have been an Eddings fan since i read the Belgariad. After that i have read and re-read all his series and loved every one of them. I have to say however that this book was excruciatingly painful to read. The characters seem to be remakes from all his prior books and there is no ingenuity or energy in his writing. This is the ONLY time I willing put down one of his books and stopped reading in the middle. I hope that his upcoming books are able to salvage the mess this one has created.
1,Definitely NOT up to standard,"I've been a huge fan of David and Leigh Eddings for much longer than Leigh has even been acknowledged to have participated in their writing. I've read and re-read the Belgariad, Mallorean, Elenium and Tamuli series more times than I can remember, and they always capture my interest anew. They are among my most favorite books and I can get lost in them over and over.That being said, however, The Elder Gods; the first in a projected four book series is so lame and tiresome that I've had to put it away for good. I've tried several times to find something in it that sparks an interest in continuing, but it's just not there. I can not grasp the plot, nor can I find a character to even care about. This book goes on the shelf and I'll not be investing in the remaining three.I hope that the series concludes very soon, and that the Eddings can get back on track with the solid writing of their early series."
3,A Mediocre Book,"At first I had hoped that this was just a slow beginning. Sort of like ""Pawn of Prophecy"" where Eddings went slowly to draw out his characters. I am still hoping that this is true and his next three books go more in depth. I can imagine that this style of writing from different points of view would be hard, but if Dawn Cook can pull it off, so can Eddings. Mr. Eddings, please, please give the next books more depth! I did enjoy the ""voice"" of the story, though. Reading Eddings is like being told a story by an old, familiar friend!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I love the other Eddings' books, but this was terrible. It is boring and long. I forced my self to read about half of the book since I had spent money on the hard-cover edition, but it never got any better. The characters are not likeable."
1,Not very good,"I have read every Eddings book and this is not up to par. It is juvenile in plot and story line, very slow moving and boring. I will wait to buy book two to see if the reviews are the same."
1,Eddings ripped off his own book,"Sad sad sad. I was a huge fan of the Sparhawk series. In this book he seems to have ripped off his own characters from that series! The little dreamer girl is a copy of Flute ( who was cute in that series) but in this one is just down right annoying. All the other characters seem to mirror ones from his past books. Its dull, repetetive and boring to read, I admit I can't even finish this one. I just skipped to the back half way through. I don't think I will buy the rest of this series when it does come out. Save your money and just read the Sparhawk series."
1,Drivel,"I never thought I'd say this about any piece of work by Eddings, but The Elder Gods put me to sleep. This would have been fine if I was in bed at the time, but I was down at the local swimming center, thinking to catch up on some reading while my daughter and friends played. How embarrassing when my head started nodding!Honestly, the only thing more boring than this would be a tutorial on PHP. The writing style was annoying, Eddings started far too many paragraphs with ""Now"" which made me want to scratch my own eyes out... All in all it was incredibly disappointing. Pfft. Understatement."
2,"Not bad, but not great either!!!!!!","Like many other readers, it is not the best the Eddings can do....I so much enjoyed the previous series, I really hope, that this one will not leave me wanting.The general idea is good and has potencial. So Eddings go with it, and do your Eddings thing."
1,"Eddings, you owe me 2 hours of my life back!","I have read every book the Eddings' have ever written besides ""The Redemption of Athalus(sp?)"" - I couldn't keep reading after a couple hours. I grew up on this stuff and that is why the ""trend-of-similarities"" that actually developed with the two Sparhawk series infuriates me. Every reader has biased expectations, that is to be expected - the Belgariad and even the Mallorean were very good. But its obviously not just me, everone seems to realize that all of these characters have been created on some quickie assembly line.I just want to ask the Eddings' a few questions: Why do your characters all act and sound the same in every book? Why is there always that same magic jewel? Why do all your characters have the same annoying speeches and retorts going back to the original series? Why Gods in every book? You should start writing only for Harry Potter fans - if they can stand something so patronizing and childish."
1,a sad disappointment for a big fan,"What a sad day, I never thought I would give anything by David Eddings such a low rating. I love his previous series and even ""Redemption"", but this was not what I have come to expect from a beloved author.This novel was dull and repetitive and the characters were a little too obvious. Not what I was expecting and quite a disappointment."
2,predictable and repetative,I picked this book up on the bargin table at a local book store. I have always enjoyed Eddings work but this book falls far short of his previous series. The characters and plot are predictable. There are no twists or surprises. The book seems to drag on and on with details being repeated sometimes three and four times. I fell asleep often while reading this book but did manage to get through it.I only recommend it if you have nothing better to do and are a die hard Eddings fan.
3,dissapointed,"i love david eddings. i own all his books, but this one was dissapointing. i could not get into it much less finish it. i hope he recaptures his earlier magic with the third book."
1,disappointing,"The Eddings have always been likeable for their commentry on the human condition via the use of archetypal characters that represent one type of person (ie, Tolnedrans are materialistic, Angaraks are religiously fanatic etc) What this book fails to do is to come up with characters that are original to Eddings' work! For example, Longbow is strongly reminisent of Hettar, Rabbit of Silk, Eleria of Flute, etc etc etc.Coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. The story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase I kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.This book offers nothing that earlier Eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. The style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.Save yourself some time and money: avoid this book."
1,"Tired, worn-out concept","It is regrettable that David and Leigh Eddings, authors of the remarkable ""Belgariad"" and ""Mallorean"" series, have chosen to ride the diminishing wave of this creative concept for so long. What was brilliant, witty and vastly entertaining for the first 10 books was still usable for the 2-part, 6 book series that began with ""The Diamond Throne."" It was passable for the stand-alone ""The Redemption of Althalus."" By the time we reach a *fourth* series using the same, barely disguised characters, concepts, and plot line, it is obvious to a dissapointed reader that the authors are just phoning in their performance. This type of copy-cat writing does more to anger long-time fans than it does to spark new enthusiasm for the authors' offerings.If you enjoyed any of the previous Eddings' works, do yourself a favor: go re-read the books you already own and save yourself the waste of twenty-odd dollars."
1,Didn't Think it could get worse after Athalas Book,"David Eddings has sunk even further. I really enjoyed reading the belgariad and Mallorean as well as the two Sparhawk series. I have been waiting for him to release another good series. This one is not it. The characters are bland, the story line is restated over and over. There are even chapters that have actually no point and should not have been included. You know nothing of the bad guy, the heros sail to an unknown land for ""promised"" gold to fight a war. How convient that a couple of 100,000 people will just go fight a war for an unkown people in an unknown land for ""promised"" money. This is just sad and the good guys easily get out of every bad situation way to easily. What is the problem is you can just ""dream"" your way out of it. Please David.... get good again."
2,Disappointing,I have been a huge fan of David Eddings for over 10 years and was really looking forward to his latest book. What a let down after the fantastic earlier series! If you haven't read David Eddings before - skip this one and read all of his old books!
1,Dreadful,"I was so disappointed in this book. I have reread the Belgariad and Mallorean series more than once and enjoyed the style and humor of the books. However, this series seems to me like the Eddings are just capitalizing on their name. The writing style is annoying and the plot juvenile. Don't waste your time."
2,"Slow moving, lacks drama","I have enjoyed many other books by David Eddings, so grabbing the first three books of this series seemed like a wise decision. Alas, past performance does not guarantee future success.The intial focal point of 'evil' in this series is called the Vlagh. Sadly, the Vlagh never sparked any emotions in me. Neither did the good guys. The battles, if you want to call them that were ho hum. The storyline provides not tension what-so-ever. There's nothing to engage you.I will say that the Elder Gods at least left me with enough interest to read book 2 in the series, so I gave it a 2."
1,No inovation,"I found the book to be, boring uncompelling and superficial. I just finished the elenium and the tamuli before getting into this one. Those where already deeply dissapointing but this.... Truth be told Eddings does not know how to burry a character... For those who've read both elenium and tamuli it is fairly obvious that the little eleria is the godess aphrael all over again, down to the little kisses. The depth of the characters is stunningly superficial not to mention boring. As was said in a former review, the most irritating feature in this book is most certainly the repetition of things explained and explained again. I struggle myself through this series because I bought it and because quite frankly at this point I haven't got any other to read... but for those who haven't bought it yet, it's a waste of money and time if you are looking for the finly tuned characters and plots of the belgariad and the mallorean... I hope you find your writer's strenght again david"
3,Same old same old,"My wife picked this book up for me and I just finished it. While I enjoyed his original works, you really start to see a pattern in his writing. I found this book to be quite formulaic. Essentially I just found myself surrounded by the same old characters in some fashion or another. To me The Belgariad was a great read, but everything else is just hammered out from that mold. So same old same old. It was a decent book but I would not recommend it. Your just reliving the other series he has written. You can even see his formula on the Wikipedia entry for David Eddings. :)"
2,Don't have any big expectations,I have been an Eddings fan for a long time. The Belgariad and Mallorean series have been my favorties since i first read them about 10 years ago. I was sorely disappointed when I began reading this series when it first came out. Basically the characteristics from older characters have been moved around and given new names. If you like predictability you might like these books. I own the first three books of this series but I haven't even finished the second one and doubt that I will anytime soon.
3,Vaguely annoyed,"I'm not quite sure why but this book vaguely annoyed me. It just didn't quite seem to click with me, the characters were just too ""Oh, ok, then I'll go off and do that."" The concept is interesting but the actual read isn't that great. And yes, normally I'm a fairly big David Eddings fan."
2,Disappointing Series,"The idea was good and the characters interesting but it read like it hadn't been edited. Telling the same story from different character perspectives, down to the same exact dialogue, was tedious. I read it because I've read all his work, but couldn't wait for this one to end."
5,I can't wait for the next one!,"This is the beginning of the new series by David and Leigh Eddings and it is not bad. I saw some negative reviews, but they are misleading, after all, this is just the first book and the next one will be better for sure.I enjoyed it pretty much, even if I find other recently published books as ""Eragon"" and ""Jarka Ruus"" better."
1,Small story repeated over and over and over and over,"This is the first book i have read by this author and it frustrated me enough to write this. (Deep breath) The characters are too simple and are poorly developed. They all think, talk and act same regardless of whether they are a pirate or a god. Events that happen in this book are retold by the characters over and over. It is enough to say ""Rabbit told Red-Beard about the harrowing night time fight aboard the ship."" We don't need a play-by-play description of what we just read 3 pages ago. What is worse is that these events were not all that impressive to begin with. Nearly everything turns out as the character expects and when it doesn't turn out just as the character expects, it is all solved rather easily anyways. I realise that i myself couldn't have done any better and that i'm just ranting but how could someone who has sooo many books write sooooo poorly.Chris"
2,Disappointing,"As a huge fan of the Belgeriad (and a lesser fan of the Mallorean--too much of a rip off of the first series), it pains me to write this review. But it certainly seems like the author was tired of writing this stuff or had become cynical and knew that his fans would read anything he wrote.The entire Dreamers series seems quickly written, sparse, minimally editted and without much purpose for its existance. The dialog is stilted to the point of humor. Maybe the author was attempting an affectation that I somehow missed. But the 'gods', who are the main charcters are incredibly pretentious and dull.Why two stars, you might ask? I gave the second star out of respect for his prior works. I felt that if I did less, Belgarath and Polgara may be watching."
2,Not your typical Eddings,I have been a huge fan of David Eddings for over 25 years. I have read all of his other books so many times I have lost track. They are books that I can read over and over.I am only about half way through this book and I am growing really disappointed. Something is off and I am having my doubts that David was all that involved with writing this book. What is really frustrating is it seems to me like there is a lot of similarities pulled from his other books. It seems to me Eleria is a lot like Aphrael from The Elenium and The Tamuli.I will finish this book and after I am done I may decide to give it a better rating but so far it not near the quality of previous books by this author.
1,Writen only by David Eddings,"This series was actually only written by David Eddings, though Leigh Eddings name is listed. David started it after Leigh had taken ill, and she had very little input in the writing of this series at all.David himself was not a very good author, his wife having helped write all the other novels. She was the one whom created the main characters for The Belgariad series, plus all the following series. She was the real creative mind behind the stories."
2,"Don't buy this book, get the Belgariad instead.","If you haven't read David Eddings, read the BelgariadThe Belgariad, Vol. 1 (Books 1-3)andThe Belgariad, Vol. 2 (Books 4 & 5). They are excellent. If you read those and liked them, please please don't start this series. It looks like someone else took a fairly interesting 1-page outline and padded it to 400 pages. It's not the worst book I ever read: That would be volume 2 of this same series, which is worse. Whole paragraphs are cut and pasted. I recycled these books rather than put them on the bookshelf at work for somebody else to read. Supposedly volumes 3 and 4 are worse still, but I'm not planning to find out."
5,Charming,"Very well-written book. I have never read Edding before, but definetly will read his other stories. This is excellent. Love it! It has nice characters, big bad villain, magic... only the works of Mr. Robert Stanek are better."
2,Would be better if he hadn't written this 12 times already,"There is quite a bit to like about this book...if you haven't read his other books first. Longbow, Red-Beard, and Rabbit are all excellent characters. The way the Gods transport themselves over long distances is kinda cool, andAll of his female characters...Belgariad, Mallorean, Elenium, Tamuli, and now the Dreamers are the exact same. His theme about all things being cyclical is wearing thin. He also seems to be losing his knack for writing good dialogue. Almost all of his characters talk in the same folksy way. I don't know anything about why he's with Aspect instead of Del Rey now, but I'd say this book isn't up to Del Rey standards."
1,Last book is a nightmare,"Don't buy it, except perhaps to send back to the publishers for a refund like I did after reading it. I was never so dissapointed in my life, the ending of the book and the series was a slap in the face to all loyal fans."
1,1 Star only because I did not have the option to go lower!!,"I was a huge Eddings fan until I read this book. The characters are uninspired and boring. It was like reading something from a Jr. High student. If this is the best of what Eddings has left in him, then I suggest that he take up a new career. In other words I do not recommend this book. Read some of his earlier writings. Those you will enjoy."
2,"Oh Look, Colored Rocks","After 17+ books, he's still doing the exact same thing and much worse than usual. I love the Eddings' writings. I put up with four series of blue and red rocks in two different worlds because they were excellent in writing even if the plot and characters resembled each other. But don't go for this series, just don't. Pick any of his other ones and you'll love them. But not this series."
1,"Disappointed, entirely","I have been a huge David Eddings fan from the Elenium, Belgariad, Malloreon, The Redemption of Althalus and was looking forward to a new series from him. So it was with excitement that I picked up this book.I couldn't even finish it, I felt like I was reading written by a 13 year old from the pink dolphins to the pet lightning, ugh! I was bored almost to the point of dying from it. I was heartbroken too, David Eddings was a beacon of light in the fantasy genre, I loved Sparhawk from the opening paragraph of Diamond Throne through to the end, and Silk and all of the rest from those storylines, and Althalus. But this, this is too much and he will be needing to redeem himself if I am to be a reader again. I was sorely disappointed."
1,Really...just not good,"Like many, I have enjoyed Eddings series in the past. I have read and re-read all of his books. So I figured I would pick this one up and it should entertaining at the very least. How wrong I was. Simply put, this book was so poorly written that I struggled to finish it. And no, I won't be continuing the series. The characters were poorly fashioned and nothing seems to go wrong for the ""good guys."" They hardly describe who the enemy is, just telling the reader that they are evil and insect like. One of the things that was my biggest pet peeve was that the characters kept repeating the same story over and over. It's like they ran out of things to write about! This book was one of the worst fantasy books I have ever read and I hope to God this isn't what is in store for all the Eddings lovers out there in the future."
5,one of the most unsung r&b artist of our time,"""Square One"" is one of those types of albums that you can put in and let play and let the music and lyrics take over. I am a big G.T. fan and I am also dissapointed with the lack of publicity and coverage this multitalented artist receives. ---This album is a ""must have"" for true soul/R&B fans"
2,"tedious,music -by-numbers ,uninspirational dissappointment",Having been a big fan of Gary's i must say i was more than a little dissappointed at this latest offering.Come on Gary let's have more albums like love dance and moods of midnight .I know you can do it!!
1,Great Toy!!! Fun from begining to end!!! Cute and Adorabe!!!,"This is the cutest most adorable toy i have purchased. It goes forward and turns around and barfs like a real puppy!!!!! It is small, and well build, i cant stop playing with this wonderful puppy!!!"
1,Avoid this set of tapes,"DO NOT BUY this set of tapes. These five tapes (10 lessons) are the first five tapes of the 15 tape (30 lessons) language course, volume one. You may find use in the Pimsleur method--listening to and repeating after native speakers and translating from English--but you will not learn enough useful Portuguese from this five tape set. Moreover, these tapes will not adequately prepare you for volume two of the course. If you want a lower cost introduction to this method, buy the Pimsleur Portuguese Basic Course. It has four instead of five tapes, but costs almost 1/4th as much. Otherwise, bite the bullet and purchase the full volume one, costing $250-$300."
5,"Medium 1, 2 & 3",Great video set. No issues with product. It was backed ordered so took a little longer to get than expected.
5,What can I say?,"Schindler’s List is more than your everyday Nazi film. I’ve seen it about 10 times and every time I see something new in it. Always cry at the last scene. I’ve even saw it dubbed in German where the lines are altered, not interpreted, making it a different movie.Freaky resemblance Fiennes and Neeson have to there actual characters.I recommend ""Inheritance"", Amon Goeth's daughter Monika Goeth Hertwig documentary for deeper insight."
4,Super funnel?,I always wanted to post a review with a question mark and now that I've done it I need to find a new life-goal.I like this funnel.I use it to put gas in my cars.It is wide enough and deep enough that gasoline does not spill from it and it is thin enough at the end to allow it to stand up int he gas filling hole thingy.I used to labor with a gas can that had a plastic spout that dripped. It was slow. Now I just pour the gas can into the funnel and voila! The gas descends into the bowels of my automobile like... I guess this is where metaphor completely abandons me.
5,The Didge... A++++++++++++++++++,This didgeridoo is soooo beyond cool!!! A great product and a fantastic store to do business with!!!!
5,Really Lively,"Just love the title track. It's like spiritual disco :-)Well, think about it. We all wanna/need to dance but how often do we get to do that to lyrics that are positive?One With The World would make an awesome club song.Get workin' on that remix!The other songs are great too - David's a really cool singer."
3,"Great recipes, organized a little funny","I love Cooking Light and I subscribe to the magazine, so liking the food in the cookbook was not the question. I was a little surprised how it was organized though. I prefer cookbooks to be organized in a per type of recipe fashion (i.e. separated by cookies, meats, side dishes, appetizers, etc.). Instead, they organized by different menus. Yes, the tips were handy, but hard to find if you are looking for a cookie recipe and need a tip on cookies, for example. I had to go through page by page (and eventually, just turned to the index) to find all of the dessert recipes. *sigh* They could have made this a lot more convenient."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this personal PA system to use for performing Wedding Ceremonies. It worked ok the first time I used it but was not totally clear. The second time I used it for a wedding it did not work very well at all, it cut out in the first two miutes and would not work even after being turned on and off. It had been fully charged and the directions were followed to the letter. It was embarassing and very disappointing, it never has worked properly. Unfortunately it was past the return time for Amazon and I was never able to get a response from Fender. Save your money, it was a big waste of mine."
5,Good Unit,I use this for car sound with an iPod because the FM system to beam to a car radio are very noisy. Also playing a keyboard for homeless services in town. This unit is good with voice and music. The line input is not given a volume control and it is very HOT so keep the volume in low or use an attenuator.
5,Great portable PA,Purchased for a 4H group. It is used at livestock shows etc. It works great and holds a charge for a long time.
1,Disappointment,"Item received was defective and none more available, company was very prompt in issuing refund"
1,Dont Buy It,"If i was to say this movie was bad, think again, it was a good plot but bad acting, all you have to do is watch 2 lines and you turn it off, i own the video version, thats worst than Carry On follow that camel, what was the point on watching this.DONT BUY IT!!!"
3,"Ok, I guess","This is another movie that I bought for my uncle, so I am not sure how good/bad the movie is."
1,Poor quality rip-off!,"While ""Clambake"" was certainly not at the top of the heap of Elvis fun-in-the-sun movies, the least they could have done was do a competent job with the mastering of this disk. The quality, while not the worst I've seen, is below average and there are flaws galore, most noticeably at about 48:40 where the picture is so wavy that appears like it was shot underwater until a thick white line washes across the screen from botton to top and resolves the image. Does no one even view these things before the discs are pressed and sold? What a rip-off!!"
5,Swinging at a Clambake!,"""Clambake"" was a film that Elvis had total disinterest in doing. Actually, this film is fun to watch and every Elvis fan should take the time to watch it. Probably the only reason was that the ever-lasting chain of musical comedies was getting tiresome and old. Bill Bixby is Elvis' rival. Elvis delivers him with a sucker punch and Bixby is out cold. Elvis is an unhappy-with-money millionaire's son who switches places with Will Hutchins, a poor water-skiing instructor. Elvis takes interest in third-time Elvis costar Shelley Fabares. If you want to see a zany Elvis picture, this is the one."
2,Clambake,"This movie was made in his later years, it was not as much fun to watch, as the earlier movies, the musical numbers were not that good."
2,Shame!,"Being a low price DVD, you do not really expect much, unfortunately though this really goes too far resulting in the VHS version being far better quality. I expect the powers that be thought this film is only aimed at hardcore Elvis fans and corners were cut, this would be the same thought process that managed to produce these calibre of films to start with. I am also surprised that some of the other films in MGM's vaults were not released first, examples being ""It Happened At The Worlds Fair"" and ""Live A little Love A little"", especially with the worldwide success of "" A Little Less Conversation""."
2,Floridians beware,"I've enjoyed some of Elvis' movies like Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, and Fun in Acapulco. I received Clambake as a gift to add to my collection, and I thought I'd like it especially because it took place in Miami, where I'm from.Sadly, this was not a very good movie. The late-60s styles were comical, and the young days of ""Christine"" from ""Coach"" and Bill Bixby from ""The Hulk"" were amusing. However, the obvious closed sets, corny acting and oddball music interludes kept me asking why was this movie even produced.The final insult to injury... Elvis and his girl drive into the Florida sunset... with mountains in the background!?? The only mountains in Miami are trash dumps so this was obviously shot in California and poorly passed off as Miami Beach.So I give it 2 stars: one for Elvis and one for the real Florida."
2,Purely for Elvis fans...,"Not one of Elvis's best movies, but it has some good songs in it and parts of the storyline are not too bad. I felt this DVD was not compressed too well, the picture is fuzzy in parts and there are original old-Reel markings in some scenes. The sound is OK but overall it should have been much better quality considering DVD is suppose to be better than VHS.- I would wait for a second release. Thanks."
2,Beach Blanket Elvis,"Despite a ridiculous title, cheesy rear projection and mostly forgettable songs, ""Clambake"" (1967) proves an OK beach-blanket variation of ""The Prince and the Pauper."" Elvis Presley overcomes his artistic frustration with a likable performance and two solid ballads - ""You Don't Know Me"" and ""The Girl I Never Loved."" Not the weakest Elvis movie by any means, but the original title would have fared better: ""Too Big for Texas."""
3,OK - So it's not one of Elvis's best films...,"...and I thought the quality was on the poor side for DVD format...it DOES feature ELVIS in about every scene...and if you are a ""die-hard ELVIS FAN"" like myself - you have the honor of simply watching this beautiful man, and in some pretty snazzy duds for the time I might add, through the duration of the movie.Most of all, if you don't get it for any other reason, this is the only opportunity to experience the unforgetable, breath-taking scene of ELVIS singing ""The Girl I Never Loved"" - a truly beautiful love song (1 of his best,IMO)amidst a paradise at sunset background. (sigh...sniff...) I have looked elsewhere, trying to find this song to no avail."
4,The greatest boating film ever,"Filled with fascinating homages to the writing of Patricia Highsmith, Clambake also offers Elvis is two of his finest roles backed ably by Shelly Fabares and stalwart Bill Bixby. And, naturally, some of the finest boating ever to be seen on screen.Not to mention the boss title track."
5,Clambake,"Gotta love Elvis. Shelley Fabares is one of his better co stars. Fun movie!! Compares favourably with Girl Happy, GI Blues and Viva Las Vegas."
1,The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.,"The case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I liked the movie."
5,Cut me some slack please,"Great product, good firm connections at both ends... Works good to really rock out while playing Guitar Hero II."
4,PS2,This really came in very handy when we had the ps2 for long reaches across the room so we could sit back and watch movies.
1,didn't even work,"I plugged in, and the light went on for the controller, but it didn't work. Super disappointed..... I wouldn't recommend this..."
5,PS2 Controller Extension Cord,"Have you ever been sitting in bad, nice and warm, but your controller cord length kept you in an uncomfortable position? After purchasing this 6 extra feet of cord, I no longer had this problem! A must have! A+!"
5,No more slip for XS1100!,"My 1981 Yamaha XS1100 started sipping under load at WOT in 3rd-4th gear. Since steels and friction discs don't generally go bad on these bikes, I decided to throw a set of these coil on it. Problems solved! Hooks up like a dream now, seems like it ""gained"" me a lot of wasted power I lost while it was slipping.Was a 45 minute job on my XS! No worries."
4,My boss needs to read this,"Great suggestions and information. As said in my title, my boss needs to read this."
4,A decent controller,"Played many hours of RPGs on this controller. The X button finally gave way after countless hours of gameplay and use. Controller is well built and strudy. A little large, but better for larger hands. Turbo functions come in handle to scroll past text already read. Not a bad controller to get."
1,Controller has a mind of its own.,This controller develops a memory of its own. During gameplay it will press buttons for you that you are not programmed. Even when you clear the memory it still presses undesired buttons. This is especially frustrating when in difficult levels without save points. On two ocassions it made my Playstaion 2 crash.
1,BIG mixup,WLF i did not get what i wanted they sent me a controller for XBOX 360 not the PS2 turbo shock 2 controller.
3,Good Buy!,Not a bad product considering the cost. So far I have had no problems with this controller. I would be willing to purchase other things from its manufacturer.
5,Short Life Span,"I loved this product when I first got it. I used it daily and loved the freedom. But shortly after my dear daughter spilled nail polish remover all over it and it has since died. I would definately recommend this product, it is great. Just keep it away from liquids."
1,Sony Playstation 2 Turbo Shock 2 Pad Black,"This was a complete waste of money. It is junk and broke on me the first day. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PS2 Controller, buy the WiFi Logitech one instead."
4,Good introduction to urban planning theory,The book is a very good syntesis to urban planning theory (specially in ths U.K.). I recomend it for a textbook.
2,"Beautiful, but...","This is a beautiful book, with lovely kaleidoscopes for inspiration. However, I am looking for a VERY beginning book for someone who knows absolutely nothing. This book isn't it. Nice to look at, though."
5,The Ginger bread Kingdom,"I thought the book was amazing. It's full of fairies, magic,and other magical stuff. I think it was the best book I have ever read. I really think you should read this book."
1,Fake Versace,"This product was not original, or as a best case scenario, a versace Rosenthal reject that should never make a store shelf. The print was fuzzy, and the finish poor. I was shocked that I could receive something like this from amazon.com, not from a seller but the website's own sales operation."
1,DO NOT EVER BUY THIS!!!!!,"This is the crappiest product I have ever bought. I had problems at the outset, I contacted the manufacturer and they said it was 'my fault, I wasn't using it right'. Excuse me? because I opened wine incorrectly. (Say What?) They sent me a replacement screw but it made no difference.After opening about 50 bottles (mostly painfully) it finally broke altogether. Useless plastic junk. DO NOT BUY! Useless garbage..."
1,Not made in America,This item was shown on Made in America web site as American made but is made in China Now they trick into buying junk from China costing American jobs SHAME ON THEM
1,Broke after 1 month,"I bought the ""Pink"" version of Metokane rabbit and the handle broke in half after very few uses. The metal inside the handle is only half-way through the handle; therefore, the plastic end you lean on broke off. VERY shabby product."
3,"PLASTIC ""STUFF"" BREAKS ALL TOO SOON","I purchased the red rabbit about 1 year ago. It worked fine, but I had trouble with removal of synthetic corks. So, last night, opening a bottle with a synthetic cork, it broke when I reversed the direction & started removing the screw from the cork. The plastic handle broke completely off & the inside plastic surround looked damaged. The whole tool just looked compromised in all the PLASTIC areas. Just remember folks....THESE ARE PLASTIC & PLASTIC BECOMES BRITTLE AS IT AGES!! I will be shopping for an all steel wine opener now."
1,"AVOID, fragile and terrible customer services","Length:: 0:44 MinsDon't buy. Metrokane have cool designs but products are expensive and won't last long. Customer service is terrible, per say NONE. Try to contact Camille in title to be responsible and no feedback. I've sent my broke unit and never saw a new one again. AVOID AVOID AVOID. I don't know how big retailers buy from this Company."
4,Rabbit Corkscrew,"I bought this corkscrew about two months ago after a similar one fron Sharper Image broke. The Rabbit corkscrew works very well; better than the previous Sharper Image version. My big complaint is the stand/base for the unit. First you must remove the corkscrew from the stand and set it down in order to get to the foil cutter which is located under the corkscrew in the stand. My other complaint is the unattractiveness of it(the stand). It is black plastic with large white lettering proclaiming it as the ""Original Rabitt"" and other propaganda. I do not appreciate having this sitting on my bar."
2,Horrible Customer Service,We have gone through two Metrokane Rabbits. After the second one BROKE we sent it in per the instructions for the ten year guarantee. It was returned after THREE MONTHS. This is not acceptable customer service!! Buy a different brand!!!!
1,Beware of this fancy corkscrew,"Metrokane Rabbit Corkscrew, BlackWhat an expensive rip off. Works great for about 25 bottles, then its time to replace the supplied worm screw, after that loses its teflon coating you go to the Metrokane web site and find a replacement for $10 plus shipping and if your lucky you may get a replacement in two or three weeks. Don't bother with an email to their customer service, as it obviously does not exist, no answer to questions. Stick with the $20 knock offs. Very disappointed in this company and its product."
1,5 Stars for Amazon.com and 1 Star for the Metrokane Rabbit,"We purchased this corkscrew as a gift for our daughter. On her first attempt to use it at a holiday dinner party, we found that it required an unreasonable amount of strenghth to uncork a bottle of wine.After contacting Amazon.com customer service, our entire $39.95 purchase price was refunded in the form of a gift certificate under their extended holiday gift return policy.Recently our daughter had an opportunity to use a corkpuller of a similar design. It removed a cork with far less effort.In summary, we offer a rating of 5 stars for our Amazon.com buying experience and a rating of 1 star for the Metrokane Rabbit corkpuller."
1,Ridiculous product,"I bought this corkscrew for my mom after I read some reviews of how revolutionary it was. She opened it and loved it right off the bat. Then, after less than a month, it stopped working. What happens is the little cap that covers the top of metal screw itself pops off as soon as you push down on the handle so the corkscrew just pops out of the top instead of going into the cork. It happens with all types of corks and with any pressure. So this ridiculous $50 corkscrew (at the time i bought it) is completely useless! (unless you want to pay an additional $10 for a replacement. Thanks but no thanks!)"
2,Rabbit gets sticky after four years,The device works well mechanically. You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years. Then at about four to five years of age it turns sticky and will leave a black gunk on your hands; not good.I think a $45 corkscrew should last longer than four years. Buy a Screwpull or an all-metal corkscrew.
2,matte black coating turns sticky after about 4 years,"The device works well mechanically. You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years. Then at about four to five years of age it turns sticky and will leave a black gunk on your hands; not cool.I think a $50 corkscrew should last longer than four years; so I spent about an hour with adhesive remover & alcohol and was able to remove the coating. The hard plastic that is under the coating is now blotchy, but at least my hands stay clean. It still works well mechanically, but it is no longer the pretty party tool. Buy a Screwpull or an all-metal corkscrew."
2,"Honey, the rabbit died","This is a fun piece of equipment, and as others have said here works great when it's new. (At least the second new one did -- the first one we bought didn't work at all, and the company replaced it.) But the mechanism that actually pulls the cork is made of plastic, and when you open as many bottles a week as we do, it didn't take long for them to wear out. It's now useless, and is going into the trash. For the price, it should be sturdier. I've gone back to using the $2 corkscrew I bought at the supermarket years ago and still works just fine, thank you."
2,wine fan,This is a product that disappoints. You get what you pay for in this corckscrew. It may be cheaper than others but is incredibly tough to remove the cork from the corkscrew after it is taken out of the bottle- you just exchange one problem for another. I have one of the original corkscrews from another company and will buy that brand over this product.Anyone want a used rabbit corkscrew?
4,"Nice quality, Stylish design and case","A must have for dinner parties, holidays. Yes it is expensive, but well worth it if you entertain. Guests love using it, and it is a bit of a novelty. Only problem I have is that it will not alsways ""uncork"" itstelf w/ narrow corks. However general function is smooth and precise."
2,Not as good as a Screwpull,"I have used a screwpull on several occassions and always found it a pleasure. I bought a Rabbit because it was cheaper and got good reviews. The rabbit has several drawbacks. First, the handle is not long enough and I have many times pinched my fingers between the handle and bottle when I swing the handle back to pull the cork. Second, the Rabbit does not work well on plastic corks. It's hard to get into the cork, but it can be impossible to get the cork off the screw. This sometimes happens with conventional corks as well. (In fairness I've never used a screwpull on a plastic cork.) Finally, I just don't think it's as easy to use as a screwpull. Consumer Reports rated this below the Screwpull and some other cork-pullers and this is one time I agree with them."
2,Good for about a year,I have been through two black rabbit openers. Both gradually started to fail opening fewer corks over time. The screw goes into the cork but fails to pull it out. I replaced the screw with no improvement.Apparently there is a warranty but replacement costs another $10 and after two successive failures I am staying with the old fashioned waiter's corkscrew.
3,OK but...,I have owned the Rabbit for about three weeks. I have probably opened 10 bottles with it. It works great on traditional corks. I had problems opening a bottle over Thanksgiving that had a synthetic cork. The cork came out but the force ended up bending the metal post of the Rabbit and now it does not work. I am going to send it back under warrenty. Overall 3 1/2 stars...
4,Amazingly simple,"This cork screw is the easiest I have every used. I bought one for myself about 5 years ago. Recently I had some difficulty removing the corks and noticed that the rubber grip had torn. Metrokane replaced the unit for a shipping charge of $10, no questions asked. Not bad for a 5 year old cork screw. When a friend of mine mentioned she wanted to try one I couldn't resist buying it for her as a housewarming gift. She loves hers as well.The only challenge with this products is that it is not obvious when the screw wears. The unit becomes difficult to use which makes you think the unit is wearing out when the problem is likely the screw. It is coated with teflon so you must be careful to remove the foil or wax on the top of the bottle. Apparently this will significantly shorten the life of the screw (no wonder the first one wore out so fast) But, the screw is easy to replace and does last a while if cared for properly.Great product, great value!"
5,Great Item,Very easy and convienent to use. Makes opening any bottle of wine a pleasure. The hardest part of using this product was getting it out of it's packaging! I actually look forward to using it to open my bottles of wine!
1,For Y chromosomes only.,"As stated by another reviewer, I just don't have enough strength in my hands to hold onto the levers and extract the cork. Most of the men I know have no problems. Most of the women can't get the cork out. I bought this gadget as a husband-replacer. It did not do the job."
2,Not good!,"Bought it a year ago, liked it at first, but it is very difficult to use on tight corks--and, ultimately, the handle broke off."
4,A great gift for wine lovers,"I myself keep a pretty cheap, standard corkscrew at home, but have given this model repeatedly for events from engagements and housewarmings to Christmas. Easy to use, impressive to look at - a good gift for wine lovers."
3,Cheap but expensive?!,"I'm considering buying the Metrokane Rabbit, and like what I see so far... BUT.... though it is a lot cheaper than the comparable Screwpull model two-stroker (pull/eject), it could be just as expensive as the Screwpull in the long run. Reason: with the Screwpull, when the worm must be replaced (and if it's Teflon coated it will wear off and not work at all well), you can replace just the worm; if this happens with the Rabbit (as far as I know), you'd have to buy a whole new corkscrew. I haven't been able to find out if the Rabbit's worm is replacable -- if it were, that'd make the Rabbit a REAL deal! Blurbs say the Rabbit has a lifetime guarantee, but ""worm wear"" has been my nemesis over the years. -- Sonny Grotto"
4,perfect for the household use,We have had this corkscrew since 2002 and use it fairly frequently (at least 1-2 bottles of wine a month) and it works just fine.
3,buy the newer Metrokane VERTICAL Rabbit INSTEAD,"This corkscrew was a nice first design. However, it's really huge, and it isn't flawless. The same company has developed a new version called theMetrokane VERTICAL Rabbit. That opener is nearly flawless. It's much smaller, and it is even easier to use. You can read my review on the vertical rabbit. It's truly great. Plus, the vertical rabbit comes in a few different color choices. Don't bother with the normal rabbit anymore IMO."
2,Over-Engineered and it shows in the long run,"My Rabbit worked well on the first couple dozen bottles of wine. My only complaint was (just as the manual said it might) that it was rarely able to grip the cork for easy removal from the drill. Apparently, bottles of wine under [money]uses slightly less fat corks so the Rabbit can't grip it. The design makes it very difficult to remove the pulled cork from the drill by hand. Very frustrating.Lately, the Rabbit works when it wants to. When it doesn't, it instead pushes the cork into the bottle.I've since gone back to my good old standy manual puller. It doesn't look as neat, but at least it works everytime."
2,no customer support,"My Rabbit failed after about a month. It no longer engaged the retractor mechanism. I sent it back asking for a repair or replacement. A month later I wrote Metrokane asking for the status of my unit. I also have a Houdini opener.After failing to hear from them in over a month, I sent an E mail. I got no reply to that and sent yet another inquiry. Still no reply and no opener. Very bad (non existent) customer service."
4,Great Gift. They loved it at the party!,"We brought it in for an anniversary dinner party along with a bottle of wine, and it was a great hit!Maybe not very practical, but it was fun to use during the party!"
1,Worst P of S ever,"I want to give this piece of crap 0 stars, but really it deserves a negative number. I bought this after many many failed wine openers, and i thought this was the one. I opened 3-5 bottles successfully - and then the nightmare began. i cant get a bottle open now without 20-40+ tries. sometimes it is taking so long i have to leave it alone for a bit and then come back and try again. it has nothing to do with the coated corkscrew. it is just a piece of crap. i have been meaning to send it back under its 10 year warranty, but it costs 10 bucks because they have to ship it back to you. its even more insulting that its called the rabbit when it takes me more than 5 minutes or longer to get a stupid bottle open. i really couldnt be more disappointed and disgusted. such a pain in the A**. skip it and buy something else with your money."
5,Metrokane Rabbit Corkscrew,Excellent product. Does a great job and make you look very professional while serving your guess. Great conversation piece. 10 year warranty is an added feature.Donna & Rick ReiberCanada
3,the rabbit,"Got this as a gift one month ago and all went very well until the rubber that encircles the bottle top before you press the handle down is coming apart. And I used it just as they say.I called and later got a phone call saying I would have to pay shipping back plus $10. I emailed and asked why I should pay for a defective product. Answer- that's the 10 year warranty. Let's see---$35 or so dollars, one month use, probably $15 or so dollars to pay them and ship it back---not a very good warranty. Excellent when it works and I was perfectly happy with my waiter's corkscrew. The rabbit is fun to use. More than I can say for the company. Oh yes, they said I would also have to show proof of purchase. I explained it was a gift from a person I don't know well enough to do such a thing. Lastly, a friend who knows wine and all about it said he has never heard of a rabbit holding up for very long."
4,Directrions?,Great packaging and well built. It works fine and as advertised but the directions are less than adaquate. Even a mechanical minded-friend had to fool around with it before he got it to work and could show me. I've always been a dunce at this kind of stuff.
4,"Fantastic, especially at this price!","I purchased the Metrokane Rabbit nearly two years ago (for $80), and it has worked almost flawlessly ever since. No twisted or broken corks; in fact, the only word of caution I would share with you is NOT to use the Rabbit to punch through wax seals on corks. The wax seal (often found on less expensive American chardonnays) will ""gum up"" the corkscrew, slow down the removal process, and shorten the life of your Rabbit's corkscrew (which is replaceable). Keep a regular corkscrew handy for those bottles. Also, dinner guests will love to watch/help/comment on your use of the Rabbit, and at Amazon's current price you can't go wrong."
4,"Good, especially for the new corks","I must confess, I usually use a little fork-shaped pull that doesn't pierce the cork, slips down the sides of the cork against the bottle wall and works lickety-split (costs a few bucks.) Unfortunately, the new composite corks refuse to be pulled with this cheap and formerly effective device.The Rabbit opener...works on those new corks. These corks are nasty critters that have been known to embarrass even experienced wine waiters. (Some of the European wines have a recessed or narrowed bottle neck and after a lot of pulling, a red face, raised blood pressure and titters from onlookers, you can sometimes extract these corks.) And plastic composite corks, don't get me started.Since cork is a valuable resource, and the new corks save or recycle cork, this opener makes a lot of sense. It is strong and easy to use. It's also good if you don't have the strongest hand grip in the world, too."
3,Spiral screw replacement availability,Good unit to use if you have strong hands and arms. Spiral worm has worn out (after 200 openings)and cannot find a new one. No response from Metrokane. Can anyone help?
2,"Great device, this one is too expensive","Wine openers of this kind are great. My girl friend had difficulty opening wine bottles until we bought one. Also, there is less chance of cork breakage.The only reason that I have down graded this one is price.This opener is too expensive. We bought a functional equivalent at COSTCO for $12.90. It included the opener, a neat foil cutter, and two different kinds of stoppers. And, COSTCO gives a life-time guarantee."
1,Bad buy!! Be careful.,"I bought one of these (under the Brookstone label). Terrible. Would not deal with artificial corks at all, 50/50 results on real corks. Brought it back, got another, same results. Tried third one, same results.E-mailed metrokane -- zero response!!Thankfully, Brookstone refunded the price after the third try (good company to do business with!) Then I bought a genuine Screwpull [the original]. No problems, always works flawlessly.Sometimes spending a bit more costs a lot less."
5,Good!,"Not an over-powering bar-b-q flavor. A ""light"" chip wth a great taste. I have bought these chips before, and will buy again."
4,Review product specs & reviews before pirchase,PROSCompact with cover. Uses less desk space. 500 cards will not require a refill by me. Good for what I wanted. I had researched reviewsCONSSmall cards which may limit information. Cards are NOT available for replacement.
1,What was this author thinking!?!,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. The characters are annoying and bland and the writing itself is superfluous and confusing. I felt that I had to force myself to finish it and then was angry that I didnt put it down halfway through. This book has nothing to say and is annoyingly terrible.
3,Good Entry-level PA,"I purchased this for a Coffee House. I unboxed and thoroughly tested it. Sounds good. Reverb is a bit retro ""space echo"" but it is nice at a low level. Built well enough but the knobs seem a bit flimsy, as if they could be bent or broken easily. The cables are very inexpensive but should last a while. All in all I think it'll do the job well and for 1/2 the price of the entry-level 4-input PA available at the local Guitar Center. (Note: ships with a mic and cable but I haven't bothered to try since I own some SM58s already)"
3,Pretty Decent,"This PA is alright. I bought it for an acoustic duo that I was starting up. Its not the best PA I've used, nothing is going to beat active speakers and monitors. Great for practicing (without drums). It can handle everything that I need it to handle, which is not much, but its a nice little PA."
4,Fender Squire Good Sounds,"The Squire has one thing going for it: good sound. We play laptop dulcimers, guitar, and mando, and electric bass through it, including voice. The sound reproduction is clear and true. The knobs are a little cheesy as other reviewers have noted. The set comes with a microphone and cable. The mic. is OK, not the best. It sets up easy enough, and totes easy too.The only drawback so far is the volume/power seems a bit low. If you run a piezo pickup or electric instrument it seems too have more punch. A pre-amp might help it some.All in all, it is a great little PA, I like it."
2,Unfortunately outdated,"This book consists of reports, which describe the state of the ASP market about a year ago. While writing my diploma thesis about this topic, I had to realise, that this topic loses its actuality rather quickly as the only constant element in the ASP market is change. The book focuses on so-called First-Generation ASPs putting most business emphasise on quick market presence. In the meantime the market has matured leading to 2nd and 3rd Generation ASPs, which qualifies the reports contained in this book as partially outdated basic knowledge. Today, potential ASP customers and providers use far more complex strategies to utilize the ASP concept."
4,Reaction on Mr. Madden's review,"I don't agree with mr Brian Madden. I can image why there are some ads in the book, but they did help me to reach and to get in touch with these vendors. The articles are clearly whitepapers, casestudies and reports of research companies and the are not commercial in my opinion, they only inform you of the several options. The HOTT Guide gave me an objective idea of the possibilities of ASP for my company, although I already knew some of it."
3,"not the same ""new"" bluegrass","Admist the ""new"" bluegrass movement following Alison Krauss and the ""O Brother"" soundtrack it was refreshing to hear this cd, which predates them both. The cd is not really your typical bluegrass, not is it purely New Age. It's somewhere in the middle of both genres. I had never heard Slavek's guitar work, but as I read who else was on the cd I was even more convinced of it's quality. Most notably Bela Fleck on banjo and Ron Ickes playing Dobro. The shear joy of playing music comes through on the entire album. The album is great ""background"" music or one to listen to purely for the outstanding musical talent displayed. All this music from a czech refugee, go figure."
3,surface level,"a good beginner book but the material was very basic, i was required to read it for a graduate level course and felt that perhaps it would be better suited for undergraduate students. many tests are discussed but very few details are provided. more on administering and interpreting the various tests and assessment tools is needed."
2,Archos 604 Red Case,"This product was definately a waste of money. It is pretty, and appears to be high quality craftsmanship; but it is lacking in design functionality. The biggest flaw is that it does not include any place to store the stylus. Secondly, the Archos is not securely held in this unit. It really needs a strap across the top or something in addition to the side clips. Also, there is no way to access the charging port without removing the unit from the case. Who needs a stand for a product with its own stand anyway?"
1,The killer toy,I highly reccomend that you do not get this toy it gave my little boy 6 cardbord cuts. I give it a five in durable because this toy is a killer DONT BYE BELIEVE ME!!
2,From a lover of BZI and BZII,"Okay so I'm guessing your probably wanting to buy this to find out some killer tricks or something you didn't know, or you just can't figure out how to beat the last stage? I would not tell you to buy this then. I mean sure if your a die hard BZ lover and you wanted more BZ stuff to clutter your computer desk sure buy a few copys, but you obviously have online access reading this review so just surf over to some of the hundreds of fan web sites and read their stragety guides. I'm willing to bet a few sites even have the same wording as this book(I'm sooo sure its all an accident that they just thought alike). Not a bad book if you don't want to do the online research. But I wouldn't go off spending the money for it."

THERE IS ONLY 20 FEET OF EDGING PER PACKAGE. THE EDGING IS SO THIN AND WIGGLY THAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE 40 FEET OF EDGING FOR THE SAME PRICE THAT I PAID.

1,NOT A TROMBONE,The product description was obviously written by somebody who was not very well-informed. The image is of a French Horn--not a Trombone. Please correct this.
1,Performs better as a paperweight,"Overall, this product performed like a $3 piece of garbage. Picture quality was utterly abominable. Colors were dark, the color scheme was way off, and the picture would tend to jump and skip during certain games or game-modes. Go buy a Decent RF switch from a reputable manufacturer, and save yourself the trouble."
1,Sony Playstation 2 RFU Adapter is Junk!,"This adapter works, but not very well. I wanted to be able to enjoy watching DVDs through my PS2 - no such luck! Images are fuzzy and lined, and to get back to watching television I had to disconnect it completely. Very disappointing!"
1,"Lumpy acidic, poor sub. for the real thing!","After my fig balsamic from a local california producer (and is no longer available locally) ran out I foolishly thought that I would try to find a subtitute on Amazon. Maybe one is out there but this isn't it. Take cheap nasty white vinegar and put it a blender with figs, yup that's what this is. It has none of the complex flavor of a real balsamic and the fig addition is lumpy. Really just avoid this one."
2,Color Not As Pictured,The wooden colored pieces are silver and the silver colored pieces are brown. It will stand up without gluing but I glued mine so that I could move it around easily.

1,Used at new price,I ordered the book new. It arrived with dented/chipped corners and a slightly torn spine on hardcover. I assumed it was new but slightly damaged from storage or shipping. Three weeks into the college term I am discovering highlighting already in the book. I feel ripped off.
5,Giles Tippette,"I'm just a ""normal"" Christian housewife that happens to enjoy Westerns. Not just any shoot em up type western. They seem to be a dime a dozen. I'm talking about a good story line where you get lost in the plot,the people, and the times. Giles Tippette pulls it all off as a great writer he is. I just find it hard to believe he isn't as popular as Louis La'mour and others out there. I also enjoy how Tippette spun The Warner Grayson and The Justa Williams series off from The Wilson Young series. My biggest hope for the near future is to see all of Giles Tippettes' work in Kindle format. My paperbacks and hardcovers are falling apart from use and age.Bank RobberYoung seriesThe Button HorseThe Williams series andThe Horse ThievesThe Grayson series R.I.P. Mr. Tippette"
1,Never Buy after market anything,Anything after market is going to break down or not work properly. Never buy a controller that is not Sony. If it's not Sony don't buy it. Theres a reason it is cheaper....
2,OK but...,"I thought this would be better than the 'accordion/fold up' type of sun shield I already had. Nope, it's a pain in my opinion. It DOES 'seal' better but is more difficult to put up and take down and ROLL up. I have two of these, one for a Honda Accord, the other for my new 2012 Tacoma truck. I find that the rear view mirrors get knocked out of alignment each time the shields are put up or taken down.I think I would have been happier with the type I had even though they 'wore out' after about 5 years. They were cheaper, too!Sorry but if you have ANYTHING on the inside of your windshield I think you will find these sun shields will interfere or be just to clumsy to use. I like the 'fold up' accordion type better.And what really counts: my wife says she likes the old ones better and can't believe I paid $33 each for these!"
4,2010 Toyota Tacoma sunshade review from Bubba.,"This sunshade covers the complete windshield to block out the harsh Texas sun.Not unusual for it to get over 100 degrees here.BUT it is a little hard putting it in place and removing it because it is not that flexible around the ol review mirror. ( have to adjust mirror sometimes,no big deal) AND it is a bit over priced. P.S. rolls up,does not fold up accordian style.. Yer welcome.."
4,Window shade,"The shade fit, rolls and unrolls easily. Store in the back of the passenger seat for easy access. Wife wants one for her car, will order one soon."

2,Sumamente Aburrido,"Los premios Julio CortazarHe estado leyendo o tratando de leer este libro de manera infructuosa por casi 20 días y me he dormido en 5 ocasiones, me he atorado en otras tantas y al final de la pagina 216 en el primer día de navegación del barco he decidido lanzarme por la borda y dejar la tripulación aburrida a su suerte para. Este libro pasara a ocupar el lugar de los arrumbados en mi lista de libros que trate de leer. En verdad creo que el libro es mas bien una preparación para algo mas grande como lo fue Rayuela, pero me decepciono encontrarme con un Cortazar que aun no tenia dominada la técnica del juego, que aun buscaba como darle rienda suelta a su voz literaria. Este libro podría ser interesante para alguien que este haciendo alguna disertación sobre Cortazar pero no para un lector común que busca un escape, una diversión, un juego, una enseñanza, y no dormirse en la mitad de la pagina. No hay mucho que decir sobre este libro....Luis Mendez"
5,Great Deal,"At just a few dollars (including shipping), I thought this was worth a try. It's really thick, tough green plastic that looks like it will last a while. The 9mm shells all fit great, with little wobble, while still being easy to remove. It snaps closed and stays very secure, and definitely won't open unless you purposely pull the lip out. I'm happy with it. Package arrived quickly, too."
2,Why Can't They Make Them a Bit Bigger,"If you put the rounds base up, the bases are too close together, so you cannot grip them with your fingers to pull out. If you place them with the bullets up, the tip of the bullets are too smooth to be gripped easily. The only way to get the rounds out is to flip the entire content on the table and sort out the mess.Also, the case doesn't hold the bullets securely when placed base up.Manufactured ammo comes in plastic trays that are a bit bigger, and the bottom of each slot is a bit narrow. This way the rounds are held securely in place with the base up. There is enough room to grip the base of the round with your fingers to take them out. I wish they made after market ammo boxes the same style as manufactured ammo boxes."
5,It works for me,"Basic layout, no frills, keeps ammo secure and packable. I use it in my storage cans and to take to target range."
3,Great Songs BUT...,"I have always thought that a compilation from Al Stewart would be a waste. I have reviewed other CDs by him as extremely enjoyable. The songs on this CD are well chosen and excellant representations.So what's my problem with this CD.Al Stewart has planned his CDs so well in the past that these random cuts do not convey the mood and mastery of his full CDs. I am a true fan and want everyone to experience Al's music but you really miss his real synergy of a complete album. All the parts are better a s a whole.Of course , with many compilations, my favorite individual songs are not there. Modern Times is not represented well.If you have not heard Al, please, buy this CD. If you have heard Al, you know what I am talking about."
4,Arthur's Hidden Secret,This album contins some great moments and includes some material from the later release 'Galactic Zoo Dosier'. Very experimental and bizzare in some parts but that's what you would expect from an Arthur Brown album.
2,Swiss trains on film,"The picture, obviously from a VHS, was a little grainy, and not really up to date close to this year. More like it was filmed in the 1980's. I would think twice before buying this."
3,Swiss railways dvd's,The qualkity of the colour was disappointing - proabaly because of the difference inthe systems in South Africa and the USA. Scenery stunning.
1,Worse Train Movie I ever Bought,"Color is horrible, picture is blurry, whats with the GREEN COLOR?This is an insult to the Switzerland that my Ancestors came fromand I seen in person which was Beautiful Country!!Don't Buy this is GREEN MONSTER MESS!!"
4,worth it,"leather case takes a little ""breaking in"" to fit, like most leather. Earbud is standard, works great for the price. Haven't used the charger yet, but I like the idea of having it in the vehicle just in case I need it. Overall this kit is worth twice the price."
2,"For $12.97 (shipping included), I'll keep it.","I ordered one of these back in November and sent it back when the charger plug didn't fit my VX3200. I thought Amazon would have probably sorted this out by now and I ordered another. Same plug. Turns out you need to remove a little rubber cover at the bottom of the phone to reveal a flat connector jack. Nowhere in the Starter Kit or the VX3200 User Guide is this mentioned.Now that I've figured out how to connect the charger it seems to be working. The earpiece also seems to function, but the case is pretty useless. As I said above, for $12.97 I'll keep it."
2,some parts work,"I found the price to be great. The auto charger works as does the ear speaker. The clip on holder didn't come close to holding (fitting) the phone! I attempted to stretch it to fit and it broke, it makes a nice cat toy as my kitten loves it.All in all, a decent value."
2,3 Piece Starter Kit For LG VX3300,"The automobile charger works fine, The case is a joke. It does not fit the VX3300. I did not expect the hands free attachment to be very good and I was not disappointed. Not worth the hassleto returnLeo"
4,Not a bad value,"I had a need for an outdoor speaker system that was rugged enough to betransported and set up many times.I provide music for carshows and small dances.These speakers can really handle the power. It's a good clean if notmellow sound. It is not as ""bright"" as some speakers I've owned but has good bass and midrange.There is only one jack in the back for connection to an amplifier. I would have given it an extra rating if the speaker could be ""daisy changed"".I have modified both of my speakers so this is possible.It's not hard to do and allows several to be connected to amplifiers which can handle less than 4 ohms combined.Darn good value for the money. I may purchase a few more in the future.Dogtag"
1,Not to good,"Got this toy for my son thinking it would be better than a pogo stick you have to balance. The concept is good but I thought it would have springs inside to make you go high, but no its just foam and rubber. A big disappointment. My boys like to hop around on it, but it barely gets off the ground. I wouldnt recommend this item."
1,We will be returning it,"My nine year old daughter who is a very active child and loves active toys, found this to be very very disappointing. She already owns actual pogo sticks and is quite skilled on them .. we were hoping for an active toy she could use indoors or possibly on the hard dirt in our back, but the bungee jumper just thudded, was hard work and not too much fun - and was the same when I tried it ... maybe it was her height or her weight, maybe it would work well if you were a certain size, but was very disappointing for us."
3,it is ok,"hard to get going..kids lost interest quickly. doesn't go very high, but that is why I bought it, I didn't want them to hurt themselves. Now it lays in the garage, covered with spider webs."
2,Lame!,"""Lame"" was the word my husband used when he saw the kids using this toy. My 6 year old (who's gift it was) could hardly make it move and lost interest immediately. My older children (7,9,11, and even 16) tried it and found it unexciting, difficult, and too much work for little pleasure. This is a waste of man-made material that will exist in a land-fill till the end of time."
2,One trick pony,"I bought this for my 6-year-old niece for Xmas. Most of the complaints I read were about difficulty of use. It's a bit difficult to get started, but most kids can master in a few tries. But after a few fun jumping sessions, that's about it. It's a great workout, but I don't see a really long life for this toy. My complaint is more about the product's construction. The foam around the bungee cord started to tear within a few days, and she is 35 lbs, WELL under the 250-lb. weight limit. The company did send a replacement promptly after my complaint so we'll see how that holds up."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"From the description, one would think this is a bouncy jumper. There is very little bounce in the foam bottom. Children are able to jump and get some exercise with it, but the fun ratio is quite limited."
2,Unclear about its use,"We were given a used Bungee Jumper in great condition and my 4-yr. old was very excited about it, but I didn't know what it was. I first thought it was just an exercise accessory for an aerobics class. It has stretchy cords but I couldn't figure out what the base was for. I tried jumping on it, but the foam base seemed to absorb my weight rather than rebound it. So I looked it up online, and was surprised to easily find it listed for kids as an alternative to a pogo stick! What a surprise! I don't think it fulfills the purpose it was designed for, but the part I do like is that my kids like it and they can use it inside the house."
3,Jumper for small kids,this is hard to coordinate for very small kids and the handles are too short for bigger kids Concept works but only moderately
1,not very informative for do it yourselfers,"The problem with this book is that it tries to cover a wide range of models in one book. The book gets into the details only to subject the ""do it yourselfer"" to a surprise i.e the component that they speak of in the book is, either not there in your vehicle or is not at the location where they state in the book. Needless to say working on a typical installation becomes a bit of a guessing game since you do not know what awaits you. The book definately does not cover all inline six models from 1984 to 1996, my truck is 1995 and it don't look anything like what them folks at Haynes are talking about.I wish somebody at Haynes would read this and straighten it out for me."
3,No problems,"no problems. This is a Haynes book. They're all alike so it works exactly as expected. It's relatively inexpensive, but it's not the best repair book available. received on time or before. Only complaint is that delivery charges are high, which brings expectations for this up and appreciation for it down."
4,2 great movies from 2 great actors,"casino (de niro) is a slow goodfellas (has the same actors > de niro, pesci; and director > scorsese).. but its still a great movie, it has great acting, directing, and story.carlito's way (pacino) seems like its a sequal to scarface (which also stars pacino, & also directed by de palma). like casino, carlito's way is a slower paced version of its previous counterpart, but its still a great movie....too bad warner brothers and universal cant get together and produce a GOODFELLAS/SCARFACE value pack, now thats a set i would definately buy if i already didnt own them"
3,second hand confusion,"The second hand should be a different color than the minute and hour hands. When you look at the watch, the short part of the second hand and the hour hand are virtually indistinguishable. It takes too long to tell the time. The Indiglo is very nice for telling the time without having to get out of bed at night. It also requires a special tool to remove links to size the watch band, so if you buy it online, you'll have to find a store that sells Timex and will remove a link for you."
4,Suzy Chase,"I bought this watch for my wife. She loves the watch. It was a gift and just want she was looking for! She actually has one very similar (TIMEX) which is STILL working and has had it for many many years. But she wanted one that was a little dressier to wear out at dinners, parties, etc. This watch fit the bill. Her only complaint and she certainly can have it fixed I'm sure is that it is too big for her wrist, She is an aversage sized woman. Just seems for a womans watch that it should be smaller."
4,Very nice but didn't like color of crystals- too child-like-,"Crystals are too child like not real looking for adult watch- very Iridescent in style.. not what I wanted. I have other ""Sworoffski""( dont know how to spell the guy's name ) {he makes scope lenses that are very &&&&&} watch crystals and they are nice. I guess this one just is the iridescent type and not my style. but it is nice other than that."
1,Not of much help,This book attempts to emulate The Elements of Style by Strunk and White but it doesn't even come close. It is poorly written and organized and is likely to confuse its readers. It fails to provide good examples in many cases. Explanations which should be simple are often quite complex.I minored in English and am an experienced well published writer but I found this book of little assistance. It is not particularly useful for teachers. I can not think of anyone who would find this book useful.For anyone trying to improve their grammar or even learn it I would suggest Checking Your Grammar by Marvin Terban which is a superb book.
1,Nothing Special,"I bought this book hoping to learn new ways to use vellum. All I found were typical ideas that I had already thought of myself--and trust me, if I were a master at coming up with unique ideas, I would not have needed to buy this book. This book basically shows you how to use vellum as a background, for text, and for photo borders. I was hoping to find patterns that would teach me how to make unique vellum shapes and embellishments. A waste of money."
3,"Nice, but no longer cutting edge.","When this book first came out it was something to write home about, but no longer. Unless you are brand new to scrapbooking and have never poked through a CK or a Memory Makers magazine you've seen most of these ideas before. That being said, it's a well done book with a lot of really nice looking examples. This one's time has probably passed for most scrapbookers who are looking for the most up to date trends."
4,It works but it arrived a day late.,"There is a big difference in quality between both composite and component PS2 cables. This is obviously better and before i made the purchase, i was sort of skeptical about buying this because of the reviews, but i bought it anyways. Thank god i made this purchase because i hated the low quality composite cables and i needed to play my PS2 in good quality on my HDTV (Dynex 32"" Class). I would recommend this to anybody who has an HDTV and still plays the PS2.If you guys are having problems on installing it then here are the steps:1. Assuming you're on RGB composite cables, go to ""System Configuration"" and then scroll down to ""Component Video Out"".2. Press ""X"" then highlight ""Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr"" but don't press ""X"" again.3. Then remove your composite cable and then insert your new component cable to the console and to the TV (obviously).4. Change your TV input to ""Component"" and then press ""X"". You should now see a clear and crisper version of the PS2 Menu."
5,The thing works well.,"Cable is inexpensive, and feels well made.Only thing, it seems susceptible to interference from other devices that it is sitting on (or its the PS2 that receives the interference), so if you experience snow try turning the PS2 vertical. That fixed my problem.Great cable."
1,SUX!!!!!,DOA. Only sound works and no video. I tried different combinations and no cigar. Avoid this product like the plague.
3,Works OK with PS2,The first time I tried it it didn't work. But for some reason I tried it again and it worked. However there doesn't seem to be any advantage over the standard cables that come with the PS2.
4,Cheaper PS2 component cables do great job.,You must 1st set your Playstation 2's settings to Video Output YPbPr. Using the cord on a VGA monitor and the video difference is like night and day. This is so much better over RCA. Not 100% sure how the comparison fares over a real HDTV though.
2,I had high hopes =/,"So I had high hopes that finally getting a component cable for my ps2 would be a great thing. I bought a new tv about a year ago and it wasn't compatible with the old red, yellow & white cables so I wasn't able to play it. So recently I decided hey, how about I buy some component cables, the price got me excited.... until I received the wires... I had a few problems here and there getting them to connect to the ps2, and finally they connected. But here's the BIG problem! The colors on screen don't match up, there's a horrible green tint!! I tried everything, switching the wires and the whole bit, I still got that crappy green tint! None of the other colors of my game showed, everything was greenish yellow looking.So, the wires do work, but they don't show the right colors on screen, which is a TOTAL WASTE! -_-Very disappointed in this product.Good thing I only wasted 4 dollars on this junk."
1,BUY THE COMPONENT A/V cable MADE BY SONY,"I got the new Component AV cable. The plug part that goes into the PS2 did not fit snug.Didnt spend over 5.00 for it,but if i had to do it over again I would have went to Radio shack to get the SONY BRAND. If you ever have to send in your SONY PS 2 make sure you use SONY BRAND PARTS /CABLES (anything really). If you use this part your WARRANTY is not worth the paper it is printed on. Check out Playstation FAQs at their website."
5,PS2 Looks Great,These cables did wonders for my ps2 on my HDTV. I play Socom Combined Assult and the graphics with these cables compared to regular composite cables is amazing. I didnt realixe the ps2 could look so good. These cables are cheap but they work very good for ps2. If you get more expensive cables maybe the quality will go up but to me this is the best bang for your buck. I'm excited to see other games in HD like God of War and Gran Tourismo 4 which I have heard look great with these cables.
3,It worked great while it lasted,"I purchased this item so that I could record games on my playstation 2 with my Roxio Game Capture Card. It worked great didn't really have any trouble at all at first. I used it for about 2 weeks then it started flickering the screen and now it won't work at all. I know it's the cable because my ps2 works just fine with it's rca cable. Not sure if it's just this one I got or the cable in general, I might get another one, but so far it's not rating too good with me."
2,It does not work on PS2 slim !,"It does not work on PS2 slim !Material is good also shipping was on time, but it did not work on my PS2 console!! Only I have sound! not picture!"
5,Difference is amazing.,I wish I would have had a pair of these when I first got a HDTV. They work 100% and the difference is really noticeable. They do work with HDTVs that have Y Pb Pr inputs.
1,Terrible,"I ordered these cables to hook up my PS2 to my new HDTV. So much for amazing picture clarity. At worst I got scrambles and at best I got black and white. What made this worse was that the company customer ""service"" department never did answer my emails with questions (no telephone option available). Needless to say, I returned these cables and bought the Sony brand equivalent. They work great."
1,PS 2 cord--a waste unless you like black & white,"Although this PS 2 cord was inexpensive it only displays the PS2 games in black & white, so it is useless. Would have been nice if the company would have let us known in their item details....waste of money."
3,"it works but, not high def","I bought this following the purchase of a new HDTV. I was hoping that using this cable would deliver HD quality from my PS2. However, this is not the case. The picture quality is better than composite cables but clearly not HD. I believe this is a function of the PS2, not the cable. Be sure to read the instructions on how to install. You do need to make some changes in the settings of your PS2 to view the picture on the HDTV otherwise, you will not be able to see the video feed."
1,Not approved by Sony- will void your warranty,"I bought these cables last week and hooked them into my HDTV. The difference in video quality between these cables and the composite A/V cables that came with the PS2 was amazing- at first.The cables work just fine for video games, but every time I tried to play a DVD through the PS2, the signal blanked out after about three minutes of viewing, and the only way to get video back was to reset the PS2.A 45 minute phone call with Sony tech support traced the problem to these cables, which did not meet Sony's testing standards. Additionally, the Sony rep I spoke with informed me that if my PS2 hadn't already passed its warranty period long ago, using these cables would have voided my warranty.Do not buy these cables. They are cheap for a reason- they do not work properly."
1,"ok product, SHI TTY company","The wires work as they should for all PS console platforms PS0Ne, PS2, PS3 but the company sucks. Take Your money elsewere, its not worth the headache. These idiots know nothing of customer service, but to someones credit, amazon did refund Me My money, but thats hardly the point, esp. since it was such a cheap buy; I want to be treated w/ dignity when I buy something. The ""You get What You pay for"" credo isn't good enough for Me, whether I purchase a 0ne cent Item or Five hundered-thousand dollar item I demand respect. I & every other consumer out there deserves much more then being treated like a dollar bill with fingertips, with which to place an order.The consumer industry are many but together We consumers are greater. Beware the wrath of the consumer!"
2,Just plain did not work,"I got this item because the cable for my PS2 was loose and would not stay in. Now to it's credit, the sound was great! However....3 of the five plugs did not work properly. The video cable only put out black and white. No color. Two of the sound cables did not work at all. The two sound cables that did work, sounded great.So, basically, it was a waste of money. to make matters worse and this has nothing to do with the product) the seller refused to respond to my repeated attempts at contact....Not happy at all with this product."
3,Good when it works properly,"This is a very low end cable. It's $0.07 after all. It works pretty well. Sometimes I have to mess around with the plugs to get them ""just right"", which is kind of a pain. The sound is also not very good out of these cables. I wish I had bought the more expensive brand."
3,Issues with PS1 games played through PS2,"This cable works great when playing actual PS2 games on my PS2. With my new HDtv, I put in FFX and was horrified by how bad it looked going through the normal composite cables that come with the PS2. But with these, it looks, downright beautiful. Gone are the scan lines and the muddied colors stretched to fit, and i am very happy with the results.But the PS2 is backwards compatible, and i enjoy a lot of PS1 games still, sadly, with this cable connected I can't get past the menus of any PS1 game. I've gone through and tried every combination of settings I could find but they all just stop after the initial Sony of America etc. screens. So keep that in mind if you intend to play a lot of PS1 games, because as it stands my PS2 Slim is now a PS2 only machine."
5,Great buy,I bought these cables in order to connect my old PS2 to my new LCD TV. The original cable from the PS2 worked but the video quality was really poor. These cables allowed me to connect the PS2 to the Component input on my LCD and to set the PS2 video output to 480p. The difference in quaity of video is exceptional. I decided to try them as they are cheap and I did not expect them to make a great difference but they did! Great buy.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,I bought this cable and it did not work at all. I tried it out on multiple TVs. It was a complete waste of time and money for a piece of junk.
1,Cable does not work.,"The cable was corrupted. It does not work. It has short circuit on red pin.But I spent all night untill I define this defect and another dey to solve this problem.The short circuit was in small box where cable dividing on components.It seems, that this is very poor quality product.So it's up to you guys, maybe not all this cables are spoiled.Try your luck."
3,"Its not a game, its hardware","Supports HD content, but keep in mind you have to have or download additional content for HD.Works just fine, I just needed an upgrade from the usual red white and yellow."
1,Doesn't work.,I guess you get what you pay for. Wasted my money on this. Still had to buy another at local game store for more money.
1,Waste of Money,I bought these cables thinking they would improve the picture quality of the PS2 while playing on my HDTV. Purple and green colored lines go through the picture and the colors are way off when playing video games and watching DVD's on the PS2 when using this cable. I guess for the price one cannot expect much from this company. I have already ordered an official Sony component cable to replace this garbage. If you want quality then go for either Monster or an official Sony component cable if you want to improve picture quality of your PS2 gaming and movie watching experience. This company should not even be able to shovel out crap like this to people!
4,Works great on LCD TV,I puchased this product to connect my PS2 through Component Video in my LCD TV. It is not that excelent since the cables are not high performance but it works great and it is much better than the common A/V cable.
5,Remember to change the settings on your PS2.,When I first hooked up the cables they were not working. Thought they were defective since the price was so good. Then I talked to a relative. He said to change the settings in the PS2. I did and it works great. To switch settings you have to start the process using the 3 wire cables and then plug in the Component cable after you switch to it on the PS2.
1,Very bad product,"Very bad product, it does not work, the cable inside when compared to the original cable is totally different, and it did not work with my PS2, not recommended"
1,You'd better have an O-L-D computer to run the software,Wont work with windows xp or windows vista. Software will not install. You can only hook this up to a computer with windows 95 or windows 3.1......did I say Windows 3.1....we're talking antique here.
2,Talk with me barbie only runs on pre 1995 windows op. systems.,"The item was in great shape and just as described. It arrived promptly. I did not know, due to lack of reasearch on my part that this doll will not do crap if you hook it up to a computer that is running windows newer than 1995....not even with vista. Newer windows systems can not open files. So I just have a really strange looking doll until I can get a computer that runs windows 95...so not worth it."
5,Upright is WAY better.......,"Ok. I do NOT keep my PS2 upright because it ""looks better."" Whether you choose to dust the console or not, it does have an overheating problem. I had to throw out the last PS2 after 10 months because it wouldn't work anymore. It used to get extremely hot. So I tried this and keeping it upright. No more overheating AT ALL. For the money I spent for the console I can put a few more bucks into something that makes it last longer. It is an easy solution. And it is not as easy to knock over as one would think. I have 3 rambunctious boys (one a climbing toddler),a hyper dog and 3 cats who think the top of the entertainment center is their playground. It has not been knocked over even ONCE yet. Give it a try..."
2,Disappointed ... Darn!,"I've worn Timex's FOREVER so I assumed this watch would be as good as any others I've owned. WRONG. It was absolutely stunning when brand new: shiny and very classy-looking. But in less than TWO WEEKS, the band had scratches that made it look worn and cheap. (I promise I did not mistreat it!) And, to make it worse, the band actually consists of link caps/covers of which TWO have popped off and been lost, exposing the boring ugly stretch band underneath. Granted, the watch face still looks nice and I can use it with a replacement band but since I bought this for the classy band, I am terribly disappointed."
3,Timex Watch,"This is very nice watch, very attractive. The only downside is that the very high polished band will scratch easily if used daily. It would be perfect except for the scratching issue, which makes it impractical for daily use. I had to purchase another watch to wear while working in the yard and doing housework, to eliminate the problem. It is a very reliable watch, however."
1,Results,"Watch did not work upon receipt, even after following manufacturers instructions for checkout. Thought it may ahve been a bad battery. Took it to a jeweler for battery replacement, informed the pc board was bad. Cost of repair exceeded the price of the wacth several fold."
5,Womans Timex Watch,Great piece!! It has the 2 tone so it goes with everything I wear. Can be used for dress down or fancy! Great price for a timex I have been everybit of thrilled that I made this purchase!
3,Timex Watch,This watch is even prettier in person than it was online. The only downside is the band does not strech very much. It fits fine once it is on. My last watch had an expansion band and it streched fine. I think the larger links cause the issue.
4,Place these in Your Resource Library!,This book is a great resource tool to have at your disposal! It provides tips and information not often shared in teaching courses. I highly recommend it.
5,A Classic,This book was recommended to me by many people--professors in my master's degree program and English teachers. I borrowed a copy and I knew right away I had to have my own. This book has it all--sound theory and excellent examples of practical techniques in action. It even discusses how to get a job. The portions on class room instruction were especially interesting to me because I see discussion as the most important thing that happens in an English class. This book is The Book to get if you're going to teach English (especially high school English). I have enjoyed all of Burke's books and I hope there are more to come.
4,Good Lengthy Book,"This book - like previous editions - is an excellent book for classroom teachers. It covers what an English teacher must know with plenty of excellent facts and practical suggestions. The author knows what he is talking about from years of experience.That said - there are some problems. Previous editions were quite compact with short but excellent descriptions of what a teacher had to know to put something into practice.. This one is different. The explanations are often much too long and contain a ton of detail, some of which is needed.Compared to previous editions, this edition need a little slimming down."
5,Exceptionally Useful in Teaching,"I absolutely LOVE this book. Being new to field, I find it extremely helpful with lesson planning and how to approach situations such as reading and writing. Definitly worth the purchase."
4,English Teacher's Companion,"This is a really good book with lots of great information and good ideas for teachers both new and experienced. However, you'll have to get by his ""look at me"" pompousness and the many errors. It looks like Mr. Burke decided to edit the book himself, as he's so good at what he does. While I'm sure he is a really great teacher, all writers need a really great editor. The deficiencies can be overlooked because of the variety of quality information. Putting his picture on both the front and back of the book was a bit overdone, though..."
5,Burke's book is a must buy for every English teacher,"Seldom have I seen a book as comprehensive and as valuable for preservice and inservice teachers of English. He writes with conviction, confidence. About this writer we can clearly say ""gladly would he learn and gladly teach."" I think we could all learn from him."
4,Student Teachers - Get this book!,"I started student teaching and I'm glad I bought this book. It's lengthy and covers nearly all topics. It puts everything together and is practical. I have read some education books that are just idealistic thoughts but impractical for the classroom. This is not like that at all.The book has some good ideas. I've used some. In different chapters it discusses teaching reading, vocabulary, writing, AP classes, gender, race and culture in literature, teaching controversial novels, teaching special needs children and many topics. It is all-in-one book."
5,A Must For Every English Teacher,"I just started my 25th year of teaching and I am always on the lookout for new, fresh ideas. That's exactly what I got in Jim Burke's book. You can tell a teacher wrote it because it is designed to be read a few pages at a time in the teachers' lounge over a cup of coffee. I carry it in my briefcase and pull it out when I'm waiting for the kids at the dentist, during commercials of Indianapolis Colts football games, and waiting in the school parking lot for my daughter after volleyball practice. I've also contacted Jim on several occasions about teaching issues and he is extremely helpful and incredibly responsive. I'm not quite sure how he does all he does. If you are a first year teacher, buy this book. If you're approaching the end of your career, buy this book. If you're somewhere in between, buy this book."
2,Part of another book,"""This booklet ... reproduces chapter 2 of my recent book Visual Explanations ..."" (quote from the first page).The material is outstanding, as is all of Tufte's, but I was very disappointed to pay for something I already had."
4,How not to lie with graphics,"This book is not as incisive as Tufte's classic ""The Visual Display of Qantitiative Information"". It does, however, discuss in cogent detail how to design a graphical display so that it will clarify ideas and not mislead the viewer. We are subject daily to a blizzard of deliberate dis-information by such means. Tufte's plea for clarity and honesty seems almost quaint by today's standards. Thank you, sir."
5,Extraordinary publication,"This is a very well written, very well edited and very well published book.It is highly informative and motivating. Even if one has no interest in statistics, conveying information or even graphic design, you are likely to learn a few relevant facts and enjoy the tactile qualities of this item. A real bargain if you consider its depth and quality against price. A must have!"
4,excerpt,"This pamphlet is largely two excerpted case studies from Tufte's other books, so it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Having said that and understanding its limited scope, it makes a great classroom tool both for information graphics and for areas of related study. It is inexpensive enough to supplement a text book and it a nice - as are all of Tufte's books - object."
5,Voles beware,I purchased this as a vole repellant. There are lots of internet articles about using a caster oil / soap / water mixture to repel voles and I've purchased similar products from hardware stores. This is a much more economical method - make your own. Maybe my hosta will survive . . . .
5,Fantastic oil,I use it with a flannel and water bag.It heals all the organs and skin.It should be used on the regular basis to help.
3,Sticky and causes shedding,I am using this for my hair only. I'm natural with 3c/4a hair. It's sticky. I don't use it that much. I decided to use it as a oil for my sulfur mix. It's a heavy oil. I have a lot of shedding when I use it.
4,Castor Oil,I purchased this to use on my natural hair but I found it to be a little heavy. Perhaps I used too much. I think this would be a great product to add to my hair and skin regimen if I can only figure out how much to use.
4,Great except for the shipping.,"First purchase of castor oil. I am using it on my hair (Caucasian), face and décolleté. Apparently it reduces wrinkles, scars and acne in addition to many other uses. I am excited to see if it helps the S. Dermatitis on my face (nothing says it will, but with myriad other uses, one can hope).The oil is everything one would expect. The shipping was not. Item arrived via USPS. There was very little packing in the box which resulted in a broken cap. Some oil did leak into the box (inconsequential - absorbed by cardboard). Good thing I had a spare cap from a different product. Otherwise this item from this seller would get a 5 star rating."
5,Love it,I juse Castor Oil for everything. This brand is awesome and very cost effective I brought the 16oz last time and it took some time to use it but now I use castor oil from head to toe. I mix castor oil in with other oils like evoo and coconut oil also it works wonders on my eyelashes and eyebrow growth! Just a wonderful product all around
5,Great Price for Pure Castor Oil!,"I bought this castor oil to use in making my own shaving oil. I purchased this brand because of the excellent price and reviews. Whenever I replenish my supply of castor oil, I will order from the same company! I also found that the castor oil is great for your skin--something I had never known before. It also works great in my shaving oil!"
5,For elderly hospice patients,"We use this wonderful oil after we bathe my mother, just all over her body. Use before you dry the skin. We have been successfull in keeping any bedsores at bay and keeping her skin from cracking. I think it is a natural anti inflammatory and my nurse raves how great her skin is. I also tried it on my face and the moisterizing properties are amazing."
5,Good Buy!,I used a lot of castor oil for cosmetics and bathing. You can save a lot of money in buying 32oz pack as compare to small size. They typically overcharge you 2-3 times. I don't see any difference in quality.
2,I had high expectations but......,"This is the first book by Loretta Chase that I've read. I bought this book based on the good reviews. I enjoyed thie beginning very much. Lydia was a great herione. She had all the qualities that I like in a heroine. She was smart, brave and independent. I didn't really like Vere that much. He was so overdone that I really couldn't warm up to him at all. I know he suffered a lot of personal tradgey but he needed to get over it already.In the beginning the verbal foreplay between Lydia and Vere was great. When the finally did have sex, the scenes were disappointing. They didn't have any of the passion that I expected and they were pretty boring.At about page 252 this book seemed never ending. It dragged and dragged and Ms. Chase added in my opinion an unnecessary plot twist. Also the constant references to to her previous books was annoying.Sensuality rating 2 out of 5."
3,Ok,"I'm a big fan of historical romance and after reading all of Julia Quinn's books, I was trying to find another author in a similar style of writing. This is my first Loretta Chase book and it was disappointing. I know a lot of people loved this book, but it wasn't very engaging for me. I did enjoy the protective hero, but her writing didn't appeal to me at all."
4,Author has a great writing style,The prologue was depressing and I was wondering where the author was going to go from there. I was pleasantly surprised. I really like Loretta Chase' writing style. Full of humor & wit! I really enjoyed this book and think this author has a great way with words.She had me wondering at first how Vere was going to convince us he had any redeeming qualities. I didn't like him at all at first. He did grow on me. I enjoyed both lead characters & the supporting cast. I even liked the dog. This book is a very enjoyable read!
1,Terrible follow up to the lord of scoundrels,"I was a big fan of the lord of scaundrels, but this book it's terrible!!! Too wordy, I cannot identify with either characters and the scene just go on and on. Never ending. Author tried to tie this book way too much with the other book. Not sure I can read another book by this author after this one.It's really disappointing!!"
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"I really enoyed "" The Last Hellion"". I found Vere's sweetness and that fact that he was embarassed by his sentimental side and his kindess to be adorable!! I really enjoyed his and Lydia's sparring..Also, it was sweet to see Bertie and Tamsin get together...I loved the fact that Sebastian and Jess were included in this book, but I wished that there had been some more scenes with Jess..we didn't really get to see her at all...Oh well...not my favorite story, but definitely not a bad one either....Charming."
2,Disappointing.,"After reading Lord of Scoundrels, which I absolutely loved, I couldn't wait to read another book by Loretta Chase. Unfortunately, The Last Hellion did not live up to expectations. I could not identify with either of the lead characters and Vere was such a disagreeable character in Lord of Scoundrels that I found it difficult to like him in this book. It is hard not to compare this book to Lord of Scoundrels, especially when it contains references to that book and its characters - Dain, Jess and Bertram. I didn't want Lord of Scoundrels to end but The Last Hellion just seemed to drag on and on long after I expected it to end."
3,cute,"The couple had good chemistry. He keeps pulling her (reporter heroine) out of trouble. A funny light read, but some things stuck out as just way too far-fetched for the story.The Duke of Ainswood is the drunk character from 'Lord Of Scoundrels' -- that Dain fought with."
2,This book needs an editor!,"This book reminds me of quite a few papers written at about 2 in the morning when I was in college. Although it definitely had potential, it comes off as more of a first draft than a final version. I found it painful to read a book where the author couldn't even keep the characters' names straight, much less construct well thought out sentences! Don't read this book unless you can stomach the often horrible writing which accompanies a sometimes interesting plot."
3,"My thoughts on ""Analog Days""","I ended up having mixed thoughts on this book. Initially the book started well. The only reservation that I was starting to have was that it wasn't technical enough. I accepted the premise that the authors didn't want it to be technical, but as a professional electronics engineer I would have liked to seen some more detailed information that would not have been off-putting to a non-technical reader.Later on in the book things started to fall apart. The material seemed to be more on the general Californian scene, which, whilst interesting, seemed to be less relevant to the Moog story. I would have preferred to have seen material on Moog & his enterprises from the 70's & 80's up to the present day.Then finally the final chapter was a complete disappointment. I was not expecting a summary of the book. A total waste of space in which other material could have been presented."
4,A Good History of the Moog Synthesizer,"As an unsatisfiable 'gear head,' the thing I thought was lacking was a greater examination of the modular Moog itself, and especially a detailed analysis of some of the more esoteric/custom modules that Moog made for various customers. After all, this was THE machine that set the engineering standards for years, almost decades to come. (Case in point, Moog's 902 Voltage-Controlled Amplifier was developed in the early '60s, and yet is still almost CD audio quality some 40 years later!) At least give us some loving closeups of Keith Emerson's 'Monster Moog!'The interviews make up for the lack of photos, especially with the lesser-known lights who helped blaze the trail but are largely forgotten today."
4,glib but fun,"I liked this very much and recommend it for anyone involved any way in electronic music.I have a few reservations, however:1) I would prefer more technical information.2) The prose tends to be trite, and there are misspellings and other errors. ""All right"" is repeatedly misspelled as ""alright"", for example. The Hammond B-3 is labeled an ""electronic"" instrument, when in fact it is an electrical or electro-mechanical instrument; like the electric guitar, its sound is AMPLIFIED electronically (""electronic"" means using a tube or transistor, which is essentially what an amplifier is), but it is not created electronically.3) Some of the connections are strained. The book promises us, for example, to show how the invention of the Moog synthesizer has intimately to do with the tuba, but this turns out to be a rhetorical ruse. One of Moog's associates happened to have played the tuba, and that's it."
5,Fascinating insights into a ground-breaking musical movement,"Totally recommended. Apart from a little slide into sociological theory towards the end, this is a thoroughly entertaining, authoritative and enthralling look at the world of early synthesizers.My favourite moment is the story of Bob Moog's first major sale of a modular synthesizer. He had to get it to New York City from Buffalo, and in those days, there was one sensible, cost-effective solution: he took the bus. The synthesizer seemed to survive the trip, too.Lovely book.. If you are interested in synthesizers or the histroy of electronic music, BUY IT!!"
4,Steele zeroes in on source of liberalism,"Steele has written a concise, but profound analysis of what makes liberals tick. In short: white guilt. He explains how white guilt over the injustice of slavery later metastasized into a destructive mindset over the treatment of America's black population as this group continues to be treated as an abstraction, a class of eternal victims, rather than being approacned as individuals who should be encouraged to take personal responsiblity for their own lives."
3,White guilt,"I bought this book for a friend, he really like it, but to me it is too biased, i personally didn't care for it, but i respect others opinions, even if i don't agree, but my friend really enjoyed it."
2,"Good book - Needs editor,","Lots of good points but too many show-off, pedantic words and sentences that detract from the good ideas. This books message could have been written in a 2 page New Yorker magazine article."
2,High hopes...disappointed,"I bought this book with high expectations. The subject matter seemed interesting, the fact that it was written by an African-American intrigued me, and I heard some good things about this book. While Steele does have some good points and information to share, the book itself was extremely boring. That sounds childish I know, but it simply was not written for the purpose of keeping the reader's attention. I do have some gratitude to display however, reading Mr. Steele's book did a wonderful job of putting me to sleep on some restless nights. My advice - find another book about this interesting phenomenon."
5,Best book on race I've ever read,"It is very hard to see what anyone who actually read this book could find wrong with it. His analysis puts into well ordered paragraphs things I have felt for years, but he does it with conviction and power. There is no need for me to go into great detail here. Steele nails issue after issue. If you have doubts, read his analysis about why black kids do poorly in school, where they are treated as ""at risk"" and as specimens to be coddled and assisted at every turn, where every failure is not their fault, and excel on the basketball court, where their success or failure is theirs alone. I taught at an inner city school; oh my, was this accurate.As long as the left continues to define racism by inequality of results, it is guaranteed to get those results. Steele explains why. And why they like it that way. This is a short book, but a dense one, requiring slow, careful reading. But worth it. Oh so worth it."
3,Use language thats easy to understand,"This book would have been more enjoyable if Mr. Steele did not try to show off his knowledge of big words. Seems like I lose interest if I have to stop and look for a dictionary every page (keep it simple,, you will get your point across better)"
5,White Guilt,"This book is great for all who would like to understand why ongoing tension still exist between white and black. Mr. Steele offers well thought-out reasoning as well as examples of how this came about. Rather than letting assumptions (because someone is black or because he is white) dictate how we view someone and how they are going to act, we should be looking at the content or substance that person has. Added to that, we don't let their assumptions about us dictate how we act or respond.This book is well worth the read!"
2,overpriced for size,"Knew this was not full-sized item when purchased, but was not pleased with totally dimunitive size (Christmas tree ornament dimensions)."
3,read details!!!,"I thought it was the book, not a coloring book. I'll have to be more careful next time. My bad!"
4,Cute book to read at Christmas time to your kids,"I recommend this book to anyone that embraces Cajun culture. It's a parody to Twas the Night Before Christmas, but it has a Cajun slant on the story."
3,also disappointed but for different reasons,"First let me say that Mindell has something important to add to the field of dreaming and psychology. This guy is no hack.Having said that, this book could stand a good editing. There are references and diagrams that add nothing to the text. And he frequently must bring in the Aborigine, Buddhist, and Psychoanalytic perspectives, even when they add nothing to the discussion. On one occasion, he reprints a diagram a scant page and a half after the first occurence, because he wants us to look at it again and it would be too hard for us to just turn back a page and look at the first presentation. (It's things like that which cause me to think he's just padding to make the book longer.)The book is good. I just feel a little patronized by the redundant way he describes simple ideas, as if they were great and important concepts."
2,Not a book about lucid dreaming,"Arnold Mindell seems to think that dreambody experiences are limited to ""body knowledge"". Although this is an important point, there is a vast universe of lucid dreaming waiting to be explored for those who invest the energy. My point is: do not buy this book because you're interested in lucid dreaming. It will teach you nothing in that area. Also, I'm a little skeptical as to whether Mindell's techniques actually does put you in contact with the ""big mind"", or if it's just a cute little mind-game you (or Mindell and his wife) can play for yourself, telling yourself you're making great progress on the spiritual path. Come on...! This is lucid dreaming for the old and weary."
2,Be careful with new systems,"This software might have been helpful for past systems--see system requirements--but it wouldn't work on my daughter's vista based laptop. The seller sold with integrity but I didn't read carefully enough. Please learn from my mistake. There are many other, newer products that would work (and have worked for me) far better."
3,"The Anglo-Irish War, 1916-1921","Just read Kautt's book last night in one sitting, which is quite possible considering it is only 113 pages long, plus Appendices. Extremely well annotated, with references to primary and secondary sources abounding. For people with an interest in this topic, it is truly a great reference point. The thing I enjoyed most about the book is the author's explanation of WHY events happened, not just WHAT the events were. Very interesting hypothesis that this was the first ""Peoples War"". One chapter focuses on guerilla warfare, in general, which is a great stage-setter for the rest of the book. I also enjoyed the final chapter, which is an analysis of ""what went right and what went wrong"" on both sides."
4,An new insight into Irish history,"William Kautt's in depth study of the Anglo-Irish War is an outstanding piece of craftsmanship and detailed research. He marries an intense love of Irish history with in depth analysis in a style which allows the lay reader into the murky world of guerilla warfare and the back-story behind the ""Troubles"" of Northern Ireland. Furthermore, the author's straightforward style aids in understanding both the military and social implications of this war. In here you will find a strong case for why the Anglo-Irish War was the first ""People's War"" of the 20th century, preceeding the work of Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh, and this alone is an insight into Irish History which will be new to most readers. You don't need to be an expert on Che Guevera or the Emerald Isle to enjoy this book. If you're looking for an introduction to unconventional warfare, this is a fine place to start. Grab a pint of Guiness and learn something!"
5,Littell satisfies with character development and history,Robert Littell's extensive knowledge of Russia is put to gooduse in this expose of the bankruptcy of Soviet Communism. The hopes ofAlexander Til and his friends are interwoven with historical accounts of one of the greatest thefts of all time. Littell shows how Stalin and others stole the hopes of the Russian people for a better life after the Revolution. The book is a great read and very informative about Russian and Soviet history. Great character development.
2,Tedious,Not up to the authors usual smooth narrative and driving plot line. This book is ponderous with characters and bland scenes. I found myself putting it down over and over again. It was not rewarding investing the time. Yes if your wanting an intro into the Russian culture okay. A recommendation is skip the whole first section in Amercia. It serves virtually no purpose but to get you on the boat to Russian. Save yourself the time.
1,"save your money and buy THE FAIR SEX ""THE DARK AGES""","THE DARK AGES is the domestic version with allot more tracks, remastered songs with better packaging in a two cd set that is at a much better price"
1,Seller didnt even have this product!!!!!!,I bought it and 1 or two days later they emailed me saying their out of stock sounds like this has happen before to look at the ratings.
1,Very cheaply made. Moons the world when it is bent.,"Not much positive to say about this doll. Bought two for Christmas 2006 to go with the barbie doll. This is one of the cheapest-made (in a bad way) dolls I've seen. The manufacturer's skimped on the pants material (I've not figured out what the exact material *is*...it isn't cloth) to the point where if a child bends the doll (as in a bow to his princess), he moons the world. You have to constantly tug the pants up to not have a permanent er ""plumber's effect"" on this doll. It's almost obscene."
2,"Great component to have, low quality","I highly recommend you not waste your money on cables made by this company. The plugs fit very loose and fall apart. I picked these up instead of the Sony's to save $5 and am regreting it to this day. I'm not saying shouldn't get higher quality cables like S-Video or Component they're great, in fact I would recommend if you have both the S-Video and the Red, Blue, Green holes on your TV to go straight to the Component (The Red, Blue, Green) cause it makes the scanlines less noticable making the image even clearer even if it's not a HDTV plus if you do get one you'll have the right cables to get the best quality. All I'm saying is either get the ones by Sony or Monster Cable cause the Indec cables are pretty shoddy."
1,Poor quality,"This item is poorly made. The juice bottle was more stained inside than looking like actual juice. When you feed the doll the juice does nothing, it's a stain. The milk bottle had very little milk in it, maybe about 1/4 full, and when you turned the bottom up to feed the baby the milk is gone before it reaches the dolls lips. For what you get the price is just ridiculous. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Great for people who never understood the information age,"People who want to learn the big picture of the information age without digging to deep with technical details will enjoy this book. The book describes basic concepts of computers and their role in the information age. Plenty of good illustrations and the text is easy to read. Used for intro to computer science classes. However, 3 starts comes from the price vs value of content. Books that are required by schools tend to cost more."
2,A History of AT&T,"Though someone looking for a history of AT&T would be disappointed by this book, someone NOT looking for a history of AT&T may find the examples monotonous after a while (they were entertaining, but I was working on research -- I needed significant ""thought""). Aside from the fact that the content is very dated, Penzias could have turned out a much more powerful book if he had started with his ending."
5,"Wow, 2nd favorite book of all time!","This is a great book. Not a lot of the author's idea's or opinions, making this book pure and clean in it's simplicity. Composed of tremendous testimonies that leave you shaken to your core. The author of the book did a good job, but the Author of the testimonies did better."
5,West Virginia folklore,"Having recently moved near West Virginia, I decided this would be an interesting read, and it is. It reflects the author's decades-long research into the folklore of West Virginia, with lots of ghost and witch stories, superstitions and local dialect. Some readers will find of particular interest the author's account of the origin and true meaning of ""Trick or Treat"" at Halloween. The subtitle ""Folklore of the Southern Appalachians"" is surprising since everything results from research within West Virginia, which is not especially far south. Some of the sayings and superstitions are known in the Pittsburgh area and beyond."
3,the first successful pre-raphaelite poet,"whatever that is supposed to mean. the poems were, on the whole, rather weak. there are some good poems in here, ""Goblin Market"" ""Up-Hill"" and a few others. what really makes the book worthwhile is the care in putting it together. the binding is high quality, the paper is extremely high quality, the art work is beautiful. it's really a book for the eye and the touch. it's a testament to the publishers."
5,A Gershwin Night,I purchased this dvd as a gift for a family member who had been talking about this performance he saw for over 1 yr. Needless to say he was extremely happy when I gave him the dvd. I was extremely happy that I was able to find it at Amazon.com Many Thanks
5,Classical & Jazz music,"I recommend this DVD for everyone. The best fusion of Classical music with Jazz. Congratulations to Seiji Ozawa, Marcus Robert Trio and the Berlin Philharmoniker musicians. Amazon international service was perfect! I receive the DVD intact at Rio de Janeiro."
4,Inside the jury,"Very interesting to see just what the jury lived through. Their views of Peterson, the lawyers and families."
3,Interesting Jury Repercussions,"I liked this book, although, I was expecting more details. There was a fair amount of repetition of events and comments. It was interesting, though, to hear what these brave jurists had to say. I feel very bad for the repercussions serving on this trial caused. I am sure only those who have ever served on this type of trial truly understand what these courageous people are living with. Thank you all for serving.A Concerned Citizen"
4,interesting look into the jury deliberation...,"This was a quick read and an interesting look behind the scenes into the minds of the jurors that were involved in writing this book. I've read all of the Laci/Scott books and, while some of the other books about the case repeat the same information, this one stands alone. It is the only one that gives the jurors point of view and lets you take a glimpse into their thinking process that lead to the verdict and sentence. A must-read for those following the case!"
4,The Jury,I learned a lot about the case that was never in the media. It convinced me that Scott was guilty of murder. I never realized that the jurors could be so affected by the case. I was suprised that several of the jurors had received death threats due to their verdict.
4,Good insight,"I read this book in one night. Not a lot of new information on the case itself, but it was interesting reading how it affected the jurors. I am in awe of their courage in going through this ordeal."
3,Interesting from different perspective inthis case,"Interesting, learned factsnot found in other books I have read onthis case. Alot of reading was repeated, but still was a good read."
4,We The Jury,"This book shows a whole other side that the curious public doesn't catch on the ""news."" It's rather interesting to get the ""story"" from the jury's viewpoint."
1,don't waste your time nor money,"Terrible book.I followed the Scott Perterson trial, and I agree with a guilty verdict.So I thought it would be interesting to read what was going on behind those closed doors.The editing was terrible, the story was told very poorly.Names used were confusing.They had nicknames, sometimes the nickname would be written down, the other time it was not.So, who the heck are they talking about now.Don't waste time or money."
4,It was interesting,"I read everything on this trial that I could get my hands on and I thought this book to be very beneficial. It really showed how hard of a decision this was for the jury to make - as well as showing what it was like to be apart of this trial, in a sense. I very much so believe after reading this book that the jury took this decision very seriously and put a lot of thought into it. Definitely worth the read. It provided insight into the case that you can't find anywhere else."
2,A repeat of other books,"Because I had read everything I could on this case, I found this just a repeat of information I already learned. I had hoped it would give reasons, in more details of why some jurors were excused or removed."
5,Best of the lot!,"I've read all the books on the Scott Peterson trial, and this one is by far the best. Carefully researched and written in a page-turning, eye-opening style. ""We, The Jury"" was a book I couldn't put down. If you're planning on purchasing just one book on the subject, this one is definitely it!"
3,Good Read,I appreciate the jurors explaining their rational behind the verdict on the Peterson case. I also can't believe that people are STILL excusing Peterson's murderous behavior!
3,Good book - wrong verdict,"The book was interesting, but I agree with other reviewers that it is repetitive and not particularly well written. After reading ""Presumed Guilty"", I am convinced Scott P. is innocent. Not the jury's fault about the verdict, they were not presented all the information."
3,Interesting but not news,"I found this book an interesting read. However, most of the information in the book was information we already knew due to the previous books published on the case and the intense media coverage. There were a few surprises but for the most part the book covers what anyone following the case would have already known."
3,the good and evil,"Liar Liar was a great comedy, but Ed Tv wasnt. Thats why it wasnt a surprise to me that Ed Tv was costing about 6 dollars. I would recomend getting it just because they are both comedys but liar liar is better"
2,disapointment,was not worth buying on Blu-ray picture was grainy and had a yellow tinge throughout. Soundtrack was was weak thought my sub was not working. Story had promise but Will Smith buthchered it with his over the top ackting (usually works for him) Save your money and buy the standard DVD in the bargin bin at Walmart in 6 months or rent it on netflix.
2,Plodding. Boring.,"Despite an interesting cast, what must be millions of dollars worth of special effects, and a pretty good director (Peter Berg), the negligible story collapses under the weight of all of the film's other ""accoutrements."""
3,"Starts well, goes downhill fast",This has some funny bits & good scenes near the start but it starts tripping over itself and messing everything up. Not recommended.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
4,Digital copy not Mac compatible!,"What is Sony thinking? The days of treating Mac owners as second-class citizens is long over. I'm not joking when I say the resentment I feel today will be on my mind the next time I'm looking to buy, say, a TV or DVD player. All other things being equal, this silly disappointment will be the determining factor, and tip me away from the Sony brand.As for the movie, I'm rather fond of it. Deeper than other comic book hero films, it satisfied the whole of me, something that rarely happens in a ""Summer"" flick."
3,Cover Art Reveals the Big Twist,"For what purpose did they find to reveal the supposed big twist as the key art for this DVD release?!Having seen the movie in theaters only at this point, I did not see the twist coming, however as a home release I guess the suspense is now gone.I did enjoy the film for the purpose it served. Summer blockbuster fare."
2,BIG SPOILER on the Hancock Blu-ray Cover!,"For those who haven't seen the movie yet, DO NOT LOOK AT THE BLU-RAY COVER ART!!!Who approved the Blu-ray cover?? It's not just a minor spoiler, it's a MAJOR, MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!Good thing I've seen the movie already...and the movie as a whole is not that good...it was good during the first 30 minutes though."
3,Hancock,"It is an ""okay"" movie. Actually there are other Will Smith movies I liked better. But I would say that it was an okay movie."
3,The anti-hero,"For an actor that loves playing in action movies, it took a long time for Will Smith to play a superhero movie; and being Will Smith, he took an unorthodox role. Hancock is about a drunk, sloven man named Hancock who, when sober, goes about Los Angeles attempting to do superhuman tasks, though often with tragicomic results that usually destroys money, and occasionally takes innocent lives. His life changes unexpectedly when he meets a P.R. agent determined to help him improve his image, and the agent's wife, who has suprises of her own.As a movie, it has some bad language that makes it PG-13, along with the final climax which shows some blood. And there is a lot of crude humor, especially regarding our anti-hero's least favorite phrase, a-----le. The storyline itself is almost original. Overall, worth the time to watch it."
3,Entertaining...just don't think about it too much.,"The title of my review says it all.Hancock was a good movie. I watched it in HD and it has some truly cool special effects. Will Smith was pretty cool too. He portrays a Superman-ish character, but in a way that shows us how Superman would be if he were a drunk with a sorted history. Hancock genuinely tries to do good, but his alcoholism, and personal demons usually screw things up and his good deeds come with steep collateral damages.The twist is pretty cool, I think they could have explored it much better though.For me, they revealed the twist and I kept waiting for more back story which never came.That's what kept me from giving it a 4th star.Good movie, could've been much better."
3,... Something's seems missing,"Have you ever seen those cartoons where a character has a hole in it's stomach?That's how Hancock feels to me... like the movie has a big hole in the middle.I wonder if, in order to make the movie run a certain time, the director went to the editing room, and had them cut... no... CHOP... the movie down to the time he wanted...It just feels like something's missing"
3,Has potential but never gets off the ground.,"Hancock has so many good things going for it yet ultimately it disappoints. It is rushed. The movie never stays long enough on any of the mythic or complex elements that might give the movie some weight. Instead, we are whisked away from scenes before they have a chance to develop any depth or have any impact on us. We are never given the chance to connect to the characters and get sucked into their world. Despite the talented cast and an interesting story, the movie never lives up to its potential."
3,what?,"This movie stated out great. I was all excited to watch it after hearing the premise. At first I was really enjoying myself, but then the plot just started to really unravel, and there were some bad jokes. I mean, this thing with the angels is never fully explained or why it's a bad idea for two to be so close to one another - what was that? Seriously - so much potential completely ruined."
3,A mixed bag,"The Bottom Line:Hancock begins with a unique look at the superhero film but then somehow devolves into the type of boring, ordinary superhero film (complete with tedious mythology and underdeveloped villain) that it was presumably trying to satirize; frankly the only thing which I found memorable after the first half an hour was John Powell's engaging score.2.5/4"
2,Missed the mark,"The character development was really poor in this film and so was the plot. The acting and special effects were great and I think it was cast just right. However, instead of letting us get to know the characters or expanding on the plot they wasted valuable minuets on crude humor and ridiculous scenarios. I'm not sure what the difference between the unrated and the rated versions are but Netflix sent us the unrated. I hope some of the scenes were taken out for the PG13 version otherwise it is to inappropriate for kids under 17. It could have been a great movie with a little more effort put into the plot. If your home sick with the flu you may as well give it a try, but don't purposefully waste two hours of your time on it."
3,"Good start, good ending ... pity about the middle.","Hancock is two good movies that, unfortunately, are joined together so poorly, it drags both of them down as a result.Interesting for superhero fans, but probably only worth a rental."
1,BORING & STUPID,"ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF THE YEAR. IT'S SATED WITH GRATUITOUS STUPIDITY. HOW WILL SMITH CHOSE THIS RIDICULOUS MOVIE IS A MYSTERY. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SATIRE BUT WINDS UP BEING OBNOXIOUS AND CRUDE, DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN. IF THIS MOVIE WINS ANY AWARDS I'M MOVING TO SATURN!"
4,Hilarious and Awesome!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present, and I thought it was really good. Will Smith does an awesome job at playing an alcoholic superhero named Hancock who gets the job done, but he's always making a mess and costs the city a lot of money. He saves a man named Ray who wants to help him become a better superhero and make the city need him again. It was also awesome to see Daeg Faerch from Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN make a cameo as a bratty French kid named Michelle. I highly recommend HANCOCK!!!!!"
3,It's Not As Bas As All That!,"C'mon, it's a movie. For a popcorn movie, this is a fine to watch but don't expect to be thinking about how great it was the next day or telling your coworkers to go out and see it. It's just entertainment, a Hollywood Blockbuster with three very capable actors who did a very good job doing what they do.I definitely have seen worse in 2008. Let's see here...Rambo,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,Hellboy II: The Golden Army,The Dark Knight,The X-Files: I Want to Believe,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,Saw V,Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,Transporter 3,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.As the kids are so fond of saying lately, I just threw up a little bit in my mouth thinking about those horrible 2008 releases, all much worse than Hancock."
5,A lot of fun,Love Will Smith movies and this one doesn't disappoint. I've watched this movie several times in the past and still bought it.
3,not worth your time,not a good picture. some of the action was good but nothing you haven't seen before. the plot development was completely absurd. the high point of the movie is when someone gets their head shoved into someone's rectum. not award winning stuff. absolutely do not waste your time. there are millions of good movies and this ain't one. actually the premise seemed interesting -- consider a super-hero who's a drunk and a jerk but the writers obviously dropped the ball on the first down and were completely unable to breath life into the character and the film.
4,"Hancock, Can't Wait For The Sequel !!","This was an exciting, can't guess where its going movie! Kept me on the edge untill the end! Can't wait for the Sequel!!"
4,Certainly not your usual SuperHero movie,"There are so many SuperHero movies out there that to stand out you really need a unique and unusual story. That way Hancock clearly fits the bill. The special effects are good, interesting and funny too. However a lot of time particularly in the early part of the movie focusses on fewer stunts and tricks from our Hero who by that time is getting more intriguing as to whether he is actually going to be the good guy. The nice little romantic story subtly creeps in without giving away any clues of the suspense.Not exactly a superhero movie for kids.The music in the scenes, particularly when Will Smith looks at his only possessions, the movie tickets he had whenever he wakes up is beautiful.Four stars for the unusual story, concept and the effects."
3,"Entertaining, but not fabulous","I enjoyed this movie. I'll admit that I have a soft spot for Will Smith movies so I saw this one despite the bad reviews. Yes, there is way too much cursing. And lots of drinking. This is not a movie for your children. The story line was interesting, but not stellar. The special effects were awesome!One reviewer has said that this was a ""white hate"" movie, portraying whites as weak and wimpy, and blacks as strong and cool. I am white and did not pick up on that. I don't think that element is there at all, but you can decide for yourself.All in all, this was not Will Smith's best movie, but it was a fun ride anyway. I'm glad I saw it, and I'll probably be watching it again."
1,Brainless superheroe movie ever!!,"This ""movie"" is a waste of time, so stupid plot.Half superman ,half highlander the inmortal.the superheroe hollywood movies, really sucks.Don't waste your time .No more to say."
1,What makes a hero?,"When I was a kid the hero's were already good natured, clean talking, church going people already but now we get our hero's from the lowest of human kind and give them awards for their portrayals. I guess that's Hollywood, it seems only a good actor or actress are best at playing something their not. If you got this far in my review here's the real truth in making of a better human being. There's a Bible verse that says ""Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin? Can a leopard take away his spots? Answer is NO! Neither can you start doing good when you are accustomed to do evil Jeremiah 13:23; My point is nothing can give you power to change your sin nature and its making other than Jesus Christ. ""Sorry Will"" what you needed was Jesus only He makes heroes that conquer sin."
3,"Part great, part thrown together","Hancock is a film as dysfunctional as the title character. The movie starts out so promising, with humor and action in abundance. There is even depth to the title character, as he learns that for the non-superpowered, courage can be found in trying to change. He transforms from a totally self-involved character to one who comes to respect others.And then it all starts to go wrong. The major plot twist, and the hidden history of Hancock becomes a jumbled mess. The writer decide that the great premise they set up is insufficient, and they try to fuse an entirely different story into the plot.Not since Highlander 2 reframed the characters from the first film as extraterrestrials have I seen such an unnecessary and total overhaul of a fantastic premise.It was still adequate, but after the first 2/3 of the movie, the final act is a real collapse in terms of plot and development."
3,"None of the ""Will Smith"" trademark energy","I am a Will fan but I have to say that his performance in this movie left me yawning. I think he was supported well with quality co-stars but somehow, Will never defined the Character. Even after the the character got a grasp of his situation in the plot, he never ""went live"" in the way I expect Will Smith to play a part. Like with other actors of his caliber, I suppose maybe I expect more and I found him letting the movie carry his character. So in essence, Smith was sandbagging and wasn't fully invested in the part. One man's opinion. Wait for this movie to get into the $7 range before owning."
3,"Very entertaining, but not the best of Will Smith movies","Will Smith does a great job with this movie about a super hero, who does not know who he is, is a bit of a jerk, is poorly dressed and does not keep any proprieties towards strangers.All he knows is that he is super-strong. Bullets and needles do not penetrate through his skin, and has lived for quite a long time. He goes about helping others but does so in such a style that people hate him, they boo him and he, therefore, is even meaner.From the outset we see Hancock turn to alcohol to suppress his loneliness and inner hurt, but in helping a PR agent, played by Jason Bateman, he meets someone who wants to return the favor and clean up his act.The plot will surprise you at some point because there is a twist that we were not expecting. The movie is not great, but is very entertaining. Charlize Theron delivers a great performance as the wife of the PR agent."
4,SUPERHEROS,"Will Smith stars as Hancock, a down and out superhero who is forced to employ a PR expert, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), to help repair the image when the public simply isn't feeling all of his damaged during his superhero moments. Ray decides that the best way to make people realize how much Hancock means to the city is to make him openly deal with his issues as well as the many legal issues however the question remains will Hancock live up to his new image or go back to being Hancock. However, when his past is reveal to him as well as someone who has answers (Charlize Theron) who plays Ray's wife as well as share his powers but a large sacrifice has to be made.Will Smith and the team at Overbrook have done it again with Hancock while many weren't sure about the movie I have to say that Smith gave a vibrant message?Like any movie is always a message d this time I took the message as there is always someone out there for us but sometimes finding our mate isn't always the answer."
2,"Almost good, almost that is.","HANCOCK has intriguing ideas, a very appealing lead, great special effects and like just about all Will Smith movies, it manages to come up short. I also wanted to like I AM LEGEND, I ROBOT, the MEN IN BLACK movies, HITCH, etc., etc. and in all of these cases, something somehow ruined it for me. In the case of Hancock I thought the plot twist was way too much to accept and represented the first time ever I hated seeing Charlize Theron in a movie (aside from MONSTER that is).Nothing against Will Smith, I just hope someday he'll break this almost-good jinx."
5,greayt movie,This movie was really good. My children enjoyed watching it..would definitely order it again and will order from this company again...received quickly and was very pleased..thank you
3,Fun movie,"This is a fun movie, but it gets more vulgar than it needs to be. New take on super heros."
3,Online sreaming was not smooth at all,Our enjoyment of the movie was ruined by the poor picture quality. The streaming was interrupted many times. I am not sure if I would see another Amazon online movie.
2,Big Disappointment,"Hancock wound up being a Huge disappointment, mainly due to the weird story line, if you can call it a story line. It was very far fetched and pretty dumb, to put it mildly. Jason Bateman was excellent in his role of the loving, trusting husband and friend to Will Smith's character. Waste your money if you want, but if you MUST see this movie, take my advice and just rent it. You will be very glad you didn't waste your hard earned money as I did. It might have been a decent movie had the writers not twisted the plot around with Bateman's wife."
2,"Yep, great first half with a poor second","As many reviewers stated, the second half of the movie prevents this movie from becoming great.First half = 5 starsSecond half = 1 starSo, since the ending of a movie makes or breaks it, I gave this movie 2/5 stars. A decent movie to rent but definitely stay away from purchasing it."
5,Loved this movie!,"How did I miss this one the first time around? I have no idea! I am glad that I saw a bit of it on TV recently because that prompted me to buy it. (I'm glad I didn't watch enough to spoil the good parts.) If you're a Will Smith fan (or even if you're not), you will love the twists this movie has!"
4,Funny,"Not sure the writers meant it to be a comedy...maybe so. We thought it was quite funny, of course, we love Will Smith. A fun movie to watch."
1,Refund please?!,Unable to watch due to poor quality streaming. Took more time to load than the segment we were able to watch.
3,hancock movie,Movie came in way past when it said it would be here and it was in clinq wrap. The movie had smudges on it but was easily cleaned.
3,Starts off as a dark comedy and morphs into ...,"something else. Overall I enjoyed this movie, mostly because of the three lead actors (Smith, Theron, Bateman) but I thought the ""twist"" introduced about halfway through was unbelievable and added little to the movie. To be honest, I don't know how I would have wrapped it up, but it would not have been the way things actually play out. Worth watching if your expectations are not too high."
2,What a change...!!!,"This movie is odd..!!!It starts out with a bang, making you feel engaged in it. Then about halfway through it, it changes direction drastically - I won't reveal how - but unfortunately it's not for the better. The second half left me bored and somewhat frustrated with the storyline.. almost like they changed the creative staff out midway through the shooting of it.It definitely lives up to my BluRay demands on a technical level, only sad thing is, the story is so messed up...!"
3,Stupid but Cute/Funny,The begining appears to be promising; it appears Hancock suffers from a lousy narrative and execution; but it was fun/cute to watch.
5,"Hancock, the movie","Excellent shipping service; loved Will Smith and Jason Bates and Charlize Theron in this 'feel good' hero-action, romantic-comedy movie. Our family loved it!"
3,Not what I expected,The story line was spotty. The special effects were good and Will Smith played his role fairly well. The only really good portion was the last quarter of the film. It does leave you wanting more than what you got and the ending prepares the viewer for a sequel. Let's hope it has a better all around story than this film does. To wrap it all up I'd have to say that the main characters did well with what they had to work with.
3,hancock,Can anyone tell me what is the difference between the rated and unrated when both are 92 minutes?
2,"Another overblown film starring Will Smith. The high budget, low appeal actor of many expensive theatrical yawners","This is yet another, ""loud, in your face display of nothing very interesting at all!""Like many people have said: I too, was a little unsatisfied as to why Hancock and the girl are these two unique immortals with a rather weak brushed-off kind of explanation as to why they are what they are. And why did Hancock have no memory of her but she remembers everything and understands their existence better than he does. The very most important thing to know about these two, wasn't explained very well at all. But this movie does remind me of another movie where people are living with a unique cursed alternative existence from the rest of the mortal world. Remember ""Cat People?""Well, I won't be watching this film again anytime soon."
1,One of the Worst Superhero movies ever.,"I can accept a movie for what it is for, a comic book, an action thriller, a comedy, a parody, etc. This movie wasn't sure what it wants to be. Will Smith is terrible, his acting was totally bland and as though he forgot how to act or simply didn't even like his part. Parts of the movie just drag on like they wanted to save money instead of creating action. And in the end the movie contradicts its own premises on the characters. And definitely no funny parts either. Worst part is no good explanation of how things got to where they were, the few explanations that were provided were very weak.Overall a boring movie and not recommended."
2,Disappointment,My husband rented this movie for us to watch. We enjoy all the comic book hero movies so we were looking forward to this one. The beginning of the movie had potential and some parts made us laugh. Then it seems like the movie started and ended so fast. There was no build up to the climax and the ending was lame. We were very disappointed but Will Smith did make it fun. I wouldn't buy this movie.
1,"Garbage acting, script & storyline",The movie was so bad that about 30 minutes into it I started watching it in fast forward with subtitles for about 10 minutes and then just stopped watching the movie entirely because it was so boring and stupid.
3,Ehhh,The story is ok but the effects look awesome on blu-ray. I wish i rented it instead of buying :(The writing could be ALOT better.
2,Can't make up its mind,"Is is a crass movie aimed at the mindless action flick crowd? A romantic movie? Serious and depressing commentary on the human condition?Hancock tries to be all three, and pretty much fails at all of them. The trailer makes it look like an action comedy, but that's only the first part of the movie. The rest of the movie feels tacked on, and just doesn't work.If you are in the mood for the movie the trailer leads you to expect, you'll be severely disappointed. If you've never seen the trailer, you might like it better, but probably not much."
3,Average,"This movie was only mildly entertaining. It keeps you occupied during the running time, but does not entertain you. You will not have the inclination to recommend."
2,HANCOCK,"I cannot get the blu-ray to play...I have a lot of blu-ray movies from Amazon, this is the only one I cannot get to play! I have updated the software on my blu-ray player but I am still unable to get HANCOCK to play...I HEAR it's a good movie!"
3,There has to be more to a movie than this...,Too many unanswered questions in this 'summer blockbuster' that feels more like a pilot for another TV series. I suppose I'll have to wait for the countless sequels to find out who is Hancock. Great special effects made this fun and worthy of the three stars. Blu-ray dvd is awesome.
3,good first half; confusing fast second half?,I Thought that it had a good original vibe through out. The first half was really unique yet the second half was a little too confusing and went really fast...I think the reason they didn't put a lot of detail into his story was because...that wasn't the point...though the movie was funny.bottom line...5 stars for fun.3 stars for story.though this movie is still not a 4 stars more like a 3 1/2 star movie
3,5 stars for the original! 3 for the unrated...,"I enjoyed the original theatrical version of Hancock. I was disappointed when I purchased the unrated version, and the scene that was added in that made it ""unrated,"" and the part turned the movie around for me completely, so I could not watch it with my little sister! If I could've taken it back at that point for the original version, then I most definitely would've. I have yet to watch it again. Other than that, the original movie has like 5 stars from me!"
2,Mediocre at best,"Mediocre super-hero movie starring Will Smith. Special effects look like they are straight out of TV's 'Heroes', and poorly staged fight scenes really mar this movie. The premise could be an interesting one (unwilling superhero is really just a drunken bum), but it's all surface and no depth. And the ""twist"" that comes halfway into the movie was obvious from the first ten minutes."
3,"Eh. Not the best, not the worst.","I admit, there were some pretty good plot twists in here, but mainly, the story bored me. The only time the characters seemed to react believably were the times that Hancock was being a jerk and everybody was reacting to him. I didn't really feel any good chemistry between any of the characters. The action was average big movie stuff, same kind of things you see in lots of films, and although impressive, none of it blew my mind. I wasn't thrilled with this movie, but I might watch it again. Very average film."
3,"Good Movie, a different approch to the Super Hero type movies","I like this movie. I took a shot in the dark ordering this one before I watched it. Usually, I'm pretty careful with this stuff. But this one didn't disappoint."
2,Do yourself a favor and skip it.,"If you have an eye for discerning good action and special effects, you may want to stay away from this movie. Compared to say, Jon Favreau's Iron Man, Hancock's CG effects and action sequences leave a lot to be desired. It's not just the poor visual quality but also execution. Far too many cuts in rapid succession screams bad editing instead of speed and energy. Even the long shots aren't good. They're supposed to be over the top but end up looking cartoony."
3,Expecting more,"You know, I truly did not like the movie. The only reason I'm giving it a three is because I'm loyal to Smith and I can't see myself giving his work anything below average.But, yeah, the movie really was a letdown. It hasn't been the worst movie I've seen recently, not by a long shot, but the fact that I had actually expected more is where it's upsetting. There were so many holes in plot, ham acting, and an overall storyline that just had no point. I don't know. I'd write more, but I'm rather tired all of a sudden, so yeah.Bottom line: huge letdown and just an overall frivolous, no-point movie."
2,First Half was good,"The first half of the movie was good and frankly hilarious even though its mostly crude humor its when Miss AEON FLUX starts to get more screen time where it all goes downhill. It's almost as if the script were cut in half (it did have an original writer and then a re-writer) the first half an outsider story studded with crude/gross-out humor and the second an unrequitted love story with a cop-out ending. Frankly the extended dramatic scenes drug on too long and a particular humorous scene was horribly misplaced in the second half (the second hand chopping scene) buried in a high-drama ultra-serious segment. The origin of the ""heroes"" was just stupid, oh they're beings that have been referred to as angels or gods and there are only two left who by the way lose their powers and become mortal when together, super-lame.In summation 2 stars for the first half, the rest stinks don't bother; try to see this movie without having to pay for another Smith-Disaster co-starring Aeon Flux."
4,Hancock - Teenager loved it; I did too!,"Honestly, I was not expecting much, but my son wanted this movie. I was surprised at the ""surprise ending"" and the action that kept me interested the whole way through. May not go down as a classic, but definitely worth watching!"
5,Great fun!,"When I brought this home, my wife gave me ""the eye"". After a few mins. see was having a great time and laughing with me. This movie is sheer entertainment! Turn off your mind, lossen your belt & kick off your shoes. Sit back, turn off your mind and have a great time.Will Smith is a better actor than he gets credit for. The balance of the cast is very good, fit their role and work well with him. The stunts are first rate and fit into the story. Yes, their is a story of sorts. While it is more something to hang the stunts on, it fits into the action and holds the movie together.The unrated DVD is longer and the language is stronger. Their is nothing upsetting to an adult. Their isn't anything that a Jr. High Scholler has not heard either. Not for smaller kids but this is a family film for older kids."
5,great entertaqinment,"deffinitely worth watching more than once. good movie, Will Smith always delivers a good act."
2,"Meh, not very good","I'm pretty fond of Will Smith, you name of movie he's been in, and I guarantee I liked it....until now. The movie is just bad, its not even Smith's fault. Its just bad. Replace Smith with anyone and it would still be bad.I will say Will Smith sounds very unnatural swearing a lot. Every now and then when he is being sarcastic its funny. But he's not a very good jerk. The climax towards the end is good when he is actually showing sorrowful emotion, but other than that his emotions just seem forced.I'm guessing this movie sounded a lot better on paper. I wouldn't say don't watch it - because to each his own. But this is probably his worst movie to date. Yes worse than Wild Wild West...and I liked that movie :)"
1,Will Smith Worst film,"This has to one of Will Smith's worst films. His acting was poor, the story line inconsistent. Directing second rate at best. The only good thing about the movie was when it was over."
1,"Bad movie, you will be disappointed","I expected to movie to be a lot more fun and meaningful like a lot of Will Smiths movies but this one was just horrible. I was going to buy the movie but my girl rented it before could do that So glad I didnt waste my money purchasing this movie. A rent ONLY movie.Trust me, its not what you think"
1,help the economy,"Save your money people. This has got to be Will Smith's worst movie ever. The Even Stevens movie was better than this, and that movie tanked for adult audiences. The plot was very thin. The ""super-her0"" was a drunk and caused more damage than the criminals. He falls in love with the only woman he cannot have. I am not saying Will's acting is bad, just the script. He chose poorly when he accepted this role."
1,brutto,"terribile, questo film è terribile e che dire di Will Smith? talento!? forse lo ha dimostrato nella serie Il principe di Bel Air!"
1,Predictable,"I actually liked the begging of the movie but then it turned so predictable. For instance the cover of the blu-ray and some movie posters have Will Smith and Charlize Theron on out, but not Jason Bateman. Which means there is a love connection right off the bat. Second, they supposedly lose there powers when they are near each other, but Charlize Theron flies over to Hancock's house and then flies back out? Not to mention she throws Hancock and the refrigerator literally through her house while Hancock is trying to kiss her. Again, they are standing right next to each but don't lose their powers.I would have liked to have seen some ""Greatest American Hero"" moments as if he we're just beginning to learn how to use his powers OR both of them would have really died only to have their powers passed on to Charlize Theron's son. That would have been a great alternate ending."
1,sucks - every dvd player which I have five said no disc - otherwise no movie!,The disc had no movie - no disc - was the message I got on all five dvd players that I have. Sucks when one pays for something and does not get it!
4,Knives Made in the USA,"I was looking for a good set of knives and preferably made in the USA. The LamsonSharp 10 piece set arrived on time and the knives so far are very sharp and seem to hold a good sharp edge. I bought the kitchen shears separately and this was an excellent buy. The Rosewood handles are beautiful, particularly after I applied mineral oil. I didn't give this a 5-star rating because the block that comes with the set is a bit front heavy or light heavy in the back which allow the set in the block to tip forward if you are not careful. This has not been a problem, however and I would buy the set again. I did contact the manufacturer three weeks ago about the block, but have not heard back yet."
4,holy shiite!,"holy shiite! is a pretty good album by dayglo abortions. it sounds like old style dayglo, like feed us a fetus. very catchy. also there is good humor in alot of the lyrics. i would definatly recomend this cd for any dayglo fans"
4,Not too bad.,I was skeptical at first but I was suprised of the quality of the games and videos. Darker games and movies will give a little more trouble than others but other than that its good.
5,Advance Wars: The best game in the history of video games!!,Its hard but that is the fun part. The bad guy looks like my grandpa.
5,The Game With The Never-ending Replay Value!,Now I've Had This Game For About A Year Now..... And The Replay Value Still Hasn't Ended! This Game Has Somemany Unlockuble Characters It's Not EVEN FUNNY. The Fun In This Game Comes Mostly From Playing (And Squashing!) My Friends In Multiplayer Mode With The Yellow Sun Guy. I Reccommed This Game For Any GBA Owner And Strategy War Game Lover!
5,I'm stunned....,"Strategy gaming has reached an all-time high on the intensity scale. Advance Wars has just shattered the scale into a million pieces. With visually stunning graphics, insane gameplay, and mindblowing AI, this game is flat out awesome. I bought it about 6 months ago and I'm still hooked. The best feature of this game is the multiplayer. You can challenge your friends, even if they don't have a GBA or the game. Since it's turn-based, you just pass the Game Boy around and presto! A multi-player fiesta! Trust me, this is THE BEST GAME!!! If you have a GBA and don't have this game, you don't really have a GBA. On one final note: GET THIS!!!!!!!"
5,Advance Wars is Cool,"This game is simply one of the best I've seen for GBA. The difficulty yet complexity is simple enough for the most inexperienced gamer but challenging enough for a hardcore gamer. I highly recomend this game for everone, even the most casual gamer.The military units and cool battle animations are fun to watch. The multiplayer modes are also great. You have the freedom even to design your own maps."
5,Advance Wars,"Advance Wars is a great game. Its addictive, fun, and challenging. I'd say this is one of the best games for Gameboy Advance so far. I hope they come out with a sequel."
1,Advanced Wars - glitch,I purchased the advanced wars for my son who is in the hospital - the game had a glitch and it was the game that he most wanted...
3,Fun for the first 15 hours,"The game is highly addictive and the early missions are excellent. It is LONG, and after a while you will find hours have gone by and you have no recollection of what has happened.About halfway through the campaign (lots of hours) you get to build units, which ends up making the game extremely repetitive.It just degenerates into a build and shove to the front.In short, it is pretty good but lacks any deep plot or replay value. And after a few hours you will just hate the battle anims."
4,I was surprised!,"I thought this game wouldn't be that GOOD...but i was wrong! this game is great! you fight wars, and you get to build tanks, subs and planes and stuff. you have to think of how to win. this is the BEST strategy game since Starcraft. you can also link up with friends and play against the computer. i also love seeing a bunch of tanks blow up a marine [don't worry, there's no blood]. if you like turn based strategy, BUY THIS!!!!!!!"
5,An advance game for advance gamers,"WOW! This is a game that everyone needs to get thier hands on. It is the best game i've ever played in my life. its a mix between Red Alert and risk. One of the best nintendo games ever for one of the best systems ever. If you get it you will have fun Enjoy your gameboyadvance, and your Advance Wars!"
5,¡¡¡THE BEST GAME OF STRATEGY IN PORTATILE GAMES!!!!,"In all the world i never see a game like this, when you shoot a enemy tank with another tank a little damage visual and in energyin other words:is too real and for me is one of the best strategy games i playedand if you got an oportunity of buy it, BUY IT!well i played a lot of strategy games but this is in ten firstif you are an strategy player buy it at all cost."
5,A can't miss game for GBA,"This game is a great game. The gameplay is deep and complex but you get eased into it so you aren't lost. The idea itself is simple: destroy your opponent's army and take their headquarters while protecting your own. You go through all kinds of terrain and situations as you continue to defend the Orange Star nation. The are all kinds of other options too, such as multi-player with 1 cartridge for up to 4 people by link, make yor own battle fields, and even multi-player on one Gameboy Advance. ... this is definitely a must-have game."
1,Easily one of the worst games ever created!!!,"This game was terrible. I don't know why nintendo made this game. This was the worst game I ever played. Nintendo, please do not discrace yourself with another game like this. P.S. There is no action in this game. If you like action games stay away from this game."
1,BOOOOOOO,"Dont buy this game! It is horrible! The cartoons look like an ages 2 and up board game. It is ditsy, dinky, and silly. Go buy a REAl strategy game. This stinks."
4,Advance Wars,Advance wars is a good clean game with lots of strategy involved. It almost never gets boring!
4,WE were soldiers!,"At first, I was a bit irratated with the happy anime look of advance wars, but after I saw past that, the gameplay was absolutly excellant. The campaign mode is a little tiresome, but the game really shines in its Vs. Mode. You can play againts up to FOUR people or computers. And unlike many modern strategy games, this one actually has STRATEGY to it. As ill-intelligent and biased as this review may sound, play the game, I enjoyed it. Unfourtunatly tho, it does get a little boring a little quickly, but what can you do?"
4,Great Game,"As I said, this is a great game. It's fun, exciting (expecially for a stratagy game), has cool graphics, and makes you feel like a real commander. The downsides are that it gets hard realy fast, thats why I only gave it four stars, and the diologe can be downright confusing if you don't read it all carefully. Other then those few things, It's the best game I've ever played for any of the Game Boy consels"
5,Best Game for GBA!!!,"This is one of the best games ever made for GBA!!! It has won 3rd place for Best GBA Game, 3rd for the best replay value, and 3rd for best build-your-own for it's map creation (Nintendo Power Awards for 2001). My friend has this game and loves it's control and multiplayer ability! I recomend buying this awesome game!!!"
4,harder then it is fun,Advance Wars is a great game. This is a very hard game. if you can't finish the training mission this game is not for you. you'r parents probably will not like it because you will stay up till 12:00 playing. If you by this game it's worth the [money].
5,BEST STRATEGY GAME EEEEEVVVEEEERRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is so great, i don't know where to begin. This is without a doubt the deepest game i've ever played. the graphics are colorful, original, and well done. the music fits the mood perfectly. the gameplay is simple and easy to learn. i don't know what else to say except if you have any self-respect, go out and buy this game...RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Thinking bout buying this game?,"just picked up a copy of Advance Wars ..., after seeing all the hype on different sites. I'm not much of a war sim fan and am definitely not a turn-based game fan, but this game is fun. anime style graphics are neat. the game-play is easy with amazing depth. highly recommended that you go through the 14 training missions, otherwise you'll get blown away. you have to use terrain to your advantage and often, an out and out assualt is not the best path to victory. haven't tried the multi, but the 1 player game is pretty fun. neat to try out diff. strategies. for a handheld game, this is pretty amazing. best features are that you can save at anytime, allowing you to rethink your plan or get back to work. if you have the patience to learn the game it's awesome. highly recommend."
2,repetitious,"All I have heard are good things about this game but that is not what I thought. If you really like war this will probably be one of your favorites, but if not it will get really repetitious. All you do is fight war after war after war. It got very boring very quick for me. The good point is that you can build your own maps to fight wars on but you can only store up to three."
2,this one fades out like a summer romance,"Yo, I heard some really solid reviews for this game, so I went ahead and picked it up. Now I want to take it back, but I can't. The intro/tutorial mode is really good, but that is about it. Once you get past that part, the game is weak, weak, weak. Well, I'm going to target to play some good games instead."
1,Dull,"Here we go again. The so called 'great love story' of an imperious, immature man who has an outstanding sense of entitlement and his future Subjects better like it or lump it. And his immoral companion who wears the title of Mistress like a badge-it seems to run in her family. Adultery for some I suppose is something to be proud of and trumpeted before all the world. C & C deserve each other. I hope they are sent off into Royal exile if Her Majesty should pre-decease these two boring, old sinners. Bring on King William V!This book is a waste of time and money. No stars even if I was obliged by the template to give it at least one."
5,Grows On You,"Of all of The Brunettes' releases, this was the one I had the hardest time getting into. None of the tracks jumped out at me immediately the way tracks from their other releases did. But give it time, and you'll grow to love it. Without even realising it, I found all of these tracks becoming embedded in my head. Now I find myself enjoying these just as much as their other works."
3,Titles on DVD,"Apparently the February 2008 release of this set is a re-issue from the July 2007 set. I gave it a 3 star blindly as I haven't seen the set but do know St. Clair's quality in general... The titles include:White ZombieThe Human MonsterOne Body Too manyInvisible GhostThe Phantom Creeps (movie version)Death KissScared To DeathBlack DragonsThe Corpse VanishesThere is also 3 different 4-minute shorts - one a bio, one a poster gallery, and the last trailers."
4,A timely mystery that captures the essence of Cleveland.,"Les Roberts books about the adventures of PI Milan Jocovich are like a window to an old familiar place for me. I was raised in Shaker Heights, part Milan's city (Cleveland). I haven't been back in twenty years and I am pleased to still be able to reconize almost all his localities. I especially enjoyed the chase scene that took him around Cain Park to Taylor Rd., where I used to sled ride. His trips to restaurants on Kelly Hill, Little Italy, were so familiar. I wonder if a beer joint named ""The Library"", is still there?The Mystery of who killed the Serbian immigrant is all too timely. Age old hatreds don't die, even in a free country.I really enjoyed this book as well as all of Mr. Robert's Milan Mysteries."
1,Timex watches are cheap pieces of junk. Customer service is BAD!!,"Timex watches are not what they used to be. They are now cheap pieces of junk. Their customer sevice also sucks. After sending a 6 month old watch back for repair after it stopped working, they sent me back an inferior replacement that looked nothing like the original, which was at least attractive in appearance. PLUS they charged me $7.95!! Now I'm stuck with a silver watch that I have no use for (my original was gold tone). I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER TIMEX and I warn all potential buyers to beware! If you only need a watch for a day or two, then buy a Timex and then throw it away when it stops working."
4,Works great! Excellent tech support too.,"It had one drive that was not connected, but a quick call to the friendly tech support number solved that. I just had to open the case and reconnect the wires that had jiggled loose.The duplicator works just as promised. For our needs (a church duplicating sermon audio CD's) the hard drive was unneeded. So this was the perfect unit to buy. It is upgradeable - we can add 2 more drives to the enclosure if we want to. I summarized the CD duplicating steps and taped it to the top of the enclosure so our volunteer team will be able to easily make copies.The only downsides are: the big physical size/weight, the loud fans (which probably do a great job of cooling), and the clunky menu."
5,the ultimate guy toy?,"I just drove an attic-full of stuff in the back of my pickup truck from Pennsylvania to Indiana through weather fair and foul, covered by a tarp and held snugly in place with this product.This is so cool it feels almost illegal. Though I had never used tie-down straps before, I picked this four-piece pack up at Costco and found it totally obvious to use. The straps themselves are very long so I had plenty to spare. The ratchet gizmo winches the straps tight with almost no effort.From here I can glimpse the demise of the bungy chord.I can't stop saying 'This is so cool'.I can't wait to use'em again."
5,Running can be fun again!!,"I am a triathlete, and as such I am always searching for ways to increase both my endurance and my enjoyment of excersize. Joe Henderson, not only makes reading about running fun but offers some unique and worthwhile suggestions for even the serious athlete.Hey if it isn't still fun to run then read this book and follow his advice. Before long you will wonder why did not think to make these changes earlier and save yourself some unproductive pain.Also, many of these lessons transfer nicely into other sports so do not be afraid to try them out."
2,Inconsistencies hurt any useful data,"This isn't it what it says. It's mostly reprints of Henderson's columns from Runner's World and other periodicals. As such, it's a good picture of his outlook, warts and all. Unfortunately, it's not as cohesive a perspective as it would be if it were a complete work. Henderson contradicts himself several times, and gives some genuinely bad advice, like training for marathons by running no more than half the distance (even he admits to barely finishing with this approach -- imagine what it would do to a novice!), and drinking soda or sugar water during endurance runs (this can be downright dangerous).What good information there is to be had here is mostly quoted from Sheehan, Galloway, and others. This gives a good overview of some of the primary sources, but it's marred by Henderson's inconsistency and his obvious ego."
2,At Weddings and Wakes was superior,"The award for this book, perhaps, works better if I think of it as a way to reward Alice McDermott for her overall achievements. But At Weddings and Wakes was far superior. And I can't recall when the subject of That Night has been done better. I think the awards committee missed the better books."
3,"All Technique, No Texture","The unusual point of view: absolutely magnificent. Language (word choice): marvelous. Repetition: mystical.Content, story, plot, characterization: mediocre."
2,Unexpected Disappointment,"After reading the first chapter at this web site I purchased the book. I was disappointed with what followed. The character development of Billy was poor, as was the author's explaination of why he was obsessed with a woman he barley knew. Are we to believe that the loss from a short-lived superficial relationship, is supposed to burden us the rest of our lives? How absurd!! As for the narrative style, the author needs to study Somerset Maugham."
5,Brillantly written.,"Yet another success for the wonderful goddess of litarature, Alice McDermott. This story weaves a facinating tale. A captivating novel good for people of all ages. I strongly reccomend this book to anyone who thinks himself to be an intellectual individual"
4,top notch novel--don't be put off by ornery reviews,"CHARMING BILLY (the title's from the song) is a top notch novel. It is a modernist work and therefore perhaps not suited for those who want a more straightforward read. But the prose is lyrical (by the way, those weren't dangling modifers) and the characterization moving. The narrator, who is revealed within the first few chapters, is trying to put Billy's story together; consequently we never quite get to the heart of Billy, any more than we do to the hearts of other people in real life. Ultimately, this is a book about Mystery,"
4,Classic Alice McDermott!,"Alice McDermott is the author of one of my all-time favorite books, At Weddings and Wakes. I didn't love this book the same way, but it is very good all the same. Anyone who is from an urban Irish- American background must read her books - you will recognize her characters as people straight out of your lives. Her working class New York neighborhoods echo the Boston that I grew up in, and reading her books is like revisiting my childhood. Don't read this book if you are looking for romance or excitement. Alice McDermott's books are in a class of their own."
4,Not one of Alice McDermott's best works,"The strong opening was effective and griping. Yet the pace was not maintained throughout the book. However, any one with a history of alcoholism in their family will identify with the book."
1,"Well-crafted, but empty","The emptiness of the characters spills over into the essence of the book. And I don't think this is intentional. When James Joyce, the ultimate exemplar of the Irish story, wanted us to feel the emotional chill of his characters' situations, as in ""The Dead,"" the chill was exquisite. I grew up in this territory. And while the characters are realistic, they are no more than that."
2,Hard to stay focused,"This book did an excellent job of capturing the Irish experience in the U.S. during the 20th century. I appreciate the eloquent way the author framed an otherwise dull story against an exemplary backdrop. However, accuracy isn't everything, and the plot just never took off. The problem was not so much the story, but the writing was cyclical and tangential. At times, the reader can't tell who the narrator is. My friends of an Irish-Catholic background loved it. I can only appreciate McDermott's ability to paint the picture. I just wish that picture had managed to capture me."
2,Have you been with someone who drops names you don't know?,"Alice McDermott does write beautiful pros but leaves many of readers, especially the non-Irish, out of the party when she expects them to know all the characters and time frames. I thought rereading the book would make them clear but didn't help much. Of course, I didn't bond with James Joyce either."
2,Uninteresting,This book is uninteresting and dull. I had to force myself to read the entire thing hoping it would get better.
1,Endless tedium,"Tedious, exasperating and contrived ... are three words to describe this book. This story just drags on and on to a phony ending. Leave it in the shop!"
2,Where's the Charm?,"The committee which awarded the prize for this book must have been in Ireland, under the influence, for this book certainly deserves no prize. Billy is not charming, but a user of people. His friends and relations are not forgiving, but co-dependents in his alcoholic stagger through life. Alice McDermott's prose, while occasionally pretty, is never deep. It's time to leave our fascination with the Irish and move on to another nationality."
3,Lovely final chapter....,"McDermott clearly has a way with the language, and much of her writing is a pleasure to read. The final chapter, in which the father and daughter go to the beach house, is especially well done. But, in the end, the writing is obscured by what seems to be an unnessarily confusing style. Artists should challenge themselves and their audience (just imagine a web site like this in which people reviewed modern art: Picasso sure would catch heck! Doesn't he know where to put the eyes?!), so I don't really fault her for writing the book as she did. But I would have liked to have seen more fully realized characters, instead of the handsome Irish drunk and his martyred wife. These people never came alive enough for me to really, truly care about them. But I'm not sorry I read the book."
1,No Charm In Billy,"This book was a major disappointment for me. I felt suffocated by its characters and story and had little sympathy for Billy, who seemed to be totally self-indulgent and self-destructive. Even though the book was short, it felt like War and Peace as I tried to plow through it because I was enticed by the raving reviews and its National Book Award status. But it was tedious, annoying, and, ultimately, unrewarding."
4,Quiet book,"A quiet, reflective story about an alcoholic man's death. His friends and family reminisce, and whispered voices are heard from the past. I liked the way this book was written. 'Quiet' is the best way to put it. Read it!"
2,Boring!,I purchased Charming Billy because I was under the impression that a book had to be good in order to get an award. That is definetely not the case with this book. The story has no plot and goes no where. You are told the fate of the man at the very beginning and the book doesn't get anymore interesting from there. Don't bother reading it. There are too many wonderful works of literature out there to waste time with such a boring book!
3,There was not enough story in the story.,"I liked McDermott's characters (though a bit stereotypical). I thought her descriptions were beautiful, her prose flawless...I started out loving the book. But it really went nowhere. I kept expecting some climax, some reason to tell this tale. Yet, I found none! It seemed to me to have no greater purpose than the idea that when reality clashes with your ideals you live your life the best you can. Billy didn't have the life he wanted but this was how he got through it."
2,Very depressing from cover to cover.,I've always had a secret desire to be Irish - Charming Billy squashed all of that urge. What? Nearly 300 pages of one miserable anecdote after another. A waste of my time and good humor. MWY
5,Wonderfully Familiar Characters,Ms. McDermott writes beautifully and with such poetry about such ordinary people. It was a pleasure to look into these familiar character's lives. It is a great book.
5,This book reads the way life feels,"Alice McDermott has a genius for capturing the telling detail in every scene she describes, so that everything seems both recognizable and seen for the first time. The novel is masterful in conveying the quality of memory and of the mysteries that exist in all families - mysteries that everyone has an opinion on but that can never be finally resolved. How wonderful to read a book in which there are no heroes or villains - just people like the ones we know, occasionally elevated by their dreams or their loyalties or their sense of humor, then sunk by their weaknesses; and what a pleasure to read a book in which relationships within family and neighborhood are central without being the crux of some hideous abuse that explains everything. In life, and in Charming Billy, no one thing explains everything."
2,I don't think this deserved the National Book Award,"I'm sorry, but I don't think this novel deserved the National Book Award. I loved Cold Mountain (last year's winner), but I think there are far better books that could have won this award. The story did not move me in any way. I don't care how good the writing may be, if the story does not change my view of the world in some way or stir emotion in me, or even entertain in some way, then what's the purpose of reading it? I know this author is talented, but I wanted more."
3,"Difficult reading, but interesting observations","The book is difficult reading. The characters are not formally introduced and the story skips about in time. The prose requires a lot of concentration. However, it does address interesting themes about relationships, life's experiences, and alcoholism."
4,"Quite charming,...","The book is good. That's what I have to say. It contains a very light story for light reading and a historical sense into the Irish families. The plot set in such well mannered it was depicting a soft dying day where Maeve is hard on finding her future. When Billy died, she was so devastated and the loomy days where described in up-miost excellence, as beautiful and as mundane as a dying day.What I feel in this book is a sense of belonging. The narration really put me there, just like a person beside with much to listen on their little conversations. The book show the courage and the pain and the lost. But it ends well, with new hope. THANK YOU Alice."
2,"poetic language, weak characterization & plot","I was disappointed in this book. I share the northeast, Irish American background described in the novel, but didn't find the characterizations especially compelling. The plot would have been ok for a short story but just doesn't hold up in a novel. Also, there is a tradeoff between this modern, ""in"" style and simple clarity -- I suppose I generally prefer clarity! Some of the passages are very poetic, however. I can see how some folks would enjoy this, but it's definitely not my cup of tea."
1,"Alice, learn how to write!","Don't know why this was award-winning. Hard to follow, too many loose phrases. Her writing style bothered me so much that I had a hard time really getting into the book. Kept expecting it to get better...it didn't. Don't bother..."
1,IT's not what you think! (Don't be fooled),"I read the novel Charming Billy, for my sophmore honors english class, and in anonymous vote, we agreed that this book was not good at all. McDermot, tried to make the novel to complex, when it didn't need to be. All the characters weren't necessary. I'm not saying that I wouldn't read another one of her novels, because I believe that everyone deserves a second chance."
4,"A confusing, although redeemable, realistic story","A glimpse into the lives of people all of us have probably met, especially vivid if you grew up during the time and in the locale in which CHARMING BILLY takes place. Whether or not you agree with their decisions, characters like Billy, Dennis and Eva do exist, however pathetic, paternalistic, and selfish they may (respectively) appear. Aside from a few confusing instances when the narration compels you to flip back to check about what exactly is being discussed, McDermott's lyrical prose flows. On the surface BILLY is a simple story, especially because most of the tragic events are revealed early. Only after you have finished the book and stepped back to reflect do you appreciate the value of its messages. This is proof of the author's style in that she successfully maintains her reader's interest."
3,Boring,"This book was very well written. It captured the mediocrity of a middle class, Irish-American family perfectly. The problem I had with it was that I never felt any emotion towards the characters. They were all mundane as was their life story."
3,Well written characters came alive to me,"This felt like a long short story - I read the whole thing on a plane. It made me laugh and cry, the characters were interesting and I cared about them. The action takes place over roughly 24 hours - you learn about Billy's life through the eyes of those who knew him. What a refreshing way to tell a story."
2,I found this book very disappointing.,"I found myself bored and annoyed with this book. Billy was anything but charming. He was a self-centered and self-absorbed alcoholic. The characters were all one-dimensional. I had a difficult time empathizing with any of them. I would have liked to know more about Billy and Mauve's relationship, more about what Billy thought and felt. The non-linear time frame, in my opinion, did not enhance the story, it made it more difficult to follow. All in all, this book did not resonate with me."
4,Irish reminiscences,"After reading many comments, I am wondering if you have to be an Irish American New Yorker to appreciate this book. Yes, I was confused at times, but either looked back, as I often do, or went on, and then I saw what the author was getting to. I found this book heartwarming to the end, where Dennis and Maevis, two people who have lost something in their lives, come together. I was so happy for them. Having spent much of my early childhood in NY, I connect with many of the characters and places used here. There is much sadness, but it is real, and there is a happy ending, I think. I recommend it!"
4,reminiscent of my family home,"I enjoyed this story, as it reminded me of my own family, and spending my childhood on Long Island. The names were all to familiar and the places too. I had a warm feeling when reading this. I do wish that the narrator had explained more about herself a bit earlier, as I was confused about her role in the whole story. I did enjoy it very much."
1,Less than Charming Billy,"At first I really cared about the main character, Billy, but as the book plodded along I found myself caring less and less about this stereotype of an Irish-American. I cared even less about about his ever-suffering, saint-seeking, co-dependant wife, Maeve. This book was confusing, dull. Like the previous reader said, ""who gives these awards?"" I was sorely dissapointed."
1,What were the National Book Award people thinking?,"This book is like a cheap version of Angela'a Ashes. The book is hard to follow and not worth the time. Fortunately and mercifully, it is short."
2,This book was boring,I thought about returning this to Amazon; but decided it was my choice. Why would anyone want to read about a funeral and all the dreay stuff that goes along with the family. I read for comfort and relaxation and to be entertained. Not this time
4,"Studious, thoughtful, well-composed","I genuinely pity any readers baffled by Charming Billy's careful shuttling back and forth through varied decades and points of view. This particular technique is what art, especially literary art, is primed to do (see Conrad and Faulkner, McDermott's key influences in this regard)...but as always, there are none so blind as those who will not see. The novel is sad, thoughtful, openminded and even majestically calm, qualities all reflected in its prose. That said, Charming Billy is not flawless, as witness Billy's too-pat (no Irish pun intended) encounter in Ireland with you-know-who, and the book must ultimately take a back seat to *At Weddings and Wakes*, McDermott's masterpiece. I praise Charming Billy with faint damns."
5,A book of depth,"I echo the other favorable reviews in terms of the writing, the unfolding of the story line - which Amazon's synopsis destroys, by the way and should be removed - and the masterful character development. The point I'd like to add is that although I read this book when it was first printed years ago, I got chills and just a bit weepy in a sweet way from only reading ABOUT the book here, where I came to purchase a copy for a friend. The story and characters truly have stayed with me in a powerful way for all these years. What an unexpected treat this book was. I wish I'd never read before it so I could 'find' it again..."
2,"It's not as ""Charming"" as the title leads us to believe...","I chose to read Charming Billy in my twelfth-grade Contemporary Literature English class. I do not see what people like about this book. I found it to be rather boring and uneventful, not to mention confusing. This entire book is based off of Billy, a drunk who passed away. The narrarator is Billy's cousin's daughter. Her purpose is to relay Billy's life to the readers. I saw no moral or lesson in Charming Billy and was rather disspointed. I would have much rather put my time and energy into reading a more interesting book with a lesson that would have some impact on my life. I hope I helped in your book-reading decision."
2,Maybe I just wasn't in the mood -,"So, it's a few weeks before Christmas. I sat down to read Charming Billy and just couldn't get into it as much as I'd hope. I love to read and figured this book would be a good one. Maybe, just maybe, my mind is preoccupied with Christmas frenzy stuff? I thought the book more or less predictable. It is hard for me learn to love a character that is a drunk. All these charming little tales of Billy - but how much havoc ran rampant with his family and friends due to his drinking? It's hard for me to be compassionate here."
1,I can't believe this book won an award.,What a boring and confusing book. I have read hundreds of books and this was one of the worst. I am glad I got it from the library and did not purchase it. There are so many wonderful books to read I wouldn't waste my time on this one.
3,Charmingly Boring,"Oh, swoon. A poor drunk named Billy Lynch dies and his family recants his life, from his midnight drunken stumblings to his tragic love affair. Isn't it romantic? NO, it's BORING!!!!!!! Indefinitely destined to put a hyperactive 3 year old insomniac to sleep. I really wanted to love Billy and his neice, the narrarator, but I kept finding myself hoping someone would be murdered or discover their mother is really their sister. In the end, nothing happens - Billy dies and everyone's sad. The End."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I tried and tried to read this book but kept going to sleep, finally gave up and moved on with my life. The sameness of it all was overwhelming. From reading the other reviews I guess the only hope for enjoyment is if one is from New York and I am not."
1,Maybe It Helps To Be Irish,"Seemingly endless blather about a self-pitying alcholic and his dishonest friend. Interesting use of narrator to create a patchwork quilt of a story which jumps around quite a bit, going off on tangents and then looping back to pick up threads left hanging. I would imagine that this novel may deeply affect those who can recognize some of themselves or their family here, but for those who do not come from this background the motivations are difficult to follow, much less understand. Some great psychological insights but they do not weave together into a cohesive whole, but rather seem like little gems sparkling in the muck. McDermott can write well but in the end I asked myself, ""Who cares?"""
2,Sad lot,"A little lesson on the affects of betrayed love. It was overall ok. Nicely written, but I didn't really feel a solid connection to the storyline or the characters."
1,boring,I do not understand how this book could have won an award. I found it dull and very slow. I forced myself to finish this book which took me what seems like an eternity. Do not waste your time or money on this one.
2,National Book Award?,I bought this book because I happened to see an interview with the author after she had just won the National Book Award. I totally agree with Reader from Vermont who thought that this was hardly worth the award. Go read Wally Lamb!
3,You gotta be from New York...,"Charming Billy by Alice McDermottI read this book because (a) Alice McDermott's son was attending the same high school as my son and I thought if I ran into her, I would like to have read her book. (b) It won a critical award (The National Book Award? The Pulitizer? I don't remember) and (c) because my husband loved it. My husband is from New York; that must explain it. It was beautifully written; that explains (b). I never ran into her. I was vaguely depressed by the story, but not involved enough to care."
1,It stinks,"Ummm. this book is a waste of time to read. Unless you have about 20 hours of fre time to interpret this book and anyalize every page, go for it, but it is reall not worth your time. It is confusing and irrevelant."
2,I was disappointed with this book.,"Reading Frank McCourt's 'Angela's Ashes' may have created an unreasonable expectation that somehow tragedy can be compensated for by humor, and I somehow wanted this book to be funny, but it wasn't (although it probably wasn't intended to be). From my perspective, this book had neither a compelling plot nor a gripping tone. I was often confused about who was talking (though I knew it was Billy's niece) and who exactly the various relatives were. The book just didn't hold together for me."
2,The story is highly repetitive and sticks to one alcoholic.,"The book won the National Book Award in 1998 which stimulated my interest in reading it. I was disappointed with the theme, the death of an alcoholic. The life of the protagonist (if you can call him such) was a dreary life in a bottle. Why he was called ""charming"" is beyond me. The book is well written, which helps since the story is highly repetitive. The poor characters loved a man who did not love himself. Did he really drown his life in alcohol because of a broken heart? It seems highly unlikely yet little is known about the character. I was most disappointed."
1,This novel is a mockery of itself,"This novel incorporates in its characters nearly every Irish stereotype imaginable! (surely the author is aware of this, but why this vulgarity?) No doubt, there is something aesthetically pleasing in the prose, but this is quickly sapped by its poorly devised characters who become an inescapable weight of incredulity that deafens the novel. As for the 'love' in this romance- it is quite strong, because alcohol is probably the most 'charming' thing Billy comes to find as a true love. Yet, another drag on our poor reader is that Billy isn't a even a 'fun' drinker; so it seems like more desperate measures would have been taken sooner to intervene. Surprisingly, friends and family continue supporting this deadbeat . . . because they love him! But does he love them? Does he care? And more to the point, does the reader care after this painful journey to reach the last page? At this point the novel has lost any perceived charm (if there ever really even was)."
3,"If you can follow it, this book is good","I have to agree with some of the others who reviewed this book when they say the narration is very hard to follow. It is. Not only does the point of view skip around, but I feel like Ms. McDermott moves on to a new time period before she has really finished with the current time period. However, the prose is beautiful and the characters well-developed.I'm willing to wade through some of the problems in the narration for interesting characters."
4,Loved it,"A charming, poignant story of interwoven family characters, each with their own viewpoint regarding one specific family member. They discuss his impact on their lives and in the process let us see into each of their lives, as well.Particularly moving if you understand big city neighborhoods and the ethnic groups that evolved there, especially those established during the last century.Not a lot of action, but real insight into the bonds of family and friend comraderies."
4,Recommend it!,"I have recommended this bookto numerous friends and family. I grew up in this neighborhood, and I knew quite a few Uncle Billys. Hard working, well meaning, mild mannered, kindly sorts - as we used to say ""poor unfortunates."" He harmed himself more than anyone else. This book and its characters hit home. I felt as if I knew most of them."
2,"Too much pathos, not enough charm","This book tried to do what ""Angela'a Ashes"" actually did. There were too many characters with too much pain in their lives to allow the reader to identify with any single one. The strange choice of narrator futher clouded the novel. McDermott does a fine job of placing a word on a page; her prose is melodic and rich to read. But when those words try to become a story, they fall short. I found very little believable threads in this book and would not recommend it."
3,A character study through the eyes of a burdened family,"Alice McDermott crafts a thoughtful eulogy to the sad earthly existence of the nararrator's Uncle Billy, a sweet, mannered alcoholic resigned to life without true love. The plot structure is challenging to read in that it continually jumps from time period to time period and first to third person in its attempt to provide a full analysis of the beligered Billy. As family members comment on their lifelong experiences with the decedent at Billy's funeral, you get the feeling that he caused more grief in their lives than the narrator (Billy's niece) is willing to admit or understand. However, the book does provide a realistic and plausible confirmation that true love does exist even in this chaotic and burdensome world we live in."
1,Once you get over the hurdle...,"Ms. McDermott writes beautiful prose. She knows how to capture a character at a vulnerable moment; and this is reason enough to read all the way through. Having said that, the clinically terminal problem with this skimpy book is that its central premise is patently unbelievable! Thirty years and we're supposed to believe that no one--not even the Irish relatives--give bugwit Billy a clue as to what really happened? Perhaps Ms. McDermott lavishes so much effort on her prose because she knows her plot is idiotic. Add to this gaping defect the author's oh-so-subtle insistence that nothing makes any difference in life anyway (so, why not be stupid??) and you find Ms. McDermott's book is a cheat in the end, and rather a cowardly one. So many better authors and stories affirm the opposite, i.e, William Trevor, Maeve Bunchy, Alice Munroe. Here's hoping the author got this nonsense out of her system and will deliver something major soon."
3,"Poor, poor willy",it was OK.It was a typical story about a drunk with family who are affected. How a drunk might forget his or her commitment to people no longer close by.
1,So hard to follow--,"I am on page 42 and I just realized from reading another review who the narrator is. I was enthusiastic about reading this book, and now I am very disappointed. I am trying to get through the rest, but the writing is boring, the characters are boring, etc., etc., etc."
4,A lovely read,"I'm so surprised to read the negative comments. I thought this was a wonderful book about love, friendship and family. I was completely wrapped up in the characters and the delightful prose, and finished it in a weekend."
2,About the audio version...,"I rented the tape to fill the hours of a car trip. I struggled through two tapes of five then put them away. The reader has the most awful voice and the worst phony Irish accent. I may try the book itself so I can give the characters and narrator the voices I choose, but it's not high on my list. I have not been grabbed by the this book; I really don't much care what happens to anyone I have been introduced to so far."
3,OK,"I really felt like quitting in the middle of this book b/c I just couldn't get into it but I trudged on and finally read a few chapters in a quiet place w/ no distractions and I began to like the book and I'm glad I finished it. It is a very sad story - but this may be lost on you b/c the writing can be very confusing if you are not totally focused on the book (like if you're reading on a train or bus, etc) so you may have to re-read a page or two if you find yourself thinking 'what is she talking about?'. Also, the way the older characters spoke seemed to be more Irish than Irish-American and this was annoying for me because I had to keep trying to imagine them without accents and I just couldn't. I don't think it deserved an award, but despite all this I liked it anyway."
2,National Book Award? Why?,"I looked forward to reading ""Charming Billy"" because I like McDermott, and I was delighted that she'd won the National Book Award. Perhaps I began with too positive an attitude because it wasn't long before I was thinking ""Why the award? What is fresh about this story?"" The most compelling part of the book occurs when Billy returns to Ireland and unexpectedly meets his 60-year-old love, a scenario that McDermott never really develops. Did I think Billy was charming? No! He was an unpleasant, self-centered alcoholic. I can't imagine why all these people felt such a stupendous loss when he died. (And maybe that's the point: he fooled them all.) My monthly book club met as I was finishing the book, and several of us had read it. No one felt the book was worth recommeding to those who hadn't. Still, the question remains, what have we missed that the National Book Award Committee saw?"
2,dull story about ordinary people,"I looked forward to reading this book because it got the National Book award. What a disappointment! For some reason the author made it difficult to figure out relationships between and among the different characters. That puts an unnecessary burden on the reader. Once again in a work of fiction the Irish are made to look bad. Here the girl who left Billy, never to return, turns out to be a selfish person who keeps the money he sent for her return and uses it for her own purposes. At least this book has a happy ending. But I could not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good book."
2,Interesting premise uninterestingly explored,"The whole time I was reading this, I kept thinking of other writers who could have made this an interesting story. The events, what few there are, unfold in an uninspired way, the character development is non-existent. I stayed with it to the end, thinking the writer had some intention of turning the tables on us or making the story suddenly reverberate with new meaning -- no such luck. It was what it was -- repetitive and dull. The idea, however -- a man who nurses a lost love his entire life only to discover that his loyalty to the dead one has been based on a big lie -- it could have been worth reading. Pity that it wasn't."
5,A totally enchanting novel of enduring love!,Charming Billy is a remarkable book that is worth everyone's time to sit and read. It portrays Irish-Catholic culture in a way that will not be forgotten. I read the novel before it became a National Book Award winner and I had a feeling it was destined for acclaim.
3,Well written but not compelling,"Alice McDermott is a fine writer but I'm not sure she deserved an award for this particular book. I was not pulled into the narrative until about two-thirds of the way through. And I, too, found it hard to keep track of the characters. A major relationship is not revealed until halfway through the book. I didn't realize whom the narrator was addressing until near the end. The fact that the book isn't always narrated by the narrator doesn't help. Definitely worth reading but not entirely satisfying."
5,Wonderful,"What a wonderful reading journey Alice McDermott provides for her readers with her newest book Charming Billy. As she did in both That Night and At Weddings and Wakes, McDermott entrances and intrigues her readers to quickly turn the pages. This book reels you in from the first page and doesn't let go. Wonderful characters who remain with the reader even after they've finished the book."
1,One of the most overrated books that I have ever read,"When I first saw this book in the store, I thought that it looked great....little did I know what was lurking inside of the cover. When I read Charming Billy, I did not find what I had hoped. What I found was a long-winded, depressing, confusing and highly uninteresting piece of literature. In short, I do not recommend this book."
2,Boring Billy,"Like others, I read this novel because of the National Book Award accolades. McDermott's novel is entertaining and at times insightful, but it is rarely profound. I found myself skipping pages of text because I was not engaged in the plot or the characters' lives, and in the end, the story seemed to me like one-dimensional musings of life and life's unfulfilled dreams. ""Charming Billy"" is like a mediocre ""Big Chill,"" and one wonders how it merited the National Book Award for fiction. While McDermott's writing is polished and mature, she fails to transcend the reminiscences of her characters to afford the reader perceptive or discerning truths about life. In the end, the novel failed to involve me and was quickly forgetten. It was, in a word, charming."
2,This One's a Snoozer,"I was sure this book would be engrossing since it received awards and has been listed on reading lists for several years. Boy was I wrong. The only reason I even finished it is because I kept thinking surely it would get better. The narrator kept alluding to relationships that never really materialized in the novel. My advice: pass on this one, there are too many great books in this world to spend your time here."
1,It has stayed with me as the worst book ever after years.,"This one continues to ring out as most memorable worst book. It drags. It is deliberatley complicated and if there are points they are most definitely lost in the poor writing that does not flow. I enjoy reading different writing styles and though they do not all flow into a fast read all of the time, most books ebb and flow. This one just ebbed painfully. I am afraid it has made me cautious of grabbing just any National book award winner and expecting a good read. Someone missed the boat when voting on this one."
2,Disjointed characters and plot.,"There are so many characters, none of which we get to know very well except the deceased Billy, and even he is only a casual acquaintance. The book takes many sidetrips, flashbacks, and the relationship between some of the characters is never really clear. All in all, an uninteresting book which takes too much effort to read."
2,Not a prize winner,"McDermott failed to portray the characters of the book in a way that held my interest. It was extremely difficult to latch on to the story or it's characters as McDermott failed to let us spend more than two pages on one character! I found the content and construct of the book excessively boring. I never fail to find pleasure in all books I read, however, Charming Billy was the first."
3,"fine book, BUT","I liked this book. Wonderful unhackneyed prose, touching and lugubrious tone, BUT I found it difficult to keep track of the numerous characters. Why don't authors include a cast of characters up front the way playwrights often do and a map to orient us to the locale??"
3,Disappointed in this award-winner,"I'll read just about anything that wins a major literary award but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers - why did this win the National Book Award? There was very little that I could say that was likable about most of the characters. I also found the jumping from one era to another a bit frustrating. Nevertheless, the prose and the attention to detail were what got me through this tale."
3,Not-So-Charming,"McDermott is a skillful writer and weaves thoughtful plots with substance. However, Charming Billy seems to create a massive void between reader and character(s)...there was such distance between me and the story...I did not quite believe the caricature snapshots of how wonderfully charming Billy was...after all, he was drunk most of the time. AFter 30 years of drinking and allowing alcohol to become the most hotly pursued thing in one's life, I think the charm has probably worn off a bit(at least in the real world). I enjoyed the Irish Catholic humor, the narration for the most part, and the ironies. But just when I got a bit comfortable and enjoyed getting to know a character, McDermott switched voices, characters, and created a frustrating read.I gave it 3 stars for the authentic effort, and McDermott's play on words. For the most part, it just ""didn't work."""
3,Somewhere in the middle,"I did not hate this book like many readers did. On the other hand, I do not understand those readers who rhapsodized over McDermott's style of writing. I remember a teacher told us once that if the reader is confused, it is the writer's fault. I thought her style more confusing than poetic. Still, I felt it was a good story and I found Billy to be charming and tragic...For all the confusing prose, Billy was worth it..."
3,Confusing and Tragic,"Again, this was a book that I would not have read if I was to pick it on my own sheer will. I read it for a writing group, and can not figure out why this book was chosen. The characters were unclear, the scenes flip flopping without warning and sometimes I was not aware that things changed until several paragraphs later. The reader is constantly being forced back and forth from present day to reminisces of days gone by without clearly seeing them come (or go!). And most off, it took quite a bit of time for me to realize that the narrator was a woman. We never even learn her name.Despite this, the driving force to keep reading was to learn more about how Billy coped with the loss of Eva, the love of his younger drinking years. And as a bonus, this book did not focus solely on how rotton drunks are, but rather conveyed how tragic it is that they fall victim to it."
4,Character Study,"If you are interested in character-driven stories that unfold a little at a time, you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for a plot-driven tale, look elsewhere. The language and the imagery in Charming Billy is superb. The patient reader will not only mourn the loss of Billy, but also the loss of the other characters after turning the last page."
2,A Good Idea That Desperately Needed To Be Workshopped,"""Charming Billy"" isn't the worst book I read all year, it's just the worst award-winning one. And that alone is worth an extra star. The writing is fine in places but, as many others have already said, is so hard to follow as to render it meaningless. Also, I had a major problem with how the narrator (Dennis' daughter) came upon some of the information she was now telling us. I won't give away the plot or any surprises but when reading it, ask yourself how she possibly could have known about certain events in the past? Unless I'm missing something, it was physically impossible for her to know some of what went on while Billy was away. It's hard to believe that such a fundamental mistake could have passed by an editor. Or, maybe it's not. And that's too bad."
2,Redundant bore that had a promising beginning.....,"This novel started out beautifully, with writing that made my heart ache. And then, boom, it bombed around page 80. This would have been a GREAT short story. MacDermott's character descriptions were SO repetitive, and the scene in the gas station in Ireland with the bullsh-t about the two sisters having an argument was absolutely ludicrous. After all that pining for Eva, Billy acts completely alien to his own character during this whole scene."
3,Certain Chapters Pure Delight,"I became interested in this book after the National Book Award. I certainly can recommend certain chapters - Billy's trip to Ireland (and Eva) and Billy and Eva's first summer meeting. In terms of the whole novel, however, I didn't feel much connection with the characters. Perhaps because we do not really get to know the narrator (perhaps that would be a great sequel or prequel?)"
3,Very readable -- recommend it highly!,"An avid reader of Alice McDermott's previous books, I loved this one as it took me back to my childhood days when the Irish tales were told and retold, always with a touch of mystery - or the knowledge that when one got older one would finally find out those un- spoken family secrets! Also, it took me back to summers on Long Island when first loves came to pass with those wonderful . oh so brief days and nights by the glorious Atlantic ocean!!! Those who lived both in the Irish culture and the time period of this novel most certainly are in for a treat -- while those who are younger should appreciate the beautiful descriptive writing of the author. and nights --"
1,Charming Billy is more chore than charm.,I have just this moment finished reading Charming Billy. I am so relieved to shut the cover for the final time. Any one interested in reading this book needs to go to page 243 and read the sentence near the bottom that continues on to page 244. It consists of 180 words and 12 commas. This is but a small taste of the grueling style of writing this book contains. I did not shed one tear over any character in this book. A book that seemed to never end. There are so many better choices for the National Book Award Winner. So many better choices for reading material period. Think long and hard before purchasing this book. If you must read it look for it at your local library.
2,Maybe there was something I missed.,I wanted to like this book. I had read the reviews and liked other books Alice McDermott has written. This book seemed to go nowhere. Billy was a drunk with a codependant wife. End of story. I wanted something more to happen when Billy met Eva again in Ireland. I stuck with it to the end but wish I hadn't.
3,"The book was ok, but not award winning material","I enjoyed the opening chapter, dinner after the funeral, for its insightfullness. The comments about Billy and the widow Meave brought back memories and provided insights about thier lives.However, I quickly got lost."
3,evocative prose within a confusing structure,"While there is some beautiful writing in this book - especially the sections when Billy and Dennis spent a summer in the Hamptons and Billy first met Eva, the love of his life, I don't think this book deserves the accolades it has received. My main reason for saying this is that it is unclear who the narrator is and it is not clear where she has gotten her information. The relationships in this book are touching and heartfelt, yet it veers off at times and it's difficult to tell who is being addressed and whether the narrator is present or not. She is not James Joyce or Virginia Woolf so these things are not stylistic, but are annoyances in the midst of some beautiful writing and an affecting story. The descriptions of the Hamptons in the 1940s are charming and wondrous in light of how glitzy it has become today. Read this book, but prepare yourself for a bit of confusion."
1,Painful to read -- Dont.,"This book is a waste of time. Boring, whinny and very choppy. I'd rather go the dentist for a deep tooth cleaning than read this book again."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first novel I have read by Alice McDermott, but not the first ""National Book Award"" winner. At it's conclusion, I find myself wondering how this book ever won any award. It was a disappointment. The novel's premise is promising - reflection on a man's life from the vantage point of his wake - a love lost without closure because of a burdensome lie, and the emptiness of alcoholism. The promise of the story unfulfilled because not one of it's characters is described with enough dimension to enable the reader to identify with personality or plight. The reading laborsome due to ineffective description and frequent time jumping. Even when the reader is drawn into the present, a tale more compellingly told - it is short lived - leaving the reader flat, unsure if they want more or are just glad the confusion is over. Perhaps that is the metaphor (about life) the author was after, but this reader, unfortunately, was not made wiser. No recommendation here."
3,I see both sides,"Charming Billy is for older readers who have experienced some loss in their lives. It's seeped in nostalgia and longing for days past, aimed at members of dying families and those with regrets. It's not about its characters or its plot. When the story ends, you won't be thinking ""Man, I wish I could spend more time with my friends Danny and Billy."" It's about a fading community - one the reader is acutely not a part of. I think the novel does a fairly good job of exploring its depressing themes, but I did not enjoy reading it. Great books feel like they were written especially for you - no matter who the you is. I did not feel that this book was written for me."
1,Horrible book,"This was the most aweful book I have ever read. I would NEVER, EVER, EVER recommend it to anyone. Waste of money, waste of time and a waste of an award."
1,Do not waste your time. . .,"This book is over-rated. It was awful, not worth the pain and effort it takes to wind through the confusing and dragging plot. There are tons of better books in the world...."
2,Where's the charm?,"I love good literature, but I'm having a tough time finding anything about this book to praise. Its ""plot"", if you can call it that, is circular and self-defeating. I suppose being dead doesn't automatically disqualify a main character from being interesting, but in this case I didn't really care a fig about Billy or any of his numerous, ordinary relatives. A few ruminations in a book give one time to reflect along with the author. An entire book of ruminations is tedious in the extreme. If you are looking for recreational reading, I would suggest you pass this one up."
4,A moving beautiful reading experience,It is true that the author tells her story through many voices but I did not find it as difficult to follow as the reviews below describe. Certainly Faulkner's voices are harder to make out but your reward for trying is great -- I feel the same way about this book. Yes there is some work involved [but really not very much] but it is definitely worth the work. This book brought tears to my eyes.
1,"A boring, plodding read","I just didn't ""get"" this book. I had to force myself to finish it, and I'm sorry I wasted the time. The writing was confusing and it was hard to figure out whose thoughts were whose. I was three-quarters of the way through it before I realized it was Dennis' daughter who was the narrarator. Why was she the narrarator? I'll never buy an ""award winning"" book again because my tastes have nothing in common with the committee that chose this one."
2,Who's she talking to now?,This read was very difficult to follow. The change in person and passages through time was frustrating. I often found myself having to go back a few pages just to verify where I was. This is one book I would not recommend
1,I felt like I wasted my time reading this book.,If the computer would let me give this book no stars I would have. I did not like any of the characters enough to care. I was so disappointed in this book.
1,Had to force myself to finish,"It had the potential to be a good story, but extremely slow...I was disappointed."
1,Don't bother,"I was anxious to read this book based on reviews (I usually reserve judgement) and the National Book Award. What a mistake! I had a hard time following the book with all the jumping around. I loaned it to a family member who also felt the book was greatly overrated. The prose was ok, but I've read many more books with better prose. I had a hard time understanding why the book was repetitive and jumped so much. Don't bother buying this. Borrow it from the library or a friend!"
3,Good Writing but Something Missing,"The story was interesting and the writing beautiful. I could visulize the settings and the time periods; however, I expected a spirituality that wasn't quite there."
3,Charming Billy: A Novel,"A little hard for me to follow who was telling the story & how characters were related. At the beginning of each chapter I wasn't sure whether we were in the past or the present. The main character, Billy, was a strong one, struggling with life yet endeared himself to all his friends & relations."
3,I would have loved it as a short story,"Alice McDermott is a very talented writer, and I believe she does a great job of creating her prose. However, I feel like ""Charming Billy"" is a story that could have been told in the concise format of a short story, where it would have been better served (in my humble opinion). As it exists in its novel length format, it just seems to go on and on, expounding upon one incredibly depressing subject after the next. The tragedy of Billy's wasted life and descent into alcoholism and self destruction could have been wrapped up rather quickly, but I was instead treated to what is perhaps the most depressing book I've ever read. Yes, it's well written, but it's certainly not my cup of tea- I prefer to spend my leisure time reading books of a more uplifting nature."
2,Charming?,"I'll start by saying that I bought this book because I read That Night by AM a few years back and I really liked it. She is a very good writer and she develops some good characters. But sadly this one sits on the shelf with the bookmark stuck on page 178...and that is where it will remain. I've put it down twice and read other books, but each time I picked this one back up for another try. I finally had to admit to myself that this is not a very good book. This would have made a decent essay or short story, but there is just not enough here for me for an entire book. AM seems to out of her way to knock the reader over the head with every Irish stereotype know to man. I would try another by this author because I think she is very skilled, but I give this book two stars only because of her prose."
5,It's a literary masterpiece,"This was one of the better books I've read in a long time. It is on my Top 10 favorites. Alice Mc Dermott captured the essense of family, the feel of Queens, New York, the feel of East Hampton, New York, the 1940's up to the 1990s. I wanted to copy down some of her great words of wisdom on dying, and living and lonliness... However, I would only recommend this book to someone who is relatively content - the despair of lonliness lingers throughout each page."
3,"Gritty, sumptuous prose","A portrait of second-generation Irish odyssey in America. The book begins with Billy's funeral, and struggles to understand his plight."
1,I must have missed the point,"This was a recommendation for our book club and all 6 of us were struggling with it. This beloved Billy was so underdeveloped as the central theme character and the other characters were weak and enabling to the point where you could not feel for any of them. The story jumped back and forth and the plot was very weak. What in the world made this book such an award winner? OBVIOUSLY, I MISSED SOMETHING HERE!"
2,Too many errors of omission and commission for a second ed.,Too many errors to be a useful text for a serious course in financial markets. Virtually ignores the market for mortgage backed securities. Ignores the interest on interest component of total return. Discussion of zeroes is muddled. Discussion of YTM is incomplete. Even the chapters on commercial banks and Fed policy contain the same old mistakes seen in most money and banking texts.
2,This book insults the intelligence of all but newcomers,"Although this might be a perfect book for those looking for simplicity, I would not advise it to anybody with previous exposure to finance.The book is a way too simple, and reveals huge ignorance on the markets outside the US.I think the book is very much a benchmark to reveal ignorant finance - teachers."
1,Subprime Loan Crisis,This book which I purchased new from Amazon is missing pages 297-344. If I tried to understand the hot topic in all of finance right now I'd be up a creek because the publisher didn't feel I should have the tools to learn about it. Ridiculous for a book in its fifth edition.
3,It works!,And that's about the size of it. Mounted on '07 Roadstar w/ms batwing. To be honest with you I really don't care for the looks of it on my bike. As far as I'm concerned it's too big and ugly. Looks like a chrome mantel clock sitting there in the middle of the handle bars. Very obtrusive. I would have been much happier with a smaller unit I could mount anywhere. I may return.
4,Definately worth reading,"The idea of ""be cautious"" should apply to any books on the power of the mind... but should not prevent people from learning to use that power. I found the book to be interesting, informative, easy to read (MUCH easier than Shapiro's books) and definately recommend it. I also found that the technique for pain control works... at least for me."
4,very useful,This book will be helpful to anyone who works in the field of counselling and therapy as well as anyone suffering from any stress or anxiety. It is based on well researched techniques.
1,Big Mistake!,This book describes an eye movement technique that has no published track record and nothing reviewed by experts to back it up. Some readers might be lucky. But I can tell you from personal experience that using the eye movements alone can cause major emotional distress. Don't take a chance on making things worse!
2,Not worth the money,"Save your money, go out and buy a cheap white lamp, and use your own paint. The paint was bad (half dried out) and the pom-pom fringe was nothing special. Not a bad gift for my niece, but definitely for an older child."
1,Poor quality control,I was not happy over all with this product. When my daughter went to use the paint they were all dried up. The paints were very old. We had to go out and buy our own paint so she could do this project. So how do you explain to a 8 yr old why sanata brought something that she couldn't use.
2,Fun but a disapointment,"I gave this to someone for christmas, and then we went to paint it and the paint was hard, it was like putty. It is a very nice toy but i was very disapointed that we had to go out to the craft store to buy new paint because the supplied paint had turned into putty."
1,the most helpful review,this product [...]. no one should be tricked into buying it like I was so that is why I am writing this review. I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and she hated it. She tried to do it but it was a really tiny lamp and the fringe and things to decorate it with are very cheap and ugly. I also didn't like this product because it didn't please my daughter and it was much to expensive for what it is. It is worth about 6 dollars and they are selling it for about 20-25. I really don't think that anyone should buy this product as it is realy bad.
2,Disappointing,"I read all the reviews and was excited to purchase this kit for my eight year old.However, the lamp was TINY, only big enough for a night light really. The fringe was difficult to get to stay on. And the lamp base was so fragile that when it was accidentally tipped on my daughter's desk it shattered, only a week after we purchased it."
4,Great Toy/Project,"I am very happy with this lamp. I bought it for my 7 year old cousin as a gift and she fell in love with it. The lamp came with the paints for her to design however she wanted to. It is a great way for kids to open their minds and be creative. The one thing I would suggest is that it came in a variety of colors. It seems too much like a project for little girls only. Otherwise, it's a great product."
1,BAD!!!!!!!,I hated this thing its a waste of money! The glue they give you to glue the pink pompoms dosent even stike and it is not good. I dont think any one should buy this lamp!
4,Shrimper or Runner?,"Leroy saw a gang mugging an old woman. The police came to Leroy's house. Leroy said he did not know anything. The gang threatens to cut him and they trashed his mom's house. Leroy ran away to his grandpa's house. There he learned to become a shrimper. Then the Chicago police came to have Leroy testify. In the end, Leroy's dad came to offer him a way out. Leroy's dad ran numbers for a living. He said that Leroy could come to New York and run numbers for him. Will Leroy take the way that his dad told him or will he go to Chicago to testify?This book was O. K. It should have been longer. It seems the author did not finish the book before the story was finished."
1,"Bizarre, Weird, Waste of Time and Money, Disappointing",The first was great. This second one is simply bizarre and lacking in every aspect. Probably one of the worst children;s movies ever.
5,Caution - Description and Picture do not match,"Excellent knives that match German made knives of the same style. Howerver, be careful with the this description - The knives pictures here are the LamsonSharp Silver series. The handles are NOT made of rosewood in the silver series. They are made from resin-infused Pakkawood handles. The rosewood handles are a different line simply called LamsonSharp Rosewood. There are also LamsonSharp Earth and Fire lines which have different handles. (check their website for more information). All the forged knives (Silver, Earth, Rosewood and Fire) are the same steel and same quality but also be aware that LamsonSharp makes a stamped series of knives that are of a lesser quality and price."
2,Does Studs Terkel Know About This?,"Only in this age of ""sampled music"" can something blatantly copied be called an homage or an update. Studs Terkel's book is the definitive voice of working Americans. Heidi Klum's day-to-day has very little to do with any of us. Treat yourself to the original."
3,Alibris - Changed review from awful to satisfied!,"At 1st I wrote that ""Alibris claimed this book was in very good condition. The book could not be opened without a page coming off of the spine. The pages were yellowed. I hardly call this a very good condition! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"" They contacted me almost immediately and unfortunately, they didn't have another copy to send out to me but told me to keep the damaged book and gave me a full refund. I was impressed with the way they resolved this issue and would try them again.World Aflame"
1,"Works fine, but they lie about the frame","Not a bad board. Works about as you would expect. However, the frame is not oak, but some stained softwood-looking thing. I would have given it 5 stars had they not lied about the material.By the way, I thought at first that the board was terrible, as I could not erase without a wet cloth. Turns out that Crayola chalk sucks; I upgraded to Prang and now it's happy."
5,CUTE!,"Very cute, realistic, and the striped pole adds a special touch. Another winner from Melissa and Doug!"
3,Cute but flimsy,"It's cute, and my daughter loves it. The galloping and neighing noises are fun, but note that it does not come with even tester batteries. My children enjoyed it before we put in batteries. Unfortunately the head fell off the stick on the second day without any rough play. I was surprised because I had selected this one based on all the reviews that praised it as sturdy. My husband superglued it, and it seems to be holding."
1,Poor product quality,"It took my grandson about an hour to break the stick part of the horse. After I looked at the broken pieces, I could see how cheap the wood was that it was made from. At best it was a piece of a branch, with flaws throughout. I would never buy a cheap item like this again. Shame on Melissa & Doug!!!!"
4,Riding Horse,"My 4-year-old niece loves this toy! She galloped around all day with it after opening it. I attached a princess crown to its head with some thread, and that was even better in her eyes. The horse makes a galloping sound and a whinnnie, it is very cute. My only problem is that the head is a bit wobbly and I am nervous that eventually it may fall off. But, so far so good."
3,horse on a stick,"i got this for my son for a program at school, he played with it for a while then got bored with it, but it was very nice for the price."
2,Over priced stick pony,"Was what I ordered however was overpriced for what I received, quality wasn't all that and one would of thought the batteries would have come with it for the price."
4,great kids' toy,"My daughter loves this horse. It has been very sturdy so far, and the ""horse"" sounds are great too. The velcro on the reigns isn't very strong, but everything else is holding up well."
5,Fun toy,My grandson fell in love with this horse right away. He has played with it so much. Great for a 2 year old when they can't get outside to work off some energy. He loves it inside and/or outside. So far has held up beautifully. He loves the sounds. Have always been pleased with anything by Melissa and Doug
2,Disappointed,I expected far more since this horse is a Melissa and Douglas item. The sound was okay .. not great. The horse's head became floppy on the pole within a few days. My granddaughter is only 21 months old and did not uses this toy very much.
5,Classic stick horse,"My 2 year old was a cowgirl for Halloween and wanted a horse. This one is a great classic horse, like I had when I was a kid"
1,Fun but,My 3 year old loved this but the head broke off from the body on the first night. I thought Melissa and Doug is a good brand. I am very disappointed.
3,Its good but might break soon,"My daughter loved it, and plays with it a bit, however my daughter is very active and when she starts running around and jumping the head moves way too much and there is no way to tighten it. So it seems that it will be falling off soon. Will give an update later. Don't forget that it needs two AA batteries."
3,Justice: What's the right thing to do,The video is fine. The quality of the dvd is the problem. This is the second copy we have purchased. Thedvd's are weak and break even coming out of easy release cases. This copy already has cracked just in our opening and examining the dvd's. The quality of the discs is poor.
4,"It's ok, but do you really need to buy it???","The song is really tight, but why they didn't put on the single remix {xcuse me again}, and the video? It's too poor to my liking, even if you hardcore fan of Hova"
5,Only for experts!,"The question is:What is the meaning of this book?The answer is:A very technical issue for civilians to understand!If you are looking for a Bio like Andy Mcnabb B20, or other special forces around the world books you will be very disapointed! The fact is that is a crime rating this book 1 star if you dont understand the meaning of some concepts refered on the book.This is a very well constructed and complete HANDBOOK , that is a rarity to find outside Military formation , like Seals Training Program, SAS selection! This is a book that is used to give very advanced military planing and preparation before an operation!And of course dont give any details about places , names and persons. Im very admired how this book is published in civilian press because great part of his content is classified!Thats the reason why you wont see any publisher or signature on it!Great book for military people not only to read but also to use!"
1,Patrol Leader Handbook Review,This book is basically an outline of the steps a SEAL patrol leader would use to plan a mission. The book doesn't give any interesting info.
1,Historical masquerading as a romance,"...and a bad historical at that. This novel loses credibility by posing in the romance genre and is a disappointment in the long-running career of this fine author. Romance fans want accuracy in their historicals but we also want happy endings....and having the heroine end up as the Other Woman doesn't count. Sorry, only one star, and if you read it, get used."
4,Tender Warrior,"I would have loved to give this book 5 stars because it's one of the most romantic I have ever read and you never doubt the sincerity of the protaganists' love. For that reason, I was satisfied with the ending, because there is no denying Ruy and Mirjana desperately love each other and will do their best to succeed. Besides, Ruy did wed Jimena, ward of the king, and this is historically accurate. Not that I can say that for the rest of the book. This is a book about the greatest Spanish hero of all time, El Cid, and never do we hear about or witenss any of Cid's heroic actions. He's a very nice hero, but that could have been anybody elsein history, too. What a wasted opportunity!"
5,Great carving set,"I wanted a good carving set for the first thanksgiving at my house. I didn't want something cheap-o that wouldn't last or hold an edge, but i didn't want to spend a fortune either. This kit seemed to fit the bill, had good reviews, so I took a gamble. In my opinion it paid off. It came with a decent edge on it, but after first use, I sharpened it up a bit more.Since then, I've carved chickens, turkey, and a roast beef and it has worked just fine.Well worth the purchase price."
5,Very Interesting and Historical Recording,I am primarily a fan of country/delta blues and was searching in this genre when I stumbled across this recording. We live in the Smoky Mountains area and hear this type of music often so it caught my attention. Its a great collection of this lost music. The quality is not a high level but the age of the recordings makes this understandable. Its interesting to hear some elements found in country blues in this music. So many point to African influence as the primary source of country blues but that is simply not the case. It had its part to play certainly but folk music in America was like anything in the depressed portions of our country of this era...they took what they had around them and used it. The melting pot coming together to make great American folk music. Over all a nice cd especially for its historical value.
5,Exhilirating String Band Music!,"This is one of, if no the best, old-time string band compilation I've ever heard. The fiddling is intense, frenetic....as if the fiddler's life depended on getting that riff down. All of the string bands featured on the compilation are tight, rollicking ensembles, ranging from the stellar Grayson & Whitter to the stellar Frank Blevins performances. One listen to Blevins' version of ""Sally Ann"" and you're hooked on old-time string bands for life. Includes a well-written set of liner notes describing the geographical and sociological milieu these performers came from.This is Old Hat's first compilation and it is great!"
4,Rare Old Time Music Collection Rings True,"OLD-TIME STRINGBANDS FROM ASHE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA & VICINITY, 1927-31 Wonderful Reissue of 78 RPM recordings featuring Carolina Nighthawks (Ashe), Grayson and Whitter(Va), Frank Blevins & His Tar Heel Rattlers (Horse Creek Band), Ephraim Woodie & The Henpecked Husbands, others. Most tracks have not been released on other anthologies. A must for the old time music fan, the information booklet alone is worth the price! If you could find these orginal 78's they'd cost you hundreds of dollars."
2,"Won't last long, horrible Visiontek customer service","I purchased this card months and months ago right about when it came out. It went defective and I got an RMA from visiontek for repair. After a month, no new card. I emailed them and they stated they often go out of stock, but yet they always had them available on their site.Replying to my 4th email they stated they'd get a card to me by the end of the week. 3 weeks later and I've received NO card. Doom3 was released, didn't have a card to play it with. Half Life 2 arrived, still nothing. I wasted $399 and STILL have no card. Now they just ignore my emails.Sure, if you get a card that works fine, then i'm sure they are OK."
4,Cloud Heaven,I love this window film! It makes my bedroom feel like I am flying in the clouds :) Plus I get the privacy that I was lacking. Thank you!
3,Bogen-Manfrotto Automatic Monopod,"This monopod was very good quality the company that sold it to me was very helpful but, I had to send the product back. Not the companies or the equipments fault. It had to do with my inability to keep the equipment balanced. You can never go wrong with a Bogen!"
5,One of my favorite's!,"I received this book as a Christmas gift and use it regulary. Not only are the recipes wonderful, but so are the photos. You get a lot of history about the dishes, where they originated, etc. I have made a lot of the recipes in the book and have not had one disappointment. It's Irish cooking at it's best. I would recommend this cook book to anyone who loves to cook and enjoy's a good Irish meal. Two of my favorites are the Dingle Pie (spiced lamb pie) and Beef and Stout. Hearty meals, easy, delicious. Enjoy!"
2,Does NOT work with PS2 slim,"The cord arrived quickly, but it is NOT the required cord for a PS2 slim. Needs to update the product description."
1,Incorrect Item.. Twice,"I ordered a PlayStation 2 power cord, as advertised. However, I got a computer power cord instead. I reported this to the seller and was told that I would be sent the correct one through the mail. I just received it today thanks to delays by Hurricane Sandy, only to discover it was ANOTHER computer cord. There IS a difference between a computer cord and a PlayStation 2 cord. I do not recommend this seller. Save yourself some time and some money. Order from a different seller."
4,Works but doesnt fir completely,"The power cord doesnt fit completely but still works 100 percent however,doesn't work with playstation slim so don't try it"
2,"Doesn't work for my Playstation 2 ""fat"".","As the title says, it didn't work for my current version of my Playstation 2 and like in other reviews have said; you have to force it in the Playstation 2 power port. Although, when I tested it on the AC adapter for my Ps2 slim and plugged it into the console, it worked like a charm.Overall I give it two out of five stars because it didn't do what I needed it for, but can still be used for something else. Problem being my Ps2 slim is close to being bricked and can't function properly, not due to the power cord though."
5,Need more but order wrong but delivered,"Love price and delivery was quick, everyone loves its and wants one, tell them amazon.com. Needed for cord with power pack but got what I asked for."
3,PLaystation II Cable,"The cable is functional, not an original Playstation cable, they have a square and round keyed plug design to be inserted only one way, this cable has both round and is still usable. I guess it really doesn't matter which way it is inserted as the device still functioned."
4,Power Cord,The power cord for playstation II was very easy to find in Amazon.com. I ordered it and the cord came in just a very few days. The price offered was excellent and service was great.
5,"Our ""Bible"" for the walk","My brother and I (68 and 65) used this book for a wonderful trek through England. It got rained on, snowed on, wind-blown, dropped, and generally abused but got us successfully to the end.We found we didn't even make the distances suggested for the slower walkers, but I'll take the blame for that. Too many interesting things to look at along the way. We got passed a lot by faster, more serious walkers - but we made it!The book has incredible detail for the actual walk, and also includes information on food, drink and housing.We had used Stedman's Coast-to-Coast book a couple years ago and had been very happy with it. So this time we knew exactly which book we wanted.We learned that a big thick rubber band is handy to hold the place of the current trail map. And a couple paper clips or alligator clips to mark some other pages to which we found ourselves regularly referring. We could flip it open and hold it open, without having to pull off our gloves."
1,Bought it on the street,The DVD arrived on time and was completely useless. Wouldn't play at all. I had ordered another movie from another source and it was fine so I don't think it was my machine although the source wrote back with a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG technical answer as to why it wouldn't play which involved lots of numerical jibberish about what kind of machine would play it. It was as if I had bought a Chinese knock off on the street. At the price I paid it wasn't worth repackaging and sending back so I just ate it. I am very disappointed with this vendor.
1,The Comfort of Strangers,This dvd began showing pixelation problems abut 2/3 of the way through; from that point on it was almost unwatchable.It froze completely several times and I had to restart the dvd to try to get it to function again.Another defective disc from another Amazon Seller...I'm about ready to simply quit buying any older movies from Amazon Sellers. Too many defects.
1,"Rupert Everett AND Giorgio Armani, how could it fail?","Wow, this is not a good movie. I didn't even know who Helen Mirren was when I saw this movie. I later grew to love her from the Prime Suspect movies on PBS. Anyway, Helen Mirren is wearing caftans throughout the film and Christopher Walken gives her back problems and Rupert Everett lost his skinniness and grew muscles. ""I made a huge mistake"" paying to see this film when it came out."
1,Disgusting and a total waste of time,"This movie goes on and on with this kind of ""hang on the edge"" feeling for the entire movie (with nothing really happening). You are wondering what horrible thing this creepy couple is up to when they befriend this young couple from England. It drags on and on. Then, for some stupid reason, at the end of the movie, after the young couple realizes these people are weird and up to something, they go back to meet their fate -- WHY? After I watched this movie, I was so mad. I wanted to go outside of the theater immediately with a picket sign to stop any other poor souls from watching this movie. I didn't want them to waste their time and didn't want the movie to get a single dollar more profit. Horrible -- don't see this!"
1,CRAP,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although Walken plays in it. The screenplay is very close to the book but it looks like it was produced for video with no love to the story at all. END
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"Oh my gosh - this was a hilarious one.I still remember my friend and I watching this in the theatrefirst run and laughing our heads off. Absolutely, brutally,unintentionally funny. Worth seeing for the ""so bad it's good""factor."
2,not her best,"For some reason, this is the first of the series that just failed to click with me altogether. It seemed to lack soul and depth. I couldn't engage with the secondary characters, and St. Germain seemed rather dim. Sorry, i love most of the other books, even ones i didn't like so much I at least did have to struggle to finish. Having said that, i do look forward to the next one!"
1,*Yawn*,"I have been reading these books from the very first when I picked up ""Hotel Translvania"" off the shelf in first edition. So believe me when I say:In this book nothing happens. Well, there are two love scenes at either end and a bit of excitement at the very end of the last chapter... but otherwise, he travels and worries about money, so nothing new.Big yawn.Come on, Chelsea, do something new. Bring the count into the 21st century so we can see how he copes with cameras and cell phones everywhere."
5,How to do it by one who has done it,A very useful book for both f2M and m2F TSs. Offers some insites into the complications and the joys of this process. I HIGHLY recommend getting both this and the second volume in the set.
4,"Great photos, but you'd think mountains have no geology!","Yes, stupendous, top-notch photography.. but my high expectations from the author Collier, a geologist by training, were dashed against the rocks when I discovered nearly zero geology in the text. Collier wrote A LAND IN MOTION about the San Andreas fault and you'd think he could've included more on a subject near and dear to his heart for Arizona's tectonic history. Yes, there are books out there on Arizona geology, but I'm not sure they contain photos like these. An ARIZONA HIGHWAYS beauty for the coffee table, but also a missed opportunity for Collier."
4,EXCELLENT,"As a reader who has been reading Arizona Highways for many years (back to the 60s at least) I would offer my opinion that this may be the last, best book published by them (2003) before they radically reduced both the size of the magazine and the excellence of their editorial direction. If a reader wishes to see what the magazine once USED TO BE, buy and read this wonderful book.The various chapters are listed below:IntroductionFour Peaks (Standing watch over Phoenix)White MountainsHuachuca MountainsKofa MountainsHualapai MountainsNavajo MountainChuska and Lukachukai MountainsSanta Catalina Mountains (my favorite because I know people who reside in this beautiful area of Tucson)Mount Trumbull and the Uinkaret MountainsSan Francisco PeaksNot many readers will be disappointed by this colorful, excellent volume. Just a fine book as was Arizona Highways magazine at the time this book was published.""AZ-Mtns"""
4,Keep it Near the Fire,"This is a warm little anthology that merits a spot on that little table next to the big armchair, not far from the fireplace. It's just small enough to be held by the hand that is not holding the coffee (or cognac). The selection by Robert Atwan is ecclectic; it focuses on contemporary poets, but also includes poems by Anne Bradstreet, Dickinson, Emerson, Longfellow, the Lowells (Amy and James Russell), and Frost, among others. The illustrations, woodcuts by Thomas Nason, are a delight. Readers will find a wide range of emotions here. Many of the poems are completely unsurprising and offer just what a reader would expect in an anthology of this sort. Others are wonderful surprises, especially, for example, Charles Simic's ""Winter Night"", a great little poem that captures the rich despair one might feel on a winter night in New England."
3,Two good songs,There is only one or two good songs on the album. I knew this going into the purchase. The style a Mexican dance style.
1,Cable did not last 3 months,"When I ordered this cable I thought it would at least last until I could find an affordable alternative to the tv I had at the time.No such luck, This cable is very thin and flimsy once it branches out to the separate ports, and it is a stiff cable, low quality, so you can't bend it much without it losing connection. I do not recommend it to anyone."
2,"Good component to have, lousy quality.","I highly recommend you not waste your money on cables made by this company. The plugs fit very loose and fall apart. I'm not saying shouldn't get higher quality cables like S-Video or Component they're great, in fact I would recommend if you have both the S-Video and the Red, Blue, Green holes on your TV to go straight to the Component (The Red, Blue, Green) cause it makes the scanlines less noticable making the image even clearer even if it's not a HDTV plus if you do get one you'll have the right cables to get the best quality. All I'm saying is either get the ones by Sony or Monster Cable cause the Indec cables are pretty shoddy."
4,AV Component vr S/Video,"I just bought the component AV cable from a 3rd party company and already has the S/video cables (3rd party too) . I've read that AV component it's much better than S video, and tha's why I bought it. But is not!. AV component seems to be a little better than standard AV cables (RCA). S video gives an extraordinary brilliance to images. Video Component looks opaque, maybe Monster cables works better. In summary:1- S/Video2- AV component3- Standar Av cables (rca)What's your experience?, could it be 'cause they are 3rd party?"
2,"Only able to rate ""half"" of the order","The problem is that, after repeated messaging, importcds still only fulfilled the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER portion of this ""Double Feature."" The quality of the former is excellent and worth the price were it the ONLY offering. However, I expect orders to be fulfilled as promised."
5,John,What more can I say? Love him. Great movies. Grew up to these movies. They never disappoint. Thank you kindly.
2,Item not recieved,"Never received this item, contacted seller who told me that it must have been lost in the mail. My account was credited. Would not recommend this seller."
4,I like Stayin Alive,"I have never seen Sat. Night Fever so I cannot comment on it. But for the people dissing on Stayin Alive: I like that movie. I gave a 4 star review because it's john travolta and i think he is still a star. Stayin alive is a good movie. it may not be as good as sat night fever but it is still pretty darn good. My favorite part is at the end when he says ""Do you know what I wanna do? Strut!"""
1,Arrived broken,"Fairly loosely packed in a larger box which showed no damage. When I opened them, the cups were fine, but the box of saucers rattled. The bottom saucer had cracked in half; the next one was in small pieces. Looks like it could have been a very useful product if only it had been packed better. Oh, and I get charged $7.35 for the pleasure of sending them back!"
5,LOVE this set,"I use this set every single day and I just love it. I have the DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker which by the way is the most wonderful machine. Two of these cups fit under it but I usually just use the one with a double shot into it. They are very sturdy cups and the holder is great next to my machine where like the other reviewer stated you can have the cups at your fingertips AND they looks great. The holder was a bit snug and when we put the cups in, it was hard for them to go down and stack correctly but it's pliable so we just used a little muscle and pulled the ""spokes"" apart a bit and it was just fine. This set is well worth the price. It's made very well and looks exactly like the cups and saucers we used in Paris."
2,Flawed Porcelain,"I really love the design of this set and hoped it would had been a pleasant match to my espresso machine. However, there were huge flaws in the porcelain in two of the mugs. Obviously there was no quality control or else they would have seen this. Amazaon didn't offer an exchange option either, only a refund option."
4,Love this cup/saucer set,"I love the design of this cup and saucer set. For me, the cups are a perfect size and I really like the design which is perfect for leaving on the counter next to the coffee makers.The product is made in China but the ""made in China"" decal washes off during the out of box first washing.The product was shipped promptly and I received it a couple business days after ordering on the 5-8 day selection.The issue I have is that the base of the cup/saucer storage tower is bent. Instead of hassling with a return, I just did some work on it in the vise and managed to get it so the stand is now level and not wobbeling. The plates cover the imperfection in the circular base. To me this shows a lack of commitment by the manufacturer and seller into the inspection of the product prior to shipping."
4,I love this color,"It looks nice but I think it needs a 2nd coat, of course that depends on preference. I love it and I recommend it."
3,Start your HT here,I was not blown away by this book but it does give you a good foundation. Of course with any industry that is changing as fast as home theater the book is a little out of date but still valuable.
3,Lacks Graphics,"This is a reasonably comprehensive entry level guide to the basics of choosing and installing a home theater. It's adequate for verbal learners, but very weak in photos and diagrams to supplement and illustrate the text. This is a detriment for all users of the guide, and a fatal flaw for visual learners."
5,Detailed resource for newbies or experts,"Practical Home Theater cuts through the rat's nest of cables, vocabulary and acronyms to clearly present the essentials of home theater. If you're seeking a single book -- packed with details -- that lays it out simply and coherently, look no further."
5,Happy Times!!,The kiddos and adults loved these. They were launching them all over the house on Christmas Day. With four boys using them non-stop I figured that they would not last too long but instead they are just like new! These were a great addition to our Christmas this year!
1,"great idea, poor durability","As a mother of two boys, 8 and 6, I thought this would be a great, unique gift for them. They were excited about it at first, and played with it often. Net is very stretchy and spider is prettty cool. However, by about the 4th day, the net which is like a stretchy, rubbery substance, easily ripped. Now there's a hole right in the middle of the net, and the toys is no longer played with."
2,Technical and Thorough at the Expense of Readability,"This book, while generally pretty complete, seems to have trouble explaining the concepts in anything other than formal definitions and the few ""user friendly"" explanations that is does give leave quite a bit to be desired. This book would make a great reference for anyone already familiar with the concepts of computability but does little to accommodate readers that are new to the subject. There are some pretty good step by step explanations of more basic subjects like non-deterministic finite automata but the explanations that are given for more complicated topics are very flaky. Take the pumping lemma for example. The book gives a very brief overview, a more formal definition, and then (prematurely) jumps into examples. One key concept, ""pumping length,"" is described simply as ""a certain special value."" Its meaning is vaguely hinted at on the next page but is never actually stated - formally or in plain English."
1,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,"This book is terrible as a text book. The chapters give very simplistic examples, then the problems at the end of the chapters are very difficult. There is no solutions manual, so there is no way to know if you are doing the problems correctly. Let's face it, Automata theory is math, who ever heard of a college level math book without a solutions manual."
1,The worst CS book,"As a near-straight A computer science student, I bought this book while taking an Automata and Computability class. This book was terrible. It had zero real life examples of how the theory would ever be used. I simply couldn't relate to the material. In fact, all of the examples provided were outdated by at least 45-50 years. Some of the devices used in the examples no longer existed (like some pre-historic tape machines).I later took the same class with another teacher who didn't use any books but instead used examples like soda machine that dispenses correct change, etc. Much more helpful.The book was very confusing. I'm glad it's over. I left the book in the lobby of my building for some poor soul to pick it up. :)"
4,"Good text, fair price","This was used as a supplement for a theory of computations course I took. The teacher provided us all the problems and recommended any edition of this book as a supplement. I'm not a fan of text book prices, but this one is cheap and useful for studying or solidifying some concepts.This is a great supplement, though it would be confusing on its own.The problems are great and you can find answers to a good chunk of them to see if you're doing it right."
2,misleading,"yeah, sure, Sipser manages to pack a lot of difficult stuff into a small book and makes it seem easy. think again, you'll find that's because he's not telling you the whole story! a lot of interesting materials are just skipped. For example, Greibach normal form of CFG is nowhere seen in the book, which makes Sipser's explaining of converting CFG to NPDA (lemma 2.13) very uninteresting. Compare with lecture 24 in Kozen's book, you'll see the difference. This book also lacks examples. Without seeing enough examples, you just won't grasp the concepts firmly. That's mainly the reason why the exercises and problems seem so difficult.I recommend Kozen's ""Automata and Computability"", Hopcroft and Ullman's ""automata, languages, computation"" and Papadimitriou's ""computational complexity"". but not this one."
1,NOT the Kindle book!,"Peukert's book is excellent (desrves 5 stars), but the Kindle book is not this book, even though it is linked to this one."
2,scholarly to the point of unreadability,"Unless you are doing graduate-level work on the Weimar era (which I am), stay far away from this book as an intro. It is not for the timid reader. I'm trying to get my hands on the original German edition, but whether it is the writing or the translation, Peukert's book reads as if it were authored by the illegitimate, illiterate love-child of James Joyce and Henry James. Contentwise, it has very little to do with the popular perception of ""Weimar Culture;"" for that, check out Peter Gay. This book deals primarily with social and economic conditions, and hardly ever mentions politics, and even more rarely, art. If you like charts and graphs and figures though, this is full of them. That said, this is the preeminent book on Weimar Germany. It helps to have a philosophy degree to read it, though. Anthony Heilbut's excellent Exiles in Paradise is more than worth checking out if you're interested in the mass emigration of German artists and intellectuals to the US."
1,Not a good introduction,"I'm really disappointed in this book. I should have read the other reviews before I bought it. If you aren't doing your thesis on Weimar Germany, this book is not for you. It is not a good introduction to this period. It is filled with an amazingly large number of facts, but if you are looking for a primer on Germany between the world wars and the social policies that led to its own demise, this book is a bit hard to get that from, unless you are a historian, which I am not. Now, on to find a book that IS a good intro to this period."
2,Tough read...,"In my opinion, you have to be really in to this subject to enjoy this book. It's almost like reading a text book. Very informative if you love the subject but a little dry if you are just a causal reader."
2,Less Then Awesome,"I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, as I am a big fan of the horror and suspence genre. But after seeing this movie I have to say it was a HUGE dissapointment. I was expecting alot more invovlved and the whole movie centered around the court case and nothing to do with an actual exorcism. If they cut out the whole court case thing then I think I would have enjoyed it more. Unlike everyone else I say it's not worth buying."
3,Law Defense Attorney Work Watch it.,I am an Occult Scientist. This film although admits the necessary permission from the Catholic Church for an Exorcism however it does not not show that the other members as well as the Priest must receive confession.This film shows some of the horror that someone that a posessed person and her/his family under demonic possession must goes through. However this is a great film showing the the fortitude of the Defense Attorney who stands by the priest who has perfomed the Exocism must deal with and its aftermath.Excellent for us Law students.
1,Such a terrible movie,"I'm no film critic, but this movie is so awful that I felt it necessary to write a review on how bad it is. The acting reminds me of a made-for-TV drama.Serious question...was this film financially backed by Christian Fundamentalists?"
1,ohhh geez!!! not very great movie!!,"That's crap movie.. I don't like this move and too much talk in only court than less scary.. Don't make sense about movie.. Don't buy this dvd... You'll get boring this movie and not wow scary. Nahhh!! Not worth watch and buy it.. That's your choice.. To me, I never watch again ever!! I don't really like this movie. I give thumb big down!!"
3,A Basic Pleaser,"Not a bad show of basic evil, but this marries a courtroom drama with evil sprits which makes it a little hard to digest. Not so frightening representation of good over evil."
4,A decent movie.,"this is decent for a movie. in general, the movie was not scary at all. dont get me wrong, some parts would have been scary if they were not 5 minute flashes. so bottom line, do not rent this with all your friends expecing something scary.other than that, it was actually a pretty good movie. i liked how it was set up different than most other movies (like switching from the trial to the exorcism... pretty good film making.) The trial was intriguing and it kept me ino the movie for a while. The effects are pretty cool, like the part where emily is hallucinating and all the people look disfigured. That by the way is pretty much the scariest part in the movie.One more thing, this unrated sh*t has to stop. there was no nudity, no violence, no blood, no cursing, so why call it unrated. honestly, it is an advertising thing. so, watch it because its good, not because it is scary or unrated."
4,Hair-raising and fantastically creepy!,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose was everything I'd hoped it would be. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end and I was left with the same creeped-out feeling I had for Mothman Prophecies (which to this day, no matter how many times I watch that one, it freaks me out). In my book, that's excellent, although I would not recommend watching this alone at night. Or at least not alone period. The movie was very well done and captivating. My best friend and I absolutely enjoyed this Exorcism. It ropes you in from the beginning with a riveting tale based on a true story. It's something I will no doubt watch again and again, though only in the company of friends who don't mind helping me check my closets before they go home. If you like this genre, you will definitely enjoy watching this."
5,Don't be bashful -- this is not about shock factor,Excellent film. Why is it that the best movies about spirituality are made by seculars?
3,Good Exorcism. But its no Exorcist.,"TEOER is an interesting twist on the typical possessive horror movie. This particular movie is a cross between a courtroom drama and a horror. But don't be fooled by the odd crossovers, as the courtroom drama aspect and horror elements actually work well together. With the exorcisms seen through flashbacks while the main action is situated in the courtroom. However, this way of film making does not destroy the horror of the movie. The two work together well to produce a well written horror/drama with solid acting from lawyer Laura Linney and the possessed Emily Rose.This is a good, itelligent movie that is worth a try. Although the The Exorcist is still the king of Exorcism."
4,Very Good.....but it's no Exorcist,"I was eagerly waiting for this movie to come out, I have heard the case of the German Girl Annliese Michel, first from Ed and Lorraine Warren and then from Ralph Sarchie. This was a very good movie. I personnaly don't consider this movie better than the Exorcist, as of yet there has been NO movie at all to outdue themselves, until this day I have to watch the Exorcist in the day time. I didn't find it scary as the reviews, or from people saying how they couldn't sleep after watching the movie. It was good but not scary."
2,"Great concept, pity the rest is a mess","The basic concept and structure of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is sound -- a murder trial for an exorcist, intercut with flashbacks letting the audience see the events first-hand -- but they're buried under a mess of a movie.Strangely, this slapdash movie feels like the sort of original movie aired on Lifetime. If, you know, Lifetime aired stories about demonic possession.In this case, the terrible dialogue, written by someone I can only assume has never actually spoken to an actual person before, almost totally distracts from the wooden acting. What sort of drugs were given to a cast that includes some fairly dependable actors to turn them into listless zombies, I can't guess.Absolutely skippable, especially if, like me, you think the premise and structure sound really intriguing. The reality of the final film just proves all the more frustrating, in that case."
5,very suspenseful film!!,"it still scares me even though i've seen it before!!! we got the dvd the day it was first available and i still love it!! if you like suspense and horror, then get this!!"
4,Waaay Creepy!,"This is a great movie that will give you the creeps and keep you on the edge of your seat. I usually like those movies that aren't all hyped up and this was one of them.This freaked me out more than the original Exorcist and I never thought another movie would. It doesn't steal any ideas from the Exorcist and has a pretty good ending, I thought. If you like horror movies that are more true to life and not the typical slasher movie, this is for you."
4,Gripping Courtroom Drama & Thriller,"If you like thrillers, get this DVD. The movie has a number of scenes that will make you gasp. It's an unsettling psychological thriller. If you like tense courtroom dramas, get this DVD. The court scenes rival those of such classics as A Few Good Men, The Verdict, and To Kill a Mockingbird. If you like movies with an excellent cast giving memorable performances, get this DVD. Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott & Jennifer Carpenter give strong performances. This is NOT your typical gory, bloody horror movie. It provides its share of thrills, but it has a strong story line. VERY good flick."
3,3 1/2 STARS / Suspend disbelief & this movie can be creepy as hell !,"If your a gullible person!?! then this dramatic thriller might change the out-look of your tiny god fearing existence! If your like me and gods,devils & demons are no more real to you than 'Freddy Krueger''Chucky' & the Easter bunny then you should enjoy ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" for the fright factor wich is a pretty damn good factor in this film & just try to look past the shallow religious message. The EXORCIST is a masterful landmark horror movie! This film is just a very good dramatic thriller! The evil that the human mind creates is as evil as evil gets!""FACT"" This young girls belief system is what killed her."
3,Thought provoking,"Based on a true story of a girl that dies while a priest is performing an exorcism. Was it abuse? Was it a natural death? The always reliable Laura Linney stars as the high-powered lawyer who is defending the priest, nicely played by Tom Wilkinson. The movie's namesake is harrowingly played by Jennifer Carpenter, whom I only new from her role on Dexter (as his sister). She turns in a very strong performance here, showing a different side than her turn as Deb Morgan. The movie overall is pretty good, but I'm always a little cynical, and a big part of me wonders how closely this follows the facts of the true story. But regardless of the truth, the film does raise some interesting questions about the place where religion and law intersect, such as where does belief end, and psychosis begin? Hmmm..."
4,Pretty good show,"It's a pretty good movie. Not as good to me as some of my friends thought it was, but I like it. It's definitely worth watching, but it won't go down as one of my all time favorites."
4,Very good movie with powerful meaning behind it,I enjoy this movie very much. The movie was very good and the preformances top notch. What I enjoy watching the movie over and over again when I am in the mood because there is a spiritual message behind it or meaning behind it. As a Catholic I have what I believe in and I believe the movie did a good job showing what Emily Rose went through and the impact it can have on a person's life. Also I like the ending where they show what happened after the trial and that people go to see the grave of Emily Rose as a holy shine. Just my personal feelings I believe the Devil tempts the strongest of believers to test us and our convictions. But as for the movie if you want something to watch as both a powerful drama mix with horror scenes then see this movie and see how it impacts you after seeing it. I am sure you will enjoy the movie as much as I have over the past few years.
3,Interesting Struggle Between Religion and Science!,"What struck me about this film was the interesting debate between theological speculation and scientific reasoning. Was Emily Rose's death caused by a evil spirit or was it murder? Laura Linney and Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson give strong performances in this very intriguing motion picture. Director Scott Derrickson does a great job of trying to keep our interest by giving both side of the arguement without trying to insult our inteligence with a ridiculous and predictable storyline. A more inexperienced director would have tried to shock us with blood and gore, turning it into a forgetable ""B"" movie. By not taking the low road, this film actually becomes rather entertaining and spiritual. Don't let the title fool you. Give this movie a chance. You might like it, as I did!"
4,"Father Moore: ""Demons exist whether you believe in them or not.""","In THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, a priest called upon to cast demons out of young Emily is charged with negligent homicide when the girl dies after his exorcism fails. Emily suffers terribly before her tragic demise by starving herself and being removed psychotropic drugs, which in turn causes more deterioration. Loosely based on the true story of Anneliese Michel, a young Gerrman who also appeared to be possessed and who was unsuccessfully treated by the exorcism rites of two priests.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.8) The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) - Laura Linney/Tom Wilkinson/Campbell Scott/Jennifer Carpenter/Colm Feore/Mary Beth Hurt"
3,Terribly disturbing,"Don't get me wrong: the acting, the script, everything was done really well. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it was simply disturbing. This movie BOTHERED me. I don't get scared of movies easily, but this movie truly scared me. That night I woke up at 3 a.m. and that really scared me. I had to watch an hour of Conen to get me back to sleep. I don't think I ever want to watch this movie again. During Christmas, my cousins, sister, and best friend rented this movie...I had to go to bed early because I wouldn't watch it."
2,LAME AND BORING EVEN IN THIS UNCUT VERSION!,"I just got the DVD and I watched it...thought maybe something close to "" the exorcist"" .BUT is about court room drama..Some few flash back to what's happened ,nothing special about it! This is ""NOT"" horror movie AT ALL!!! Such as most people think that or I did so too. Is like drama courtroom. Have some suspense to it, that's all...acting was pretty good..But movie wasn't that much movie u want to see and excepted to be one.. SKIP this movie and don't waste your money and time like I did for nothing! Just boring court drama crap!! B"
1,Bad News,"I bought this because I am a great fan of Laura Linney. Poor Laura, what she got herself into. Poor picture BUT not only that ...this copy stopped playing and fast forwarded continually. I honestly did not get too excited because the picture was so bad...literally. Dont think about buying it. Joan Piorkowski"
3,Strange Occuance,"So we bought the movie the night it was released, got half way through it, and the strangest thing ever happened. A friend was over and she brought her healthy 10 month old cat. The cat had all shots, and was completly healthy in all ways. Next thing that happened, the cat took off running to one side of the room, let out a long blood curdleing scream, and seemed to have what appeared to be either a seizure or a heart attack and within about 15 seconds was dead. I don't really think that the two are related, but there was no cause for the cats death and to be so sudden like that, it makes you wonder. So, the movie is not bad and is reminiscent of the original Exorcist but I am leary about watching it again. You never know!"
3,Emily Rose not what I expected,The Exorcism of Emily Rose was not what I expected it to be. It's still a good movie but it lacks something.
4,Don't watch this at 3.00 a.m.,"This is an unusual mix of courtroom drama and old-school horror. As the former it's reasonably, though not notably, successful, but where this film does score is in its depiction of the torment and fear suffered by the eponymous teenage girl who believes herself possessed by demons. This is a movie that provides shudders through the things glimpsed in the dark rather than those that leap out at you dripping gore. Creeping dread is created with little more than suggestion, and, although the exorcism itself is dealt with more explicitly, this is where the film is at its most effective.However much of this is faithful to the real story (which involved a poor Bavarian girl), and whether you side with the scientific or the spiritual explanation of these tragic events, this still a gripping story that is let down only by poor pacing and structure. It deserves four stars, however, for the way it handles the fear of the unknown."
4,"""Knowing what is Out There""","This is movie makes you think how satan really exist and how he can over come your mind and body. Scary,Scary,Scary."
3,True Story - Hard to Believe,this book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I enjoyed the book but would not pass it on to friends.
2,eh,"not really what i was expecting for an exorcism movie. still a good movie out of that context, but i wasnt to happy watchin it expecting something gruesome."
5,Excellent referance,By far the most complete work on the subject I was able to locate. The chronological orginization is both useful and intuitive and the writing style makes this book fairly easy reading considering the depth of information it provides.
2,washed up singer now a dj in the bay area,not bad for a drunken singer that was so trashed in sacramento ca that he could not sing now hes a dj at kfrx in san jose hes ok at that
5,Excellent guide to the wines of the Languedoc,"It is rare to find a book devoted to the Languedoc Rousillon region, and rarer to find one devoted to that region's wines. Paul Strang does a great job of explaining the recent changes in the Languedoc wine industry and focuses on the pioneers of excellence in a region known more for its bulk table wine. His commentary is interesting and enlightening. His reviews and simple rating and pricing guides for the top wines of selected producers are easy to understand. His recommendations are rarely disappointing. On a recent tour of the region this book was invaluable. Discovering new producers, different grape varieties and interesting, often excellent wines, made the visit more enjoyable. In a region that produces thousands of different labels of varying quality, this book will help you to avoid disappointment in buying and enjoying Languedoc wines."
4,Representative for the region; great service,"Great book, well written; maybe a little dated although...Good service on delivery"
1,Never received product!!,"Haven't received book ordered like 2 months ago. Still waiting!! Have emailed seller and no response!! Do not recommend buying from this person! Product is proabably good, but obviously I just don't know!"
3,Responses to Pink's book,"The book is superb content - Pink is great and I purchased the books to hand out at a Bible study I'm teaching on the Attributes. Two of the people in the class - who have backgrounds as librarians, etc. had a problem with the ""unofficial"" appearance of the book - seeming lack of isbn #'s, etc. I did not particularly like the appearance of the book either - but - in all honesty it is the CONTENT of the book that is the reason it was purchased and if the way its printed helps control the cost to permit more folks to be exposed to Pink's teaching - GREAT!!!!!"
1,The Attributes of God,"Good reading for the basic foundations of Christianity. Beginner or old timer, there is much here for different levels of understanding."
4,learning more about God,This book is well written in that Mr.Pink does explain and elaborate on Gods attributes and relates them to the christian walk or relationship with God.
5,"Wow, very God glorifying",This is a book one will want to read over and over. It contains 17 chapters and each one deals with a different attribute of God. The chapters are somewhat short so it could even be used as a devotional. It is one of my most favorite books. I definately recommend it to anyone who has a desire for the greatness of God.
2,"Good book, poor editing, copied from the Web!","Arthur Pink is certainly worth reading. I purchased several copies to use as gifts. However, once I started reading it, I noticed lots of what seemed to be typos. They are actually scanning errors, caused when the original was scanned into a computer file for use on a Web site. This book is nothing but a printout of a web site. You can find it at several URLs. In fact, there is even a parenthetical statement in one of the chapters where Pink originally referred back to an earlier chapter, but this version refers back to the earlier ""Web site""!If this had been re-edited for publication, it would be worth it. You can find Web editions for free without the scanning errors, so you would do just as well to print those out yourself..."
5,Espanol,"Just wanted to say, ""vamos a jugar en el sol...todos los dias son dias de fiesta..."" The translation, ""let's go play in the sun...every day is a day for celebration..."" This song gets you to such a natural high; a lyrical antidepressant. What words of wisdom to live by."
3,"Useful, but not a complete solution","Kodak staticide wipes are ok for cleaning a scanner. However, I've found that they can leave streaks so it's best to use them in tandem with a genuine chamois (sp.?) towel. Clean your scanner glass with the staticide wipe, then give it about 3 minutes to dry. Then go over it with the soft side of the chamois. Make sure to be thorough."
1,How can they call this non-stick? It's super glue!,"I have been a loyal customer of Meyer and Anolon products for years but this particular Anolon open French skillet was a huge disappointment! Though it appears to be well made, food sticks to this skillet like super-glue. Despite using butter or olive oil or despite using low heat, my particular skillet has only lead to frustration when attempting to remove food from the surface after cooking. I was so certain I received a defective skillet that I mailed it to Anolon for inspection/replacement. My skillet was returned to me with Anolon stating that upon careful inspection there was ""no defect"" in the skillet. It has become apparent to me that my ""stick"" skillet is the norm for this product. Pass on this one, you'll be in for a big disappointment. You'll spend more time cleaning it than cooking with it!"
5,The best book my daughter had at one year old,"My little girl got this book from my mother at her first birthday. She is now a little more than two and she still loves it. The spine of the book is almost totally worn out. My eight month old baby likes to look at it too. We really love this book. I think it is our favorite. Allison loves to blow the feathers of the feathery bug, and the bristly bug gives her the creeps!!!"
4,Excellent book to catch their eye and hand!,"My one year old loves Feely Bugs. The array of textures and bright colors has her searching out this book every night from her shelf. My only caution is that some of the pages are not sealed well, and small pieces have fallen out. A book to be shared with a parent. Wonderful."
5,A big time favorite,My 12 month old twins just love this book. They can't get enough of touching the different critters in this book and will fight each other over who gets to touch their favorite bug... the crinkly bug.
2,The cover ripped while trying to fit on the steering wheel.,For what ever reason this one ripped while putting it on the steering wheel. I did as it said leave it in the sun to make it easier. Kept it because it would have cost me more to send it back than what I paid for it.
3,Thank Twice Befor Buying,"I can't understand it, but this particular controller was a little hard maintaining the turbo setting it kept changing...why? no idea"
3,Fine for basic functionality but not great for all applications.,Length:: 5:35 MinsMy video review Day 1
1,Hard too pair very low quality,I got these on woot for about 25 dollars total crap sounds terrible and is very hard too pair dont waste your money not worth 25 on woot let alone 75 here
4,The single most reliabe bluetooth headphones I've owned,"I've owned 3 different sets of bluetooth headphones. These are the only ones I still have. I've owned them for 9 months and I run 5 miles every morning with them connected currently to my Palm Pre. No issues. Seamless switching from music player to phone calls when someone calls me. The volume isn't phenomenal but they're very sufficient.This is pretty new technology folks, and my experience with these have been very good. I only paid $25 for mine shipped and all, and frankly I wouldn't pay more than that but I am very frugal. If you're looking for a reliable, durable, sweat resistant pair of bluetooth headphones, these will do just fine."
2,Sound quality is lacking,"I bought these headphones for use with my macbook. I wanted something wireless and mobile to use in the office. The nice thing about these headphones is that they can connect directly to the bloothtooth on your macbook (a previous bluetooth headset I bought only connected to its transmitter), and the play/pause, next/prev buttons work with itunes without any additional software.Unfortunately, the sound quality is fuzzy at best, and clearly meant for something less audibly demanding, like voice chat. My laptop speakers sound better than these!"
5,Excellent!,I think Libra is one of Julio Iglesias' best albums and this cd is excellent. Buy it and enjoy!
2,No Bass,"This speaker not very good, I am so disapointed. Because Sound not strong and absolutely NO Bass. I don't recommend."
