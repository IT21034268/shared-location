5,Rome Season 1,Gripping plot lines with excellent acting. Gives a reasonably accurate description of day to day Roman life while depicting the intrigues leading to the death of the Republic and birth of the Empire.
5,"""ROME"" Season One","I'm not a collector of DVD's unless it's really special. My whole family was hooked from Episode 1, we've watched every episode through Season Two and can't wait to purchase that season when it's available. The series is historically accurate, very entertaining, and hard to stop once you start. I'd suggest an all-day marathon on a rainy day."
5,Great series,I just love this series. It has a wonderful story. There is so much deceit in this series. I cannot wait to see season 2.
2,Not very inspiring,"I wasn't expecting something as vulgar as this series. Too many sex scenes, which only detract from what could have been a great series. I am sure somewhere in the old school of directing there is advice given to directors about sometimes ""less is more"". HBO seems to be in the business of shocking people now adays. It's a shame, for the same company who bought out Band of Brothers, you can see that there is talent there, but it seems misdirected in the Rome series."
5,"Greatest show of all time, period","The only thing disappointing about ROME is that there will most likely not be a third season. Other than that, this show is beautifully made, excellently realistic, has great music for soundtrack lovers, and plenty of violence and sex if those suit your fancy. Buy this series, it's worth every penny."
4,Entertainment Maximus,"The series was extremely well done and provided a well-scripted dramatization of Caesar's struggle for Rome. Cast was outstanding and the costumes, scenes, and overall production quality was very high. There has to be praise for HBO's taking an historical topic and translating it into a 12-hour series. The only reason I didn't give five stars for this was because a couple of the episodes lacked the ""punch"" that I expected from each, particularly following the first two episodes."
3,Tried of all the nudity/sex and little else,"Started out pretty interesting, but some of the later episodes in Season 1 are getting tedious...feels like they are trying desperately to draw viewers in by alot of nudity, sex, and more nudity and sex...I don't think I would recommend this series."
3,Sorry I bought it!,Missed Rome on TV. Really was looking forward to receiving it for Christmas. I was very disappointed! Very poor store line.Boring!
4,"Great, but not recommended for children","While I loved watching this series, I do wish there were a child-friendly version of this series that I could watch with the kids to introduce them to ancient Roman civilization. I do think that HBO could offer such a version without the sex scenes without losing too much of the flavor of the uncut version. Just a suggestion ;-)"
4,Good Deal,Slight wear and tear on outside but was aware it was used and inside was great. Good deal for the money
5,Rome-The Complete First Season,Awesome series.Fact mixed with fiction for drama and the photography is unbelievable. Adult orienated not suggested for children. Waiting for the second season to come out on DVD.
4,Those crazy Romans,"I had not seen this series at all, until I recently purchased the first season. I'm sure that a great deal of poetic liscense was applied, but the series did a great job of giving you a feel for how many people of the era may have lived, Pleb or Patrician. As much intrigue as any soap opera, scenes of the city, battlefields, the Senate and Forum. Just enough raciness to titilate without being profane. The progression of events could easily have been stretched over several seasons and still had ample historical detail - Hail Ceaser!"
2,Ads at the beginning ruin a great dvd collection,"I love the show. But it is ridiculous that HBO requires that I watch an ad for all their other shows and listen to a Tracy Chapman song before watching ROME. I paid for the DVD I want to see ROME, not an ad for Soparanos, or any other show. I wonder who the jerk is at HBO who decided to put that at the begining of the disk. Then there is the fact that HBO Dvds don't have a play all feature. Almost every other show has that tech, if you can call it tech. As a result you have to scroll through menus after each show instead of just being able to let it run. TWO stars, but would have been Five for content alone. Make better DVDs HBO."
2,uninteresting characters locked in this historical piecce,"Sorry- Episode 1 wasn't worth the rental fee at all.The characters were vicious and unendearingly one dimensional- so who would care to watch them connive and knife each other? Nero himself would care more for these folks.Great costumes, scenes- everything else was top notch.. but the viewing audience is left with little more than the spectacle and remembrance of famous historical names from ancient Rome."
5,Very Pleased,"I received the DVD set as ordered and much quicker than anticipated. The discs were in perfect working condition as stated with just the package cover for the set missing, which was no big deal. Thanks for the quick delivery, I would definitely do business with this dealer in the future."
1,"Silly, inaccurate, pseudo-historical soap","I'm puzzled at the accolades this series has received. For all the sex and gore, it's astonishingly dull and historically inaccurate to boot. A Roman centurion, with eight years experience in Gaul, who blanches at breaking a non-citizen's arm? Centurions were the thugs who kept the thugs in line. Caesar humiliated by graffiti that said he had inappropriate liaisons with Roman matrons? The matron might have committed suicide, but it wouldn't have harmed Caesar's reputation. Cicero stupid? Sure, he's long-winded and a pain to translate... but not stupid. The whole thing seems tainted by the writers' notions, perhaps borrowed from George Bernard Shaw, of Caesar as Nietzchean Superman. Watch ""I, Claudius"" instead--or better yet, read it."
4,The Power of Rome,"To anyone who likes movies such as Gladiator but would like to see the politics behind the scene will like Rome. It is a new interpretation of history while maintaining the brutality, lust, elegance and power of this great civilization. The costumes, sets and actors and movie-like cinematography capture the color and atmosphere of this great city. I highly recommend this series. HBO does it again."
5,when in rome...,"wow -- the first season lived up to all the good things I heard about it.this series captures the sex, political intrigues and pungence of life in ancient rome with a relative faithfulness to historical detail. the acting is wonderful, the plot moves quickly and the music & cinematography are dazzling.bravo -- i want more!"
4,Buddy,I saw buddy live at the Fillmore in SF back in the 70's. Fantastic drummer. Lots of fun to watch. Good DVD. We miss him as well ad Gene Krupa
4,Buddy At His Best,"This vintage performance by Buddy Rich and his band in Rochester puts the master's skills on display. At 55, he showed no signs of slowing down and his band, featuring the equal brilliance of the legendary Pat LaBarbara on tenor sax, sounds crisp and solid while performing in rather tight surroundings, typical of a club setting. The video quality, however, isn't the best and the sound could be better, but remember this was taped in 1972 before the advent of high-tech recording equipment. The narration at the beginning didn't really add a lot to the DVD, but I did enjoy Buddy fooling around on the piano and the trumpet early in the tape. The added features and interview with Buddy being Buddy were also fun to see. All in all, this is a must for any Buddy fans to own. Yes, it has its shortcomings, but it does show Buddy at his peak."
1,This DVD has lousy audio!,I think this is one of Buddy's finest concerts but the audioquality on the DVD is crap.I hope the VHS version is better.
3,OK but.....,"If you are a Buddy Rich fan you may be disappointed in that the camera angles do not show Buddy enough, mostly his great band. Buddy shows how he is the fastest drummer EVER but he does not come close to Gene Krupa, Philly Joe Jones or many other drummers as far as making the drums 'sing'. He's all technical... not musical. If you like Buddy Rich listen to Ringo Star play any Beatles song. He plays exactly what the song calls for, nothing more. Rich would destory the music. Rich could drum circles around Ringo on the set BUT Ringo plays music like Gene Krupa who was a genius in making the drums 'sing'. The video shows how fast Buddy is, really nobody comes close today."
4,Oswald in the window waiting,"This Documentary takes a position and it is tha LHO was the lone shooter and that his two shots hit President Kennedy- with one of the bullets passing through Kennedy's upper back/exiting through his neck and continuing on to hit Governor Connellyin his back and exiting out his chest to later hit his wrist and upper thigh.A re-creation of the Assassination is carried out and a Laser is projected onto Kennedy and Connelly showing that such a shotand subsequent wounds is/was highly plausible.The other bullet passing through the back of Kennedy's skull and exiting on the right side of his head.If those were the 2nd and 3rd ( and final shot ) what became of the first shot ?Was it deflected by a tree limb, a traffic light or what ?This Documentary attempts to answer that question.Two bonuses - film of Oswald in the widow waiting for Kennedy's motorcade to pass and an interview with a man who said he saw Oswald and the rifle during the assassination."
4,High quality HD video,"Although the content of this video is less than the JFK Community would expect, the video is of extraordinary HD quality.It must be watched on an HD monitor, preferably 1080p, to appreciate the newly found resolution from old films that we have seen many times in the JFK Research Community. Too bad that the National Geographic Channel as well as the History Channel are now predisposed to keeping politically correct material in place, rather than revealing the raw facts, and letting us decide on the conclusions."
5,Impressive JFK Assassination Documentary,"I really loved the HD computer application on the JFK assassination films which showed extreme crystal-clear clarity, dispelling many questionable rumors."
1,What about the 4th Bullet?!,"No mention of the 4th bullet that Dr. Humes noted during his autopsy -- the one that entered JFK's back, but did not exit (it's in the WC Report). More than 3 bullets confirm a 2nd shooter and a conspiracy. Case closed!"
5,another point of view,A possible solution to this murder. I suggest that you have an open mind as you view this informative dvd
2,Not as described,Previous reviews inspired me for the purchase. This book is NOT MBA material. I would rate it at Business 101 book. Most spreadsheet models are basically the same using the SOLVER function in excel. There are better tutorials online.
1,Do not use!,It is full of errors. The explanations are difficult to follow. There are few highlights in the text which makes scanning for a quick review impossible. There is no chapter summary. The book presumes a thourough knowledge of Excel which many students do not have. Stay away!
4,tru fit,"This product for the money is great ,fit is good too better than most,This trim looks is nice on the eyes ,not to much just enough"
4,Grab it A.s.a.p,"Springing back after the loss of Katie underwood, Bardot's first single without her is a dancey number about....Mum's. Although the lyrics leave something to be desired this track is a classic pop number with an awesome bridge that demonstrates sophie's talents like never before a.s.a.p is sure to be the song that bardot will be remembered for!"
5,Cool!,"Jessi has a teacher named Mr. Trout. He is shy so the kids play pranks on him and mean jokes. So when Mr. Trout leaves town and a subtitute goes to them, Jessi plays a prank on the subtitute."
3,Geez...,"Sometimes I think the babysitters club is too nice. I mean come on, that was not a HORRIBLE prank. It was simply including him, since he was a teacher, perhaps not the best, but still one at SMS. It wasn't even a prank! I must say though that the BSC follies was so funny. ""Won't you smell my sesame feet?"" not that bad a book, the sensitivity just annoyed me at times."
3,Snob Appeal; Preaches to the Keillor Cult,"If you're the type who loves Garrison Keillor's humor; and if you buy into the meme that Democrats are naturally imbued with Goodness and Virtue, and Republicans are Selfish and Congenitally Evil, then you will absolutely adore this book.On the other hand, if you don't hold this viewpoint, you will find Keillor's views driven by a shocking bigotry. His cloying homespuns are laid down with a mortar of vitriol for a group he calls Republicans; but who do not even remotely resemble anyone I know who wears that label. This was not a pleasant read for me. I found it hard to believe that this vile little book could be produced by a writer having a charitable heart, or the virtues he fatuously claims to be endowed with.I guess the most damning thing one could say is that Garrison Keillor is the kind of man who would write a book like this. How could anyone not pity him?"
2,"Like a Michael Moore Attack Book, But With Good Prose","Wow! What a lake-sized disappointment. Keillor is the finest humorist/writer in this country, but this book is neither funny nor particularly well-written (by Keillor standards). Yes, I am a conservative Republican, but I'm also a long time fan of GK and I approached this book with the expectation that this would be a humorously written apologia of traditional Democratic values (something my parents USED to subscribe to). Keillor always struck me as the leader of a rare breed: the self-deprecating liberal. He jumps completely out of that tradition in this book so ridiculously that I can only believe that he is trying to cash in on the Moore hysteria. What a pity. I'm left, as a conservative, with the not-so-vague feeling that my kind is not welcomed on Lake Wobegon."
1,Charming fantasy,"Garrison Keillor returns to his roots as a writer of warm fantasy tales about mythical places. In this story, all Liberals in Minnesota are altruistic, kindly, and noble, unlike the curmudgeonly Conservatives who are irritable, Dickensian, and have a pernicious hatred for small children. Why, those Conservatives are the polluters, the corrupters, the vice-peddling, war-mongering, freedom-stealing, bedroom watching, treasury-raiding hatemeisters! Boy, it's not hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys here, is it? Sadly, Keillor has abandoned all objectivity in favor of a simplistic rant that is as unfair as it is inaccurate. The one good thing about this book is that it's not rife with the vulgarity and sexual hijinks that littered his last book. What we are left with here is a talented American writer reduced to cornfed Michael Mooreisms. Tsk. Tsk."
5,Homegrown Democrat,A fine book. Garrison makes some very interesting points and has many good observations about the political climate and the destruction of the republican party which started in the GW Bush years and has now grown with the tea-bagger activists.
1,"A rant, nothing more","I'm a big fan of Keillor, consider myself moderately liberal, and have been very disappointed with the current political climate in this country. It was with high expectations I picked up the audio version of this book.While very eloquently spoken, he has nothing to *say*, at least in the first disc (1/5). I didn't make it past that. It was very much like listening to a liberal Rush Limbaugh. Lots of words, comments and complaints but nothing to back it up and give it substance. I was very disappointed, to say the least.If you want something well thought-out and researched, better to pick up Al Franken's ""Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them""."
4,A terrific conversation,"This book will, no doubt, enrage Republicans. But, as Keillor says toward the end of this book, the hottest circle of hell is reserved for those who remain neutral during a time of crisis. And so, he has put down his thoughts, for what they're worth, in this slim volume. And for a life-long Democrat like myself, this makes for a wonderful read. It is structured much like an extended conversation at Keillor's favorite St. Paul coffee shop. Autobiographical for much of the first half, the second half is the portion that lays out the case against the current administration and, in turn, will prove to be the most controversial. So many of us shake our heads at the daily absurdities and surreal proclamations that emanate from those within the Bush circles. The cathartic powers of Keillor's book prove to be a healing respite to today's headlines."
4,Refreshing and inspiring,"Garrison Keillor's gift of gab is well displayed in this fine book. For all its righteous anger at the mean spirited pettiness and mendacity of the Republic Party, Keillor remains steadfastly optimistic and patriotic about the best that America can be -- as Keillor believes still exists in his beloved Minnesota. One can only wish to be as insightful and dead-on as Garrison Keillor in exposing the fallacies of the right wing pundits and politicians.Homegrown Democrat is a wonderful book, with autobiographical points of reference. to act as an antidote to the GOP convention taking place in New York.It is also a quick read. I finished it during a short flight from Chicago to Seattle."
3,No surprises here,"Keillor is an intelligent, thoughtful Democrat (no surprise there), but you won't come away from this book with any new insights into American politics (again, no surprise), or the American psyche. Nor will you likely find yourself laughing much, something that his radio show at least elicits from time to time. Keillor, instead, thinks we want to hear what he has to say about democracy and Democrats because, well, he's Garrison Keillor. Not a very compelling reason for some of us; for others, that's all that matters.For political laughs the sleeper book is You Know You're a Republican/Democrat If..., by Frank Benjamin, which ably pokes fun at both parties.For real insight into politics, read What's the Matter With Kansas?"
5,Excellent cookware!,I received my set of Farberware cookware as a wedding gift 31 years ago and it's still in great shape. I use it all the time! I purchased this set as a gift for my daughter-in-law and she loves it! I highly recommend this cookware!
5,Excellent cookware 25 years ago and still today,"I've owned Farberware for many years. It has always been an excellent product. Sturdy, cooks evenly, very good value."
5,Great Cookware,I have used the same Farberware pots for 40 yrs. and they still look great. Even after I burnt many foods in them they still cleaned up well. I have replaced the handles once to keep them looking new. My daughter loves this set I bought her as much as I do.
2,Not even the basics,"You get what you pay for. I was unimpressed with the sizes of the pans. They are either way to small or way to large. you either have a pan to cook for one or a pan to cook for 10. You have to go out and get other pans to suppliment the missing sizes. Neither non-stck pan is big enought to cook more than one grilled cheese, and bacon has to be cut in half to fit in the frying pan. I bought two sets (one as a gift) and wish I had known how difficult it was to cook in these pans before i got rid of my old pans."
2,"andy andricci,retired cook","The pots looked beautiful when i first opened the box,the smallest pot had two black spots in the bottom of the pot,after boiling two hot dogs the pot was discolored.I placed the pot in the dish washer and at the end of the washing and drying cycle,I removed the pot and the inside was tarnished.I tried to remove the brown stain with no luck.I have not used the other pots,I am hoping that this does not repeat this problem when using them."
1,Pure-Junk-not worth the money.,I have bought 2 of them and neither one worked.1st one remote did not work.Second one played one DVD then stopped playing.Product is no good.
3,Serves its purpose,"This player produces a mediocre quality image at best, nowhere near the level in terms of color accuracy and overall video quality that my other player (Toshiba SD-1600) is capable of. My main reason for this purchase was to be able to play the few PAL discs that I now own. It is capable of doing this fairly well, so I guess it was still a good way to go, considering other players out there that perform this same function are considerably more expensive...I will continue to use the Tosh for everything but the occasional European and import discs that require the CyberHome's conversion capabilities and would recommend it to others for this same specific purpose. I would not recommend it as an ""everyday"" player however. For a bit more money there are better choices out there."
4,Gread DVD player !,"Gread player.Had August release and updated the Firmware as described in the CYBERHOME Website.The player reads VCD, SVCD and DVD just fine.(Using also CD-R and CD-RW disks)Also MP3 are a pleasure, together with the JPG slideshow module, add the Integrated 5.1 DTS decoder, PAL/NTSC conversion... GREAT Deal. ...However, I did not get it to play MiniDVD's. Maybe a future firmware upgrade will solve this ?Clearly recommend itRomain"
1,Falls Far Short,"The price was right, it looked good coming out of the box. The problem was it wouldn't play DVDs very well, if at all. I tried five different DVDs in the player and only one would play. The others got a couple of minutes into the program and the player stopped - just freeze frame. No matter what the cost, I wouldn't use this if it was given to me free."
1,Piece of Junkie,"With the good reviews at Amazon.com bought this piece of cr*p. It worked well for a few hours, after that, it just froze. Initially thought that it was my DVD, so bought a brand new DVD. It would read the menu and again it would freeze. This piece of junkie is already packed to be returned. So, Good Luck in believing the good reviews in here."
5,Great Buy,"I brought this unit after reading the other great reviews on this product. I am so impressed the overall functionality of this unit, it was a good buy. Cyber Home has produce a good product at and affordable price."
1,P-Scan Recall Issue,Bad news... These players aparently suffer from a hardware flaw involving the Progressive Scan. Many users report problems involving video quality issues after activating the progressive scan feature (including myself). To solve please go to CyberHome's website and click on support to RMA your player. Unfortunately a firmware upgrade will not help this.
4,Great value,"The is the 2nd CyberHome DVD player I have purchased. I use them to play DVD-R disks I burn at home. I have 3 combo VCR/DVD players, and find they will not play most of my homemade DVD-R (or +R), but the CyberHome works fine with them."
1,OK while it lasted,"I had this for about a year and I was satisfied with it. I liked the MP3 player interface compared to my old Apex player.Last week, it just stopped reading my DVDs. It could still play any CD format (VCD,SVCD,MP3 CD). I tried to contact Cyberhome several times through their website and I never got a response back so I would caution those who are thinking of buying any of their products about Cyberhome's poor customer support."
1,"Looks, feels and works GREAT. . . for a few months!","I experienced the same as many previous reviewers. And just like one of them, I bought two of these units. One quit working after about 6 months of VERY LIGHT USE. I'll bet I played less than 15 movies with it. It said ""Bad Disk"" with any disk I loaded.The other lasted a bit longer but after having a baby we used it less than the first one. Now this one turns on, but there is no response from the buttons on the bezel or the remote.I bought these after reading great reviews. Don't make the same mistake! Check out the reviews on their other products. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company."
2,Not what I expected....,"I read so many reviews about Cyberhome and thought I'll jump on the deal, but I'm not impressed at all. Seems it doesn't read the disc too well or makes my DVDs skip alot. I watch my movies on the Sony DVD player and it's fine! Also, the disc tray is a bit slow on opening.I'm gonna jump in on the Norcent DP-302v and see how that goes."
2,Piece of Crap,"I bought this a year ago, probably used for 25 hrs max (since I had another DVD player also). This is broken already.I don't advice people to buy this."
1,Sorry I choose you,Your player only plays one type of dvd that I have. I brought it here to Belize thinking that it was a good player..I won't advise anyone to purchase one. Please correct your scanner to be capable to scan any dvd disc. Jacqui
1,God-Awful,"I bought this dvd player based only on the reviews I read here. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out those reviews were planted by Cyberhome. This dvd player locked up and froze one or more times with EVERY dvd I tried to play. This might very well explain the low price. Suggestions: (1) Spend a few more bucks and get a dvd player that works; and/or (2) if, like me, you've already bought this turkey, wrap it up and give it to your mother-in-law for Christmas."
2,Does not play DVD -/+R,I bought CyberHome CH-DVD 200 Progressive-Scan DVD Player. It is good DVD player for $29.00. This model does not play DVD +/- R you can not burn MP3 songs or video or JPEGs in to DVD +/- R and play in this player. The buttons on the player have to be pressed hard to function.It is JUST OK.
1,Quality is not that good.,"I have this player for about one year. It playsall kind of DVD/VCD/CD disks, and it can be made region free.However, The player started to overheat and frozen recently , and it has problems reading some disks. I cleaned the player with a lens cleaner disk, but it did not help.Looks like it is dying. My Old Pioneer player still works after more than 3 years.It was a nice machine, but it did not last."
3,Good value,"The other reviews about it being a good value are true. One little problem - if you want to use a universal remote with it, you are out of luck - does not work with any universal remote per their web site."
1,It's in the trash,"I bought one two years ago and it went out of service 13 months later. I could see only 15 DVDs. It was impossible to find any spare part of that player. So, I lost all I paid for it."
5,PRICELESS FOR THE PAL CONVERSION,"i cant sing enough praise for this player.i have had mine for 2 years,and still going strong.i purchased originally as a back-up player,but now use it as my primary dvd player.the feature that many may not know about or understand,is the ntsc to pal conversion(and vice versa).this allows you to view dvds from ANY region/country in the world!!to do the same thing back in the vhs days would set ya back around a grand!"
2,Sub Woofer channel,"I've used this player off and on for about a year and have no complaints other than the sub woofer channel apprears not to work. Tried every possibility and after reading these reviews, I think it is the player. If anyone has had a similar problem, please contact me. I'll probably buy another player and see if the problem corrects itself."
3,Not many extra features over the CH-DVD 300,I purchased couple of ch-dvd 300 players from amazon before.I could not resist the look of the ch-dvd 500 and got one. But I did not find any advantage over the lower end model. Actually the 300 series could play some DVD's which were not readable in this model.
1,Cyberhome = Garbage with out the bag.,"CyberHome = Worst quality products.Email CyberHome three times. No response.They don't support their products.I used mine 15-20 hours over the year I owned it and it died.Didn't really die, somehow it's codec disappeared andit just cant play anything now. Re-programming via the remotecontrol doesn't work for more than a minute on a Region Free orat all on a Region 1 (USA/Canada) DVD. File on their websitecouldn't be downloaded. Email went unanswered."
1,Dont buy it sucks broke after 20 dvd watched,"i get this free when i bought my big tv from best buy no wonder why is free, retail was 79.99 dollars. i use it briefly and one night i watched dvd and i full sleep in morning i tried it but not working just green lcd lights out no function, i know electronics so i opened it and looked not repairable easyi emailled cyberhome they would charge me for labornot worth it stupid me to buy chinesse product communism products sucks"
1,"Sometimes it works, sometimes not!","It plays some DVDs, but refuses to play others (won't play Cats or Finding Nemo). It sometimes freezes for up to 30 seconds and then continues. It is very slow to start a disc or select any options. The remote buttons are small and poorly placed.I would like to get my money back for this piece of junk but I did not take it out of the box and discover its shortcomings until after 30 days ;-(I would avoid this product at any price."
5,Fantastic piece of hardware,"I've had this DVD player for over a year. I have upgraded the BIOS twice. I have it set as region 0 (in other words, region free). There are tutorials on the internet on what you need to do to make it region 0. It's just in a hidden menu.I play this thing to death, and have only ever had one problem with it. The problem was with ""Anger Management,"" but I flashed the BIOS the the new version, and everything was perfection again.The new BIOS is available from Cyberhome's official web site. All you need to do is download the ISO (disc image), use an ISO burning program (nearly every popular CD burning program will do this) to burn the CD, put it in your DVD player, follow some instructions, and there you go, BIOS flashed. Easy.The only complaint I could have with this is the lack of DVD-A support. But, it came out before that was available.I play US DVDs, imported Asian and European DVDs, mp3 CD-Rs, audio CDs / CD-Rs, VCDs, xVCDs, SVCDs, xSVCDs; all of them play beautifully."
1,It's a piece of junk!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought two of these DVD's from Sams Club because of the great price that they were. We loved them at first, and thought they were very user friendly compared to another higher priced DVD player we had in the past. The first one quit working after about 7 months, and the second one literally ""BLEW UP"" after 9 months! Sparks, popping and everything. I wish I had read these other reviews before buying. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Won't even power on,"After purchasing this item from amazon.com and waiting two weeks for its arrival, I set it up only to find that it will not power on. The company's website offers advice to check the a/c connector and thats it! No other advice, no help at all. This machine is a waste of time and money"
1,Don't waste your time with Old Technology,"The bottom line - this display is unacceptable for playing video games or watching DVDs! I am currently running with an ATI Radeon 9800 with DVI to this LCD. When stationary, the picture looks great, however the 20ms response time makes Counter Strike unpleasant, and Far Cry nauseating to play. Turning around inside or outside becomes a blur. The walls on either side of a cooridor becomes a blur when running through. Watching DVDs is very do-able, but during fast sequences, especially when the background is spinning quickly you can't make out anything.Those who reviewed this monitor and said the response time was un-noticable when using the DVI input were wrong. It truly boggles me how they came to this conclusion. This is old technology, and should not be purchased!"
3,Children's movie,"This preview was representative of the movie. A silly, children's movie with a few things thrown out to the parents who must patiently accompany them to these special events. A 78 year old couple wanted to see the DVD because they love Gilbert and Sullivan (cf. ""The Pirates of Penzance""). Gilbert and Sullivan it is not. And not surprisingly they were disappointed by the movie. This preview shows what you can expect."
4,works great for storage,"I like the bankers boxes because I can slap a label on them and they utilize space well in my garage or storage closet. They stack well, I gave 4 stars because the lids should have a better folding design, but if you don't rush while building them they look and fit perfect."
2,SNAP-LOCK boxes,"These are Snap-Lock style boxes. That means that when you jerk opposite corners to open the flat box, the bottom forms from extensions of the sides/ends that unfold, overlap, and ""lock"" together. Very fast and easy to assemble(and knock down).These are just fine for normal storage. (Pack it, stash it, only rarely need the contents.)I have LOTS of books and little space. Using banker boxes I can fit the contents of several book cases into the space of only one. The problem is that books are heavy and I am always shuffling the boxes (whatever I want is usually at the bottom). Snap-Lock bottoms will not stand up to this kind of usage (frequent lifting of heavy weight). In my experience, by the time I've moved a box about a dozen times, the Snap-Lock bottom is failing.If I had known these were Snap-Lock style boxes I would not have bought them."
4,d,"boxes are as described. However, if you are even remotely green concious, the boxes came in a box which amazon then put in another box. Wasteful."
2,A disappointment!,"I thought this book had a lot of promise. I enjoyed a previous book by this author. But, shortly after beginning this book, I started to get a bad feeling. I feel that it went too long with Marshall only wanting Evelyn as a mistress. In other books with the same premise, (and I can't think of a good example right now), it didn't go clear until the end before the hero realized he loved his mistress. I don't enjoy books such as this one where there is only a physical bond. I know he did wonderful things for Evelyn, but Marshall never looked at her as a future wife until the end. I know this book has received high marks so many people have enjoyed it. I may just be too fussy and picky, but I felt Evelyn was a victim and had to be too grateful to her rescuer. I guess I should stick to books where the two leads are a little more equal in status. It might leave a better taste in my mouth."
2,... :/,works ok if your shutting garage but bad reception. i have to get out of my car to open it. Don't get this
4,Pavarotti,a good collection of music that shows the quality of Pavarotti's voice and knowledge of the genre.
2,This should say Child Size!,The quality of the t-shirt is low and the size is tiny! I ordered a medium size for a small sized person and this probably won't fit her. It is more like an extra small than a medium.
5,Greatest album of the nineties?,"This album would easily make it into my all-time top-ten record and is Tindersticks perhaps finest moment.Some say that singer Stuart A Staples voice is one to eigher love or hate but I have troubles understanding how anyone can do other than love it. The songs, instrumentation, production, moods are all exellent but it is Staples voice that gives this record that special feeling.Anyone into melancholic, moodfull, dreamy, bittersweet or passionate music should give tindersticks a try immediately. Among similar artist Nick Cave, Lee Hazlewood and 70's soul singers as Curtis Mayfield can be mentioned.There are no weak songs on this album but absolute highlights are:""Bathtime"", ""Let's Pretend"", ""Rented Rooms"", ""Dancing"" and ""Are you trying to fall in love again""."
5,That missing piece in your life,"After discovering Tindersticks with the second album years ago, I started to classify the music world as Tindersticks and the others. Their music fills that hollow space in my life that I didn't even know existed. Curtains is surely a masterpiece but it is so hard to stop listening to their music once you start, that you will be craving for more and more."
1,Cacophony. A waste of hard earned money.,"I didn't know what to expect, but I had high hopes for this CD. I was intrigued by the sound of the Tindersticks when the movie ""Nenette Et Boni"" was reviewed on NPR -- they played a haunting Tindersticks instrumental from the movie in the background. I tried in vain to find the soundtrack, and could only find this CD by them. So I gave it a try.Uggh, if there is lousier, more discordant, non-sensical, pretentious CD out there I don't want to hear it. While they do seem to know how to play their respective instruments quite competantly, they don't seem to have any interest in fusing their meandering playing styles into anything discernable. Perhaps they're under the influence of different hallucinogenics.I would have given it 0 stars if possible, but track # 5 is so awful it gets a good laugh out of me."
2,Pass,I got the spanish cuts. Jeweller is a worthy listen and I like 'End of the World'. Don't worry about this one. Cry is the better choice if you are starved for new minds. Of course you could always spin the old 'Sparkle' or 'New gold' discs for old heat.
3,Nice watch but not very sturdy,"The watch band broke within a week after I bought it. Since only the moving parts of the watch are under warrenty, it's sitting on my dresser unusable. I liked it a lot for the first week. After that, not so much."
1,Buyer Beware,"There is no doubt that this is a gorgeous watch, but given the chance I wish I had read the first two reviews before making my purchase. When I received the watch, the battery was dead. Then after only 6 days of wearing it, the band broke. I'm hoping that a jeweller will be able to fix it, otherwise I will be out $130. ESQ makes a beautiful watch ladies, but I would strongly advise against purchasing the Damsel."
2,Seconds?,This is an excellent product when bought fresh; trying to save money I ordered it online and what I got was just old and withered enough to disappoint me. It's back to retail for me.
1,wow,"Space age thriller, simply amazing. very many details and very real feeling situations make this a great book"
2,"Looks Great, Quality terrible","We bought this phone for our daughter to have in her room. How cute we thought... Well it is very cute to look at, but to use as a phone its terrible. The sound quality is awful. We actually get echoes when talking on it. And we are constantly hanging up on people as is our daughter as the hangup button is right where you would have your cheek on the phone. So for looks its great, for a phone not so good."
3,Princess Disney phone,"This is a cute phone with musical rings and not bad for the price. But I do have a few complaints. The ring tones are very loud even on the lowest setting. Its also very easy to hang up, my cheek hits it, hang up, I yawn, hang up, cant do anything while holding the phone... and doesnt have a plug for hands free headset. I also get static if I move around while using it. Its still a good phone but may not have been my first choice had I known the downfalls."
1,"Cute, but it just isn't practical...",I bought this phone to use in my bedroom. It was just so cute I couldn't resist. But it has several major problems. First the sound quality is awful. The only place you can hear without a ton of static is in the room where the base is. Also it's very easy to hang up on the person you are talking to because of the position the buttons are in. I've hung up on people 2 to 3 times in one conversation. Overall I am not satisfied with this product. I don't recomend it.
1,junk,"this stuff is garbage it dont spray right,also even if you have a fan in the window you get overspray all over.if you really want to use this stuff make sure to mask off all your walls from floor to ceiling and make sure you take out or cover everything in the bathroom"
2,Generic and Uninspiring,"This film version of the great St. Anthony of Padua is quite disappointing in that it misses the real essence of this incredible saint, and presents him as some kind of ""revolutionary"" and corruption seeker, even going after Church officials, etc.Sorry, the real Saint Anthony was a very holy, learned man who loved God and man devoutly and wholeheartedly, a deeply spiritual,prayerful man whose closeness to almighty God gave him even miraculous powers to heal the sick, raise the dead, and convert the most hardened sinners. He was not a ""warrior"" or a ""revolutionary"" - he was a great Saint, one who closely imitated Christ.A much better film version is the film ""SAINT ANTHONY"", starring Italian actor Daniele Liotti, also available on Amazon."
2,not good,not well done at all - not velar to understand many things - would not recommend it and in fact we got rid of it immediately after watching it the first time -
1,inaccurate and dull,"What more is there to say that isn't in the title of this review. St. Anthony has been a special patron in our family for over 20 years, and watching this film...inaccurate and dull. I cannot provide examples as I saw this movie a while ago, but the feeling of absolute disgust has not left me. I haven't seen any other movies on St. Anthony, so I'm afraid I cannot recommend one in this one's stead. :-("
5,Greatest space flight ever!,This is the story of the Voyager space probes. Very well told and an excellent story about early space exploration. Great discoveries were made and the mission was a great success. This video is a must for anyone wanting to learn more about the Solar System!
4,Good introduction to the outer solar system,"I also show this one in my astronomy courses. I like the pacing and topic coverage, and that the science is described in fairly aaccurate terms. The only drawback from the student's point of view is that the video is a bit dated, and not as flashy as, say, the ""Universe"" episodes on Jupiter and Saturn that have the more current information from the Galileo and Cassini probes."
4,It's ok,"This was just an ok book . The search stopped when I found the homilrtical plot by Eugene l. Lowry . If you have problems with getting people to listen its most likely due to deductive style of preaching . And you preach that way because you were taught to do so . The fact of the matter is Jesus never taught that way ,and we don't communicate that way in real life we just don't . Find any and every book on inductive preaching and things will change . The next. Book that I strongly recommend is communicatin for a change by Andy stanley . If you could only buy one book on inductive preaching t would be that one ."
2,Poor quality control,"I recently bought a pack of these, thinking $11.37 was quite a bargain for a dozen Zebra gel-ink pens. I've generally had good experiences with Zebra gel pens in the past, and even with this very product in the past--the flow is not as generous as the Pilot gel pens, so they tend to smear less. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed to find that the click mechanism on most of the barrels was defective. I tossed them, keeping only the refills. Not recommended; buyer beware.Edit: In retrospect, I am looking over the pens again. The last package I purchased about a year ago contained pens made in Japan. The batch I just received was made in Mexico, barrel, ink refill and all. I suppose that explains the difference. I won't be buying these again."
3,"Wonderful when new, but they start skipping too soon.","I like the fine tip for a neater hand, and I have to write very quickly on a variety of paper-types. The pen is comfortable hold, very light, feels a bit ""cheap"" but the point is, well, the point of a pen, and this one's point is very, very good for the price. I have a medium sized hand.Edited after using half the box: These start skipping when the ink gets about halfway down. I'm not going to get them again."
2,Click mechanism doesn't work.,"I've used and liked Zebra pens in the past and I like the ink flow and 0.5mm option, however in 4 of the 12 pens I purchased the click mechanism is dodgey and either takes several tries to retract or the tip won't retract at all.I've called Zebra but they haven't returned a call to see if this is a bad batch or if there is a better option."
5,Great product,"After extensive research I decided on this model and I'm so happy I did.It is very easy to use but you must get familiar with the manual. I love manuals. After I hooked it up to my HDTV, which was very easy,all I did was play DVD's. Great picture and sound and great menu. There are many adjustments you can make if you choose. I really bought this to transfer wedding tapes to disc's because I have a DVR cable box.The recording went very well and the transfer easy. There is nothing so far that I can complain about.But I still pick up the manual and read because every time I do it seems I discover something else I can do and I love that. The price was a little more than many player/recorders but I think it was well worth it."
4,Better than most,Excellent device with amazing clarity. The only fault is the manual is short on detail in some areas while overly detailed on others.
1,Very Poor Locks Up,"I have this for over 6 months and it locks up when I use the remote tochange channels too fast or other functions, I have to unplug it to getit back, and yes I have update the firmware. It takes over 3 seconds tochange channels if you press the channel up/down too fast it locks upand you have to unplug to cycle the power. The analog tuner can nottake a strong signal on channels 7 and 9, I had to put a 10db pad in."
1,JUNK,"I have had this VCR for 1.5 yrs now and most of the time the VCR doesn't record timer programs. When I turn it on,it now takes 5 minutes just to be ready.The first 6 months it worked great but now it doesn't.As of 2 months ago the DVD drive stopped working.I have always been a Panasonic fan but this is just a big piece of crap-DON'T BUY!! It is a waste of money. I now have to replace it already."
1,Terrible Version of Tombraider,"My two sons and I had both enjoyed the first two Tombraider releases for Mac, playing them all the way through several times. In stark contrast, this Tombraider AOD is terrible. We had to write to the game developers for a valid serial number. It has jerky, stilted animation, poor response on the controls, coupled with what seems to be a growing fetish on the game developers' parts to interact with criminals and ganglanders. Neither my sons nor I finished the game. It ended up in both the virtual trash and the real trash."
1,I can't play it,"This game is sooo stupid. It doesn't work on my computer, in fact I've tried to install it on three of my other friends computers and it doesn't work on any of them! I would say not to take a chance by buying it itf there is a chance it won't even work."
4,inexpensive but not as expected,"I was looking for good organic coconut and this sort of fit the bill. The flakes are LARGE (about 1/2 inch by 1 inch), not really the sort of thing that's easy to use in baking or cooking. I'll have to figure out how to shred it now. It's not sweetened which is a PLUS, but it also wasn't super duper fresh, at least it that's how it tastes. It's A LOT of coconut for the price. I have so much I have to invent new dishes to use it all."
5,Quality product,"I have tried several organic coconut flakes, this is a superior product and pricing from Amazon is very good. Highly recommend."
4,Good Food,"This is really tasty, not sugary tasting flakes. I have cooked with it and I eat it right out of the package! GOOD STUFF"
5,Bella!,"Being a huge fan of Italian cooking (and quite a good novice in my own right) I was very eager to find a good cookbook on the subject especially after returning from a month long culinary tour of the pennisula in November. Well, I hit the jackpot when a friend presented me with a copy of Gastronomy of Italy. It is a simple, beautifully written and presented book on the foods of Italy. Anybody who is looking for a really good book on Italian cooking need look no further than this. I spent over 3 hours on the first evening just savoring the recipes and drooling over the photographs!! Bella! Enjoy. Scott"
1,Useless...,"I don't even know why I go to this manual anymore. Today, after having some difficulty in pulling the starter out of my 280C, I went to the manual to see if there were any particulars that I may have missed...In three paragraphs, the manual basically told me to mark my wires (placement & order), that I may have to turn the wheel to the left or right (model dependant) and that I should unbolt it from the motor.No kidding. (So how do I get to the topmost bolt on the starter that I can't even see? Do I need to go ahead and yank the exhaust manifold off or what?)There are no wiring diagrams, no detailed information on body works (info on power windows, sun roof, etc...) and little to no detailed info on the drive line. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Haynes manuals, but please don't waste your time with this book."
1,Useless,"As the owner of a 1981 and a 1984 Mercedes 300SD, I find this manual absolutely useless. I have recently attempted to find information about the operation of power windows, the engine cooling system and the air conditioning system only to be frustrated by the total lack of any information about these systems in my children's vehicles. I'm currently looking for an manual for these vehicles more along the line of the user friendly, informative Hayne's manuals I had been used to."
1,Common Sense Will Help You More,"After many persuals of the appropriate sections of this book, I was at every bit as much a loss to troubleshoot and perform preventative maintenance on my Benz as before. This book reads as if culled from a generic template, with alterations added on to appease the series' editors--not as though it were the product of experienced mechanics and engineers familiar with and fond of the ways of the Mercedes. I started troubleshooting and tuning up my car twenty years ago with the help of books, and this manual left me wanting to strangle the writers. Pass it by."
2,WHERE'S THE DIESEL INFO AT ??,THIS BOOK HAS ALMOST NO INFOMATION ON THE DIESEL MODELS LISTED ON THE COVER VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK STILL LOOKING FOR ANOTHER ONE THAT DOES A BETTER JOB
3,Alternatives,"Anyone looking for information that is actually useful, and finds the Chilton manual less than so (and especially people that the more useful Haynes manuals don't cover, like drivers of 115 diesels) should be aware that Mercedes sells their shop manuals on CD for around $100.Spendy (and still imperfect), but THE best source of information on the subject short of finding a paper shop manual secondhand or apprenticing yourself to a master Mercedes mechanic."
3,Recommended,"Recommended by Toad Hall Motorbook as an inexpensive and clear alternative to complicated factory manuals. Since I'm ordering it now, write me in a few days and I'll let you know how it is!"
3,Help?,"I just want to know if this book helps you to do some trouble shooting before things happen, like a consumer report would, like brakes go bad fast etc...My parents just bought one and could use some help on getting them a book, my dad knows how to work on them but needs a good guide. thanks for your time :)"
1,no good,"Not a good churro maker, I used it twice, the second time while i was pressing it, the front ring fell of on the hot oil and it melted. So I couldn't use it again."
5,A stunning CD,"Diane Reeves, where have you been all of my life? Your smooth and silky voice is perfect when I need a little mood music. Turn down the lights, open a glass of wine and enjoy this phenomenal lady!"
4,Green Yourself,"If you weren't around back in the day of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers featuring Peter Green, or Peter Green's original Fleetwood Mac, this is the next best thing. As others have said, it captures Green's sound almost perfectly. As far as I know, Gary Moore still owns and sometimes plays Peter's old Les Paul with the reversed neck pickup, and it's still a great, great sound. I'm not as fond of Moore's vocals in Peter's place, but they're still pretty darn good on most tracks. ""Sing on singer, play on drummer""..."
3,Lacks imagination,"Peter Green and Gary Moore are fantastic musicians and I completely understand Gary's admiration for Peter but... Why just replicate Peter's studio recordings with a virtual note-for-note cover, including vocals??? If that's all he's going to do, what's the point? The 3 stars is for the ONE exception and that's ""Looking For Somebody"". Finally, at the end of the CD, Gary gets creative."
3,Good Try,"Gary Moore owns/uses Peter Green's actual early guitar. He tries hard to reproduce the magic of Peter Green's music but only succeeds on one track - the supernatural. In general this album disappoints. Listen to the original Peter Green recordings that Gary Moore imitates on this album to see what I mean. The originals are just that, original, fresh and broke new ground. Peter Green was one of a kind and unfortunately Gary Moore while techincally good, does not add anything new to Green's brilliance."
3,for completists only,"Gary Moore is an excellent guitar player, but no one does Peter Green (not even Peter himself these days)..stick to the Peter Green original versions. Gary does use Peter's guitar which is cool but not his amp or his fingers...just not the same, and at the same time, not different."
5,A Rare Jewel,"I was looking for some new age music and just happened to pick up this album. But this music goes beyond just the new age genre, a rare jewel indeed. Clara Ponty's classical background serves her well as she composes and performs this fresh new music. At times one can hear the spirit of a Brahms intermezzo, sometimes a hint of Ravel or Debussy, sometimes Schumann, and yet even sometimes a hint of Michael Jones. But this music is really none of these. It is Clara Ponty's music. Her compositions and performance reflect not only musicianship, but an indication of a kind of peaceful beauty that most of us can only dream of. They will sound as clear and fresh 50 years from now as they do today."
4,she plays so beautifully!,i really enjoy this CD. i play it all the time. it is very hard to find good music of this calibur.
2,Marginal recording,"Pretty music, sure... but nothing to move me towards anything. I get no feelings from this tinkle-tinkle recording."
5,American Voices,I purchased this book for my mom for Christmas--she has a keen interest in the different dialects around our country. She calls me weekly to tell me something new she has learned--she keeps reading and re-reading the book! She cannot tell me enough how much she loves this book!
4,For Anne Rice Fans,"I purchased this CD because I thought it was a tribute to Anne Rice novels, which it is but only for her novel Violin. Makes sense now, but at the time I was expecting something more encompassing of her work. Still an excellent CD, but in case anyone else might not want to feel misled..."
3,review,"Good CD. Josefowicz is amazing. The Sting piece is solid and quite catchy. Don't quite see the connection to vampires, but that's okay."
3,It's been established she can play the Tchaikovsky.....,"Don't get me wrong when I say that, she is very talented, but she all ready made a recording of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. There were a few new things on this CD which she was great at, but those two other tracks, one at the beginning, one at the end, were very annoying. They aren't classical! If she wants to do stuff with jazz, then she should make an individual CD for it. Overall, she displayed her talent, but most of that CD was a waste for me."
2,BLECCH.,"Although nicely painted and might make a good shelf model, this model fades, yellows, and marks up too easily. This isn't designed to be educational, btw."
5,Wicked Tinkers,"I LOVE these guys! Celtic Rock has got to be the best music there is. The Wicked Tinkers can make a place come to life. So upbeat and dynamic, I have all their CDs and I have seen them live many, many times. This is a fun CD! Deva"
1,Music? Please...,"I have been attending scottish events for 7 years, and I always hear this band playing. They are great people, but their music is far from great. If you desire more musicality than loud abnoxious drumming... nay... bashing, check out the band Bad Haggis. If you liked the music on Braveheart, you will love them."
2,adapters for iPod Nano - 5th generation,"There's not enough room between the inputs to plug in the car adapter & the plug to play through the car speakers at the same time! Being able to play my iPod through the car speakers without wearing down the iPod battery is the reason that I bought this ""set""."
4,Works as stated,The part came pretty quickly. I've used it a couple of times to charge an older iPod nano and it has worked just fine. Rolls up small so it's easy to store. Great product.
3,Try It?,"One reason I bought this was because it was so cheap. If this serves your needs, try it. I had a problem with the retractable hotsync cable. I could not connect my iPod to my computer using it. It didn't unravel and ravel back up very nice either. However, the company issued me a full refund for my troubles."
3,cheaply made universal ipod,"The universal apple ipod adapter was cheaply made,the price was right. This is the first time I believe you get what you pay for, however it is doing it's purpose. For how long I don't think it will last 6 months."
1,Horrible Buy,"Well at first i thought it was to good to be true a bunch of i pod charging accesorys for 3 bucks and some change and i bought it and well it was true.This product is the most home made looking, feeling and operating peice of crap. Extremely cheap plastic and not to mention mine was pretty dirty with brown dirt marks all over it lol. It really wouldnt surprie me if some guy in china is crafting these out of random recycled electronics. If i were you i would not buy this or even consider buying it for you or a gift for a friend this product is HORRIBLE."
5,Buy It !,"Wow!! I read the reviews and people said it worked with the iPhone 4 - I was skeptical... Just bought a set at a store for $30 and came across this one on Amazon. Figured it was too good to be true... But for the price, I thought I couldn't go wrong. It WORKS!! I have an iPod Classic, Touch 3rd Generation, and the new 4th Generation iPod Touch and it works with all of them!!!!!!! What an amazing deal!! They are made cheap, but who cares - they work and look at the price!! Needless to say, the set I bought for $30 went back to the store!! I will be buying more of these for sure!"
4,ipod charger kit,this was a great value. it is easy to use and you just cant beat it for the price...
4,iPod charger,"For the price, you can't beat this charger. It coils up so it's easy to bring with you."
5,easy and quick upgrade for old Ipod,that package brought the missing items for a bunch of boks ....in fact few so it is very attractive and works perfectly.
1,NOT for 4G Ipod nano,"I bought this set base on a lot of users reviews saying it charge their Ipod. What I didn't realized is what model ipod they have, they might have a 3G nano. I tried the charger on the car, it works only you can not play and charge at the same time. The house travel charger doesn't work. This is more important to me for my 4G nano. It's not worth returning, the postage cost more than the items."
1,Does not work for my 3rd Generation iPod,"Plug LED lights up, iPod wakes up when I plug it in, but does not charge anything. It actually drained all the remaining power from my iPod overnight leaving me stuck on a business trip without my music and audio books. Did not try car plug as I don't have a car on this trip. Too cheap to hassle with returning. Buyers beware."
5,Universal Apple Ipod USB Charger Kit,"This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so it has not been opened yet. It looks fine in the package. And I received it very fast. So far, so good. Thanks!!"
1,Do not waste your money on this product!,"The car charger stopped charging the ipod 2 days after I got it. I still used it because it provides enough power for the small speakers I have, but to be able to charge my ipod I have to carry a power converter."
4,cheap buy but Excellent quality,"One of the first purchases I made after buying my iPod, gotta have the power so iPod doesn't die"
4,charging,"The charger works fine but it had no directions. As a new user of the ipod as well as this, I had to download ipod instructions to get it to charge for the first time. It would have helped to have had some information with the charge kit on how to get started."
4,"Good product, works as expected...","I purchased this product mostly for the cable because I needed an extra (one for home and one for work). I knew it wasn't original ""Apple"" when purchased, but because of the price I took the risk. I paid enough for my iTouch already that I was nervous to use it for fear of causing a problem. The cable works great, but I haven't used the wall/car plugs yet. I don't really have a use for them because the battery on the iTouch lasts long enough for my use already. I am happy with my purchase, mostly for the price - the retractable part of the cable doesn't do much for me except make it look cheap (in my opinion)."
3,good for the price,it's worth the money spent on it. the connecting cable is cheaply made though. i had one already so i don't use it. i'm afraid it's going to get stuck in my ipod so i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. the other stuff is nice though.
4,Good for the price,"This product is definitely worth more than what it's being sold for. An ideal alternative to the original charger that comes with the iPod. I haven't used the car charger yet, but the normal USB charger works perfectly fine!"
1,Does not work completely,"The car charger portion does not work with my Ipod, only the house charger portion."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this ""inexpensive"" charger for the new ipod Nano I just purchased. First time I used it to charge my ipod, it fried the ipod and it was dead after that. I tried everything, $150 ipod was completely dead from this charger."
2,You get what you pay for,"I added the universal chargers (wall & car) as suggested to my ipod case purchase because they were so inexpensive. While the wall charger works just fine (even though I didn't need it because I already have one) the car charger doesn't work at all! I plugged it in, and the ipod charged for a few seconds, then stopped. I jiggled the cords and made sure that everythig was fully plugged in, but as soon as I let go it wouldn't charge anymore. Save your time: this add-on isn't worth it."
1,Don't waste your money,"You look at this product and its couple of dollars with shipping, so you think you have nothing to loose by buying it. Right ? Yeah, that's what I thought. But this product is so horrible that I had to throw out everything within a month. So, don't even waste a single dollar buying this. It's cheaply made, it doesn't work and pretty soon you will be back in the market to replace it."
2,Buyer Beware!! Doesn't always work!,"This is the cheapest piece of crap that I have ever seen. Cigarette charger was broken upon receiving package, but since I didn't buy it for that I didn't care. Plug in module is cheap, lightweight plastic, which if plugged into wall for long periods of time, will not charge ipod.If taken out of outlet and allowed to cool off, will charge ipod just fine. (most of the time)I do NOT recommend this item, I bought for $0.01 and paid $3.99 shipping and handling. It is not worth anything to send back since I will have to pay to send it back and for what?? A penny?As I said, it works sometimes, don't understand other than (i am guessing) that this cheap chinese made piece of crap overheats and doesn't always work.Your choice."
2,Can't use this product,"I was advised that I should use only Mac products with the iPod, that the product I bought on Amazon would use up the iPod battery too fast."
5,Excellent Item!,"This item came out perfectly, not what I expected for such a cheap price! Definitely worth the price! Came out just as the picture suggests, works great, excellent item!"
1,This kit doesn't work with ipod classic 120Gb!!!,"Don't buy this kit if you intend to use it with ipod classic (specifically ipod classic 120Gb)!!! I have an ipod classic 120Gb. The charger couldn't charge my ipod. I couldn't sync my ipod with my computer using the included usb cable. When I unplugged the wall adapter, there were sparks coming out of the wall outlet. This is a very unsafe product that can potentially destroy your ipod. Just don't buy it. Instead buy a used apple's charger (plus the usb cable) for just $10 more on ebay."
2,Unhappy,"I bought this product specifically to charge my new Ipod Touch 3rd Gen. After quite a bit of research I purchased this product, appeared in the list every time I searched for ""Ipod Touch 3rd Generation accessories."" A few days ago, I plugged another Ipod into the wall charger and it worked fine. However, last night I plugged the new Ipod in and the screen stated something to the effect ""Will not charge with unsupported device."" Unfortunately for me, that means that this accessory does not fulfill the only purpose for which I bought it. I am not sure if that means that all 3 parts to this package won't work --- wall charger, car charger and USB cord --- but I plan to try them later today. I just wanted anyone searching the same way that I did for a good deal on an accessory to be aware that it doesn't appear to work as advertised."
1,Shocking,"Very first time I plugged in the AC adapter, I smelled something burning and when I pulled it from the wall, one of the prongs came out and stuck in the outlet. After turning off the circuit I pulled the prong out with pliers and threw out what was left of the AC charger as well as the car charger and cable. I can't afford to ruin my $[...] Ipod nano over this piece of crap."
1,Terrible quality and didn't work,Don't waste your $2.98. This charger kit is flimsy and didn't even charge either of the two ipods I connected to it regardless of where I had it plugged in. Save your time and money and invest in something of a higher quality!
2,Not for all ipods,The ipod charger works very well on my ipod video. the fact that it is a universal adapter is really nice to be able to charge it when i drive or when im at home. the only thing that i dont like is that it is called a univeral ipod charger when it doesnt charge my ipod touch. when you plug it into the ipod touch it says incompatible with with hardware. luckily i bought it for just 90 cents so its good for the price but disappointing that it doesnt work with all ipods.
1,Broken during the first time use,"It is inexpensive, but the quality is bad. The connector to iPod was broken during the first time use. Not recommended."
4,nice charger for ipod,This is a great charger that allows for use in almost any location. I love it for work and in the car. Good price!
2,Universal Apple iPod USB Charger Kit - USB Retractable Hotsync Cable - USB Home Travel Charger - USB 12V Cigarette Lighter Charg,This was a disappointment. The USB cable would not release and I had to destroy it to disconnect it from my iPod Touch. The other components were functional however. Based on my experience I would not recommend this.
3,"No so great, but does the basic job...","The Plastic body is not so great, but it does the job required... I did not tried the feature ""over charging prevention"" by way of a chip, which the seller says. But it does the job, charging both Wall Charging and in Car. The look and appeal is also not so great. The cable is ok, not too weak."
5,Universal Apple ipod USB charger kit,I don't understand why people will go out and pay so much for these accessories. I found this product to be a lot cheaper then it's competitors and works great. I've had no problems hooking things up.
5,ipod combo charger,"This is great, car charger and home charger in one. No need to buy 2 items. Works well. Would recommend it."
5,An inexpensive but great product.,I love this charger set. It gets the job done either in the car or at home without getting tangled up with all of you other chargers when you put it away. The best part....it doesn't cost all that much! I've seen some sets that do the same thing that are $50 or more. I bought one for me and then my wife wanted one for her...so she took mine and I bought another.
2,Does this thing work?,"I have an ipod classic and I don't know if this charger is actually working or not as the icon on my iPod does not change when plugged in. It seems to be working as the iPod does not lose its charge as rapidly, but maybe it is not getting a full recharge? I recommend you try something else."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"Nothing worked. The cable that was suppose to work with most iPods didn't charge any of ours. I even tried switching the cables with the new adaptor but nothing worked. I did contact the seller and they gave me a refund, but would have preferred the product to work :("
2,Doesn't last,"It worked fine when i bought it and used it for a few months. About 6 months down, it just silently died. The red light still comes on but doesn't charge. Don't buy this."
2,Cheaply made,"Retractable portion broke within a month of getting it for use. Also, the cord is a USB on one end and apple connector on the other, but the USB end only seems to work with the included adaptor, not others. Since there are so many universal adaptors out there, it would be really nice if they worked with others."
1,Got what I paid for...,"Got this to charge an iPod Touch 2G. When I connect to the wall charger, the charge icon flashes between 'charging' and 'fully-charged', even though it's nowhere near a full charge. If I try to operate it while plugged in, the touch interface is erratic and not useable.The car charger worked perfectly the first time, but then did the same as the wall charger after that. I'm currently using the retractable cable w/ my new car stereo, which has a front usb port. The cable is working great!"
4,Good cheap iPod kit.,"This is my second set. It is so convenient and since I have 4 different ipod, I needed two set to have one in each car and each room. This is a must have accessory for ipod owner. Don't buy those expensive usb accessory from apple!"
1,"Total Junk, avoid!","Spend a few more dollars and buy something that works, this is VERY poor quality and even if it works for a few weeks it will soon die. Mine is in the garbage and I am back to ordering a real set."
1,Does not work for ipod touch 3rd generation,"I thought it was Universal as it's been advertised, but I was wrong. When I plug it on the wall a message shows that this device is not supported by ipod touch. I bought another one from Amazon, which looked similar as this one but a little bit expensive (~$10) and it worked. A good lesson: You Get What You Paid."
1,KEEP AWAY,"HOW GREAT I THOUGHT, NEVER RUN LOW ON BATTERY LIFE OF IPOD NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, HOME OR IN YOUR CAR. UNFORTUNATELY THE HOME PLUGS ARE TRASH, I PURCHASE THREE SET, SAME PROBLEM WITH TWO OF THE SET, THE PRONGS ON THE PLUG PRONGS COMES OFF, THE PRONGS REMAIN STUCK IN WALL SOCKET CAUSING A POWER OUTAGE. BURNED OUT TWO IPOD TOUCHES, KEEP FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IF YOU VALUE YOUR IPOD OR ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Amazon messed up.,I typed in Ipod Nano and this is first item that comes up. Does not work for Ipod Nano.
3,Great product but wasn't for my iPhone,This is a great product if you have an iPhone that doesn't have a Otter box around it. I couldn't get it to fit. My sons use it to charge their iPods. I was really disappointed that I wasn't able to use this product with my iPhone. I got it at a fabulous price! At least someone in our house can.
2,Hit and miss,"I bought two of these because they were so inexpensive, but as always, you get what you pay for. The cords don't connect well with the ipod touches. However, if you use a traditional cord, they are good for charging in the car and in a plug. I would buy it again, but only for the car piece. Make sure you have a working cord."
1,Pay The Extra Money To Get One That Works,"Do not purchase this item, it works at first, then dies after a few weeks. Does not charge the iPhone 3G. Pay the extra money and get one that works."
1,You get what you pay for!,"All parts arrived as advertised. The retractable usb cable is the best (and only good) thing about this product.The wall plug adapter shorted out (with bright electrical arcing visible through the white plastic casing, and a strong burning smell) the very first time I plugged it in.Stay away from this product. It is not worth the risk."
3,Works and Doesn't,"I purchased two of these.The cigarette charger works well.The wall charger, Hell i think it drains the battery... It doesnt work well..."
3,MTZ electron novice,The hotsync cable did not fit the dock and had to be replaced. The new one works.The seller was efficient and courteous in handling the problem. They sent a replacement one along with a return postage label. The new one works. It did take an extra 1 week for the handling and the mailing despite their efficiency.
1,Don't Bother,I bought these for a dollar something when they were grouped together with antoher product. Don't bother. They are bulky. They are sitting in a drawer right now. Apple makes a much better adapter.
4,Works with 4th Generation Ipod Nano!!!,Bought this for my daughter to charge her 8GB Ipod Nano 4th Generation. Works fine & the price was incredible!!!
1,Doesn't Work,"I thought the price was insanely good, would have been nice to know the Shipping & Handling was just as much. I plugged the car charger into my iPhone 3GS and the device said it couldn't use this accessory...NOW if I want to return the item I don't get my S&H back and there is an excessive restocking fee of 30%++"
2,The only thing worth it is the retractable usb cord,"it came seperatly packaged and the moment i took the car charger out of the plastic bag it came in, it literally fell apart in my hands. i then checked the wall adapter and found that it interfered with my iPod Touch, when i tried to unlock the screen, i couldnt because the bar kept resetting to the side, i unplugged it and it worked fine so it was the wall adapter. like i said the only thing good about this is the retractable usb cord, its convenient and it works. you get what you pay for i suppose. seller offered replacements and am waiting on them but not holding my breath."
3,Does not work with iPhone 3G S,"Hard to argue with the price. Works fine with my iPod, my old iPhone 1st Gen, and my girlfriend's iPhone 3G. The car charger does not work with my new iPhone 3G S."
2,Not Iphone Compatible,"If you, like me, were are considering buying this primarily because you want a car charger for your iphone, look elsewhere. While the cable works as a sync and charging cable when connected to your computer, puzzlingly, the car charger does not charge the iphone. It gives a ""this accessory is incompatible with iphone"" message, so it's not simply that the 12v adaptor wasn't working or anything. Oddly, the wall charger does work with the iphone. It's a mystery."
5,"works fine, price is right - go for it","it works fine, and the price is right. I've used the car charger and the wall wart and both are fine.The cable is a bit short but it works.If I ever need another I'm coming back here to order it."
4,Good kit,My boyfriend need a charger kit to his office so we bought this one. Is so useful that I bought another one for me.
1,The product doesn't work. I am still waiting for another you promised you would send to replace the one I bought,"I would like to get the replacement of this product, since the one I bought does not work.Thank you."
1,Flawed Cable Design,"The extensible cable has a designed flaw, every time you pull on the cable you're stressing the ends where the wire comes in contact with the adapter which will become loose and render the product useless."
3,Good buy... better if it all worked:,"The car charger adapter and retracting sync cable are both nice. The AC adapter wall unit doesn't work though. My iPhone lights up and shows the charging screen...but it doesn't charge. The battery actually seems like it drains faster plugged into this unit than it would it I just left it unplugged. For the price paid though, I can't really complain though. ""Get what you pay for"" after all."
4,Gets the job done,"A really good product overall. Despite the fact that they feel cheap, they have held up well. I've been using them for about a year now without any problems."
1,DESTROYED MY NANO,"WALL CHARGER BURNED UP MY NANO FIFTH GENERATION. TOTALLY RUINED IT. I GUESS IF YOU WANT TO BUY A NEW NANO AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT ITS FOR YOU, FOR ME VERY COSTLY STUPID MISTAKE BUYING THIS PRODUCT."
2,worked when new...,"This is one of the lower quality knockoffs on amazon. The cable worked fine, but after a while the car charger stopped. The little red light would go on and off depending how you put it in the cig lighter. It went from intermittent to dead pretty quick once it started acting up.The cable works fine electrically. The retractable mechanism has long since broken but the cable inside still works. without the wind up mechanism working, I see no use for a cable that has a big chunk of plastic attached... so I dont use it anymoreYou can buy this set cheap and get some use out of it for a few months but why bother. Just spend some extra money on something branded that comes with a warranty and keep it longer."
3,Suitable primarily as a last-resort backup,"This is a case where you get what you pay for. These accessories involve very light construction, iffy materials, wiring that is very thin and subject to breaks, and connectors that border on requiring an Act of God to work. The set was purchased to be a cheap backup for an iPod. It stands up to the light demands of this role but is not reliable for more substantial use."
1,don't waste your 3 bucks,"Hi, I bought this 12v recharger to charge my iPhone 4s in my car. I removed the charger from the padded envelope. I plugged the charge into the 12v receptacle in my car. On doing so, the charger split into two pieces where there is a seam bisecting the charger. Quality made, this is not."
3,WARNING - Car Charger Problem,"Everything in this kit works fine except the 12v car charger. The 12v car charger would drain the battery of the device you try to charge. I bought more than one of these kits at the same time so I had more than one of the 12v car chargers to test and they all drained the devices battery. The iPod charger cable works fine to charge when not used with the 12v car charger, but calling it retractable is a stretch. Sometimes it will not retract LOL! This kit is still worth the money though vs. Radio Shack or the Apple store."
4,Great Product !!!,This product is very helpful when chargin ipods in the car or at home.It allows to use any usb ipod cord possible.great product overall.
2,"Very Cheap, Didnt Last",I needed a few chargers for my iPhone and I decided to go with this product. The charges felt poorly made right off the bat but i wasn't going to return them after paying so little. The charges worked for about 2 weeks then would not charge. I would not recommend these chargers.
2,Doesn't work with 3rd gen iPod touch,"Even though product description says specifically that it works with the 3rd generation Touch, it does not. Getting the message saying it is not compatible (when used with the geniuine Apple cord with USB end plugged into charger part). The cord that came with product will not fit into receptacle on iPod Touch, 3rd gen.The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it works fine in charging our 2nd gen iPod Touch and the plug fits in it okay as well."
2,Not great quality,"I had to actually take it apart and fix it, then put it back together. And I don't do that sort of thing for a living or have any background to do so. Afterward, it worked fine, but it seems really cheap and chinsy."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!,the wall charger part of this set is very dangerous. It burned out the board and charging port on two 3rd generation ipod touches. First one burned out and I returned it to Apple not realizing that the charger was at fault. Tried to charge new one with same charger and the same thing happened. Now that I knew what was causing the problem I threw the charger in the garbage. I was very fortunate that Apple replaced the second ipod in such a short period of time. ONCE AGAIN - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! Would give zero stars if I could!
5,Essential,I thought it was great to not have to worry about where I can charge up the I-pod now. I would recommend to any I-pod owner.
3,"Convenient, but doesn't work with all models","My wife and I both have 80G iPods, but this device won't charge hers. Hers is a Classic model (6th generation?) and is thinner than mine with a brushed-look on the front cover. Mine is one generation older than hers and has the glossy front cover with chrome-plated back cover.Aside from that, I really like this set because of its flexibility. I use the retractable USB cord most of the time instead my Apple-provided cable. I don't use the auto-adapter much because I use my Kensington FM transmitter/charger whenever I'm in my truck or travel on long trips in other vehicles. (I LOVE my Kensington!)"
2,good,"the cord doent work with it but is you use the original usb cord it does charge on both of the items, the product got here fast and the seller are very good."
5,Just As Described,"This was just what I needed. No need to be brand new. It works and that's what counts. Great price, too."
1,Classic Junk,Shown with a list price of over 25 dollars and on sale for 2 dollars was too good to be true and like anything that is too good to be true it was not. This item is classic dollar store quality and perhaps worth the 2 dollars and not a penny more. I don't know why I cheeeped out to save a few dollars to plug my 300 dollar ipod into a 50 cent power socket but I did and I will chalk that one up to experience. I had this silly notion that if it was listed on Amazon there was some sort of quality/control/assurance. Oh well - live and learn. :-(
5,Great Product,"It was a great product, last maybe 6 months, and then it broke. Can't ask for much because it was cheap, and it would be no hassle to buy another one."
1,Terrible product,"This is a terrible product. I would not buy it. Not only did it not work well, but it also blew 2 fuses in my car. I do not recommend this product."
1,Its not worth buying!,"Got the product yesterday. Its not worth purchasing since it does not do its basic function right, that is to charge the device without making any humming noise. I plugged it into the device and I get a big humming noise making the device impossible to use. The USB slots are not aligned to the opening. Yet to try and charge the iPod in the car."
4,Good so far,"I am satisfied with this purchase. I use the wall charger almost everyday. It works great. I am not impressed with the retractable USB cable, that is why I gave it 4 stars."
1,did not work!,"This item did not work. I tried it on a number of items, in a number of outlets.The sad part is it would cost more of my time & money than what it is worth to return."
3,"It working good,",when charging the touch screen mess up. Can not controll when charging. But when disconect the charger. My phone work normally.
1,Got what I paid for :<,The car charger is fine but the retractable cord stopped extending the second time i used it. Got what I paid for.
1,good for the trash can,"cheap garbage, barely works. Is ready to break. Works in the wall for my Ipod touch 2nd Gen, but not for my firends....Merry X-mas for them, eh? Don't waste your hard earned money on this cheap crappy garbage. If you really want to give your money away, find a nice charity to donate it to. Not to these crooks. I tried returning it, but it just gives you this 800# to call where no one picks up. BIG SUPRISE!!!If I could give this product a negative 3 stars, I would."
3,Just as ordered.,"Arrived quickly. Tried all pieces - seem to be OK. Wall charger seemed to work OK - haven't really ""used"" car charger, yet. (Just plugged it in to see if it said ""charging."") Cable plugged into iPod without force. Hope cable will hold up (pretty ""fragile"" feeling). Bought iPod for use on the boat in summer, so can't make a final judgment on quality of all parts in this package until more use."
2,Does not work if you use a case on your ipod or iphone two thumbs DOWN,"This product does not work if you use a case on your ipod or iphone. The plug in for the cord is bigger than a normal apple made one and will not fit through the opening of the case. The good news? I already had a cord so the car charging plug was still beneficial, but if you are looking for a cord to keep in your car and have any sort of case on your item it won't work. All in all, I give it two thumbs WAY DOWN!!"
1,Doesn't charge the iPod,"Gave it a shot because the price was so good but it just didn't work with the iPod. I narrowed it down to the wire and connector. If I used the old iPod cable with the wall charger it did charge the iPod, if I used the cable that came with the charging set the iPod indicated that there was a connection but it wouldn't charge the unit. Replacing the cable with the original iPod cable caused the iPod to charge. The car charger also would work but only with the original Apple cable.Since I ordered this to try to replace the Apple cable I have to give it 1 star since the supplied cable didn't work.I have to mention that I didn't have the size issue that others have had, the cable did fit the iPod without any excess force or adjustment to the plug."
5,Also excellent,"I am very pleased with the chargers that I received - I can charge my iPod almost wherever I am, and it is so convenient."
1,Quality is as cheap as its price,"I had a feeling that this would be a cheaply made throw away charger set, but it was so cheap that I was willing to take a chance. I was right. This piece of junk belongs in China only. I am even afraid to use it because I am afraid it might damage my IPOD/IPad.Deepak"
1,Too cheap to be true.,I ordered this product because it said that it was a universal charger. I have an Apple ipod 160GB but the chargers that I bought don't charge the battery. I suppose the price of the chargers are too good to be true.
1,Really Scared,"I just read all the reviews and Im shaking in my boots. From what I can tell, the good reviews must come from employees that work at the company. There are alot of negatives and not many positives. I have not recieved mine yet so Im - like really paranoid. I ran into this same sort of a problem with another vendor and nothing got resolved. No return and defective merchandise. Amazon should discontiue rep these typoe of accounts."
5,Nice extras,I thought these were a great idea to have around for extras. They were shipped right away in great condition.
4,works just fine,This item works just fine. It's definitely not the highest quality but for under a buck you can't go wrong.
5,On the road again!,Great for long trips or when I need to charge and I am not near my computer or don't want to turn the computer on.
2,meh,"the car charger makes my ipod buzz when i have it attached to an auxillary cord, however it was only 2 bucks so i cant complain too much. feel really cheap, but it charges it fine."
3,Seems pretty good.,More little accessories to lose or break. Lots of little pieces made of plastic. Hope it holds up over time. Seems OK so far.
4,Curious,"Im just curious,does this work for the apple iPod touch 1st genration, because im not planing on buying something that doesnt work so if somone can please reply, i would appreciate it."
3,Product as expected,Product arrived second time as expected. The first time they sent me someone elses product.
4,Waiting for hotsync cable,The hotsync cable did not work. I got in touch with the seller. They immediately promised to send me a new one. Let's wait and see.
3,Charger for Ipod,"I got his charger for my Ipod and it's very useful!It has two plugs one for the car and a regular one that you could use anywhere.The only thing i didn't like is the extension,if you lose it the two chargers will be useless."
2,Decent....,"I got two home outlet chargers instead of a car cigarette lighter charger. Not worth sending back, but a bit of a pain in the ass."
3,Get what you pay for,"All of the items arrived as described. The quality seems a little poor, but what can you expect for the price? Overall I'd say that I am happy with the purchase."
2,Too Costly,Although the product is not costly but adding shipping charges makes it costlier than others. I cancelled my purchase because of this readon. You may end up not using this charger at all if you have a laptop
3,What you would expect for the price,The product was as described. It isn't a high quality cable like you would expect from Apple but it doesn't cost much anyway.
3,Great Product for the price,"The price and functionality of this product are great. The quality is not something you would bet from Apple, but the price isn't either. Seems to work just fine."
3,Ipod Power Adapter Accessories,If you own an Ipod you know the problems of finding a USB port to recharge.I found it comforting to recharge at the airport boarding terminal just before a flight.The AC adapter is a bit bulky when you have multiple plugs on a AC adapter.All in all a good investment.
1,NOT FOR iPOD TOUCH!,"Warning! This product is advertised as universal, but when I attempted to charge my ipod touch, I receive the message that charging with this device is not supported by the ipod. Too bad I already threw the packaging away, what a waste of money."
5,Good Value for money,"I got this travel kit instead of the 30 bucks Apple charger. Its worth the money. The USB cable is a bit short, but you can buy a longer one from any store."
1,DO NOT EVEN PLUG THIS IN!,"I bought this to use in our car with our various mp3 players. Had problems with it the 1st time - actually thought the mp3 player was broken, so it was pulled out after a few seconds. Mp3 player WAS broken - we finally figured out how after we used it the second time and it BLEW UP IN OUR CAR and RUINED ANOTHER mp3 player. This thing is DANGEROUS and malicious and now we are out 2 very expensive mp3 players not to mention this cheap piece of garbage. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Doesn't work/shorted out,I bought 2 sets of this product. One didn't work as soon as I recieved it. The second set shorted out after the first charge. None of the 6 total items work. I knew the price was too good to be true. Lesson learned.
1,DO NOT BUY! LOOK ELSE WHERE,"Just as I suspected, you get what you pay for... None of the items work on my new iPod-Touch (june2010)!!! besides everything says 5V, whereas the amazon description says 12V, maybe that's why it did not work. DO NOT BUY! LOOK ELSE WHERE, I wish I could give it zero stars...."
1,Beware: you get what you pay for,"On paper (i.e., computer screen) it looks like an unbeatable deal. In person, though, it looks and feels cheap, and performs accordingly.I used both chargers with the retractable dock cord on several trips. They worked fine for about 3 months, then the car charger died.When I called BargainCell for a replacement, they told me I'm out of luck. The items are only guaranteed by BargainCell for 30 days, and they can't even refer me to the manufacturer because the product ""comes from China and there is no warranty.""Luckily I'm only out a few bucks because this package is so cheap. But I now have the hassle of researching and buying a replacement. Don't make the same mistake I made!One thing nice to say: I love the retractable USB dock cord, as it eliminates cable clutter in my car's glove compartment."
1,Dangerous,"Everything seemed poorly constructed when I got the set in the mail. Then things started falling apart. The car adapter comes apart everytime you try to unplug it. Every time! So I stopped using it so that I don't get the parts stuck in the cigarette lighter plug. The home charger was fine at first, but it too fell apart. One of the prongs came out in an outlet! it is so dangerous. I almost got shocked."
4,You get what you pay for,"I only purchased the retractable cord for about a buck on amazon. After about a year the retractable mechanism broke. Not a big deal considering how cheap it is which is why I'm back here buying another one. It's not the best made product but considering how cheap it is, it's not really a problem to just buy another. I suggest you buy two."
4,universal apple kit,"Good little product, it satisfied my needs. Overall the construction of the product could be better, sturdier, but serves ok for travel and it is compact."
3,Bang for your buck but not spectacular,Loose connection to socket. Convenient and easy to use. worth the couple bucks over others.
1,:(,I Was all excited that it was only 36 cents but then when I got it it only charged for about 30 seconds in the car and then it just stopped charging!
1,BEWARE! THIS MAY DESTROY YOUR iPOD!,"This recharger bent the innards of my poor iPod and it wouldn't charge or sync with my Mac anymore. According to the service people at the Apple Store it wasn't a good fit with the iPod's port, it bent a wire out of shape inside, and ruined my iPod. Buy the Apple recharger instead."
1,had to get a new board after use,"i just hd to get a new board for my ipod 40GB 3rd generation - the ipod doc i took it too was absolutely sure that this charger had caused the board to freeze. unfortunately another example that if you want to save money, it's sometimes better to spend more. so if you need a new charger, the only safe way to go is to buy the original apple power adapter - which unfortunately costs 8 times as much..."
1,DESTROYED my iPod,"I purchased this charger about 2 months ago, and was just using it for usb & car charger connections. those two worked fine, although the car charger did get a little warm after a while. I plugged it into the wall charger a few days ago & within 5 minutes my iPod was MELTED. (not ""melted"" as in doesn't work, but melted as in: it's barely recognizable) it was so hot both at the wall plug & the iPod that I burned my fingers trying to unplug it. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I filed a complaint with Amazon & all the seller did was give me $5, essentially their reaction to having destroyed a $200 mp3 player was ""sucks to be you"". I repeat. DO NOT BUY THIS. it's definitely worth the extra money to buy from Apple because they will at least take responsibility if their products are faulty."
2,Question before you buy,I had this charger kit for my 3g ipod and purchased one for my wife when I bought her 4th gen. ipod. It didn't work. The seller told me it doesn't work with the 4th gen.I believe the seller should make this know in his adv.
2,Buy Something Else!,"I was looking for a new charger set for my iPhone. This set simply did not work.-The 12v vehicle adapter was loose and came unplugged very easily-The fuse ended up shorting out, sparking and catching on fire in my vehicle, melting the 12v adapter-The AC plug/wall adpater would not continue charging once the phone entered sleep modeBuy a better quality unit, do not waste your money"
2,Ehh..,"This charger gets the job done for awhile, but it isn't made well. You can tell that it is very cheap. Breaks very quickly."
2,"Item cheaply made, but does perform.","Item is rather cheaply made and flimsy, but it does the job that is expected of it nonetheless."
2,Extremely Poorly Made,"This product is poorly made. It does charge my iPod, but the retractable cord only worked once (my friend's worked three times). The parts are shoddy. The pin on the end of the car charger came bent at an angle, the little tab that tells you how to retract the cord was falling off, and it was altogether of very poor quality. My friend ordered the same product and had the same problems. I give it two stars only because the wall charger does work."
1,Car charger also does not work,"Wall charger works fine, but I also could not get the car charger to work. Not worth the trouble to return it."
3,IT was FREE,"Ok so I ordered this and it was really cheap like 3$ but where I ordered it from had a warehouse fire so I didnt get it for 2 months but when I did get it they had already refunded me my money and set me 2 sets of ipod chargers for free. If it wasnt for the free part I would have been a little disappointed even at that cheap of a price. They are very fragile made out of very cheap non-durable plastic. if you are going to barely use this and leave it setting and not touch it very much then go ahead get this, but if your like me and want to throw this in your purse or something forget about it!!"
1,crappy,This stuff is crappy. It started smelling like it is burning after 2 minutes i started using it ...i threw it away ..a waste of hard earned money
3,Cord will not work if you use an Otterbox,"While it works, if you use an Otterbox, it doesn't work; you would have to take your I-Phone out of the Otterbox in order to make the cord connect. Had to buy another cord so I don't have to disassemble my Otterbox each day."
1,Save your money.,"Very cheaply made. Seems to work okay, although wire is small and flimsy. Would not recommend for use by children."
4,Great product,Very practical. Just what I needed. Delivery was quick and couldn't beat the price! Will be very convenient to carry with me everywhere so that I am never without the ability to charge my Ipod.
1,Trash,This product is a cheap trash from china. i lost my money.the moment i connect to my ipod is broken immediatelynever had a chance to test it out.Very very bad.
2,Awful AC to DC conversion - barely works,"This was exciting. The retractable cord albeit a little short to hit your nightstand from most wall outlet locations in hotels has a great retracting spring to help you wrap things up quickly. However, the AC adapter i received must be faulty. I plugged in overnight, and while it showed :Charging"" it didnt actually charge. I tried in 2 hotels and 3 airports, all the same. I kept it anyways simply because i liked the retractable USB dongle and I used an apple charger with it, but overall it just didnt work for me.Cable, while cheap and i doubt it would last daily use, works for now.AC adapter, nope.DC adapter. Psh, who needs this? Thrown in for the sake of having it. Very few do not have an ipod adapter in car already, and if youre buying this to be used in car, dont. thin cables just arent good for being repeatedly pinched and abused in a car enviroment"
2,USB Retractable Hotsync Cable,this was a very helpful kit but the USB Retractable Hotsync Cable broke the 1st time i used it and made my ipod flash on and off rapidly.
4,this one works,"I wrote a review that this charger DIDN'T work, and the first one didn't. The retractable cord is a great idea though. They sent me a second one, and it at least works with my ipod nano. On the iTouch, it NOW states this charger is not for use on this device. The product photo shows it charging an iPhone/iPod touch. I don't understand. I do appreciate the vendor contacting me and sending me a charger that ""works"". In the future I'll be more discerning when buying a product like this."
1,I am clueless,"This might be the best little gizmo ever created, but it arrived with no instructions for how to put it together or use it. I'm usually pretty good with technical stuff, but this thing leaves me scratching my head!"
2,Buy just for a cord replacement,The wall plug and car plug didn't work. I have an i pod nano they might work with other models. It had a big discounted price like for 4 dollars and just needed a new cord to replace my damaged one. The work is nice and works well. I was not expecting the car plug to work but was expecting the wall one too. I feel it is still worth it just to have another cord for the computer but do not get if you are expecting the other stuff to work.
3,Product works as described,"I ordered this product and it took ever for it to arrive from the importer (seller). I have used it only to charge my ipod touch 4G, never used it for sync. It works fine."
5,It's a STEAL!,"Bought this to go along with my new iPod Classic 120, and it works GREAT. It's a no brainer, and at this price it's a STEAL, too!"
4,Works well,"I purchased this product for another person. So far it has worked well for them and all parts continue to work. They don't look like they would stand up to much abuse and wear and tear, but they are a good value for the price offered. Given that you will take care of them they should last a reasonable amount of time."
3,Ok,"I don't recall when I ordered this, but, here goes.I loved it for a couple of months.After the couple of months, the prongs popped out into the electrical outlet. (very unsafe)"
3,It serves the purpose,"It's worth it, I like the portability and the interchangeability of it. You can't have the player plugged in to charge while having an adapter to play it in the car, but it's still worth the very low price I paid for it."
1,NOT for iPOD Touch 3G,"It is a grab bag. It all depends on what you get - uhh... no, it all depends on what they feel like to ship out. I ordered one in Nov. 2009 for my son's iPod Touch 3G and it worked fine (still works - knocking on woods). A few days ago, I ordered another exactly SAME one for my daughter and IT DOES NOT WORK. Upon closer look, one from last year is labeled as ""Travel Charger"" but the one received this week says ""Travel Charger For iPhone 3G"". Both chargers look exactly same! Go figure.If anybody needs an extra iPod charger, go ahead and order one. Who knows? You may get lucky. It is a 50/50 chance so I would say it is a fair game!!Now the BIG question is whether I should buy myself an iPhone in order not to waste this beautiful thing?"
3,only received 2 of the advertised products but they work,"The two product that I received work well. I'm not sure what happened to the retractable hotsync cable but figured it wasn't worth the hassle since both the cigarette and home charger work well. If you really want all three, make sure you get them :) I also use these two products to charge my cell phone using my USB cable."
5,changed my life!,"this charger changed my life, now I can charge my iItems without fear!thank youplus, acts as an effective badger repellent!what a bonus!!!!!"
1,charger review.,"right before i got this, i bought a 400$ white 4g iphone. I wanted to get a good charger for it. 4$ seemed like a good deal at the time. When i got the box with it it looked perfectly normal. First i tried the wall charger. In the first 3 seconds i put my iphone in to charge the charger practly blew up the charger and messed up my iphone so i had to pay anouther 100$ to get my iphone fixed. Next i tried the car charger. Same thing happend but worse. In the first 3 seconds smoke came out of the charger my iphone went black and the cigarette liter singed so it was broken for good. And when i went to the appstore they said it was broke for good!!!!!"
3,"Five months in, it still works, but not as well","I got this, as I suppose most people do, to avoid having loose cords flopping around my car's interior. To that extent, it works very well. A little tug on the cord and it retracts in on itself, saving space. After five months of regular use, this feature works the same as the day it arrived. What has suffered, however, is the connection between the charger and my iphone. Upon arrival, this worked fine and and I did not even get those annoying ""device not designed"" to work with iphone notices. But five months on, the connection is not clean. I often have to jiggle the connection to get the charger connect. This is a minor annoyance, so far, and once jiggled the connection usually stays.That being said, the price is certainly right."
2,Not for Nano,"I own a Nano. I keep this charger in my car for emergency purposes. If I were on the road and the battery died, I could plug it in. However, I can NOT plug it in to the Nano at the same time that the headphone jack is attached. So, if you need to charge the Nano, you'll have to do so at the expense of listening to music. Standard cigarette lighters also don't work when the car is not on, so it's not like you can leave it charging in your car when you get out either.On a side note, I recently traveled cross country and drove 750 miles a day while listening to my Nano; the battery never died. So, there would rarely ever be an instance that I could see using this product, aside from my own negligence in forgetting to charge the Nano when I had a chance."
4,Two out of Three ain't bad,"Everything, the retractable connector and both of the chargers are exactly as depicted. The only problem was that the iPod connector was too wide to allow a headphone to be plugged into the iPod nano headphone jack, not even the very thin connector with the iPod earbuds."
1,Horrible,"I bought this product originally for a new cord, eventually i used the wall charger since my other I had lost over at a friends house. When I used the wall charger, I heard a hiss then a pop. Before I could pull my ipod off, it was dead. The dammed wall charger that I never used had fried my Ipod touch. I called the company and I kept getting voice mail. If you cherish your ipod and other electronics, do not buy this item."
1,Cheap and doesn't work,"As other reviewers have said: you get what you pay for. The cord seems slightly more sturdy than the plug and car plug, but all of them have the quality of stuff from the dollar store. Both plugs are made of flimsy plastic in China. All of the parts are incredibly cheaply made: lightweight, the joints don't really match up, and in my experience it stopped working soon after purchase. I used the cord to sync my iPod a few times, until suddenly my computer could no longer read my iPod (luckily, using the original Apple cord worked)."
1,Unsatisfied,"I have this charger hooked up in my car, for use with my i-pod nano. I have charger of a different make that I use in my home. The charger is the same type of retractable plug in usb variety. The problem with this specific charger is that it takes a lot of wiggeling, pluging and unplugging to get it to charge. Be it the ciggarette jack plug or the cable that feeds to the ipod nano; the product i recieved does not work. The ciggarette lighter jack also somewhat falls apart and has to be pressed back together every so often."
4,Great product and cheap,It is a product that actually works may look cheap but trust me it works. I was looking for a ipod charger because mine had broken and I went to Wal Mart and they cost $20. So I purchased one from here and it was way cheaper. Its your choice. Some people would pay $20 and some would rather pay $0.01 plus shipping and handling which is about $4. Not only has the wall charger but also the car charger which is a win win.
4,"Good stuff, not great packaging","It's a good product but the design seems a bit weak. I'm being careful with the stuff because I'm afraid it might break.But to me it wasn't all that much money, so if it breaks my life won't end."
2,Made too cheap,Most of the parts work. The lighter charger for the car was already in pieces when it came out of the box. This product will get an OK rating as long as it's free. Very 'cheap' product.
2,Not so good,"The car charger doesn't actually charge my iPod. The simbol is show on the batter recognizing that it is being charged, but no matter how long you leave it pluged in it still has the same amount of battery life on it as when I plugged it in."
1,"I really wanted to like this product, as I wanted to use it...","Upon first use the product literally fell into a million pieces. The case opened up, the metal tip broke, and everything else snapped. I wasn't applying unnecessary force or anything, it literally just fell apart. I'm sure it would've worked well if it didn't beak into a hundred pieces."
3,Good price. Quality OK.,"Had it for almost 2 years and it still works! However it looks really cheap, so I paid extra attention in order not to risk breaking them."
1,does not even work,"i received this product 3 weeks later and i thought it wasn't even going to come. when i do receive it, they sent me two of the identical products. i plug the wall charger in and plug it into my ipod but it doesn't even charge. how can they sell a product that doesn't even work? and i sent them a email and it's been over a week with no reply. don't buy their products or you'll be wasting time including money."
2,Didn't work,"I ordered this product because I needed the wall plug urgently. When the product finally arrived, after some time, the other two portions worked perfectly, however, the wall plug did not! Ugh!! When I plugged my phone up to it it sounded like I was plugging and unplugging it quickly and repeatedly. Needless to say I unplugged it, and went to a local store a bought another one."
1,Junk,Within 30 seconds of plugging it into the wall it started melting. I mean the plastic around the charger started bubbling. Luckaly it didnt fry my ipod
1,Not Worth your Money.. Just piece of Junk,"Just opened the package and pulled the USB Retractable Hotsync Cable to charge my iphone and guess what.. the retractable part broke. Somehow managed to put it for charge. The first time it worked fine. the next day, it stopped working. Did not test the Car charger, but am not expecting it to be any different than the other 2. Also all the 3 compenents look very fragile.Don't buy this."
3,OK so far.,Have had this product for only a month. The plug is needlessly large (why can't the prongs fold?). I have not yet used the car lighter charger. The price was right.January 2013 - still plugging along. Everything still works fine. I still gripe about the design of the plug.
2,Worked fine the first few days for my iPhone 3G,"The first few days, the cigarette charger (my primary purpose for buying this) was working perfectly. After a week, my iPhone 3G wasn't charging anymore. The red light on the cigarette adapter was lit, indicating power was coming in, but my iPhone was not charging. I'm giving it 2 stars since I did get a cool retractable usb cord, which by the way, doesn't stay in the lock position. The locking mechanism worked for a couple days before it went out. Only thing left that I have to check on is the wall adapter. Last week it was working, but who knows...I don't really need it anyway."
4,Good for a car charger,"This works fine in my wife's car, not so well in mine. It was a good buy, so she can keep her phone charged."
5,Nice set,"This set gives you everything you may need to plug your Ipod and get the best out of it, either sound or video. This company's service is really good and the items got home on time and mint conditions"
1,I Don't Recommend This Product,"The Car & Home Charger Seam To Work ,The Sync Cable On The Original Order Worked Once,I Got A Replacement For Free But Same Problem I Used It One Time & It Wouldn't Work After That.???????For The $3.00 I Suppose I Shouldn't Expect To Much , Chargers Are Worth That Much.But I Wouldn't Recommend This Product.Pay The Extra Money & Buy A Good One!Not Worth The Aggravation!!!!!"
5,Works anywhere!,"I used the wall charger for the wall socket in India and it still works despite different electricity voltage rating in India!(Its 240V in India, but 100V in US). Great value for money!"
1,iPod car/home charger,A piece of garbage. Don't waste your money. I was fooled and lured by the price and the entire package so I got what I paid for...garbage. Nothing works! I would give it zero star if it was an option. So disappointing. And it's not even worth it to return it because the cost of shipping was already 200% more than the cost of the product! So don't waste your money. Better invest in something real.
1,The cable does not fit my Ipod,"When i opened the box i realized that it was wrong, cables are all black, and they does not fit my ipod, the Hotsync Cable was sopoused to be retractable and it is not. I hope they send me a wrong order."
2,unsafe,"Here I am reviewing this product for you guys and Closet Exchange. This I got this item damaged, only the USB cord works so if you want an iPod computer charger and NOT a wall charger, I suggest you buy this item. I was looking for a wall charger and was disappointed when I figured the stuff was broken, probably because of the packaging.Don't buy this item, it's quite horrible."
5,Great Value,"I can now charge my iPod anywhere without a computer, which is exactly what I needed.Very simple and very inexpensive. Only rarely is there a problem with communication, but I see that as often whenattaching to a Mac! Just unplug and start again.Car charger is a little long, so it sticks up more than I'd want, but the retractable cord is cool."
1,charging Ipod cable,"The kit is cheap and I go twhat I paid for. The cable charges but thats it, it does not transre and info from your computer to your Ipod. very frustrating. It does charge you Ipod and thats it."
5,Works well,"I was a bit skeptical about ordering this whole kit as it was cheap. When i got the set it does indeed look cheap but it does work, the charger for the car is fine and the wall outlet plug works flawlessly so far. I do have an apple car charger that I used on my old 2nd gen i-pod and although it charges that fine it does not charge my 5th gen Nano....hmmm. Luckily this set does."
3,"Great price,","I bought this because of the great price and free shipping, but the wall charger broke after one day."
4,iPod accessories.,Products arrived on the date posted which by itself still amazes me! They are easy to use and to store in my truck's console.(iPod is connected directly to stereo system). Recommend these items to anyone.
1,Refund?!,"Ok, so I saw all the good reviews on this.Came here and I was soooo pumped.Turns out the wall charger doesn't work...AT ALL.I plugged my iPod in for the night, work up,and it was still not charged.Ugh, how frustrating.Can you say refund?The only thing I really really like is theUSB retractable cable. Otherwise, this productis a no no no no noand did I mention it all came in different boxes?!so I probably got one that was one of many returns.FANTASTIC!"
1,Ipod chargers,"These were junk. The AC cord prong broke off in the outlet, rendering it useless - on the first day I used it. The car IPOD charger does not work. I ended up buying one at Best Buy. I would not purchase this again from this source."
2,Price is right for the quality,"Chargers work fine, retractable cable broke on first use - poor design cheap plastic. Not worth the return shipping cost."
5,iPod charger kit,"The item arrived just a few days after I ordered it, was in excellent condition, and worked as advertised."
2,Disapointing,This is a very cheap product. One of my wall charger's plug actually came off and was stuck in my wall outlet. I had to turn of the main electricity to remove it! I am not satisfied with this product. I rated this a 2 star product because the cable and the car charger are very useful.
4,Not measuring up,"This product at first seems awesome. it has a retractable cord which makes it easy to carry around, it comes with a car adaptter and a wall outlet. However I have ordered this product twice before, because the USB cable itself broke. Over time, the coating on the cord begins to separate from either end. And once the coating has seperated, the actual wires begin to break. And then when you connect your ipod, no charge. So as much of a deal you might get with this product, the cord itself will break in about 6 months or less.The wall adapter...a piece broke off after my second time plugging it into the wall.No complaints for the car adapter. Best bar is, since its a USB car adapter I can plug my other USB electronics into it."
4,Working as expected.. worth it for price,Working as expected. Charging is slow compare to Original Iphone charger and takes some more time. But who cares if its so low price..!!
4,Handy Charger Kit,"Works in the car, useful for the office. Love the accordion cord, it makes it easier to carry the cord in my bag for on the road use."
1,Disappointed,I love having a car charger for the IPOD Nano but it didn't work. The plug-in unit works but when we took a long road trip it was disappointing to not have the car charger work.
4,Exactly what i expected and GREAT DEAL,"Product was exactly what i expected and was a GREAT DEAL! However, minus the stars because it clashes with my FM transmitter, if i ever want to charge and listen to my ipod in the car. It causes loud static which kills the quality of the music. So i can't charge and listen to my music in the car. Otherwise, GREAT DEAL!"
1,Ipod,Bought it for my 4th gen ipod nano and didnt work. Only reason I didn't return it cause it worked for my shuffle.
1,Did not work at all!,"This product was fairly inexpensive so I purchased it as a charger for my ipod in my new car. When I recieved the product it did not work...I plugged it in and the little red light flickered for a while and was not charging my ipod at all. They sent me a defective product. When I wrote to them to see if I could get my money back they told me to send the product back to them and they would refund me the money. The only problem is that I already had to pay to ship it to myself and then they wanted me to pay to ship it back. The combined shipping cost was more than the cost of the product itself. In the end I will never purchase something from this company again, it was a complete waste of my money and I will be aware of inexpensive products advertised on this website."
4,Works but don't buy for nano,"It works great, it's just you can't plug in an audio cable while this charger is plugged in to a nano. The charging connecter and headphone connecter are so close together on the nano that you will have to use only official apple stuff (as far as i know) so that using one won't block the use of the other.I cant listen to music in my car while I'm charging with this adapter. It's Apples fault for bieng overly proprietary, but buy informed."
2,it froze my iPod,The connector does not work for thrid generation nano. It caused the hard drive to freeze-up. I had to take it back to the store and they re-booted. I'm not using the charger.
4,worked fine so far,"It seems to be made of cheap materials, but it works and for the price i didn't expect much more. Would buy again."
1,The worst product for Ipod,After recharging for second time it didn`t work in my Ipod and I had to buy the original accesories. Please stop selling this product. I want a refund from this purchase.
1,Cheaply made defective product,"This is a defective product! I soon as I plugged it into my car, the tip broke!Do NOT buy this product."
4,Excellenct concept!,"All chargers should be designed to be so versitile~ The theory behind this is brilliant... Hint to cell phone companies... My car charger never worked and the product is cheaply constructed, I gave it 4 stars though becasue the retractable cord is great! I use it at my desk at work for ""emergency"" use and my whole crew uses it! If there was something like this with solid construction I would have one for every device i own. (GPS, iPod, Cell phone, PDA, sirius radio. blah blah blah...my car is over run with cables and charger cords.)"
4,One flaw keeps me from recommending this item,"The main flaw is that the AC adapter fits very loosely in the surge protecter, so sometimes when you think you are charging your iPod, the adapter has slipped out, and there was no charge at all. Very frustrating."
1,Both wall charger and iPod connection cable didn't work,"My initial impression of this package was CHEAP, the package that it came in was even taped shut with scotch tape. I opened it and plugged the wall charger into the wall and plugged my iPod into it to charge it and, no surprise here it didn't. I tried a few combination's with the devices to test if they worked,...1 I tried plugging my PS3 remote to charge it, it didn't work2 I tried plugging it into a different outlet3 I tried the extension cable in my computer to charge the iPod, and found the retractable cable didn't work eitherMy initial thought was that one of the devices didn't work, but it came as a surprise to me that two of the devices that came in this package didn't work properly. Needless to say I didn't even try the Car charger, I packed them back up and sent them back the next day."
2,Hit or miss. Don't use the car charger plug.,"A word of caution, this is a low priced item because corners have been cut and the quality control isn't very good.I've purchased 5 or 6 of these items now and for the most part everything has been fine. I've never had an issue with the USB cord or the wall adapter but I've had a few problems with the car charger. A couple of the sets have refused to charge my phone. Which isn't to bad for something this cheap but recently we had something a little more concerning happen. I gave a set to my mother-in-law to use for her car. Before she realized what it was she had fried the fuses in two separate cars when trying to use the charger.So if you want a cheap USB cord and wall charger then this is a decent cheap set. Don't buy this for the car charger, its not worth damaging you car or device to save a couple bucks."
1,Doesn't charge my iPhone - Junk,Update: the lighter adapter died after 1 week of use.Was looking for a cheap charger for my 4S. In part of the description it says iPhone but in the main description it says iPod so it's a little confusing in the description as to what will charge. The retractable cable doesn't charge my phone. I really was just looking for a lighter adapter so it kinda did what I wanted it to do. I tossed the junk cable in the trash and used the lighter & wall charger w/ a different cable. It wasn't worth the hassle of sending it back. Keep in mind you get what you pay for so don't expect much with this.
5,IPOD charging kit,"This pretty much had everything you need for your iPod, especially if you got it secondhand, like I did, without cables. Now I can use it all the time! Chargers work perfectly and the retractable cable is much better for travel than the original one."
2,At least it works... kind of.,"This product was very cheap, and yes, you pay for exactly what you get. The cigarette lighter attachment works sometimes. You have to move it around a lot in the outlet to get it to start charging. The outlet adapter is pretty much the same, it works sometimes. This could be because of the piece that fits into you apple product. I had an iPhone 3G and it fit VERY tightly; I was almost afraid to plug it in. Then sometimes it wouldn't work. It does not work at all on my new iPhone 4. The phone says it does not support it... weird. I would probably not buy it again... because it does not work with my new phone. The end."
3,Homework junkie,"This overall has been a good purchase for a very good price. It works and has served me well actually. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because the quality isn't the best. It didn't break, it's just not the best quality..."
5,Works,Bought this for my daughter in South Africa. She was happy with it. So what else can I say? It Works!
4,Recommended,"This book was heartwarming and the main character, if sometimes annoying with her ""heartless"" behavior, is likable. Besides Noreen though, the author has interesting, 3D suporting characters: Wesley Cuthand, Noreen's boyfriend, and the many inhabitants of the town Noreen stumbles upon at the beginning of the book.Very much like Where The Heart Is, this book is about a stranger who walks into town one day, and changes the lives of the people who live there."
3,True Confessions of a Heartless Girl,"Everybody has secrets and obstacles they have to cross. Pembina Lake just seems to attract people with hidden pasts that seem unreal to the people around them. Noreen is a troubled young woman who runs away from her apartment where she lived with her boyfriend Wesley. She ends up in a small café there owned by Lynda, a widower with a son named Del. Throughout the story Noreen has to deal with countless hard times, such as a family who was never there for her, becoming pregnant and losing her child, and ruining the restaurant. I would indeed recommend this book. It toys with your emotions and has a very good plot. At times it can be confusing however. It would be better if things were more clear and drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone between the ages of 13 to 17 due to a more mature writing style and the context of the novel. Read as you discover the exciting rise and fall of Noreen."
1,Nice faucet for the money-FOR A WHILE,"Once I got the old faucet removed, which had corroded shanks (even though the old nuts were plastic), this was easy to install. Hopefully, this faucet being all plastic, it will not corrode and will be very easy to remove when the time comes. It operates very much like a certain name brand faucet. It will probably not be possible to obtain repair parts for this faucet when it needs repair. However, the cost of the faucet is not currently much more than some faucets' repair kits. I am glad I purchased this faucet. It does come with a plastic pop-up assembly, which can cost $7 at some close-out stores. The visible parts of the pop-up are chrome plated.UPDATE 1/10/2012 - The cold water side has started leaking and will not cut all the way off. Sometimes it is a steady stream, sometimes a quick drip. I would not recommend this faucet. I cut the rating from 5 stars to 1."
3,Not cheap enough,"I was looking for the cheapest piece of crap I could find to replace the faucet in my apartment and came across this. The entire thing is plastic, it even comes with a plastic sink popup assembly (I've never seen one before) that I didn't need. It moves slightly when you turn it on/off and you can really feel that it's plastic. When I first started using it the handle was really stiff but after moving it around a bit I heard this pop and suddenly it was much smoother and had a wider range. Overall it doesn't look bad for what it is and it gets the job done. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the price, I think the popup assembly should be removed and this should be sold for around $10-15."
3,Funky dynamics,"Perhaps its just the nature of the work itself, but I can't listen to this whole CD without adjusting the volume during play. If I put it at a point where the loud passages are at an acceptable level, I can't hear the soft parts. If I crank it up so I can decifer the soft passages, I have to cover my ears during the loud stuff. Not friendly for use in a 5-CD changer....."
5,New World Symphony,A great performance of Dvorak's 9th (New World) Symphony. The last movement always gives me goosebumps (in a good way)!
2,Dvorak brutalized,"This is, above all, Dvorak brutalized. The famed Chicago brass section really blares out here while the strings slash at every bar just as a woodcutter would with an axe when splitting firewood. Am I the only one that longs for a certain amount of subtlty in this not so subtle music? The high impact sound recorded in the early digital era is impressive but the massed strings sound a bit glaring in the upper register. Anyone looking for an accont of this symphony in a similrly exciting vain is advised to go for the Bernstein/NYP (Sony), which I think is far more successful than this one and indeed one of the best on the market."
2,Harsh String sound,"A lovely interpretation, but the strings from this early digital recording are harsh. The CD is very difficult to listen to. I gave my copy to charity."
4,Thrilling but flawed,"Solti's trademark driving intensity is very much in evidence on this recording. The huge dynamic range makes the climaxes in the first, third and final movements absolutely hair-raising with powerful brass playing throughout. However, the second movement is a low point as the woodwinds are glaringly out of tune with the rest of the orchestra. It's rather amazing that this flub was not noticed by Solti. On the whole, this is a good performance that revels in the sheer power of this music, while perhaps glossing over some of its subtlety."
1,Got it by mistake and thought it was a lousy pic,"Got it by mistakeI wouldn't normally look for pics like this, and nine more words.for this stupid rating system"
4,Really Cool - well worth the wait!,"I really like the format it's in. All of the pages are laminated (to avoid those cooking accidents) and there are cute Scottish anecdotes and pictures throughout. It has recipes for every occassion, including drinks!"
3,stainless not stainless?,"Initial quality good, but after storing in a damp place -- they rusted. Not so great when the rust is in between each of those tinee tiny fade notches..."
2,Save your money and buy a kong and stuff it with goodies,If your dog likes to chew or is pretty hard on the toys this is not the toy you want to get. Within 5 minutes my dog had the ends off this toy. Get a kong and stuff it with treats and peanut butter and freeze it. Dogs loves it and its lasts hours
2,designed for a very tiny dog,"Just received this item & I was shocked at how tiny it was. The size should be described as mini. In fact, they should state the dimensions in the product description. The small size is 3 1/2"" long & the ""gnawhides"" are 1/8"" thick, 1"" wide. Have a 14 week old Cairn (weighs 6 lbs.) that is a very active chewer & he'd probably try to swallow this thing whole. It would take him longer to chew his dog food than it would one of the rawhide rings. I know dog toys aren't cheap (if you're buying them all the time) but the price for this size bone ($7.73) is ridiculous to me. Especially when you add to that the cost of the refills. This toy would have been great for my Pom when she was a baby: she weighed 2 lbs. at 3 months. But for a ""small"" dog? Guess my idea of small is way different. Rated this item 2 stars only because it arrived quickly."
2,Doesn't last long,I bought this for my Miniature Pinscher and she really loved it. She didn't lose interest in it but she ended up eating the bones on either side of the toy before finishing the treats. She only weighs 9 pounds so if anything this could be used for a Chihuahua. My dog never chews up any of her toys so this one wasn't very good. We used it for about a week before throwing it away.
3,Good toy; edible pi`eces useless,"My dog loves the toy itself, but the edible pieces are gone in about 20 seconds (quite literally). I'll hold onto the toy, but won't be buying any replacementrings."
2,Some concern....,"As an owner of 2 Doxie ""toyminators"" I was looking for a ""chew toy"" that would actually help them. This product was recommended but I have to warn you. Even without a treat attached, like mine, the boy chewed to the point that the stem cracked and the whole ""bone edge"" was in his mouth. Thankfully I was there and he didn't try to swallow it:) I'm not sure there really is a non-destructable toy out there but if ANYONE has a recommendation I welcome it!!"
3,"Some love, some leave it!","My Boxers don't seem very interested in this toy, as they like toys that make sqeaks and other noises. My daughter's Emglish Bulldogs, however, love this toy and really play with it, and she says it's quite durable. So, it depends on the dog whether this toy is a hit or a miss!"
5,"Please, Please, hurray up and open the package!","This review is much better than my previous review. I bought two of these for 2 of my larger dogs that are chewers and most toys will be chewed up within 10 minutes... I have had these for over a week, and are stillintact! Even my little dog will try to chew off the goodies at the end, so I give her the remnants of the goodie when adding a new ring. They could not wait for the package to be opened (could smell it while it was still in the shipping box) Package was hard to open (companies use just too much plastic) and I almost cut my fingers with the scissors. No need for this type of plastic on mail orders...No one will steal.Each bone came with extra treats, and each bones treat will last my dogs at least a day. They love these.Wish they had extra small for little dogs! Have spent a lot of money on toys for my super chewers, butthese really hold up and dogs love em! Great item!"
3,fun toy for toy dogs,My dog loved this toy. This toy should be given only to dogs who are not big chewers and not rough players. I would suggest this toy for toy and very small dogs only.
4,"Good for tough chewers, but not for lengthy entertainment","My dog is Shiba Inu/Mini Schnauzer mix. I'll tell you what, this dog CHEWS. Toys made for large-breed heavy chewing dogs do not stand a chance against this little guy. He also has the attention span of a doorknob, so he has many many toys which we rotate through to keep him entertained.This toy in particular has stood up rather well. There are tiny little dents on the ends but it's not falling apart. However, without the rawhide treats, my dog won't touch it. He doesn't even bring it to me to play fetch (granted, he prefers squeaky toys for fetch games.) The toy may be a little heavy for carrying around via puppy or small dog mouth.I would recommend this toy to dogs who like the treat-dispensing toys and are prone to heavy chewing, but the fun value is otherwise pretty low. It's good to leave out while at work to give the poor mutt something to work at, but it will not entertain any mammal for extended periods of time."
3,Not tough,"My miniature schnauzer loves this toy, but she has already made inroads on the ""bone"" ends. I hoped it would last longer."
3,Good concept but doesn't last long,I like the concept of this toy w/these rawhide strips but it didn't work as well as I'd like. The strips are thin and expensive and don't last long. The ends come off easy so my dogs chewed the part you screw in so it doesn't stay together well once the refill is put in.
3,Get the other one,"This one doesn't clean their teeth as well as the other one (premier bone with bristles is better). My pom didn't go after the bone at all,while my Akita went after the premier and it is his favorite. Get the Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone instead."
3,"Rawhide rings do not last long, heavy, but he loved it anyway.","My 30lb aussie mix ate the rings off in less than 5 minutes, but he enjoyed just chewing on the plastic bone ends by themselves. The toy lasted longer than most do for him, but his mouth is slightly too small for the ball, which is all that is left of it. This is a very heavy toy, not good for fetching."
3,meh,"The dogs haven't really touched it but that may be because we ordered the large. Not sure how well the little treat discs are either, neither dog seemed interested in them...wish I wouldn't have bought a package of replacements! 1-2 with Premier toys. Both dogs loved the Tug-a-Jug toy"
3,Was a great bone but...,"Length:: 2:38 MinsIt was a great bone for a while, until we bought our second refill pack... It was then that our 11 year old Yorkie, Allie, figured out how to unscrew it.Now she can unscrew this bone in less than 10 minutes.(Video is sped up x4)"
3,Overpriced & Easy to Disassemble,"I bought both the bristle bone and this one, the bouncey bone. When I bought them I thought the high price was easy to justify. A toy that satisfies a chewing urge, smells yummy, and keeps my dog entertained sounded like a great thing. The pieces unscrew so you can reload the rawhide rings. My medium sized dog found it very easy to take it apart, and I found the pieces scattered while he chewed on it under my desk. It happened so quickly that when I discovered it, he had already started to destroy one of the purple rubber rings on the bristle bone. I wanted to prevent the disassembly trick, so I screwed the pieces together more tightly. Unfortunately the weak nylon piece broke off when I did that. There's about $20 down the drain. Maybe I should have stuck to Nylabones."
2,Chi's ignore the toy,"My Chi puppies ignore this toy and the smooth rawhide that comes with it BUT they love the rough rawhide. I give them the rings and they go crazy tossing it, chewing it and chasing each other for it."
2,Definitely Not Hours of Entertainment,"This will definitely NOT entertain your dog for hours unless they are a slightly lacking in intelligence and can't figure out how to take the treat off! It takes my dogs a matter of seconds to rip off the treats! While they are moderately entertained by the toy itself, the purpose was to entertain them for a reasonable amount of time so I could work! I would recommend the Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone instead . . . it takes them significantly longer to get the treats out of this toy :-)"
2,So far no luck,So far my dog isn't interested in this toy at all. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do about that. Concept for the toy is great but I guess you've gotta have a dog that actually likes this to work. Maybe he'll show interest later. After all he is new to toys.
1,Complete Junk,"My Vizsla puppy was given this toy and had absolutely no interest in it. But that is not even why this Toy is junk.One afternoon in an attempt to get him to play with it, I tossed it towards him and the bone literally smashed into pieces. The only part salvaged from this toy was the rubber ball center. Which I now occasionally fill with peanut butter and he really love that. What a complete waste of money, it lasted one week. And he never even played with it."
4,Not A Surprise...,"My lab was SO excited to get a new toy....as many have said, he ate the treats on the ends in a matter of minutes. I must preface and say I LOVE nylabones, but these bone ends are not as durable and he has already begun to destroy both ends. This can't be a toy we leave with him without intensely watching.But, on a positive note: HE LOVES IT! It has provided plenty of fun!!For your purchasing decision it may help to know our lab is 70 lbs and we bought the Med/Lg and it seems like perfect fit."
5,More indestructible than most,"I have a yellow lab who can chew through almost anything. I had purchased smaller versions of this toy in the past, but he always chewed the ends to the point where they lasted only a couple weeks. This one he hasn't destroyed yet and he's had it for 3 weeks. It also takes him longer to get the rawhide discs chewed off. Best part yet- it's a great toy that doesn't squeak!"
4,Good Multi-Purpose Toy,"This is a fairly good toy. When you put the treats on, it keeps the Rottie busy for a while. It is not his favorite, however (he prefers the bones made by this same company). But, when you need an indestructible ball, just unscrew this was and toss it out back. He runs with the thing until he is tired. He can destroy anything. He has never been able to destroy one of this balls."
3,"Dog Loves It, For 5 Minutes","My energetic lab mix loves his Busy Buddy. Sometimes he gnaws on just the bone part for a little while, but he is ecstatic when the rawhide rings are added. It occupies him for about 5-7 minutes. Be wary of anything that says it entertains your dog for hours, because most likely it will entertain some dogs for just a couple minutes. Probably the smaller the puppy, the longer it lasts. But it's nothing for my T-Rex."
3,Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone,"My Westie can remove the chew treats in a matter of seonds - not much challenge there. However, he does really like the nylon bone more than other bones. Overall, this is not worth the money. I would recommend the ""Tug-A-Jug"" over this. I have a lab that loves the large one and my Westie uses the smaller size. I can get their entire meal into the jug. They do get quite rowdy trying to get their dinner out so you may want to use this outside or in the basement."
3,"Good concept, poor quality gnaw hide","Good concept in terms of a rubber toy with refillable ringed gnaw treats but the treats get ripped out FAST! too easy an access for the dogs. Mine ate the first two treats within an hour & the last few within the hours of my refilling it. If you want them to be amused for a while, better to get a Kong. If you just want a skeleton of a plastic bone for them to lose interest in, than this is your toy. It's too hard for him to wrap his mouth around as a gnawing toy so without the treats, its just no longer fun for him.Good quality plastic... but overall bad toy for the purpose its trying to fulfill (the purpose being to have the dog leave you alone for a while)"
3,Fun Fades Quickly,"Our 4 pound dachshund loved this toy at first, but as soon as the smell wears off the chews then she wants nothing to do with it. However it does seem well built, and is easy to use. Mostly just to expensive to keep loaded with chews if your dog only likes new smells or eats them quickly."
5,EXACTLY what I have been wanting for years!!!!!,"Somebody give this company an Oscar, an Emmy, or maybe the Nobel Peace Prize. (because peace in my house now). I have been wanting a dog chew forever that would:- not be gone in 60 seconds- not be a choking hazard- not be greasy and icky inside the houseThere has never been anything that fits the above for my large, chewing dogs. I would have never come up with this idea, but it works flawlessly. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! The dogs can even chew it in the bed and not make a mess.One little flaw.... The refills don't always fit, and have to be doctored. Hopefully I just got a bad batch. But they are so worth it, at any price. My dog has chewed on this for a whole half hour. I am one happy, HAPPY camper! I can't believe other viewers say their dogs get the rings off right away. Maybe they have the wrong size for their dog."
4,chewtastic,"I bought two of these for my beagles, the treats that you can add are okay but wernt really needed they just chew and chew and chew on the hard bone type part"
3,NOTHING GREAT HERE,"CAN'T KNOCK THE PRODUCT.BUT CAN KNOCK THE AD I FIRST SAW THIS PRODUCT ON. (See Family Handyman mag. Web site).THE PICTURE SHOWS SOME JERK PULLING A NAIL FROM THE POINTED END, THROUGH A PIECE OF FINE WOOD !!!DOES THIS IDIOT NOT REALIZE THAT THE HEAD OF THE NAIL IS GOING TO RUIN THE3 BOARD AS THIS TOOL PULLS IT THROUGH.WHY WORRY ABOUT THE WOOD BEING MARKED BY THE TOOL IF IT GOING TO BE RUINED BY THE NAIL'S HEAD ?MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING I AM MISSING HERE.$15.00 BUCKS........A STEEL IF USED PROPERLY.JOHN GRIFFITHSSPRINGFIELD, OR."
3,OK edition if there are no other options,"I absolutely love this series, so my review is strictly for the imported version of this box set. THIS IS NOT A U.S. RELEASE OF THIS SERIES! It is imported. The english subtitles are bad and picture quality is inconsistent, but the episodes are edited differently, so it seems there is slightly more content than the US release version. Only the first disc seems to include the Go Classroom epilogues, and some of the epilogues that are included completely lack subtitles. There are icons and pop up Japanese text as well as a DVR menu box that make it obvious this release was recorded on someone's home TV and repackaged for sale overseas. I do not regret the purchase and actually expected it might be like this, but I was hoping for better subtitling. I was hoping to save money this way, but I may end up buying the crazily expensive U.S. release anyway. I have not seen the movie yet, so that will be new content. If needed I will update my review at that time."
4,LONG STORY,LIKE THIS A LOT - GOOD ARTIST - STORY LINE FOLLOWS THROUGH - I COULD HAVE READ A COUPLE OF DOZEN MORE PAGES IF THERE WERE ANY
1,Not quite what I expected,"Drawing are good. But, I'm not really a fan of nude fantasy creatures having sex in black and white. I am more into human heterosexual sex in colored glossy paper."
3,It's watchable,The main problem I had with this video and the Images and Words Live video is that sometimes the full songs aren't included. Almost all the songs are interupted by interviews and behind the scenes footage. I wanted to watch a concert video and that is not what I got.
5,good information,I had lost my copy of this book and was looking for another. I like to can and this has some recipes that I couldn't find in other books. I would suggest cross-referencing with more current canning books(Ball Blue Book is good) as this is an older book. I enjoy reading it and trying some of the regular recipes as well.
5,Best Pavarotti showcase of arias,"This LP from the mid 1970's is what launched Pavarotti into the limelight. If you didn't know who Pavarotti was (and he already had a following), and you hear this recording, you most likely kept his name in mind and started searching for concerts or more records to buy. His voice was just coming into full force as a dramatic tenor yet he still had that lyrical control that could melt you.Kendall is right, this is the one Pavarotti CD to have. It best displays his talent, beautiful voice, and places him into the history books as one of the top 5 king of the high C's!"
5,sooooo exciting!!!,"I love this book so much, its one of my favorite books! Among the Hidden was good-amazing but this book is MUCH MORE amazing!!! Once you start reading this, you can't put it down! It's about a boy named Luke, who is a third child. They're not allow to keep any third children so Luke hides for his whole life. One day, he gets a fake ID and goes to the boarding school. He is so curious about everything-(don't want to give it away) so he decides to find out on his own! It's an amazing book and it's not hard! Now I'm going to read the third sequel, Among the Betrayed."
5,Awesome,Luke is a third child which is illegal where he lives so he has to hide from the population police for the rest of his life but not any more because of Jen's dad ( Jen is a best friend / shadow child who got shot during a rally with other shadow children Sept Luke ) gives Luke a fake I.D so he can live a normal life as a Barron ( Barrons are what they call very wealthy people ) named Lee Grant. Supposedly Lee Grant ran away from home so he has to attend to a school called Hendrick all boy school. If you like suspense and a fascinating twist I would highly recommend this book for you.
4,Hadix does it again,Margaret does the amazing once again in among the imposters the second book of the shadow children series.She makes her books come alive and that my peeps is talent.
3,Among the Imposters,"Among the Imposters is an excellent fiction book. It's about a boy named Luke that has to go to a boarding school named Hendricks School for Boys. In this story set in the future, the population police are people that will kill any family with more than three kids, because they're afraid that there isn't enough food. Luke makes many friends but one of them is really a child that could turn him into the population police. Will he make it or get turned in? Read this great book to find out."
4,Among the Imposters,Luke Garner is given a fake I.D. and is sent to Hendricks School for Boys with the name Lee Grant. He gets lost finding his classrooms and hates the meals. then he finds an unlocked door to the outside and meets Jason. Is he a friend or an enemy? Among the Imposters is a good book but not as good Among the Hidden.
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,I loved this book it was so good and a good mystery to! my favorite kind of book if you have not read any of her books you've got to read some.
4,3.5 Rounded...,"Although I can't say I'm hugely in love with this series, I enjoyed the first story and found this sequel an easy read. Margaret Peterson Haddix comes up with some interesting premises for her stories. In this world, a rather grim look at our future, there is a rule of two (but not the Darth Bane type.) Here, you can only have two children. Period. All third children are illegal must be hidden to avoid death.In this second story, Luke (a.k.a. Lee Grant) is getting used to his identity. He's at school for the first time in his life and dealing with everything from bullies to the strangeness of the place he's landed in.Yes, it's predictable and we can quibble over whether or not the writing is to juvenile. I'd categorize it as ""straight forward."" Like I said, Haddix has a great imagination for real-world science fiction. Her writing style is okay. The character's a little flat and a lot annoying sometimes, but overall, it's a quick read and an enjoyable story."
4,Imposters,"I don't usually like sequels as much as the original, but was pleasantly surprised with this book. The plot doesn't seem too far fetched and the characters have stayed consistent. Easy and fun to read, excited for the next one."
4,Great book,I loved this book. I only gave four stars because I got a little confused towards the end. I would recommend this book to people who like history or adventure books.
2,Not as Great as Among the Hidden,"I was exited to be reading this book because I had loved Among the Hidden. Instead, I was disappointed. There was not enough dialoge to keep it interesting, and the beggining went way to slow. The door was too sudden, and it's not clear why the door is even in Hendricks School for Boys. I still think there should have been more info about Jason and Nina.( Why were they doing that anyway???) And Mr. Hendricks showed up way too suddenly, without much information. Even though I did not like this book, I still reccomend Among the Hidden. That book was much better. I definately do NOT reccomend Just Ella. That book was horrible."
2,Hi!,"I read this book because it's a Lone Star book (6, 7 and 8th grade reading list.) I don't know why because it's a 5th grade reading level. Moving on, the whole time I was reading it, I thought it was based on The Giver. Almost everything is like what happens after Jona runs away. That annoyed me. The book is very predictable and boring. Nothing made me want ot read more. The author seems to describe everything using three words that mean the same thing. After the 43rd page, I put the book down in anger. Do people think I'm going to actually read this? At least the guy on the cover is kind of cute..."
2,windsor jr./sr. high school c.g.,i liked this book because i liked the fact that the book was a mistery but so easy to figure out at the same time i would recemand that you read this book if you are interested in third children and you don't have a week stomach
2,what i thought about the book review,"i thought that this book was special,yet i did not get into it that welll. I did not care for the first one and the second one was not much better. But it was better.the book was about luke who had to go to a school for boys and blend in. he met people but then one betrayed the other children so he wacked him with a book then all was good for the other children."
3,The woods,"Luke is skipping classes for a spirit! The book I am reading is Among the Impostors by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Luke got a note from one of his old friends who is DEAD! But, the letter is not from her, it is from her dad. No one knows what the note says. Instead of going to school like he is supposed to he goes out to the woods. One day when he was coming back in from the woods he got caught by the hall monitor. It seems that he did not learn a lesson. He goes out again and something was in the woods then pins him to the ground to the ground. He beg the thing to get off of him. When you read this book you will also find out that there is a hidden door. Luke thinks it is filled with secrets. Now these are some of the reasons you should read this book, suspended, tells you about the letter, or will he stop going to the woods, Will he tell us what he finds in the door?"
1,among the imposters,"hi my name is alexi like the first one AMONG THE HIDDEN and was exited to start to read it but then after the first 4 chapters i thought like it was a different writer , it leaves you with tHis like negitive felling , so i went on and it just got dumer becuse tHARE IT NOTHING HAPPENIG , THEY TURNED A SCINCE FICTINISH BOOK IN TO A MYSTERY JOKE :( I STARTED A YOUNGER KIDS READING GROOP WITH KIDS THAT ARE A LITTLE BEHIND OR JUST LOVE READING /BUT ME AND MY BODEYS READ THEM FIRST ,AND WE ALL QUIT READING IT,I WOULD NOT AT ALL UNDER ENEY SURCUMSTANCE EVEN IF THIS WAS THE LAST BOOK ON THE EARTH I WOULD NEVER READ IT AGAIN NO NO NO NO I AM HOPING THE 3RD WILL BE BETTER"
4,Among the imposters,"Among the Imposters was my favorite book I read this year. This book is the second book in a series about ilegal third children. The main character is a ilegal third child who was in hiding for pretty much his whole life. He was lucky enough to get a fake ID but, his name which was Luke is now Lee Grant. One day he was a poor farm boy now he's a filthy rich baron. His new rich parents send him to a school called Hendricks school for boys. His life their goes from boring to exciting after he finds a special place , usualy terifieing for third children. Personaly, this was one of the best books I've read. I liked this book because I think it would be interesting to live in a world where third children are ilegal. To find out more read Among the Imposters."
4,Among the Imposters,"Are you a third child? Well Luke Garner is and he has to hide the rest of his life from the Population Police because third children are illegal. They'll take him away if he is found out. Now for the first time Luke is living outside with others at Hendricks school for boys. Mr. Talbot, the man who is taking care Luke leaves a note hopefully to say what to do and when and where are his classes. But when Luke reads it all that it says is"" Blend in"". Then one day Luke sees a door to the outside. No one knows what the outside will bring Luke. Luke changed because now he knows not to go anywhere he doesn't know. The conflict is third children against Population police. Remember don't wander off any where don't know of. Or you could be in trouble is the theme. I give this book four stars because this book was great but it did not deserve five stars.By Tom Kralik"
5,One of his stronger books not involving Charles Carr,"Shakedown is a terrific novel about hustling in Las Vegas, in oh so many ways. It follows FBI Agent John Novak as he tracks down a set of leads that point to a Las Vegas kingpin. There's deceit and double dealing aplenty, copious amounts of blackmail, mob hits, and all the glamor of Las Vegas. Ironically for Petievich, there are 'bad guys' who are more appealing than some of the good guys, and a constant parade of willing suckers lined up to be fleeced in almost every conceivable way.More ambitiously plotted than his novels about Charles Carr, this one holds together quite well and is as good as To Die in Beverly Hills, which I loved. This is another book that is impossible to put down, but is a heck of a read. The last 50 pages defy any one to put them down.Highly recommended."
2,What a disappointing editing job!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD, a remake of an original 1986 KTel cassette tape compilation of various Christian artists, tells only half the story . . . literally! This inflated price should also present the second side of the older taped ""Rejoicing"", and then the price would be well worth it. Sadly missing are six Dove worthy recordings, at least as uplifting as the abridged version contained in this CD. Since I can copy my cassette to a CD for about a nickel, it will take more than this chopped CD to get my $40.00."
5,Great product!,I've used this detector for some 20 hours as of this review and really love it. The best reward so far was finding a little girls ring at the beach. Great tool for the biginner and Pro alike. I recommend it to anyone.
4,Garrett Ace 150 - my boys have enjoyed it,My boys have enjoyed it (11 and 8). They haven't found any treasure yet. But they haven't given up just yet either. I have never owned one of these before so I cannot say how it compared to others. But it seems to beep when it should beep. The beeps don't match up 100% of the time to what we should find according to the type of beep. But I'd say it's close to 90% accuracy which isn't bad for one of the more inexpensive models.
1,Tons of false readings,"We thought it would be fun to take up metal detecting, having 2 boys who love the idea of treasure hunting. But sadly this metal detector gives nothing but false readings. It is very erratic. I even changed the new batteries, thinking they may be the problem, but just got the same from this product. Buy something else. Not this one. I don't know if we'll buy something better or not. I would hate to keep spending money on metal detectors, but I'm sure they're not all this bad."
5,Better then I thought!,I love my new metal detector! I have spent many hours on the beach with it and have found many interesting things. I recommend the Garrett metal detector to everybody. It's really easy to use.
5,Excellent,It is the best that i had have for years it is great i love my metal detector i even had found coins metals well a lot of things i recomended you will have a lot of fun plus adventure this seller it is great with communication i will always recomend this product with them they even got me free the head phones the bag plus suprise wodden nickel coins thank you
3,channson electrica,"Evidente la similitud que intenta tener con Dominique A aunque en momentos te de la sensasion de que suena como la version francesa de Magnetic fields. Incluso sin tener nocion alguna de frances te sorprenderas a ti mismo tarareando las canciones de este sujeto que tiene una clara idea de como escribirlas. Hace sonar los teclados como unos Future Bible Heroes en depresion. Derrama miel en momentos pero logra que sea mas agrio que dulce.NOTASeguramente se escucha mejor si tienes cerca a alguien a quien abrazar, hace un insuperable score de l'amour"
5,Great Story,Dorothy Garlock is one of the best romance writers of our time. This book is just one example of her outstanding work. This is one of the first books from her that I read. Since then I have read almost all of them. I can not say enough about Larkspur. If you haven't read it then I definately reccommend that you order it right now. I too would like to see more stories with any of the Tallmans in it.
1,Junk,"I purchased this item. It worked well for about 3-4 months. Then 2 dark vertical bands appeared on the monitor. It was definitely a problem with the monitor. I payed another $100 to have it fixed, then it happed again. PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
4,Worthwhile Read,"This is my first Steve Hamilton book and as an author I enjoyed his often unhero like hero Alex McKnight. Hamilton's word artistry had me cringing at the pain one man can inflict on another and at his apt discription of a cold snow-encrusted winter. I plan to share ""Winter of the Wolf Moon"" with all of my reading buddies and I look forward to purchasing another Hamilton novel.Beverly J Scott author of RIGHTEOUS REVENGE and RUTH FEVER"
3,Not as good as some of the others,"I have read most of the McKnight series and I did not like this one nearly as much. I thought the action dragged and the story was wrapped up strangely in my opinion. I do enjoy the fact that these books do not have to be read in order to enjoy them. However, every single book mentions the death of his partner many times over and this can get old quickly if you read several of his books in a row."
2,Winter of the Wolf Moon,"A disturbing disappointment from a promising author. Hamilton asks us to suspend disbelief just a little too far. The work is full of unbelievable incidents, not the least of which is the presence of (anti)hero,Alex McKnight. The author gives us nothing on which to build a belief in the characters or the scenario of the book. Raymond Chandler should sleep soundly. A random piecemeal work, not given to luring the unsuspecting reader into the mistake of expecting drama, excitement or a finely honed, masterfully crafted mystery. This one goes to the local library second -hand sale table.Two stars is, I believe, being charitable."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent mystery. It has believable characters, a very good mystery, a knack for making the reader feel at home in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, an easy style, and Alex is a very likeable protagonist. Also, Hamilton's descriptions of winter are extremely vivid. I can't wait for Hamilton's next book. There is one error that I feel compelled to point out. On page 32 Hamilton writes that there are one or two Beer Stores ""in every town in Canada, from Vancouver to Prince Edward Island."" That is incorrect: the Beer Store can be found only in Ontario. (He is correct when he says it's a wonderful place.) A very small point, but still ..."
4,Another good one!,"Again, this writer continues to remind me of William Tapply (in a good way!) And again, like the first book in the series, we are left slightly hanging at the end, without the real bad guy getting his due. And again, a hint that the villian will get his in the next novel...so I am reading away!"
3,Milodragovich Lite,This is my first Steve Hamilton novel. I liked the Alex McKnight character. Sort of reminds me of James Crumley's Milo Milodragovich--only not quite as much booze and drugs.
3,Boring,"I like the Alex McKnight character, but the plot is too slow in developing. I just started skipping whole pages."
2,dissappointing after all the positive reviews,"I read several of the reviews about the various books in this series, and thought I'd love them, entertaining genre. I found a great technical writer, but a hero who is egocentric, arrogant, a bully, and the antithesis of the kind of central character I like to identify with. But, then perhaps I read these stories with a different mindset -- I like to identify with the hero, and this is one that I want no part of. Talk about ""real friends"", the way the author makes this obnoxious character's friends stick by him in spite of abuse and mistreatment gives new meaning to that concept. No more of this series in my collection, thank you."
2,Not that great!!,"This phone worked for a little while, now when you make a call out you hear clicks. A little annoying. If someone calls you, the clicks aren't quite so loud. I like the style of the phone, it doesn't take up much space sitting on the counter. I would not purchase this phone, unless you want one that works about a month."
2,Not Great.,Bought this phone (without answering system). Great price but not much else. Reception poor for a 2.4G. Caller I.D. is hit and miss. Difficult to read display. Seems well made but simply not a great product. Had a 900 MHZ Panasonic prior that was much better.
1,"Great looks, poor Quality","The phone looks great. That is the best thing I can say about it. You can barely hear the person on the other line. The reception is TERRIBLE. There is constant static, no matter how many times I change the channel. Answering machine is also very low in sound quality. Sadly, I am taking it back right now..."
4,Good cordless/digital recorder,"Had this phone for about a month. Am happy with the signal, ease of use, and unit in general. Nothing seems to not work well and the signal is great."
2,Answering machine does not work properly,"My boyfriend and I bought this phone at Target about one month ago. We liked the look, the price,the fact that it was cordless, from a great brand, and that it had an answering machine. It was easy to start using it. The battery last long but the ringing tones are way too low. It works well by the microwave although we get some static. We were shocked when we started to get messages we could not hear. The voice on the machine goes up and down so badly that it is impossible to determine who was on the phone and what they were saying. We are about to go back to Target to return it. Thank God we have the receipt!!!"
1,It was OK while it lasted,"Eventually buttons, especially 1 & 2, stopped working. You had to really press it to dial it. I would recommend the product to someone who changes phones every 3 month."
2,Bummer,This is the fourth cordless phone I've tried since the one I had died. This was the best of the four but still is not a winner. The really only good part is the rubber grip on the side of the handset so its easy to hold on to. The voice fades while your talking to someone and its hard to find just the right spot to put your ear so you can hear well.
3,not the best out there,"I registered for this phone on my bridal registry. When I didn't get it as a gift it was the first thing that I bought because I loved the look of it. The phone has its ups and downs. It is a comfortable and easy to use phone. However, it does not have a very good connection. It always has static and a crinkling noise that gets louder. Good phone if you are going for looks of it but not a good phone if you are going for quality."
3,"Nice, but not quite what I need","I like the phone. It looks great and seems like a winner from the start. The first month went well.. but I noticed that there were some sound issues. First thing to note: this phone is not digital. Secondly the volume is almost always too low. I don't know why. It just is. Lastly, the battery was great at first but now into its third month the battery is dying constanty no matter how much it is charged. I have had many many phones.. I am one tough taskmaster when it comes to phones.. this one doesn't quite hold up."
2,unreliable,"I bought this phone because I wanted one that had a ringer off switch. It also has one of the best rings of any phone I have owned. However, an important component of this phone is the answering machine and it is very unreliable. It will inexplicably replay deleted messages as new ones. This is a very puzzling problem and one that is serious, especially if you are a job seeker or are awaiting important news. If you don't care about the answering machine then it is an okay phone, otherwise skip it."
3,Not too Bad,"I have had the Motorola 2.4GHz for a few months. Overall, it is a good phone, but there are a few minor inconveniences. The phone doesn't allow you to check the messages while you are on the phone, or when the receiver is off the hook. Also, it doesn't distinguish between new and old messages. The messages are time and date stamped, but when you press play, it starts at the beginning of all messages, and does not tell you which of those is new. Those are just minor design problems. Otherwise, the phone is cute, easy to hold, and has a lot of other nice features."
3,BETTER THAN OUR LAST PHONE,"My Husband and I bought this phone a few months ago, after our old phone died.I am impressed with the features and with how long the batterie lasts before having to recharge. We can keep the phone off the charger for 7 whole days before it needs to be recharged.Bad Qualities:Ringer is not loud enough, Very Very Bad reception, we live in a two bedroom house, and reception is bad in our bedroom, and in the basement, and outside.Our old phone was beat up and the battery did not last 7 days, but at least I could take it outside with me.. and at least when I was outside I could hear the phone ring inside.."
2,Not bad but there is better,"At the time of purchase (nearly a year ago), it seemed like the prudent choice. The hand set feels balanced and well shaped and the grippable sides are a big plus. A major caveat is that there is no toll-saver feature for the answering machine. Nor fast forward or rewind. You can only skip or repeat the entire message. As for the headset, there is a volume control, but the other party hears a break in the signal as the volume is being switched. A not-so-minor thing on a business call. Also the switch to turn off the ringer is difficult to work. It seems jammed on the case or something. I've had the phone for almost a year and just recently the head-set jack has failed (I tried a couple of different head-sets). Over-all a less than satisfactory experience."
2,Disappointed,This is the second one I have had. The first one didn't last 2 months. This one and it won't dial the numbers right. The keyboard back light is gone. And the caller id was always hard to read. But there are some nice features. I have Parkinson's and the grips on the sides make it easy to grip. I have never had a problem with static. One problem is kind of unique.......when I am working in the basement with my iTunes on and a get a call it shuts off my iTunes.........at least I know that I have a call coming in and i don't have to run to the computer to turn the sound down. If these pnones wouldn't break they are just what I like because I don't need a lot of features.
1,Horrible phone system,"Answering system RANDOMLY answers phone calls. Motorola won't fix it, horrible customer service. Now phone ringer is barely audible. I'm ready to throw this system into the garbage!"
2,Disappointed,Disappointed! My spouse has a broken ankle so main reason I ordered this model was for remote answer function and wall mount capability. Remote answer works fine but the package did not include wall mount. There was a paper insert that said call a toll free number for wall mount. I did two months ago still no wall mount. I would not recommend this phone.
2,The Opposite of Good is...,In the almost three years of having owned this phone it's only been solid 2 months. The answering machine function is reliable - hence the two stars. Motorola did send a (free) replacement battery which lasted as long as the first: 6 months. You'll get 30 seconds of use from your phone for every 30 minutes it's charged. (So make sure your phone calls are short so it doesn't cut you off)Look elsewhere.
1,Poor sound on the answering machine,"We bought this phone less than a year ago. The phone itself is ok, it picks up some interference from our wireless network but it's ok for a 2.4 GHz. The answering machine didn't have the clearest sound quality when we bought it but the messages left were understandable so we kept the system. Now, less than a year later the sound quality when playing back messages has degraded to the point that you can not understand the messages at all. I thought it might be the speaker phone but ruled that out since the sound quality is perfect when checking the date and time. It's a digital recorder so I'm not sure what would be causing the poor quality on playback but guess that it must have something to do with the recording device. Final analysis, you can get better quality for your money."
1,DON'T JUDGE A PHONE BY ITS BRANDNAME,I brought this phone because I had someone who gave it the highest praise. After using this phone I am not sure if this person was just crazy or maybe they just don't know any better. There are only 2 ringer settings on the phone and that is low &amp; lower! Sometimes the phone just cuts off mid-conversation and I dare not go out in front of my house. I can not walk around without the phone giving me serious static and to change the channel is USELESS. The best feature on the phone is the answering machine. Don't be fooled this phone is NOT WORTH IT!
3,Almost OK,"I bought this phone several months ago on a recommendation. Well, it's a nice looking phone and the base is compact. I do like that it has a ringer on/off switch (many phones nowadays don't have that feature anymore). However, the quality of the reception is just awful! And changing the channel is manual. In addition, it is not very comfortable against the ear.So, I'm back to the search for the perfect cordless phone...."
2,Could Be Better,"Being given the ability to access the answering machine from the handset makes this design a nice idea, and the sound quality from the handset isn't bad, but that is the extent of my praise.I do not care for the answering machine as it has very limited features; no fast forward, rewind, etc. The quality of sound is very poor, and most of my messages are not clear enough to be understood.The worst problem I've had is the phone's battery ""dies"" all too often! I've had the phone in the base for 48 hours, and after a 5 minute phone call it will give a low battery warning, and soon die out.I've not been satisfied with this phone, and after two months of use am looking for a replacement. Save your money and look for something else!"
2,POS,"this phone looks cool, I'll give it that. I also like the rubber siding which gives it a great feel in your hand.BUT the sound is not good. It is kinda soft when listening to the other person, and it really amplifies your own voice (and ambient noise) and pipes it to your ear which is annoying. And this phone, like some others, for some crazy reason, gives out a loud beep (heard by you and the other person) whenever you switch the volume during a call. WHY????? Then the other person says 'what the hell was that?' and you have to explain. But that is a small detail, basically the sound is bad and therefore I am returning it without even trying the answering machine."
3,Searching for the perfect phone.,"I purchased this phone 2 months ago. I like the simplicity of changing the hour and time and accessing/deleting messages. However, Motorola needs to improve the quality of the volume. It's difficult to hear the other party and I can never find the right spot for the headset to feel comfortable on my ear. I do like the rubber grips and the caller I.D. function. It's fine for now, but the search is on for the perfect phone."
2,Great phone except...,"I like the phone for everything it offers. Ease of use, great reception, etc. However, there is a problem that I can't stand. The quality of the answering machine is horrible. To record an outgoing message, I have to speak loudly right into the base otherwise it is very difficult to hear the message. And the incoming messages are very difficult to understand. I've had many hard times trying to decipher the phone numbers left by callers. And in order to review the message, it has to be replayed in its entirety; so I spend a lot of time having to replay the messages over and over again in order to understand what's being said."
1,Given another chance I would not buy this phone,The problems:You cannot retrieve messages away from home -- although the specs read you can.After one year the battery is dying. I don't overuse my phone nor do I leave it off the cradle for long periods.For this price I expect to receive what the advertisment touts.
1,OWNED FOR 1 DAY,This phone was difficult to read keypad plus I.D. but the worst feature was how it hurt my ear. I returned it in a day.
1,Disappointed with Motorola,"Two months after purchasing this phone Caller ID began to fail. Sometimes the number would show but now for every call I get it displays ""NO DATA."" It's a piece of you know what...I have other phones that I put on the same line only switching this phone out and everything is good.Good luck to any who buy this.Disappointed with Motorola"
1,Terrible phone,"What a waste of money. The answering machine quality is horrible. Most messages are garbled and cannot be understood, even with the volume maxed out. The battery died a few months after purchase. Even the sound quality of the handpiece is poor. There is a short in the power source line - if the phone's bumped, it shuts off. I believe the phone is a waste of money. The handpiece is heavy and bulky. I will stick w/ Panasonic."
2,Not a good phone...,"First of all, I couldn't even hear mine ringing. I set it up, called it from my cell, and could barely hear either the ring on the base unit or the handset.My hearing is just fine, but the ring on this model is pathetically quiet. If you aren't physically in the same room with the phone, good luck hearing the little electronic bleeps that signal an incoming call.Also, no matter what channel I set it on, mine had some static or &quot;white noise&quot; coming through the handset during a conversation. Not crystal clear, like you would expect from a 2.4 gig phone.Finally, the handset isn't very big, and feels awkward in your hand. I got mine as a gift, and after a few days, exchanged it.There are other phones in the price range, this one isn't a winner. Hope this helps."
1,Miserable,"This phone is a poor excuse for a communications device. Bad ergonomics, confusing controls, miserable sound both ways.I have owned mine for maybe a month. Am now looking for a replacement.BAD CHOICE."
3,"Basic, but not brilliant","I was really hoping for more from a Berlitz publication. I like the idea, but some of the translations are not correct. There are lots of words that I would have expected in a children's book that are absent. I much prefer LET'S LEARN ITALIAN PICTURE DICTIONARY MCGRAW HILL. That is sorted by subject matter and so much easier to absorb."
3,It DOES do multichannel audio,"Just FYI for fellow readers, the SACD/DVD-A multichannel audio is provided through its analog outputs - it will only do stereo through its digital outputs. Therefore it does do multichannel audio, just not through the digital outputs."
2,"Excellent picture, but it freezes and skips.","I bought this player to be able to see DVDs upgraded to HDTV resolutions on a DLP projector, but the 720p-1080i resolutions are only output via DVI, and my projector only has analog inputs, so the HD upgrade would not work for me. Still, the 480p output via composite produced an excellent picture, but unfortunately the player would freeze and skip from time to time, even on brand new DVDs, so I had to return it. After doing some research on the internet, I found that others have also experienced freezing and skipping problems with Samsung DVD players, so rather than exchanging it for another Samsung that might do the same thing, I got a Sony instead--so far it plays smoothly and flawlessly, with an equally excellent picture. Sound quality on the Samsung was excellent. The remote was rather complicated and not really very responsive."
5,Stunning Picture,"While it took me a few attempts to get the whole video configuration set up properly to use the DVI cable, the results are well worth it! In the package, I found a special page of instructions on how to hook up to DVI-capable televisions, which helped a lot. Another hint for Sony LCD/DLP Projection TV owners: The DVI signal came through on ""Video 7"" channel for me. Once I found that detail out, the rest was a snap.Once it was all hooked up, the first movie we watched was Shrek 2. The picture was what I'd hoped for from an HD system, with details showing that a VCR could never imagine, and few DVD players could replicate. I finally feel like my Sony LCD TV was worth the extra money for high definition!The remote is overly busy and will take some getting used to. But, now that we've got the Samsung DVD player configured, all we really need to do is slip in a disk and press play!"
2,"Some good, more bad",I hook this up to a 44-inch LCOS set via the DVI cable. Good picture but it was very dark (was correctable with adjustments to the TV). Remote is horrendous and this is a real showstopper for me.
1,Doesn't do Surround Sound for DVD-A and SACD,"Got this unit hoping to upgrade from a Pioneer universal player. I couldn't believe it when I found out that it didn't do multi-channel out in surround sound. So, you can only listen to DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD's in stereo, which is just a waste, in my opinion. What's just as confusing is that the unit actually has the analog output for surround. Why it has it when it doesn't use it is beyond me. As far as picture goes, it's great. But when you're looking for a player to play high-end audio at a low price, you're better off with going with the Pioneer DV-578A. This unit does analog surround and costs less than this Samsung."
2,twice the price half the player,"i don't rate many products but this needs to be said.the setup on this dvd player is stupid. i've had to call into tech support three times to resolve issues. worse, the tech agent himself told me how stupid the setup is and that they should atleast put the instructions in the manual.beyond that the remote is a horrid. i've only had one other dvd player and perhaps i'm spoiled, but this remote doesn't work unless pointed directly at the dvd player at the exact height. again, maybe i'm spoiled but my last remote could be bounced off almost any wall in the house. on one of my 3 calls the ""tech"" told me to buy better batteries which ofcourse didn't help at all. the only reason i gave this thing 2 stars is because i have noticed a better picture with SOME, but not all dvds. Samsung best get their act together because this is the second bad product i've owned with their name on it."
4,Pretty good for the money,"I am not sure which output was used in one of the previous review, but the output from DVI to my projector for 110"" screen is very comparable to more expensive player. Of course the projector has to be re-tuned (AVI disc in my case). And, as some folks already mentioned, you will have to make sure you have the lastest firmware is on the player, which resolved many thing including the DTS sound track issue. You can download it from samsung web site.I have two of these and Bravo D1 fitted with SONY DVD-ROM drive, and 841 handles the bad disc better than D1. Properly turned, the picture quality is not bad.I am giving 4 stars because of the annoying subtitle thing. It should not display the subtitle by default. I have to turn the subtitle off every time, which can be quite annoying..."
3,If it worked...,"I would have given it 5 stars. The sound was some of the best sound I have heard from a DVD player. The Picture was brighter and clearer. It was not true HD, but the nest that we can have until it comes. That is why I would not recomend spending more than $300 on one of these HD-DVD players.The problem was that it was not compatible with my HDCP compliant TV (JVC 34"" HDTV). I would have to hope that it worked. I would have to keep plugging and unplugging the DVI cable in order for the picture to come on. The same thing after deparately trying to test three of them.I am STILL waiting on the elusive Panasonic DVD-S97S. What's up with that one? I am a second away from just not waiting anymore and going with a Denon."
2,Please don not buy this product...,"I had given 2 star because it works fine with Progessive scan (420P), I have JVC Progressive(bouught for $89.00) scan DVD player and compared picture quality with ths DVD player using DVI input in Hitachi Plasama tv, but surprise not at all found any difference. The only is TV signal shows 1080i, But you can not get the quality the one which you get it from HD cable Telivision (HD Discovery or HD Hbo).They are really 1080i resolution.I am going to return this DVD player today and happy with my JVC DVD Player.Please away from this product better use low cost Progressive scan."
1,Up-conversion seriously flawed,"I recently purchased this unit keeping in mind others' concerns with the black crush issue. For those that don't know, the DVI connection mangles dark blacks into a single color, rendering darker scenes nearly impossible to distinguish. I viewed the Return of the King when Frodo was in Shelob's lair and nothing was discernible. Even in Shrek 2, a colorful movie, the backgrounds were so dark that all you could see at some points was the characters themselves. Both movies were viewd on a Sony 42"" lcd projection tv. The component outputs work fine, but you might as well by a regular progressive scan if you intend to use those. Basically, for what this player is intended to do, it fails. For a much better unit, for a cheaper price, try the Toshiba SD-5970. It upconverts through HDMI, but I bought a HDMI-DVI converter for $30, it works great, and it's still cheaper than the Samsung 841. Take the advice of others listed here as well and stay away from the 841."
3,To Use DVI you must have HDCP compliant TV\Monitor,"I had difficulty with this unit. It would play DVD's I made myself, but not any store bought DVD's through the DVI Cable. I called up Samsung support and found out that unless your TV is HDCP compliant then it will not play store bought DVD's through the DVI Cable. This unit only up converts through the DVI cable, so unless your TV\Monitor is HDCP compliant, do not expect it to work properly. (HDCP is a copy protection built into your hardware to prevent copying of the Movie)."
1,Doesn't meet the hype,"You must be joking. I hooked this product up to my Sony 50"" Grand WEGA LCD HDTV and the picture quality was mediocre at best. Use of the DVI connection results in the infamous ""black crush"" problem where black is just too black -- anything with any black around it is rendered black as well. So bad as to be unwatchable. When I switched to using the component inputs instead, it plays only at 480p, and this was only marginal.My Pioneer Elite DV-37 has a *much* better picture than this Samsung, even at 480p. I know I shouldn't have expected the $199 Samsung to compete with my $1000 Pioneer DV-37, but Samsung has really hyped this player beyond reality.This was my most disappointing electronics purchase of 2004 thus far.Kevin"
1,Not even for $20,"Thinking about the Samsung HD-841 - forget it! That player is horrible. Frequently froze up, refused to play many brands of DVD-Rs and would not play DVD+R DL discs. Buy the Toshiba SD-6980 instead. The Toshiba player handles all of the DVD-R and DVD+R I've thrown at it and plays DVD+R DLs as well. Also does a great job with DVD-Audio and SACD."
1,A real Dog,"Skip-Stall-Skip-Stall-Skip-Stall after trying two units with my optical audio and DVI cables connected, this second unit is going back to the store. Stereo sound only - multi-channel surround sound a no go!! Can you believe it? A very frustrating and disappointing DVD player. Everything the other reviewers have said about this unit's problems is true - buy something else-I am."
3,Eh...it's okay...,"Just as a note, the DTS skipping problem I was able to resolve by updating the firmware on the unit. You can download the firmware from Samsung's site. After that, DTS sound worked great and I didn't have anymore skipping.The problem I have is that it doesn't seem to want to output Dolby Digital to my receiver...it's sending a signal that gets detected as Dolby Pro Logic by my receiver which auto-detects the correct surround format. It's not my receiver as my comcast box sends out digital 5.1 and the receiver detects it correctly.This dvd player has been okay, but it's just clunky. I haven't had too many problems with the remote and not had any problems with the display. It works on par with any DVD player, but nothing special.When you can buy an Oppo-Digital DVD player for about the same price or lower, it just doesn't make much sense."
1,Will the Tinkers never learn?,"Completely agree with the two reviews posted below. The sound quality is poor, and once again the Tinkers have succumbed to the urge to do a vocal track. C'mon guys....get back to doing what you do very very well and can the vocals!"
5,Fun folk bagpipe and drum band!,"Saw them live, bought the cd, and now I have hours of bagpipes blowing out my truck windows. The drums, various drones, and occasional vocals add to the variety. I love 'em!"
4,I love the didgeridoo,"Going into it, I knew what to expect on this album. We'd already bought the CD. But, I like it so much that I wanted a copy on my mobile phone.The album is appropriately named -- it is LOUD. Well, perhaps ""raucous"" or ""exuberant"" might be better terms. It's Celtic music with a kick. Think of them as The Chieftans, on steroids. The group sure knows how to deliver renditions that, at times, make the hair on my arms prickle. The artful weaving of a didgeridoo, Scottish Great Pipes and war drums with the standard Celtic instruments adds a wild, etheral feel to the music. On a dark night, I can almost imagine the barrows opening and releasing their occupants.Seriously, though, if you enjoy Celtic music, you might want to give this album a listen. You may find yourself tempted, as my husband and I were, to get the other CDs by this group, too."
5,smooth and classy,"This is one of the most beautiful recordings of standards I have heard. Engelbert's voice is smooth, coupled with lovely orchestrations, provides the listener with 19 songs of love and relaxation."
5,Great for Kids,"This is a fun little cookbook for kids or kids at heart. No there are not any gourmet recipes in here, but this is a great cookbook for those adults who have to follow instructions on a box of macaroni and cheese. Simple recipes. We really love the sloppy joe recipe...I never thought to add pickles."
5,A Classic Kid's Recipe book still relevant today!,"I used my Mom's original copy from when she was a kid as I was growing up. I'm 22 now and I hope I can one day give this book to my children! Other reviewers noted differences in the old verses the new, and they are correct. There is no longer an easy orange cake or icing.I never made those anyway. What I do remember is the classic eggnog, good kid cookies, my boy scout camping trip where we made dough boys, eggs in a frame, and so many other favorite recipes from my childhood.I've since graduated to the original Betty Crocker's Cookbook from 1950, but this book is always nearby at hand for the fun recipes that I enjoyed as a Child. A great family heirloom to hand down!"
4,Creating a stir,"Nirvana for the pre-EZ Bake Oven set. But even in the name of unadulterated mid-century nostalgia, was it really necessary to reprint the racially-offensive recipe for ""Ole Black Joe,"" a breakfast abomination in which a wrinkled prune is dolled up to resemble the face of an elderly Afro-American man? Really bad taste in more ways than one!!!"
5,Great Time Travel Book,I had this cookbook as a child and purchased it for the memories. I also wanted to see if memory served me correctly and it would be of benefit to my grandaughters. It's easy and simple and perfect for young cooks. Some of the instructions for proper manners show the changes in lifestyles from the 1950's to today and are good for a laugh.
2,book setup not kid user friendly,I was disappointed in this book. I didn't realize that it was so small. We also ended up having to remove the picture pages so the rest of the pages would turn smoothly and not tear. It seems they have too many pages for the size of the spiral in the binding.
4,Cookbook for younger children wanting to learn to cook,My grandaugher and I are enjoying the cookbook togethere. She gets excited to come and visit to use her book.
3,Too many prepared foods,"I was a bit disappointed with this cookboook. Too many of the recipes called for box cake mixes or bisquick. I was hoping for more ""from scratch"" recipes."
5,The best,A fantastic recording with the best singers for a difficult and not very known opera. A great success !
5,What is Wrong With People?,"Michael Le Van is one of the purest pianists since the Gershwin age and no one is listening? I understand that he isn't in with the popular music. It's sad that synthetic music has taken over so much that no one can appreciate the arts of classical music. Maybe if it was 50 Cent of Taylor Hicks (everyone is making SUCH a big deal about that dude) then maybe someone would listen. As for me I am with classical. It's nice to listen to real music and appreciate those other acts such as Chopin. Lets not allow the music of the arts die because of synthetic, mess with your voice to make it sound better, garbage that is infiltrating the airwaves."
5,The Parallel Triangle,There are no words that can describe the details of this book. The wonderfully developed characters were paired up with an extraordinary story. By reading this book you will set yourself on a journey filled with struggles. You will not want to put the book down because you get caught up in the characters and truly want to know where the book is going to take you and how it is going to end. You will also find yourself reading the book as slowly as possible to allow yourself the opportunity to live in the book for as long as possible. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
1,Bad customer service........,"I never received the 4-year plan, when I purchased the TVHD in August 2006. I have wrote to Amazon several times with no follow up by Amozon.My next step is legal, since Amazon is acting like it dosen't care about the customer.The reason I both the TVHD was because of 4-year service plan.Terrible customer service......."
1,Warning about extended warranty on bank cards,"It is true that you may have an extended warranty (double up to 1 yr)with your bank card, but be careful. The extended warranty is probably not on both a credit and a debit card. It depends on the contract your bank has made. There are different sets of benefits. In general, it seems the debit cards have this, but not credit cards, so be sure to pay with the correct one.In the case of Master Card at least, it is very difficult to tell because the benefits brochures do not distinguish between credit and debit cards. Check with your bank. Even then, the person you get on the phone may not know what you're talking about."
1,You May Not Need It,"Check with your credit card companies. Both American Express and Visa automatically double the manufacturer's warrantee at no cost if you use their card for the purchase!! So if your manufacturer offers 1 year at no cost then you can get 2 years at no cost by using one of the participating credit card companies at the point of purchase.These warranties aren't very good on ""lemons"" and they always say that if the tv lasts 2 years it's probably going to last 5 years..."
3,"Neither bad, nor good!","This book fails completely on its intent, simply because it isn't strong neither as a theoretic book, as was intended by his author Kolsky, nor have exercises or examples. So it is a complete disaster as a text book on this subject. there are more than five, or more books on this same subject pretty much better, superior, so why to buy this book?I'm just being sincere, honest, the only thing Kolsky did here is to select chapters about waves in solids of several books and reunited in this book, trying to turn it into a kind of reference one, but failed.Sincerely, Amazon have way better books on the same subject!"
4,"Great voice, but Yesterday is Now is better!","I had David's Yesterday is Now album for a while before getting this one, and I loved it. Taking the Wheel is a great recording as well, but I much prefer the other CD. David's voice is, as usual, amazing, but there is just something lacking in the choice of songs. While some tracks are particularly memorable (the title song is my favorites), others seem to just be there. It is a wonderful CD overall though - I would recommend it, but if you're familiar with Yesterday is Now, be prepared for a little disappointment."
3,Misses the mark,David Campbell undeniably has a spectacular voice. But his song selections here do not highlight or elevate this voice--mainly because the songs he selected are either uninteresting or have uninteresting arrangements. Sentimentality drips off some of these songs.
1,Overrated and overemoting!,"I've played this CD a number of times, and I don't get it. Campbell's got a thin, reedy voice, and his interpretations are rather run-of-the-mill. All I get is a kid who can't decide whether he wants to be a pop-rock star or a classic crooner. Does he wanna be Michael Jackson or Michael Feinstein? What a waste of time!"
1,"Absolutely, positively the worst Austin map ever","I've lived in Austin for 33 years, and I thought that a small, plastic map would be good if I heard an unfamiliar street name. My idea may be good, but this map is terrible. At best, it shows Central Austin, but calling it an Austin map is wrong. If you know anything about Austin, consider this: It shows nothing north of 45th street and Camp Mabry. On the east side it stops around Pleasant Valley and Berkman. Going south, it stops at Zilker Park. (Almost nothing south of the river is shown.) Going west, it does show Rollingwood and Westlake Hills. The downtown detail map on the back is o.k., but it's already out of date. The ""Area Map"" on the back only goes to Pflugerville (north), Decker Lake but not Manor (east), the airport (south), and Sunset Valley (west). Don't buy this map! It's worse than the freebies from the hotel or a car rental agency or inside the phone book."
1,Streetwise Austin map,"I guess I got the wrong map, is a City Center Street Map and doesn't help me at all. I need a map of the neighborhoods in Austin."
2,I Prefer the Hotel Map,"As title said, I prefer using the map I got from the hotel I stayed in than this map. Wish the Professor Pathfinder has published an Austin TX map.."
3,"A Bit Dated, but Interesting","This book is a little out of date. The funniest aspect of this was the author's prediction (in the 80's) that his spiritual journey was part of a general movement of evangelicals back into mainline churches. Well, that sure never happened.Reading the book, I couldn't help wondering what those evangelicals who then joined the Episcopal Church USA now think about their church with its non-celibate homosexual bishop and the various deviations from the historic Christian faith. It also left me curious about how many of these people have become part of the current trend towards joining the Orthodox or Roman Catholic Churches.While I'm glad I finally read this book, I'm also glad I didn't spend too much on it at the used book store."
3,Get what you pay for.,"This CD is decent but does NOT sweep you off your feet into a soaring concert hall with your heart beating loudly and your breaths coming in faster. Why? I think its the quality of the recording and the caliber of the musicians maybe? But hey, $4.98 does not buy much more than a fast food meal- so no harm done! Happy Listening!-Rupa"
4,If only the Amazon discography was as good...,The majority of the musical selections is undeniably fine. If only the track listing (s) were accurate or agreed with each other and the actual selections as they are ordered on the CD!
2,Stick with NPR,"I bought this book after hearing Randy Cohen on NPR. In extremely small doses, he is sometimes amusing as he addresses topics that made me think. However in book form his ""style"" translates into simply being annoying. The author may think he is being funny in how he tries to insert his own political views (whether it has anything to do with the topic at hand or not), but I don't. Save your money and just listen to him on NPR."
1,Disappointingly Filled with Unethical Advice,"This disappointing book that is made up of New York Times ethics columns shows that the guy who writes it is not very ethical himself. He seems to have no standards of behavior, just whatever whim hits him. He attempts to be humorous and glib when he should be more serious. Bottom line is that Randy Cohen is the wrong guy to write the column and this book. This is so bad that I couldn't even finish it because it got so frustrating to read his illogical advice."
2,not what I was hoping for,"This is not what I was hoping for at all, I thought it would give more pointers to people on what is and is not appropriate to say or do in the workplace. It just didn't work for me at all."
1,Ethics?...Where?,"Mr. Cohen is in dire need of the admittedly lax editorial standards of The New York Times. In this book, any and all causes that conflict with Mr. Cohen's leftist leanings are pronounced ""unethical"".Would that politics be discounted, his book is mediocre at best. And then, only for the most discerning. It is an effort to wade through the muck."
1,he should practice what he preaches,"This author used a recent television appearance to promote this book as a chance to share his political views. How ""ethical"" is that?"
2,That's it?,"This was entertaining at first but quickly grew boring. This should be viewed as a quirky read, to be read in snippets or given as a gift to the right individual (if you don't know who that is, don't get it for them). This is not something you're meant to sit down with on Saturday and pore over until Sunday morning.There were some interesting situations, but like I said, I grew bored with the premise quickly. The topics here would make for a spirited debate, but as it stands, you're just reading one person's opinion, no matter how good, bad or inconsistent. Cohen tries to spice it up with others' opinions every once in awhile, but that wasn't enough. And Cohen himself isn't likable, hatable, or controversial enough to make the book work. Maybe get this from the library, but don't take the chance spending money on it."
4,Thought provoking,"As expected, a book expounding one man's ""solution"" to ethical dilemmas would elicit a wide range of opinions. I agree somewhat with some of Mr. Cohen's detractors arguments regarding his opinions and even some of his personal motivations. However, that is not the only criterion by which such a book should be judged.What I like about the book is the exposition of a wide range of personal and professional dilemmas, many of which I would never think about. While I don't personally agree with the authors response all of the time, I appreciate the opportunity to form opinions of my own should a similar or analogous situation arise in my own life. It is for inclusion of a wide range of thought-provoking situations that I give this book ""4""."
2,Fly united instead,"2 1/2Despite creating comfortable cushions of angular noise to fall into, there is little meat on these apathetically experimental bones, barely masking third-rate Canned recyclables with inane noise manipulation to rarely produce moments of genuine vitality, as a brief final transition reminds."
1,Horrible Design,"Let me first say, I love the look and idea behind this phone...I am a big Disney addict, BUT whoever designed this phone should be fired! I have 2 kids and I work out of my home and need to use the phone a lot. I cannot even count how many times I have hung up on poor unsuspecting souls on the other end. If you even press the phone into your ear too hard while holding on to it, it will hang up! And, the caller id feature is horrible also. It constantly misses calls. I do not use this phone anymore! (but I keep it plugged in because I like the Mickey Music when I get calls)"
5,****WHAT A GREAT PHONE****,"I love my new mickey mouse phone. YES, I admit I got it for myself. I got it for my birthday and since I am over the hill. This phone makes me feel young at heart. I look forward to getting calls and my kids just love it."
2,Phones don't last long,"My family has owned two of these phones now. The first one simply stopped working - the handset would turn on, but was unable to make a signal connection with the base.The second one worked for much longer (nearly a year) before the Talk button on the handset started to require obscene amounts of pressure to turn the phone on. And then we discovered just recently that the power supply was running at excessive temperatures. Rather than risk a fire hazard, we've simply stopped using the phone.This phone works as a gimmick, but don't expect your money to go very far."
1,Motorola Quality not worth paying for,I own the Motorola Disney Telephone. Liked its looks and thought Motorola would be a good make.What a disappointment. The Telephone has cute ring sounds etc. but doesn't function well.I can only dial calls if I put the Telephone number in first then turn on the phone. I I turn on the phone and proceed to dial anything the phone doesn't work. I tried to turn the dial feature from Tone to Pulse and that didn't help either.I have also owned Motorola Cell Phones and the Quality with them also stink. I guess Motorola just produces alot of junk....I wouldn't recommend anything made by this manufacturer
4,Amazing find,"Certain products that used to be found everywhere are getting harder to find, and this baby is one. It's a classic of engineering and has years of useful service, so of course they'll stop making it.I was thrilled to find this and the price was reasonable. It's a pressure relief valve on my solar water-heater and nobody in my Florida neighborhood carries it, so yahoo for Amazon."
4,Nice shirt,"Fast service. Nice shirt. A little stiff, but should mellow with age. Graphics are very nice, and look like they will last, unlike some."
2,dragon Tee,"The design is completely kick ass and I liked it, so did my boyfriend.. BUT it's too tight in the neck and a very long tee. So I'd say always go a size up in this one, as long as you don't mind it being long!"
5,Wonderful,"I was told the book was about a well-written story of life and human feelings. Well, it fitted the description perfectly. Besides, for those who had never heard of Cutting before, the sport was introduced in a way that makes the reader feels like looking for more about it."
2,A studio rush job,"Being a huge fan of Solti's complete Ring recording, I snapped this up when it first came out. I was never so disappointed in a Wagner record in all my life. The playing is shoddy, the interpretations lack luster and cold, The Ride of Valkyries seriously cut -- the whole thing smacked of a rush job. All in all the project struck me as Decca's figuring ""Wagner Ring excerpts + Vienna Philharmonic + Solti = instant $$$"" The recorded sound may be state-of-the-art, but as music making, it is seriously lacking heart. Szell's Wagner recordingsWagner: Orchestral Music from Der Ring des Nibelungen Die Meistersinger - Tristan und Isolde, whatever you might think of the CBS/Sony sound, are infinitely superior and make for much more rewarding listening."
2,Where's the rest of the music?,"I was disappointed by this CD. I expected the entire Ring cycle, and it's only selected music, the highlights. You could call this album a ""best of Wagner"" collection. Too bad, because sometimes Wagner's most compelling and lyrical music is the incidental stuff. If you like Solti and want only the bits & pieces, buy this CD. Otherwise, keep surfing, my friend."
3,OK but why Prix Goncourt?,"Most of the words in this book are devoted to descriptions of the appearance of neighborhoods, buildings and people. The next most common use of words is the description of actions. To me, the depiction of appearances and actions is best done by film and rather than by novels. I like novels because they can get into people's thoughts and emotions in a way films rarely do. This novel did little of that.This novel was occasionally clever or funny. But only occasionally.Was this really the best book of 1999 in France? I hope not."
2,wrong product delivered,"I ordered and paid for 2 SILVER speakers.Your agent CCV Sales delivered the cheaper BLACK SPEAKERS to my freight forwarding office. I don't want the black pBIC America Venturi DV64 2-Way Tower Speaker, Silver (Single)[[ASIuN:B00012F7DM BIC America Venturi DV64 2-Way Tower Speaker, Silver (Single)]]air. Please rectify the situation urgently.Until I receive the product I paid for , I'll give the product a token 2 rating."
5,the same as the DV-64,"Mr Horton is correct the bass is alittle on the shy side.Read the reviews on the DV-64. they are same speaker only in black. And if I read right this price is for a pair,you are getting avery good deal.Plus Bic America has avery good warranty."
3,"Good Bass, Great Clarity",I'd like to apologize to the good people at BIC for my previous review. I had these speakers down in my unfinished basement and couldn't hear much bass due to the size of the room. I've sinced moved them into the family room and love them!! The Bass is more than adequate for music and the clarity is fantastic for the price.
3,Place in the Storm,"The fantastic characters and funny dialogue set the pace for this overly long tale of strangers stranded by a storm in a small cafe. Small towns and the local cafe are favorites and this interesting assortment keeps you reading through the asides and repeats of thoughts with the irritating ""I told you this.""Bob, the dog is priceless and should make a second curtain call in another story. He has a better grip on reality than the strangers who meld in an elastic theme for two days until the storm passes.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,"Very well constructed, do not fit a wide foot","I tried Chaco's after many recommendations -- and here's the take for people with wide feet (EEE)....Chacos DO NOT FIT.Because of the extra long strap, the Chaco's flip flops do not fit a wide foot, and you need to order at least one size larger (I wear a size 7.5 EEE shoe -- the only Chaco's that seem to fit the bill were the size 9's).While the flip flop is a bit tight at first, it does loosen up a bit with wear -- but it also continues to bite into the top of one's wide foot leaving welts and, in my case, black and blue marks on the foot where the strap rides to the sides of the foot.But more disconcerting -- because of the now slightly too large flipflop front to back, your toes rub on the front underside, and this causes blisters on the large toes when walking any type of distance.Not at all recommended for a wide foot -- but probably great for a normal/thin foot."
4,Still the best flip flop but miss the Vibram sole,"Still the best Flip Flop due to arch support, comfort, strap and fit. The Grayskull strap has a hip apperance. Too bad Chaco decided to get rid of the Vibram sole in favor of the ""recycled"" EcoTread which I am sure was done to save $. The EcoTread does not offer the same grip and just feels of lower quality. We will have to see how the tread wear holds up."
5,Great shoe,"These flip flops are wonderful. I can tell that they will last long and still give me the support. I was worried about how comfortable they were going to be since they looked a bit thin in the picture, but they are soft enough to provide a bit of cushion but stiff enough to give great heel and arch support. I can even run in them, something rare in a thong sandal. If they ever wear out I'm definitely getting another pair."
5,Awesome!!!!,"My brother-In-Law got me into these shoes and bless him for it! These are the best flip flops I've ever owned. Totally worth the price! The quality is outstanding. They hurt a little the first day, but are fantastic now! I would recommend these to anyone looking for a quality flip flop! Lifetime warranty on a pair of flip flops is awesome. My brother-in-law has had a pair for 2 years and the thong started to come loose and they sent him a new pair in a few days. Awesome! Buy these flip flops!"
5,Chaco Slippers,"This is my second pair of Chacos. The soles support my arches in a way no other shoe, slipper or otherwise, does. What's more, the fit is tight so my toes don't have to grip the straps in order to stay on. This is, without question, the best slipper I've ever own. I should know. I live in Hawaii. :-)"
3,OK,"I was persuaded to give Chacos a try, and I like the design of this sandal. It gives good arch support and I like the feel of it under my feet. It took some time to break in, and they were very uncomfortable at first. But, mostly everything is fine now. The strap does give a little bit of an irritation above my big toes, but otherwise, I like them."
2,Defective? Fit too narrow,"Ordered these sandals online in size 9 and when I put them on, they didn't feel right. Too tight! I then bought a pair of size 8 at REI after trying them on and they fit perfectly. I believe the 9's were defective and the strap insertion sites were punched too close together in the sole. Poor quality control."
5,Very comfortable with solid support,"Most comfortable sandals I have ever owned. I have high arches in my feet and have been going through some pain as my feet get older. These were recommended to me and I will pass along the recommendation. They are sized a little small, I normally wear an 11.5, I bought these in a 12, and I should have gotten the 13."
4,Old classics,Love Cadillac! and all the other tunesSwedish band that made a couple of classic english hit songs!
4,A must for all who are engaged in store design!,"There are numerous books on store design, but only a few with real class. This is one of them. Otto Riewoldt shows us interior design jewels like the Herman Miller showroom in Chicago, the Swatch Timeship shop in New York, Alan Journo Shoes in Milan, shopping centers like Bluewater in London and the Munich Airport Center. Progressive design and foreward looking shop concepts that help selling even of today. - This book makes expensive and strenous trips seem unnessary and inspires our design creativity and commercial will power."
4,off the usual track,"I remember buying this CD as an import when it was first released, as usual there was no fanfare surrounding a new Gary Moore album and I was lucky to stumble upon it.This is a very different Album from Gary, I don't claim to know to much about him outside of his many recordings but there is deep emotion expressed here and the lyrics really seem to explore his inner self and his feeling of the time. There are strings, sequencers, various drum programmings and musical styles very out of the ordinary for this artist. It is a deep and engaging album, the track, Business As Usual really hits home. Gary is always changing in some way and this is another excellent step in his long and varied career."
1,Horrible DVD Transfer!!,"This movie transfer is horrible. It has distortions, horrible color, and is absolutely dark and dreary. Enjoying this movie was impossible. Save your money and do not purchase this company's dvd. Maybe there is another company out there with a better print."
2,the type of chargers,"the product was brand new and in perfect condition, but it did not support ipod structure"
3,"go ahead, its just fine","Great for the price--works just fine and is sturdy enough, but not high quality sexy gear."
3,Average,It gets the job done by putting the images from your ipod up onto the screen but the material is cheap and probably will be easily broken soon. but definitely a good buy compared to the competitors price.
3,Does not work with iPhone 3G,I may have misread the description when it said it works with 3G. It does not work with an iPhone 3G.
2,Apple iPod Charger 3 in 1 Bundled Kit - Home Travel Wall Charger - 12V Car Charger - AV Audio Video Cable,Good price and accesories except for a delivery delay and in the AV audio cable the video cable not work in my TV.
2,Not satisfied,I have not had a chance to use all the items in this kit but the car charger does not work and that was the main thing I needed
1,False advertising!!,"The product may work for people that have the older generation IPODs but just as another user mentioned the video cable WILL NOT work with the IPOD Classics and the chargers will always show battery fully charged the second they are plugged in, however the battery will not charge.May be a good product for other IPODs but do not buy if you have a Classic!!!"
2,You get what you paid for.,"When I plug in the charger for my IPOD, my IPOD shows Fully Charged! but I know theres no way it charge in an instant. The video cables do not work on the Classic IPODs. I haven't tried the car charger yet, but chances are its gonna show FULL CHARGED the moment I plug in my IPOD. So the bottom line is, you get what you paid for."
2,Compatibility wanting!,"WATCH OUT, this comes with a video cable that it is NOT COMPATIBLE with ANY of the current generation iPods! This is revealed in the description page, but halfway down amid a lot of clutter - - in my opinion should be labeled as such in the product description. The company was nice to refund my money but not shipping charges (either way) which ended up about 1/3 of the total."
2,AV Cable didn't work,I bought this mainly for the audio video cable and it didn't work. I got sound from the unit but no video. The other cables might work I have not used them yet because I generaly charge my ipod through a FM transmitter. I did like the screen protector that came with the kit.
3,Unsure,"It's been working ok now, but after the first time I used it, my iPod would only play tunes by one particular artist and would skip over all the others in the shuffle. It wouldn't play anything else even if I selected it manually. I let the battery completely run down and then charged it again on my computer. It's working fine now and I use the car charger for short periods of time now. I haven't had any further problems."
1,cushions fall off,"These earbuds are awful. I purchased them after my Koss ""Plug"" earbuds finally broke. The package contains three different sized cushions from which to choose. Only the smallest size fit my ears. Every time I used them, the cushions fell off. Today at the gym one of the cushions fell off again... inside my ear. I am throwing these out and buying another pair of Koss Plugs."
2,It was a great show but this is by no means a great book.,"The plan was to convey to American audiences a 'behind the scenes' look at ITV's accidental hit. However in addition to the many informative facts the author has included so much syrupy praise, that I was just about ready to go into insulin shock as I finished.While the idea was good and it was nice to find out some of the fact not available back in the pre-internet days, I would have to say that even for a die-hard 'up-down' fan like myself this book was way too 'over the top'"
4,Not really about Galileo,"This book isn't really about Galileo. It's not about his work, or his discoveries. It's not about the changes he made in our understanding of the world.It's a book about a small child trying to be part of her daddy's life. You know any kids like that, poking around your desk, playing with your things and trying to understand your grown-up business?I was taken a little by surprise at how simple the language used is. With its short sentences, this book is more appropriate for 4 year olds than 8 year olds, as I had imagined. Don't expect to use this book to teach your kid science or history, but it's a good book to describe... wonderment, I suppose, which a scientist has to have as much as a child."
5,The best in IDM,"I can't believe this guy doesn't receive the accolades he deserves. His music is so inspiring.. beautiful. Let's just say that Aphex Twin (Richard D. James) was the pioneer, and Clark is the perfectionist.Any true fan of IDM will absolutely fall in love with his work (post Clarence Park). I'm not Saying Clarence Park is bad, because it's not. When I first heard CP, I thought it was a cute little album, but didn't really expect too much from Chris going forward.. then I heard ""Empty The Bones Of You"", which completely obliterated my soul.Boddy Riddle is a really nice follow-up album to ETBOY, however it doesn't quite measure up in my opinion. It doesn't flow like the former album does. That's really unfair, however, because I believe ETBOY is true perfection.All I can say is that I hope Chris either never retires, or is cloned in his sleep. If he stops making music, I fear I will become deaf."
4,Classics!,"This is a great collection of hits from Perfecto Records. I remember most of all of these hits dating all the way back to the early 90's like Human Nature by Gary Clail. All of the the tracks are top notch and well worth owning if at all you knew what electronic and dance music was like in that decade when this music exploded. Tracks like Grace's Not Over Yet, Tilt's Rendezvous [Tilt's Quadraphonic Instrumental Mix], Reach Up by Perfecto Allsarz or Someone Like You by Ascension. This collection has all of the great hits from the decade when electronica and dance music exploded!SJwww.bestplaylists.com"
4,Dr. S's slingback,"Love these shoes, 2nd pair i've purchased as broke 1st. they are not super comfortable, but there's a trade off b/c they're hot."
4,The Meeting Room,"Jericka is a well read, educated, peaceful and religious manager. She works for Human Services. The needs of the families hold a special place in her heart, but not only at work in her personal life as well. She is now working with a new crew of social workers and she believes that she's hired a good group, or has she?Megan desperately needs accolades.Phoenix whines and is genuinely unhappy.Patches is a recognized ladies man who is educated and hardworking.Denver suffers from mommy issues.Jericka finds a way to justify so no one suffers.Usually a good judge of character, Jericka is caught with an open door and is uncertain how to handle the fact that someone is trying to interfere with everything that she's worked hard for.I liked ""Backroom Confessions"" and consider it recommended reading."
1,I want my money back!,"I started reading this and had to stop. By page three there was already a place where a phone call starts, but there are no indicators.Then this 'backroom' line is ridiculous. This woman is a supervisor, and she allows a conversation about sex with a chicken go on? You have to be kidding me.I was annoyed from the start. This was sold to me as literary fiction and it was garbage. If I have a chance, I will burn this book and dance around it's ashes. If I believed in banning book, this one should be banned because it's horrible."
5,A very great book,"I haven't enjoyed reading a novel as much as The Ha-Ha in many years. Because of the buzz it created, I went in with high expectations and it exceeded them. Howie's narration, Wow, especially the giddy descriptions of what's doing as if the whole world's signing back to him. King turns the introversion of language into an advantage and pulls off a big emotional impact. As a debut novelist he shows incredible range and depth. The depiction of the antagonist Sylvia is more than a dead-on uncompromising portrait of an addict. There are traces of Sylvia everywhere in our culture and she should live on as a great literary character. After the powerful first and second sections of the novel, the third, improabably, miraculously, raises the bar of great writing even further. My suggestion: don't read the plot summaries, just get a copy and dive in."
4,Nice first novel,I thought this was a unique story of finding one's life in spite of hardship.Howard is likeable and a bit scary at the same time.
5,Support the returning veterans,"I liked the characters in this book and strongly related to them. I cheered their successes and ached for their failures, especially of course Howard. Read this book and be aware that there may be a long read to recovery ahead for the returning soldiers from Iraq. Give them space, give them understanding, be kind, and love them enough to unlock some of those locked doors."
2,Fatherhood frustrated,"The protagonist, Howie, is a Vietnam vet, deprived of the power of speech for the past thirty years. He agrees to take on the nine-year-old son of an old girlfriend while the mother goes into rehab, and the two-month experience of parenting changes his life, opening him to strengths he had not known, and making him more appreciative of the circle of people he already has around him. That occupies the first two thirds of the book. But then the author takes some unexpected turns (as he says with pride in the reader's guide interview), perhaps wanting to avoid too easy or sentimental an ending. I am not sure that the ending when it comes is any less sentimental -- it is just a lot more difficult to follow the character through to that point. While the internal monologue is indeed expertly handled, the storytelling is so slow that the eight weeks seem at times more like two years."
3,Dave King's HA HA,"The novel is engrossing and finally moving. He writes with a very clear and sometimes beautiful prose style. However, I never was fully convinced by the narrative voice of the central character and this kept me from fully surrendering to the book."
3,"good premise, flawed structure","This book deserves praise for its interesting premise, and a central character who is unique in fiction. The author does a good job developing Howard as a sympathetic character leading a life of relative solitude because of his limited ability to communicate. We want him to succeed in his effort to better engage with the people around him, especially 9-year Ryan who rekindles his ability to love.The book fails in the disjointed middle portion. Howard suffers a frightening mental break that culminates in a brutal act of violence. The author introduces a serious question whether Howard is a danger to himself and others, but fails to develop this plot point at all, more or less setting it aside to wield the story toward a tepid ending, completely disjointed from the violent middle.I listened to this book on audio CD narrated by Terry Kinney, who does a fine job conveying Howard as a sympathetic character who we want to succeed."
4,Ha Ha by Dave King,Great Book--for once I was unable to figure out how the story would end--and it was very well done.
2,Exposition Overload,"This book never grabbed a hold of me. It's premise is a good one, but the writing style of exposition only bogged me down and forced me to skim a lot in the middle. I didn't miss a thing.I think this book suffers from trying too hard to be meaningful, and so instead of being meaningful and engaging, it just grinds. This would have been a much much better book if we were shown the interesting beginning part of Howard's recovery, instead of only recieving hints and glimpses from where he now stands, embittered."
3,"Good idea for a story, however too slow in pace","When I read the summary of the book on the inside cover it captured my attention. I'm not going to explain it here because many other reviews already have. While the story idea is great, I found the writing style and pace of the book far too slow. It was bogged down but inconsequential descriptions of random things that did not add any dimension to the story line. After a little more than halfway through the book (I was still giving it a chance, hoping it would pick up) I just could not keep reading page after page and flipped to the last couple pages just to get to the ending and sadly, like someone else has mentioned, I don't think I missed much by doing that. I've almost never done that with a book I decided to read for fun and that was quite disappointing. I don't discourage anyone from reading it, as this book has received many 4's and 5's, but it just didn't capture my attention like I expect books to do."
5,La sua música è bellisima!!!,"When I first heard Andrea Bocelli, I thought opera, and I didn't give him a chance. However, I recently heard one of the songs on this CD. Vivo Per Lei is absolutely the most beautiful and powerful song I have ever heard in my life. For that song and Con Te Partirò, I bought the CD, and after listening to the entire CD, I was very impressed. What BEAUTIFUL music! Andrea Bocelli takes me away. ""Vivo per lei perche me fa vibrare forte l'anima, vivo per lei e non è un peso."" [In reference to music] I live for her because she makes my soul vibrate strongly, I live for her, and it's not a weight [burden]."" Listen to this amazing CD, hear those words and you can see for yourself how passioned Andrea is about his music. I'm just learning Italian, but possi dire che la sua música è di il suo cuore! (His music is from his heart.) Buy this CD, you may be surprised and at the very least, spiritually moved!!! = )"
5,A new fan from New York,"There was a record store inside the subway station in New York and I used to hear the song Con Te Partiro and Time to Say Goodbye (with Sarah Brightman) being played all the time while I was catching the train to my job. Even though I was too much in a hurry to pay attention to the song at first, eventually it caught on each time I commute to work and hear the song being played. I heard the song again while skating at the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink. When I was passing the store in the subway once again, instead of rushing to the train, I ran into the store to ask to sales person who is the performer. He showed me the CD Romanza by Andrea Bocelli. The man has such a wonderful voice. The more I know about Mr. Bocelli, the more graceful and lovable he appears."
5,Amazing!!!,"I bought this cd again after losing my original copy that I bought the year it was released. Out of all my Bocelli cds this is my favorite. It has a good mix of classic opera with popera and really shows his abilities. I have used this cd to turn people on to opera and popera, and the results have been incredible! Once you hear him, you cannot deny his talent and passion. Simply AMAZING!!!"
5,Romanza,Romanza is a wonderful escape from stress. I listen to it often while driving... it helps me not care if I am sitting in traffic. It is also great for relaxing at home... Romanza gives me that warm fuzzy feeling.
3,A Bocelli smorgasbord.,This is a pleasing background music offering from Bocelli. Many well known and often presented items from youtube. Would like a disc which shows the classical side of his work. Worth having. KB
1,Great Start & End - Bad Middle,"The first and last songs are incredibly beautiful and moving and nearly worth the price. However, the euro-pop fluff in between is very difficult to listen to. He has such an incredible voice and it is completely wasted on these selections. Bocelli's ""Sacred Arias"" is a much better buy."
3,Pop singer of operatic arias,"I don't think anyone could really say Bocelli is an operatic singer, but what he does is nice and very appealing for the non-operatic ear. Over- extends himself at times. He is hardly in the same league as the other great ""cross-overs"", Domingo/Carreras/Pavarotti."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,My best friend played this at her dinner party last night. I had never heard it before and completely fell in love with his voice. This will be the next CD I'll buy adding to an already eclectic music collection.
5,What a voice!,"When I first heard his voice at a wedding ceromony everybody was stunned to hear such a wonderful voice. I specially like ""Vivo Per Lei"", I think Giorgia does a fabolous job also. Bocelli puts emotion into music in a way I have never heard before!"
5,"Phenomenal, takes you to another world","This album makes you realize how wonderful life really is, and how fortunate you are to have the taste to appreciate it. If you want to really fall in love with life, get ""Todos Los Romances"" by Luis Miguel, ""Alone, But Never Alone"" by Larry Carlton, ""Secret Story"" by Pat Metheny and ""With My Lover Beside Me"" by Nancy Wilson. If you really appreciate melodic, meaningful and gorgeous music, you'll love all of them."
5,OUTSTANDING MUSIC - POWERFUL,"I heard this CD last year on a student exchange in France of all places. Being as populer as it is I read the words which traslate beutifly. I Love the powerfulness it has, especially 'Vivere' and 'Vivo Per Lei', which have strong musical lines along with The Best Duets. I can't reccomend this entire cd enough, and to everyone, adults and students (like my self) alike. Buy and Feel the Great Power Andrea Bocelli can Whim."
3,A talent to look out for,"Try not to be intimidated by the legions of Bocelli worshipers, who thank he is an angel from God, or some such. His voice and range are remarkable, and most of the songs on this album are good with ""Con Te Partiro"" and ""Romanza"" being standouts. However, he is a new artist with much to learn, and I am excited by the possibilites. I heartily recommend Bocelli's ""The Opera Album"", which I feel is his best recording to date."
5,A voice from heaven!,"Bocelli will make you fall in love....with Italy, with him, with his voice, with life, with love itself!! A voice with a sound so pure you can never get enough of it."
5,Goosebumps...,Every time... and I have heard it many times... but he always gives me goosebumps. In Miserere his voice absolutely SOARS... I bought this CD because I saw he and Sarah Brightman perform Con Te Partiro on a video at the mall... my jaw hung for the duration of the song and I knew I had to hear more from him... the other songs do not disappoint. Though some may say he lacks technical ability he more than makes up for it with sheer BEAUTY. This CD is simply phenomenal.
4,Agreed: Pop not Opera,"I purchased this CD and, from an operatic point of view, was disappointed. Bocelli doesn't hit all the notes. He's flat sometimes, sure. But we are not talking about Verdi here. THIS IS POP MUSIC. Comparing Bocelli to any of the 3 tenors is like comparing Sinatra to Bing Crosby. Sometimes Frank didn't sing all the notes on the page (and Bing always did) But Frank had his own style. Well Andrea sometimes doesn't get it all right, but what he does get right is...well...sometimes sublime (well as far as Con Te Partiro is concerned). The rest of the album is Italian Pop Pap. Nothing more or less. Also, I thought it was funny that Sarah Brightman was jumping on the Bocelli train. SO, should you buy this album? Sure. Andrea Bocelli is pretty good. Some of his songs are pretty good. As long as you are not expecting ""AIDA"" you'll be happy with it."
5,"Proud to ""jump"" on this particular ""bandwagon""!","Yep. I saw the concert on PBS. I looked for, found, and bought the album. Never heard of the man before (although i had heard part of Con Te Partiro on a car comercial - what an odd way to discover such brilliance!) but now i've found more of his work. Brilliance. I understand only about 8% of the Italian words, but i don't care.Lyrics are important to me, so i have to praise the inclusion of the Italian and English translations! Not sure how accurate they are, but they add to my enjoyment.Bravo."
5,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am very moved by Andrea's voice..I loved every cut on Romanza..bought his arias also..am looking for his sacred music cd..I want more, more, more..I am generally one solid goose bump when listening to him..God Bless You Mr. Boccelli..Long life to you!!!!Thank you, Thank you....."
5,The best cd ever.,"I loved the cd and the dvd ""A Night in Tuscany"". Co-workers also loved both. He is definetly worth listening to and has such as versatile voice."
4,Classic,"this album is what many believe started it all for Andrea here in the States, though it is not his first album by far. It has his masterpiece ballad, Con Te Partiro, and that alone makes this album worth purchasing! A must have for your Bocelli collection!"
3,An Italianized Englishman...,"Is the Devil incarnate."" (Inglese italianato e un diavolo incarnate) Or so I've heard. I suppose the author (I read it in a copy of Machiavelli's The Prince) could be forgiven for not having heard Don Bocelli and Donna Brightman sing ""Con Te Partiro"" - can we now say Inglese italianata e un angelo incarnate?The rest of the album is a collection of ballads, most of which suffer from weak or clashing instrumentals. An exception is ""Macchine Da Guerra"" which has a pleasant and comparatively strong piano accompaniment.I'd like to thank Kenny McCormick of South Park, CO for turning me on to Don Bocelli."
3,Romanza for romantic moments,it's quite long ago since this CD came on the market. I never liked it much but as a gift for an Andrea Bocelli freak (who never hear this album) I thought it would be an interesting sound experience. Unfortunately it wasn't. The newer albums of Bocelli seems to be more beloved ...
1,TSK TSK TSK...,"have you guyz ever heard of an awesome rock band called TOOL? you should check them out, the actually create some real music and maynard has a hell of a lot better voice than this fruit."
3,Easy listening.,"Like most, I purchased this CD after growing to love the incredible duet with Sarah Brightman, ""Time to say Goodbye"". It is an incredibly moving piece of music and this CD plays two different versions of the famous track. The less famous Italian version is just as special as the English edition. Does the rest of the album live up to this musical masterpiece? Unfortunately, no.Romanza is easy on the ear and there is no doubting Bocelli is a gifted vocalist. However, he doesn't share the same range as most Opera singers. In fact, the album attempts to cross the pop/opera barrier but only comes across as awkward in this regard.It's not great opera, it's not great pop but it's good easy listening music."
5,Bravo Bravo Bravo,"Do I seem excited? I feel excited! After being overwhelmed by ""Sogno""...I dreamt of everything Italian and decided to buy this earlier release by the sensitively powerful Andrea Bocelli. On ""Romanza"" we are again treated to non-traditonal, yet, exquisite operatic music. Melodies and lyrics of the sort that make ones heart soar. Even people who do not like opera, like Bocelli.The first thing I did after bringing this treasure home, was fill the tub with steamy water and bubbles, light some candles, poured a large glass of crisp white wine and indulged in an afternoon of utter decadence.Mesmerizing mixtures of Italian, French, and Spanish influences within these tracks had me in a fantasyland of adornment. I found the duets delightful....but when the water turned as cold as the wine, it was, well, ""Time To Say Good-Bye"".A suberb CD in every way. Listen and become enchanted.*Grazi* for your interest & comments--CDS"
5,Perfection,"Andrea Bocelli's voice is quite an enigma. He keeps the equipoise between his operatic yet pop voice in such a subtle manner it is almost worthy of a whole new genre of its own.Con te Partiro is the perfect example of this. The emotion in the song is so solid you could cut it with a knife. People say he has a thin voice and could not sing over an orchestra. I disagree. HE could easily sing over the loudest orchestra without any amplification. But less is more, and that is what he does. He draws you in, with his ability to sing high notes pianissimo as well as forte, the former the greater feat.Great album.Absolute magic."
5,Romanza,I have been an Andrea Bocelli fan for about 2 yrs. Romanza is one of my favorites. No one sings these love songs as beautifully as Andrea. If you have Sogno you will love this album.
5,"Song from ""the Sopranos""","I've seen Andrea Bocelli sing during televised concerts and have always admired his voice, but I did not know of his specific works. While watching ""the Sopranos"" (HBO series), I heard a beautiful song I couldn't get out of my mind...while checking closed captioning, it credited Andrea Bocelli. Immediately, I came to Amazon.com to find out the name of the song (""Con Te Partiro"") and album (Romanza) this song was from. Bought it immediately and love it!"
1,Please...,"Please listen to the other tenors. It is the hype that drove people to Andrea Bocelli and that is it. Go listen to a recording of Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Cura etc and hear how real tenor and PROPER singing can do for you; if even Andrea Bocelli can."
1,there is more legato in a snare drum than in this voice,"I am a singer studying opera, so I buy about every CD I can get my hands on to study, and to listen to. I found absolutely nothing remarkable about this voice, and there was no real singing. People that think this is good should check out jusi bjerling or Alfredo Kraus, so they can hear a real tenor actually shape a phrase."
3,Unmet potential,"I am a big fan of Andrea, however, this CD shows me where he might have gotten started on his reputation for a ""weak voice."" I don't believe he has a weak voice, but in this case he does not rise to his full potential. After listening to his album ""Sogno"" in which he is nothing less than fabulous, this was a bit of a letdown due to the pop singing; at times sounding like an Italian version of Tom Jones. My recommendation: buy ""Sogno"" instead."
5,Best Entertainment,"One word to describe this album - SUPERB Andrea Bocelli possesses a classic tenor voice He created a wonderful album made of light music yet strong,deep, calming ,touches you deep inside , sweeping you into sea of emotions...This cd is a Must!"
3,Acceptable,"This is a used CD, which was definitely stated. However, there is static on it that sounds like loud cracking noises when it is being played. There were also some cracks in the case. But for the price, not a bad purchase."
2,Very disappointing,"I've seen the PBS specials and heard Con Te Partiro, so I was really looking forward to hearing the entire CD. I found it very disappointing. The scores were not blended well and were WAY too synthesized and electric. When Bocelli's voice is good it is very good, but too much of the music on this CD does not capitalize on his voice - the music is almost ""pop""."
2,Pure Pop for Now People?,"My wife just came back from Bellagio with a complimentary copy of this album. Put it on, and first enjoyed the now-too-familiar but still beautiful Con Te Partiro, but the album rapidly went downhill from there, with Bocelli's lightweight, overachieving vocal style being overwhelmed and oversweetened by the schmaltzy pop synthesized arrangements. It got so cloying that we had to turn it off by the sixth cut. His voice has undeniable charm, but this production does it an injustice by pandering too much to Top 40 taste. And despite the other critics here who favorably compare Bocelli to Pavarotti, Domingo, et al, just listen to any given aria performed by these classically trained masters, say something familiar like Che Gelida Manina from La Boheme, alongside a Bocelli version, and you'll hear Bocelli's limitations."
1,A Night at the Popera,"Should you buy this CD? Depends. Do you want to listen to involving, emotional, full-blown opera? If so, don't buy this thin imitation. Do you want something you can put on in the background and ignore while you cook spaghetti? Great! Buy it! For the rest of you, I prescribe the Mirella Freni/Pavarotti version of ""Boheme."" Talk about your knee-wobbling aphrodesiacs!"
5,Magnificent,I have never before been moved by any artist's voice. Bocelli is fabulous. I can't get enough of him.
5,Fan in St. Louis Missouri,I had not heard of Andrea Bocelli till about a month ago. The first CD I got was Romanza and I fell in love with his voice! My favorite is Vivo Per Lei. I've listened to it so much that I can now sing along. I hope he comes to St. Louis some day so I can hear him in person!
3,Con Te Partiro is the only reason to buy this CD...,"Con Te Partiro is haunting and beautiful. Time to Say Goodbye with Sarah Brightman is good also. That's it though. The rest of the CD is filler.Romanza is worth buying for it's two great tracks, but don't expect anything more. Some of the glowing reviews of it are just over the top."
5,"All you ""one star creditors"" eat a nut!","I acquired this album when it came out in Europe. It's freakin' money. The guy has a real smoothe controlled voice. That is the final verdict. Buy it now and if you can the DVD ""Live in Tuscany."""
5,It stopped me dead in my tracks in the New York City subway.,"We first heard the song Con Te Partiro on the Bellagio commercial. I heard it again commuting on the subway in Manhattan and bought the CD on the spot. When we heard the song in its entirety, we both burst into tears. It is so moving. I lived in Italy for a year and the CD reminded me of my wonderful time there. Bocelli's voice is beautiful and the songs fill your heart and soul with passionate emotion."
5,"A must see, A must buy....","Gotta love the old movies, especially with Bob Hope. They do not make movies like they used to. Gotta see this one."
4,Alias Jesse James,The video was recived in a timely manner and was in great condition. Very pleased.
3,Margaret Price is wonderful,"Margaret Price has a glorious voice, and she sings with wonderfully flowing line. She is easily the main reason for acquiring this set, though I find Renato Bruson immensely satisfying too with a burnished tone and an equally seamless legato. But; but, Solti does seem to want to hog all the attention and as a previous reviewer has said, his Verdi was always controversial because he often imported his schooling from other idioms traditions, and whether the result was successful or not depends largely on taste. I think he's much better in his earlier set. And Pavarotti I find disappointing here. But Price, oh Price; she's wonderful."
2,Over-hyped? Or just plain ordinary?,"A disappointing set. Margaret Price is interesting, with a wonderful voice that just doesn't quite have the necessary soaring quality (her top C's generate a slight wince in the listener) but apart from her only Bruson makes a mark amongst the principals. Pavarotti is loud and uningratiating - far better on the earlier Bartoletti set - and seems to have been recorded miles from everybody else. Bergonzi (on each of his two sets) remains Pavarotti's better. Solti, too, seems to me stronger in the 1962 set. His Verdi was always controversial (the polite way of saying unreliable) and too much volume on this set and you'll be worrying about the neighbours."
5,Worked well,On our trip it was easy to wash and dry the socks and the underwear we bought as well. All worked as expected.
2,not what I expected,Hi--the product was fine except that the company said it came with a doctor's lab coat and it did not. I emailed the company right away and did not hear back for over two weeks. In the email back to me it said they would send me a special number or code (or something) so I could send it back and I never heard back again. I will NEVER do business with this company nagain. I ended up ordering the lab coat from another company for an additional $16 or something....UGH!
3,cheaply made,"This is not a product than can be washed and used multiple times. I bought it to add to my daughters dress-up trunk. She loves the costume, but I do not think it will hold up for very long. The sizing was appropriate for her (4T) with a little grow room."
2,Kids' scrubs,Not good quality at all. Not what I was expecting in terms of material. However my child likes dressing up like daddy so he thought it was fun.
2,does your dog need a hat?,"shirt and pants were ok, but very flimsy material. the mask is fine but hat might fit a 6 month old? ridiculously tiny."
2,Typical Karajan,"The singing has its meritous moments , even quite good actaully, the chorus excellent.It 's Karajan with his usual flubbing on the podium, HvK maks slips as to when the orch should enter the right time for the csating...the singers are always trying to figure out what hvK is up to next...., he often stretches phrases, more often guilty of bashing and banging certain cressendos, just too akward for my taste, You might like it, who knows, read the above stunning reviews for all the hype you want.. For me its Gergiev by a significant margin that wins the day."
4,Good system overall,"I bought this system a month ago. I would have to say that it's simplicity is amazing, it's sleek and the speaker size is just right. Though, there's a downside:High frequencies are barely heard. I installed 5 surface mount tweeters beside each cube, and the sound improvement was very noticeable. I strongly recommend to anyone that owns this model to do the same, these tweeters are not expensive, and the upgrade is worth the effort.All the system's other features are very user friendly. Also it has a zoom power (x1.5) that allows you to see widescreen bigger, as though you are watching full screen.For the frequency response is that I give the system a strong 4 stars."
1,Amazon - help your users!,"My rating has nothing to do with this book, but about trying to figure out why this edition (Nov 2003) was so much more expensive than the earlier edition (Oct 2003). I had to use the ISBN and research other websites and believe I figured it out - the Nov edition (ISBN 0471472409) includes a CD ROM, but the October edition (ISBN 0471453927) is only the book. Without the table of contents or more descriptive editorial review, it took me way too long to figure this out! I hope this review helps others."
1,Bubble Boy - not what you thought,"I agree that there should be two soundtracks, the first one being the compilation of great singles from this great movie, the second being the origional score. DO NOT BUY THIS CD if you are looking for the songs off the movie. It is only the instrumental score."
1,the instrumental,"This CD is really dissapointing. I bought it, thinking it would have the songs from the movie on, for example, Blink 182 and Jude. IT DOESN'T. Trust me on this one kids......DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,eh,"i agree, i would have liked a soundtrack with the actual songs in bubble boy, since they were AWESOME, but i think the score is good too! cows and ice cream and the clouds/riding with push pop are my favorites! why does everyone hate it? it's good! not as good as the movie, but it deserves atleast 3 stars."
1,Bubble Boy Soundtrack Major Disappointment,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this product. I was looking for the actual soundtrack and was very disappointed to find out it was musical instruments only. I dont recall reading that in the description of the product. My understanding was it was the actual soundtrack and I was very excited. Lessons learned, things arent always what they seem. Beware before purchasing."
1,what song,"what song is Blink-182 playing when bubble boy runs out of the house in his bubble suit and he says ""grass? lamppost? DOG POO?! this is awesome!!!"""
5,sermons for living,"This is a wonderful little book, full of elegance and grace while addressing important life issues. Very readable. I have purchased several copies as gifts."
5,Special message,"This book has a very special message that children need to hear.During a child's formative years they need to hear from all directions, that they are loved.This book is a very special gift."
1,the burning times,"This was my first encounter also with this author and it will be the last.I have to agree with the Publishers Weekly Review that it contains ""overwrought dream sequences and one dimensional characters"". I was hoping for historical fiction along the lines of The Popes Daughter and Death of a Medici Princess by Caroline Murphy. This book was more like a Danielle Steel fantasy."
3,Definitely Odd,"This novel was exceptionally odd. It was my first encounter with this author and I was hopeful about the prospect of this book. Instead of what I expected, a more traditional novel about the persecution of ""witches"" in the Middle Ages, this book took a turn towards the weird. Marie Francoise, an abbess accused of witchcraft relates her life story to Father Michel, a very young Catholic priest. Through the telling of her tale, Michel comes to see that he is entwined with Marie, and that he is actually a supernatural figure, not a mere priest.It was absolutely interesting to read, but was extremely odd."
1,Poor treatment of fascinating subject,"This is a shallow and stereotyped story. The characters are poorly developed. From the first chapter you know what the ""surprise"" at the end will be. It is a teeny-bopper witch tale. For good treatments of Wicca I would prefer to read anything by Starhawk. For a real historical treatment of the subject of the witch trials, Highroad to the Stake by M Kunze is definitely far superior. This particular book was a waste of my time, an insult to my intelligence...and boring!"
3,A good read,"This book starts out quite boring. I even parted with reading it for some time but when forced to read something I picked it back up again and believe it or not, it gets better. I would have to say that the boredom ceased once Sybille went off on her own. So hang in there and enjoy."
2,A missed opportunity,"I was hoping to read a historical novel on the inquisition, but it is just a vague and overambitious attempt to embrace too many subjects (battles, pestilences, monastic life, paganism, inquisition, magic etc.). The flow of the narration is continuosly interrupted by dreams and flash-backs and the ""final surprise"" can be guessed almost at the beginning of the book for you know from the start the real nature of certain characters. The idea was good, but this book is definitely a missed opportunity. The author seems only too eager to imitate the more mature and complex narrative by Marion Zimmer Bradley."
3,"Great story, but...","...a meandering narrative with highly confusing dream sequences and flashbacks. While Kalogridis gives us excellent visuals and brilliant plotlines, the 'flowus interruptis' is distracting and annoying. Reads like it's trying to be a gothic horror story told in the style of a Harlequin Romance, and not succeeding very well at either. I'd recommend finding another book to read!"
3,my review,"At first I thought the book would be about the story of a person fleeing the inquisition in France in the mid 1400's. Many totally innocent people were accused and burned during those times, but I was not ready to find the story of cult followers to ""the goddess"" and their fight against the enemy.Even though the story is interesting and the plot holds till the end of the book, it sometimes felt too mystical and surreal. You don't know whether to take this book as a faithfull recount of those times and situations or as a fantasy set in historical times.However, the book is entertaining and well written. All characters are alive and interesting and the places and situations are very well described."
4,A Good Read,"When I was younger I read this book about half-way and put it aside, not to pick it up again until years later. I read it cover to cover this time, and was satisfied with it. Yes, there are gaps in the middle, like with Luc's story, which confused me and turned me off in a way, but, everything comes together in the end. True identities are revealed and the story finally makes sense, bringing together the long separated lovers, and giving you an ending you were hoping for. It is a book like this that makes me question the establishments of religion and churches, and whether they are truly good, or just bring as much or even more evil than it should. This story gives you a taste of what the church did to men and women (most of them innocent) suspected of witchcraft. It makes you sick to your stomach at the corruption that went on then, and even happens today, involving priest and innocent victims in their hands. A good read overall. Though I wish it would have been a little longer."
4,Purely Beyond Erasure,"It is just so amazing when you look at so many artists that really don't sound great these days, when the image alone is what sells. That remains unfortunate because those songs don't have any feeling. Unlike most manufactured acts, Erasure really became as a surprise to me. Their recent single, Breathe is a unbelieveable surprise. The songs has more meaning than Britney Spears has in love. The song is very upbeat and beautiful, where its video is very sad at times, upon a homeless girl who just tries to stay warm. I really don't think a lot of people actually are going to enjoy this song, but it is just a great change for anybody who is interested for what is hot. Breathe by Erasure is better than hot.Song: B+"
4,Berlitz Kids Spanish Picture Dictionary,"This is a great picture dictionary for kids. I got it to help teach my boys (5 and 7) some conversational Spanish, and this book makes it fun. It's mostly alphabetical, by English words, but the best part is the ""themed"" pages on animals, clothing, ""a family dinner"" and meeting and greeting. My only complaint is that the dictionary doesn't include pronunciations, which would help anyone unfamiliar with Spanish."
5,"Not for traditionalists, but great music from Lebanon","Toufic Farroukh knows no boundaries. He just makes compelling music. Several of his compositions have snagged my ears on Putumayo compilations over the years. So much so that I finally took the plunge and bought his CDs. Cuts like ""Land of Milk and Money"", ""Pain in Spain Stays Mainly in the Brain"" and ""Fusic"" just grab my attention and won't let go. Simply great music."
4,almost a 5 star,"i only have had this tv for a week and i would of given it 5 stars if for not for a few things that might or might not be a problem- all the channels come in like its hdtv clear but channel 8 an 10, it has strong scan lines in the dark black areas, it could be the antenna or a overloaded signal from the broadcasters themselfs. directv comes in like you are watching hdtv so does dvds played with component cables. the sound is only ok but i dont care i got external speakers hooked up to the set and now it sounds great-love the bass and treble controls also- but my biggest concern is that it makes a very loud click when you turn it on, so i am going to call rca to find out if that is normal. if it is just a loud power supply turning on and its not a problem then i would give this tv a 5 star rating---"
3,Lots of great info!,"Both of these books give you a wealth of information about what to expect both before and after your baby is born. The problem I have with them is that they are set up in a Q&A format. Some unnamed parent writes in with a question about their baby and the authors answer. Though this does cover many important topics, I was hoping for something more direct. For example, when I was wondering what the signs of teething were, I had to consult the index, which directed me to several sections that mentioned teething, but didn't spell out the information I was looking for. I found this to be a problem mostly in What to Expect the First Year. I didn't really have any complaints about What to Expect When You're Expecting. It's definitely one of, if not THE, best book out there about pregnancy. Buy it. Just don't get this boxed set. For information on you baby's first year, I'd recommend a different parenting book such as The Baby Book by Dr. Sears."
1,NOT IMPRESSED BY THE INFORMATION,"I just had my first baby two months ago. My mother lives in another country, I have no sisters and nobody to talk to about being pregnant, giving birth or raising kids. Because of this, I was forced to go out and buy many books on the subject of motherhood. This book was not what I was looking for. The book does not cover certain topics about pregnancy or delivery in depth, I thought the book left alot of useful information out. I didn't think alot of the information was up to date and I was not impressed by any of it. Feeling desperate and not knowing what to expect, I turned to other books, which I really learned alot from. I will not recommend this book to anyone, but I will say that the following books educated me and were very useful, educational and inspirational to a new mom like me. The books I read and do recommend are:1. The ABC's of prenatal Diagnosis. 2. 1000 Questions about your pregnancy. 3. 101 essential tips: childbirth."
1,Did not like condescending tone,I cannot recommend these books partly because of the condescending tone and partly because of the information within - some of which I find to be even harmful or compromise bonding between mother and child. There are many other books on the market - Sears for example - that have much more accurate and reliable information.
2,Bad Breastfeeding Info,"These books do contain a lot of good information, but they have quite a bit of Blatantly Incorrect information and advice regarding breastfeeding. They even go so far as to lie about doctor and pediatrician recommendations."
3,Check out the real thing before you buy from a picture!,"I ordered the 3219WW Leaather Case for my LifeDrive based on the picture that I saw of it. That was my mistake. I previously used a Tungsten E2 and the leather case that came with it actually included space not only for flash cards but for business cards and money as well. I assumed that the leather case for the LifeDrive would have the same capabilities. Basically, you can only fit a couple of extra memory cards in the slots available. The case is attractive and it does protect my LifeDrive, I just miss having the features of my old case."
3,leather case for life drive,I didn`t like the outer look of the case.I thought it looked old.I like the magnetic clasp it has.It is serving its purpose and its quite easy to open so overall it wasn`t a bad buy.
4,Needs improvement,The inside or the leather case is finished in black velvet! this is not the optimus material for the use and the look of the item. I recomend just leather.
3,"Fine case, no real issues","The case is a good deal at the Amazon price point, not the Palm MSRP. The case provides space for my business cards and two SD cards, which is all I need. It is a nice-looking case that doesn't add much bulk to the already-bulky LifeDrive.Only complaints I have are that the case is smelly of horsey leather right out of the box (smell faded completely after a few days), and the suede-ish interior has a tendency to lint up the screen. I also prefer a case that flips from the side as opposed to the top. These complaints aside, a case of some kind is a necessity for LifeDrive owners in my opinion, but I wouldn't spend more than $30 on one."
5,Puccini sung by Frenin Milnes and Pavarotti? What could be better?,"I own several recordings of Tosca, but this is still the reigning favorite, featuring a stellar cast at the height of their collective powers. Don't let the 1978 recording date deter you - the sound quality is excellent, and the performance sumptuous from beginning to end."
1,Bargain brands taste better,"I love tea and am very much a connoiseur.Revolution tea is the worst available. I've tried several varieties of Revolution tea when the local tea shops sold it and all the varieties are gross. Most of the coffee/tea shops here no longer sell it.Numi, Republic of Tea and Good Earth all have fine quality teas that I recommend instead of this water pollution."
3,Not his best work,"Rule #1 for a stand-up routine: Don't say the title of your stand-up set during your performance.Rule #2 for a stand-up routine: Don't say the title of your stand-up set during your performance more than 5 times.Pablo broke rules 1 & 2, and in doing so, made the entire performance feel forced, awkward, and cheesy. Yes, there were funny parts and if you're a fan of Pablo Francisco, you'll like this stand-up. He stayed in his comfort zone with the standard impersonations, and Latino humor, but when he did branch out to new comical aspects, it was quickly ruined when Pablo responds to audience shock by quipping, ""I wouldn't make fun of it if they didn't put it out there!"" We get it Pablo: you're doing what everyone else does by observing something and making fun of it. It was observed because ""it's out there."" No need to spell it out for everyone. You're better than this, Pablo! Please bring it strong next time."
3,"good plug, excessive price",plug works in my standby generator. works with natural gas fuel. Price is excessive.
1,yeah right...,"yeah right...we have an writer claiming that a nation that worshipedgreek(hellenic)gods...people that beared greek(hellenic)names...(Alexander,Cleopatra,Philipos,Pausanias...)people who spoke hellenic(did Philip or Alexander needany translators?)People that participated in Olympic games...and last but not least gave a name to a great period inhistory(gee...I think the name is hellenistic)were not hellenes but another nation (slavic maybe...)Woh! I was enlighted reading this book!good job..."
5,In the Shadow of Greek lies and historical falsificates,"Here is Borza to put light on the real truth about Macedonia and Macedonians,and to help Macedonian minority in Greece in the battle for basic civil rights"
4,Nice corer for the price,"This corer is sharp, and easy to use. I do not have a dishwasher, but it is easy to clean by running warm water over the metal and lightly scrubbing with a sponge and dishwashing liquid. The only downside is if your apples are slightly one-sided, it is hard to get the corer to slide over the apple. Overall this is a great buy, and it has encouraged me to eat more apples (and peanut butter!) The product arrived very quickly, in a small package, in perfect new condition."
1,Broke after about 20 apples,"The spot welds broke and the tool fell apart. Poor qual control and shoddy welding = hunk of junk. The plastic should be the weakest link in the slicer, but not on this particular example."
4,Apple corer...,"Works well. We found it works better if you level off the bottom of the apple, and hold a paper towel over the top of the corer so you don't get splashed. Much, much easier than coring the apple with a knife!"
5,Remarkable Resurrection,"This is one of my favorite recordings of anything by anybody. I practically wore out my original LPs of this London recording and now, happily play my CD set - which sonically almost still matches the warmth of the original (I don't know how they did THAT!).Without going into a technical analysis of the work, or of how this recording was so vividly captured, all I can say is this performance is staggeringly powerful. Every instrument - including the famed CSO brass - every voice in the Chicago Symphony Chorus - everyone seems to be captured by the great spirit of Mahler. A simply astonishing achievement."
3,"good ink, SLOW dleivery","Product is as advertised, which is good. Delivery time was very long, so if you need ink in a hurry, look elsewhere."
5,Haunting and Beautiful,Christopher Young's haunting and creepy score for THE GLASS HOUSE is one that you will not forget. It's filled with many beautiful sounds and piano melodies. ***** out of *****! I highly recommend this one to people who appreciate the work of composers.
2,NOT TOTALLY SATISFIED,"I installed this product no problems with the instalation, it was a breeze however the unit would work great for a while then the door bell unit would act up with a loud buzzing sound, it seemed pit up interfarence from everything that passed car sterios, cell phone. If no one is at home to attend to it at the time it just goes on and on with the buzzing until someone cuts the power or something. I have tried switching channels everything the manual says to do and nothing helps. If i have to keep off half the time it sorta defeats the purpose of having it installed in the first place. If anyone wishes to comment or offer any ideas it would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
4,It was a gift,"While we have not installed the item yet, it appears to be exactly what my mom needed. The fact that it connects to your doorbell's wiring was a huge selling point."
4,"Works, but only if both ends on same circuit","We purchased two of these units for a two story building with two entrances. In order to suit our purposes, all four units (two outdoor and two indoor) had to be powered by the same electrical circuit (i.e. from the same breaker). This is different from what the technical materials seem to imply -- that it should work as long as all units are powered by ""the same loop"" of wires coming into the building. We had interference from a copier and maybe other things inside, which rendered channel A unusable, but channel B is okay. This also removes some of the versatility of configuration, but hopefully we will make it serve our needs."
1,Took a chance,Newly wired business but still barely carries a signal and only between two places. Lots of interference.Good idea. Just didn't work for me.
1,NOT Wireless!,"This must be run on the same electrical loop as the doorbell. This is *not* wireless. As other reviews have pointed out, if it is on a different electrical loop, it will not work. It works fine otherwise, but if I'm putting in an intercom, it means that I'm physically away from the door and most likely on a different loop.The manual even defines wireless as ""using airwaves to transmit information, or existing electrical system."" I really doubt this is how most people see wireless. I can't imagine needing to be on the same loop to use my WiFi router."
1,spammer,"Romanshadesexpert.com is linked to repeated and persistent spam on my blog, so I'd be extremely wary about doing business with them. It is possible that they are the victim too, since a spammer can insert any link they like. Just sayin'."
1,A loud and dull Tosca,"The problem with all of Tebaldi/ Del Monaco recordings is how unsubtle and loud they are. Forget about insights in their roles, there are none. Rather get the Callas/De Sabata recording in EMI, quite possibly the greatest recording ever made, or in stereo the Leontyne Price/Karajan. In my opinion, forget about this one."
5,Parsifal. Bayreuth. Awsome.,Other than the few random coughs and the brief decrease in volume in the first act this is a pretty impressive reading of Parsifal. The third act is where everything really comes together. Who can go wrong with a Bayreuth Festival recording of Parsifal?
3,"Outatanding performance, flawed recording.","From a purely musical standpoint this performance is outstanding. Still, the music is continuously spoiled by audience noise, mainly coughing, that add an unwelcome instrument to the orchestra. If modern technology can be used to filter that kind of noise, it wasn't surely used here, to the detriment of the recording."
4,Good Technical Examples of NETBIOS and IPX programming!,"If you are looking for a quick-n-dirty programmer's guide to Netbios, IPX and SPX programming--*this is the book!*Each chapter contains excellent, easy-to-use examples of programming using these common network communications protocols.Whether you are looking for diagnostic tools, or simple on-line chat programs, Schwaderer has it here in simple, quick little tidbits!"
3,An outdated book for outdated technology,"The book was written for the original IBM-DOS and hence, most of the code examples do not work under windows - even running from the DOS prompt. It does give the very basics of NetBIOS and IPX/SPX and if you need to do maintenance of some old legacy code - this is likely the only book around that you are likely to find -- I know it was for me..."
5,"Andre Rieu - At Schonbrunn,Vienna","Excellent variety of songs, music and performances. The Venue for this program in exceptional with both indoor and out of door sceans. The variety of music is a real joy. This is a ""High Class"" performance by all of the artists who appear on the DVD. A truly unexpected treat!"
5,Spectacular... Wonderful... Beautiful...!!!,"Such a fantastic production, complete with beautiful music, funny bits, and an audience that is obviously very engaged. To be in that audience would have been so incredible. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! I don't know what else to say except, if you like Strauss at all, BUY THIS DVD!!"
2,A somewhat valiant try,"That special universe created by P.G. Wodehouse and inhabitated by the most delightful loonies in the English language is one so rarified that it cannot be re-created. Ames tries valiantly with an updated Bertie and Wooster, and he manages to echo the arch voice of the master. But his comic novel is no more than that: an echo that fails to deliver the deliciously eccentric language or the wildly unlikely people and plotting. In fact, the characters, in residence at an artists' colony in Saratoga, become bogged in very unlikely (and mainly tiresome) situations that are rectified only by running away."
4,A great little book,"I really enjoyed this book. It was funny and eccentric. Ames squeezes these little spurts of brilliant insight in between quirky dialogue between himself and Jeeves as well as himself and fellow artists/writers as well as himself and himself. It's not a book I will think about for years to come, but I enjoyed every bit of it. It didn't lag for one second which I appreciate."
5,Call all your friends to quote lines,"Jonathan Ames at his most inspired, most hilarious best. I rarely, and I mean rarely, laugh out loud and this book had me doing it page after page. I actually gave this book to a friend who liked the new Sedaris, but wanted something that would, in her words, '""have her doubled over laughing."" She read ""Wake up Sir"" in a weekend and said it was the funniest thing she'd read in as long as she could remember.Go out right now and get it. It's that good."
5,Funniest book EVER!,"I loved this book so much that I want everyone I know to read it, and you too! Hy.ster.i.cal."
1,"Big Disappointment, Sir","Several chuckles and a great initial premise, but the basic story of a man falling deeper and deeper into failure and self-loathing didn't appeal to me. After a while you simply expect all of his aspirations to fail and that's what you get. The ending was a cheap loop to the title which prompted me to toss the book across the room into the trash."
4,"Wake Up, Sir","""Wake Up, Sir"" by Jonathan Ames is an enjoyable read. It reads quickly, is sort of funny, and is very entertaining. I thought it started out slowly and wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but it picked up quite a bit after about the first main section.The narrator/protagonist, Alan Blair, is quite a character. He's a raging alcoholic, but in a funny sort of way. You almost feel bad for the guy. His adventures are very memorable.Alan has a personal valet named Jeeves. You don't get to know too much about Jeeves, as he's sort of a guarded, detached character.Overall, there is a lot of good character development in this book. The tales of Alan going to the artist colony are great. This is a good book with some unforgettable parts. It starts off slowly, but I found it well worth my time."
5,Quite Funny,"This is possibly the funniest novel I have ever read. Alan our narrator has overdosed on Wodehouse, having read 45 of his 90+ novels. After winning a large personal injury settlement, he decides to hire a manservant, whose name happens to be Jeeves. Ames nicely updates Wodehouse's Wooster in Alan. This Jeeves seem less of a force than the original. After a trip to a decaying resort town, Jeeves and Alan arrive at an artists' colony, which gives Ames a wonderful opportunity to lambaste himself and other artists. Though there is one chapter that seemed completely out-of-sync with the rest of the novel, I absolutely loved this book and found myself laughing two or three times on every page. Also, hands down the best suthor photograph ever."
4,Very entertaining,"Ames's novel is basically a single, extended joke: Bertie Wooster reincarnated as a neurotic, alcoholic Jewish American writer named Alan Blair. The joke wears out after about 200 pages, but the comic faux-British narration never wavers, and the Jeeves character is endearingly rendered. I agree with the other reviewer about the occasional grammatical error (""I"" instead of ""me,"" for example), especially since the conceit here is that Alan affects a prim-proper King's English. Nonetheless, the novel is pleasant way to spend a lazy summer day. This guy is clever as hell, and genuinely funny."
2,alas! American humor,"Surely anyone pining for a dose of Wodehouse could find some real Wodehouse to read? The joke here is that our Bertie anti-hero is Jewish, and Jeeves is imaginary, and once you've laughed yourself silly at that, that's that.And try not to worry that the honorable Scribner imprint hasn't bothered to correct the grammar."
2,Only drug abuser's should be able to talk about drugs!,"This book was not at all useful and really boring. Take a bunch of medical research and add a dull author who obviously doesn't know anything about drugs except what he heard> terrible writing and fiction all over the book.HOW COULD SOMEONE TALK ABOUT RECOVERY AND ABUSE IF THEY HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED IT! tHIS BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED""THE BASIC RULES OF HYPOCRISY AND THE DULL AUDIENCE WHO IS EASILY BRAINWASHED"""
2,disappointed,"The quality of the minature box was a disappointment. I did not hear the music , as this was to be a gift."
2,bad small case,"its badly designed,,it only fits the laptop and the adapter,,but it doesnt fit when i install the dvd media base,,also you only can hold it in your hand but u cant put it on your shoulder,,it doesnt have hanger for shoulder"
4,Not Too Sure.....,"I have read a review from epinions.com that says this is a great television. However after reading the review from amazon.com, I found that there are problems that were never mentioned. Right now I have no idea if it is good or not. Please write a reply to this message or at least select ""yes"", that this message was useful, to say that I should by this television. And select ""no"", to say that I should by another television."
5,The best yet!,"This ""Sacred Love Making video is so fun and uplifting we shared it with friends and family and suggested they get their own copy as well.The author is beautiful and compassionate while iilustrating the Tantric way of lovemaking in such a divine way. What fun to know how to create and share ones orgasms with a lover and feel in love with ALL, multiple times and at ones own control.Love this DVD, thanks for giving the public this valuable art of love."
3,Language translator,Most hand held languge translators provide an insuffcient vocabulary.This device is no exception. It is only a very slight step above theless expensive TWE-100 by Franklin. It does offer seven additional languages and all have skimpy vocabularies.
4,"Vintage 70's Sound, Doom, Blues","Nostalgic, vintage, doom rock. Hard to believe this album was recorded in 2003, and not 1963 (in a good way). The Animals meets Black Sabbath. Very similar to Pentagram's ""First Daze Here (1971-1975)"" recordings. Very warm, bluesy metal. Sounds like Zeppelin or the Birds, and sometimes like the Beatles in parts. The track, ""No Angel, No Demon"" is worth the price of the CD.Good instrumentation. Great continuity. I've had this CD playing non-stop for about 3 days, now. It has a mellow, English vibe, and not much attitude or agression to speak of. Still, this album is superior to all the nuMetal on MTV and the rap-rock on commercial rock radio stations, and most of what's on the underground rock radio stations, too! Joe Bob says, ""Check it out!""Several very catchy songs, but not as many as hoped (so only 4 stars). We'll see what the band's next album is like. Get Pentagram's ""First Daze"" album first, if you don't already yet have it."
5,move over Sabbath,"Another great release from TMC. Recorded and released in 2004, this sounds straight out of prime era Black Sabbath but possibly even better. Retro doom. Just get it and thank me later."
3,Not worth the extra expense for business adapter,"I bought the Linkysys Wireless N Adapter Business version and the regular version. I have both and they work great on Thinkpad and HP notebooks in the house. The problem has been durability of the card if they are bumped or dropped. The Wireless N Business is more expensive and in my opinion not worth the added costs over the regular version. I researched it initially them both and thought the Business version would be more durable, but I honestly think the plain version is better made. A slight drop of my laptop made the adapter worthless today with the soldering beding at the connection. I had no problem getting them running and speeding along with the N wifi, just skip the business adapter and save $20-30. In fact I am ordering another plain Linksys N adpapter to replace the broken Business version."
2,Not Vista friendly.,"This is a very frustrating adapter for Vista run laptops. The quick install CD-ROM does not work with Windows Vista. I had to download the updated quick install and driver for Vista from Linksys' website. After installing and loading the drivers, this adapter could only get limited access to the Linksys WAP4400N access point. I had to reset back to Windows adapter configurator and not use the Linksys one to get back full access."
4,fragile but works great,"works great, 270 speed, good range but I dropped computer on its edge and the card broke in half, the computer was fine (ibm thinkpad)never had that before, I have 4 other cards--they all work fine but be careful physically with them"
4,Great advice before your trip!,This book is a must-read BEFORE your trip. Don't learn the hard way...like I did. Useful tips and advice made our second trip much more enjoyable. GET THIS BOOK.
3,OK - but not easy to use,"We bought this for our daughter's room. It heats it but it has to run constantly. There is a ""timer"" but good luck figuring it out (it's mechanical). It is quiet enough. If you want a basic space heater, this is pretty much it since the controls appear useless."
5,Pretty Boys Making Kick-Ass Music,"I had the privledge of seeing this band at Don Hill's last summer and was blown away. Their music is catchy, rocking and hip. The Adored are fantastic performers with impeccable style and infectious energy.Got the EP today and proceeded to dance around my bedroom in wild abandon. Loved the addition of Pete Shelley of the Buzzcocks on ""TV Riot"" and ""Sex is in Fashion."" Quality disk. Can't wait for their first full-length!"
5,Disney Does Swing!,"Disney's ""House of Mouse"" replaced ""MouseWorks"" a couple years ago on Disney's One Saturday Morning. The show takes place in the local Disney 'toon nightclub in Main Street, Toontown. The scripts skillfully put Disney's classic characters all together for the first time, resulting in some very funny situations. For instance, Snow White is horrified when she is served a shiny red apple and Iago from ""Aladdin"" joins forces with a band of other Disney birds to perform ""Parrots of the Carribbean"", a takeoff on the classic Disney parks ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".This cd is the result of many of the wacky and upbeat musical numbers that take place during the show. The whole Disney music spectrum is covered, with everything from ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf"" to ""Bibbidi, Bobbidi, Boo"", ""The Three Caballeros"" to ""Grim Grinning Ghosts"" being performed by some of the most unlikely Disney characters. This cd is a real blast and rounds out any Disney music collection."
4,a must have,"Nice ablbum with songs from the Disney series. Unfortunately not re-released, so only available through re-sellers."
4,Elementary Friendly Series,"Overall great DVD. Two stories, age 10 and then age 5 - first one has a very awkward edit that may actually be a mistake? It's not that big of a deal though...Consider your audience and how comfortable you feel with explaining/fielding questions about one of the families having 5 maids who are all much darker skin than they. It's a cultural difference based on a lot of history and something that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this item just as long as you're prepared to discuss (my discussion was with 3rd and 4th graders.)"
5,Best Match up!,"My nana(Grandmother) introduced me to this CD...I always loved to listen to both Pepe and Marco Antonio while I was growing up and the fact that they put out a CD with both of their songs, almost made me jump for joy....almost....I only wish there would've been MORE songs, maybe even a double disc effort....but the songs on here are wonderful, I definitley recommend this to any one who loves this particular music and well...specifically these two artists!!"
5,Cuna de Lobos,Great Spanish Novela! The character's are excellent and the story unfolds in the same manner as our American Daytime Dramas
2,Cuna de Lobos DVD 2007,"La edición de Cuna de Lobos 2007 tiene una pésima musicalización de fondo. Esto arruina totalmente la obra como originalmente se presento al aire por TV. Inclusive el tema musical que daba comienzo esta totalmente cambiado, haciendo de este DVD una novela totalmente aburrida por su alteración original. Qué lastima, pues el drama de la novela es buenísimo pero estos nuevos cambios la convertido en algo que no vale la pena pagar por tener una copia de algo que en sus tiempo fue y ha sido una de las mejores novelas que la empresa Televisa ha hecho."
1,LOWEST QUALITY EVER,"WOW, i cant believe that Xenon pictures has done it again, after messing up la antorcha encendida, now CUNA DE LOBOS is the biggest disapointment. I am not talking about the wack music, this is BEYOND THAT! The dvd simply sucks. IT has a factory manufacturing problem. THE DVD is defected. Its weird, the first time i played disc 1, no problem, but on disc 2, side 2, the dvd started acting up, freezing up and stuff. Then, disc 3 seemed to be okay, but suddendly it also started freezing up. I removed it, and i put it back on, and it read ""Error"". I went back to disc 1, which was working fine, and all of a sudden it started messing up too. I took it to another dvd player and the same started happening. I ordered a new DVD, and guess what? the same thing happened again. I play my other dvds and i know its not my dvd player, because everything else is fine.I think the Alter films version of Cuna de Lobos is okay, but the Xenon pictures version is really bad."
3,Great Novela-Worst ever soundtrack,"This series is actually super, but I have never witnessed a background music more horrible than this.The background music in more than half of the movie becomes so loud that you cant hear what the actors are saying.The series in itself receive 5 starsThe music in the series that ruins the film receives 1 starsIn total the series is drawn to 2 to 3 stars."
3,only Italian language,"Sorry, only one movie is in FRENCH, all the others in italian language, subtitels in english, but in the product description is wroten ""French"". A lot of money for 4 movies and only one to understanding.Quality of DVD OK, why I give 3 stars anyway."
4,Happy,I received the product quickly at the time promised. It was beautifully packaged and the quality of the movies are very nice. This was a gift for a friend and I was proud to present it to him.
2,not the greatest sophia loren films,The first two films are quite boring. The second two dvd's get better. Not the greatest package of her films.
3,Awesome album,"This is a nice album , Gotta go home is really great , and some other on the album too . i give a rated a 3 stars cause its a bit too commercial sound that we here everywhere but still a good album. Dj [x-td] 57787589"
5,Under-rated Solti,"It seems somewhat fashionable to regard Solti's collaboration with the CSO in a negative light. In this case, his interpretation and the CSO's performance rises to the occasion. The engineering is superb, the orchestra fosters a most pleasing balance between articulation and passion. I really don't think Kubelik's interpretation warrants such kudos when clearly there are more deserving alternatives. This recording really deserves more attention."
2,Good you can't get this anymore,"I got theis from Dish after a protracted fight to get the RCA 40"" RP machine repaired. ( They couldn't fix it after 4 months)This machine freaks out when I touch it. I cleaned the screen,or have a power failure, the computer flips out. It flips through the menus, automatically reduces the volume to zero, and goes into the setup menu when powered on. This thing is possessed by the Devil!My second, and last RCA/Thompson product. This is garbage, even if free. Don't even think of buying RCA/Thompson unless you like headaches."
2,There is no crew debriefing in this book.,It is missing the most enjoyable part of this book series.
1,English Please!,"I was quite disappointed when I opened this book and found the contents of the pages to be utter gibberish to me. This text is NOT in English. However, this is VERY misleading because when you preview the first few pages of the book it IS in the English version...so I bought this book thinking that it would be something completely different than it is. Good thing it was only 7 dollars. Complete waste of money and very misleading and dishonest."
2,RCA TV SUCKS!,"I have this TV and it currently is being used as my cats pedastool. This TV is great when it works! The picture is bright and vivid, sound is great.When it doesn't work, most of the time, the picture jumps, turns to black and white, sometimes there is no picture; black screen with audio.I recommend going with another TV. This one is too frustrating to deal with and not worth the money."
1,Junk,I bought this TV two years ago. Now when I turn it on the sound comes but I have no video. I hope i can get something for it in a pawn shop!!!!
1,junk,"I bought the RCA F27650 27"" TV and the sound stopped working within the first 4 months. I took it to an RCA approved store to fix the problem. They kept the TV for over a month before even getting back to me with an estimate. They never attempted to contact me, and I had to call several times just to find out what the problem was. The parts were all covered, but just the labor alone was going to cost me as much as the TV cost origionally. I am now the proud owner of a soundless TV that is of no use except for keeping up space in my shed. I will never buy an RCA again."
3,good for american standards...,"Well, I bought this tv based on the reviews on this site.I do have to say that the reviewers are very easy to please.Anyway: this tv DOESN'T look like a flat screen at all, the picture has a clear distortion converging to the center of the screen - the horizontal lines next to the borders will look curved-.Quite disappointing since I have a panasonic way older (not a flat screen) that displays better images.I will try to change it."
5,Old music that lives forever...,Very romantic music in the beautiful voice of Doris Day and the magnificent piano of Andre Previn: !the perfect duet!...
5,It is all in the nuances,"Not much to add to the unanimous 5-star reviews here. Doris Day will alway be one of the greatest singers of popular music. Why? One: the rich, natural tone of her voice. Two (and most importantly), her amazing GIFT for phrasing and shading. Just listen. I won't say more because it leaps right out at you. The voice of Doris Day is something very special and we are blessed by her presence in American popular music."
1,look elsewhere for insight,"This book is a waste of time. It continually references Pollack and Kindlon, who have written much better books about boys. It did not contain any new insights. It is an academic study, more like a compilation of other peoples' work, and gives no advice or examples of how to actually improve communication with your boy. I am tired of these books that give us a bunch of handwringing about how bad things are for boys, and then don't tell us how, as individuals, to deal with it."
1,Useless statistics,"I found this book virtually useless. Included numerous statistical informaion, without much useful advise or guidance."
3,Disappointed in performance,"The little plane doesn't fly well if you simply throw it. It comes with an attachment to hold onto while launching the plane with a rubber band. My little grandson can't do that yet, nor would we want him to, due to the chocking hazard of the piece & the rubber band. The plane seems to be durable."
1,Didn't live,The plants were in good shape when I got them...but they didn't live. No more ordering plants online.
4,"A Marvelous Little Book, by fermed","This exquisite book has two distinct aspects which need to be rated separately. The first has to do with the descriptions of the physics and...mechanics... the book rates five stars plus.The second aspect of the book has to do with the emotional and psychological portraits of the cast of characters of this curious little book. Somehow the author does not render the people of the story very well: they never seem to come alive, remaining distant, two-dimensional, unreachable. For this aspect the book rates three stars....this book is irresistible."
4,The building of Santa Maria del Fiore.,"This is a wonderful little story about the building of Santa Maria Del Fiore by Filippo Brunelleschi. This domed church is one of the marvels of the world and led Medieval man into the Renaissance. This book details how a dream became an actual building through the genius of Fillippo. Not only did he solve how a dome could be built of thousands of tons of stone and stay upright, but he managed to design many of the machines that helped build the dome including lifts, and cranes. This story also details the rivalry of Filippo and Lorenzo Ghiberti who was brilliant in the casting of bronze doors. These two man not only built, but were also great artists.Ross King does a good job of detailing a story about Renaissance architecture into something that a modern reader would be interested in. The story is short but very compelling. The intro leaves a little to be desired but the rest of the story flows very smoothly."
3,Technical Manual/Historical Overview,"This is an excellent book for those wanting a detailed account of just how they built those amazing buildings durring the renaisssance. If you are looking for a great intrigue/historical novel...look elsewhere! It is jam-packed with facts, notations and historical trivia facts. It however is almost too technical (it was for me anyway!). It read very similar to an electronical device manual (dvd, vcr,etc...) and who really reads those? It was ok...but just be warned...It was a little hard to follow at times."
4,Never Say Impossible,"This book is certainly a triumph of research. How can so many details be uncovered after so long a time? This is the fascinating story of the construction of the dome atop Santa Maria del Fiore, a cathedral in Florence, and a story suggested by another book I read on Leonardo da Vinci. Also it is the story of Filippo Brunelleschi, who, stacked with the greatest odds against him, managed construction of the magnificent dome. It would seem an impossible task with 15th century technology but Brunelleschi designed his own cranes and other equipment which allowed the construction to proceed. I found each page intriguing and I was almost as amazed by the author's ability to uncover the story in such detail as the story itself. That said, I found some of the architectural descriptions puzzling and would have preferred a definition of terms and modern drawings to illustrate the text. Modern day photographs would have been a plus, too."
4,Compelling portrait of early Renaissance,"Ross King gives us a portrait of early Renaissance Italy vivid enough we can smell the cheap wine swilled by laborers in Florence. The true story of the construction of this cathedral, including its astonishing dome, is foolish and wonderful. The emergence of Brunelleschi and his competition with Lorenzo Ghiberti (who produced the amazing doors of the Baptistery, where a replica now stands) serves as a story which shows the creativity but also the competitiveness and vanity of a time that is often romanticized.Laymen interested in the mechanical details of Brunelleschi's groundbreaking machines and designs may find themselves up against the limits of their imagination, as the book restricts itself to prose descriptions and relies on period drawings to illustrate the mechanics."
5,Genius is in the details...,"Ross King can take the story of a small, seemingly insurmountable problem and turn it into an intriguing bit of drama: how to build a dome without a frame to lean it on? How to lift huge blocks of marble for the lantern off the ground, up into the sky, and over to the precise spot they are needed? He moves easily back and forth from the intriguing rivalry between Brunelleschi and Alberti to the details of the dome's engineering.It's even a nice reflection of the book's theme that the book itself is well designed.Brunelleschi's Dome will have broad appeal to a lot of non-fiction readers: history buffs, archaeology, biography, engineering. Based on the other reviews, the only folks who were disappointed are those expecting a highly academic, detailed account. This is more of a charming, scientific and artistic fable....but true."
3,"enjoyable read, needs more diagrams","I found this to be a very enjoyable and quick read. I was entertained by all the distractions that affected the completion (plague, invasions, pope visits, rivalries, etc) and was intrigued by the fact that he had to engineer not only the dome but also the equipement for the construction. My only negative is that I would have really appreciated more sketches and diagrams to describe how it all went together. It was nice that they had some old sketches and pictures, but a diagram of the whole church with lables would have been really helpful at the beginning. I'm no expert on European church architecture so I didn't know where in the church half the stuff was they were talking about. Also, I'm an engineer and after reading the book, I still didn't understand how some of it went together. Overall it was enjoyable introduction to architecture and construction of the time."
2,The Structural Skeleton of the Dome,"This book gives due credit to one of the world's greatest and lasting architectural achievements. However, it provides very little useful insight into the structural skeleton and its elements, and how the whole structure actually hangs together. There is a lot of arm waving on the subject, and the pictures/text on the sandstone chain, the quinto acuto arch (shown incorrectly), the herringbone brickwork, and the arch rings are almost useless. A student of architectural structure is left with little concrete information."
3,But where do you hang your hat?,"I really wanted to like this book. I like the renaissance - history and art - people and places involved. But i had a hard time getting fascinated by this book. It isn't really a biography of brunelleschi, and i never found myself caring for the man. He isn't fleshed out fully as a person. Nor is it a history of architecture, and so the dome never seems as compelling as it may (have) be(en). Also as a book on florence, or renaissance history as such, it just ain't detailed enough.So in the end, i couldn't find anything in this eggshaped dome to hang my hat on."
3,Good book,Enjoyed this book. Incredible that he could design it so well at the time with the supports and materials. Interesting narrative
4,History Comes to Life,"This book brings an era to life. I can feel the people and the passions behind the stones and the much-vaunted accomplishments of the times. To this day, Brunelleschi's dome is the dominant feature you see when you drive over the mountains from Bologna. Even enshrouded in the smog and wires of the industrial outskirts of the city it is magnificent."
4,So sorry I didn't climb the dome on my recent trip to florence....,"I travel a ton and I am so sorry I didn't climb Brunelleschi's Dome. After reading this book, I want to go back, just to climb and see all the details I just read about. At times the book got slow and technical, but it was overall fascinating.....Stands the test of time...."
4,Interesting,"I loved the little know tidbits that were included in the book. I particularly liked the ongoing rivalry between Brunelleschi and Ghiberti.I like another reader would have appreciated either more diagrams (even if not of the period) to go along with the written description of some of the machines and techniques. They were rather hard for me to visualize.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."
4,Interesting read,"This book is clearly written and is a enjoyable read. While I was reading it, I was really caught up in the drama and intrigue surrounding the character Filippo. But after finishing the book I had the time to reflect back on it and judge it from the distance. Considering that this project took over a quarter of a century, a few major setbacks should naturally have been expected. Parts of this book reads like a college essay - full of excessive details, footnotes and unnecessary and boring information thrown in to increase the volume of the contents. Although I did find the parts on the building design somewhat interesting, but was kind of distracted by the enormous number of 'scandals' the author referred to. I would say it is more enjoyable as a light read rather than a academic work. Nonetheless I found it enjoyable."
2,"Promising, but unfocused and poorly researched","By all means borrow this book and read it, but don't waste your money to buy it. Mr. King frequently hints at interesting avenues which would further explain Brunelleschi, the driving forces behind the building of the dome, and Brunelleschis' technical accomplishments. Unfortunately, either for lack of research ability, interest, sources, or some combination thereof, he only scratches the surface of his subject.Look at Galileo's Daughter for an example of what this book could have been."
3,Only 1 BIG problem,"The system over all is great. But there's one big problem in my opinion, that I am concerned about, the Progressive Scan feature. Given you will need to output the video with component cables in order to receive 480p/780p (pending your HDTV monitor). However, the ""P-Scan"" feature is ... I'm sorry to say, ""pathetic."" The manual states that you have to hold down the ""P-Scan"" button on your remote for more than 5 seconds to toggle in between either ""P-Scan"" or ""I-Scan"" (Interlaced) and that's it. I've tried this, and haven't noticed any positive improvement on picture quality. Even worse, there is no display feature on the DVD system nor the monitor to let you know if you're in P-Scan mode. I've compared the progressive scan to my older DVD player, and the older DVD player progressive scan's picture quality is much better. Hope this helps."
5,I love Everything about this book,"I must admit that I already was a fan of the 'Everything Books' before I ordered this one. I first fell in love with the ""The Everything Christmas Book"". So, I knew that I would would be completely satisfied with ""The Everything Reiki Book"" as well and I was."
3,in the details,"when someone who is supposedly a master of something can get wrong things like the time Reiki (as opposed to other forms of energy healing) has been around, or fails to understand the inherent differences between the healing practice of Reiki and the universal life force (ch'i) that it directs, then you maybe have to wonder how really well she understands her subject."
4,fun,This is a great punk rock cd to pop in and just listen to anytime. I am really glad I bought it.
2,Waste of Paper,"Very disappointing. There are lots of nasty comments about players, which belies the objectivity officials are supposed to have. Each page is covered with a large ego; there is no news here, no insights."
1,Buy a different book!,"As a h.s. football official, I buy EVERY book on officiating or by an official that comes out. In the case of ""Meat Grinder,"" I wish I'd made an exception.It is written in 3rd person by someone who'd have a hard time writing a decent 5-page h.s. English paper. I was literally bored of the book by the third page and THREW IT OUT!The copy I bought was taken OUT of the collection of a library...that should've tipped me off. Trust me, this book is TERRIBLE."
4,Ok,"This book features very interesting information about football officiating and NFL football in general. I enjoyed reading the book, however it was written in a rather meandering style.The language is rated R, but if you can handle it, I would recommend this book for hardcore NFL and referee fans."
2,Review from the birds,The birds do not like this bird feeder. I really don't know why except that it is plastic and hard for their feet to grab on to. Seed bunches up and gets wet at the bottom and molds.
1,Not very strong,I ordered two of these and one broke very quickly. The yellow part that the bird stands on isn't very strong and snapped right off.
3,As expceted,"Cheap frame and does what it is supposed to, which is only cosmetic, nothing functional. Very thin outline; could have come with screws for the price but does not"
2,"Solid, but too small.","Solid frame, and would look good if covers your plate. I'm in MA and the plate is visible all around the outside of the frame, so it looks stupid. Didn't end up using it. Not sure if other states have different size plates or what, but not a recommended purchase.I used the 20150 black larger rim frame on my wife's Grand Cherokee, and that looks great. I assumed the other width/height of this would be the same and the ""slim rim"" just wouldn't come in as far, but that's not the case."
3,"Looks good, too small","I bought this frame because I needed one smaller than the perimeter style for my front plate (too large for a dodge charger). This one was definitely small enough, but as some people have said it doesn't even cover the whole plate! Luckily my plate slides into the front bracket so the sides are covered by that, but the bottom still sticks out below the frame.I don't know how you screw up something that should be a standard size.However, it looks better with than without, so I'm leaving it on until I find something better."
4,Elegant,"Beautiful frame of good quality. Most cars nowadays have only the two upper scres for fastening. You can saw off the lower ones, but a re-design would be a better solution."
3,It's okay!!,"Although this plate frame is legal in our state because it does not cover any of the wording on the license plate, it is a tad too small to cover the entire plate (a few mm off). Other than that is is fine."
4,Good frame for the money,"It is metal, no plastic. It is just a frame, no clear plastic shield, but again, good for the price. It is the SAME SIZE as the license plate, the plate does NOT fit inside the frame, they go edge to edge. It you look really close, you may notice this, but if you are that fussy, you should expect to pay more."
3,less a frame than an overlay,"This license plate ""frame"" is just a bit too small to actually frame my license plate. More accurately, it sits on top of the license plate, and the edges are visible outside the ""frame"" at the sides and bottom. But since no one will be looking closely at my license plate, it's OK. It's pretty, it's shiny, and it's slim so it doesn't cover my tags. Good enough."
2,Does NOT Fit California Plates,"It's close, but overall I'd summarize this as the typical ""you get what you pay for"". Maybe some of them fit, but mine didn't. And the holes don't line up perfectly either. Manufacturing tolerances of this product clearly aren't top notch. If you care about your car, I recommend that you don't skimp out even on a license plate bracket. Pay an extra 5-20 bucks to get something of higher quality and better fit and finish. For what it is and what it costs, I suppose the product is OK (2 stars), but hopefully this review will help set your expectations low."
1,Too Small for Washington Plates,"The frame is the exact same size as my Washington state plates so you could see the actual plates around the border of the frame. I went to O'Reilly's and purchased their ""Custom Frames"" frame that was similar in appearance. The frames I purchased from O'Reilly's were $8/each but were of much higher quality. The Cruisers were okay, but definitely along the lines of ""you get what you pay for."" Anyway, I plan on returning these."
2,Not a great fit,"Although this product is still on my car and doesn't look bad, it would have been nice if the license plate frame actually completely covered the license plate. Otherwise it's a pretty sturdy product."
5,"Great condition, exactly what I expected.","excellent album, toned down from the typical UFO, but still very good, in my opinion."
5,Rocking like it is suppose to be done,Unlike the crap infesting the airwaves now these guy blast hard and get spool it down for the assorted ballads. This is what it was all about in the heyday of Arena Rock.The disk took a while to get here otherwise the folks did a good job and would recommend them.
4,VERY GOOD CD,"The reviews of the non shenker albums by the shenker worshipers make me sick. If your a true fan of UFO then why do you disrespect the rest of the ass kickin personnel of the shenker lineup just because shenker is not on it.I am i friggin DIEHARD UFO fan that has ALL,I repeat all the albums. And most of the Chapman stuff i hate to break the news to you people is just as good as the shenker stuff IE.. lone gone, chains chains, no place to run, blinded by a lie, you people are pathetic.I guess vinnie moore sucks too , YEAH...OK....He would blow shenker off the stage..anyhow from someone who loves ALL UFO ...trust me buy making contact,no place to run,and wild willing and innocent, you wont be disappointed!"
2,POOR FIT,"In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back."
4,a good rock group,"hello,this is one group that likes to rock and they sound better live then they do in the studio, i highly recommend this album, if you like all man brothers,, or metalica or just good ole rock music listen to the super suckers"
5,Almost like watching the shows,"We dropped cable a year ago, but now we can enjoy most of our favorite songs from Playhouse Disney. We were really missing them, so this is really fun to get and play."
5,Great for All Ages,"We really enjoy this CD. Our three year old loves to dance to all of the tracks especially ""Dancing the Day Away"". It is great for car trips because the music is enjoyable for children and adults."
4,Playhouse Disney fan,I bought this CD for the Rolie Polie Olie theme song. I was somewhat disappointed that the opening or the closing Bear in the Big Blue House themes were not included. Otherwise I am happy with the CD.
3,It's just okay...,"I like this CD, but in my opinion it's a little heavy on the songs from Bear in the Big Blue House and The Book of Pooh. My children would like it better if there were fewer songs from those shows and more from the others."
4,Oodles of Fun,"I admit that sometimes I listen to this CD when my daughter is not around. It's so much fun and I just love some of the theme music (Pooh and Rolie Polie Olie). I am disappointed that the theme and the Goodbye songs from Bear in the Big Blue House were not on the CD but the songs that are on the CD are pretty good. I didn't recognize a lot of the songs at first but after multiple listens (and if you have a little one you WILL hear this a lot!) I got know the songs and we enjoy them. Otherwise this CD is great for dancing to, a car ride or for pre-bedtime music. My six-year-old niece even requests this when she comes over so this is good music for the family."
5,My BF LOVED it!,"I gave this to my boyfriend for his 25th birthday recently. He is a big hockey buff, loves the Flyers, knows all about their history, and he thought this was a solid DVD. It doesn't skip over important seasons and gives a very comprehensive look at this franchise. I give it 5 stars because I actually sat through it and was really entertained! I've only been watching hockey for a few years now, and wouldn't call myself a ""big fan."" Also I liked it because it made me feel like a cool girlfriend for getting him a gift he actually enjoyed."
3,nice,"a good movie for a diehard flyers fan, but a little drawn out.spends a great deal of time on early history and not much on recent."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Monet - Essence (Purpose, 2004)Flutist Monet drops her second album which is full of nice grooves; it's perfect for any neo-soul completists. I'm not feeling her much as a singer, though; it seems like the flute is her bread-and-butter. However, she does a good job of flipping The Doobie Brothers' ""Minute by Minute"", where she plays the flute and sing. -EJR"

2,Personally~ didn't like the book.,"I personally did not enjoy this book at all.. It was way too scrambled for me. They start you off with stories of different women, throwing in names and events every other word. I had an extremely hard time trying to keep up with what the heck was going on the entire time. I read it because it was an assignment for class.. But I do feel like I wasted time trying to understand it. In my opinion, of course."
4,A mixed bag of Nebula and Lowrider,"I've always thought that Nebula, for whatever reason, performs a lot better on their singles and their EPs than on their full length album. The Double EP certainly has its low points, but Nebula brings it all together at the end of their half with ""Fall of Icarus"" and its punchy bassline.The Lowrider half is excellent, their first three songs could be deleted tracks off ""Ode to Io"" but the final one ""Upon the Dune"" branches out and fades away into a weed induced daydream."
2,Nice performances but a poor recording,"Although I enjoyed the performances that Pascal Roge gave on this CD, the recording could have been much better. There is too much reverb on the recording. There also doesn't seem to be much high-end on the recording making it sound rather ""muddy"" to my ears. I have to give it low marks because of that. Consequently I'm returning my copy."
3,Hop Forever Vol. II was way better!,"I am a big fan of DJ Jazzy Jeff, there is no other like him out there. But wasn't too happy about this CD. I have to say hands down Hop Forever Vol. II was a better one. I think this one just lacked some of his talent of great mixing. On Hop Forever Vol. II he has his own part where he is scratching and mad the artistes he put together on that CD was a great line up from Asher to Blackmoon to everyone great. This one just didn't do it for mePeace and Blessings"
1,not up to Merrell quality,"I'm amazed this shoe is still on the market. I love Merrell insoles, but these shoes are flimsy and lack arch support. But what makes these shoes terrible is that the heel rubs up high on the foot. They really tear up my skin."
5,BRAVI,"WOW, this is the most exciting recording of Verdi's masterpiece I've ever heard. This is better than the version with Reiner and Bjoeling for three reasons...the singers, the conductor, and the sound. Joan Sutherland has the weight of voice to do justice to the soprano role. At the time of this recording, whatever comes out of this woman throat was spectacular. She has a more beautiful voice than Leontyne Price, but she certainly does not have as much temperament. Pavorotti, the icon sings very beautiful here. As noted by another reviewer he was only in his thirties when this was recorded. In my opinion, Pavorotti has a far more important voice than Bjoeling - it certainly is a more ringing voice. As for Horne, of course she had a gorgeous voice, but for some reason, I prefer Elias. But what makes this recording remarkable is the conducting of Solti and the fantastic sound quality. Wow is all I can say."
5,Breathtaking,"While I have only had the opportunity to hear one other version of this piece (Shaw/Atl) I can confidently say this recording does not disapoint. The quartet--which interestingly highlights the bass and mezzo more than the tenor and soprano, I think--is fantastic, as is the chorus, orchestra, and conducting. If this recording could be said to have any flaws, it would be, of course, Suthland's diction; also, Horne's singing is a matter of taste. Personaly, I think there is nothing in the world like those tenoresque lines in the ""Liber scriptus."" Every word sung by Tavela is beautiful, but I'd have to say the most heartstopping moment is Pavorotti's entrance in the Kyrie--it is absolutely breathtaking."
5,When can we Download it for the wii,I would really like to know when we can download this bad boy for the wii. They are holding out on me and i dont like it.
2,Well...,"She have a beautiful voice but some of the songs are stupid. ""Pienso en ti"" and ""It's ok"" are my favorites but in "" Embrujada por tu amor"" and ""Ya basta"" she sounds silly. ""Mil Besos"" boooooooriiiiinnnnng.""Higher"" - are u trying to do ""Let's get Loud"" by Jennifer Lopez?. I can't stand ""Cobarde"" it doesn't make any sense. What kind of tittle is ""Rompe""??. ""Cuanto te quiero""- she sounds like a desperate girl trying to get some....I don't know. She can do better.And she's not an Alanis MorisetteBy the way, How old is she? 14?"

3,Doing the best with bad material,"Based on the Doctor Who serial of the same name, ""The Invisible Enemy"" has to contend with a sad fact--this is not a very good story. Oh, the first half was good, but once the giant shrimp appears, well, it's all downhill.Terrence Dicks was the long time story editor of the show, and has written a boatload of novelizations. He is always quite capable, but it never realy rises above the level of competent hackwork. I'd classify this a beach read, as long as you leave the beach in an hour."
2,Not that good!,"Although Alicia V. has a very nice voice, she's not one of my favorites.The only reason that I bought the CD : I like ""El Ladron"".The song is an oldie. Was a popular song back in the 50's. It has a nice beat and reminds me of my childhood. My mom used to sing it."
1,Not Reputable,"Be aware that this book was written by a political hack who seeks to discredit one of the three best American presidents for totally unrelated reasons. This book is so far from reality that it simply is ridiculous to even begin to comment on it. If you really want to learn about FDR, read something by a scholar who has devoted decades to the study of the FDR administration. You will then learn the good and the not so good TRUTH.This book is not that."
1,can I give it less than 1 star,Oh my goodness. I had the impression that the book was going to attempt to present an objective view of FDR but I was wrong. It was nothing more than a hatchet job on one of the greatest presidents to serve and lead this country.Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.
1,Baying at the moon,"Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter."
4,Worth reading,"Funny and intense. It gets a little old toward the end, but piece by piece it builds an overwhelming case that the venerated FDR was actually an unprincipled demagogue (as sensible contemporary observers knew). Roosevelt wreaked havoc on the Constitution and our Republic has never recovered from it. He was the first politician to effectively understand that buying votes could build powerful coalitions.Maybe someday we will tear down the Roosevelt Memorial just like Eastern Europeans ripped down statues of Lenin and Stalin. One can dream..."
4,FDR During His Times,"There are many better histories of the Roosevelt Presidency, but this is one of the first ones to expose some of FDR's more controversial leadership traits. This is a good book for anyone seeking to understand the 1930s and 1940s and how and why FDR made certain decisions."
4,not on time,"the product works great,should have black or not shine buckles. The only beef a got is when I purchase them I paid extra to receive them in two days. receive partial shipment .I needed them for a two week hunting trip. four weeks later I receive the other set I ordered. I use the straps for my ladders that attach to trees"
5,Move over Bosstones....,"...the Mendozas are simply the best ska revivalists hoeing that music's row today.There's no shame in admitting that I, as a young undergraduate, skanked and drank'd the night away in many of Beantown's sweatiest drives--all to the driving riddims of an equally young Mendoza Line. Their bottom was solid, their harmonies were tight, and their enthusiasm for their material and their gig was always--ALWAYS--infectious. And while one could quibble with some of the choices here in production and instrumentation--Bob Ezrin?; tabla?; flaming Doobie Brothers/""What's Happening"" gong?--it's nice to see that so much of these kids' callow mid-80s magic still comes across."
1,"Don't Buy, Gears slide inside and wheels won't rotate.","Another excuse for ""made in China' and when it works its cool but chances are it won't work fully and it is really frustrating.I had to take the car apart 10 times and fix the minute gears inside for the car to work and I am extremely mechanical. I fixed the car 1/2 hour for 1 minunte of play and it borke again. I do not recommend for anyone who expects a new toy to properly work."
1,Nice material but they don't stay on,"We bought these to keep our dog from slipping and hurting himself on new very slippery hardwood stairs. The fabric is good, but they failed of their essential purpose b/c they simply will not stay on the dog's feet. I don't mean from the dog pulling or chewing on them; the shoes just come off from walking around, no matter how tightly you affix them. There must be a good dog shoe out there -- I know hikers in the Sierra mountains use them for tougher duty than hanging around the house -- but these are not the ones."
3,Black Arctic Boots-Medium,"I was exspecting them to be more then what came in the mail. Is ok for my dogs for short walks on the sidewalk, as for if they are wanting to go on the grass or muddy area be careful because it's all thin fabric except for the little rubber bottoms that slide around the foot."
5,One of my favorites!,"I saw this at a cd store after I got La Traviata and immediately remembered Beverly Sills talking about it in both of her books. I wanted it really badly, and I just got it for my 15th birthday. I love it! When I heard the first few songs, I was unsure about the voices. Then I heard Cassel & Sills, and they were fabulous! Sills is my all-time favorite soprano and this is a great recording of her that I am attempting to expose my friends to. I *highly* recommend it to any Cassel or Sills fan."
1,"opera, or saloon singing?",This is not an opera. So I can only give it one star. Sills is better as Anna Bolena.
1,Blind Boys of Alabama,I can't imagine ordering this cd as........ I don't own ANY gosspel music. If I did order this..... I've never received it. Barbara
2,Norpro Holiday cookie pan,I found it difficult to put the cookie dough into the pan in a way that the cookie would come out with the patterns they were to have. They weren't detailed & really not acceptable. I think this pan would be better for making chocolate figures.
1,Should have listened to previous reviews.,"I read the reviews and thought, ""Oh, I can make it work"". I don't think anyone can make this work. And even if they could, it is easier and faster to roll out dough and use cookie cutters to shape them. I got this for a birthday present just in time for Christmas baking. What a waste of money. I won't tell my daughter (who gave it to me) how disappointed I am but I know she will ask why I didn't use it. Dreading telling her what a bomb it was. Listen to experience, it doesn't work."
1,"No Coherence, Bad Graphics","Not worth a penny. This book is not well prepared. The graphics are very rough and ugly, and not self-explanatory. The author just wrote everything he knew, without even trying to arrange the information into a more readable form."
5,Excellent for a beginner,"As a Novice in data mining I found this book extremely useful. The book describes supporting technologies, data mining techniques and then the directions. Although the book does not go into any technical details such as mathematical reasoning the scope of data mining is clearly explained. I am now really motivated to read the more advanced books in data mining. I would strongly recommend this book for someone who wants to learn about data mining. If you want to learn the algorithms in detail then this is not the book for you."
3,Unclear description,"I bought a nice Sony Ericson Bluetooth headset for my phone and it was delivered on time. The Sony Ericson HBH-660 is a good piece of equipment that reduces noise while you are talking and is decent to hear the person you are talking to.Unfortunately, I was misled be the description which said ""includes Travel Charger"". I paid extra for this item compared to the same item advertised elsewhere without ""includes Travel Charger"". The travel charger was not a car travel charger that I expected, but just a regular A/C adapter for a wall outlet. I paid to much for what I received. Be careful."
4,Very Good,"This has good solutions to the problems, usually of varied type and usually very helpful. The only problem is that on average about 5 or 6 problems are worked out per chapter and it would be nice to have more."
2,Get a warranty,"I had this product for about 4 months before it stopped working. The power wouldn't cut on a lot of the times when I held it down. After about 6 months, it stopped working completely. The unit will not cut on at all.As to the design, it would be nice if it was about an inch slimmer. They also probably could have made the entire unit a bit smaller. The LCD screen was decent, but the radio and CD playback was sub-par. The speakers are at the very rear of the unit and are facing downward. Since this is a unit designed to mount under a cabinet, that doesn't make much sense. There should have at least been a front mounted speaker for the TV."
4,Good TV/VCR/DVD - No Universal Remote works with it though,"I have had my Sylvania TV for over a year now, and have never had a problem with it at all. The picture is nice and crisp, DVD and VCR have not given me any problems, and the sounds quality is quite good. The only problem I havehad at all is that no universal remote (my TiVo and Comcast remotes specifically) seem to work with it. If anyone happens to find a code for it, let me know! I would and do recommend this item."
1,Very Noisy - Screen Bounces - Buy something else!,"We just brought home this TV from Sears, after our 1yr old & 2yr old pulled our 32"" TV off the stand and broke it. We hefted the extremely heavy thing into our house and plugged it in. The first thing we noticed was the loud humming noise that I am guessing the VCR is making (with or without a tape in it). SInce they are all attached you cannot just turn off the VCR, so the loud noise stays on. You have to turn the sound up very high in order to cover up the noise.2nd Problem: We immediately noticed the screen was slightly bouncing. It is especially noticable when words are on the screen.These problems were noticable immediately after we plugged it in, and we are taking it straight back to sears ASAP!Our experience has been horrible with this one, I suggest purchasing a different Unit."
2,"Good picture, but everything else is cheap","This is a really basic TV, with one strange, exotic twist. In spite of NO analog sound outputs on the back, there is a single DIGITAL output--and it only works with the DVD/CD player. If you want to listen to the TV or VCR through your home speakers with an amplifier, you're out of luck. To me, this is a colossal mistake of the highest order. The VCR player is very noisy and slow when accepting a tape, and the CD player fast forward feature is very jerky--no comparison to my 1986 Pioneer 6-disc player smoothness (and I thought technology was improving?!) Don't waste your money. Get a TV that has at least one set of analog RCA outputs on the back. I'm happy to say I didn't waste my money--my wife won this in a radio contest."
3,"Grandes Extros, Iva Zanicchi","Excellant voice, but disappointed, I thought she was singing in Spanish.I reaaly must say, the content is not disappointing , but I have all yhis material in Italian.So Iva, alittle more Spanish please.The Vicaress of Vintage"
5,Family Geneaology Source,"Surprised while reading the book to discover a bit of personal family history included. Subsequently were provided with a copy of a letter from Paul Wellman to a great-granduncle (dated in December 1930) requesting more information from the past. Fascinating reading for the historian, or amateur historian, interested in the history of the U.S. west."
3,Slow and confusing,"I never could get traction in this book. The slow start, combined with what I felt was a confusing similarity in the names of the characters, made for tough going. Eventually it picked up the pace, but by then I had trouble caring. If you enjoy the feel of a ""foreign"" novel, this will probably appeal--there is no doubt the author has captured the sense of living in Seville. But if you want a quick, fast thriller that you can read hungrily, this one isn't for you."
4,Well worth it,Wilson makes up for his complex plots with his willingness to develop each significant character to some degree.He is a terrific writer!
2,Why?,"Did not like this book. Long disjointed story line and not a trace of, ""lets get to the next page""."
4,"Far Superior to ""A Small Death in Lisbon""","I found ""A Small Death in Lisbon"" disappointing, so it was with some trepidation that I began ""The Blind Man of Seville."" The writing here is far superior to Wilson's earlier work. The characters were vivid and the plot compelling. I must say, I enjoyed most everything that the ""mean spirited and spiteful"" reviewer disliked. However, Wilson does need to work on his endings. He sets up several promising scenarios and pursues none of them, opting for something ""completely different"" at the end. I think the ending comes off poorly. But I could not put the book down. A wonderful read."
2,Tonight we do not sleep,"Surprisingly good storyline, refreshing to see a movie without an american cookie-cutter ending, it was quite clever how it was all tied together in the end.However, there is no escape from bad acting (or should I say lack of acting) - and to be honest, the flow of the movie so slow at times that it caused a friend of mine quit watching it in the middle of the movie."
3,Reloj Deportivo,"Funciona muy bien incluso en el agua. La correa no es de buena calidad, pues se manchó al tener contacto con el agua de mar a los pocos días de uso."
3,"Good book, quite difficult/boring to read in places","It is a good book, yet i find that i disagree with the author in many places."
4,Nice set for the money,"Well I am still amazed at the picture in HDTV 1080i; This TV is awesome, for the money, I looked at the Mitsubishi and was impressed as well, howeverThe price tag was much higher. This 52"" unit is the same as the Scenium line without theAdded DVD, etc. On a note I did like the black border around the Scenium but I wasOn a budget. The Scenium models were over 2K. Back to this unit, It truly is nice, theWhite looks as good as a tube set, sitting back watching a HD broadcast takes you into aState of mind that causes your brain to keep saying ""wow"" look at how good this looksThis keeps distracting me from the content of the show... I am just now starting to getOver that shock and can follow along with the program.It has DVI, plus 2 sets of Component inputs and 3 sets of S-Video. You can't go wrong with this set. I sold my 4 year old 4:3 46"" RCA and could never go back!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"At first I thought the RCA D52W20 was an excellent purchase, but over the next few days of ownership I started to notice the many, many flaws that ultimately led to my returning this product after 20 days and buying a Samsung instead.In order of importance, the significant problems with this set are:1) The screen edge regions did not produce a sharp image.2) The convergence needed to be adjusted twice daily as there was a marked drift on both the blue and red projectors.3) There is only 1 (center) manual convergence point. Similar sets from Sony, Toshiba, etc give you 9 points to adjust.4) Ghost streaks appeared to the right of bright objects in high contrast situations.This being said, the RCA generally produced a ""good"" picture, and who really watches the edge of the screen anyway, right? ;-)Bottom line - this set is available at a discount price, but it also delivers discount quality."
3,Technical Support Stinks,"Bought my TV in May. Loved owning it. Then it broke. Found out picture tube had a design flaw in it that allowed fluid to slowly leak onto the circuit board. Turned it on one day and the whole thing just popped and turned off. Circuit board shorted out frying most of the interior. It has been 2 months now and still haven't gotten it fixed. Not the repair guys fault. Thomson Electronics, who is the maker, is taking forever to replace the parts. My repair guy who was recommended by Thomson, said I should just try and get a new TV since most of the parts need to be replaced. Thomson doesn't like that idea. They say itis not their policy. Got off the phone today. May take another 10 days before they even find one of the parts. I will never recommend or buy a Thomson product again. By the way I think they make RCA and Proscan as well. They also settled a class action law suit two years ago in Minn. regarding faulty picture tubes.KP"
1,Stay away from RCA,"I bought this TV about a year and a half ago, and although I was initially impressed with the picture quality of the TV, my TV has been in the shop for a total of 3 months as of this writing. The problem I've had with the TV is quite similar to the one which others have described, where the TV randomly blinks off and on until it finally burns and fizzles out.. I have also seen that it is a serious fire hazard because of this same problem, although I was fortunate enough not to have my set catch on fire. I had purchased a 3-year extended warranty from The Brick, but their service center says that they have tried with no avail to obtain the needed parts from Thomson/RCA. I have tried contacting their customer support department, and they have been nothing but rude and unhelpful. I would not recommend this TV or any other RCA product, unless you enjoy headaches."
1,Worse TV that I have ever owned!,I bought the TV new a year ago. Had it about 4 months when I noticed that the cable connector had come loose. Replaced the TV and the new one did the same thing less than 4 months later. Also had problems with the picture and they had to replace a major component. Guess the TV is designed to be replaced every few months. The picture isn't good enough to warrant the cost! Will not own another RCA product. Good luck with customer service!
4,So far so good,"I just had my TV arrive last week. So far I couldn't be happier. The picture is ok in regular mode and the HDTV picture is outstanding. The look of the TV is very sleak and modern. It has some cool features like PIP and push button recording to your VCR (I have tivo so I wouldn't use that feature). All in all I'm very happy with the TV. Also, I paid just $1050 for it on sale at Circuit City. I think it was mismarked. Can't beat that deal! I just hope it proves to be reliable in the long term."
1,Don't Buy This TV!,They don't have an option for 0 stars. My D40W20 caught fire after 6 months of use. I could see flames inside the cabinet. Dealer/RCA would not take back. I took the TV to service center after fighting with dealer/RCA for a month. I picked up TV after 2 months at repair shop. Now the remote control receiver will not work.Save yourself the hassle. Do not buy this TV under any circumstances.
1,I wish I could give this lower than 1 star...,"The set looked beautiful in the store, so I picked it up. Of course, I neglected to see the open/used/abused models at a discount price placed around the Home Theater section of the store. I go home, plug it in, and what happens? The screen/projector flickers! The color morphs in and out. The color balance, auto tuning, etc. can't do anything to cure the problem. I take it back to (censored store name) and then they told me that about 9/10 of this model get returned to their store for the same reason--HORRIBLE QUALITY! Save your money if you want a bigscreen TV... buy a Toshiba or a Mitsubishi for a long-life tv. Trust me!!!"
4,very pleased,When I recieved my hanging lantern today I noticed a few holes in the shipping box and thought the worst but to my surprise everything was there and nothing was broken. I did not realize this lantern is supposed to be hard wired to a box which I did not want but it was easy to wire a plug on the end and plug it in. It seems to be well made and the chain is very strong. I really can't find anything to complain about and for the price for this one compared to some others it's a no brainer. I would recommend this lantern and will probably get another one.
5,"Gorgeous Lantern, Priced Right","I was recommended this outdoor lantern by a blog writer I read, she used it as an indoor light and I loved the idea. I now have this lantern hanging in my entryway and LOVE it. I love the look of it, I love the price I got it for. The same lantern goes for $49.99 at target, I got it from Amazon for $18.43! Can't beat that! It arrived right on time, in perfect condition, was easy to install and looks gorgeous in my entryway! I definitely recommend this product!"
1,received BROKEN,"Parts of this lantern was broken when I received it. I am not sure if UPS is to blame, or if it was the way it was shipped..the box was in a much bigger box with no foam peanuts or materials for ""cushion"", but I was very disappointed that it needed repair or would have had to be returned.1. One of the glass panes had broken where it goes into a groove of black plastic and had fallen out of the lantern and tiny glass pieces were in the box. It was a small part, so it was possible to glue it into the groove.2. The pot metal frame that this is made from was very cheap and a corner of it was broken. I used jb weld for it. I find it very inconvenient to return something, especially by mail, so I will normally find a way to repair it before going that route and that is what I did in this instance. Which is lucky for me, because when I pulled up my order information, there was no option to contact them and my route would have been going through amazon or UPS."
4,NICE LANTERN,"SINCE THE CHAIN LENGTH WAS NOT LISTED FOR THIS PRODUCT, I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER FIRST TO VERIFY, I WAS TOLD 6' TO 8'. WHEN I RECEIVED IT, THE CHAIN AND CORD WERE ONLY 2'. ANOTHER CALL TO THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY ARE SENDING ADDITIONAL CHAIN. THE LAMP IS QUITE NICE, ALTHOUGH IT STATES 19"" IT IS SMALLER, AND IT APPEARS SMALLER THAN ON THE SITE, PERHAPS DUE TO THEIR DEPICTION WITH A SMALLER THAN STANDARD BULB. FROM THE BOTTOM EDGE TO THE TOP OF THE RING MEASURES APPROXIMATELY 14"". THE SWEDISH IRON IS SIMILAR TO AN AGED OR DISTRESSED NICKEL. I'VE SEEN THIS LAMP ON OTHER SITES THAN AMAZON PRICED SIMILARLY OR UP TO $20 MORE, BUT NEVER FOR LESS."
4,Trans Globe hanging lantern,"This item was made for outdoors, but I liked the style, so I modified to use indoors,over our sink and works just fine."
2,Trans Globe Lighting,item was advertised as 19 inches tall. it's actually much smaller- about 13 inches. too small for what we needed. can't speak to the quality or operation of the light since we never hooked it up.
2,Size does matter,"This fixture looks just like the picture but is discribed as 19 inchs tall, I must have gotten the pediatric version because its only 12 inchs tall. They must have been measuring the chain and fixture together. Would look good on a very small porch, but on my 20 foot long porch it looks cheap. Buyer beware of discrption."
4,dramatic opera,"this cd set of the opera was bought used, it has two or three blips on it but basically mplays thru ok and i have no complaints"
5,"Girl, this is one Stupendous Lucia","The first of Sutherland's Lucias and really the superior one. Honey, if you don't fall right smack on your face when you hear the amazing, spectacular mad scene, you're probably deaf. Girl, this is fabulous."
1,Horrible,"This amateur DVD was badly made. It's overpriced considering the quality and a waste of money. If anyone gives it a good rating, they're probably in the video."
2,Description of Color is Misleading,"Amazon misleadingly describes the color of this set of dishes as ""Pantine Green,"" and the photograph shows items that appear to be a bluish-green. This is completely false. Be forewarned that the color is in no way green - it is a light, dusty blue. I ordered two sets, and when they arrived I was disappointed that they don't match my decor, since the dishes are baby blue and my other stuff is green and gold. So I am returning them, which is going to cost me almost as much as the dishes themselves cost, since each set weighs about 25 pounds. (Amazon is charging me for the cost of return shipping since they say the return is ""not their error""!!!) The shape and size of the dishes seemed acceptable - they are your typical stoneware with some faux-distressing to give them that French provincial, flea-market find look."
5,Great set,Love the dishes. Great color and great size for the bowls and the plates. Bought two sets!!
4,"Wonderful set, but cup handles not large enough...","I ordered two sets, one in green and one is white, because I like the mixed and matched look. The cups are large, but the handles are very small even for small hands. The rest of the set is great...very sturdy and large."
2,Bad shipping,"I did like the way the plates looked, but I ordered a set of the square and the round, and they both came with demolished boxes and lots of broken dishes. Amazon paid to ship them back, but repacking them was not fun. I didn't want to risk another order, I'll look for something local."
1,No fleur-de-lis,"These dishes are everything they say they are EXCEPT the embossed pattern does not in any way, shape, or form resemble a fleur-de-lis, but rather looks much like a scorpion or bug, complete with a body and legs. The smaller pattern in between the insects resembles a marijuana leaf. So...if you want to impress guests with bugs and pot leaves on your serveware this is the set for you."
5,definite must-see about Burma,"I saw this movie at SXSW last year, and it really interested me because my mom and her side of the family is from Burma. I knew that there were problems going on in Burma, but I wasn't really familiar with any more details regarding the problems. Watching the footage made me feel as though I was watching something that I wasn't allowed to watch, and I wanted everybody to watch and learn what was going on in Burma. Everybody should be able to record and document what is going on in life, and I really appreciate Anders stergaard going out and making a film about the problems in Burma.After watching the movie, I felt so much more educated about the subject. I wanted to learn more about it, and I wanted my mom and the rest of my huge family to watch it. I told everyone about it, and it was definitely my favorite documentary at SXSW 2009...and probably of the whole year. I'm so glad that it received an Oscar nomination, and I really think it should have won."
3,I like to get my videos on discs.,"I guess I'll get used to it, but having this film on my computer is not as convenient as having it on a portable disc. I plan to download it myself."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!,I won't give away any of the story because I wouldn't want to ruin it but all I can say is buy this book. You won't be disappointed. Just don't bring it to work with you because you won't get any work done. I couldn't put this book down!!!!! Congratulations Amaleka and can't wait for your next one. :-)
5,Future Classic,"I had the opportunity to read this book and could not put it down. As a reader, you immediately developed a strong connection with the various characters. You feel sorry for Myra and her hard life, you feel bitter hate for Milton and you love Quanda because she is the ultimate friend. This is a classic urban story with lots of twists. Two thumbs up."
5,This album rocks! Can't wait 'till their next one!!,"These guys are great. They seem to have it down. Their melodies and harmonies are tight, the drums are amazing and the lyrics are also great. I have seen these guys live and they put on a great show. Be looking for their second album later this year probably."
5,"Extrememly Good, to Say the Least","This album is too good to be passed up. Every song kicks, and as the other guy said, it has some really cool melodies. And it's really hard to find, so buy it!!!!"
5,It owns...,"I saw these guys live at the Byron Bay Blues & Roots Festival in Byron Bay Australia in 2000, and they are just sick.Bought the disc and i have never stopped listening to it. Highly recommended."
1,"""A Little Short""",The book has only 67 pages not 124 pages as listed. If you don't include the index or the diagrams it's considerably shorter. I checked with the publisher. They were originally going to publish in a different format (5 x 7).
5,"Wonderful, deep, incredible book.","I just read a review in which someone said ""The Ice Queen Stinks""...I can not for the life of me believe that...from now on in I'm not going to be able to trust another review. This book is so beautiful. And more so, because my father died two years ago and sometimes when I see a butterfly, especially a Monarch, I know it's him.I also feel sad for the person who didn't finish this book, because the end was incredible and it's where you start really caring about the characters (esp. the main character). I think Hoffman intended on making the main character not very likable, because she (the main character) didn't like herself. Anyway...10 stars, in my opinion."
4,It's about living,"Fairy tales about life and death and cheating both are the basis for this book, I think. I'm not sure and I don't think I want to know for sure. I found myself just enjoying the story as I was pulled through the lives of the characters. Bizarre and unusual yet identifiable. Not my kind of book, but I loved it. Not my style of writing, but who cares when the story line is good. So many novels written these days are long on prose and short on story telling. Not this gem. Enjoy!"
4,"Tough, but good, read","This is an interesting book. I can't say I enjoyed reading it, but I'm certainly glad I did. The outlook for much of the book is so bleak, that I found myself wanting to stop reading. On the other hand, the writing and story were captivating, I couldn't stop. Definitely a book that makes you think, but mostly about things you try to avoid thinking about. So it's probably a pretty healthy thing to pick up."
5,Alice Hoffman at her best,"If you've read and loved Alice Hoffman's other books, do not miss this one. I am not going to rehash the plot but will quote a line from the book ""...filled with stories that feel illogical and true at the very same time."" If you are a Hoffman fan, you will love this book. If you are not a Hoffman fan, give it a try. It's magical in a way that will make you think and laugh and cry."
2,The Ice Queen was a huge disappointment,"Well, try as I might, it looks like I will never be an Alice Hoffman fan! This book was nothing but complete drudgery. I stuck with it, assuming it would get better. But it never did. Interesting premise, but never delivered. There is little to say other than the main character was extremely flat and not at all likable or sympathetic. I'm done with Alice Hoffman."
2,Disappointing,"I usually enjoy Hoffman's books. This one wasn't awful and was unlike a story I have read before (narrator being struck by lightning). But, it didn't draw me in quite the way some of her other books have."
2,As exciting as watching ice melt.,"I am a big Alice Hoffman fan, but I just did not connect with this one. I found the main character too self-pitying and self-centered. I made it halfway through and then realized I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to force myself to finish. If you are new to Hoffman, I recommend trying one of her other novels first, such as Practical Magic, Here on Earth, or River King."
2,Fizzled,I listened to this book on my Ipod. It was narrated by Nancy Travis and I believe that is 80% of the reason I finished the book. Because I do not want to prolong the agony I will give you a one liner: For a book centered around people who were struck by lightning: it fizzled. . . . .
2,What happened to my Alice?,"I could not believe that Alice Hoffman wrote this book - it was graceless, dark and depressing -- and just plain weird. The main character was one-dimensional and the plot was deadly boring. There was way too much strange stuff going on that does not deserve to be called ""magic realism"", for which she is famous. And it rambled on and on......I have been a fan of this author's since forever, it seems, and read every book of hers. I have not loved every one, but none have disappointed me as much as this one. I had to struggle to finish it.Oh, well, I guess she cannot please me all the time!"
2,The Ice Queen,"I am a Hoffman fan, but not of this. A dull dark story which did nothing for a pragmatist. I was bored."
2,Kritters Ramblings,"A book that flowed like a stream consciousness - which unfortunately I wasn't a fan of. The story overall was intriguing, but because of the writing style, it wasn't my favorite.The use of strong adverbs made me fall in love with her descriptions of the ""effects"" of lightning strike survivors. I adored the relationship between the brother and sister and how the early death of their mother affected the both of them in two totally different ways. But through these likes, I still had a hard time reading and enjoying this one.I would only recommend this book to those who love things that are artsy. Imagery and visualization would be key when reading this book."
3,Maybe I Picked the Wrong Book,"This is my first time reading this author, I bought this book from a library booksale. The cover caught my attention (love butterflies) but after reading the back cover, I thought it would be a good book. It was just ok for me and I was pretty much at the end before I realized what I was reading if that makes sense. It isn't memorable at all for me. Maybe I will try another of her books..any suggestions?"
3,"Ice Queen, women","ALice Hoffman, gets your interest in the first sentence,""Becareful what you wish for,"" This novel holds your interest but overall I found it be slightly not rememerable, the ending with your brother was perfect,but I would not recommend this book for people who have never felt true pain, or they will not understand, what was trying to be portayed thoughout the novel."
4,Look forward to reading other reviews........,There are few writers as powerful as Alice Hoffman. Her imagery is exquisite; her characters are unforgettable. Another look into the imagination of a master storyteller. I find myself looking at the color red as I never had before.
3,Not so memorable...,I don't know why but I became increasingly bored towards the end of this book...I almost didn't finish it...but I really hate to not finish books. I guess I need to be hit by lightening in order to relate to these characters. :-) The most intriguing thing about the story was that she was a librarian who snooped around in confidential records...not something a proper librarian would do. I liked her cat Giselle.
2,Weak book....,"Honestly, I am shocked by all the positive reviews! The main, lame character has so many epiphanies...that the book was anti-climactic at best. Pure fantasy....which is OK...but it was DUMB fantasy. Glad I bought it at a thrift store because it was only worth the quarter I spent."
2,Not my thing....,"Too predictable and unrealistic and to make matters worse, it's ""Danielle Steele lite."" Was shocked to read the interview in the back pages where Alice Hoffman says she is very analytical in real life but does not write that way. I wish she would write that way. I don't know how she can write differently than she is. But ... I guess she writes what she knows will sell and her readers seem to love her. Not for me, though."
3,A narrator with no name,"The main character is distant, cold and uninteresting. At the beginning you feel sympathy. The wish and then death of a mother. Tragic. But there is nothing to like until she is hit by lightening and explores the world. The book is not long and therefore can capture your attention but to come away satisfied was not what I felt at the finish."
4,A fairy tale,"I am a big fan of Alice Hoffman's books. I have read almost every one of them.I really liked ""The Ice Queen"", but it is not my favourite by her. (That is ""Blackbird House: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)"").The story is so filled with loss and suffering, and yet there is hope and love to find where it is not expected to be found.Hoffman is a master when it comes to describing the average person that experiences an most unusual destiny.If you like books that are challenging and different, then this is the book you should read."
4,Great Story; Wished it wouldn't end!,"This book is amazing. Alice Hoffman has done it once again. This is an easy read, but it's hard to put down. I was so into the story, it was so hard for me to accept it was over. I definitely would recommend this book to everyone who wants an interesting tale of love and loss. =]"
3,fairy tale for adults,"Much like the the dark fairy tales that the main character loved as a child, the plot here is simple and based on big themes,usually in appositon, and not subtle. The ice queen is so cold that she can feel nothing until she is struck by lightning. Then she meets another lightning-strike victim who has become a human furnace,and he melts her heart. Death shows up in various forms in the novel almost like a recurring character but in the end the ice queen chooses to focus on life, becoming a doting godmother to her neice and wedding the man she once rejected because he showed too much feeling.The plot is simple and the main character is too one dimensional to make this a very compelling novel, but if you think of it as a fairy tale, it works, largely because of the quality of the writing."
5,An original masterpiece,"I love this book. It is original and satisfying and tells/asks of life's meaning, redemption, and appreciating the here and now. It's about love, healing, beauty and magic. Many parts surprised me and yet I felt that Hoffman remained true to her story and weaved together all the parts to make for a satisfying finish (something that I'm finding that is difficult for many authors to pull off). The first few chapters are very dark and I was tempted to stop reading because I don't always enjoy spending so much of my mental energy with that hanging in my consciousness. Nevertheless, as I read on, the story got more intriguing and then took on an entirely different tone towards the end. This book is difficult to describe but it is well worth your time if you enjoy a well-crafted read about making a meaningful life."
2,The Ice Queen,I have loved all of Alice Hoffman's books until I tried to read this one. It failed to keep my intrest and was so confusing. It was a disappointment.
3,I'd like to be able to finish this book,Started to read this book and ended up lending it to a fellow Book Club member who was going to visit relatives back East. Didn't get the book back so I never did get to finish it. If I ever have any spare time I may get it from the Libraryl.
5,My Favorite Book!,I read this book about twice a year. Love it. I finally bought it for keeps. Buy it! You will love it.
2,Plot Left Me Ice Cold,"This was my first Alice Hoffman book. The language and style was beautiful. She obviously has a way with words. However, the plot left my saying ""That's it?"" I found it, as one other reviewer said, very one dimmensional. I think she had an original idea for the book, but it never felt fully developed."
3,Interesting Idea but narrative doesn't deliver,"Hoffman is one of my favorite storytellers - I love the weaving of seemingly everyday magical elements into her character's lives. Though the premise of the book is very promising and interesting, the main female character fell flat. I couldn't identify with her and ultimately became annoyed each time she made a reference to what she ""deserved, being an unfeeling woman"". I didn't like her, and though I understood the feelings Hoffman was trying to convey, I didn't care how it turned out for this character. It comes around a bit in the end, but I'd definitely recommend ""The River King"" over this book any day."
4,Dwell...awesome song.,"Track 1, Dwell, is a worship song that is innovative, inspired, and it is reason enough to buy this CD. However, I thought Dwell was an average album overall. The impact and inspired quality of the song Dwell is never revisited. Granted, the presence of God's Word is essential, and is fulfilled in Dwell, but after hearing track 1, I just expected more musically than what was delivered. I expected more after Vineyard albums like Beautiful or Hungry. Vineyard had an opportunity to create a revolutionary album with Dwell, but fell short by re-entering the land of regurgitated, uninspired fluffy slow songs and power-pop riffs which are staples of of the unfortunate Worship Album Bandwagon.Some highlights on Dwell:DWELLMORE THAN EVERLOVE ME LIKE YOU DOYOU SO LOVED THE WORLDMY SECURITYIf you get the CD/DVD combo, you get resources galore, which is an awesome add-on to most any Vineyard CD."
4,An inspiration piece!,"This was an excellent book- entertaining and easy to follow. However, Hip Home Ec left much to be desired. It's kinda hard to explain. If you are already remotely crafty, the recommendations are relatively dull. If you haven't done any crafts, the ""how-to"" steps are not very helpful. Personally, I was looking for a fun book to get me in a crafting mood and this worked great. I am now inspired, but unfortunately I need to buy another book to find something to do."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"This book inspired me to be crafty in so many areas of my life. It's not just about ""making stuff"" - it's about having an overall attitude of creating a nice life, even if you don't have much to start with. I really enjoyed reading about the author's own life and how she was inspired by friends and family members. I highly recommend this refreshing book for those who would like to make a positive change."
2,Total lack of pictures..,"It's a craft book, so I expected pictures of all the wonderful crafts I would be soon making myself! If you are like me and would prefer pictures to help you visualize your end product.. this book is not for you. I honestly haven't done anything from the book just due to this fact.. It may be amazing and really helpful, but I really need the pictures!"
3,Mighty skimpy...,"As much as I hate all the reviews on Amazon that are wierd personal responses and not true ""reviews,"" I feel strongly about this one. I went to a bookstore to buy the book and didn't buy it because it was so SMALL. There is not much book for the money here. If you don't live on a teeny salary in New York City, knock yourself out! It seemed perfectly charming..."
1,This Book Is Lame!,I got this book hopeing for something different. 80% of this book is knitting stuff. You can only knit so much! I was very disapointed. (Who wants to knit a bikini?)
3,Optimistic & Slightly Disappointed,"When selecting this model, it seemed to have everything. My initial interest was the diversity of disc types, including ability to view JPEG photos. It plays DVD's just fine, however, I have found some older audio CD's that would occasionally skip. This could have been due to the quality of the CD. The JPEG files that I downloaded from my computer to a disc do work, but seem painfully slow in a wipe-down display. Everything hooked up easily to my other equipment and that was a plus. Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase."
1,One year later; looking for a new DVD player!,"This DVD player was a dissapointment from the beginning. It has always skipped and paused with DVD playback. Now, one year into it's life and just past the warranty dates, the tray will no longer close completely and it does not recognize any discs. My advise would be to keep looking."
2,"I think he left himself down, not Jesus.",Some artists songs are all good some are all junk. Then you tke ole fatso Cessna and his tunes are great or junk. Maybe D Edwards can give em some tips.
3,Introduction to the Worlds Oceans,"It is a text book for college, what more can I say? I got exactly what I ordered.I hope I can sell it after the semester."
2,zzzzz,This was the most boring book ever and I can't believe I had to buy it only to read one or two chapters.
5,Review of Intro to World's Oceans,"I'm so glad I bought this book on-line. It is in excellent shape for a used textbook. It suprised that the condition is like new. I paid about 1/4 of the cost that the college bookstore wanted, and also found out that the college won't be using this book next semester, so it was an excellent purchase all around. The book itself is a keeper. I'm only taking Oceanograpy because it's a college requirement for a science, but the book is full of information that I would like to have on hand, so I'll probably keep it. Lots of great pictures, too."
2,Won't work for long!,"When I first got this rain gauge, I got it to work relatively quickly. Don't count on it working very long or with much of a range. Your gauge better be close to the house, because the wireless transmission won't go far. The manual is darn near useless, not because you can't understand it, but because the buttons will gradually lose some of their functions until you can no longer reset the total rainfall, can no longer access some functions, etc. The gauge itself is somewhat poorly constructed as well, making changing the batteries a real chore that requires a jewelers screwdriver and disassembling the entire device. Two stars only because it will work (for a while) right out of the box. Eventually, it will become a one star product."
3,"Very good, but not excellent.","Il Trittico is not generally regarded as Puccini's greatest work.Tebaldi is not in top form, though her singing is sufficiently dramatic. The sound quality is not excellent, although it is good. Overall, it's a fine choice if you want a recording of this work, but I wouldn't call it a ""must"" for any collection except major Puccini or Tebaldi fans."
3,The Emperor versus the Indian.,"I found this book very similar in material to Gene Smith's earlier book Maximilian and Carlotta. I think Ridley followedthe same context as Smith, and threw in a little more material onJuarez. So, if you have read one of these books, don't read the other.Overall, it presents the conflict between the Conservatives andLiberals and Maximilian and Juarez correctly. It poses Maximilian as heroic and wrong headed while Juarez is portrayed as stubborn and single minded. Both needed more analization to portray them correctly. The book was very readable."
1,Decitful!,"I plucked this book from the shelf of my local library because it sounded funny and intriguing. Nowhere NOWHERE in the book blurb did it state that the book was about a gay man! NOWHERE!!!!!!! I figured what the heck I'll try reading it anyhow. Well, after about 30 pages I gave up. Why? It wasn't funny. I selected the book because it was supposed to be funny - nope. Not a giggle, not a chuckle - nana. I still wonder why they hid the fact that the main character was gay. I'd never heard of the author so how could I know? Well, I know the name now and sure won't bother picking up another boring book by him - gay character or not."
2,"Wow, I hate just about all of these people.","It's hard for me to get in to a book without finding something likable or at least ""interesting-to-the-point-of-overriding-dislike"" in regards to the characters. My big problem with ""Alternatives"" was that I hated all the damn people in it. McCauley's skill as a writer--which is quite solid--could not save this book for me, and the only reason I finished it was because I had enjoyed other books he has written before and since this one. (It's almost as if I finished it out of spite. ""THERE, I've finished your DAMN BOOK! Happy now?!"")While the prose was pleasing in and of itself, the two dimensional, unaware characters schlepping through this muddled, drawn out story was a waste of my time. Some books I keep forever. Others get donated to friends or the library. This one went in the recycle bin."
2,"Oddly, I borrowed this book...","right along with De Beauvoir's ""The Mandarins"". A complete coincidence. But it didn't keep me from putting McCauley's book down halfway through. I wondered if the narrator would do anything besides continue to break his celibacy vow and pass endless judgement on his fellow 2-dimensional characters. Very light reading that wasn't the guilty pleasure I was expecting."
2,Where is this going?,"The author's other books I've read were fantastic. This one, however, was disappointing. I was three quarters of the way through and I realized nothing happened yet. It was well written, held my attention well enough for the most part, but towards the end I was bored to tears."
2,a good albeit light read,"I heard a radio commentator highly recommend this book.She said that it took place in Boston, gave loads of information about the city and about the real estate business. Well, the information on both is sketchy at best. This book is an easy read for a rainy afternoon. I was a bit disappointed however. I thought that it would be more substantial."
2,Disappointed,"I absolutely adore Stephen McCauley's early work. The Easy Way Out still makes me laugh out loud, so I eagerly awaited the release of this most recent work. I was in a word -disappointed. The work seemed strained and in many parts did not keep my attention. I just did not enjoy reading this knowing what the author is capable of. I kept hoping it would get better. It did not."
3,"Enjoyable, yet","This was a breezy, witty read, one full of funny insights and well drawn characters. So why was it such a drag to read? One reason could be that there wasn't really a plot. We enter William Collins life just as he's swearing off sex, which lasts as long as this sentence. So why start there at all? Collins is standoffish and droll. His other gay friends are just catty. There isn't any real tension or conflict in the book, it's just witty, droll William giving us his witty, droll thoughts on everything from smokers to yoga to real estate to parties to dogs and on and on. It gets tiring."
5,"Fun, Different","A fun, rather short story as anime goes. Good character development, good animation. Could have used a little work on technical accuracy."
2,I would rate it 5 starts if...,"The idea is great. But the materials this booster seat is made of can't be good to breathe in for anybody, esp. kids. It smells hurrendous. I aired it outside for a lot of hours - it didn't help. I put it out in the garage. It still smells horrible after a week. I am planning on writing to the manufacturer to request some info on the materials this seat was made of.Update: after more than a year this seat is still smells unbearable. I contacted Eddie Bauer with the question about the materials and they couldn't help me."
3,Very good idea but there is area of improvement,"I bought this years ago for my one-year old son back then. It was a good idea and we even traveled with this booster oversea. I remember the folding was easy and compact. However, after using it for four months (not extensively used, only when we ate out and we didn't eat out that often), the middle part of the booster seat fell inward. My son was not a heavy baby. So I ended up sticking two table soysauce size bottles underneath the seat just to have a good support for my son to sit. This way worked but hassles. What was the point to carry two additional bottles when this booster was supposed to provide convenience in the first place? I am not sure whether this product has been improved over the past few years, but based on the experience I had just said, I don't think I will buy it again for my second baby."
5,Eddie Bauer Pop-Up Seat,This pop-up seat is great for at the table or on the go. My one-year old loves it! It sits him up a lot higher at the table than if we use the high chair at the table. It is so convenient to take places where we know there won't be somewhere for him to sit. It's great for restaruants too because he is very wiggly and it keeps him seated and he's comfortable in it unlike those restaraunt highchairs!
5,Soundtrack to the Apocalypse,"This is one of the albums I'd like to shoot into space so future alien races will understand why we even bothered making music. I got this CD a few years ago and every time I play it I'm stunned at how good it is. Why don't more people know about this band? All the so called ""goth metal"" fans should be swooning in ectasy over Madder Mortem, yet very few people are aware of them. In a perfect world they'd be recognized for the freakin' geniuses they are, but in the real world I guess they aren't too marketable. The lead singer doesn't have a ""pretty"" voice and none of the songs are about shagging, so most humans will never hear this album. That's a real shame. If your tasts are outside the main stream and you don't mind dark, bleak (and I mean BLEAK) music then you need to give this CD a try. It's an aquired tast but well worth the effort. I could go on and on about all the good points of this album but that would be boring and take up too much space. Just buy it!"
1,Buyers Beware,"I am reviewing this company's product to warn all potential buyers to be warned. I order a Turducken from Cajun Stuff on December 2,2005, to be delivered on December 22,2005. They very promptly debited my credit account for 114.95, but never sent my Turducken. I called them once on December 22 and twice on December 23, all 3 calls promised to get back to me with a status, but never did. I called again on December 26 for a refund. I was informed it would be processed on the following day. I never received my refund. Buyers beware!"
5,A Home Haunter's Must-Have,This book is a home haunter's must-have in their library. The author covers every detail when a home haunter wants to change from a private display to a professional haunt. The book arrived in mint condition.
3,Acceptable,"My kids thought they tasted awful. (Which is strange, as they love gummy vitamins.) They are quite pricey & have a strange consistancy. *I* liked them (the taste)... my kids couldn't get past the ""feel""... If you've tried Gerber's graduates Fruit snacks.. these taste very similar... Great alternative for those on the GFCF diet... I wouldn't buy them again..."
2,They Just Aren't Very Good,"I purchased these because I'm a vegetarian who loves gummi bears. These are vegetarian, which is good, but they're not good. They're basically just fruit snacks but with a bad texture. Save your money."
5,Yummy Gummy!,These are good gummi bears. The texture of them are a little different but they flavor is good and they aren't horrible for you.
1,would not order again.,we did not like these at all. my kids refuse to eat them and so i try to pass them off to neighbors and they havent really liked them either. things we did find that are a healthier and still tasty option are clif kids twisted roped and fruitaBu (any flavor).
2,Yuck,"If you want delicious Organic Vegan gummy bears go for the Surf Sweets ""Fruity Bears"" instead they are delicious. These are hard and fairly tasteless in comparison"
5,A wonderful book,"""I was born wise,"" says Sophia, and this is true. She is also a very sincere person, and it makes this book even more wonderful to read.This book is based on numerous interviews with Sophia Loren and her family. It almost like you hear her telling her own story of her life and success.Anyway this is more than just a biography, this is a source of wisdom."
1,I give this 0 stars,Don't waste your money on this product. It's terrible. It is way too complicated to set up and didn't work. I had 2 people who are technicians try to set it up for me and they both told me it's an inferior product. It's pretty expensive for something that doesn't even work.
1,I give this 0 stars,Terrible product. Didn't work. Waste of money. Too complicated to set up. There has to be a better product out there than this one.
4,call some one when in need,"i am a medical supply retailer ,& i have sold about 7 of these units.They are very reliable,easy to program.you can just program one tel #.to ring your care givers cell phone in the middle of the night,& ofcourseby turning the 911 switch on the paramedics will also respond.I like this unit better than the gurdian alert which only calls the911.the pendant is too big & heavy i understand its a two way radio.so buttom line is if you dont want the paramedic to be your first responsethen get the teleemergency pro 700c.There is no monthly fee.drawback is not being waterproof."
2,How do you change the battery in the pendant?,"This product does work. I know because my mother activated it by accident and was surprised when the National Guard, Fire Department and State Police arrived. It was difficult to program and my sister and I agonized over the manual when we set it up for our mother. We didn't want to to alarm the world. Well a year has gone by and a GREEN led is showing that the battery is low. GREEN means bad, RED means okay.... huh? Anyway the useless manual does not explain how to take apart the pendant to replace the 12 volt alkaline battery. It tells how to how replace the 9 volt battery backup which is incredibly obvious. I pried the unit apart just to the point of breaking it and backed off in fear of watching some spring or gizmo shoot across the room. I can see the battery lurking in the bowels of the pendant... so close yet so unreachable. Anyone have some ideas? we have a call in to the manufacturer."
2,"Absolutely ZERO Customer support, NO response!","I bought one for my mother. Seems well made, appears to function perfectly. BUT, my mother damaged the remote with water. I've emailed the company THREE times requesting information about ordering a replacement pendant and I've never received any kind of reply.I would not recommend this product to anyone, due to an absolute lack of response to a customer request."
3,Mixed emotions,"The Telemergency is definitely useful for peace of mind. However, it is really hard to program. It should be water proof so that elderly people don't have to take it off when bathing, which is when many of them fall. I still would recommend it because it's affordable and it does what it says it does."
1,Telemergency unit,"Ordered this unit for my elderly mother. She fell and laid on the floor for 3 hours The wireless Pendant did not work. I called the company and was charged for a second Wireless Pendant . When we tested the unit with the new Wireless Pendant. It did not work either. I ended up sending the Telemergency unit back and was creadited for the unit but not for the wireless pendant. I did all this to keep my mother from paying a monthly fee but we have gone back to the hospital unit for 30 dollars monthly, At least that one works."
1,Doesn't cover all,The unfortunate thing with this item is that it CANNOT be worn in the shower...their paperwork does not say that! Where is a Senior in more danger of slipping and falling then in the shower...POOR coverage!
1,Think Twice! If you've had a lobotomy!,"Imagine you ordered a book thinking it would be a clever""ice breaker"" for your swinging parties. Now imagine, afterfive minutes of reading it to your unsuspecting party guests, they runscreaming because of the uninspired, banal, insultingly simplisticquestions posed by authors Bret Nicholaus and Paul Lowrie. Nowconsider, what should be done with this book after you've wasted yourhard earned money? A) use it to line your birdcage.... B) use it fortarget practice....THINK TWICE! What, these options aren'tchallenging or creative enough for you? Well, welcome to the world of""Think Twice"". The only thing that has some readersthinking twice, is HOW DID THIS BOOK EVER GET PUBLISHED????"
1,Infuriating characters,"I cannot believe the good reviews this book got! I don't think I have ever disliked both the hero and heroine this much in a book and this was a first for me. He is a shallow, [...] and she has no spine!One minute she come across as sensible and the next minute she seems to have no self-control. I am half-way through this book and not sure if I want to finish. Will NOT ever read a Patricia wadell book again."
5,A clever title and a great new series,"I really enjoyed this book. It's a fast paced read and has gooddialog, humor, and romance...By the way, the reviewer who wrote 3/29/04 that she didn't understand the title as it had no connection with the storyof the book OBVIOUSLY did not read the whole book...it's quiteclever and interesting to discover why the gentleman says no...I'm looking forward to ""He Said Now"" later this summer. Wonder what the book after that will be titled??"
5,aged bronze door knobs,"The door knobs were exactly as picture, and they arrived in a timely manner. They were super easy to install, and the aged bronze finish was just perfect."
4,Can't complain,Its a door knob.. It serves its purpose and doesn't fall off. Easy to install. What more can I really say?
5,Better separately than in the `Ring Box',"WagnerDie WalkureSir Georg Solti(London/Decca - Digitally mastered - 1984 CD version)Solti's Ring is magnificent and worthy of a Sixth Star, however, it is better to buy Das Rheingold, Die Walkure, Siegfreid, and Gotterdammerung all separately in their 1984 versions as the complete box versions created a slight pitch problem in some of the discs when they were reproduced.Note: some reviews on this page are for a very different set. When buying this set used, make sure from seller that you are getting the Solti version of Die Walkure."
5,Caring Habits of the Month.,"This book is an expansion of the great Caring Habbit of the Month Adventures. The book is one we all can learn from. I look forward to passing this book along to others, just like I pass the Caring Habits of the Month themes along. The information is simple to process, makes a lot of sense and most of all, makes you feel good inside."
1,Hmmm........,"I was expecting something original and unique; instead I found this book wordy and simplistic. I find it hard to believe the claims made. I don't think this will rival ""Chicken Soup."""
1,Hmmmm.........,I was expecting something new and original. Instead it was too simplistic and wordy. I find it difficult to believe that this program can change the world! It tries to do too much in too many different areas.
1,"didn't watch it, but","i didn't even see it, but i have been waiting for the wonder years complete series forever. how can we encourage them to finally do it? it is one of the most moving and true shows tv has ever seen. do it!!!"
1,What is going on!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?,"Where is the boxset of this series?I want the complete seasons on DVD available right now.I want it yesterday..i wanted it last year.What is going on? Whats taking so long?Somebody get the ball rolling on this project already, i cant take this anticipation any longer."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this DVD expecting various episodes which were together the best of the Wonder Years. What I found was 70 minutes of dissapointment. The first dissapointment was that there was only 70 minutes of footage. The second dissapointment was that this was actually made up of 1 highlights episode and the series finale. Don't get me wrong, the finale was great, but not what I considered a 'best' episode however they did not exactly go to any trouble to edit some great Wonder Years moments and instead just put a highlight episode on there..as I said, not exactly what I expected"
3,"Great Show, Fair DVD","The visual side of all The Wonder Years DVDs are certainely good enough for the average viewer. The audio, however, for some reason does not contain the original WG Snuffy Walden score music. I'm sure it had something to do with licensing but its very unfortunate. The original score was so seamless and powerful, I hated to see a cheesey replacement used instead. Maybe someday we'll have a newly remastered entire series on DVD like we finally go for My So-Called Life."
1,profrom dover,"If you loved this series as I did,do NOT buy unless you see in top of add EVERYTHING that is listed.I did not,to my sorrow,and got one lonely episode in lousy condition for 200.00.Also,laserlight is not a bootleg,but they are fly by night.Quality terrible.Wait till box sets are available.You might petition the producers of this terrific series to make them ready."
1,'EXTREMELY' -- OVER -- PRICED,THE BEST OF THE WONDER YEARS IS JUST A TITLE FOLKS!!! BUYER BEWARE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE EPISODE AND IT IS ONLY THE FINAL ONE!!!
3,Come on already!,"Where are the box sets of this show? The Wonder Years is one of the finest sitcoms of the 80's (and probably of all time). So where is the complete series on DVD? My god, Full House and Punky Brewster is available on DVD. I just saw the first season of Full House yesterday, and the Wonder Years can't get properly released? The Wonder Years touched so many people with it's heartwarming stories, excellent acting, and brilliant writing. The show captured growing up in a way that no television series has ever done before. So do the show and the fans justice, by giving us the Wonder Years, the COMPLETE series on DVD. In the meantime I will be waiting..."
2,Stay away from this one....,"The highlights episode dragged on a bit - definately not the best moments of The Wonder Years, and the picture quality on this was really dissapointing -- you could get similar quality from recording reruns of The Wonder Years onto a VCR."
3,Wonder about this DVD?,"Other viewers are right...appears to be grainy and transfered from video tape. Surely slapped together by some third-rate post house. You do get the final episode in it's complete form but the highlights do little in explaining the series to the unfamiliar. However, seeing this series once again more than makes up for the faults. If you grew up in the sixties, went to school, met a girl and held a job this show will do more for bringing back all the emotions, feelings, sights, sounds, and wonder of that era and make you wish you were still wondering all over again..."
1,Come On! .....,"I am still in disbelief that after so many years The Wonder Years Box Set is not available. It is an absolute timeless CLASSIC. This show became a part of many families and together we grew up. The show is a part of our childhood and should be made available to the public, who embraced the show soooo many nights.I also find it to be a very unproductive business move to prolong the release of this fantatsic series. The amount of people that would rush to get a copy would be unbelievable. The people who connected with the show make up a large percentage of the market. Needless to say this release is long OVERDUE!!!!!!! Come On!"
1,Where is the entire box set ?,"I'm looking for all the seasons of one of the best series that I've ever seen ! Come on, man ... Where is the entire box set ?"
2,wonder years - not going to happen,I have read that the Wonder Years will never be put on DVD because there is so much music in the series and a company would have to get the rights to every piece of music on the show in order to put it on DVD and that will probably never happen.
4,Mastering the ins and outs of Adobe After effects,"If you read DV magazine Trish Meyer, Chris Meyer are no strangers to you. This book continues the tradition from the exeptional good , in depth and informative tutorials found in that magazine. If you are an After Effects user this books is for you , and will help you master this time line based compositing application."
3,Outdated,The book arrived promptly but sadly to my knowledge the book was originally publish a decade ago. When it comes to computer related topics that is just too outdated to be helpful.
5,Worth every penny. I can't say enough good about this book.,"Do not waste any more time with lame rehashes of the tutorials that ship with AE. Get this book. It takes you from beginner to near expert. It has as little or as much info as you want/can handle.It works way better than the Total AE Tapes, too.... It may be cool to see someone actually do the tutorials with you but it's hard to use a VHS tape as a point of reference (that and the authors of this book actually have egos that they seem to be capable of holding in check, unlike the aforementioned tapes). In short this is a great book for learning and reference.And the CD that it comes with is actually useful! It has what amounts to another entire book, as well as several free (NOT demo) plug ins. Not too shaby.They even address the differences in Mac and PC versions! If only all computer instruction books could be this useful.I'm anxiously awaiting their book on AE 5."
1,Helpppppp!,"I have purchased this book twice, only to have to return it twice because of a defective CD. What is going on? I would love to dig into this book and start learning but either a portion of the software is inoperable (the image browser) on the first one or the entire disk is not being recognized (my second purchase). It was as if the disk never was burned. My Mac asked me if I wanted to format the CD! All I can say is --GET SOME QUALITY CONTROL measures in place. Regards, Jim Sewell"
4,I Get It Now!,"Okay, it took me a full semester in an After Effects only class to be able to open this book and do ANYTHING, but now I appreciate it."
2,Not really my favorite,"I bought this book along with Rod Harlan's Studio Techniques. Both use completely different styles of teaching techniques. The thing I didn't like about this book is that all the actual step-by-step tutorials are on the CD, NOT in the book. Also, I found the book pages way to cluttered. It looks like they threw as much material as they could at every chapter, without clearly showing how it all works together. I like WHITE SPACE! It makes it much easier to follow along."
5,"Great information, ideas and inspiration!","These two have a lot of information for anyone interested extending their knowledge in DV. I've talked with Trish via email, and that lady is great! She has so much to offer and so does Chris. It is sad that the format is 4.1 but you don't learn anything by opening up someone else's work. DV and anything else is learn by doing. After Effects on Windows! The Mac is the only way to go for DV, remember Photoshop and many of the Adobe products were written for Macintosh and then eventually written for Windows. It doesnt cost $30,000 dollars to get a system going. Use this book and the knowledge in it and expand your horizons. A firm 5 stars for this book! Hope they do another book soon!"
4,Not a book for novice!,"If you just start to learn AE, don't ever think to buy this book first, this may an excellent book for some one who already know about AE...So buy this book as a ""improve""."
4,"Big book, little dog","Very oversized hardcover, glossy pictoral covers, 368 pp; boasts over 100 color and b/w photos but looks like more, just about anything you'd want to know about Schnauzers. By the Queen of Judges, Mrs. Nicholas. Over 3 pounds of book, s/b priced to compensate for projected expensive shipping costs. Essential to Schnauzer lovers, including history throughout the world, breeding, genetics, selection, judging and conformation of the Schnauzer, obedience, pedigrees, kennel histories, and much much more."
3,Great Historical Detail BUT....,"It's great if you are looking for historical accuracy, Cooney is a good writer, but for this story, she goes a little overboard in the depressing story-telling style. It starts off Sad and Depressing and only gets worse. It has a somewhat good ending, but leaves alot unsaid, only sums a brief history at the end. I read it in 2 days, but was disapointed at the end. She doesn't give readers a reason for her wanting to either stay or leave. If you like historical accuracy and love bitter endings this story is for you."
3,The ransom of Mercy Carter,"This book is very interesting it follows the life of Mercy , a young girl who lives with her step mom and takes care of her siblings. She lives in a settlement where it is very cold. Her settlement is attacked by Indians who kidnap most of the women and children and then kill almost all the men. The children and women are taken on a trek through the cold winter. Mercy slowly loses her siblings one by one until she is alone and is sent to a Indian camp there she learns of their lifestyle she is taught respect . Mercy finds that she enjoys Indian lifestyle. I like this book even though it is sad at parts. It helps you understand others. I would recommend this book to others because it keeps you wondering if they will ever be ransomed."
3,mixed bag,I thought this book was a mixed bag.It was really sad and there was a lot of killing.I would recommend it to other people but it wasn't my favorite and I wanted the story to end differently.The girl Mercy had to choose whether or not she would accept ransom.Read the book to find out if she does!
5,cookbooks,"This is a great book to have. Recipes seem good.They shipped fast, and product as described."
4,Product Recommended,"I'm a student at a Canadian High School. I really wanted to go to school in the US, so I got this book. I was really going into it not knowing what to expect. This product really helped. I went into the test confident. This is a great product for people not knowing what to expect going into the test.This book talked about how to save time. It also coaches you how to pay attention to detail (A problem I have)ie: Words to watch for in the question. Great book!"
3,"A Somewhat ""Romanticized"" Bach Performance","The first problem I have with this recording is the performer's extremely free additions of ornaments that are not in Bach's scores. While these may be somewhat justifiable as common practice in Baroque period music, they are rather unlikely considering the pedagogical nature of the composer's original intentions for these works. Schiff's use of outright RUBATO in places absolutely kills the forward-moving rhythms that one longs to hear in these pieces. Schiff's fabulous technique is evident in every piece, but his phrasing is almost as though he were playing Brahms, rather than Bach. Purists who are looking for an accurate performance from a historical perspective will NOT enjoy this CD. But again, the pianist's technical prowess is quite praiseworthy, despite the CD's lack of historical style considerations."
2,Schiff falls short this time,"His 2 and 3-part interpretations sound thin and mechanical. I'd caution anyone to buy it, and at least listen to Glenn Gould or Angela Hewitt before. Schiff generally is an excellent Bach:ist, but his inventions and symphonias are not up to the same level as much of his other work. The best recording all categories for these works on piano is Gould's. For Harpsichord, I like Van Asperen a lot."
2,Chromatic fantasy is the biggest disappointment,"I will return to the inventions later. Returning later: the more I listen to it, the more I get disappointed: it lacks emotions. It is my general impression of Schiff's playing Bach - unemotional. I'm done with him and moving on to other interpreters.My biggest disappointment is the way he plays the last piece - Chromatic Fantasy and fugue. The fantasy has an improvisatory character which is missing in his playing completely. All the suspense and half of the pauses are gone, especially bad is the fist half of it. Compare Schiff's interpretation with, e.g., Edwin Fischer. I still yet to find more modern as much satisfying interpretation. Harpsichord version by Landowska is excellentBach: Goldberg Variations; Chromatic Fantasia & Fugue; Italian Concerto."
3,Average,"Writting reviews about lesser talented pianists who are now building their house in the wake of Gould always seems to be the perfect occasion to say astoundingly stupid things about Gould - the wolf hunted down by dogs scarving to turn him into a dog.Schiff, as with other Bach works he recorded up to now (2005), offers an average, good, gentle but non remarquable nor memorable performance here, with dubious legatos, superfluous qualm and unjustified sentimentality.May cause deception and drowsiness."
3,This is NOT drawn by Ai Yazawa!!,"With all due respect to Ai Yazawa (I'm a fan of Paradise Kiss myself), it's disrespectful of the actual author of Princess Ai to give her the credit for this work. According to Tokyopop itself, Ms. Yazawa was employed to do initial character designs only. Please give credit where credit is due: the one who made Princess Ai into what it is is the manga-ka who has her name on the cover: Misaho Kujiradou.As for the manga itself, I found it to be cute and pretty -- a light, enjoyable read, though I think ultimately Yu Watase's work is more rewarding!"
5,A must have CD,"I bought this cd when it first came out when Hot 97 and all the other radio stations where pumping out the Freestyle. THis CD contains all the classic songs with the most noticeble not as common songs such as ""X-Ray Vission""By Tka, Tolga's ""Lovin' Fool"" and MOnet's ""Come On To Me""."
3,Not her best but...,"While Isabel Wolff undoubtedly writes well and I finished this book quickly, I later found myself thinking that the protagonist was not someone I really liked. She was rather whiny(I don't want to say more lest I spoil it) and I just didn't really care about her. I think the fact that all the supporting characters(as I've noticed now in several of her books) are much more likable made me enjoy it. Overall, it's not her best, but it's an easy, entertaining read."
5,This a wonderful collection of stories to listen to.,I too have been searching for this out of print CD. Please reissue the CD. I know a number of people who would be interested in buying them.
4,Great Albums for reflection and entertainment.,"These are great albums. I remember seeing the group perform on a couple of the Smother's Brothers Show when they had thier short-lived comeback. I bought the tapes then, but have misplaced them over time and would like to buy the CDs. I know there are at least two albums. Amazon, please solicite a new print of these wonderful performers."
4,"Pretty good, a little dispersed","The listing didn't seem to quickly show the books inside:* Modern C++ Design, by Andrei Alexandrescu* Accelerated C++, by Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo* Essential C++, by Stan Lippman* Exceptional C++, by Herb Sutter* More Exceptional C++, by Herb SutterMy primary complaint is that two of the books (accelerated and essential c++), are rather beginner-oriented compared to the advanced nature of the rest of the books. The other three were great, but I found little use for accelerated and essential."
4,A Good read for young preteens,"I'm actually 19, and I used to be a big fan of the BSC when I was in my preteen years, and I came across this book the other day and it brought back memories. Stacey goes on vacation with her father and claudia, but they don't know she's really there because her boyfriend is vacationing at the same place. The only thing that wasn't necessary about this book was Mallory and Jessi working at a day camp back in Stoneybrook, that really wasn't interesting to read, pretty stupid actually and totally unrelated to the book. But nevertheless a good read."
4,Stacey's mess,"This book is a really good book but it isn't the best. Stacey's dad tells her to pick a place to go on vacation to. She picks Davis Park because that's where her boyfriend is working at. She brings Claudia along.But then Stacey spends all her time with Robert and Claudia's mad. Then Kristy, Shannon, and Mary Anne arrive for the Fourth of July and Claudia gets them on her side. Now no one's talking to STacey.Can they ever be friends again? Read this book to find out."
1,Unrealistic,"First of all, Stacey never actually lied! She just didn't tell her father that she wanted to go to that particular vacation spot because she wanted to see her boyfriend there. Also, the way that Stacey and her father behaved toward each other when they were angry was very immature (isn't her father a little too old to be not speaking to someone when he's mad at them?)."
2,"Nice watch, poor quality","I love the watch, but the quality is awful. The glass on the face broke after about 3 months of normal use. I didn't smack it on anything, it hasn't fallen off of anything, I'm at a total loss as to how it could have happened. Also, the clasp no longer works. I've owned this watch for less than a year. For the price I would have expected it to hold up quite a bit longer."
1,"Laughable - ""Catholic Lite"" at its worst","Rather than being a critique of the church, this book is a good example of what has gone wrong with women's religious communities in the USA. The author wants to blame the church for the incidents of child abuse, while praising the homosexual clergy who perpetrated 90% of the abuse! (That statistic is a fact - check any major news source.) People like the author are themselves abusing the Church - by using the church as a forum for their own extreme and un-Christian views. Much of the prose in the book shows an irrational rage - often found in abuse victims who themselves go on to abuse others. Overall, an embarrassment to the author and her cause."
4,The Only Religion is the Truth,"At first I thought this book was going to be the ""traditional nun"" book. But instead I found a woman who was willing to look down the barrel of corruption's gun and not give the typical answer of ""I will pray about it."" She actually put prayer to work by confornting the corruption in her church but in addition treading on the thin ice of RC theology. Instead of dogma she sees the face of Christ in those she ministers. To bad there are not more like her.There is only one thing I wish she would have delt with is the corruption in female religious orders where the same games are played by females. This is a hard issue to face and most children and nuns who have been victimized by nuns have taped their mouths silent with humiliation. For starters she should read Ashley Hill's book Habits of Sin and then get her broom out,begin sweeping and write another book."
1,Unbelievable for Sister Jane Kelly,"This is by no means a ""Vision of Hope for the Catholic Church and Society."" This book goes against basic Catholic teachings. Save the money you might spend on Sister Jane Kelly's book for a more worthwhile purpose. ""Taught to Believe the Unbelievable"", is merely an unorthodox interpretation of Catholic belief and teaching. Save your money, and more importantly, your time."
5,Excellent game for kids,"I have not found a better educational game for preschoolers. My oldest loved playing it and solving the puzzles, then going back and watching the story again. His sister also enjoyed the story, though she was to young to play it by herself. The puzzles take quite a bit of thought, but the characters are very encouraging, so he was eventually able to work through them all. Navigation is much easier than similar games I have seen, such asDidi & Ditto: Kindergarten Win/Mac. Also it gives you the sense that you are moving through a virtual world, rather than levels of a game. It ran fine on our ancientApple Power Mac G5 Desktop M9020LL/A (1.60-GHz PowerPC G5, 256 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD-R/CD-RW Drive). Really too bad this is out of print. You can't have my copy."
2,RUST!! After only one year the rust is bad in the bottom.,My husband and I received this as a gift last year (2011). It does a good job of grilling....BUT be prepared for rust. After just one year the bottom is already rusting out. And so-called protective cover that comes with the griller is very cheaply made and shreds in no time. We now use a tarpaulin on it. While we are very grateful for the gift we are very disappointed in the quality.
2,Grill was dirty,"Char-Griller 2222 Pro Deluxe Charcoal Grill & Smokerby ChargrillerThis grill seemed to be used already, or the coating left on it sat for years, perhaps 10+ year. Most of the parts had a sticky, brown film over them, and was on the plastic wrap, sticking to the parts. Especially the fire grate bottom, where the ashes fall. It was disgustingly filthy. I spent a couple hours cleaning the pieces before assembly. Too much trouble to return. Next grill I'll get at store."
4,Great Grill for the Money,"Received the Chargriller Pro Deluxe Charcoal Grill & Smoker yesterday!After opening the box and looking with fear and aw at all the different component's I started to search for the assembly instructions...............none included!After finding a few choice words, I found enough confidence in myself to assemble the Grill with out any instructions and attacked the assembly like a four star general and to my surprise found it to be surprisingly easy!The Chargriller Pro Deluxe Charcoal Grill & Smoker looks like a sturdy and well manufactured Grill and shall be tested on the 4th of July!Except for not having the assembly instructions, I am very pleased with this product!"
4,Assumes *nix?!,"To be honest I have only made it perhaps 1/3 of the way into this book. I found it to be interesting, but what had not been clear or even mentioned in the book description was that the book seems to assume you are running Apache on Linux. For the rest of us, that is a huge bummer. I'm sure I will plow on, but the enthusiasm is somewhat gone, I wish authors or publishers would mention that sort of thing in the writeups."
4,Deeper than you think it is...,"Please read the other reviews for an overview of major plot points. The film follows Julie Hagerty's character thru a series of different mishaps, in all of which she seems to come out of on top. However, as the movie progresses, you begin to see this ditsy ""Type A"" New Yorker show real character and ethical values as she turns down enough money to return to Paris and instead insists that a fruit dealer stop cheating the Kibbutz. In another equally poignant scene she exposes her roommates ""boyfriend.""This is nice little indie comedy - nothing more, nothing less. The good guys and gals come out better off and the not-so-nice ones come up short.It's fun and different."
5,"Goodbye, New York...Hello, great movie!!","Well, to me, ""Goodbye, New York"" is a sweet, romantic comedy that is almost like ""Sleepless in Seattle"", but not quite. ""Goodbye, New York"" has Julie Hagerty's character playing an angry New Yorker who finds out that her husband has been cheating on her with another woman and leaves him. She gets on a plane to Paris, but eventually ends up in Tel Aviv and joins a group in the process. This is one of Julie Hagerty's better films to me, even though she was great in both ""Airplane"" movies and ""What About Bob?"". This is also kind of ironic because Julie is the only major star in the film. But that doesn't matter because this movie has comedy and a little bit of drama. ""Goodbye, New York"" also has a little bit of heart as well. Truly one of the better Julie Hagerty movies."
5,I have just loved this movie since I first saw it!!!,This is a foreign film but it's in English. It was made some in New York but mostly Israel about 26 years ago 2 years after I was born so it's not the best quality but I don't really care about that because it's a sweet story about a woman who has some crazy and funny mishaps and grows some along the way and in the end finds a nice guy. I would definitely recommend this movie!
1,A Total Fraud,"I picked up this dvd at Borders recently thinking, foolishly, that it was an objective examination of biblical tradition. It turns out to be nothing more than a ""creationist"" tract laced with psudo-scientific mumbo jumnbo. Borders should be ashamed to carry a title like this without a stern advisory - ""WARNING - this video contains material that thinking people may find higly objectionable""."
3,"Just OK, not that much fun","This toy is well made. But it isn't very fun. I bought for my 2.5 year old. She would play with it for 5 minutes, play with the puzzle pieces and then move on. It just wasn't all that exciting. I had high hopes based on all the great reviews. The toy just doesn't have much too it to capture attention for long stints."
1,CHOKING HAZARD DO NOT BUY!,"This toy includes 7 pieces that do NOT meet the recommended guidelines for toys made for under 3 years of age.The 7 tall stacker pegs are only 1 inch in diameter at the widest part. The size does not meet the Consumer Products Safety Commission's Small Parts Regulation that requires all toys made for children under 3 years be at least 1.75 inches in diameter.The toy also does not meet the CPSC labeling regulation that requires a toy of this size to state on the package ""not recommended for children under three ... contains small parts""."
4,4 years of play and still going strong,"This is one toy that both of my daughters have enjoyed. I just cleaned out all my closets, and this is one toy that definately did not go in the donation box! It was packaged differently when I received it as a gift 4 years ago, but I simple put it in another sturdy container to keep all the pieces together. Very easy to clean up because you don't have to work the little puzzles to put it away."
3,"Looks OK, but ""tote"" is a little disappointing","I purchased this as a gift so it hasn't been played with yet. Hopefully it will get the approval of our toddlers (Grandchildren), but the tote is cardboard and arrived slighty torn at the top edges where it opens. I can see it deteriorating quickly. I wish the description had noted the tote is cardboard as I truly thought it looked plastic in the photos, which would hold up better."
4,Excellent for travel!,"We bought this for an airplane ride with our 18 month old and even now at 2 1/2 we take it with us. It works to entertain him for a chunk of time. He particularly likes the little stacking things. The tote it comes in isn't that great but we didn't care because we repacked everything into his own little backpack (along with books, stickers, crayons, coloring pad, etc.)."
4,Great for waiting in the doctor's office....,This toy is a must have for the doctor's office. It is perfect for the long wait as it keeps my 2 1/2 year old busy. He adores the pegs and is able to do the puzzles without much help. We don't play with it everyday but is perfect to take places on an as need basis. My only regret is that I did not have it with my older two kids.
3,Not good 'plane toy for 15-month kid,"Nice idea...just to say that for a kid of 15 months or so it simply means that all these little pieces get thrown all over the plane and other passengers...now I'm preparing for another flight a few months later, I'm doing my best to find toys that are magnetic etc and can't be showered everywhere like confetti..."
4,A great take along toy,I bought this specifically for air travel and was pleased. My 34 month old enjoyed each part and I like that everything can be kept together and put back in the tote.
4,"Great ""busy bag"" package","The Toddler Tote is a fantastic self-contained package of activities to keep on the shelf and pull down every once in a while as a ""new"" toy. At 2, my son is still more interested in making the pieces dance and naming what the shapes are than putting the pegs together or putting the foam pieces in. The pegs stack onto each other as well as peg into two of the foam shapes. The individual puzzles are nice and sturdy.My only dislike about the toys is that the larger shapes puzzle is very thin and flimsy, which makes picking it up intact to put back away a pain, as the pieces barely stay in. All in all a great toy, though!"
5,GREAT travel toy!,Our 22 month old grandson played with this in the car on a long drive. He loves it. It's also great for a restaurat toy as it is easily cleaned and makes no noise. I like that the manufacturer offers replacement pieces at a resonable price.
4,good product for on the go,"grandson really likes playing with these, they are colorful and keep his attention . he enjoys them and i like that they teach him hand eye coordination, and dexterity"
5,One of the best Rap Albums ever!,Biggy makes you want to get up and do some thuggin'! It's a sad situation to have him taken from us so young in life.
4,Great cd from one of the greatest rappers,"This is one of the best double cds I've ever heard period!!!! Biggie speaks some truth on songs like ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" and ""Ten Crack Commandments."" All true rap heads should go get this one. RIP Biggie!!!"
4,One for the ages,"I'll always love Big Poppa. One of the greatest MC's of all time laced the first disk. The second was ok, but needed a little more. Big represented all that was good and bad in Hip-Hop. His flow was one of the nicest. May he RIP wherever he is. He had a variety of beats and used a lot of different producers like Primo and RZA. It's too bad we will never get to here another BIG album."
2,It could have been better,"Biggie did improve himself on this album lyircly. But I still would not put him in the same ranks as Nas, Prodigy of Mobb Deep or the late great Tupac. One thing that's missing on this double cd is Biggie's rawness. He doesn't hit you with that stuff like he did with his previous songs (""who Shot Ya?"" ""Dreams of #$%*ing an R&B B*tch,"" or ""The What"". Biggie was obviously all about the flossing and glossing on this album which really upset me. Some of the songs I felt that were too sweet for my taste were ""Miss U"" and ""Sky's the Limit"" I also was not feeling B.I.G on ""Nasty Boy"" I mean picture B.I.G as a Nasty Boy...ugggghhh. But Hey did album is not a total loss. The first disc is really hot and you will enjoy it. So you will not be too disappointed."
4,This is a Perfect CD - It is Everything in one,This is a great piece of work. Some good party music - some good hard-hitting lyrics and a nice slow jam to close off. Excellent!
2,Lame.,"While the first album was raw and bursting with energy, this album is totally flat. Had Biggie lived, he would have gone the way of Jay-Z (release one classic album, and follow it up with a bunch of trendy, Top-40 ready crap). Biggie's ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" was a huge smash, and it eventually clued a slew of no-name morons in on how to make a successful rap album, which spawned the mainstream hip-hop slump the world has been experiencing for nearly a decade. A shame. I often wonder how this sophomore album would have sounded had he NOT been on Puffy's label.The same thing happened to Tupac, who had a great run of early albums, then became a boring, predictable ""thug"" when he signed to Death Row.When a music lover has to seek out the underground stuff because a particular genre has gone completely sour in the mainstream, that means the genre is dead. Hip-hop is dead.Buy the debut and forget the rest."
2,This album is easily overrated,"Biggie is not the best rapper. We all no Tupac is and that's probably why Biggie never tried to battle rap with Tupac because he would get ate up. For a double disc there was only a few stand out songs. For some reason I can't listen to the whole thing because I get bored listening to it so easily. If you want a good double disk album get Tupacs All Eyez On Me, or Tru's Tru To Da Game."
3,Way too commercial...,"Good songs, but the album is way to commercial. The only one who makes money of it is Fluff Daddy...There's also many songs that could've been skipped. But gems like the fantastic ""Sky's the Limit"" makes you ignore the passable cuts like ""Mo Money Mo Problems"". I just can't stand Puffy and Mase on the last-mentioned song.Three stars then. A decent double-album that went way too commercial. Still, I recommend B.I.G-fans to check it out."
2,Not near Ready to Die,This album was nothing near his first. The Puff Daddy influence killed this album. Life After Death sampled too many catch songs and stole too much lyrics to become a classic.
3,"Good, but not better than Ready To Die.","There just was not any memerable songs like Juicy and Big Pappa. Biggie is one of the best rappers, but his producers are weak (Puffy)."
1,the name fits the game,"Biggie Smalls, A (very) BIG man with a (very) SMALL amount of talent. nuff said"
1,studio gangster at best... stick with Akon or Lil wayne,"Im a big hip hop fan, my favorites being Drake, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, Limp Bizkit, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer... but lately ive noticed alot of folks seem to dislike good musicz. Back in the 90s MC Hammer and Vanilla ice created Hip Hop & Rap. things were great before fakes started taking over the scene! Studio gangsters like NWA, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Ice Cube, 2Pac, and Notorious BIG became famous and everyone forgot about good music like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.Anywho..this Notorious BIG guy faked his death to make more money! I mean comon, its sooooooo obvious hes not dead. If he were dead than why would his album still be for sale? Not to mention he cant rap and his beats suck!! Stupid songs like ""Notorious Thugs"" and ""hypnotize"" have STUDIO GANGSTER written all over them!For good hip hop stick with Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Akon, and Lil Drake."
1,Rap is fine as long as it's talking about something intelligent,"I bought this because it was on sale and is extremely popular. After a few hours of listening to it I deleted it from my computer.There's too much death in this music, all it talks about is death, dying and shooting in gory detail. Things like girls getting mutilated by gunshots and brains being sprayed all over the sidewalk.If people like listening to stuff like that then you'll love this album. As for me, I don't see why anyone would. Rap is great when its clever and talking about something important. I wouldn't waste your money on this and instead use it for something that has a little thought put into it like Immortal Technique or Talib Kweli."
1,The most overrated Rapper ever,"All y'all thinking Big is the greatest rapper ever -Reality check: Tupac is the greatest rapper of all time. This album sucks, the beats are tedious, the lyrics are brained and Biggie's monotous style sucks. He was jealous of Pac,Tupac was real, this clown was a commericialized puppet who never grew up in the struggle that he talked about, i'm sorry to tell you Big fans this but he went to a friggin private school! nuff said."
1,Utter Crap,"Fooled you with the title and rating, did'nt I? This is one of the best albums in hip-hop,and definetly one of my favorite albums in general. Cop this (meaning GET it) along with:Project: Funk Da World, Craig MackCoral Fang, DistillersIllmatic, NasAll Eyez On Me, 2PacMaster of Puppets, Metallicaand to conclude this, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' 50 Cent"
1,ONLY SOLD BECAUSE OF CONTROVERSY.,"This album is way too overrated by all the controversy surrounding it.The fact is that this album really sucks and is a poor excuse to make money by poop diddy.There are only 5 good songs out of 26 total songs on the album.All the rest are only filler material.This rapper died because the rap world is full of criminals,materialism,greed and jealousy.This guy is no angel himself because he used to sell crack for his own materialistic ends and never really helped his own community when he could have.DO NOT BUY THIS SUCKY CD!!!"
5,Greatest CD I Have!!!,"Greatest CD I Have!!! If you like him this is the best cd he has out. I would like to say yo to Cornered01,KatFude,Short360,PoofPoofff, and anyone i missed. God luvs all!!! Can i have a Amen.""Amen"" thanks all."
5,Great Double Disc - Best results,"I was amazed when I purchased this CD. It had the commercial and underground balance that I didn't espect which is very impressive. The album is very dark and very lyrical. the mast at work, Notorious B.I.G. did it B.I.G. Style and he gave his listeners what they wanted, the truth."
4,CLASSIC BAD BOY RECORD !,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST OF IT'S TIME.WHEN THIS ALBUM CAME OUT BAD BOY WAS DOING GOOD FOR THEMSELVES.BIGGIE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MEMORY.
5,Thank You Biggie,"This is one of if not the best rap cd i've ever heard. I'm not one of the people to just jump on the Biggie bandwagon when he died or Pac, this album along with Pac's ""All Eyez On Me"" is ALWAYS in my cd player there's not one bad song on this in my opinion and as far as who was better Big or Pac there's really no war at all between them and really neither one is better than the other. Big and Pac 4Life"
1,worst ever,"I bought this for a gift for a relative, and it was horrible. They liked it alright, but it just gave me a headache."
