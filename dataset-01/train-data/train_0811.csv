5,classic,"My five year old daughter discovered the Peanuts this past Christmas and has been asking for more ever since. This video is a classic and really holds her interest. She literally laughs out loud at parts. I have to admit that I really enjoy it too, and it brings back very fond memories of watching these programs when I was a child."
5,youngatheart,"I saw this as a child but I had not seen it in years.My sister was telling me that she had purchased this for her daughters so while I was talkng to her long distance, I just simply ordered it from Amazon. The movie was totally ENJOYABLE! the charaters were rich & the story was excellent. These days this movie about Charlie Brown would be considered different because he would be told to have low self-esteem. Not really. He is a person like you and me that haschallenges. The part I like was any scene with Snoopy. He was the BOMB! I also like the bit with Schroder on the piano. Someday soon my next movie will be SNOOPY COME HOME! Again, enjoy!!!!"
1,This WAS a widescreen film,Once again a studio/dvd marketing company has cheated fans out of their money. FALSE letterboxing of full frame copies that have ALREADY been truncated should and needs to be considered a crime! Some time ago there was a class action lawsuit against MGM for bilking customers in this fashion. I hope I see when this one comes up.
2,Have your kids watch someone get verbally abused through half the movie,"This is a wonderful movie - with much more artistic content than the earlier shorter Christmas story video. It is great except that for half the movie people are calling Charlie Brown names. Blockhead, worthless, etc etc. We had to stop the movie while our four year old was half through. I should have prescreened it.I don't trust peanuts videos now - for my impressionable four year old. Maybe when she is older...(P.S. - read the thoughtful comments to my review. I guess the problem is not necessarily with the movie but with my daughter's age)"
5,Peanuts - A Boy Named Charlie Brown,I grew up with Charlie Brown. As a child I couldn't wait to wtch it on TV or get the comic books. Everyone who grew up with Charlie Brown and felt for him each time something wrong will enjoy this DVD and so will your kids.
3,"Good Grief, A Spelling Bee!","This is some good movie, but there's a sad ending. But I highly recommend it!"
1,not a soccer ball.....it is a basketball,"My son chose this ""soccer"" ball because he liked how it looked. We received this ball in the mail only to notice that it was really a basketball and not a soccer ball like the title shows."
1,Definitely worth a miss,"I have never seen such a beautiful amalgamation of half-baked jingoistic ideas. A badly written novel, that should have been cut down to half its current size, merely suggests that Mr.Clancy should consider early retirement if he can not work hard on his storytelling."
1,"Good book, lousy publisher","This is a review of the Kindle edition only, not the novel itself.I am a fan of Clancy's Jack Ryan books. However, the Kindle editions of his books that I've read so far - Executive Orders, Clear & Present Danger, and Hunt for Red October are all lousy.The publisher obviously did not make ANY effort to proof-read the Kindle edition before release. There are many hundreds of typos in each book - missingspacesbetweenwords, ex tra spac es inse rted into words, swapping ""e"", ""c"" and ""o"", etc. It looks like the books were scanned and converted by an automated process and OCR software, but no human ever looked at them, and they didn't even run a spell-checker on them.Absolutely no professionalism in this publisher. Clancy should take his books to a better publisher."
5,A definite must for all Tom Clancy fans!,"I never could believe that anybody would out do Tom Clancy but neither could I have expected him to out do himself. That is exactly what he's done in 'Executive Orders'. The book starts off from where 'Debt of Honour' left off. Jack Ryan, now the President of the United States has to deal with more threats than any President in history. From danger to his own life and that of his family's to widespread danger aimed at the whole nation. All this and more brings 'Executive Orders' to a thrilling climax, worthy only of Tom Clancy."
2,Clancy's worst effort,"It's surprising that other reviews have mentioned his misogynist attitudes and not his Islamaphobic themes as well. I suppose that most Americans agree with his views on Islam and Muslims but it remains that this book is downright hateful. Even without his overplayed biases, the book is much too long, plodding, and even boring in many parts. What happened to this once-fine author?"
2,ZZZ!,"Ryan didn't enjoy being president but felt it was his duty. Well I know how he felt, I felt I had to read the one Clancy novel I hadn't gotten around to but I didn't enjoy it much. Ye Gods! It was as if Ryan was REALLY the president and we had to read every newspaper story of every crisis or roadblock thrown in his way. It isn't going to happen because of all the $$ Clancy makes for his publisher but it would be nice if someone told him he needs an editor with a very big axe. No wonder he's been linked with Stephen King in some articles lately, neither one has an editor who can say ""No"". I'll still read his next one though; duty calls."
2,Clancy's political agenda shines through,"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's writing. I loved all of his book from Red Storm Rising to Sum of All Fears. Unfortunately in this book Tom uses the device of Jack Ryan becomming president to spew his own conservative agenda for 1300 pages. Jack becomes president without all the corrupting campaigning, fund raising and promises most pols have to make and this would probably be a better way to get a president but, Tom's simplistic solutions to all the problems America faces in the 90's is just too pat.The Ebola main plot was compelling and drove me through the dozens of often meaningless subplots to find out how it all turned out. But in three weeks of slogging I was still a hundred pages from the climax and I had to return the book to the library. I was actually relieved that I wouldn't have to read any more.Tom should stick to the techno-thriller formula he's great at and leave the lecturing to political writers."
4,A great addition to the Clancy techno-thriller collection!,"Classic Clancy! Continuing the Clancy tradition of intenational intrigue, Clancy puts Jack Ryan in the world's most powerful, yet vulnerable position. Tom Clancy is a master of knitting together international politics, military insight, technological savvy, and thrilling spy drama. Before reading this novel, I would recommend reading all the other ""Jack Ryan"" novels from Clancy. ""Executive Orders"" draws from these other works frequently and the reader won't want to miss any of the exciting elements that are alluded to here.Bring on some more, Tom!"
4,"Long book, but a good one at that.","Executive Orders is 1,358 pages long. Not a book for the easily distracted. It took over a month and a half to read.President Jack Ryan is a wonderful character, and in spite that I disagree with the character's political views, I can't help but wish that we had a real Jack Ryan in the White House. The other characters such as Cathy Ryan (the first lady), Andrea Price, John Clark and Ding Chavez are great characters also. It confronts a lot of issues, such as chemical warfare, the media, and political intergity. The plot is outlandish enough to be interesting, but down to earth enough to be believable.I found the war scenes near the end of the book to be boring and too complicated. They don't help the plot one bit. This is the only weakness the book has, and otherwise, it is a great read."
4,Wanted a Presidential Novel and I got one!,"This was the first novel I read in my recent novel readings. I was a little unsure because of the size of the book (over 1,000 pages) and I haven't cared for the Tom Clancy movies. This book had great depth and knowledge of the Secret Service and Military Hardware. The politics in this novel were great from Ed Kealty to Tom Donner. I enjoyed Arnie Van Dam, John Clark and Ding Chavez. I also like Agent Andrea Price and plot with Aref Raman was great. The reason this book gets a four instead of a five is because of the one hundred or so pages of blow by blow military jaron that I just did not care for or was not interested in paying attention. The end came to a nice conclusion and kept my attention. My next conquest is the Bear and the Dragon and I hope I like it."
3,Good but too much,As Clancy goes this was OK. I actually really enjoyed the first 1000 pages but found the in depth battle scenes a little like watching paint dry. The whole mountain men thing was a total waste of time and I'd agree with most reviewers in the point of view that Tom needs a new editor. On a positive I think that I am one of the few who liked Ryan as president and want another insallment.
2,the effort & time needed to finish the book is not worth it.,"This is the first Clancy novel I have read and I was quite disappointed by this novel. The lack of an editor clearly shows in this 1300 page door-stopper in which T.C. flows from one subplot to another in a matter of a few lines. This makes it too hard to follow the different storylines and this back and forth style does nothing to impart suspense or inttrigue (maybe so if it were a T.V. show or movie). Several subplots prvoved to be anticlimactic or irrelevant to the major plotline. Mix in ALOT of T.C.'s endless ranting about the needs of today's government, and you have a recipe for overrated and bloated political fiction. I think Clancy is too big-headed for his own good and needs to take a long break and read books outside of his genre for refreshment ( I recommend A Game Of Thrones by George R.R. Martin)."
2,Much too long,The usual Techno-thriller that Clancy is so good at writing becomes lost in this overdrawn highly conservative book. Much of the story line was hackneyed and has been previously overdone. I found myself merely wishing for the pages to end so that I could find something more worthwile of reading.
3,just too long,killing the president along with rest of the government was rather interesting. but i have to say that clancy dragged the plot a little too much.also portraying the beliefs of a madman (especially a fictitious one ) as those of a religion ( in this case Islam ) is just not on.
2,Long Winded,"Having read all the reviews, I must admit that I am going to be a bit of a heretic here. Well, here goes - I disliked this book. I found it long winded. At times, it felt like I was reading Tom Clancy's political beliefs as opposed to a work of fiction. I didn't think that it was at all suspenseful - he moved away from the plot line for such long periods of time, that it completely broke the feeling of suspense. I actually found it predictable in parts. I felt that the TV interviews of Jack Ryan served no purpose in the story other than to take up a few more pages. I genuinely believe that if it had been half the size, and just concentrated on events directly related to the story, it would have been an excellent read.Sorry"
4,Jack Ryan,I have read several Tom Clancy books and just love the way he writes and has obviously researched to a great extent.
2,Mixed Bag,"The story is great, but there is a problem with formatting that made reading the book on my kindle difficult to understand."
5,Excellent-One of Clancy's Best,"Jack Ryan becomes President of the United States in this Clancy novel, and must face the daunting tasks of restoring the nation's government, managing a health crisis, and win a war. I thought this book was excellent, even on a level with The Cardinal of the Kremlin. Although long, this book has many very interesting stories that all come together for a very nice ending. Worth reading if you are a fan of Clancy, or if you are not, read it anyway."
1,Thank you Tom for giving me so much free time,"This book was so bad that I will no longer feel obliged to continue reading the Jack Ryan series. The book was poorly edited, with plot lines that never came to completion. I still could have enjoyed the book however, if Clancy had not chosen to turn it into a forum to spue his political ideologies. Jack Ryan has become a superhero of mythic preportions, that does nothing but spout conservative retoric."
2,The Jack Ryan series is going downhill fast,"Clancy's best work seems to be behind him. This book is nowhere near in the same league as _Red Storm Rising_ or _Clear and Present Danger_. I stopped reading about halfway through and then skimmed through the rest a couple months later. The plot was decent enough, but the excessive technical details and Clancy's endless preaching of his political views ruin it. This book would have been much better if cut down to just over half its size. Maybe two stars seems unfair but that's all this book deserves compared to earlier work. Let's hope that the next book, about a Sino-Russian conflict, will give us back the Clancy of the '80s."
5,Culmination,"This novel is the culmination of the Jack Ryan saga. Gripping, intense and thoroughly believable. Jack Ryan has been one of my favorite characters since his debut. Every new saga was eagerly anticipated. This final novel is the perfect ending to the years of pleasure. It picks up where the previous novel left off with Jack Ryan being sworn in as President. As usual he capably handles adversity while maintaining his humanity. This is Tom Clancy's best work ever! This series is one you can enjoy many times. It's worth re-reading the entire set more than once. I have."
4,Another page turner...,"It usually takes me about the first 180 pages of a Clancy novel to really get into it. After that I have trouble putting it down until the last page is turned. This one was no exception. Clancy has the connections to provide chillingly accurate detail about world politics and political intrigue that undoubtedly has leapt right up from the Joint Chiefs of Staff's book of possible terrorist scenarios. But Clancy is also able to provide a little bit of human, even in his most detestable characters. I still have trouble keeping track of the sheer number of characters Clancy introduces (I'm always paging back to see who someone is or where they came in), and I still think Red Storm Rising is the infinitely BEST Clancy novel ever, but this was a good read. Can't wait to jump into Rainbow Six..."
5,An explosive book from the master,"Tom Clancy delivers a massive read that in it's own right is worth every page used. Jack Ryan, sworn into the Vice Presidency only seconds before now finds himself, his family, and his security detail the only survivors of an elaborate plot to kill the President, Congress, the Juctices of the Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs, and the Cabnit during a joint session of Congress. Suddenly plunged into the most stressful job in the world he must find those responsible, moniter an assasination in the Persian Gulf, and respond to the most horrible of crimes, a biological attack on the U.S.! This thriller belongs in evey good literature collection and is a must have for all Clancy fans."
5,Inevitable!,"Through a twist of events, Jack Ryan is thrust into the presidency. Not at all sure he wants this tremendous responsibility, or the politics that goes with it, he doesn't even get the luxury of a ""honeymoon period"" before he must face a horrible breakout of Ebola. As always, life is one catastrophe after another, and Jack performs admirably. This is a great book, rivaling his earlier Red Storm Rising for excitement. Of course it screams for a sequel, which has been a l-o-n-g time coming. The Bear and the Dragon will be released in August 2000...I've already pre-ordered it!"
2,"The book's size is eclipsed only by the ego of its author,","who continues to believe that thickness equates with quality and that his text is unworthy of an editor's pen. Obviously written with movie rights in mind, this $28 doorstop takes its readers through the usual twists, turns and returns, stopping briefly to introduce characters of every conceivable stereotype, all the while creating a story line just barely within the realm of believability, even for Clancy. Pedestrian dialogue (unless there are acronyms in the sentence) and a weak ending make this one of his more disappointing works. Moreso than with his others, however, you can literally skip entire pages and not miss a beat"
2,Pretty tedious.,"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy, but I think that his last few books aren't nearly as good as his first few. Not much happens, it takes hundreds of pages to get into the book. Sound's like it's time to retire Jack Ryan and start with some fresh plots. Forget the terrorist stuff and get back to nation vs nation"
2,Can't wait for the movie.,"It's not surprising that the Clancy tomes have worked bestas movies. With the possible exception of ""Hunt for RedOctober,"" the movies have all managed to extract thefacinating premises and thrown away most of the lectures inhistory, political economy, geopolitics, military tactics,military technology and religion that Clancy insists onincluding in his tomes. This novel is not the exception.Clancy is at his personal best when he focuses on thepremise, as he did in ""Hunt for Red October."" But, inthis latest novel, Clancy once again decides to includeall his background research instead of doing the novelist'sjob of transforming the research into textures and moodsthat convey authenticity in more subtle and less numbingways.Wait for the movie, or buy the audio book."
1,Too long and too political.,"Not only did it take forever to read, but it wasn't worth it. Tom Clancy's plots are generally good for fiction, and the movies made from them are excellent, but this one really was not worth the time it took to read. Jack Ryan became a reflection of the political beliefs of Tom Clancy -- and too much space was wasted on Clancy's (hidden through Ryan) views on abortion, gun control, etc. His dream idea of the perfect, responsible government was ever-to-obvious. And his attempts at showing off military and medical terminology, acronyms, etc. just got old after a while. Re-read one of his older books instead."
4,An excellent juant while driving,"While having to drive about an hour a day for work, I decided to give Clancy a try to help pass the time (NPR can only do so much after about a month <30 hrs of radio time>). The audio CD was wonderful and really helped pass the time. The story is interesting - lots of twists, turns, Clancy techno-battles, and interesting characters - without the volume issue that makes the reader decide what sections to skim.As well, I really enjoyed the reader for the book (even though I panned Mr. Hermann in 'A Beautiful Mind', he did a wonderful job here). He paced the desert war, the gun battles, and the moments of intrigue (the lead-in and standoff with the rogue secret service agent comes to mind) well, keeping interest and at times causing me to sit in the car for an extra 5-10 mins waiting for a scene to play out. All in all, a solid 4 stars."
1,un buen libro para atajar una puerta,"este libro es excelente para atajar una puerta o para hacer ejercisios, junto con otros libros malos para levantamiento de pesas. la trama parece la de una pelicula de esas que se ven para esperar que a uno le de sueno. un presidente que tiene que tomar el mando despues de que el gobernante actual es asesinado con todo y gabinete, una trama de unos arabes, es aburridisimo y mas porque el autor se lo toma todo tan en serio y termina creyendose su historia. ademas el libro es excesivamente largo, no lo termine, con cada pagina me iba a burriendo mas y finalmente despues de usarlo como banquito, termine regalandoselo a una profesora amiga que es fanatica de tom clancy, asi que creo que lo deje en buenas manos.LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
2,Executive Problem,"I despise Tom Clancy on principal. I can't stand his politics or the way he tries to push them on readers of his books. With that said, for some reason I can't stop reading his books. However, it's really time to get rid of this 'Jack Ryan' fellow. I mean, come on. It was bad enough when Tom Clancy made the guy National Security Advisor, but becomming President by a bizzare twist of fate such as the ridiculous one which takes place between this book's predecessor, Debt of Honor, and Executive Decision is practically laughable. I got addicted to Tom Clancy books because of their realistic portrayal of how the government operates and military operations; somehow, after The Sum of All Fears, this gets twisted into Science Fiction."
1,This Book is Not English it is American,"A horrible book. Firstly too long. Readers will forget the plot by the time they reach the last chapter.Although this is a great plot in my opinion There are also many grammatical mistakes so horrid I dare not utter them here. Clancy attempts to go Pro America but ends up telling us that the world is equal to hell...that we all should die. Mr Sabir Aah says ""I dont dare touch that book. I hate clancy"" If you are a bold reader then you may try this book. For most readers however, I would warn you...By the Way if someone with lots of time, power, ink and/or money could turn this book into a 500 p. one it would be worth 1.01 stars."
1,Executive Orders,"This is one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels. However, I am going to return these cassette tapes because the 4th and last tape broke. I will ask for a replacement though and not a refund."
1,I Hope you know:,This book really sucked! Really Sucked. I only got through the first 200 pages and had to put it down for extreme boredom. Sure it was good in the beggining with the plane crash but then you just have crap from there on! It very much sucked it sucked very badly! Gotta go I have to burn my HardCover edition of Executive OrdersTommy boy remeber to right a good one next time ok?
1,Ths book would be useful as a doorstopper instead.,This is my first and last time readin' his book. The pace is soooooooo slow and long-winded that I fell asleep while trying to read it .This is worse than James Joyce's Ulysses .
4,Very good,"I loved ""Executive Orders"". I'd been meaning to read it for well over a year now and finally got around to ordering it from amazon, along with that new WWII novel everyone is talking about, ""The Triumph and the Glory."" President Jack Ryan is masterful in ""Executive Orders"" I felt like standing up and cheering him every other page because he was doing exactly what should be done in real life and too often isn't. A GREAT adventure, buy yourself a copy and enjoy it. I did."
4,a good but long book,"Executive orders is not the best tom clancy novel but is a very good one. Its 1300+ pages set up a good ending but it takes a long time to get to it. If you can't stomach a long read i don't reccomend this book, however, if you are looking for a book to get really caught up in this is your book. Overall i thought it was a good book."
5,This book is awesome,"I hear many people who don't like this book say it's too long, or too confusing, or it didn't hold my attention. The only thing I can say to this is ""Get a freakin' brain!!"" You'll need one if you ever want to read something by a great author like Tom Clancy. This is one of the best stories I have ever read. If you love to read great books with great stories, READ THIS BOOK!"
3,Overkill,"This is a great book and definitely an overkill. Probably the first Clancy's book that sometimes becomes really boring - the suspense is here but you get tired being ""suspended"". It's also too sugary: patriotic, naive, too much bier und pretzel."
5,Not bad at all - read it in four days,"The tank battle at the end dragged on and on, the mountain men bit was a little dissapointing - but I've read all the insults directed at this book and I disagree.. In my view this has got to be one of the best books I've read... I would certainly reccomend it to a Clancy reader."
4,"OK, but a little overdone.","I have read most of Clancy's works and have found this to be quite enjoyable, if a little overdone. Ryan is larger than life and has become almost invicible. However, the story moves and entertains as a good ""light read"" should."
3,An above-average (not great) story needing lots of editing,"I remain a Clancy fan...although it is getting harder to make that claim. EO should have been edited down by a third, with some story lines eliminated. Clancy's growing need to inject his political leanings into his writing is distracting...even when you agree with him."
2,Jack against abortion ?,"The follow-up to well-written ""Debt of Honor"" was a bit of a disappointment. I regret to admit that its the first Clancy novel which is boring, too long and sometimes irritating. Here follows some of my points. (1) Jacks conservative blabblings. Why does Clancy turn him into a hard core Republican? (2) The ""mountain men"" side story feels somewhat fabricated and the way it ends is anticlimactic, does Clancy believe that a link to the Oklahoma city bombing will make his story more realistic? (3) The ""sleeper agent"" story is very illogical, why do the Iranians not kill the President at their first chance?. Beside from these flaws I guess this book is a must for any Clancy fan including the few of us in Denmark."
2,A major disappointment for this Clancy fan.,"I very much looked forward to to the exciting possibilities after Clancy's last book left Washington in flames and the federal governmetn crippled. I was extremely disappointed. This book is in dire need of severe editing. The story could have been told in half the space, certainly in less than the obscene 1300+ pages that it rambles on. I've read all of Clancy's books but I doubt that I will read another unless his publisher gets him back on track."
2,Read this one last!,"Clancy's books usually read fast. This one doesn't really pick up until right at the end. Normally, I overlook his bland use of language because the plot and subplots are so rich. No such luck. Maybe this isn't really a 2 star book. But, if you want to read Clancy, look to his books. If you liked all those, punish yourself with this one."
2,Clancy has gone commercial.,"Well, at least it makes a good boat anchor. Clancy has obvously gone off the deep end with his effort to ""make money"" by commercializing his book. Give us a break: He throws in the kitchen sink trying to cover every possible plot for a story. We have the Oklahoma City Bombing, so he includes the Mountain Men. We have ebola popularity, so he tries to capitalize on it. . . etc. etc. etc. I assume that his next book with include a trip to mars for Jack who is offered command while he single handedly stops Pakistan and China from blowing each other up with their newly tested nukes while China launches its new hi-tech missiles at the U.S. only to see them destroyed by the new beam particle laser that is mounted on Ryan's mars shuttle. Maybe someday, Clancy will leave a few popular plots out of his book so that another writer will have something current to write about. I think he has turned into the Wal-Mart of novels. So sad, for such a talented author."
3,"Good, but not nearly his best","I read Dept Of Honor and loved it. I couldn't wait for the emanate sequal. I was a little disappointed, though I was probably looking for too much. Plus, some of the conserative views in the book bothered me. Still, if you usually like Clancy and liked ""Honor"" it's worth reading."
2,Much too long,"I bought this book for the summer holidays, but soon found more interesting lecture and never finished ""Ex. O."" The book is really confusing. It would have been better if it had had a third of its size. Some authors just dont mind what they're putting over the readers."
1,Kindle Version of Penguin Books is Horrible!,"I love this series, but the Kindle version is so fraught with typos that it is somewhat painful to read. They need to do a better print to digital conversion and then proofread it! You should be ashamed to make libraries and the public purchase these at a premium."
3,"Basically well written, but Clancy's politics get in the way","Clancy is a very good writer, but this isn't one of his best. I found myself skipping a lot of his opinions that pushed his personal political beliefs. Trying to make the disgraced form Democratic VP an inept pansy, for example. I think we've only had one VP like that, Dan Quayle. There were way too many subplots as other readers have commented on. As for Iran easily taking over Iraq, well I think that was too hard to believe. Mainly Iran is Persian and they speak Farsi, while Iraq is Arab and they speak Arabic. I don't think you would be able to merge their armies at all. Currently the main religion of the two countries is binding them together, but only time will tell if they become good buddies.The book is worth reading, but I'm glad I got it used."
3,May be original at the beginning,But the end is totally immature writing. It's like me making sense of battlefield news. Not Clancy's best. Just meh.
3,Tom Clancy Book,"Although I'm a fan of the Jack Ryan series, Executive Orders plods along too much. However, you need to read this book so you can follow Jack Ryans life."
3,Greatest Book Bargin of the Century (on a per month basis),"I paid about $25 for Executive Orders and finished it in only 5 months! What a deal! Five full months of Jack Ryan angst for only $5.00 per month! Oh yes, I also got up close and personal with Ebola, a badly executed kidnapping, a cement truck full of fertilizer and diesel fuel, a confused Secret Service agent, a very bad dictator, and a replay of the Gulf War (Readers Digest version).What I wanted (and still hope for) is a novel of the quality and intensity of Red Storm Rising. I've read all of Clancy's novels waiting for this. One hint for Mr. Clancy; guess who wasn't in that one?"
4,Clancy Thrills Again,"Tom Clancy continues the saga of Jack Ryan's accidental climb through the US Government. A bit wordy and too many subplots, Executive Orders will still keep those familiar with Clancy's series up past midnight. White hats, black hats, spies, and jingoism: it sells! Why mess with success?! (A word of caution: Clancy spoke at my alma mater and is an incredibly egotistical ass. So in the interst of your own well being, keep your contact with Mr. Clancy limited to his books only."
4,Jack Ryan (Clancy's alterego) is in his toughest role yet.,Ever wonder what the daily life ofPresident Bill Clinton might be like? Or Hilary's? Or Chelsea's? How about the real-life difficulties of the Secret Service? Mr. Clancy explores these matters in his latest book with the thoroughness which like his earlier novels prompted a comment from a member of the former Soviet Goverenment as to (it's) accuracy.
5,This is the next blockbuster movie from a Tom Clancy book!,"As usual Mr. Clancy begins with a rather simple premise and explodes it into intrigue and espionage on a grand scale. Take an ""obliterated"" Congress and Senate, a President left to 'pick up the pieces' and start over, and throw in the possibility that not all of our ""allies"" are not as friendly as they used to be and you have the makings for one of the best books and potential movies of the year. I read the book in one sitting, as I could not put it down. When the video comes out it definitely goes into my collection"
3,"Exciting ending, but way too long","The book had some exciting parts, but it was way too long and had too many boring political ramblings. Clancy could have easily trimmed one-third of its length. He could have left out the Mountain Men entirely.Clancy does much better writing about the military than he does about politics. The whole thing with Kealty did not make sense. And I sure got tired of Ryan's/Clancy's conservative agenda.As always when the battles start, Clancy's superb storytelling finally comes through."
2,Big Book - Good Pillow,"This novel reached a point when it seemed to embody Tom Clancy's vision for how a government should be organised in a perfect world, he just had to find a way of wiping out the existing government to do it! It's still an entertaining story, but I think I laughed more than the author was intending. Although I loved Clancy's earlier books, he's pushing the boundaries of credibility, and in this genre they tend to stretch pretty far anyway. On the plus side, I did discover that this book made a surprisingly comfortable pillow when reading on the beach. One for the big Clancy fans only I think."
3,Good but not great...,"I have been a long time fan of Tom Clancy but this book seems to fall short of his best work. While the usual technical jargin which kept me, an avid armchair military enthusiast, interested, this book was not up to the usual Clancy standard. The subplot involving the Moutainmen got me very interested at first and their treasones activities made me want to know what their final plan was, but the way in which they were caught made the entire subplot pointless and useless. As well, in the epiloge, Pat O'Day and Agent Price are to be married? Where was that EVER forshadowed in the book? If they were to be married, then at least there should have been some pretense. As i have just finished Executive Order, i will now begin to read The Bear and the Dragon, i only hope that this book will be better."
2,Long Winded,"I have read all Tom Clancy's books with the exception of his ops book. It took me four years to find the energy to finish reading this book that had a rather convoluted plot at the outset. In uncharacteristic style, this book seemed to ramble and peter out in spots. The battle rhetoric was over the top and unnecessarily long winded. I only finished it in order to read the newest Jack Ryan epic, The Bear and The Dragon, because regardless of the rambling, I still really like Ryan, Clark and Chavez."
5,Probably Clancy's Best,"'Executive Orders' makes a strong case for being Clancy's greatest novel. Dealing with the beginnning of Jack Ryan's Presidency, 'Orders' has Ryan coming to grips with his new situation as chief executive while battling foreign and domestic enemies who seek to undermine the USA. One of the greatest aspects of Clancy's novels is the optimism in America that they inspire. 'Orders' in no exception. Thrilling in it's action, daring in it's philosiphy, and just a lot of fun, this is truly a great modern American novel. No-it's not high art, but it is what it is- A wonderful novel by Tom Clancy."
1,TC needs an editor.,"There's no reason this book needs to be this long. Tom Clancy needs an editor with a STRONG hand. Too much extraneous and repetitive detail. Plus, where's NATO? The USA would get no help from friends? Give me a break. Oh, and we have made strides against at least one virus: Polio. Vaccine and everything. Besides the editor, add the fact checker."
5,Jack Ryan - Executive Orders,Tom Clancy at his best. Tom takes the suspense and intrigue one step further and you can almost hear the suspense music as you read this novel taking Jack Ryan to the highest office in the land and the problems associated with that position. A true thriller.
5,A wonderful mix of politics and action - a real page-turner.,"Executive Orders is a terrific mix of politics and antipolitics. Jack Ryan is at his best as president! This book is my personal favorite out of the Jack Ryan series. Jack is the perfect president - non-political. Clancy has written a real winner! The action does not stop in this book, it is one thing right after another. Executive Orders ist he one book out of this series that Clancy shows his true talent for writing a perfectly nonpolitical book. This book is not only excitng, but it sheds light on things like what being the president is really like. I liked this particular book also because it was the first one that I felt I really got to know Cathy in, too. Ten thumbs up!"
5,100% Excellent!,Executive Orders is a masterwork. This is the epitome of the Jack Ryan series. There is only one problem. Who are Kealty's cronies and who are just jerks.
2,"Walter Mitty, Soldier of Fortune (with H. Ross Perot)","In the face of stiff competition from Pixar and Nintendo, escapist fiction must paint itself in ever-gaudier colors and offer all manner of perverse pleasures to attract the reality-impaired. Thus we have Executive Orders, which thrusts YOU (vicariously) into the role of Jack Ryan, intelligence operative and all-around great guy, selflessly shouldering his (unsought!) responsibilities as leader of the Free World"
2,"Go back writing like 'Red October',put Jack back in the CIA","These last two books have left me wanting the old Jack Ryan, Mr. Clark and the rest of troops. If I want to be told how this counrty should be run I'll watch sunday moring talk shows"
5,Tremendous Book!,I have read all of Tom Clancy's novels and I think that this is his best by far. From the first page till the last page he has you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next to Jack Ryan and his family. I really had problems putting this book down and am really looking forward to his next book
5,Tom Clancy has woven yet another fine work of fiction,Tom Clancy has done a marvellous job of interconnecting various action scenarios and pulsing each one of them at the right times to keep the reader informed and at times suspended to keep guessing what the next move from the other side will be.His research of defense information and tactics are definitely award worthy. In particular I was amazed at how precise he was in saying that the Bob Hope class vessels built at Avondale were diesel powered. This was great because the ships hadn't been delivered at the time the book was written. Not only that but also the fact that the Bob Hope(s) built at Avondale are diesel powered and those built at the other shipyard are gas turbine powered.Bravo Tom Clancy!
5,Clancy finally kicks some butt,The one thing that Clancy is good at is telling one major story while intertwining alot of little ones. Jack Ryan finally gets to show the world what he is made of. Being a former soldier I am always intrigued with how he gets right at the heart and soul of American military men and women. His story of bio-war '97 was also well researched. Since I work in the biotech industry I was also enthralled that he chose a topic that I am familiar with. Keep 'em coming Mr. Clancy!
3,LONG AS HELL! BORING! WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MR TOM?,"I've always bought the hardback cover of Mr. Clancy's books. I don't know why I chose to buy the paperback this time but I'm glad I did. Not only would I have wasted my time thinking it would get better but I would have been out the extra money. Whew! In view of recent events ie..Anthrax/biological warfare and previous world happenings, he's usually not far off the money. Only for that reason did I rate this book a ""5"". Otherwise, would probably have gone a ""2"". This book was surely much too long, conclusions that came from who knows where and too much to do 'bout nothin'."
3,Did not really get any thing done.,"Un like all of Tom Clancy's other novels, Executive Order did not really accomplish any of the tasks it need to do at the start of the book (such as rebuild the government, figure out what China was up to ...)Unlike all Tom Clancy's other works, The book starts out extreamly slowly, with nothing really happning in the first half. The second half finally has some action with the Ebola attack and other things, they soon boil over. The story had a lot of pontential, but I think that the book's execution was flawed."
3,"End is great, the rest is MUCH too long and slow","I've read every Clancy book, and this one was disappointing. The end - last couple hundred pages - were up to his usual, but the first several hundred pages were incredibly slow and drawn out. The whole book would have been MUCH better if it were about 400 pages long."
5,Comments,"I had always been a Tom Clancy fan, ""Executive Orders"" is one of the best Works I had read. The seceranio pointed out by Clancy was very realistic during the time of print. Jack Ryan as the President of The United States made me feel that there would not be any future releases of Ryan as the main character."
3,Way Too Long,"After reading the shocking conclusion of Debt Of Honor, I couldn't wait to pick up this book and read it, but I was somewhat dissapointed with the outcome. The problem with this novel is, well, some of the stories don't really go anywhere. Take The Mountain Men for example, I din't see why they had to be in this novel, Tom Clancy just started to write it, then all of the sudden, he was writing like he thought 'Oh yeah, The Mountain Men. Almost forgot about them'. And I didn't really like the ending to this book either, it was like he was running behind scedule, so he tide-up everything in the last 2 chapters.Other than that, I think that this was a good novel worthy of 3*'s/5*'s. Though not the greatest Tom Clancy novel, and one that definatley won't be a 'classic' like The Hunt For Red October, Debt Of Honor or Patriot Games, it's still pretty good."
3,Irritating and poorly if at all edited!,"Bang! Missed me this time Mr Clancy. I found this book to be in dire need of an unafraid and uncompromising editor. I guess no one was ready to take on the job and risk the wrath of the famous money spinning author.I don't like the way we are subjected to continuing politically correct references to a persons sex or color. Seems to me that mentioning a ""Black"" General is about as rascist as coming straight out and saying ""Look at us, how liberal and color blind we are for having blacks in our army."" Why mention it at all. Anybody watching TV news can see all kinds of different PEOPLE doing all kinds of different jobs without regard to sex or color.I can't get away from the impression that this book was put together from a jumble of ideas and facts from research people who then called in the author to put it together. Lots of ideas and lots of research and not well connected. Mountain Men?"
5,I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end.,One of Tom Clancy's best. It has some remarkable paralells to events taking place today.
5,More and more...,"By the end of ""debt of honor"", I was really amazed by the incredible ascension of Jack Ryan. He was becoming POTUS. Then I asked myself what he would become at the end of the following book. Fortunately he is just POTUS for another time. Will Clancy have enough ideas to interest readers now that Ryan can't go higher ?? I hope so 'cos I really enjoy his books. Thanks a lot Mr Clancy"
4,Wow.,"I think that this is seriously one of the best books that I've ever read. The scary part is that this book starts with a plane crashing into the Capitol building, and I began to read this book on Monday, September 10th, the day before the planes crashed into the WTC and the Pentagon. That was truly bizarre. I think this book is a good read, although it did make me kind of scared to wake up in the morning, hoping that the book was not coming true."
2,A good reason why Clancy has stopped writing.,"This is Clancy's first bona fide sequel, taking up exactly where Debt of Honor left off. As such, it's a little less egregious that he insists on using all the same old characters for every minor role. The battle scenes are still excellent, and his descriptions of hopelessly complex technical stuff, including the Ebola virus in this one, are his strong points. He again displays a total ignorance of espionage and how it works (with the CIA having exactly two field officers who do literally everything), and he relies on incredible coincidences for his sleuths to crack the mystery. As a conservative, I always love how he paints the liberals as limp-wristed, inept, corrupt swine, although he kind of goes over the top in this story. We can only hope that we have seen the last of Jack Ryan now, although at least Clancy didn't have have him slinging lead this time."
2,"Too long, tedious and boring!","I am a Clancy Fan from the start. have read all of his books, have his computer game etc. I got bogged down on page 308 of 875 and never went back. A good editor could have knocked off 200+ pages easily. It did not have the snap of ""Sum of All Fears"" or his first two novels. Instead it had way too many subplots, a fairly ( for Clancy, boring main plot, and too much stuffing in between. If you doubt me, read one of his first two novels, and then big up this behemoth and see if you can finish it! If you have not read his non-fiction books on ""Submarine"", ""Marine"" , ""Armored Cav"", and the non-fiction account of Desert Storm, and you are a military junkie, don't miss them! The best book of all is ""The Tom Clancy Companion"", trust me..."
2,The Flaw,"First Clancy I read was Cadinal of Kremlin and enjoyed it. So, I make a mad rush to the store to buy this utterly flawed yarn.The main plotters in Tom's hostile world, China, Iran and India, happened to conspire ""together"" against US. Yeah, China and India on a same bunk bed!!! Tommy, if you're gonna mix facts and fiction, atleast get your facts right."
3,Question???,"Based on what Tom Clancy said on page 1162, ""Named for Admiral Isaac Kidd, who had died aboard USS Arizona on the morning of December 7, 1941, she was a member of the 'dead-admiral class' of four missile destroyers originally built for the Iranian navy under the Shah, forced on a reluctant President Carter, and then perversely all named for admirals who'd died in losing battles,"" What does the Iranian Navy stuff mean here? Why does Clancy mentioned President Carter? And on page 1170, there's a line saying ""The group commander is Greg Kemper. I don't know him, but his rep's pretty good. CinCLant likes him. He's asking for a ROE change."" What's ""ROE?"" I'd be very appreciated if anyone could tell me."
3,Tom Clancy is getting carried away,"I did like this bok, and found the story to be well paced and exciting (if not a little over praising of the majical U.S. military and private businessmen). The connection with past novels such as The Hunt For Red October and Cardinal of the Kremlin was very ineresting and signaled the point in the book where things started to get really interesting. Unfortunately, by the time I got there (roughly the half way point) I had read the equivelant of two NORMAL books.Executive Orders is 1358 pages long! Sure my favorite Clancy, Red Storm Rising, is over 700 pages long - which is still twice the normal book length- but once you break the 1000 mark, you know you need some SERIOUS editing. Much of this book is pointless filler that adds little or nothing to the story. Exec could easily be cut down by at least a fourth, if not half!Tom, if you're out there, you do write well, but just don't write so much!"
3,Overly long but enjoyable.,"Executive Orders was overly long but somewhat enjoyable in the end. I don't know if Clancy thinks he's being paid by the word or what, but this book was incredibly long and full of ""filler"" material. 200-300 pages could have been cut out of the 800+ (hardcover edition) and this would have been one of his better books. But, as it stands, the exciting ending is marred by the heavy midsection. If you have time, pick this one up, but otherwise, try out his older books where Clancy was at his best."
1,Dull. Insulting. Bad.,"Tom Clancy was once my favorite author. ""Executive Orders"" pretty much confirms that I've out-grown his work. Clancy's skills have been in decline since 1989's ""Clear and Present Danger"". ""Executive Orders"" sums up many of the things that are wrong with his writing- the endlessly long plots, the technical-laden language, clunkey dialouge. Clancy's heros are dull- one-dimensional over-achievers who seem like xeroxes of one another. Clancy's villians are worse- charactures, one-dimensional bad guys. It is as if Clancy is so afraid of the reader thinking for him or herself he finds it necessary to stack the deck. Clancy's political sentiments are expressed with the subtlety of a jack-hammer. Those not sharing Clancy's right-of-center mindset will find their beliefs and their intelligence insulted time and again.Stay Away. Stay far away from this one."
3,"Too long, too many characters, too many unresolved plot li","I've purchased and read all of Tom Clancy's books in hardback. But the end has come. I can't bear the thought of reading about how Jack Ryan runs for President and succeeds in changing our political system in the process. This book would have been interesting if cut in half. It was a summary of every book the author has already written, and if I hadn't read all his books, I wouldn't have a clue who he was talking about most of the time. It was like reviewing for a test on Tom Clancy books. Diane Diekma"
5,Un-relentless Storyline,"I loved this book! Clancy is like a juggler of words. He started out with one story in the begining of the book and ended up with ten or so. Towards the end of the book the mini-stories are resolved and effect the remaining stories.My favorite parts were the ones that included Clark and Chavez and their clandestine operations. Clancy must have put a James Bond edge on these characters because they preform with utter grace.I agree with many other readers that criticized ""Desert Storm II"", The plot in that mini-story didn't pick up until too late in the book to end it with the eloquence that he ended the other mini-stories.I was very impressed with the speeches POTUS made, they conveyed more power than any president has conveyed in a long time. But Ryan realisticlyshot him self in the foot several times before hisspeeches meant much of anything.I was suprised how Ryan put the Ayatollah in a Candid-Camera situation towards the end."
2,"Save your money, and save a tree (or three)","Tom Clancy has done the undoable in this book. He has created a novelization of the GOP platform! The first, oh, 500 pages are virtually unreadable, what with the ping-pong plotting, lack of pacing, etc. Clancy has stopped trying to entertain his readers and just bashes them over the head with his hard-right, jingoistic fantasies. Fortunately, he's not hitting them with his book--that would be assault with a deadly (but dull) weapon"
2,How about some proofreading?,"Good novel, but extremely poorly published......at least in the Kindle edition. The text appears to have been optically scanned.....as ""1"" (numeral one) is extremely often used in place of ""I"" (capital i). Spelling errors of the same character name appear often. Didn't anyone proofread this thing???"
5,His Best Yet!,"""Executive Orders"" was easily the best book Tom Clancy has ever written. I feel sad after reading some of these reviews, becasue many of them ask about the point of some of the sub-plots.Examples""What was the point of the Mountain Men""The point was to get across that people disliked Jack Ryan in the Oval Office, just like Ed Kealty and the SS guy plots.""Why do the UIR-ains want to provoke a country with nukes that can destroy their country""The point of this is to show how much some Arab's hate America (which Tom Clancy clearly explained in the book), and to bring all the subplots together for the Second Persian Gulf War, which was the best scene in the book by the way.I hope Tom Clancy's new book is as good as this one."
3,Good story; Kindle edition is FULL of typos.,"I enjoyed the story (although it's one of the last good ones that Clancy wrote, in my personal opinion), but the Kindle edition is rife with typos. They make for very jarring reading, unless you read at the pace of an ELDERLY turtle. Amazon really should demand better. So I say no to the electronic version.That said, I still strongly suggest getting a hard copy and reading it ""the old-fashioned way"" because this really IS an excellent novel. I first read it several years prior to 9/11, and when I heard what had happened on that day, this book was absolutely the first (coherent) thought that came to mind amid the anger and horror of the moment. It's a LONG book - effectively a contuation of ""Debt of Honor"" from the first words of the book - but it's well worth your time to read.So - thumbs down for the Kindle version, but thumbs UP for the novel - and the novel is ultimately what matters."
2,A bit long; not as good as Debt of Honor,"I loved Debt of Honor and wanted to read this as it was the sequel. Too bad. It never lived up to Debt of Honor. I tried 3-4 times (over about 2 years) to get past the first 100 pages, which were painfully slow. I kept reading mostly based on the good Amazon reviews. The book ultimately picked up the pace and became more interesting, but it was just too predictable and lacked much novelty. At times it was dreadful slow and detailed. Overall, I can think of numerous other books that are far better than this one."
2,Not a Fan,"For a book this lengthy the character development was weak. Instead of developing the characters the author chose to fill white space with a tax policy proposal. Most people read novels as an alternative to reading about issues like tax policy. Additionally, what was up with the domestic terrorists? Their plot fizzled out as an afterthought. The whole domestic terrorist aspect should have been stripped from the book by the editor along with the uninteresting tax proposal content."
2,Entertaining author who empowers his characters with his wishes vice reality,"Tom Clancy is a great author, I will not take that away from the man. From his first story to his masterpiece Without Remorse, he is without a doubt a phenomenal entertainer. His current novels stemming from Debt of Honor, yet exclusively within this tale, his viewpoints are too prevalent within the tale to truly appreciate. This would not be so bad, except for his characters internal soliloquy which are completely out of touch with cultural personalities (ie: when the Saudi prince ""wishes"" his country were more like America... not so much). If he were to stay away from detailing his perifial characters whimsical thoughts, the novels would be shorter and that much better. I feel he is trying to put too much of his perfect world into the books which ultimately take away from the great entertainment he provides."
5,Read it Now,"I read this book when it came out and it is everything you expect from Clancy, a very well thought out story line with lots of details, great character development, rich in sub plots and story. Ok, he is increasingly leaning to the right of Rush Limbaugh, but that is kind of the charm. Well, now comes the new global reality we have with the 9/11 attacks and wow, this book almost reads as a historical fiction book. Ok, it still needs a little bit of faith on the readers part, but look at what is in the book, a presidential sex scandal, A passenger plane used as a weapon, biological terrorist attacks, and a President with a CIA background (ok wrong Bush but close). All Clancy fans have either read this book or will regardless of the reviews here. For those of you that have not read one of his I think given the times we are in this is a great start and will open you up to a catalogue of great fiction by Mr Clancy, his non-fiction is even not bad."
2,Executive Orders too fragmented,"I've been a long time fan of Tom Clancy although Executive Orders was one of the first Clancy books that I've read recently. I was disappointed with this book partially due to its overall length. It seemed that the first 500 pages could easily have been dropped. I literally skimmed 100-150 pages just to get through it. I didn't feel that I was developing a relationship with any character in the book. Sure, President Jack Ryan was the main guy, but he was still way too distant to really feel that you cared that much for him. Only in the last 200 pages did the pace and action pick-up. Save your time for something else."
3,solid where Clancy sticks to what he knows,"Monster of a book. Solid where Clancy sticks to what he does best (writing about espionage, warfare, foreign affairs, and so forth), but weak and tedious when Clancy tries to bring in his politics (over a full page devoted to a ""flat income tax"" doesn't advance the story at all, for example). Weaker than his other books (the next book, Rainbow Six, is much better)."
5,Worth the time it takes to read,"Tom Clancy shows how the United States political system should be run! This book shows what could happen if politicians weren't scared about their careers and actually tried to accomplish something. Though long, it develops a very good plot, and i think this book is one of Tom Clancy's best. The ending is spectacular, or at least i think so. As usual Tom Clancy produced a great page turner and an overall great book."
3,"I love Clancy, but....","I love Clancy's writings, he is probably my all time favorite author. I had many people tell me this was his best book yet, but I disagree. To sum it up I think the master tried to do a few too many things with this one. The Jack Ryan of Patriot games seems to have been taken over by some kind of alien. He used to be a mix of classy Annapolis, cagey spook, and take no garbage daredevil. In Exec. Orders he seemed a little too much like a high school drop out who thinks he knows everything -- out of his element and deceived. The presidency would surely change a man and I think Clancy did a good job showing the stress of that position. But it felt like some fundamental elements of Jack's personality had changed. Not just covered up by presidential stress, but gone. If you're a Clancy fan you won't be miserable reading it. If you don't like him to begin with, stay away from this one."
4,"A great book, similar to Outbreak","This book, plainly evident, was inspired by the movie Outbreak starring Dustin Hoffman. It is the sequal to Debt of Honor, and in light of recent events, is spooky. It parallels our current Anthrax crisis, but in this book it is the Ebola virus, following a terrorist attack in which a plane crashes into the White House. This book was hard to put down at times. I would definately recommend this one."
5,Executive Orders-the book with the plot,"This is my second favorite book. First is Rainbow Six. If you like a great plot, read this book. The plot is so deep. The only thing about this book that I didn't like that much is the detail. It was still a GREAT book. I encourage you to read it, even though it might take you a while."
2,Stop preaching!!!!,Why do good B authors feel that they can preach as soon as they have a few best sellers? A good thriller ruined by Clancy's political preaching. What are lectures on the capital gains tax and abortion doing in a thriller? I skipped large sections.
1,The book is awful,"This review will be as short as the book was long. It stinks. The premise is stupid, the dialogue wooden. This man needs an editor. It is hard to believe that the book was accepted for publicatio"
5,One of Clancy's best yet.,"As a Clancy fan from before the movies, I was very excited when I saw he had a new book out. I couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed.Tom Clancy has a way of pulling his readers in and making it impossible to set his books down. Granted it was 875 pages, but it was well worth the wait. Clancy can create a situation and hook his readers like no one else I know.The premise of the book is ingenious. With the Soviet Union no longer in existence, and Russia not a serious threat, writers like Clancy need to look elsewhere for the bad guy. He's found it here.All in all, well worth the $20 and 2 weeks it took to read the book."
2,"Take-Out Orders, Not Too Executive","Best described, reading this book gave me the same feeling I get when I stand in line at the check-out at Taco Bell. ""A long wait for the action (food) and then when I get it, it doesn't satisfy or fill me up"
2,800 + pages of boredom...yaaaaaaaaawwwwn,"Skip the first 600 pages because nothing actaully happens until the last 200..the first 600 are wordy,boring ,and heavy on mminor details. Is Clancy taking writing lessons from Stephen King or what? The story could have made a good 300-500 page novel"
4,Interesting concept but Clancy needs a good editor.,"_Executive Orders_ is really part two of _Debt Of Honor_.If you liked the last two Ryan books you will probably likethis one too._Executive Orders_ continues Clancy's speculation on thenature of future war, set in an America facing internalcrises the likes of which it has never seen before.The plot is a good one but the book should be atleast 300 pages shorter. It would be about that muchshorter if Clancy didn't feel the need to stop andexplain everything. It isn't any worse than itsimmediate predecessors in that respect, but the writingstill gets in the way of the story."
1,"What Next? Jack Ryan, Chief Justice","Please. I have read most of Clancy's books and enjoyed them. This one, however, was worse than any biological assault an evil nation could think of. I really wanted to give it no stars, but alas I can not. Clancy's political views and somewhat poor understanding of public administration aside, the plot was absurd, dull, and predictable. And the shallow, trite dialog leaves me at a loss for words!"
2,Get to the point!,I agree with reviewer Zzzz. This book is a mass of twisted stories that seem totally unnecessary.
5,a really great book. MUST READ!,"you know i address dis to everyone who knew the the character - JOHN PATRICK RYAN - I've read the book of Mr. Clancy since CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER and it's so believable. Dis one is so great.Mr. Clancy really put the reader on excitement. Since i read EXECUTIVE ORDER just dis last few days even on the first page of the book you will find the excitement since JPR took the position as president of USA though Ryan didn't really much like the responsibility as president of a powerful nation. So to the fanatic reader of TOM CLANCY's novels, don't mis dis one.IT MUST BE READ."
3,Just above average,"This compact disc is pretty narly 4 the true spiderbait fan. It's their original,techno punk style that made them famous. the killed it by making a comeback with a song written by Ram Jam back in the late eighties. Bring back the good stuff!!!"
2,Bad porn instructional video,"I love John 5. This video is very poor. I think musicians need to understand that not all people who are fans are MALE. I don't want to watch naked girls while I am trying to learn guitar. Very weak video and barely any training on the guitar, more like a bad porno movie."
3,Not bad for the price.,"The watch has great looks, but accuracy is not what you can expect from this one. You have to adjust the time on a daily basis. It look gigantic and feels like you have something really heavy on your wrist. The quality is another issue. You will get what you pay for. Don't expect more."
2,Perigaum Limited Edition World Timer P0501STS,"Perigaum Limited Edition World Timer P0501STSShipping from JS Jewelers was faster than advised.The Quality of the watch: You get what you pay for. This is not a $750 watch.The bracelet looks like cheap plastic.Perigaum is not a German watch maker, it's build somewhere in the world, but the user manual is printed in Germany.Don't expect too much from the S-2280 automatic movement. You have to readjust the time each day by a minute; even if you wear the watches day and night like me.If you looking for a good working automatic watch, you probably have spent a little bit more money."
3,Defective handle,"First time used in water, rubber material covering the handle came un-glued and material peeled back. Had to buy waterproof glue and re-glue the material."
4,Interesting & Concise,"I'm not a scholar on this subject, but I enjoyed this book. There are no bombshell revelations here, at least to the layman. However, it is an insightful account of the atmosphere in which the German statesmen and diplomats worked. It shows how the information flow was controlled by various people, in order to safegaurd their careers and lives. In turn, this information control affected decision-making at the highest levels. This book is also well-organized and concise, making it very easy to read."
2,Not a historical research,"This book is written by a publicist, not a historian. Thus it is biased, muffled and childish work. Not for a serius researcher."
4,great tool,planning a trip and had more time than money. found this cheaper than any travel guide at most book stores nd it provides an excellent guide to more than just Boston! Looking forward to a well planned and organized vacation in New England next month
4,Typical guide book,This is your typical guide book for the tourist. It is done quite well and is much better than AAA's guide book which always seems to point out the worst restaurants.
1,Missing Northeastern Connecticut?! Who knows what else they are missing!,"Taking my book back today, I had thought that they were supposed to have the best information and detail. They didn't even include the Northeastern part of Connecticut. How is that detailed? I had bought this to get more information on New England and am only semi-familiar with the state. I have however been to the Northeastern part of Connecticut and it is beautiful and has alot to offer. Farming, apple orchards, antiques, lovely town fairs and history. If they are missing this who knows what else they didn't include..."
4,Good overall,"We bought the Mobile book, the ""Everything"" book and this book. Of the three, this had the most detailed information. The maps are not great but the rest of the book makes up for that. The regional grouping was a great help."
2,A limited tour of New England,"I bought this book based on some favorable reviews. Several of the other prominent guides for this area got rather bad reviews. I was very disappointed to find that this book is very limited or specialized in some areas and lacking in others. (I live in NW CT and know the NE states fairly well.) We are planning a trip to Mass,.orth shore, not an area I know well. This book was very lacking in info about accommodations and restaurants in the entire area. It is useless for our trip. But if I wanted to go to Nantucket, and area with which I have some knowledge, it tells me about lots of expensive restaurants. I can't believe how little it tells me about New Haven, and Hartford might almost not exist. What were the weriters and publishers thinking? I am thinking I should return the book to Amazon.New Englander"
3,a lack of connecticut,I was disappointed that there wasn't much said for Connecticut in this book and almost half of the book was on MA. There are other states in New England other than MA!!
1,Do not buy Kindle version,"I have bought other Frommers guides that I downloaded onto my I-pad. However, this one has an inexcusable flaw: There is no table of contents. That is ridiculous. In addition to not knowing what exactly is in the book unless you go page by page, you cannot quicly consult something you read previously ( essential in a guide book) unless you jot down the location page on a separate piece of paper. It is astounding that Frommers allowed the book to be released in this fashion and that no one at Amazon pointed out this blunder. All I know is that I will never buy a Kindle product from this publisher again."
5,Genius Invention,"I have used the same Python gravel vacuum system for over 10 years. In the summer I run the hose out the window & connect it to my garden hose which has higher water pressure than the kitchen tap. It cleans and drains a 65 gal tank in just a few minutes. In the winter, using the kitchen tap it takes a little longer, but still works great. Using the kitchen tap has the additional advantage of allowing you to use the hot water to get the temperature close to perfect as opposed to using straight cold water and either risk shocking the fish or waiting hours and hours for the tank heater to bring the water temp up.I wish I'd invented it!"
2,Cheap plastic junk,"I loved the idea behind the python, and set it up easily enough. I think its a total rip off to charge $50 for a piece of plastic tubing with some plastic attached to it.The hose adapter that attaches to the faucet broke so easily when i screwed it in. It takes ALOT of water pressure to make this work correctly. The replacement piece of plastic cost me $10 bucks more than the already rip off Python. Good concept but made of cheap stuff, get a metal/iron one or make your own!!"
4,Better Than I Thought,Pretty decent card game. Unique game-play. Good artwork. Not too long or short to complete.Would recommend.
3,Power button issue,"All in all, this is a good product. My one complaint is that the ""connection"" behind the power button quit working after about 8 months. It will not stay on, even when power button is pushed in. You actually have to sit and HOLD the button pushed in for the unit to get power. We have had to rig it with a piece of wood pushing up against the power button held in place with duct tape and then wrapped tightly with a velcro strap in order to get it to stay connected. Even then, it cuts out and the velcro has to be tightened. I am currently looking for a modem/router combo that has a more traditional power switch as opposed to the crappy ""push in"" button."
4,Works for me,"I bought this wrench as a luxury for a single purpose--regular tightening and loosening of a tow hitch bolt for a bike rack attachement in an awkward location. Works well for that. Not sure how it would hold up in ""everyday use"" since the one I have really isn't stressed very often."
3,Baltimore Foot In Mouth,"I gave this 3 stars as a somewhat disjointed work. The remark from Baltimore Cool:anyone giving this less then 4 stars doesn't know jazz or cannot appreciate jazz is bull. I play jazz piano and have listened to and loved jazz for 30 years. I love everything from Armstrong and Jelly Roll through Miles, Oscar, Evans, Coltrane and on and on. This album went in to many different directions at once for me, not bad, not great. Sorry."
3,Disjointed,"The beginning of this album knocked me out. I thought, wow, here's a new Herbie Hancock Album that is really going to be fun to listen to, great tunes, great jazz piano, great rhythm section. I was impressed with Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder does a great St Louis Blues. By then however, I was beginning to wonder what this album was all about. Then things seemed to really slow down and the mood changed again. The high Soprano in the Prelude in C# minor had me running to turn down the volume and I was asleep by the end of Embraceable You. I would have either done more straight ahead jazz, or more with the vocalists or stuck to the classical but all three at once did not hold up for me."
5,A Masterpiece,One more time Herbie gives us the opportunity to listen to one of his numerous and fascinating musical experiments.Lush is not enough to express the beauty of it all. Outstanding artists joined this project with their immense talent and simplicity. No room for vanity but for real music. We could write an entire book about these unique recordings.Impressively fullfilling.Thank you Mr. Hancock!
2,Selective,"Like so many audio CDs being produced these days, there is a lot of ""lesser music"" tossed in with the ""better music"". On this disc, I junked about 8 out of 14 tracks. However the tracks that I added to my library are superb."
2,so/so,the though of stevie&herbie sounded great never mind the other great talents featured on this disc.but i wasn't feeling it.the pacing was off for me.so i'll just stick to headhunters&thrust.or better yet the stuff herbie did with art blakely&early miles davis.
1,Not much better than chewing aluminum foil,"I can't believe what damage can be done to great compositions. What a bore. George would be weeping at this assault on both his music and his performance. If you are thinking of purchasing this disk, consider burning your money instead. It will be more satisfying."
3,A Bold Three Stars,"Being as how I have not yet heard this album, I can neither give it a good nor a bad rating.Therefore...Three Stars."
3,Herbie and Wayne can still burn!,I bought the record just because of Cottontail. Would Herbie and Wayne PLEASE make a full CD just like that?
2,Waste of time and great talent.,"Another concept album that should have been left as the concept. Joni kills it, Terry Lynn Carrington and Wayne sound great, but I left wondering what all the fuss was about. As an album, it felt disjunct and thrown together. Miles put it best: ""Somebody should take a sign and picket the record company."""
1,IT LEAKED!!!,"My Stainless steel Watts hose was supposed to prevent water damage, but within a few months my Watts hose started putting out a fine mist during the fill cycle. It went into the drywall and soaked into the subfloor, causing over $6000 worth of damage. The Watts insurance adjuster concurred that it certainly looked like the hose caused the damage, but then he took the hose for ""an independent evaluation"". Turned out Watts evaluated its own hose and proclaimed ""No manufacturing defect"". They refused to return the hose, so I had no proof. I WILL NEVER BUY ANY WATTS PRODUCT."
3,"Ditto -- it's not a ""2-pack""","It's only a 2-pack if you consider it has ""2"" ends. I don't know why the mislabel. Fortunately, Amazon will take care of the return."
3,HDTV works with UHF stations...,"I this the antenna is great, but it only receives UHF stations. The problem is, FOX is my area is on VHF even though they are UHF on Analog TV.Check antennaweb.org to see if there are any VHF stations in your area before you get this antenna!"
2,Good looking antenna but it sucks!!!,I bought this antenna hoping that it could work in New York Citybut it doesn't. The receptiopn is very poor similar to an indoor antenna that I have. So there is not point having something in your roof if it doesn't work. It's a great looking antenna that sucks. Besides it doesn't have a post or coaxial cable so if you decide to buy it make sure you that you have the post and the cable.
1,bag of rags,more like a bag of 2inch by 6 inch pieces of t shirt scrap. better off to go buy a 5 pack of fruit of the loom shirts at walmart.
5,A great read,"We Should Never Meet is one of the best short story collections that I've read in years. The stories, each with a unique perspective, are woven together by a powerful common thread of history. I was both entertained by Aimee Phan's beautiful writing and educated by her meticulous research."
5,A great trail guide to the BSF NRRA,"This is an excellent, well-written trail guide. It's organized so that you can choose from among hikes of different lengths and difficulty levels (""options"") from each trail head listed. It took me a little while to get used to this approach, but I found it very effective at helping me determine the best route to take depending on the length and type of hike I want. Waypoints and landmarks are usually described very clearly and the historical and geological tidbits thrown in to the trail descriptions are interesting, as well, giving your hike even more context. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Good book.,"Good book, very informative. Lots of stuff about BSF. Very informative with lots of extras for the serious hiker down to the not so serious."
1,looks are deceiving,"well, when i recieved this mi was inpressed, fit well looked good BUT its under a month old andf its ripping...wow VERY dissapointed in comes in different designs DO NOT BUY..."
4,"GOOD, BUT","Having bought TONE FOR MY SINS first, I bought this after falling in love with TONE. This is good and shows the immense progress that FREEMAN has made. This was released roughly 10 years before TONE and it shows. If FREEMAN follows his pattern, his next release is due approx. 2005. If it progresses as far from TONE as TONE did from BLUES CRUISE, than it might well be the best ever BLUES / ROCK / FUSION CD released. It you're after a cool driving CD, than this will do the job. It is not a patch on TONE FOR MY SINS, but a pleasure none the less."
4,This is what storytelling photography is about!,"Robert Doisneau is one of my favorite storytelling black and white photographers. He wanders around Paris snapping shots of everyday people doing everyday things and his attempts to capture humanity and eternity in one photo are amazing. Before this book, I didn't know his writing could capture humanity as well as his camera!"
5,Amazing photos!,Robert Doisneau is and will be one of my favorite storytelling black and white photographers. His photos always seem to evoke feelings and emotions that are hard to do from a two dimensional static image but it does. His attempts at capturing the human spirit and humanity itself through his camera lens is remarkable and this book has an excellent collection in itself. What most people don't know is that he can write as well as he takes photographs.
1,Dead Lamps after 6 months,"I like the overall design of these desk lamps and I bought two of them for my office last year.Both lamps quit working about 6 months into duty. Thought it was just the bulbs having burnt out, so I replaced both bulbs with Ottlight replacements (at over $10 each). Turned out the ballast/electronics is not user serviceable. So I now have two paperweights. Very disappointed in Ott quality control on this product and I probably will not buy Ott lamps again."
2,OttLite T59BNR Vero Paper Weight in Brushed Nickel,"I'm sure there are less expensive paper weights in the world - possibly even ones that illuminated desks for a week before deciding to relinquish that role. Within that framework, I made an awesome purchase. As far as reliably functional table lamps go, it's a piece of junk."
3,So-so book,"Most of the books my child (almost 5 and a girl) has are ones we both love to read, but she likes this one better than I do! Even so, it is not her favorite one, I think she likes the idea of a bunny getting married but it is kind of long and dull for smaller kids in my opinion. And if you are thinking it will help your small child understand how to be a flower girl, it might do an OK job but not as good as it might have if the writing were tighter and focused more on Emily's job as flower girl than the story as a whole. Not bad at all, but if your book funds are tight then look for this at the library or at the very least make it your ""free"" book using Amazon's promotion (4 for 3)."
3,Not what I was hoping for,I was hoping for a story about what being a flower girl was all about and what it meant. But instead this was more about them not being ready when the big moment arrived. This story more confused my 3 year old then helped her to understand about being a flowergirl. Its a cute story if all you want is a story but if you are trying to get a flowergirl ready for the big day I dont recommend this one.
4,Elf fanatic must have,"It's a pretty small book, more like a flip book, and some illustrations from the movie would have made it better, but it is full of one liners and great elf wisdom from the movie. If you love Elf, as much as my family does, buy it."
1,Did not work for me !,"For a month applying the product 4-5 times day I didn't have any change.Customer service is great,they will try to work with you and help you !ViliScottsdale,AZ"
1,bad product,I did the same as the previous review. No changes whatsoever. Paid $13 shipping and had to send back for refund. Still waiting on refund. Don't bother.
1,no results!,i tried this product and it didnt remove anything the bottle wasent event big enough to keep rubbing it on which i was constantly doing anyway i tried to make do with what i had and the moles didnt go anywhere.
5,hey..YO . ! .LOL,Hey pple ...for those who don't get it ..THIS IS UNDERGRUND STYLE NOT JUST RAP MUSIC..LOL ..love it
3,"The CD is halfway to ""Tha Bomb""","The cd is probably one of the better cd's I have listened to, but a couple of the songs aren't very good. I personaly like ""Don't Cry Dry Your Eyes"" the best. I also liked ""Nappy Heads"" quite a bit. Some of the songs I just plain did not like were ""Woman No Cry"" and the second version of ""Ready Or Not"" on the cd."
5,Rockin to Stone's Place,"If you are looking for a variety of sounds on 1 cd, Stone's Place is it. Each song has a unique sound and shows a different style of music. This was 1 of the few cd's I bought in which I liked every song and couldn't decide on a favorite."
4,Good,"They do seem to run about a half size big. Also, they seem a bit narrow in the toe area. Otherwise, they are cute and comfy once you break them in!"
2,Monster Maker,Boring. Jim Henson's t.v version was way better and more interesting. The kid in this book is such a whiny little brat you can't wait to get to the end of the book so you wont have to put up with him anymore. Basically nothing happens in the whole book except in the kids overactive imagination. Please smack him on the head with a reality stick!
2,"Good Percussion, Little Else","There aren't enough interesting ideas on this album to make it work. While I thought the percussive elements were compelling at times, this album sounds to me like four guys fooling around. Peter Buck in particular, whose rudimentary technique works fine on an R.E.M. album, sounds out of his league performing this somewhat more ambitious material."
5,Textbook perfect,"This book is THE textbook you would use if you took a course in collecting vintage jewelry. Leigh gives a definition and then shows you exactly what she is talking about, and she has made this learning interesting and easy. It is great for novice collectors, but even better for brand new collectors."
4,Great to start with,"The author makes this book a very easy and fun read for novice collectors. This is a must have if you are new to collecting jewelry. There are a lot of useful facts and a list of companies that have made famous costume jewelry over the years along with their years of production. Some of the definitions are basic, but perfect for new collectors. The book itself is being offered at a nice low price unlike a lot of other collector books."
1,Not Millennium,"The word Millennium might imply that we have some, either new work, a new way of playing older work but here we have neither. We have a vanity CD and nothing more. Don't waste your time. I'd suggest to our guitarist that he leave composition to the composers and performers to the performers and check himself on vanity. Last time I hear vanity was a sin. You must not take attention away from performers who are actually good and there are plenty of buyers of guitar music who may miss a chance of getting something worthy of a classical guitar CD or a guitar CD of any kind, for that matter by making the mistake of getting this one."
5,A wonderful book for children and their parents to read!,"It is time that we got back to teaching our children the basics of life -- love and kindness! This is a great book for parents to read WITH their children. What a better way to teach your children about life, than to read and learn with them.You should read her first book -- ""Putting the World to Sleep""This is a wonderful author!"
2,THE DESIGN OF THE STORY BECOMES CONFUSING.,"Attorney Elaine Taylor (Jennifer Grey), early in her career, is chosen by circumstance to represent a presumptive serial slayer, George Kendall (Costas Mandylor), a well-known photographer of prostitutes, some of whom happen to be the murder victims, whereupon Elaine becomes attracted by her client's possible innocence (as well as by his maleness), complicating affairs for all concerned since evidence to be exhibited by the local district attorney's office is purportedly enough to indict Kendall. The film is hampered by a confusing screenplay that confounds a fairly routine storyline, resulting in scenes being disunited and lacking in suspense, but Grey is always interesting to watch and performs creditably here, as does Currie Graham as procurer for the slain ladies of the evening, while cinematographer Curtis Petersen adds interest to the undertaking despite the script's flaws of continuity."
3,whoops,"I am the reader from near Boston whose review appears below--but that review is about the book ""Breathing Free,"" by Teresa Hale. These two books are on the same subject and even look a lot alike. My criticism of Hale's book and claims still stands, though."
2,Warped,"The drums are warped from factory, rear brakes pulsate when braking, will have take them in to get then turned and tru."
2,Print it Yourself Diane Ericson Frode,"Some of the older Ericson books are well worth buying. I have most of them and enjoy using them and browsing through them. But I would not suggest this one, for a couple of reasons: Everything in the book is available elsewhere, and more attractively presented. It is simple to the point of not being interesting.On the plus side: The directions are certainly easy to follow - if you can translate non-color into color in your head (no color is illustrations), and visualize what you might do with the techniques without any photos of finished garments to give you ideas, then you can most likely get by with this one. However, you don't need to, if you shop around a little."
4,Sweet Deal,"I love this camera. It's slim, cute, and not expensive for a digital camera. I've had no trouble with it at all, and it's easy to figure out where everything is- it's pretty simple."
2,Highly Disappointing,"I'm hoping the retailer will take the camera back. Pro's: It's small. Cons: The battery has a very, very short life. After 10-12 pictures, I can't count on it being ready for the next round of photos. Shutter lag is too long. I know that's the number one gripe of all digital camera owners, but this one seems to be worse than any one that I've had. Next Picture cycle time can also be really terrible. If you're looking to capture the moment, chances are you'll be capturing the moment AFTER the moment. Don't get it."
5,Great product !,"Specifically what I was looking for : a simple straightforward & very easy to use hi-quality camera,"
4,Good Family Fun?,"This EP made me laugh, made me cry, and sent me on an emotional roller-coaster. Alright, I'm lying. But this album is just plain head-shakin, pelvic groovin', hip-hoppin', b-bopping fun. Starting out with the hilarious and infectious You Will Be A Hot Dancer, which builds up to.... SHAFT! which is just absolutely crazy. I don't what the hell the song is about except that it gets me jumpin. Version is Ok, and Take Me To Your Leader is exceptionally cool. Then comes the wacky AZWETHINKWEIZ which is incredibly incredible. Hilikus is so-so but overall this a mad crazy must listen ASAP EP!"
4,Enjoy The View,This is Ep is easily one of the best from incubus.Because it is old incubus. And if you are fan of the new sound. then you may debate. unlike me who found incubus through their old sound (I love both there new and old sound)from Fungus Amongus then you should go ahead because it features 4 tracks from FA. and they are remastered with the help of a added DJ.this Ep is really good but if you didnt like Science then I wouldnt suggest this.because It is a step back and it does take sum adjusting to.But other then that this is a incubus Ep that should be heard before buying.Thats the only reason why I gave it four stars....
4,"GOOD, BUT SCIENCE IS BETTER...","IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING PURCHASING THIS CD, YOU SHOULD FIRST HAVE THE LATEST ALBUM (SCIENCE). I BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS A BETTER ALBUM WITH MORE MEANINFUL LYRICS AND HEAVIER GUITAR RIFFS. MOST OF THE SONGS ON ""ENJOY INCUBUS"" ARE COMPARABLE TO SONGS LIKE ""DEEP INSIDE AND ""SUMMER ROMANCE"". IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THOSE SONGS YET, THEY HAVE FUNKY JAZZ GUITAR PARTS AND BASS RIFFS THAT ARE BEST DESCRIBED AS PORN MUSIC. AS A CONCLUSION I WOULD SAY THAT SCIENCE IS A BETTER ALBUM BUT IF YOU WANT A MORE RELAXING CD THAT YOU CAN LISTEN TO ALL DAY, THEN THIS IS THE CD THAT YOU SHOULD CHOOSE."
5,A kickin' mix of sounds that is mind-blowning!,Incubus is the most original band I've ever heard in my life! I first heard these guys on Halloween at the '98 Family Values Tour and went out and bought their CDs the very next day. You can't go wrong with this CD.
4,great Movie!,I've seen this movie a few times and have to say I love it! the tension and drama on the senate floor at the end of the movie make it all worthwhile. This movie was my first intro to Otto Preminger as a director and I have watched many of them. Charles Laughton and Walter Pidgeon are great in this also.
5,DVD Advise and Consent,Thank you very much for providing exactly what I was looking for and in such an efficient manner
3,What does it really mean?,"I was not satisfied by the film, even being one of Otto Preminger's. such a fine director. Everything seems overacted, lacks of the necesary suspense, even though it has the homosexual ingredient, the film is not convincing. The corruption has existed in all countries and will go on. So what does this film give me? Pshhhhh. No, I do not recommend it. Except the magnificent performance of Charles Laughton. He was and will ever be a superb actor."
3,Overlong Political Drama With Fine Performances,"An all-star cast breathes life into director Otto Preminger's somewhat ponderous adaptation of the Allen Drury novel. ""Advise and Consent"" (1962) would have benefited from a tighter script, but Preminger makes the most of the Washington political environment. Worth seeing for Charles Laughton's splendid final performance and Burgess Meredith's memorable turn as a lying witness."
5,Outstanding,Fabulous cast. Wonderful political movie giving great incite into the workings of the Advise and Consent process and the Senate as a whole at a time when politics had a lot more give and take and compromise than the back stabbing of today. Highly recommended.
4,Good Political Thriller (Classoc),"It's like a ""good ole' actors reunion: Headed by Walter Pidgeon (I would say), he plays the BIG role (as he did). Good movie if you like(d) ""7 Days in May"", ""Manchurian Candidate"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" and the like. The 30's actiors up to the more recent 50's were either ""Jr Senator"" (ex: Peter Lawford), and a Sr.ex would be the great actors, too...Chas. LAughton, H. Fonda etc. Good Movie, but they did start showing it on TV - so if you aren't into these kinda movies, then forget it. I like them but, I go in suurts, too."
1,purchase of Advise and Consent in vhs format,"Extremely very poor quality of product. Picture not clear, unresolved tracking problems. Excellent movie from the 60's spoiled by product quality."
3,"How DC really works. As we know from today's Congress, it isn't ""warts and all,"" it's all warts. warts.","""Advise and Consent"" is a must for any collector of political drama. Warning: the DVD sound is faulty. I had the volume up to 100% and still had to strain to hear dialog as spoken by some of the superb cast, Burgess Meredith for one.Two actors give their characteristic magnificent performances: Henry Fonda and Charles Laughton. They give such life to their characters, the viewer wants to vote for one and tar and feather the other."
3,The Moslim Perception of the World,"Lewis has done the world a service in writing this book. Organized around various themes, like Religion, Economics, Science, the text takes the reader through numerous Euro-Muslim encounters, always stressing the Muslim side. It is all too easy for Europeans (and even easier for Americans) to see all of world history and culture from their own little corner of the world. What we too easily fail to recognize is that everyone else sees the world from their own corner.The avid reader of Islamic history will enjoy this text. For the less specialized reader wanting an introduction to the Muslim view of things Lewis' other books will be more useful. Too often Lewis provides a dozen examples when a few would suffice."
3,Tough sledding for the non-scholar.,"Though incredibly comprehensive, I'm afraid this book was a little too heavy for my recreational reading. I learned much, but about half way through I just began losing my concentration and interest. The book succeeded handsomely in familiarizing me with Islamic history and perspectives, but after a while, I just found myself getting bored. I'm certain that this is an estimable work about an important subject, by a formidable scholar, but I guess I just found the book a little too dry, too detailed and too pedantic."
3,a bit overwhelming,"Bernard Lewis has put together a great deal of information relating to the Muslim World and its relations to the Europe but there seems to be so much information placed into one book it can be difficult to figure out what exactly Lewis is trying to say in this particular book. The chapters are good because they deal with suth topics as the Muslim View of the World, Science and Technology and Cultural Life. He does provide some pretty detailed analysis of the relationship between the Muslim World and Europe but it seems like the book could have been split up into two or three seperate book in which he could have focused on particular areas of the topics in the Muslim Discovery of Europe."
4,A Helpful Perspective on the Muslim World,"The erudite Mr. Lewis allows the reader to learn when, why, and how the Muslim world began to take interesta in the West, rather than vice versa."
4,Early solo work by the singer from Brand New Immortals,"Had to do quite a bit of hunting to find this CD. Harris more than proved his talent as frontman for Brand New Immortals and their sole (to date) full-length CD ""Tragic Show."" Included on this solo CD is an earlier version of ""If I Had A Dime"", a song slightly improved upon on ""Tragic Show.""But his voice is so elegant and soulful that he would be almost any rock band's dream lead singer.The material on this CD is solid throughout, though perhaps without any real slam-dunk tunes. For those, check out ""Tragic Show."""
2,David Ryan Harris,"As much as I love David Ryan Harris, this CD just isn't that great. It sounds like he's still coming out of his formative stage. There's a reason he doesn't still sell this CD. Also, the CD I bought said Used --- Like New. Well the case was totally broken when it arrived. The CD wasn't even in the case and was fairly scratched, but it played fine. The condition was either misleading or it was shipped crappy. Either way it's the sellers fault."
4,Too Good To Be Slept On,It's certainly too bad that not enough people know about David Harris' first solo effort. The music and lyrics are well produced and aren't the same run of the mill drivel that is being produced nowadays.Those who knew David from Follow For Now will miss the hard driving guitars and general music to stage-dive by (I know I do) but David shows a mature side that will impress even those who are missing that aspect of the music.I certainly enjoyed this CD and only wish that more across the country knew of this musical diamond in the rough.
2,Apology for Capitalism,"This shrill Leftist whinge of course comes out pro-Capitalist in the end (a compromize which indeed we all end up making); and for one reason or another fails to locate the place from which Fascism can be seen to be a unified ideology (well, fairly unified -- even then some of its own internal logic is self-contradictory to a point that militates against its legitimate application)."
3,Biased TRASH,"This book clearly has some intelligent and insightful ideas, however most of it is ambiguous and biased junk. A book of this kinn should be based on fact and accurate history, not on speculation, and personal interpretation. Whats stood out to me most in this book is the description that Hood gives of Auschwitz. His charecterization is an insult to all of those who perished fighting against the Nazi war machine. Hood should have visited the camps before he went on this tirade of injustice."
4,The Mystery at the Dog Show,"The Aldens attend Greenfield's first dog show, where some trickster mysteriously shaves a prize-winning poodle and releases a cat in the middle of the show, and the Boxcar Children search for the culprit. Can the children solve the mystery and save the day?"
3,I'm glad I'm not the ONLY one!!!,"When I was in college, my roommate bought a copy of Return to Oz just for laughs. After watching it, we were talking about how it kinda freaked us out when we were little, which is weird since it's supposed to be a kids movie. Then I asked her if she remembered a creepy movie that played on the Disney channel about a kid who lost his hair and put peanut butter on his head to grow it back, only to have it grow too long. She new EXACTLY what I was talking about, and filled in the blanks about the machine and the painting. It creeped her out too, but she was wanting to see it again to see if it was a scary as she remembers. So I got a copy for her birthday, just for memories sake. All I can say is that there must be something very different about it for all of these people in the 22-26 range to remember it."
5,I'm not insane!!,"I remember watching this flick when I was about 10 years old over at a friend's house. This was a sit on the edge of your seat and hold your breath movie. At least at that age it was. However, as the years have gone by (I'm 25 years old now), I have found it nearly immpossible to find this movie. And of course my cohorts must be thoroughly uncultured, because it is even more remote to find someone who has actually seen or heard of this movie. So I'm in a record store a couple of years ago and decide to take a chance and see if they carry it or can order it and lo and behold..... This flick DOES exist!! And NOOOOOOOOO, they can't order and break my heart in telling me this. Now if only I can bide my time long enough to get my hands on a copy. My kids are gonna love it!"
3,"A great children's fantasy, a film everyone can enjoy","The peanut butter solution is a great tale that any child would like. It is humorous, adventure-filled and mysterious at the same time."
4,The peanut butter solution cult,I saw this movie when I was about 7 years old. Big mistake!! It has creeped me out ever since. I looked all over to rent it when I was about 17 years old. I finally found a copy and it still creeped me out. Now I am 23 years old and I am determined to buy this movie to put in my collection. Not one person I have asked has ever seen this movie. It is definetly too wierd and scary for a child to see. I am glad there are people out there who have seen this movie and feel the exact same way as I did.
4,One Crazy Dream!!,Oh my God..I totally thought that was a dream too!!!! I have never been able to figure out whether it was real or not until I came across the title on a movie trivia website and the title struck a chord with me! How crazy....I have buy it now!
5,OMG,"I remember this movie I was 8 years old and I saw it on beta max at my aunt and uncle's house all the time. I also recall having strange dreams after watching the movie. ""Hair Raising Comedy"" what ever more like ""Hair Raising Nightmare"". But Still love this movie."
3,I finally found it!,"I am now 22 and I have been searching for this movie FOREVER! I can remember watching it when I was extremely young and wondering if I had lost it! I remember this movie very vaguely and I remember it was really weird so I started to think I just dreamed it up! I have been searching for this movie because I can remember it left me with this weird feeling and I remember seeing a boy smearing peanut butter all over his head! Thats all I had to help me find the title of this movie!!! I just typed peanut butter in the VHS search and it came up. Finally, I can stop wondering!"
4,One of those low-quality movies that becomes a favorite,"Ok, Ok, this movie is not necessarily the best, and there are a few moments which might be tougher to watch for younger viewers, but I'll rate it high because it was one of those movies that just seem to stay with you for so long. I probably first saw it over 15 years ago. It had the strange mix of imagination and creepiness that appealed to me as a 10 year old. Despite watching it over and over it never really lost that strange magic that movies can have over kids (and that final song over the credits - sung by Celine Dion before she was famous - sticks even more strongly). If it were released on DVD, I'd probably pick up a copy, grab a bowl of popcorn, and relive some childhood memories."
4,"I, too, thought this movie was just a dream...","This is amazing...! I thought that I had this vivid dream from the 80s when I was a child that this little boy was kidnapped and his hair was made into paintbrushes and I remember it all being about peanut butter. Then I was talking to a friend in college and he said, ""Yeah, that's the Peanut Butter Solution!"" I couldn't believe it! I haven't seen the movie as an adult yet, but I will start looking for a copy. There should be some sort of group for all of us who have had this experience."
3,the peanut butter solution revisited,"when i was about 4 or 5 years old living in ohio i remember watching this movie with my parents and brother (who was 6 or 7). i was so traumatized by it that i was terrified of bald people for years to come. my brother, on the other hand, loved it though and had no problems watching it. i only vaguely remember bits and pieces of the film though, and i really look forward to seeing it again after all these years (i'm 20 now). the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because it was quite disturbing for me, but at the same time it's a movie that i will never forget for that very reason."
3,Scaaary,"I remember watching this video along time ago when I was around 5 years old. I am 20 now and still have the occasional nightmare.For years I would ask people about a movie were a kid got his hair scared off and used a peanut butter mixture that a coupla ghosts gave him, getting kidnapped so his hair could be used as paint brushes that brought the painting to life.When I asked people was called and they would tell me that no such movie existed and that I had dreamed it.After searching and searching I finally found the Peanut Butter Solution and knew I had not dreamed it after all.My suggestion...watch it before you let your kids watch it. Use your judgement if it is going to scare your kids or not."
1,Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My friend told me once about this movie she saw when she was younger about a bald kid who grew his hair too long because he put too much peanut butter on his head so he was kidnapped and had his hair made into paintbrushes. I thought she was psycho and said she probably made it up. Then she found it at a weird video store near our houses and she had me watch it with her to prove she wasn't insane and I was freaked out. This was the stupidest most disturbing movie EVER. The little girl wanting to be the movie and conspiring with her dad against her brother made me want to kill her and the Senoir dancing while he painted was awful and the little boy who wanted the solution for ""down there"" and who wanted his kidnapper to be his father to fool him into going bald. I think no children should ever be subjected to this. What were the directors on when they decided this was a good idea for a movie?"
1,Solution or Nightmare!?,"i don't understand why anyone would think this would make a good kids' movie. when i first saw it, i was so scared i couldn't sleep and even thinking about it now freaks me out. the thought of seeing something so scary in an abandoned house that you pass out and lose all your hair is beyond terrifying to me. the idea of getting kidnapped and having your hair used to make magic paintbrushes in a factory full child slave laborers is even worse. this movie really has it all.im writing this review because a few days ago, while on vacation, someone said something that made me remember it. the same old shiver and sleep deprecation is back. im buying this movie hoping that if i face my fears, they will go away, but i dont know. these scars just may be permanent.i try to explain it to my friends but they mock me. it's embarassing.edit: i was outbid on the movie and was so relieved that i decided i should probably never watch it again."
5,running trend....,"There seems to be a running theme here and on imdb.com's listing of this movie where people who have seen this movie as children thought the movie was a dream.Myself, I thought the plot of the movie was a nightmare i had. I actually thought my 'nightmare' had been a movie that i had recalled, but recounting my nightmare to people they said there was no way that was a kids movie.Then, I have a friend tell me about this movie, and like many evidentally, It freaked me out to realize it WAS a film, and I hadn't just made it up.This movie from what i remember is bizarre, to say the least but has made an impression on almost every kid who saw it. Not your normal kids movie.Oddly enough directed by the guy who made the landmark documentary Waiting for Fidel.Someone release this!"
1,Misleading photo,"Despite the photo showing 3 bundles of chews, if you order this item you will only get one bundle of under 50 chews. Too pricey for me - I returned them and will order something else."
2,Look elsewhere,"You don't get much for $15.97, that's for sure! And, to make it worse, for some reason the dogs don't like them--have given them to four dogs who LOVE rawhides, but these just sit. I should have returned them."
1,Misrepresented!,"The listing say made from US cows, cornfed. The PACKAGE says Made in Columbia.I have a hard time understanding how or why they would ship ""US cows"" to Columbia to make rawhide and who knows what else, then ship the product back??? The packaging led me to believe these were made in USA and they are not.American pets have died from eating foreign-made goods, so I will definitely pass on these.Please correct the listing!"
2,Twist stix,I am not pleased with the twist sticks. They are very thin and unevenly wound. I will go back to purchasing the ones WalMart has.
2,Too ambitious to be good,"Like others books in the Collection of Cambridge Companion, this volume on Locke's philosophy is too difficult to for new readers and too simple and general for scholars that already knows the basics of Locke's thought. Moreover, of the diffeents essays pubblied in this Companion, some are very usefull for a wide and general look. I think it's a good tool to graduate students looking for exapnding their knows on the political theory of XVIII century."
5,Invaluable!,"This book should be in any home where the love for God, family, country and humanity dwell in the hearts of the occupants!"
4,Love this book!,"I've had a copy of this book for years, and continue to refer back to it. I just bought my second on third copy because people keep borrowing it and failing to return it."
5,amazing,"this movie was awsome,I wanted a real horror gory movie that has the coolest monster of them all and i found it.The movie was so cool and so awsome the movie had no bad parts,it is just plain awsome."
1,One very reluctant star!,"This movie was truly terrible. I am still not quite sure what the film was about even though I wasted two valuable hours of my life trying to find out. I believe it had to do with a monster eating people in a museum. The highlight was definitely when the main characters started to die because I did not have to sit through any more of their insipid dialogue. Unfortunately my happiness at seeing them ""kick the bucket"" was somewhat tempered by the fact that it was utterly obvious it was going to happen. For the love of God, if you want to waste your time renting a movie with no point see Encino Man because even it is more socially relevant."
1,A WASTE OF MY TIME EVEN I DON'T DO ANYTHING!,RELIC IS THE MOST DISGUSTING PIECE OF WORK I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED AND IS FULL OF NONSENSE PLOT. I REGRET SPENDING TIME AND MONEY ON IT. DO NOT BUY IT!
4,More fun than you might think.,"This movie has been compared to Alien(&s;) and Predator(&2). Some would go so far as to say this movie is a ""rip off"" of those other works.That is pretty narrow minded, as this movie really does stand on its own; just like many other good flicks of the genre. The movie is based on the novel of the same title(ISBN: 0812543262), not the other way around as with so many novelizations of movies. It's a good book and worth a read, if that is your cup of tea.Anyway, the movie is a fun experience with good acting and a picture that is almost always interesting to watch.I especially loved the delicious little plot point of what one tribe of ""primatives"" did to an arrogant American Anthropologist who'd come to study their ""quaint"" little beliefs."
5,A Rollercoaster Ride Of Terror!,"I'd put this as probably the most frightening movie I've ever seen! Mysterious deaths are occuring at the Chicago Museum of Natural History, and when the night of a new exhibition opens a monstrous reptile wreaks havoc and terror and it's up to a Lt. D'Augusto, and Dr. Green to end its violent rampage. Fast and furious with slick scares at evey turn!"
1,One of the Dumbest Movies I've Ever Seen,"Do yourself a favor: buy and read the book. The book is terrifying. This movie is an embarrassment. The best character in the book (Special Agent Pendergast) was entirely deleted from the movie, and the dapper Japanese genius scientist who works with Margo was turned into a fat, bumbling Chinese guy. The part that especially disgusted me was when the museum beast was turned into a cartoonish 20 foot fireball galloping through the museum like Clifford, the Big Red Dog. I was as embarrassed as I was livid. What a waste! I guess it's a good thing that they left Agent Pendergast out, because they probably would have cast somebody like Keanu Reeves to play him, and that surely would have given me a stroke. I hope the authors got paid a million dollars, because their fantastic book was turned into a ridiculous joke."
2,A book not meant to be made into a movie,"For those who have read the Preston/Child novel, it is truly a masterpiece. It had incredible characterization, fascinating scientific topics, and tremendous suspense. Such a complex story that took over 400 pages to tell is not meant to be made into a movie. Sure, some books are, but this one is not. For those who are looking to watch a quality movie that presents abstract ideas and new concepts, this movie does not present that in the way the book did. For those who read the book and have high hopes of watching the amazing story Preston/Child wrote come to life, don't get your hopes up. There's just no way a movie could do what the book did. Valiant effort, but an impossible task!"
2,Ehh 1.5 stars,"The entire premise of the movie was stupid, and the more they tried to explain the creature's origin, the dumber it got. This isn't scary at all, but it is a good time waster. Don't expect to get scared in it though."
3,Nice upgrade from the DVD,"I'm going to review just the Blu-ray, briefly, since there are plenty of reviews of the movie itself. It's a nice visual upgrade over the original DVD, since the original suffered from significant compression and quality issues. The tones are overall rather dark, but the original film was this way so it's not a big deal. The edges are sharp and for $13 (the cost of the film as of this writing), you really can't go wrong if you're either buying for the first time or upgrading over DVD.The only disappointment, and it's a mild one, is that the disc is very very light on extras. There's a recent, and brief, interview with the director, some commentary, and not much else. Since this was one of the late Stan Winston's creature films, I'd have loved to see some documentaries of his work on the film, but alas it's not to be. Buy this for the film, and nothing else, since that's about all you'll be getting."
4,"didn't know there was a book, but I loved this movie.","I love monsters movies, and I can see that the reviews on this site have many mixed reviews. I am writing to let you know that this does fulfill my urge of getting my monster movie fix. Never did I think of similarities to Alien or Jurassic Park or any other while watching. I just purchased this movie for the second time. I wanted to replace my VHS copy with the DVD version. This is the kind of movie that I do enjoy watching over and over again, which is a lot more than I can say for many others. Well that is my two bits, hoped that helped."
1,Read the book,"Like several other reviewers, I read the book and was eagerly awaiting the movie. The problem is that the two works share very little. There are some superficial resemblances (the book takes place in a museum in New York, the movie in a museum in Chicago, some of the characters in the movie have the same names as characters in the book, but in several cases the resemblance ends there) but this movie is not a translation of the book into film. Among other things, it leaves out Pendergast, one of the three major characters, and possibly the most fascinating character in the book. It also handily manages to kill off the character who helped make the sequel to the book possible.I'd love to see the book _The Relic_ made into a movie. This movie, however, isn't it."
4,Penelope Ann Miller and hormones,"A ship that was supposed to transport some crates from South America to a museum seems to have a crew that lost their heads. The crates finally get flown in. One full of goodies the other just leaves. The museum's Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) is suspicious. Everyone else is happy until a guard seems to have misplaced his hypothalamus. Looks like Dr. Margo Green is about to be consumed by her work.This is a pretty spiffy well done formula movie. As with many contemporary movies they completely ignore the book and add all the standard clichés. We have the ruthless rivalry, missing scientists, and mysterious crates. Naturally no one does what they are supposed to do and you start rooting for the, lets just call it a, relic."
3,buy the book,"If you really want a good story, buy the book. There is so much more to the story than what the movie showed. The only thing the movie had in common with the book was that the story took place in a museum and there was a monster. Do yourself a favor; read don't screen."
2,Stick with the book ... trust me.,"A major disaster that should have been left in the glorious print where it was born. The Preston-Child book is a classic horror/thriller and this movie does it no justice.Possibly ok for a boring night, but that's it. Stick with the book and skip buying this one, unless you're a Preston-Child fanatic and want it to be able to say you have it.2 STARS FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR DVD's."
4,"Overlooked, but really good ...","1997R: Excellent, overlooked dark monster movie that has something for all the smart people among us who can still find enjoyment in a movie without having read the book! MFJLabs 4x"
3,"dark, dark, dark, they all go in the dark..","I really like the movie, but the problem here is the awful transfer. The Relic has to be the only dvd I own where the picture quality of the trailer actually outshines that of the film. As this has been released on Blu-Ray, one hopes that the transfer would be better, but as I don't own a Blu-Ray player that doesn't really matter to me. Much of the film takes place at night, inside a museum with the lights out, so being able to see what little there is to see is of major importance. Unfortunately, Paramounts negligent treatment of it's own product does nothing but annoy fans of this overlooked, clever creature feature. 2006 release version"
1,The Eggplant that ate Chicago,"Haven't read the book, so can't compare, but The Relic on film is simply pathetic. Yes, it's a monster movie. The problem is, this movie is no better than most of its genre, and worse than some. The monster looks like a refugee from one of the Star Wars episodes. The acting and dialogue are terrible. What a yawner!"
1,I can't believe I watched the whole thing,"I rented this video from my local shop a while back expecting nothing more than simple entertainment, a monster movie that would be fun on a Saturday night. Boy, did I make a mistake. This is a dreadful mess. There is little or no suspense developed, the creature is unbelievable, and the last quarter of the film is so ridiculous that it should be silly but is just tedious. This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently."
1,And another derivative Alien rip-off,"The Relic starts off promising enough, but by it's halfway point it becomes a predictable and routine creature feature with a just plain bad CGI animated monster and plot holes aplenty. Not to mention, what is up with the lighting? The film is so dimly lit that it's hard to tell just what is going on and who is who, and the cast (featuring Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, and Linda Hunt) is beyond wasted. The Relic does have some good gore effects and a good jolt here and there, but it's nothing worthwhile at all. Like the above Amazon review states, you should do yourself a favor and watch the original Alien and it's first sequel Aliens to see a monster fest done right, and leave the Relic with the horde of other derivative Alien rip offs on the shelf."
3,all right as a stand alone thriller,"Do yourself a favor and don't read the book before seeing this. The book is at least twice as good, and the movie leaves out the most likeable character from the book. Still, Tom Sizemore makes the perfect cop hero, which actually is similar to the novel."
2,Awful BD...,"If you watch this Blu-ray on a small plasma or LCD HDTV it may look okay but I can guarantee if you are projecting on a 120"" screen you are going to hate this version. I was hoping that somehow the producers would find a way to brighten the image enough to make details missing on the already too dark DVD visible but alas the original dark cinematography of the movie can not be remedied. The sound was okay although I felt the dialogue was too low comparable to the cranked up sound effects. All in all a big disappointment."
2,Monster in the Dark,"RELIC has always been one of my guilty pleasures. And on Blu Ray!! How could it fail? Umm--Lionsgate has delivered one of the murkiest prints of the year. The images are so dark--one simply doesn't know the difference between the monster, Linda Hunt, Sizemore and Penelope. Stan Winston received kudos for monster design. But!! You simply cannot see it in the murk of this print. Even the laserdisc and vhs copies of the film are better than this alleged Blu Ray. Sound is a bit better with some nice effects/musical jolts. But!! Save your dollars. This Relic is a relic. Director Pete Hyams has a commentary. I wonder if he was watching the Blu Ray or a 35mm print. If the Blu Ray--his comments could not match the images on the screen--merely because he couldn't see them!"
4,"So, it's not a Scorcese film....","But, ""The Relic"" is a pretty good monster flick. I, like other reviewers, did read the book and found the film's departure from much of the novel to be a little annoying. However, the film does hold one's interest, especially with the great monster ""effect,"" a cross between ""Predator"" and a dragon, and the heroism and resourcefulness of the Penelope Ann Miller character.There are two truly memorable scenes: 1) the creature ascending onto a SWAT team member as he attempts a rescue and 2) the ""revelation"" by the creature of its true identity. The latter was excised from the network showing, depriving the audience of one really kinky moment."
4,The Relic,"I have recently read Douglas Preston and lincoln Childs ""Relic"" and i loved it. Then I heard that there was also a movie that was made so I was very excited to see that. When I did i loved it. It scared the @^#% out of me. The monster was very cool. This has to be one of my favorite movies. There are a few things that i don't like about the movie however. One thing is that they got rid of the best characters: Pendergast, you know that FBI agent. Another thing I didn't like was that the lighting in some parts was terrible. IT was effective but frustrating at times because you couldn't see everything. Another thing that I did like was that the movie used lines from the book. This was a very good movie if you like horror films and don't mind a lot of gore thenn this is the movie for you."
1,How to turn gold into lead,"The authors of this movie have managed in reversing the alchemist's dream: tehy had gold (the book ""RELIC"") in tehir hands and they turned it into vile lead (This movie). Frankly, if I was Lincoln Child or Douglas Preston I would sue the movie company (but then again, I suppose I wouldn't, having sold the rights...): there is nothing, repeat NOTHING of the brilliance of RELIC in this movie. It's just a nonsense splatter with a ""monster"" tale, while the book had it all: a very intriguing setting, a brilliant plot, suspense, a beautiful twist end. In this movie the ""beast"" is ridiculous, something from an old Japanese B-Movie, and even ""the museum"", wich was so fascinating and scaring in the book, is just an ordinary building. Awaitng for something like the book, I was really, REALLY disappointed form this movie! Let's hope they'll make better use of Cild/Preston's other novels..."
1,Worthless,I was disapointed when I realized that I could not play this on the Bluraydvd player that i now have. This should have been stated before I made the purchase.
2,Such a Waste,"I really looked forward to seeing the film adaptation of the terrific book. What a huge disappointment. First they moved the setting to Chicago. Why change the setting from the dark, creepy, magical NY Metropolitan Museum? Then they removed Pendergast. What were the writers/producers thinking to eviscerate such a fine book, such a wonderful character? They could have made this film the start of a franchise instead of a lackluster monster film. What was left was okay, but nothing close to the imaginative source."
4,Fantastic Dan and Bugster say,"This is one hell of a creature feature. It may not be much on the horror side, but for monster action this movie can't be beat. There are some startling moments but nothing too terrifying. And the monster... This thing'll tear you up faster than a kleenex at a snot party. its one of the coolest monsters in modern horror. In your face Blair Witch."
2,too dark!!!,"I'm baffled to see so many rave reviews. OK, the movie is not really bad, but it leaves so much to your imagination, because for some reason, maybe the transfer, I don't know, it is absolutely dark most of the time. You can't see a thing!!! If you insist, well...good luck!"
4,"Grab a can of pop, some chips and sit back & enjoy the movie","This is a great monster/creature movie for a rainy afternoon. The movie takes place in Chicago's Field Museum with towering great halls, dark corners and sub-basements that have sub-basements. People start to disappear and the police begin to search the museum. As the gala opening night of a major exhibition approaches and the body count goes up museum officials try to downplay any possibility of danger to the invited guests. Of course an uninvited guest literally drops in with the idea of dining on Society's Upper Crust.The movie was based on the book ""Relic"" by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. The book was more gruesome than the movie and I couldn't put it down until the last page even though I had to go to work the next morning. Preston and Child have written several books since Relic, set in various locales, and each with a new twist.These are books I don't loan out, I read them again and again."
2,Monster a wonderful actor,"The humans, not so much. Fun shots of Chicago's iconic Field Museum, especially Lake Shore Drive before it evoled...the leads flat at North avenue Beach. A pity."
2,Easy Money,"This box set is from a company based in the Netherlands which has issued at least three compilations (under the same name ""Good Morning Vietnam"") of 3 CDs each. The collections are not related to the film of the same name."
2,Pass on this one,While this collection is loaded with great songs the versions offered here are ones never heard on radio and are badly mixed. You will be disappointed.
4,Refreshing! Innovative!,It's refreshing to hear an artist talented enough to write great material and play well. I really have enjoyed all the moods of this CD. I recommend it to anyone who favors this genre of music.
4,Think! Before You're Knocked Off Your Feet!,"More than any other, Louis Nizer, who would become chief legal council for the Motion Picture Industry in the U.S., passionately argued for American intervention in Nazi aggression in the 1930's and 1940. Students interested in understanding and articulating the Nazi threat read Nizer religiously. One student who was preparing for a debate at the Yale Political Union on U.S. intervention in the fall of 1940 was William Garner ""Ted"" White who purchased a copy of Nizer's book, Thinking on Your Feet, as preparation for his part in the debate. White was George Herbert Walker Bush's tail gunner on the Barbara II that went down in the Pacific. White, who supported U.S. intervention against the resistance of the fortunate sons of many of America's industrialists domiciled at Yale and whose families were making fortunes off of material and weapons sales to Germany, didn't make it home."
1,NOT a family movie,"Read reviews & can't imagine ANYONE who would say this was a family movie. Adultery, sleeping around, & dysfunction at every hand. I turned it off well before the middle of the movie. Save your money."
2,Corny,"Usually, when I watch this kind of movie it's because I'm lazy and don't want to have to think. It helped me pass the time, but it was highly predictable."
1,Disappointed,So excited that there was a DVD on Uncle Floyd because it was funny back in the 80's but this DVD wasn't. There were so many funny clips that we remembered and none if them were in it. The only good thing was that Oogie was in it.Save your money
1,Nextstar 6 SE,"I bought this telescope in June. The mount had some issues and had to be repaired, twice. Celestron finally got it back to me. This scope is spetacular. The optics are top notch, the focus is crisp and not fussy, and the tracking is stable even when changing it's balance by switching an eyepiece for a CCD camera. I was able to image with my Starshooter II on my first night."
1,They were inferior goods.,"They were inferior goods.A mailing cost becomes higher than the price for goods returning the goods, and it is in the end.He went into the large red and I am troubled."
1,Celestron 6 SE,"Two problems:1. Would not GOTO properly, never could get an object in the FOV no matter which type of alignment I tried. I have other Celestron scopes, and their GOTO performance is great, but not this 6 SE model.2. Grinding noise from gears. I have another Celestron scope, and I know the sound of normal gear movement. Maybe this gear problem accounts for the poor GOTO performanceSent it back for full refund."
4,Great scope.....but.....,"It's a great scope and can be made better with upgraded objective lenses. That said, this is advertised as a Black Friday deal, but there is absolutely no discount whatsoever. Just the same ""mark it up to mark it down"" stunt one expects this time of year. The prices are uniform across the web."
5,really nice instrument,"This is my second nexstar scope. My first was a six years old refractor. This one is a vast improvement. Optical quality is excellent, the tripod is rock solid, and the sky align technology can't be beat. Also, the quality of the included eyepiece is really nice.For the reviewer who thinks it should ship with such accessories as a carry bag, etc...well, in a perfect world, yes, but none of the other major telescope vendors include such things. Until it becomes competitively necessary for them to give away for free what is now a lucrative accessory market, they won't.Nice scope. You won't be disappointed. Good mix of optical quality and portability"
4,"Good selections , EXCELLENT accompaniments!","Even after a year of heafty exploring in the genre of musical theatre, I feel as though I have only brushed the first layer off and have dozens more to go. PErhaps this is why I can't appreciate this more. The book's not bad at all, I just don't know most of these songs!HOwever, when it comes down to it, I have to say the arrangements here are FABULOUS! Songs from Phantom, Les Miz, and Jekyll and Hyde(all my favorites) are arranged well for solo performance, and my particular favorite ""IN his Eyes"", though it does not contain the gorgeous duet part or characters, makes it easy to pick and change to a solo piece. In fact the arrangement is ten times better than the actual song book version.Overall, definitely a great book to own; highly recommended from a theatre geek!"
5,A great series,"It's best to purchase all 3 of each anthology - I find Vol. 2 to be the best selection, but since each song is in the original key, it's a far cry from the pablum of typical ""vocal selections"" available. The only drawback - all the good audition pieces are showing up in these, and now everything's getting overused! :P"
4,A good book of musical theater songs,"I'm a teenager and I'm using Musical Theater Anthology volume 3 as one of my books in voice lessons. It contains musical theater songs that some people might not have heard of, but all the songs are very good. At the same time it includes many well known songs. My only complaint is some of the accompianment is a little strange and some of the keys of the songs are weird. Other then that its a great book!"
3,Richard Rust's Shades,"So here we have a characterization comparable to Richard Widmark's in Kiss of Death... and yet, obviously, Richard Rust did not receive the promotion one needs to be noticed! But I noticed. And when someone said to me, ""Check out Cliff Robertson's white suit"", I said, ""I didn't even notice him, I was looking at Richard Rust..."" Not that everyone else in this film wasn't good, but from the putting on of shades to the turning a zippo in his hand, from his coldness in killing a child to his creepiness in saying he likes lifeguarding for children, from his great profile to his screen presence...here's an ACTOR! As Sadakichi Hartmann said about himself, Richard Rust must have been too great to be noticed. But I saw him. Thank goodness!!"
4,Difficult packaging,"I'm not here to discuss film content, which is probably excellent. I am here to discuss the difficult packaging which plagues this set. Not only are the DVDs stacked on top of each other in twos, but the lower discs have edges that are positioned BELOW the spindles!I had major difficulty sliding the four lower DVDs out without breaking them (I did crack the outer packaging twice). I should have pushed down on the lower release button BEFORE attempting to slide the discs from underneath the spindles. I'm neither adroit nor mechanically minded, so the packaging was a challenge to me. Others will probably have less trouble than I experienced, as long as they are careful.I still hate this packaging, and would rather have slim cases in a wraparound. That would avoid the potential for breakage that I described above.The film transfers look quite good for the most part."
4,Good 'Film Noir' Stuff,"Written, directed and produced by Sam Fuller, this is a tough, straight-talking, no nonsense film noir. It's ike a 1940s noir but it's 1961 instead. So, instead of the boxy cars, of the Forties you have long- finned late 1950s automobiles. Otherwise, it''s the same genre.You get the same great film noir photography with lots of nighttime shots and a lot of tough characters. I just wish they had at least one really likable person to root for, but I didn't find any. The ""hero,"" played well by Cliff Robertson, is a tough, revenge-obsessed guy and that's basically the storyline as he tracks down the hoods who beat up and killed his father.Even though the rest of the cast doesn't have big names, many of the faces are familiar and all are good actors. This is an earlier ""Point Blank"" film seven years before that came out - same kind of story.Of the women in here, I found Dolores Dorn the most interesting."
2,Disappointing,"I was rather excited about reading this book as a simple, easy way to learn more about one of history's most intriguing figures. In the end, I was rather disappointed. The book was not particularly well-written and did not flow well. Worse yet, the author failed to portray Elizabeth as a strong leader and more like a weak, frail queen subject to her lusts and relying almost entirely on her advisors for ruling. The plot did not really explain while Elizabeth never married, despite several love affairs and extreme pressure to do so to protect the throne."
3,Mixed feelings...,"The book is broken up into sections ""Parts of my History"" as described.-Bastard-Virgin-Queen-Bellona-GlorianaPerhaps its just the subject matter, but after about a month, I gave up on finishing it. I could not get past ""Bellona."" The first two parts were excellent, but I had to force myself to get through Queen. Miles shows Elizabeth as determined to gain the throne all through the first two parts, and then when she finally recieves her much awaited position, is it JUST me or does the author portray her as some ninny that went and hid behind her advisors while she day-dreamed of ""Sweet Robin."" Yea, whatever.I haven't even read Philppa Gregory's soon to be released ""The Virgins Lover"" from what I can understand it is about Elizabeth's first few years of Queen. I can already guarntee you that will be better, also, grab Jean Plaidy's ""Queen of this Realm"" much, much better."
2,Simpering at best,"I have to agree with the reviewer (Delamaine?) I have about 70 pages left, which is the only reason I will finish this book. And I am in no hurry. I was expecting something with a lot more insight into how England's greatest monarch faced all her challenges. Instead most of the book harped on her relationship with Robert Dudley. It came across as a simpering romance. There were some interesting moments about Robert Cecil, the brains behind the thrown. The next time I want to read and learn about a historical figure, I will stick to history writers and away from fiction."
3,Indifferent,"I just finished the book and am feeling indifferent. There were but maybe a dozen awesome chapters. About three quarters the way through I started to get annoyed by the phrase ""Oh my lord. Oh my sweet lord"" every other paragraph.I did like how you are with her from childhood to the end of her reign and you remember that such as when she recollects memories of people she knew when she was younger and now sees grown. I did get a little confused, but not completely lost as to which character was which seeing as how there were multiple Robins and Roberts.The book did stay true to the end with it being in first person.I just thought it was lacking a little suspense. At no point in the book did I feel like I couldn't put it down, so if you are looking for something neutral I would recommend this book."
2,"Was E R really a simpering, vapid woman?","Argh, as a reader of historical fiction I was really looking forward to this book and it is only about 30% actual history and the rest is Elizabeth's vapid moaning about (a) men she loves, (b) men who love her, (c) catty other women, (d) men she loves, and so on. By the end of the book (around age 60) she is showing herself as a ruler who is being led by her heart, not her mind, with consequences for England that were not the best.Due to the excessive discussions of love and romance in this book I'd be more tempted to classify it as a romance novel than historical fiction."
4,A good read,"I love historical fiction, and this was a good read. However, I agree with other reviewers that you really need to be somewhat familiar with Elizabethan history to follow all the characters and events in this book. I also thought it focused a little too heavily on her love interests -- there was more to Elizabeth than that!"
3,I was unimpressed,"""I, Elizabeth"" did not meet my expectations. I am a fan of historical fiction, but I much prefer the work of Margaret George and Philippa Gregory to that of Rosalind Miles. This novel is interesting because it covers Elizabeth I's entire life and goes into a lot of detail about Tudor history. However, I thought the writing was very dull at times and I never really connected to Elizabeth's character the way I should have. I suggest reading ""The Virgin's Lover"" instead."
2,Don't bother,"As an amateur buff of Renaissance history, I really disliked this book. I found a historical error part way through which bothered me quite a bit. I also couldn't stand Elizabeth how she fawned over the men in her life, as well as how catty she was to other women, or the lack of regard to other political happenings. She was dull and whiny and by the descriptions you'd think she never ate ever. While some of the descriptions about her clothing were very good, there was no mention as to why her clothing was so ornate. (ie, the grander the clothing, the grander the persons station) This book as a whole was entirely too long. Don't bother buying this book."
5,LOVE.IT...LOVE.IT,I needed a jacket to walk the dog in temperatures ranging 40-50 degrees F. It is absolutely perfect! I can wear a plain t-shirt and throw on this jacket with a pair of sweat pants and I'm absolutely toasty. I bought a small and its still big enough to put on a sweater underneath. It was a great buy. I think my boyfriend will be buying the same jacket for men very soon.
4,You'll laugh your BASS off,"Tongue in cheek lyrics about bass fishing and other Bubba activities in a rap parody style. The music sounds more like Southern rock...but has a good back beat and bass--Title track very good, ""Hook 'em up"" is very funny about two guys with a Ford and a Chevy truck. ""Bill Dance Rap"" would be funny for a fan or a fisherman. It's a cool CD to listen to in the truck on your way to the lake or a tournament...get's you fired up. My kids love dancing to the music.I saw a music video of the cover song that had Bill Dance in it with the 2 Redneck Rappers. Very funny. It was a group therapy session about a guy who was an admitted ""Bassaholic"". Saw it at a couple of boat shows and Bass Pro Shops. Very funny."
3,Not Bad,"The Indigo Girls, I think, hit their pinnacle with Rites of Passage. It would seem that the craft of the song has some to do with the meter and control of the introspection. I don't feel I learn anything new from listening to the recent CDs of the Indigo Girls, but they still have a remarkable and unique sound that puts them high on the music food chain. Even if their whining about not being taken seriously as artists is a little annoying considering the huge following they have and will continue to have in the future.Well, if you are new to the Indigo Girls, check out any of their albums. You might like what you hear."
4,"A strong, thoughtful effort.","This album is composed of the kind of stuff that you don't hear on typical corporate radio.. thought provoking, introspective, and beautiful. The album bogs down at times, but redeems itself completely with the end track, ""Hey Kind Friend"".. as another reviewer mentioned, definitely an underrated track, and one of the strongest songs that IG has ever written. Leeds and Hey Kind Friend make this album, and they ""shine like the sun."""
2,A Strange Departure May Not Be the Best Idea,"This most recent of the Indigo Girls' studio albums is certainly a break from the folk-style music that made them so popular in the first place(not to mention winning them a Grammy or two), but the addition of the electric guitar and much more brash, overt lyrics made them not only less powerful to the heart and mind, but occasionally painful to the ears, as well. There are a few good songs here, notably ""Don't Give That Girl a Gun"" and ""Shame on You"", but all in all, this is the one Indigo Girls album that utterly falls flat. Granted, it's still the Indigo Girls, which makes it better than most of the new music out there, but I expected more from this abundantly-talented duo."
2,They've been better,"I applaud their attempt to break into a new music scene - essentially electric. But this album is to produced, to executed - not the raw sound of their previous albums. They seem to be lacking in their lyrics as well as their music."
1,What in the world were they thinking...Artists!!!,"The Indigo Girls going electric are on the same line as Michael Jordan's feeble attempt at playing baseball. The similarities are uncanny. If I wanted to hear electric, I would pop in Van Halen or Boston. I am an extremely big music fan with well over 800 cd's in virtually every style of music and, with the exception of a few selections on this cd, it is garbage. It is so disappointing when these artists cross the bounds that made them rich and famous. So many have lost there fans due to ""creative expression"". As Michael Jordan eventually did, go back to your roots IG and you will be on top again."
2,They should limit ALL of these editions,"In fact, they should take existing albums off the shelf. The Indigo Girls are not very good outside their genre. Their move into rock 'n' roll is like Mercedes producing a Chrysler...what were they thinking?"
2,Not their best work,"I have been a big fan of the IG for many years now, and find great songs and new things to be excited about with each new album. Sadly, this one is the exception to that rule. I get the impression that they were trying to hard to achieve a ""departure"" from their norm, with the more electric, harder-edged sound, more overtly political lyrics, and those very strange backup vocals. If you're a diehard fan looking for some of their more experimental stuff, this is the album for you-- otherwise their are better choices, both older and newer."
4,Love the Indigo Girls!,"This truly is a dynamic duo of vocals. Their lyrics rip through the heart of all the tragedies and triumphs of love and relationships, along with whatever deck of cards the world has dealt you. Great CD! Make sure you get their holiday CD as well-""Happy Holly Days""!"
5,Yet another great album!,The Indigo Girls continue on with their great music. This album contains some interesting changes to their sound that they use in their own unique way. If you're at all an Indigo Girls fan this is a must buy.
5,"Different, but good","If you're a big fan of all the classic In.Girls stuff, this CD might jar you a little. But once you listen some more, you'll grow to like it. Lots electric guitar and crazy backup singers make for some different sounds -- a welcome change, even for those of us who can't stop listening to the old-school harmony of the previous albums. Make sure to listen to the last few tracks -- nos. 11 and 12 are two of my favorites."
2,The Girls ain't what they used to be...,"I've been an IG fan for a long, long time now, but I really don't like this album much. They seem to have forgotten that you can write a really great song using just a few chords and a couple of guitars. I also think that as their lyrics become more ideological, the music becomes less accessible. It's not a matter of whether or not one agrees with the statements made; I, personally, just don't care for politics on my stereo. I think the Alternative/Lilith Fair crowd will like this album a lot... but I'm interested to hear what other long-time fans think of it."
2,Better luck next time...,"Being a fan who can sing every line forwards and backwards, I was disappointed with this album as a whole. Still, the song ""Leeds"" is 'poetry in motion' and once again my hat goes off to Emily's talent as a modern bard. ""Get out the Map"" is certainly worth mentioning, but all in all, I can only hope that their next album will take a turn for the better."
1,Mislabeled Product,The audio cassette version of this product being sold is not the full product. It only includes some of the tapes. This product is incomplete. Be careful before ordering it. I ordered through a reseller as well as through Amazon directly and ended up with the same problem both times.
4,great introduction to spoken Amoy Hokkien,"This text is a great start to learning Amoy Hokkien (a Chinese dialect very similar to Taiwanese as spoken in Taiwan). Unfortunately the text is somewhat dated, but then again I would think that you could learn effectively from this or the courses sister volumeSpoken Taiwanese, and simply learn to correct your speech to the modern norm quite easily. After all, if you have all the grammar and vocabulary you need, and understand the language, you should be able to modify it based on how you hear others talking. The base grammar and vocabulary of any language doesn't change that quickly.As far as my review of the lessons, please see my review ofSpoken Taiwanesehere on Amazon."
4,Great Pics,"The plot is a little thin compared to the richness of The Cricket in Times Square. But the pictures are great, and worth the price alone."
5,marvelous. A parent's review.,"I like this even better than George Selden's ""The Cricket in Times Square."" This is a much shorter book, but Chester Cricket gets out of the subway and goes to see New York City! He gets to the Planetarium and the Museum of Natural History, he goes to Central Park and the Empire State Building, he crosses Broadway and flies to the Statue of Liberty.If you're going to New York City, get this book for your kids. It's fun."
3,Hi,This is a preety good book. I know it can have better details. All of his other books are great! I just love them!
4,Letters from the Past,"""A Lady's Life on a Farm in Manitoba"" by M. G. C. Hall was an enjoyable, easy read. A series of letters from Mary Hall to an unknown person back in England of her 6 month trip which included visiting her brother in Manitoba as well as people whom she met coming over or in her travels. It is a step back in time to read first hand accounts of frontier life and descriptions of landscapes/scenery. A quick read - took me about 2 1/2 hours in total. There are very few typo errors (an ""I"" inserted here and there, some symbols where there should not otherwise be). A sit down with a cup of tea in your backyard on a sunny day kind of book."
4,Be careful what you ask for,"I like the Pimsleur system. I have used it with Traveler's Spanish, the Spanish I, and this set for French. I prefer the cassettes to the CDs becasue of they are easier back up so as to retrace areas. The concept of listen/repeat in your car on the way to work without alot of book-study at the lower levels is effective, easy, fun.The purpose of this particular French set of 4 cassettes is to provide an introduction into the Pimsleur system to see if you like the system and want to move directly up to the larger Level I set.If you are planning to use this set to get ready for a trip to France, this may not be the correct set for you. If you will only be in Paris two days or less, this might be OK. But if you are going to be there 3 days or longer, or if you want to brush up on your high school French, then pass over this set and go for the Traveler's Edition set, which is specifically designed for those purposes.It works, its fun, get the right one."
1,Great idea - very bad French accent,"I am studying French formally, but picked this up for a two-day road trip, hoping to practice my French.It would have worked, except that the French speaker in these is obviously a non-native. It's French with a very bad American accent - I actually couldn't listen to it - was too afraid I'd screw up the French pronunciation I'd already learned.This seems to happen a lot with foriegn language audio. But c'mon, how hard is it for these guys to hire native speakers?Final Review - Good idea, Good price, Bad execution"
2,way too expensive,There are cheaper options.. I should have spent more time researching cheaper products. My next order will be a lot less cost per unit.
4,Gorgeous,"I love these shoes, but they are painful to wear with bare feet. Blisters! They are so adorable, I overlook the fact that they have dangerously-slippery-smooth bottoms. They make my feet look tiny! I'm ok with that."
2,Toe box is too small.,"They look good on the screen, but in reality the leather is stiff and cheap looking. I'm a consistent size 8M with average arches, toes, etc. These felt too small in the toe area, and after a few minutes, my toes felt cramped, and my big toe hurt. I tried a few more times, then I ended up donating them. Not worth it."
4,It Was Good But....,I learned some about pigs in this book but... have you ever tried to render your own lard??This book says just to boil pig fat in water for awhileThat won't make lardTook me four tries to finally get it rightPractical experience taught me more than this book
5,RAISING PIGS,"RAISING PIGS READ IT FROM COVER TO COVERLIKED IT VERY MUCH GAVE ONE EACH TO TWOGRAND SONS,SO THEYWOULD HAVE IT FOR REF."
5,good stuff,i screwed them up by cutting them way too much and could not turn the front wheels anymore as the car settled too lowended up putting chopped springs from another manufacturer on my dragster
4,"Very important message for our times, for any person.","The message is that there is much more to life than just monetary gain. It is a terrific book for anyone that is searching for meaning, recovering after a loss or trauma, or frustrated with society's value system. The book is filled with quotes from all types of intellectuals, comedians and other profound speakers throughout the ages. It is very entertaining."
3,Very informative,Finally someone comes along and writes the true story of Pocahontas. My children thought that Pocahontas was just a thing of Disney's imagination until I bought this book. They learned all about the real John Smith and the true feelings of the early couple. A great book.
3,First-hand reports from a neglected corner of the peace,"Volume 3 of the First Series of Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939, edited by E.L. Woodward and Rohan Butler, deals with British diplomacy in Eastern Europe and Russia in 1919. It's divided into three chapters: the first deals with the German withdrawl from the Baltic states; the second with British involvement in Russia, including the Allied intervention; and the third addresses the negotiations at Versailles as they related to Eastern Europe.The DBFP series is a comprehensive cataloguing of memoranda, telegrams, and other official documents from the British foreign office. It's not a particularly exciting read on its own, but it can be an extremely useful resource for researchers and writers. Specialized historians and libraries probably ought to have a copy."
4,not bad,too sensitive....light and beep is going on even at 20 v. Anything else is ok. Useful thing for everybody. Fluke is fluke.
4,It's hot or not,"This is all this this tool is designed for. You touch the wire, and it indicates if there is voltage present. That's it. If you wanna know how much voltage is there buy a real meter. Just make sure you know how to use this voltage tester, and/or meter before working on a live circuit. The money you save now may not be worth your life."
5,Great product,"Great for residential, commercial or industrial. I bought this for my job in commercial/industustrial environment. I ve dropped it off ladder, water and still works. No problems. High quality cheaper than retail."
4,Be Safe,Good tool to check for power but I would double check with a meter before putting my hand on something.
4,Fluke non-contact voltage tester,The product was as described and so far functions fine. It gives me a fast read if the line I am going to work on is hot. I still back up testing a line with another tester.
4,Nice tester,"Nice tester without having to touch a wire. Light helps a lot but a buzzer would be more helpful. I believe Fluke makes one with a buzzer, go with that one instead."
1,Inconsistent results - untrustworthy,"I selected this tester because of all the positive reviews, but found it to be very unreliable. I removed the cover from a ""hot"" light switch and placed the unit near the hot wire and it correctly glowed red and beeped. So far, so good. Unfortunately, subsequent attempts to get the tester to glow again with this same hot switch were unsuccessful. I tried every possible angle and position, but just could not get the unit to glow. However, if I turned around and tested a nearby duplex, it correctly glowed.I trust that if this glows and beeps, voltage is detected. However, if it remains silent, I have no idea if the power is on or off. Too bad. It seemed like such a great safety checker to have in my electrical tool box."
3,"works ok, but it is not very sensitive","the probe tip needs to be almost right on the specific hot wire, practically touching it.That is a nice feature if you really are looking for a hot wire in a bundle, but I have actually touched a 12-2 wire in sheath that I KNOW is hot and on one side of the cable it beeps, the other..nothing...That level of proximity is bit too much in the case of a non-contact voltage tester which is usually something you use as a quick double check that something is certainly off...I bought this to replace an older unit that would glow red anytime it was within an inch of something hot...for finding a specific hot wire, it does great...general checking of an outlet, switch, or cable bundle..I do not trust it."
5,Fluke is great!,I have used this tester for years and it is a wonderful tool to have when doing any electrical work. Turn it on and you know if you have power. Finding the power lead out of a bunch of connected black wires is simple! A great tool that saves you time every time!
4,Nice safety tool for the DIY people,"I had to troubleshoot an electric baseboard heater, in a new house I just moved into. Of course the breaker box isn't labeled correctly due to upgrades over the last 30 years, so I had no idea which breaker to use. I also ordered a clamp meter, but it's jaws were too big to get into the space where the wiring came into the heater. I used the voltage tester to assist with finding the correct breaker (constant red, go flip a breaker, no constant red, bingo, found it) and verify when the thing had power restored to it. Turned out to be a broken thermostat connection, and the heater was fine, and all is repaired safely (and the circuit breaker is now properly labeled."
1,fluke is having problems,"sometimes does not detect 110 - 120v in lines, it's a shame i like the design of the device"
2,Fluke ... made in China,"I purchased this voltage detector thinking that for $25 I'd get a nice, solid, US-made product. Upon receiving it, I set up to test known circuits. I found the following problems:1) it is too sensitive in some instances - like near a plastic surge protector2) it is not sensitive enough in other instances - in outlets where the tip cannot go in fully3) it is erratic when touching the metal base of lamps (I tried two) - it indicates dangerous voltage when I know for sure that this is not the case. Granted, I might have received a defective one.I will return it today."
5,Excellent Tool,"Fine quality tool typical of Fluke.The switch on this tester is much better than that found on the Greenlee tester. I am often working in cramped, dark areas and require a solidly built tester that doesn't suffer from inadvertent switch movement-a problem with the Greenlee and similar devices.This tester, like every other non-contact (NC) tester I have used, will occasionally provide a ""false positive"" indication. This is often caused by an errant voltage present on a cable which is laying near an energized cable. This is due to inductance is is probably unavoidable with a NC device.This is one of the best tool investments you can make-absolutely essential for electrical, plumbing, remodeling, or demolition. Work safely; always test it on an energized conductor and verify proper operation before use on unknown cables.Highly recommended!"
3,not perfect as expected,"There is one flaw that from time to time it doesn't work suddenly. After I shake it hard or beat it against something, it functions again. So there is a problem in electrical connection."
5,Great Device,"If you ever had a light bulb break and were not sure the power is off, this device will tell you. It makes a nice addition to a tool kit for household electrical work."
5,Handyman needing a non-grounded voltage tester,Works far better than my previous tester. I would highly recommend it for electrical testing.
5,Does the job,I used this to check for live wiring when doing an installation. No issues with the device. Construction is good and not heavy to carry in your pocket.
4,Voltage Tester,Works as advertised. I tried to replace battery but had a tough time trying to open the unit to install a new battery.
4,electrical safety,"a must have for all employees who work near or with electrical circuits. very effective, accurate and it gets me home"
5,HELPED ME A LOT,LET ME KNOW WHAT WIRES HAD CURRENT WITHOUT TOUCHING OR TAKING THE OUTLET APART.....GREAT FOR THE NOVICE.........I FINISHED WHAT I HAD TO SAY BUT COULDNT SUBMIT MY COMMENTS BECAUSE OF NOT ENOUGH WORDS AND NOW YOU HAVE TO READ THIS FOR NOTHING .... NOW I HAVE ENOUGH ENGLISH WORDS..... GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER AMAZON.
5,AWSOME FIGUER.,THIS FIGUER LOOKS JUST LIKE THE BIG RED MONSTER KANE. AND THE HEAD SCAN IS GOOD TO. THIS IS A WWE FANS MUST HAVE.
5,Excellent quality and service!,This is a great cap. I bought it for my veteran father and he's worn it everyday since he received it. The cap is great quality and the service was great also. I highly recommend it for any air force veterans!!
5,Great review of America's mistakes and underestimations.,"I won't do a whole review...see the many listed. However, I will state this a factual book and will be scary to any cogent person."
3,Chocolate Milk,Although this is quite tasty it strikes me as nothing more than chocolate milk with a very minute hint of coffee. Even thought it wasn't quite what I was looking for it's still quite good and I do recommend it.
5,Fabulous series!,"We are huge fans of Dan Frontier, a composite of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett. Each story--full of adventure!!!-- progresses in length, difficulty, vocabulary etc. Dan Frontier Goes Hunting is book 2 or 3 in the series."
5,Written in gut-wrenching descriptive language,"Set in the time of imprisoned gangsters such as Al Capone, Alcatraz Island: Memoirs Of A Rock Doc is the personal story of Milton Daniel Beacher, a physician who cared for the prison population of Alcatraz Island for one year. Deftly edited by Dianne Beacher Perfit, Alcatraz Island is a candid and revealing journal of brutal living conditions, a prisoner's strike, a successful escape, suicides, and much more. A vivid, gripping book, written in gut-wrenching descriptive language that brings the forbidding rock to life, Alcatraz Island is highly recommended reading for students of American penology as well as a riveting autobiography of life behind bars from the unique perspective of a prison doctor."
5,Very Informative and Descriptive,"This is a very vivid account of the actions surrounding and leading up to the sinking of the Lusitania by one of Germany's U-Boat fleet during WW I. Ms Preston does an excellent job at the end of the book dismissing certain theories and even creating a few of her own without being too overly biased. This is an excellent historical account of that tragic day, which unfortunately, gets overshadowed by the sinking of the Titanic and would definitely recommend it."
1,Long and boring,The book's thrilling part is roughly written in 100 pages the rest of the book is worthless and boring. The sub's first story -when they got trapped- is almost but not quite thrilling but when you read the end of that story you'll be disappointed for your time wasted. I can write more examples but then this will be a spoiler. So yes this book is long-winded boring.
2,A Major Movie in Mind?,"Disappointed. Bought this believing it to be a history book (with new revelations) to add to my others. Alas, this distracted Oxford-educated-historian-come-broadcaster may have her periscope trained on Hollywood and a lucrative follow up to Titanic. Nothing new here, but to be fair, I couldn't put it down once under way....It was as if I were watching a movie, and deciding which stars would play what parts. Fisher, Churchill, Vanderbilt and Turner...hmm? Not forgetting Lady Allan and a whole host of bit parts. I look forward to watching it sometime in the near future."
2,Disappointing,"Diana Preston's new Lusitania book smacks of soap opera! Are we really to believe that survivors had limbs amputated on the decks of rescue trawlers and without anasthetic? Come on! Fishermen gutting fish is one thing, amputations are quite another! Her play on the sympathy vote is quite extraordinary. Images kept her awake at night? Poor thing! Try hot milk, dear! (Or counting the money). I'm sorry, but I think the journalist in her won over the historian! The only thing keeping her book afloat is the sheer willpower of her publisher's promotional machine. Without that, her book would join the Lusitania on the bottom. Which incidentally, is where it belongs!"
1,Row away from this one as fast as you can!!!,"This book is a prime example of why maritime subjects should be written about by maritime historians.ERRORS! ERRORS! ERRORS! ERRORS! So, so many errors. If you want to get a distorted, sensationalized version of the Titanic, watch the Cameron film. If you want to get a distorted, sensationalized version of the Lusitania, READ THIS piece of ....The best part of this book is the title--An Epic Tragedy. Believe me, that's the best three-word description of Preston's big screw-up.(Note to publisher--if you want to publish inaccurate garbage, I can dig out a few of my old junior high reports that are apparently worthy of being circulated. I could use the $$$)"
4,"Fun, simple, and cheap","Classically obnoxious Happy Bunny for under $10 - what's not to like? The colors are surprisingly vibrant, and despite being in sunlight constantly and having my passengers grind their sneakers into them, my mats look good after two months. As another reviewer stated, they can (and DO) slip since they're light; however, my car is built in a way where they can't end up under the front seats, so occasional movement doesn't bother me. Note that if you have a large car you may find these too small for the front. For compact and midsize cars I think they're fine."
3,Eats batteries,"This is is nice quality saw that works well, but has one drawback. It eats batteries very quickly. And when the battery even starts to get low it completely looses all torque power. The only way to work with this saw is to have at least 3 batteries available and charged before starting work. But it will cut like a workhorse as long as you feed it batteries."
4,"Good book, though I liked ""Rain"" better.","I must admit that I was a little disappointed by this book. ""Rain"" was so good, that perhaps I had unfair expectaions of this book. Still, ""The Keepsake"" is worth reading, and I think I might like it better once I get around to re-reading it.Kirsty Gunn has become my favorite author, and I look forward to her next book"
2,Worthless,This book is really worthless. Waste of money. Only got it because it was a requirment for the class. Really didnt use it in class though.
1,Poor Quality,"I had purchased three of these splitters for my home and immediately installed two of them, thinking that they were upgrades from my old 1-1000 megahertz splitters. After a few hours, I noticed a distortion in my digital TV so I removed one of the splitters and went back to my original splitters, which solved the problem immediately. I thought that I made have picked up a bad splitter and left the other splittler in place.A week later, I noticed that digital TV (and internet this time) was not working again so I replaced the remaining zenith splitter with an old splitter and guess what? Everything started to work again. The Zenith digital splitters are very poor quality.DO NOT BUY."
4,A Good Read!,"Let's get one thing out of the way: This is not a book about how to conduct last-minute meetings. It is a book about organizing conferences, conventions and other off-site gatherings that involve extensive planning - and preferably not at the last minute. That said, it's a useful book. Fern Dickey provides exactly the kinds of hands-on details that a virgin conference organizer would need, from online resources to relevant organizations, contact information, and sample charts that you can use for record keeping, budgeting and planning. There's nothing groundbreaking here, and there are no secret tactics revealed. Instead, Dickey has produced a thorough working reference that we [...] recommend to anyone new to the dizzying world of conference planning."
1,"Already sent a review, here's another one.","I received the wrong book and have never received the right one. There was no attempt to correct ""their"" mistake!"
2,No dictionary - removed from product,"The product was in good condition, but the dictionary was removed completely. That was a ""rip off."" Angry pun intended."
4,another favorite soundtrack,"this soundtrack is another good one from a tp movie. i like every track, but Keep your Head Up by Chaka Kahn is my favorite track."
3,Great Movie,I loved the movie but was not so impressed with the soundtrak. I did like most of the songs however.
4,The Song by Kem and Marissa Rose!!!!,I am absolutely in love with the song by Kem and Marissa Rose. I'd first heard the song on the radio a couple of days ago but they didn't list the female that was singing along with KEM nor is it listed on the outside of the CD but...thank God I found it. I love her voice and I think she helps to make it one of the better songs on the CD.
4,This is a great soundtrack,"This is a great soundtrack. I love how they mixed the old with the new showcasing such classic's as Al Green's ""Love and Happiness"" and the O'Jay standard played at every African-American Family Reunion, ""Family Reunion"". The 2 highlights from the cd representing the new are the song by Johhny Gill (The Wedding Song) that will surly be played at every wedding that I attend this year and the sexy duet by Kem and Marissa Rose (Tonight), her soulful and sexy vocals can't be beat. I've been trying to find a cd that just features Marissa Rose. Can anyone help me out? I love this cd and I'm sure you will too."
4,Madea's Family Reunion Soundtrack,"I was upset to not be able to find any information on Philipa Williams. I love the song ""Look in the mirror"" and was sorry that it was not on the soundtrack. Although the soundtrack was nice I was left hanging looking for more. Where can I find this song??????????????????"
3,Predictable but good,"His artwork is good. It is helpful in learning techniques to eventually graduate in doing your own work by just looking a scene or picture. All of his books are great, predictable, but great."
2,Not what I expected,This seemed more like a home video than professionally done. The camera work was shaky at times. Perhaps I had too high expectations.
5,Joy's review on Dora,This is a wonderful video for my grandaughter. She likes the interaction this video offers and likes to answer the questions when Dora asks for help. It also offers Spanish words for her to learn. What a great learning tool. The characters are adorable.
3,It was kind of lame,It was kind of lame but my kids like it so that's all that counts. I found it boring but then again I don't like Dora.
1,"THIS BOOK ASSISTED MY SON""S SUICIDE!","Some may believe the right to choose to die is each person's right. My 26 year old son bought this book and used the information in it to commit suicide. He left it at his bedside beside his body. No one can understand the depth of pain this has caused. If you are considering buying this book for this reason. Stop! Your family and friends will be absolutely devastated by the pain of grieving. Seek others to help you. This is not the answer. Suicide because you are depressed is a permanent response to a temporary problem..Please talk to others, share your feelings and concerns. You can make a different choice to ease your pain. The grieving mother of a beautifully hansome, intelligent, creative, now deceased son."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"As expected, Final Exit is both practical and dark, but enough with the plastic bags etc. With today's living wills and many MD's who know how to ""overdose"" a terminal patient, plus the lessons learned from the hospice field, this book is a little dated, and a little severe..JW"
1,My sister used this book,"When I was going through my sister's things, I came across this book. I read through parts of the book and she clearly planned her suicide with this book's advice. This is the most irresponsible book I have ever come across. My sister was not dying; she had MS and could and would have lived a long life in spite of her diagnosis. I usually give away books I am done with. I burned this one. My sister was 44. She left behind heartbroken parents, children, and siblings. Too bad this book didn't tell her how devastated those who loved her would be due to her actions."
3,It helped my mom find the strength to pull the trigger,"Final Exit gave my mother an excuse to leave behind four children and a loving husband. This book was on her bedside table when she pulled the trigger in her bedroom. I guess Mr. Humphrey's desired result was achieved, but it's hard to impress an 11-year-old with such praise for an eloquently written book when explaining that she got the strength to leave him behind after it came into her possession."
1,This Book Is Sad,"I found this book at the Saint Vincent De Paul store in my town. I read parts of it while I was at the store and I was shocked! I turned it in to the stores clerk and told her that the book tells people how to commit suicide and she had the book taken off the shelf. I am a mental health advocate. I work on an advisory board. I suffer from Bipolar disorder and Borderline Personality disorder. Yes, I've had many suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide. But I find alternatives to taking my life. For one, I tried Alpha Stim. And it worked. Recently I got depressed again and tried jump roping and it works. Jump roping worked so well that I quit smoking. If I would of found this book before I found my copping skills, then I would be dead today and alot of good would of been lost. I believe that I make the world a better place for others even though I suffer and have to find what works to ease the suffering. The guy who wrote this book should be arrested."
2,Good information but will not cause suicide,"I found the book has good information, but I know it would not be a determining factor with someone to commit suicide. There are many more websites out there that were far darker then any of the information found in this book."
5,A necessary book,Candidly discussed and well presented in ways that addresses the issue of dignified death and dying from a great variety of perspectives. A great guide and support for when the time comes to consider very intense and often difficult decisions.
3,Final Exit,"Since this book is not easily accessible, I am pleased that Amazon makes it available. It is not specific enough to make the contents of great value in this country of restricted liberties. it is sheer stupidity to sentence those whose only purpose in life is waiting for death with further roadblocks. The aged and infirm who have people who cherish them, I suspect are very rare. Medical doctors are insensitive and uninformed and quite ignorant of this field. In my area we do not even have one geriontologists. Final Exit is a start but only a start. We sentence the very old to exploitation, suffering and indignities. Meanwhile feeling self righteous but relieved when those inconvenient old people finally die."
1,National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255,"If you are suicidal, and looking for a sign, here it is: PLEASE DON'T KILL YOURSELF.You are suicidal because of a chemical imbalance which can be treated just as Diabetes or Anemia can be treated.You feel suicidal because you have no hope left. But, life IS hope. Hope is still with you, right this moment. Right now, you are alive, and part of this crazy, mixed up world! THAT is hope. Grab onto it, sink your teeth and claws into it, and don't you dare let go!National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255[...]I gave it one star because I think more people might check these ratings. I don't know. I believe terminally ill people should have control over their own death. I also believe that all of the people who committed suicide using methods from this book, would STILL have died, but just using another, probably more painful and ghastly method."
3,A Suicide How To Book.,"The book is basically, how to commit suicide in so many ways. It does not shed any light on alternernate solutions."
4,Do it right the first time...,Whats to say about this book? It has good info on how to kill yourself or assit a friend. It is a good book well writen and if you follow it's advice you should be dead in no time at all...
2,Book Review of Final Exit,I was intrigued to read this book because of my work in the mental health field. It helped me understand what ways are fatal. This is not a book I would normally read or recommend to my friends.
2,Disappointment,"Not really the seller's fault, this book was a different edition than I'd sought and did not contain the information I wanted. Also, due to other event's, I found that - much as I may admired the efforts of the author in the past - he is now and arrogant man shirks responsibility for his organization and actions."
5,Very useful information,Great to have resources available without governement interference. Remember to use this information with care and follow the guideline that are outllined.
4,Routes to freedom and dignity,"For one who has just watched his father die a miserable and lonely death in a nursing home and who is watching his mother die slowly the same way, this book gives me some hope that my child will not have to experience the same torture. The book is concise, factual, and to the point. It is informative, but does not try to persuade one way or the other. Humphry discusses dozens of methods of suicide and recommends the ones he thinks are best, and why they are. His book is a great help."
1,Simply NOT helpful,Lacking practical solutions. Perhaps I was shipped an older edition. The copy I received was not worth the time spent reading.
4,Good book,Good to hear how the ordinary methods of committing suicide usually screw up. Seems as though helium is the best method but it is not mentioned in this book.
4,The Final Exit,I have a chronic illness which is getting worse. I wanted to know my options for the future. This was helpful to me.
5,Controversial but important,"I found this very well written and thought out. It is a difficult subject to think/read about, though I must say, if a family member of mine were suffering and I knew they wanted 'out' of this earthly suffering, I would go to all lengths to help them. I do not consider living a long life and ending it in utter pain and helplessness and feeling demeaned anything that is a dignifying end to a person's life. Actually anyone suffering with no hope in sight is deserving of these thoughts and options. Excellent book. A+."
1,Grossly Misleading Label,"According to the label, the consumer is led to believe that each capsule contains 625 mg of magnesium. In actuality, you have to take 6 capsules to get that amount!Total rip-off...do not buy this item!"
2,Misleading packaging,"The front of the bottle says 625 mg, 200 capsules. It is not until you get the bottle and see the fineprint that you find out that there are 6 pills to a serving size. Very misleading."
5,Super Product,My doctor was specific in guiding to me the correct source of magnesium. This is a great product and I noticed a significant difference within a week. Super fast shipping as well.
2,Advertised that it is eligible for the $25 supersaver,It says it qualifies for the supersaver discount but when combining with other supersaver items or even doubling up on the item there is no supersaver discount in the final order.
1,This product is <25% carvacrol,"My rating is based on the misinformation on Amazon's page for this item, not efficacy of the product. It states that the product is standardized to 70% carvacrol oil. This is false.Per serving as labeled on bottle: 70 mg olive oil, 37.6 oil of oregano yielding ~26.3 mg carvacrolAn individual ingredient is 70% carvacrol but it is then diluted such that the final product is 24.4%Planetary herbals website lists the actual quantities but Amazon does not. Shame on AmazonDo not be duped like I was"
3,The product is good for it's price,"This is a very nice, healthy product at a reasonable price. However, I found that I got much better results with a different brand that is a bit higher in price. I have severe exzema and the other brand works faster and smells better.Planetary Herbals was very prompt with delivery and I would not hesitate to purchase other products from them."
1,Deceptive,This product is a very substandard or a dilute version of Oil of Oregano that is produced by North American Herb. It had a foul taste and did not eliminate my sore throat as the more expensive North American Herb product did. This is about half the price of the North American brand. But you get what you pay for. I ended up throwing out the entire bottle other than the few drops I tried.
2,crappy disco,"to be honest, I used to like this disco band in the early 80's when I was in the primary school. But later I realized that the band has ripped of or fooled the most people around them with their play back singin-strategy.....the same case like Milly Vanilie did in 1996. I have changed my mind and gave the cd 2 stars."
4,Great Purchase,I live in a funky attic space that has a lot of character and charm but comes with a lot of angles and a regualr couch wouldn't work but this chaise is perfect. I've decorated with colorful down pillow and a throw and it looks great. This piece has a very firm thick mattress where the other outdoor chaises didn't. If the back of this one reclined it would have received 5 stars!
5,Outdoor Sectional,"I bought a complete eight peace sectional seating for my patio. This furniture is everything I was wanting, low cost, good quality and good style. The cushions are very nice and comfortable. The parts are some what time consuming to assemble, but it's not bad. I would recommend a ratchet alien wrench not the provided alien wrench; it will kill your fingers. I would recommend this sectional seating to anyone. I just now need to get some nice pillows for it and it will be complete. 100 % HAPPY"
1,THIS CHAISE DOES NOT RECLINE! WOODWORKING REQUIRED!,"I thought I would get lucky and get one that fit together, but it was not to be. I got almost completely done with the assembly, but then, trying to fit the last piece, the hole was 1/4"" too far away from the slat that had to go into it. I don't want to screw it up, so I will need to buy a router bit for my drill and try to shave the right amount off. I am not sure how this will affect the way the bolts go in though.Also, despite this comment in Amazon's description--""The chair offers a gently angled seat back on which to recline.""--this chaise DOES NOT RECLINE! So it's pretty useless for lying in the sun to get a tan, which is why I bought it for my wife. She's disappointed, I have an unassembled chair on my floor, and I have a woodworking project tomorrow.I'm too lazy to take it back apart, box it up, and ship it back, or I would do that.I won't buy furniture from Amazon again.Loyd"
2,non-skid rubber ring fails,"While is was attracted to the stainless steel construction (I have foster dogs that occasionally are chewers). My disappointment comes from the rubber ring. It does not stand up very well, especially given the constant washing it went thru. I bought about 6 of these and the ring on 5 broke off.Perhaps others who would use the product in a less rigorous environment would be satisfied."
3,it ain't all that,"For the amount paid, over half a hundy, I expected a better cut from this. It's being used in a relatively cheap Delta miter saw, so maybe I'm expecting too much, but I don't think so.The wood still splinters at the bottom rear of the cut. Not as badly as the oem blade, but I was hoping, and I think reasonably, that this blade would virtually eliminate this.So now I have another 'beater' blade, only this one cost mucho dinero. NO JOY!"
3,Unneeded filter,"I bought this filter for a new Sony DSC-H9 Camera. Becouse of the design of the camera the filter can only be used IF you attach the adaptor ring (a large conical hood-like attachment). This makes the camera quite bulky, difficult to stow in a bag, and the camera lens cap can no longer fit when the filter is attached."
5,74 mm lens protector,Excellent for protecting your lens. A very good value. Prompt service.What more could you ask for?
2,I can't recommend this book,"This quite slim book provides a far from complete coverage of 1... g6. It's not quite clear to which audience this book is attributed. For advanced chess players the coverage of the various variations is certainly not thorough enough, while for beginners and intermediates the ideas and strategies behind this difficult opening are not outlined sufficiently. The book may be of use as a starting point for building a repertoire based on 1... g6, but a lot of own work will have to be done."
2,The Fisherman's Quilt,"I met Margaret Doyle at a quilt shop in Tigard, Oregon. She assured me that this book would be a good book to share with the ladies at my church. She even offered me questions to help with study/discussion. Well, I read only to page 13 and encountered once God's name used in vain and on page 13 the ""F"" word was used. I am first of all disappointed with Margaret telling me that this would be a good book for believers in God/Jesus Christ and second using foul language, even though that is the way they talk in real life. The language is what left me no other choice than to burn this book. Please while writting good English literature please use good English. Janice Eacker"
2,I agree. Save your money.,The online Sun tutorials do a much better job of explaining the fundamentals of RMI.This book also offers only a superficial (and incoherent)explanation of the internals of RMI. Too much time is spent discussing the design patterns of the contrived examples.One of the most glaring omissions is a class diagram showing the members of the RMI packages and a discussion of their relationships. The component diagrams are insufficient for a book promising the reader mastery of RMI.
2,Save your money - not recommended,"I just got this book and wasted [price]. I only has 142 pages on RMI and the remainder is rehashed code to build a chat application, EJB example, etc. He spends more time on describing his designs than on RMI.I finished the book the first day I got it. Although, I skipped the long summaries after every chapter. If you subtract the 31 pages of introduction to client/server architecture, the redundant ""tips"" and, the summaries this ""book"" will come in under 100 pages.The few interesting points he makes, he refers later chapters for the details and some of his descriptions are so convoluted that I had to go back to my own code to make sure that I knew what was happening. This is not a book for beginners. You should only read it if you fully understand RMI and then why buy. There are better descriptions of RMI on the web."
1,Amateurish and badly edited,"I agree with all the negative reviews already posted, but I was so frustrated with this book I had to add another voice of criticism.The book was obviously a manuscript dump with no editing that I could detect. Why Wiley thinks they can charge this amount for no work at all is beyond me. It is littered with grammatical errors, incomprehensible sentences, and annoying repetition. In short, it is nearly unreadable. To add insult to injury, there are countless summaries which condescend to tell the reader that she should now have a good understanding of the covered material, and can move on. Don't be so sure you will have a good understanding. I did not, and I've been using RMI for some time.As others have stated, the examples are contrived, and not very well written. There is very little here of use for those developing large-scale distributed systems.Save your money (considerable money, in this case) and stick to Sun's website."
3,"A good tutorial for RMI, but...","I purchased this book after doing some research into RMI via the internet to give me a more solid understanding of RMI, which it did. However, when applying my acquired knowledge to a real-world application, I found that I was missing a HUGE piece of the RMI puzzle. RMI over the INTRAnet is a wonderful thing; however, when trying to implmenent RMI over the INTERnet, and the RMI server is behind a firewall, you are in for a painful migraine. This is a show-stopper for my employers, I wish that the book mentioned something about RMI and firewalls. There are workarounds for the firewall, but they are by no means easy and you will not find them in this book."
2,Mastering RMI,"I bought this book for Rickard Oberg's reputation, which cost me [amount]. When I completed reading the book, I hardly believe the author is Richard Oberg. Most of books I read about RMI are better written than this book. The chapters about EJB and JINI are even worse. All the book is about the introduction of RMI and EJB and JINI...."
2,Disappointment,"Just got this reel today from Amazon for trout fishing, and I will be returning it tomorrow. First, the bail is very tough to close automatically. It takes a lot of strength to close it with the handle, and it feels like I am going to break it. I own 22 reels, and this is the toughest one to close. Second, there is a lot of wobble to the handle on the retrieve. Also, no matter how much you tighten it, it will come loose again. I own 6 Mitchell reels and this doesn't even come close to the quality that they can produce."
2,"facts, not altogether correct","At first I thought this book would have much to say about North Carolina history in the time period I have researched myself for many years, but as I read the book I realized that there were some errors, ommissions and some things mentioned that made little or no sense in context of what was being stated at the time. So I re-read the entire book, made notations and started researching to get answers. While there is quite a bit of history in this book, I would not use this edition as a study or source."
2,None of his biggest hits,"Mostly second tier stuff and unreleased takes, this is a disappointing compilation. Rumble? Nope. Ace of Spades? Not here. Jack the Ripper? Forget it. Don't buy this unless you already have his greatest hits and just want some back up."
4,Decent energy saving light.,"Fits the bill. Was looking for something bright and energy saving. Stumbled upon this LED replacement for the old incandescent bulb nightlights. The dimming feature works fairly well but I've kept the brightness to the max. All the colors are vivid and bright except for red. Not crazy about the star etching on this model but I was more interested in trying out the dimmable feature, only to realize that it was a useless feature -- at any other setting, it's just not enough lighting to walk around safely.I prefer the standard model by Megabrite - no frills unlike this one. Bought that one as well.Megabrite LED Color Changing Night Light with Photo Sensor"
5,Great Nightlight for Nursery,"I bought this product to use as a nightlight in my son's nursery. This is the first nightlight that I can honestly say wasn't too bright or too dim. It's perfect! This light gives you the option of automatically rotating through the colors or selecting one constant color. All of the colors are very appealing, yet some are brighter than others. The sensor is great... I went through a ton of bulbs with my other nightlights since it's easy to forget to unplug/turn off every morning before leaving for work. This one automatically comes on in the evening and goes off in the morning. It's great. Exacly what I was searching for."
5,Most amazing night light,This is the most amazing night light out there. I saw it at a friend's house while I was on vacation and loved it. When I got home I got right on the internet and found it and bought two of them. It puts off just the right amount of light and the colors are cool. Check it out for yourself.
2,"good, when it works","I bought 4 of these in October of 2007. One of them stopped working within a week of being used. The photo sensor no longer worked, meaning the light stayed on ALL the time. The fade/cycle feature also stopped working. Amazon exchanged my item for a working one. Now, March 2009, another one has stopped working and is displaying the exact same symptoms. The light is decent when it works, but as someone pointed out, it's really not all that bright."
4,Great lille book.......Loaded with useful information.,I loved this little itty bitty book. It is Erotically charged and lavishly illustrated. It's well written and in a tasteful manner. This great and informative love making manual makes a great intimate gift for that special someone. My boyfriend gave it me and reading it was like an electrical charge. I couldn't wait for him to come home. It's a small book loaded with information that can be very useful for women who want to rock someone world. I loved it and I'm planning on buying a few for christmas to pass along to my girlfriends.
3,Ear Catching Melodies Italian Girls Like,"I'm not an Italian girl, but this music is very soothing and calming. Reminds me of the 'James Bond' type music from the '60's. If you like this kind of stuff, you'll like this album."
1,Fact Errors vs. spelling Errors,"Quite frankly I wish I had read the many other reviews before I invested in this book. The author makes much of correcting Clark's spelling errors, but his own errors reveal he did not go much beyond the spelling. Especially egregious is the one where he tells us that we cannot know from the jouurnals how many canoes were made by Lewis and Clark at the top of Great Falls. The number is given explicitly in the journal entries for three days: July 9, 10, and 14. Because of this I will try to find other books about Burr, wilkinson and Pike."
4,Chasing the facts,"This is a laugh-aloud book at times. Our author is at times a funny fellow, clearly a revisionist historian, and unfortunately an omitter of details and scholarly references. Yet, in all, I could not put the book down. It's really quite droll, if you do not mind the occasional scatological jarring.But beware....our author is loose on facts. Most obvious example is in his lengthy misidentification of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase as ""Salmon P. Chase."" Samuel Chase was tried by Congress during Jefferson's administration. However, Salmon Chase was born much later than Samuel and served on Presidnet Lincoln's cabinet and later was a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court."
2,"Not well edited, so is it truthfully written?","The basic story is intriguing and very gripping, but is it the truth? The book could have been wonderful, but is seriously flawed. Snippets of tales appear haphazardly, making the reading of it less flowing - and on two instances the facts were contrary to basic knowledge of any 6th grade student in history:1.) Andrew Jackson was not destined to be President in 1820. (He took office in 1829, I recall without looking it up.)2.) Thomas Jefferson was not the 2nd President. (What ever happened to John Adams?)When these obvious errors appeared, I thought perhaps the rest of the book was junk too, so why bother reading this."
2,"Interesting and, yes, slapdash","For readers who have a passing knowledge of Lewis and Clark, Aaron Burr and even Zebulon Pike, this book provides interesting insight into American political life prior to the War of 1812. The ironic, speculative style will also be appealing to many. In this regard, the conclusion, a succinct muse on the significance of these actors in American history, is provocative.Here's the problem: even a nonspecialist reader like myself recognizes errors. I read the 2000 paperback edition and noted these mistakes: a reference to Burr's duel with ""Madison"" (pg. 216); a reference to Andrew Jackson's election in ""1820"", not 1828 (pg. 250); and mention of one of Burr's court hearings in Tennessee when they actually occurred in other states (pg. 280). This type of carelessness is disconcerting."
2,"Entertaining reading, if slapdash at times","Mr. Montgomery's book is a compulsively readable account of the exploration of the Great West, chronicling the triumphs and foibles of Lewis and Clark, contrasted with the incompetent bumblings of Zebulon Pike. Montgomery also explores Aaron Burr's treasonous attempts to detach a portion of the Louisiana purchase and/or Mexico for his own private fiefdom. I won't rehash the numerous and embarassing factual errors in the work, but would partly exonerate the author by noting that they are likely the product of haste and sloppiness, and would have been culled out by a better editor. Montgomery makes no pretension at serious history, but spins a good, journalistic yarn, casting light into an obscure corner of US history. His grasp of character seems particularly sharp."
2,Disappointing and Typical,"I found this book very inconsistent and overall disappointing. Some of the more obvious advice was good (look your best, get out more, be willing to take a chance), but it was basically common sense advice not worth buying a book for. The advice about sex for women was awful, basically taking the attitude that you're lucky if you get any so don't ""withhold sex"" on the first date. The advice that you ""may"" want to use a condom really lost me. Just because someone is in their 40's or 50's doesn't mean they're immune to the STD epidemic and should risk their sexual health. They put in 'do what is right for you disclaimers but the underlying message is a desperate one. I hated this book and wouldn't recommend it."
2,it is plagiarized,The original was written by an intelligent and savvy person! These people are scurrilous pedants! You should be embarrassed.A curse on this book...
2,Fine as beach reading,"This book has a predictable plot and one dimensional characters presented in lite cuisine prose. Fine for the beach or a rainy afternoon. A book that you will enjoy, but not mind leaving behind in the summer house for next year's renters."
2,There's a good book in here somewhere,"A third of this book is amusing, fun, and about interesting characters. The rest is filled with boring stereotypes and cliches that finally made it unreadable. Every gay man is not sex-obsessed, cruising the dunes, and explaining to dumb straights the intricacies of glory holes and back rooms. I've nothing against a good dollop of sex but this book is over the top. Save your money and read Joe Keenan, Stephen McCauley and Jim Grimsley."
3,"Light, entertaining, perfect-for-summertime read","I recently read this book as part of a gay book club, & while it certainly isn't deep or provocative, it is entertaining. The characters are somewhat stereotypical, but are still interesting. The plot is somewhat predictable, but I will credit the author for resisting the temptation to wrap everything up in a neat package at the book's end. Pat resolutions are avoided. Also, I appreciated the author's, or proofreader's, attentiveness to spelling & correct grammar - something woefully lacking in too much of today's fiction. As I entitled this review, this book is appropriate for light, entertaining, summertime reading."
2,Gay Real Estate,"This is only summer reading, and it is fine when one takes it for only that. Any more serious reading, for the meaning searcher, will stumble unto the unlikely premise of a few gay developers that end up transforming within a year a restful and forgotten Rhode Island resort. Yeah, forgotten, sure..... The characters described tend to be a little bit stereotyped, and the plot turns way too much around real estate, including the aging queen buying a little palace with private harbor. The coming out/coming of age subplot starts well, but ends up predictable of course. More interesting is the old antique dealer closeted queen transformation, which by itself and with more development could be the seed of a nice book. But as I said before, if what you have in mind is a book to take to the beach, or to the country home of your friends upstate, for the week end, then you might get a few smiles out of it."
4,Millions By: Frank Cottrell Boyce,This book is about 2 brothers who find alot of cash. They want to spend it before anyone knows they have it.I would read this book because I would like to know how the found the money and how they planned on spending it all. i know how I would spend it if I found it. I would help my family first and then I would buy myself a new tractor.
3,It cheats,"This game is better then fifa 2002 but it is not much better. When you play on professional difficulty it cheats!Every single time you get the ball you turn right into the player.Also when you try and shoot the ball their keeper always stops it and when they shoot your keeper never stops it.I have the best team and I can't win a game.I always get the first goal but then they come back to win it 3-1. Some of the players I have on my team are David Beckham, Roberto Carlos,Oliver Kahn,Patrick Vieri,and Ryan Giggs.Even with those players I can ever hardly win a game.The thing that bothers me is it is impossible to defend and score corner kicks.Every single time I press the right buttons to head the ball out my guy always get shoved and you can never head it into the goal.Also when you are playing defense you can't shoulder charge at all.One time I had 3 guys shoulder charge 1 person and that person still got past.You know just thinking about I think fifa 2002 is better."
3,fifa 2003,this has great graphics excellent realism the commentry is great an the player animations are brilliant
1,Crap,"The software won't install with newer computers (P4-3GHZ, ati radeon 9800 pro, 1GB ram, audigy2 zs). Don't buy this software."
2,Worst game of the EA Sports Fifa series,"This is the worst game of the Fifa series.If i remember well they dont even have the national team of Holland,they dont have the dutch league,or Portuguese,yeah,and i think they dont have the national team Portugal.And how can they rate Anderlecht as strong as Man Utd(am a fanatic man utd fan),Real Madrid,Juventus or Milan?And its too easy.And you cant even create players like the other fifa games of EA Sports.It has nothing.What can i do know that i want to create Cristiano Ronaldo that they dont have it?I hope the next years Fifa will be a lot better.It only gets two insteaf of one stars becauce of the graphics.And they still have Sheringham on the England national team."
3,Very limited,"Ok... the gameplay is great, no doubt about that but without the addition of being able to make adjustments to the player rankings or even to create players, the longevity of playing beyond a season or two simply isnt there. As an American, I prefer to play the MLS league and a major drawback is that the players are all fairly equal, from rookie to star. For instance everyone on my Metrostars has kicking ability of either a 7 or an 8. Very disapointing."
4,pro evolution soccer rocks fifa,after playing this game i am definitely going back to ISS... good improvements tho... winning eleven 6 is still the best soccer game out there
1,Very Unimpressed,I am a constant buyer of the EA NHL franchise but found this game way too slow for my tastes.. I am not a soccer fan either so this may be affecting my judgment.
5,Just like Grandma's!,"I have been looking for a pizzelle maker for a long time. I didn't want the one that makes the small, thin pizzelles but one that made the bigger, thicker pizzelles my grandmother used to make. This is it! Pizzelles don't stick at all and I love that it is made in the US!"
5,Top of the Line Pizzelle Maker,"Not a whole lot to say except, if you want a top of the line pizzelle maker, then you should look no further. This little unit is pure quality, plus this family run company has been around a long time and do stand behind their product!"
1,WARNING! Do NOT Buy This Product,"The one and only positive comment I can make about purchasing the Palmer Pizzelle Iron is that it arrived in a matter of a couple of days. I opened the package to discover the outside casing had scratches all over it as well as some on the inside of the iron. I ordered and paid for a new product, but this product appeared to be used, possibly rebuilt. The construction of the iron was very shoddy and not worth the selling price of $72.99. The shipping cost to me was $13.50 and to return it to the seller cost me $15.50--a total shipping expense of $29.00. The seller was not willing to reimburse any of the shipping charges. Customer service rating an F. On the other hand, Amazon was extremely helpful and rates tops in customer service."
1,Beware buying from this manufacturer,"I purchased this item a week ago, and anxiously awaited delivery. Once it came, I immediately opened it, and made a batch using my favorite recipe. After about 6 Pizzelles, I knew this iron was not for me as it makes them way thicker than any other iron I have ever used. They are actually more like thin cakes which is not what I'm accustom to. I have since contacted Amazon regarding a return, and my message passed on to the company that actually shipped it. At that point I was told that they do not accept used products back (3 minutes worth), and if I do wish to return it, I have to pay a 25% restocking fee! Yes, 25% not the standard 10%. I never bash companies at all, but being one of the more expensive irons out there, I would expect more from a US based company! I will now contact Amazon regarding this since I do not see anything about that return policy on the site or would never of have ordered from them!"
3,pizzelle size,"The product looks like what I'm seeking, but no where does the information tell the size of the pizzelles. Are they 4 inch or 5 inch? My very, very old iron (manufactured in Pennsylvania in the 1960s) produced 5 inch pizzelles."
1,Noh Way,Got this and it is the sxact same thing as the stir fry... it says beef tomato pffft it tastes just like the stir fry mix ingredients are also the same get one or the other not both.
4,Wonderful Hidden Gem,"A lot of the tracks found on this LP are not on compilations and the songs are so good. This is the album I never had as a kid, and finally having it as an adult, I can see that she's got a gold voice on this, Greensleeves is perfect, Pony Ride is wonderful (the live in Japan version is WONDERFUL), and her version of Long and Winding Road just blows me away. I also find the backup singers to be delightful in contrast to her voice on It'll Be Me and Smile For me (awesome backup singers) And of course Jolene and Come on Over are also awesome tracks."
1,DANGEROUS ADVICE,"If you follow the advice in this book, such as sell your stocks whenever they drop more than 10%, you will become broke!!!Don't take my word for it. Many big-city newspapers and wire services have reported on how dangerous Mrs. Stav's advice really is.With the stock market now so volatile (prices rising and falling quickly), following her advice of selling so often is only gambling...and you will surely lose.To make matters worse, you will owe big taxes and stockbroker commissions by following this terrible advice. But, Mrs. Stav is a stockbroker so maybe her real goal is to get you to hand over your money for her to manage directly. Handing your money over to any stockbroker or financial planner is even more dangerous to your wealth.If you're looking to lose money, this book and Mrs. Stav's advice will help you lose it fast!"
1,Beware of Stockbrokers Looking For New Customers,"Very hard sell from a woman looking to make commissions from customers.The advice in this book is mediocre at best but her real goal is to confuse readers enough that they will call her and hire her as their broker.The money I paid for this book would have been better spent paying down my credit card debt. JULIE STAV IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL ""GET HER SHARE"" from this book."
1,Should have paid off credit card debt instead,"I stupidly followed the advice in this book and used the few extra dollars I had each month to buy stocks. What a mistake! I did exactly what Julie said to do and sold my stocks when they dropped by 10% in value. Between stockbroker commissions and taxes I am now $3,178 poorer than I was before I started. To make matters worse, these ""poor performing stocks"" jumped in price right after I sold them.Instead of buying stocks I should have paid off my credit card debt instead. Then I could have bought into some good mutual funds or better stocks.The advice in this book can cost you pleanty. I learned the hard way. If you want to buy a good stock-buying book choose the one by Peter Lynch called ""One Up On Wall Street."" Peter Lynch's advice is so good that Julie Stav repeats it and Peter Lynch's name over and over again. So buy the original book (by Peter Lynch) and not this book which is just a bad rip off of his advice."
1,Preying on the Fears of Latina Women,"Another self-serving book by another financial planner prowling for customers--but claiming that she is trying to help others. As a Latina woman I am ashamed that Miss Stav would be preying on the fears and financial problems of our own people. The advice isn't new or well written and it won't show you the way to financial freedom. ONLY THE AUTHOR WILL GET RICH FROM THIS BOOK!! Many better books are on the market that contain more useful advice for all women, such as ""Making the Most of Your Money"" by Jane Bryant Quinn and ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias."
2,Copy of Infomercial,I very much like Mr. Chumley's book and philosophy on weight loss. I thought the DVD would be an instructional companion to the book. I was wrong. It is a copy of his infomercial on his system. I feel I was misled.
5,Product is 100% positive,"I always research every product before purchase. I had a hard time deciding whether I should get an ergo or round body ball. I am so glad I bought the ergo shape. Even my 7 yr old grand daughter has a blast on it. It comes with a kit that my grand daughter actually used by herself to inflate the ball. She wouldn't even let me have a turn. I love the color, the texture, the quality, and the safety features. It also comes with a body ball workout CD. I am pleased with how easy and enjoyable it has been to add to my workouts. You can't beat the price. I added the jump rope (like suggested) and even got free shipping. I receive the package way faster than expected. I highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a good product and some fun!"
3,"Pretty avarage kung fu romp, nothing special here.","The best thing about this film is the main villain Ching Yi, with pointed boots and a stupid hat. Fighting is surprisingly weak, but gets better towards the end and the plot has a few interesting twists (though predictable.) Enjoyable film, but doesn't have to be seen more than once (ok, I've seen 3 times already...).For some really energetic fight action, get Sammo Hung's masterpiece Warriors Two (the best kung fu film ever), also from 1978 (which makes Eagle's Claw look very slow and very very old skool). But still. Maybe Lee Tso Nam's best film (definately over-rated here, it's far from 5-star quality, or even 4,) so see it if you have to (worth a rental.)"
4,Old Style Kung Fu,"If you like Shaw Brothers Style of movies this is a must have. Picture quality and audio are fair as typical of poor quality transfers, but tolerable. Fighting and movie are classic old style kung fu and make up for above."
3,"average fu at best, but a story that will really keep you interested","And certainly chang yi playing the white-haired villian is always great. Overall, a really good story.When the master is dying at this schol, he is going to name a successor to him. He does not pick the elder student(chi Kuan-chun), but a younger one(don wong). From here we get quite a few unexpected twists. And they are very well done.So no real great fighting, just some good old movie magic happening. I think this movie was missing dorian tan. He could have boosted it up to a 4, but the action just wasn't all that great."
4,Nice little classic kung fu diddy,"The film starts out interestingly enough. Several fighters go through their eagle claw sparring forms on some soundstage with a serious-sounding narrator describing the history of the forms. You know what I'm talking about. This always gets me excited that I'm in for a treat. I was not disappointed. In this Shaw Brothers-like tastey little kung fu diddy, the film relies heavily on the ""7 eagle claw styles"" and the secret 8th and 9th styles. Pretty nice classic kung fu storyline. The fighting is intriquing and satisfying. Having said that, this is not a great movie, but a nice, supremely watchable movie. As I think back to the days when I saw films like these in theatres in the 70s, this would probably be the ""second"" movie on the triple bill, not the ""marquee"" film, though not the ""third"" film either. Nice film to add to your classic collection."
3,"A pleasant set of songs, but not an instant hit.","Chantal Kreviazuk came up as similar to some of my favorite artists: Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, and Sheryl Crow. I listened to it when I got home from the store and wasn't really excited about it. I picked up the disc again three months later and listened to it and then I started to like the music. I have trouble picking my favorite songs on the album, but I like to listen to most of them."
5,I love this CD!!,"This is one of my all-time favorite CD's. I bought it on a whim before it became mainstream, and it was such a great investment. The lyrics are amazing, especially the lyrics to ""Green Apples,"" ""Imaginary Friend,"" and ""Surrounded."" I got an advance copy of ""Colour Moving and Still,"" and ""Under These Rocks and Stones"" is a far better album, although ""Colour"" is still excellent. BUY THIS CD, you won't regret it!! She is amazing."
5,Amazing...,"What a debut CD from this multi-talented Canadian singer-songwriter. Chantal has the gift to rock and yet thug at your heartstrings at the same time. Her songs are brilliantly written, often poignant, and always melodic. ""Surrounded"" and ""Wayne"" are probably two of the most powerful songs I have ever heard-especially on ""Wayne"" the emotion just keeps building and building-masterful production and delivery."" Imaginary Friend"" changes the pace to a slower,more reflective (yet still powerful), tone. You can easily see why this CD has firmly established Ms Kreviazuk as one of Canada's finest, if not slightly underrated, stars. She certainly has the vocal range and skills to have a long, healthy career-add the songwriting skills and you have a true superstar in the making...Bravo !"
4,Chantal review,"The shipping and the condition of the disc was perfect, it's the music itself that I found disappointing. But that's my own fault."
3,Good Talent,"I first heard the song ""Surrounded"" on Dawsons Creek a few years ago and finally decided to try the album. It's good talent but I'm not falling off my chair like the raves I've heard amongst everyone. There are a lot of talented singer/pianist/writers out there (Try Vanessa Carlton). It's good, though."
4,Nice,"Chantal reminds me of Tori Amos sometimes, in that both are excellent piano players (in a contest, I'd bet on Tori, though) and great singers. However, Chantal's music doesn't have enough of that special . . . 'something' . . . that Tori has. Still, Chantal's fascinating in interview (she loves the piano, the best instrument ever!) and the songs are great too!"
5,Totally identifiable,"I have had this cd for almost two years now and absolutely love it! She so innocently states and portrays so many feelings that i was able to completely ""feel"" what she was saying. This is definetely a must have!!"
4,You Have To See Her Live...,"I saw Chantal in 1997 when she was opening for Amanda Marshall. I was amazed by this woman's voice and talent. I bought Under These Rocks And Stones the next day and was a little disappointed. Her voice isn't as beautiful as it is live (same with her second release) and the album loses Chantal's energy and passion, but all in all this is a great album (better than her first, IMO). She reminds me of Tori Amos (in terms of piano skills) though without Tori's strange and just silly lyrics. My favorite songs are God Made Me, Surrounded, and Wayne. If you like Sarah McLachlan, the wonderful Natalie Merchant or any of those Lilith artists, you'll more than likely enjoy Chantal's music."
4,WOW...STOLE THE SHOW AT LILITH FAIR!!!,"August 16th...Molson Ampitheatre...Toronto... 6:45pm, and Chantal Kreviazuk takes the stage and starts her seven song performance with God Made Me!!! And she blew everyone away!!! Everyone at the Lilith Fair was amazed at her ability to perform live. She interacts with keen interest to the crowd whom was surprised by her strong, clear and powerful voice. The crowd also takes on to her rawness and innocence. She ended her performance at the Lilith with ""Leaving On A Jetplane"". All that I can say that is that Chantal is the next big star from Canada. The disc doesn't do any justice for what she can potentially do on a live cd. Considering that everyone at the Lilith were waiting for performances from Sarah, Natalie Merchant, and Paula Cole...Kreviazuk definitly was the most surprising artists and gave the best live performance!!! Whoo hoo...another great Canadian artist has made it big!!!"
4,Wonderful debut from a talented singer/songwriter,"This is a very well produced first album. Chantal has a great deal of ability to convey honest emotions; this talent is by-passed by a great deal of today's artists. Sometimes her voice penetrates a bit too deeply, but overall it's quite effective."
1,Not really 10ga!,"Thinking this was *not* one of the off-brand companies, I felt it would be safe to order this and actually get what was advertised. I have some speaker wire made by ""American Bass"". Now I doubt they are the same company.The ""10ga"" power and ground wire are actually 12ga wire in a 10ga jacket.Blue remote and speaker wire are literally hair thin. I didn't even know wire this thin actually existed. Talk about cutting corners and ripping off the customer.Fuse holder is also 12ga wire. RCAs and connectors seem okay.Still sitting here debating if I should return it because of false advertising."
4,double your pleasure,"2 well made tools.the utility knife is great and sees regular use. easy to open, easy to close, standard utility blades and it's very compact. 5 stars.the multi-tool replaced alot of individual tools in my on-site kit and has been very handy. it's very compact and feels rugged. some of the tools are difficult to open (very stiff) and/or can't be opened without opening the tool in front of them. not a huge deal, but not ideal. 4 stars."
2,Collection of Schematics,"Very disappointed. This book as stated before is a collection of schematics with no insight into the design or trade offs of one circuit over another. Only good thing I can say good about this book is, it contains an example of different amplifier circuits in one place. Most amplifiers in this book use opamps. Do not buy this book if you are looking to learn about amplifier design. This is at best a picture book."
5,Very Useful and Interesting,"The great thing about this book is that it is an extensive library of working circuits with component values. This provides an excellent service as a reference design for a circuit designer, i.e. a starting point for someone who already has design chops. If you lack design chops, probably better to reference one of the thousands of books written from the perspective of explaining the basics of circuit theory. This book was never intended to be a primer on the basics of circuit theory but instead a collection of reference designs vastly useful to a design engineer."
3,Needs something more.....,"I prefer more ""fun"" reading than the lifeless drumming in Frommer Travel books. I would like to see more travel books on the Amalfi area, but as choices are very slim, this may be the best available, at least to date."
3,Decent light reading,"Lady Helen, a geriatric British aristocrat, gains revenge on people involved in the killing of her son. While not very believable, and not one of Higgin's better works, it's a quick and mostly enjoyable read with familiar characters. The two major annoyances throughout the book were:1. EVERY character talks about the joys of smoking. It appeared to be a paid advertisement for Marlboros and the emphasis he placed on the dialogue related to smoking detracts from the story.2. EVERY American character uses British phrases and discusses their love of things British from meat pies to Harrods.If a friend gives you the book and there isn't anything better to read, it will pass the time."
3,My First Higgins Read--I'm Impressed and Will Read More!,"95% of what I read is non-fiction--but living in the D.C. area for eight years, and learning everything I could about the area and its key inhabitants--this book caught my eye. This is my very first Higgins read and I will seek other Higgins books. The author kept me fully engaged on two business flights--I don't even remember the snack on the flight. This book will take you from the White House--to the United Kingdom and back on the Concord or US Government Aircraft, with many plots taking place, key people involved, and many connections on both continents taking place at the same time--you will be itching for the flight to be over--to get the key players where they need to be. The bumper-sticker for this book--""revenge--above the law decision makers--perfection--knowledge is power"". A quick, but engaging read."
2,A nice book if you want some mindless entertainment.,"Maybe Higgins has a contract that needs to be completed. I read this book in one sitting - but not because it was a page turner. Well, it was a page turner because there were hardly any words on the page!This was a weak effort. Parts were very corny, the plot had no depth, as did none of the characters who we have met before but learned nothing new.It's time for something new and different Jack. Sean Dillon is over the hill!"
2,"A vengeful mom ""smokes"" the bad guys.","If this group of characters had been half as tough as they appeared, at least some of them could have given up smoking. This was not up to Higgin's prior works. He went out of his way to explain why they all lit up and failed to develop either the plot or characters. Perhaps he felt that he had done this in his previous books. Same characters - same plot."
3,Fairly interesting but nothing new here.,"It was nice to have Dillon back, but this was the most predictable and underdeveloped Higgins book yet. Dillon and company were too mellow and simplistic in my opinion. If you are a fan of the other Sean Dillon series of books you will probably enjoy it, but it's nothing spectacular. I think Higgins needs to work a lot harder on developing his characters and finding some new plots..."
2,Mediocrity from one of the genre's best,"Jack Higgins returns to the present, with Sean Dillon, Charles Ferguson, and Blake Johnson starring in a thriller about a vengeful killer of a bunch of Irish thugs. I have liked his WW2 era thrillers much better. THE EAGLE HAS LANDED and the recent FLIGHT OF EAGLES were both outstanding. THE WHITE HOUSE CONNECTION was the worst of the 10-plus books that I have read written by Higgins -- predictable, overly simplistic, and, in the end, rather boring."
2,"Been there, done that","Same old stuff. The book has the same level of entertainment as his past books, but how about coming up with some new twists."
3,Great Light Reading,"Like the reviewer, nobizinfla, this is my first Jack Higgins book. I enjoyed the plot. I think using this Lady Helen, an elderly aristocrat, as some well oiled killing machine out to avenge the death of her son while acting as part time vigilante, was a great idea. But for others like me and nobizinfla, beware that this is writing for fans of action hero Sean Dillon that must cut to the chase. They'er not to worried about a bunch of discriptive passages or deep character exploration. They don't even worry whether a character appears a bit to stereotypical, like Lady Helen's driver, an African-American named Hedley Jackson from Harlem. But asside from this, aside from the paper thin, television show diologue that is common in such genre books, The White House Connection is good light reading."
4,Avid Reader,"I very much enjoy reading and Jack Higgins is the latest in my ""new authors"" catagory. I've been able to find his books that I want to read at very good prices on line. Good delivery time and in good condition."
2,Simplistic but with suspense,"I think this book is not worth much. The story is simplistic and slow up to the half of the book. Then the suspense kicks in and you don't want to put it down. The description of the characters, however, lacks depth. On top of this the author seems to know his homeland (Britain) very well while his description of the United States is very much lacking. (see use of words, habits that are described)The characters on both sides of the ocean just seem to be interested in the case. The union worker is connected to the mob, a typical stereotype. The president, whose name is Cazalet, seems unrealistic. We never hear of his security detail and he just seems to think that smoking is OK but a trouble if his voters hear it. Otherwise he seems to lack any political convictions or plans (i.e. what is his take on the Northern Ireland problem?).The book also talks alot about the situation in NIreland and peace but very little about the issues involved. Should every reader be an expert?"
1,It Pains Me...,"...to rate this book so low. I am a long time fan of Jack Higgins having enjoyed his books since I was a teen. I don't know if the writing has deteriorated or maybe my tastes have matured, but I could not finish this book. The plot was stale, the dialouge staged and it just failed to generate any suspense at all. Maybe it's time for the Sean Dillon series to end, I know there are several more after this. Whatever happened to the Martin Brosnan character? He and Dillon have an old score to settle. Now that would make an interesting book."
3,An OK read...,"..but not the best. I have difficulties with superheroes who are capable of leaping tall buildings with a single bound, speaking 20 languages fluently and invariably surface from the most incredible mayhem with hardly a scratch. Moreover, coming from Northern Ireland, I have difficulty believing in Sean Dillon as a real product of the province. The story itself is entertaining enough, but lacking in suspense and in basic credibility (the same chameleon-like qualities is shown by Higgins's blue-blooded heroine who adeptly turns her hand to major league assasination, apparently without any problem)."
2,"Good writer, poor writing.","I ordinarily like Jack Higgins' books, but the dialogue in this one was juvenile. The plotting was okay, but the character, Sean's, over-used, back slapping, ""I don't care if I die"" dialogue is just silly after a while. Ferguson is an over-stuffed Englishman. When Higgins writes dialogue for his Americian characters, their dialogue sounds English, not American. This book needed an editor familiar with American idiom. Higgins can do better."
1,This ain't the Higgins I used to admire,"After an interesting prologue, it's straight down the metaphorical tube. The plot doesn't thicken. It's thin gruel all the way. This is about as weak a story as Higgins has produced. Come on Jack, you can do so much better! It's obvious that no research was done regarding the site of an important part of the plot--Park Avenue, in Manhattan. It just isn't like that. His scenes there are pure fairy tale. I guess, '...Connection's suitable for a mindless read at the beach. One afternoon should do it."
4,Give Me More!,"I love this book. Especially Sean D., but thats besides the point. It was worth the sleep I lost while reading it. This book and all the others are worth reading. Flight of Eagles is also worth missing sleep for. Only a few books have ever made me feel so strongly after finishing that I have wanted to read it again, just so I didn't lose that feeling. I WANT MORE!"
4,Solid Higgins storyline,"This is solid Higgins stuff with a good plot that kept me turning the pages. My only complaint is that if he's going to write about Americans, he needs to make them speak like Americans. Having the Americans speak like they're British distracts from an otherwise good story. A great quick read."
3,Enjoyable reading--but not as good as past!,"While I have always enjoyed reading his books--since The Eagle Has Landed--I don't think this one matches his previous endeavors. While Sean Dillon, Ferguson, and the rest of the gang can be very interesting characters, they fall short on development in this so-so novel. I thought it was a decent plot, but just not developed well enough for my tastes."
2,Originality please!,"Good God! Mr. Higgins it seems has done himself in again on another book starring the invincible Sean Dillon using the same lines that all the rest of his books have. (Next time a WASP says ""Good God!"" when confronted with shocking news, please notify me)(also ""Damn you!"" and many other old Higgins 'classic' cliches) all in all this book looks like taken from a bunch of his other novels cut apart and taped together in one big book. definitly not 'Eaglehas Landed' or 'Eye of the Storm'."
3,Just started reading ....,"Never read one of Higgins' books before, but I wanted to give it a try. It appears, though, that Jack has quite a bit in common with Snoopy when it comes to writing. He began this one the way Snoopy begins all of his. I read the first sentence and laughed, so I'll keep going and write an update later. That first sentence?""Manhattan, with an east wind driving rain mixed with a little sleet along Park Avenue, was as bleak and uninviting as most great cities after midnight, especially in March.""Or, as Snoopy would write: ""It was a dark and stormy night!"""
2,Predictable!,"The White House Connection is a predictable story. And not very suspensful.The novel is about a mother who avenges the death of her son at the hands of the IRA. The mother, in her late fifties, is the least believable of the characters in the book. When she finds out that her son was done in by treachery, she traipses between the US and England killing the bad guys. Huh? Where did she suddenly develop this uncanny ability to stalk and kill? This character, Lady Lang, threw me off the book from the start. I just wished that Jack Higgins had developed a better story than this. It would seem that he is running out of fresh ideas.I stayed, painfully, with the book until the end because of Sean Dillon and gang. It was nice to have them back again. Dillon was a bit laid back this time around. More action next time, Dillon.Higgins should go back to his WWII themes. They were his best. Try harder next time, Jack!"
1,What happened to Higgins?,"This book was not worth the time I spent reading it. The plot is totally predictable and doesn't challenge the reader in the least. A trite, boring story. What happened to Higgins?"
3,The case is good (but it doesn't fit the duel fuel 295 model),"The case works well, the latching mechanism is O.K. (two plastic squeeze tabs) but not great (or I would have given more stars).As another reviewer has noted, this case does not fit the larger lanterns. I bought this case because it was the one pictured with the lantern I have being sold as a lantern case combo -- shame on me for not verifying it fit my model of lantern (model 295)."
1,Bad Bottom Latch,"I put my lantern in the case for the first time, and the bottom did not fully latch. When I picked it up from the top handle, the bottom fell out after walking a few feet and the globe shattered."
2,No storage area on the bottom as advertised,Received the first one without any bottom at all !!! Amazon was great in sending a replacement However its advertised to be able to store mantles and matches in a bottom storage compartment I like to keep everything together so I have reverted back to keeping the lantern funnel matches and mantels in the original cardboard box which everything fits great. Amazon has been great but this case just fits the lantern !!!!
4,A must,Everyone with a Coleman lantern should have one of these. The cover protects the globe from being easily broken when storing or traveling. Only one thing could make it better and that is if it included a bit more storage space for the small funnel needed to refill the lantern.
1,Another Disappointment,"Although this item states it is intended for the model number of the lantern I was purchasing, it was not. The lantern was bigger than the container. Amazon quality control is dropping of significantly, Bezos better get back on top of his V.P.'s pretty quick."
2,Cheap,Well... its better than nothing. But if your not paying attention to the lame plastic catchy thing that holds it together you will more than likely have a broken lantern when you pick it up. Would not buy again. Rick Garner
2,too general,"the book was too general to be helpful. although ""training"" touched on all of the subjects in which i was interested, it provided few specific details that would help me develop my own training program. the list of possible speed drills and exercises is basically limited to one page. additionally, exercises mentioned throughout the text are often not fully described anywhere. if you are a beginner (like i am) you will need another source to tailor a personal training schedule. and if you are past the beginner stage, i do not imagine this text will offer anything in the way of new information."
3,"Smooth, but Heavy and Slow","The bike is decently built and is much more comfortable than any racing or mountain bike. However, the gear system is only fair with the lowest gear not all that effective. I use 1,2, or 3 only with very little opportunity to use the rest. The weight of the bike is notable, and you pay for the comfort with the extra weight. The seat height adjustment has been difficult to stabilize since I must extend it to the limit. The look of the bike is very retro and colorful. Smoother ride and 50's look was what attracted me. My only regret is that the gear system falls far short of what I would have liked."
2,Looks old and product was not covered with a seal,Was not happy with this purchase really should have returned it. Product was shifted to one side upon removing the top it was not covered with a foil insert over product as far as I know someone could have used it and sent to me. Did not have an aroma of any sort. Was not pleased with this at all. I've used this product line before because I purchase it when I was in Hawaii I don't know what happened with this container.
5,The National Flaf:A History,"I am doing reasearch on Mary Pickersgill, the woman who sewed the Star Spangled Banner. The book contained bits of useful information."
3,A Little Outdated,"I've been a mason for 15 years. And there are alot of benefits to the brick portion of the book. But the impression they leave, which is why I bought the book in the first place, lacked. Their blueprint reading section leaves much to be desired. Granted it does show some symbols, but it never explains what those symbols are or how they are used in a commercial setting. I was also under the impression that I was getting the 5th ed. and was sent the 4th edition. I don't know how much more they updated their book, but the block they use in their pictures, and the legends they use for the prints are way out of date. Perhaps they were masons in the 1950's or something. I really wouldn't recommend this book unless you know nothing about masonry, block, brick or print reading. But if you are green, this book is for you. You could build something successfully by the instructions of this book. But if you are serious about progressing in masonry as a career...find another book."
3,Conventional textbook to supplement DIY'er,"DIY books usually skip fundamentals, as they are often intended simply to persuade DIY'ers to hire contractors instead of actually educating them about a skill set. In contrast, this book is a conventional textbook, what you would likely find in your local vo-tech school, all the basics and history of the tradecraft. You won't find this book at Home Depot or local bookstore.Reading this book will not make you a mason, but it should help you be a less-bad DIY'er. It should also help you better appreciate the range of factors that affect masonry job estimates, and make you a better masonry customer when DIY is not a reasonable option. I did a tiny 20-block drainage pit rebuild after reviewing this book, and it definitely improved the quality of my work.Very cheap on the reused market, this book would have been a bargain at twice the price."
1,"only brick works, no advise on stone masonry","I need to build a stone wall and stone patio, stone walk way and a stone trail path, so I choose this book, but I find this book is a thorough brick textbook, even someone called a stone masonry master book. What a dispointing!! Be careful when you choose this book!"
3,"Good relaxing music, mediocre lectures","The relaxing music on this CD is pretty unique. It utilizes exotic instruments and it seems to me it is being played very much from the heart. I often use this CD when doing yoga or meditating.The first CD which contains a lecture is not nearly as interesting. It is somewhat entertaining, but after you have heard it one or two times you probably won't want to listen to it again. Although Dr. Weil is a physician, a lot of what he says in this CD is speculative and some of the conclusions he draws are a real stretch for me.Pat"
5,WOW!,This is one of the most incredible pieces of music I have ever listenend to. I listen to it alot and never tire of it. The sounds are a unique assembly of instruments. They come together in such a way that I feel like I've taken a mini vaction after every listen.
3,"Weil, Self Healing",Liked this one and so did a friend. They talk and them play the music as they used it in examples. dth
4,Wonderful tape for hard times,This tape is very easy to take even for non-newagers. The Doc is a nice and interesting guy with a good voice.Kimba is a delight with a Hawaiian aura and fabulous instruments which she plays in a beautiful way.The musical part of the tape is lovely and relaxing.Weil's whole series is great for people in crisis who need to focus their brains to help them heal and deal with pain.Check it out!
5,LOVE IT!!!,"""Self Healing with Sound & Music"" does exactly what the title implies. The first CD is quite informative and I enjoyed Dr. Weil's explanation on the effect sound has on our body and mind. The second CD sends you into another world it is so soothing. If you are under stress, having health issues, or just want to relax and unwind I would recommend this CD."
1,I am so disappointed!,"This is the first time that I have ever received an item from Amazon that I would like to return. I found no 'healing powers' in the music... in fact I found it annoying. I will not even listen to it a 2nd time. I tried to leave this CD product NO rating.... less than one, but the system does not allow it."
3,cozy is really too old to play rock,Although cozy is playing so hard in the rock for 30years. but he is really too old to play rock.I'll still memorize the years he play in the rainbow. This album is the 5th solo album of cozy. many new rock musician playing in this album. they play a better music than cozy. cozy just do a good job in his playing. but the other musician do a excellent job. from the start to the end of this album is a blues rock album not a rock drummer solo album. that is all my feeling of this album.
4,A brief but fascinating story,"Year f the Unicorn is a somewhat odd Witch World spinoff. It depends heavily on journeys through nightmare dream landscapes, which I must confess I have always had trouble following. But the core characters are strong and the central dilemma compelling. I read this many, many years ago and recalled enjoying it, and then just reread it and found it a delight. Not a must read from the Witch World stories, but still worthwhile."
2,I don't understand the rave reviews,"Perhaps other folks' expectations were lower. This item arrived packed in a large box with lots of butcher-weight paper. It seemed well protected but there was still bits of chipped enamel in the bottom of the basin which all seem to have come from the rim. The rim itself is the most disappointing aspect of this item. It is rough and not turned all the way, as well as losing it's enamel. The enameled finish itself is the worst I've seen (but I only have GSI Outdoor and Le Creuset enamelware) - it is bubbly with raised points, and unevenly applied. I'm sure this item will hold water for washing just fine (as of yet, there doesn't seem to be a hole in the bottom), but the overall quality is lackluster. I won't be returning it, but I wouldn't have purchased it had I known..."
3,"okay, not great","Pros--nice looking, almost decorative. You could hang it on the wall as decoration. It's also quite large--big enough for HUGE batches of anything.Cons-- as soon as I took it out of the box, I put a SLIGHT bit of pressure on the handles to test its strength--just a bit of pressure. It made a cracking sound. I could tell that if I had pushed just a tiny bit harder, the handle would have separated from the dish. So I'm worried that if I fill it up with water, or something heavy, the handles may not hold. I guess they don't make 'em like they used to."
4,Love my Granny Pan!,"I've wanted these ever since the one my grandmother had disappeared! It's the size I remember, and has new uses daily! The only reason that it does not have five stars is that it is BLUE. On the page from where I ordered it, it was white, which I wanted because it looked like grandma's."
5,15 quart dish pan,"This worked very well for the use we put it to. It replaced a 4 quart dog dish that was used as a water resevoir for a Christmas tree, This kept the tree nice and green and did not need water added often, since it was much larger than the dog dish. It is a well made pan that worked well for this."
3,granite dish pan,"Packaging was awful, partially opened and ""bouncing around"" in the giant smashed box. A few chips on rim. Was sold as 'used' so I guess in decent shape."
2,"Good pan, bad packaging","The pan itself is okay. I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks extra for a bit thicker steel for better heat dissipation, though.However, there is a big issue with packaging of this item. Amazon ships it in 2A6 box - where the pan barely fits. The first one I ordered arrived in bubble wrap - but, because of the tight fit between the pan and the box, the bubbles around the edge of the pan were deflated. As a result, one of the edges of the pan was bent and the porcelain coating chipped/cracked at the bend. I requested a replacement - the replacement came in the same box type with no bubble wrap around the pan at all - just some paper thrown into the box. Fortunately, it was in somewhat better condition - the edge was slightly chipped, but not bent, and the chipping is on the outside - so porcelain touch-up can be used to repair it (the touch-up should not come in contact with food)."
2,GPX Products Fail within 6 months,I have owned 3 different GPX products some lasted a month but most failed after 6 months. Including the unit they sent me to replace a defective product.
3,just ok,"not ground breaking. bought this based on reviews, not bad. nothing unique. there are dozens of other colognes that smell similar. kind of a disappointment being its from givenchy.expected much more"
5,Fresh and active!,I had this before and I ordered it again because it's the best specially for summer time. It's scent is cold with an odor of lime if I can say so!It's so freshening! :)
3,Little boys love this video!,This is a great video for small boys. My three year old watches it over and over. If you have a fledgling architect in the family this video is for you! Lots of trucks and machinery. Great visuals!
3,Plastic is plastic,I have purchased three of these during the time I have had the Python. The Python sysem is wonderful at $40 for the whole system new. Purchasing a few replacements parts cost more than half a whole new system. The plastic pump is fragile so this one I store in a tin box to protect it. The manufactures said they could make it out of a heavy metal but it would cost much more so they keep it plastic.
1,"Yes, it is convenient but not durable","I bought our python about 4 months ago and we just ordered our third nozzle. After the first nozzle broke, we were very careful and the 2nd nozzle still broke. The plastic threads on the nozzle break apart after it is on the faucet. This is a great, innovative product and it does really help with changing the water, but I wish they would use a higher quality product and charge more money, if needed."
3,Wish there were metal ones,"Replacement for broke one. This one also squirts by the neck. Always disconnect hose before moving the hose, so it doesn't wiggle the pump, and break it. FINGER TIGHT ONLY!!! or you will wear down the cheap, plastic screw grooves."
1,Be prepared to buy new ones often...,"Great design in theory, but very cheaply built. They fall apart and/or crack in half with very little use. I guess it's a good thing they're somewhat cheap."
4,Neato!,"These are pretty neat, I like that they are canvas and collapsible. Will be getting a couple more for the closet!"
3,"Not exactly what I'd hoped,,,","I found these to be rather flimsy for my purposes. Maybe they would work well for a college student, but I needed something more sturdy. I returned them and went with the Tribeca line at another store. If Amazon would sell storage items of that caliber, I would purchase them from Amazon. I also purchased some steel reinforced fold-able material boxes. Again, if Amazon would carry them I would purchase them here.I hope they will consider carrying higher quality storage items in the future as this Rubbermaid style of container is neither durable nor very versatile, even at this low price."
3,"Ordered Fleur-di-Lis pattern, got neutral; lining did not fit one box","Although I do like the boxes enough not to send back,the order was wrong and one box was defective. I orderedthe Fleur-di-lis pattern and got all neutral. One box wasdeficient. The lining did not fit, and I can't use the box.Am hesitant to order again from amazon.com"
5,This is a wonderful tape!,"The Zambian Acapella Choir and also the Zambian Acapella Boys Choir are amazing! Every recording they have put out have been wonderful. The Original Choir did three tapes (including this one) and the Boys Choir did one tape. All are wonderful and I would reccomend them to anyone. The love they have for the lord shows not only in their music, but also on their faces. If you have never heard the Zambian Acapella Choirs, I strongly encourage you to order this tape. You won't be sorry!"
2,Trollope or Simon Raven,"It may be incipient senility, but I don't remember Trollope being as heavy-handed and tedious as this. To be fair, I bailed early in season 1. (Does Plantagenet look like Ed Muskie?) There are other dramatizations of Trollope. Perhaps I'll try those.Raven's (largely UK) reputation as a novelist is quite high. Perhaps I'll try those. Rather ironic, considering my view of this."
3,Smelly,"I bought this pool this summer. Everything worked great for awhile, until I left it out for a week - using cleaning tools and chemicals recommended by my local pool supply company (as recommended by Aqua Liesure). Left the pool out for a week and it developed an odor that was intolerable, unremovable, became imbedded in the water, clinged to everyone who came in touch with it (my yard still has the odor) and I finally had to take it to the dump because no amount of cleaning would fix the problem. Good idea for a pool, but Aqua Leisure should provide more information than ""set it up and ask someone else what to do about chemicals and problems"". Very little customer support from the manufacturer."
5,A Damn good book,"this book was an incredible read. i couldn't put in down to do anything else. it brought out a side of music and love that i would never have thought about. this book was also poetically based also,i peeped that cause i write also"
3,My Fair Lady the Remix,"I kept thinking I know this story. You will too if you have ever seen my Fair Lady.I have to agree with the Reader ""Nina"" There were times when I felt like oh Brother Where art thou, can we please just got on with the story, enough of this insighfulness stuff.over all tt was a pretty good story,But come on now, its one thing to fall in love with Bubba Gump Shrimp and Forrest Gump but ""Leroy's Oil"" But Mr. O Hobson, is a whole nother beast.It's a quick read and I think if you like Yolonda's other books then you will like this one."
1,Good concept-poor execution,"The story starts like a cross between Drumline and My Fair Lady.The idea has promise, but is executed poorly. The backstory doesnt adequately explain the rest of the story. We meet the characters as adults with only a smattering of info on their pasts and history.The language is horrible. Its one thing to have characters speak colloquial english, but the narrative is too ""slangy"" as well. Some of the metaphors make absolutely no sense. Its like the author is trying to be ""deep"" but it comes across as a big mess. After reading 3 pages that were so bad that I just laughed, I put the book down.I am saddened because it seems that in AA fiction, readers will accept anything. The quality of the writing was horrible, as if no one had edited it.Bah"
5,Quite Unique,The book is completely sourced-which is rather unique for a 'spy' book. Many former agents go on record for the first time. The 'Bayly' chapter alone contains numerous secrets previously unknown about the war. A must read for anyone interested in the War or espionage.
1,The True Intrepid,It seems that the author has researched and revewed previous books about William Stephenson. He is simply trying to discredit their content and has little to offer of his own as to Stephenson's work and associates. It was one book I could not finish.
1,very disappointing,"I read a lot and particularly enjoy biographies and books that relate to history. I was very disappointed by this book. Perhaps a person such as Sir William Stephenson is too shrouded in mystery to write a serious book. But if so, why should I waste my time reading about 'who said what' if nobody knows anything for sure? And, to be completely honest: I actually did not make it to the end - after reading half the book I gave up, utterly bored and disappointed. Perhaps the second half is better than the first, but I very much doubt it."
4,Good overview of Latin Jazz,"Be aware, as of this date, the Track Listings are 100% incorrect. This is a two CD set with 25 tracks. This has been pointed out to Amazon a couple of times, to no avail. You will have to check elsewhere on the Web to find the correct listings. High points include Tito Puente's version of Take Five, Pucho's Canteloupe Island, and Ray Barretto's Summertime. Sure, there are some songs I would not have included. Compilations are rarely perfect."
2,Did not see any difference.,I was disappointed using this product. Did not see any improvement in my windshield or vision in fact it seemed to smear my windshield more.
3,Seems to work,"Everyone told me to get this, and I did, a little early to tell if it works well, but my car likes it, and it is god to have the added confidence that this is on our car...."
1,$888.88!??,There must be a mistake. The price of this product was increased to $888.88. I wonder if the Rain-X now includes a car to put it on.
4,"It works, but...","In high speed ( over 40 - 45 ml) it works as described. But driving in town whit lower speed, it makes even worst. I do not complain much, but my wife."
5,Found it here!,I love this product. It seems to be the right blend of RainX protection and wiper lube. I could not find it in the stores anymore (may have been discontinued) so I found it here online.
5,This stuff is great,"the auto parts stores used to cary this stuff, but its becoming hard to find in stores. Add a couple ounces to a gallon washer fluid and you wont believe how well the water rolls off. At highway speeds, most of the water will clear itself. I live in Seattle, and this product is a necessity. Its a great alternative to the traditional rain-x that needs to be polished on the windshield."
2,One secret...this is not a very good movie,"To cover up for a story that was uninteresting, the producer and director knew that they must do something to save such a bad script. They did!! They filmed some of the best and fastest fight scenes in the Ocean Shore Catalog.The story seemed to be about a man who was on the run and who was always being hunted down for no apparent reason. Villian after villian is hired to kill this guy but there is no way for them to match his high skills as he defeats them easily. Enter in his master who only begins to teach him kung fu after he has already beaten several other men. (made no sense...it never seemed that he needed to be taught when he already appeared to be very very good!!!) The master teaches him about the 18 weapons of kung fu...which he never really used.Overall don't watch this movie for a plot or story..there is none. Watch it for the great fight scenes!!! (4 stars for fights 2 stars for the plot)"
2,Limited Use,"This is a good product... However, one draw back is if your clients do not use a current version of Quickbooks it is not helpful."
3,I thought this movie was hilarious,"I ended up seeing this film, on one of the movie channels on my cable. I usually don't like soft-core pornography, but this movie is more about the laughs than it is about the sex.I think it's funny how the husband is so estatic that he has a lesbian for a wife, until he's out of the picture.I really just thought this film was hilarious, and because it doesn't focus only on the sexual aspect I'm going to reccomend it to alot of my friends."
3,"Well intended, but quite not there yet!","Here is a comedy, touching on an ever popular fantasy that keeps coming up in people's conversation,or thoughts, from time to time. I liked their agressive style, and the principal actors are doing a good job, and they look good doing whatever they do, but, and this is my but, there seemed to be too many sexual escapades on behalf of the female lead(Mariel Hemingway), but you do not get to be invited to be in the scenes, in most cases is insinuated hapening out of camera range. And without asking for an NC-17 rating version a little less quantity and more tactful presentation on a few would be more my taste. All in all, for the comedic challenge it was a good film."
3,"Sex Monster Movie Starring Mariel Hemmingway,Funny and Good Moral Story/ending.","I liked this movie, It has a Good Moral story to it, a good ending. the guy literally opened up a Pandora's box. If your Married(which is Sacred) you should haven't anything outside of that. it's that simple between a Man and A woman. if you can't make up your mind then don't get married. So the movie yes has alot of Scenes I don't mind watching, but as it winds down to me it got better and you realize that relationships especially marriage are sacred.So I like it's ""Preachy"" tone as one reviewer put it. 3-4 stars.and Mariel Hemmingway is ugly."
5,Great sex comedy/farce,"I have to say this is the funniest little comedy I have watched in years. I have seen it pop up on HBO a lot and missed it and finally rented it and enjoyed the hell out of it. I have been laughing my self sick at HBO'S MIND OF THE MARRIED MAN and think Mike Binder is the best new comic to come around since I fist saw Steve Martin in the seventies. He's got the best droll take on marriage and I'm guessing this film is the forerunner of his tv show. He's an ispired comic and as a director gets a wicked performance from Mariel Hemingway who has got great timing and is still, I have to say, awesome to look at. Steve Baldwin is in this and so is Kevin Pollack. Both very funny. Fast, silly, sexy, racy, and inspired. Rent it, buy it whatever. I think this was Binder's first movie and I predict he's going to be a guy on the level of Woody Allen one day.Mike Taylor. Kalamazoo Michigan"
1,5th rate Woody Allen rip off.....,"So many things are wrong with this movie--where to begin? Well, first of all, and most importantly, it's a movie about sex, with ""sex"" in the title, and you don't SEE ANY SEX IN THE ENTIRE FILM!!!... That was a mistake. Second, this guy who's the main character is doing the worst Woody Allen imitation I have ever seen. Worse than Jason Alexander during the first season of Sienfeld! Thirdly, someone thought it would be cool to put old, late 60's Jamaican rocksteady in this movie. No movies have rocksteady in them. I love rocksteady. Why did they have to put it in this movie???!!!... WHY????!!!...What a waste of great tunes.....Peace."
4,sex monster,"Very funny movie for couples that might want to explore the spicy threeway lifestyle.This movie tells us,be careful for what you wish for,because you just might get it,but is it worth it."
2,Not as funny as it wished it could have been,"Horny husband is obsessed with the hetero male sex fantasy of a threesome with two women, talks his wife into it, and then -- oh-oh, be careful what you wish for. The real comedic moments in this exaggerated and ultimately strained comedy occur when Mr. Husband begins to realize that Mrs. Wife and the second woman in the sexual escapade can do very well without him in the bedroom. Predictably, he resents his wife's discovery of her sexual joy with females and his fantasy-come-true starts to become a nightmare. The Freudian pink elephant in the room is how she, who had no interest in exploring sexual adventures, is deemed the ""sex monster"" when it was he who had a sex monster inside his brain begging for an opportunity to destroy marital boundaries. And there must be something spiking this film's Southern California drinking water, because the married are either unfaithful or frustrated -- and the singles succumb easily to temptation."
4,Great no spill sippy cup,"This is the only type of sippy that my son will drink from. I love that it's an innexpensive cup, but also durable. He tosses it around like a typical one year old but it never leaks! The valve can possibly be dislodged with some hard knocks, but it's only happened to us once so far."
2,NOT leak proof or spill proof.,"I have searched ALL over to find a working sippy cup. I have 2 kids. 4 years and 18 months. We tried this cup since it was inexpensive. The first use, we had milk in it. My 18 month old dropped the cup and milk splattered out of the valve. Some days she turns is over and milk, juice, etc drips out allowing her to make milk designs on the table, etc. If left turned over, it will drain. Big puddles on car seat, lap, chairs, carpet, etc. I am very disappointed."
1,MA Mommy of 2,"I am writing for anyone who may be considering this cup. I searched amazon for a simple, no spill cup. I read the reviews to make sure I was getting a good product. This cup received 5 stars. I would not give it more than 1 star. The valve works great. That is not what makes it leak. It actually leaks out the side. Trust me, I am not new to the whole sippy cup world. I have tried several brands. I also know that sometimes it is your error and you need to try putting the cover on again. That was not the problem. Now, these cups were very inexpensive so I am not too upset. I just wished that they worked! I will continue to use them but only for water."
2,Keep Getting Pink,"We order many children's items for our boy on Amazon. Many of these don't give you an option of choosing a color. Be warned, Amazon has nothing but pink stuff laying around. Of the 10 ""colors vary"" things we've ordered for ourselves and friends 8 of them have been pink. No blues, greens, yellows. Just pink pink pink.The cup is great but unless you like pink I would just buy from your local BRU."
2,"Great cups, bad seller.","I ordered four of these cups because I own one and my 10 month old can drink from them easily. They do not require excessive suction and for the most part they don't leak. I had a hard time finding them in the store so I was excited to find them on Amazon.hen they arrived, however, they were coated in some kind of nasty grease. I am not sure if they were used before, but they certainly needed extensive cleaning before even considering for use.In short, I recommend these cups highly as a more substantial alternative to the 'take and toss' cups that leak, but look for them elsewhere to get a shiny new cup."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"My daughter picked two of these cups up at a store and sucked on them -- so they came home with us. I was very skeptical because, really? No spill -- please! But we tried them, and you know what? They haven't spilled. At all. I even took one and shook it upside down and nothing came out. So, call me impressed! I'm actually going back to the store today to pick up a couple more to replace the cups that DO spill and leak...They are fairly easy to clean and I like that there are flow options in fast or slow. Definitely loving this cup!"
5,For anyone considering film school or already there,"If you've ever thought about going to film school, if you're currently a student at a film school, or if you're struggling after having attended film school, this book should be in your ... shopping cart ASAP.If you're lucky enough to have Julie Maclusky as a screenwriting professor (as I did), you've already got an advantage - but if you're not so fortunate, you'll need the edge this book can give you. Inside, you'll find interviews with a number of now-successful film students - proof that it is possible. And, there are more opportunities out there than you might think. This book can help you find them..."
1,"If you need to spend [$] for some hope, you already lost.","There is not a lot of depth in the in-depth interviews. Everyone especially wants to share how to write a script, but that is what we just went to film school for four years to learn isn't it? We don't need that, we need to learn how to get a job, what the different jobs really are and what they are advertised to be and what the pitfalls are. To do that we need canded advice and I think that anonymous interviews would have been better since that would have given some of the hard truths that film school and Hollywood staffers can't share truthfully or people up the food chain make grudges for exposing them. I agree with the pictures, they are so self-imporant it is funny. But overall I just don't think this book is as advertised. It's not really going to help anyone just out of film school unless you can flatter one of the people interviewed in the book. It's not bad, just not really what it thinks it is. It's like ""People"" Magazine."
3,"Fun...but some problems, too!","I enjoyed the majority of this DVD, however, I do have some issues with it as well:1. Under the sketch gallery, the selections change at their own pace. The forward and back keys do not work, so you must move through at a pre-selected pace.2. The ""Top Cat"" theme under the jukebox is truncated.3. The ""Jetsons"" episode includes an episode placard between the opening credits and the actual show. These episode placards were not used in the original broadcast...they were an addition years later, when the studio tried unsuccessfully to mix newly drawn episodes in with the old ones for syndication.4. The opening and closing credits to ""Top Cat"" are extremely soft.5. The jukebox selections for Yogi and Huckleberry were not for their shows, but for individual episodes only.I also have to wonder why ""Scooby-Doo"" was included with all of these early 60's cartoons.That being said, I'd love to see them bring out more 60's H-B cartoons in this format."
5,Like drops of water for a person dying of thirst,"My only critisim is that more Flintstone, Top Cat, Jetsons, HBH et al cartoons are not available on DVD."
2,Not sure why my kids don't enjoy this video,"My kids love the cartoons that I grew up with, like Scooby Doo, and any TV/videos for that matter. But for some reason they loose interest in this DVD when I put it on for them. It may be because they like to watch a series of the same cartoon characters and this DVD has a variety of characters. I wish they would enjoy it more,but unfortunately it was a flop at our house."
3,Cartoon Crack-Ups,"This DVD is okay, but it contains a limited number of cartoons; I expected there to be more. I would recommend this as a sample cartoon DVD."
1,NOOOOOOOOOO!!!,"Damn Crazy Frog. Pardon my language, but that's how I feel, now that I learn about this piece of rubbish. They messed with QUEEN!!! NOOOOOO!!! I hope Crazy Frog never releases another album, to spare us all."
5,Fantastic,"I'm in a wide open space, i'm standing, i'm all alone, i'm staring in to space The best song on the album. You must buy this album they are all outstanding."
2,Sincerely overrated,"I bought this ages ago with high hopes, going on the basis of ""Wide Open Space"" and talk about it's brilliance from mates. And after a few listens I was left feeling empty to say the least! 1 star for WOS and 1 star because I was born in Chester."
5,Great story about Maryknoll,One does not realize the difficulties experienced by our foreign missionaries unless through first hand experience or by reading their literature. This book tells actual stories about Maryknoll missionaries and their efforts to help people in other countries. It is an easy read and gives a great appreciation for the dedication and faith of these men and women. I was so impressed after reading the book that I started donating to their cause.
5,Great Sneakers,"Stride Rite makes great sneakers. They are very durable as my son is wearing them at camp and in a sand park and they are holding up to the beating very well. He tends to drag his toes and where other sneakers have shown great wear at the tips, these are not wearing as quickly. Ultimately, working at his camp, I'm seeing how difficult it is for teachers/camp counselors to have to tie shoes all day. The velcro helps him either be more independent in putting on his shoes, or helps the process go more quickly in getting dressed. While I wish they were not white, they are much better than most of the ""cooler looking"" sneakers and I'm so pleased with the price as well as the half size (or wide as my friend was able to get, which she tells me are hard)."
2,Disappointing!,"I bought the first 4 books in the Bombshell Series, and this was the first one I read. What a disappointing start! I gave it 2 stars because although the author set up a pretty good plot, I just didn't care for what she did with it. It's always a bad sign when I start scanning through to get to the end, and that's what I did with this book. Also, there is very little romance in this book. Kai and Jake spend the whole time tip-toing around each other. Am I mistaken, or is this supposed to be a romance series? Hopefully, things will get better with the next book."
3,Wrong One,"The information said this would fit a 2002 Ford F150 Pickup. This item might be for a Ford F150 pickup,but it sure doesn't fit my 2002 Ford F150. Not even close."
3,Good Read For a Teen,"I read this book when I was a young boy and happened to stumble across it here on Amazon. I ordered a used copy and sat down to read it. It really is aimed to a younger reader and is a pretty quick read. Good story that is a little on the preachy side at times. Not a lot of deep thoughts or deep characters but your average 8th grader is likely to enjoy the book...heck, s/he can have mine!"
1,Pretty Slim,It only contains music from the later Pink Floyd catalogue. Not exactly their creative (or his) highpoint.
5,Best Of the Best Of,"This is a wonderful CD, a real overview of 10 of Ian's best years in music. Unfortunately, you can buy it less expensively on Ian's own website. Still, amazon.com offers a great deal of convenience. I highly recommend this!"
5,Great cd,"My older sister saw her in concert recently and bought the cd there for me (got it autographed). I can't say enough about her. If it were not for Janis Ian, there would be no Alanis or Fiona. I tried getting her played on a local radio station, and they said she was too controversial. You figure. This cd is a must have for any collection"
2,Any other guide would be a better choice,"Chose this guidebook over others as much to check out the Frommer's style as to get travel info. Normally I am a Lonely Planet guy, but since I was staying with friends didn't need a lot of in depth descriptions of logistics (lodging, travel etc.). Just looking for a description of some of the attractions.I found the guide difficult to use. Although I didn't need much in the way of logistical support, there was really very little. There were only about 4 maps in the whole book and they were spaced out all over the place. Virtually no information on specifics for those arriving overland. Worse, the descriptions of the attractions any sense of enthusiasm. Normally when I read a guidebook, I get the sense that sites are over-hyped, but this book almost made me want to skip the city altogether.I have found Frommers on-line a good source of info and reviews but won't be buying another of their guidebooks in the future."
3,caught in a leg trap,"I have used QB pro for years with several small businesses and find it invaluable...until it has a problem. I am buying 2 copies of 2002 not for the upgrade, but because it might be cheaper than paying $40 for every 10 minutes ($240 hour????) of tech support to try to fix a problem that intuit does not guarantee to fix (compatibility of my otherwise fine QB Pro 99 with windows XP). This charge is absolute usery and does not have a guarantee!I would very highly recommend looking at the options if you are not a QB user already. I can't recommend other programs as I am trapped in QB (or rather Quicksand?), and to try to leave now could cause far more trouble than it is worth."
2,Sizzle Without The Steak!,"Quickbooks 2002 is just another opportunity for Intuit to extract a few more dollars from your bank account. This product features items that are hardly worth the price tag, and according to my CPA, features that will hardly be used by even the most sophisticated accountant. Customer support is horrible. I used Quicken and then Quickbooks for quite some time and was very satisfied. Many of my associates have complained about their difficulties involved in navigating Quickbooks. This has not been a problem for me. I don't have an issue with Intuit and I am not a disgruntled consumer. Quickbooks is a great seller simply because people don't know any better. Unfortunately, the newer versions have higher price tags and are couple with less than optimum customer support. I am now using MYOB, and I will tell you that it's like a breath of fresh air."
1,Thinking of upgrading?? Don't!,"If you like your current Quickbooks bank statement reconciliation, forget the upgrade. It vanishes, and you get an extended register instead. The package says all former reports plus updated ones, but call support and ask for the old one and the response is, ""That isn't a valid question.""Currently running payroll on your version of Quick Books? You can't even use the one in QuickBooks Premier unless you pay extra to subscribe to their services.Once you upgrade, none of your data will work on the earlier copy of Quick Books. You are toast."
1,"Horible Support, Even Worse product",Do not buy this software unless you have deep pockets and don't mind spending lots of money on support. I don't want to sound paranoid but this software has bugs built into it to force you to call support. (did I mention the software come with 0 support) not 60 days not 30 days not even 1 day of support is included with the purchase.And all the great services that the product tells you about cost additional with monthly fees.
1,Worst Customer Services,I have the Quickbooks 2009...had to call customer service to get the software registered...was on the call for 1 hour and 31 minutes...over an hour on hold because I refuse to give a credit card number for the so called service plan...I asked the non English speaking rep to transfer me to a supervisor...she refused...out right refused...thank god there are other programs out there that do what Quickbooks does...you are completely correct....Intuit SUCKS...Don't buy this product...

3,jbl toy,Well let me start off saying i dont like jbl . i like the masterpiece chris masters and john cena they are the only ones that i like in the wwe. but this figure i personally dont like it the hat looks so stupid on him and it does not look like him in the face. and it is hard to play with because it is hard to bend him and he is not flexable at all if you bend him to much it will break him.
5,Easy to understand and easy to implement,"A very good book to help create the relaxation we all need to fight excess stress. Better than most books out on this subject. Well worth reading. I recommend it.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""Stress Management for Over-Achievers"" docwifford@msn.com"
3,13 Tracks!,"I enjoy Da Brat's music a lot, as I enjoy all music. Her flows, musical backups, and general aura are very pleasing and fun to listen to. This album would deserve 4 1/2 stars, if it wasn't so darn SHORT! It seems illogical to me to market a double CD with only THIRTEEN collective tracks. This whole thing could easily fit on one disc, which saves everybody money--retail, production, packaging, etc. It would be nice as a single album, but I paid WAY too much money for WAY too little music. In retrospect, it was fairly new then, which makes this a safe bet in 2000. I recommend this CD. Enjoy."
2,This CD stinks,"No wonder this is so cheap. Her voice is so annoying. On sitting on top of the world Im like hey, what is she talking about? Dont get this!!"
2,Nothing either new or helpful for those with some knowledge,"I am an adult woman with ADD, mother of two, so I was looking forward to hearing a different voice than you usually encounter in ADD books for the general public. Instead, it was pretty much fragmented kinds of suggestions and actually ended up making me feel less competent as a mother than I really am."
3,Homeschooling is HARDER with ADD???? No way!,"I feel as if I've read everything in this book in other books. It was positive, as some of the other reviewers stated, but it lacked some concrete examples of things that might help *me.*If a mother was just beginning to learn about ADD and how to manage ""it"" in her life, then I think this would be a nice place to start. But if an ADDer has already done the info-junkie bit, then I would skip this one.BTW, homeschooling has been far, far easier for me than sending my children to school. When my kids were in school there were all of these artificial outside schedules that did nothing for our home or our learning styles. I can focus on having fun with my kids now instead of on whether they like the meatloaf being served in the cafeteria, need a permission slip returned, had homework, were supposed to stay after school for an activity (or worse, needed to be picked up early because of a shortened school day!) Homeschooling RULES!"
5,"Thanks Katha, from a strengthened liberal","Katha has insightful, thought-provoking views on everything from welfare mothers . . . to abortion . . . to gun-control . . . to marriage and divorce . . . to school vouchers. Reading her wonderful, witty essays helped me gain new perspective on several issues. That is not to say that I agreed with everything she said, but I always enjoyed reading her well-written, funny, honest essays. I devoured this book in a couple of days of reading it when I could steal a moment or two. It is hard to put down. I feel renewed pride in calling myself a liberal."
5,Fascinating,"This is a fascinating account of a fascinating life. Tiersky's own interactions with Mitterand over his decades-long career provide insight and color without exaggerating the author's importance or insider status. Tiersky examines all the key chapters of Mitterand's career: his Vichy past, his Resistance involvement, the Observatory Affair, Mitterand's triumph over the Far Left, his anti-Soviet geopolitical maneuverings, and his curious extramarital affairs. Mitterand's contradictions and humanity make for great material, and Tiersky delivers a gripping read. This biography is nearly flawless with only minimal repetition near the end."
3,Be Cautious,"The sender got the book to me PDQ and it was in very good condition as advertised. No problems there. Reading the contents is another matter. I respect that this topic has not been covered very widely, and I was glad to find this book for that reason. I've been slowly making my way through it. As one who is widely educated and well read in the general area that the author references, I have to say that she is only mildly well researched herself, and the conclusions she draws from her sources and her (very narrowly chosen) group of responders is debatable at best. It's a worthy subject. I wish more people would work with it. But if someone new to the field takes the author's assertions as fact, they will be misled. Beyond not being much of a thinker, Caitlin Matthews is also not much of a writer, so...bravo for taking up a little discussed and worthy topic, but, please, someone who knows more about it, please right a better book! (I think this may have been a PhD dissertation?)"
1,Don't you think...,"Don't you think that if Cathie's conclusions were true, the information wouldn't be relegated to a publisher like Adventures Unlimited Press, which sells books by other authors in 'The Lost Cities', 'The Lost Science', and 'The Mystic Travelers' series? Why waste your time with this? Most of the discussion in Cathie's books is focused on very loosely-formulated 'harmonics' math and UFO sightings (enough said). Use Amazon's 'Look Inside' feature and see for yourself. The reviewer below ('Not even pseudo-science') has it right."
5,Great work by De Angelis.,"I have always enjoyed De Angelis' music, from ""Pregonera"" to ""La Cumparsita"". His music is elegant and guarantees to satisfy all tastes. In this CD you will find an excellent release of ""Mi Dolor"" and ""La Cumparsita"". This CD contains very danceable, and some times ""fast"", Argentine Tango pieces, and for those who are more into DiSarli's slower interpretations this CD will still be a wonderful experience. The recording quality is also excellent. A must have!"
3,late De Angelis,"these instrumentals belong to De Angelis' late period. Whilst everyone will agree that ""Pavadita"" is an excellent track, opinion will be divided about the other tracks presented here. In the post golden age period the orchestras had to reduce in size and the lines of bandoneons and violins are audibly reduced here, lending a thin texture to the music. The arrangements are predictable and unadventurous, even by De Angelis' standards. Nevertheless, those whose main consideration is sound fidelity will be pleased. Purists will be disappointed."
4,Nice Serving Set,This is a basic serving set that will go well with many patterns. Substantial weight and seems to be made well. Good value.
4,Must read classic of Christian spiritualism.,"Whether your interest in this title stems from an interest in medieval literature or Christian mysticsm, this book is a must. It is part of the flowering of thought which occurred in Europe 1250-1400 which changed the way we think about the relationship between Man and God. It is a guide to a personal search for an understanding of God."
3,falls short of shooters quality,"this was not a bad book, but it certainly was not on the level of shooters. other than the absurdity of the storyline, it was very well written and the characters were believable (except of course, for one of them!!) i didn't expect a book like this from the same guy who wrote ""shooters"" which was excellent. not a bad read, if you enjoy reading about things that aren't real"
2,"A very good read, pity about the proof-reading.","This book is an excellent read. See all the other reviews for praise.Do not buy the kindle version! It is spoilt not by poor proof-reading, but by the lack of any proof-reading whatsoever - it's full of OCR errors.Buy a print version."
4,Excellent book,"Well worth buying since this area has not been properly covered to my knowledge. Disagreeably journalistic style.With all due respect to Dowding and none to the Air Ministry, someone should extend the book's scope and write a book on all the cock-ups and how they came into being and were tolerated. Examples: Leigh Mallory insubordination, no camouflage paint on planes, why 1932 jet wasn't developed, formation flying, no deflection shooting practice, insufficient swopping of fatigued/fresh pilots between groups, no calling back of semi-trained pilots who were jettisoned before finishing courses, etc, etc. Most of these errors were obvious before fighting started.A Summer Bright and Terrible: Winston Churchill, Lord Dowding, Radar, and the Impossible Triumph of the Battle of Britain"
5,Marvellous,"I discovered Lord Dowding as the author did through Dowdings book ""Lynchgate"". The Battle of Britain, whilst not the saviour as most believe put a serious dent in Hitlers War Machine. Britain was to remain free and a ""stepping stone"" back into Europe.Without Lord Dowding none of this would have been achieved. Bombing had been shown to be the way of modern warfare and fighters stuck in a time warp could not catch them. Dowding's obstinacy and prescience established a data-linked system of radar, operation rooms and fighters. Without him the World may have been a much different place.Since owning and reading the book, I have lent it out to various people, some who admit to only occassionally reading! Everyone has been awe stuck by the story. Our debt of gratitude to those who fought the Second World War is aptly enhanced."
3,An okay movie but...,"This movie has great aerial combat scenes... However character development and acting are nowhere near as well done as in the 1995 HBO version ""The Tuskegee Airmen."" That movie can be had for under $5 here on Amazon and is well worth the price to round out this unique and fascinating story of these heroic airmen."
2,Not So Good,"Having seen The Tuskegee Airmen and being a huge Cuba Gooding fan, I was disappointed in this film. Cuba Gooding does not have a significant role in this movie, which was a letdown for me. The action scenes are good; the flight sequences and dogfight scenes are well choreographed and produced. The movie seems a remake of Tuskegee Airmen and definitely not an improvement. The plot is loose; there's not much of a build to any sort of climax and at the two-hour mark (approximately), the movie ends. The only wrap-up is a series of written FYIs exactly like Tuskegee Airmen.I might have enjoyed this movie more had I not seen Tuskegee Airmen before."
2,Red Tails,"Very poor acting, very disappointed as I love airplanes, retired from the US Air Force. I will probably try to resell it on ebay."
5,I enjoyed it in the theater so I got it to look at it again,"Considering how this movie has been treated, I would say there are still some clear issues (numbers don't lie: Just look at the distribution of ratings compared to other WWII movies on Imbd and it's better than some movies that rate better...).So, my full support to this effort. I was not aware of this until I saw the movie and the facts check so based on a true story of a battle on 2 front (Nazi and race).Some of it is a bit surreal (how the guys who don't like them, likes them quite fast). The German guy is a bit comical in a B-rated way, but the rest is quite appealing and I went to check the facts. Thumbs up for the effort.I got a great quote from the movie: ""The art of politics is to postpone an issue until it becomes irrelevant"".Boy, is that a bulls eye or what!"
3,"Not that great, but it was decent...","I went into this movie hoping that it would live up to the history and honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, but it was just an ok movie. The use of new actors was great in my opinion, and while the acting was brilliant, the script wasn't as fleshed out as it could've been leaving me wanting more. The parts of the bomber crews came off as robotic and predictable and the racism faced by the black crews didn't really feel as challenging as I'm sure the Tuskegee Airmen faced in real life.Now, I've always been one to read about the air and sea battles of WW2 and this movie didn't disappoint. Everything was in your face and was spectacular from beginning to end. I've heard this movie referred to ""Star Wars with planes"", and it was.This movie did definitely have it shortcomings, from the script to the editing, but if you just want to get an idea of the heroics of the Airmen, this is the movie to see."
5,Excellent,This is actually an EXCELLENT film!!! It is NOT a remake or anything along those lines. This is an original story with a good plot.
3,average movie,Not a lot of action as expected in a so callled great movie -parts were boring-I felt parts were a bit exagerated
2,Disappointing interpretation of history,"One star for special effects. One star for Terrence Howard and a good supporting cast of Americans of African descent. Watching Gooding was painful. He used to be a fine actor. Also, they should have hired a script writer. Most of the lines were trite, especially those of the white pilots. Great subject matter turned into a comic book, replete with obvious plot devices."
2,Red Tails,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. It had well known actors in the lead parts, which is one reason I bought the movie. All Cuba Gooding Jr., did was walk around with a pipe in his mouth. Terrence Howard wasn't much better.The movie was choppy and jumped around from one subject to another. I reccomend renting this movie before purchasing it to see how well you like it before adding it to your dvd collection."
3,Red Tails,"No bombers when down while The Red Tails protect them. If you watch old 12 O'Clock High television series, it is funny every episode the general has problem losing bombers and men."
2,big disappointment,i really wanted to like this movie.the trailer looked fantastic.but instead of focusing on the aerial exploits of these heroes the film gets bogged down with a love story between one of the main charactors and a local girl and his inability to follow orders.the special effects are good and the dogfights are good when they are there.
2,Unhappy,"I,m sorry to inform you that the blu-ray version has not been able to run,as you have sent the wrong area.You sent the same version that will only run on ""A"" REGION Blu-ray players. My player is obviously a ""B"" REGION player,I live in AUSTRALIA.Could you please rectify and send me a ""B"" REGION compatible disc. Third time lucky I hope."
3,Was hoping for more action scenes.,"The acting in this movie was fair, although a little too over dramatic to serve it's message.There were many more facets of the plot that were unfortunately left unexplored. The overall tone of the movie, was a very unflattering depiction of virtually all of the other armed service personnel as being openly racist, until later won by the integrity and valor of the core cast. It really was just one scene after another of how cruel, unsporting and how dismissive white people can be towards men of color.I admire the dignity and respect the plight of the men depicted in the film, of course. However, this is basically a film that flatly attempts to illustrate once again, that people of color will triumph simply because they are people of color."
5,Reality on the screen,I loved this film because it portrayed yet another division of the Tuskogee Airmen and this countries miscalculation due to racism on how good these flyers actually were. It could be empowering to young men and women to do their best and even if they are not recognized for a job well done to begin with; their time will come--they could be the very best and have high ranking persons name request them to do a job that will make everyone proud including the naysayers.
5,Wonderful Movie,"If you haven't seen this movie, you need to buy a copy. Sad things were like this back then, but glad they changed. This movie really illustrates the struggles and the victories of these men. Would like to say more... but you need to see it for yourself."
4,"There is always a time for history, it is never to late to learn.","A nice entertaining movie about flying with so good fight scenes. I think there should have been some more action, but in the long run it was a good movie."
3,Hollywood history,It was ok Hollywood version of history brought it for my husband who is retired air force who like me not that impressed with content would not recommend it must be better films about the red tails than this
3,not what i expected,"I thought it was more of a true story , it was based on events...I didn't like the acticing. but I can say it arrived on schedule and in good condition."
5,Red Tails with Cuba Gooding Jr.,"Excellent Movie Good for everybody, shows what really happened and the sacrifices that were made for this country to survive"
1,Disappointing,"i was VERY excited about this movie till i saw it. To be brief, it LOOKED good, SFX/CGI were top notch. HOWEVER, the acting was terrible, the plot was spoon fed to the viewer, they assume we are no longer capable of inferring things on our own. It was cliche and predictable, and it was technically incorrect!! in one scene (SPOILER STOP NOW!!!!) a character in a P-51 goes nose to nose with a German in an Me-262. he gets shot in the chest a few times and gets a two minute death scene. You don't GET a two minute death scene after you've taken several (let alone ONE) 20mm rounds in the chest. It was insulting. If I was the Tuskagee Airmen i'd be upset. They had a better 30 second spot in Hart's War. watch that instead....."
1,Pretty Bad...No Really Bad,"This movie was a drag..Terrible effects, terrible acting..not realistic at all..do not waste your time or money. Same ole story."
2,Had potential...,"Without being too wordy and too boring, ""Red Tails"" had the potential of being a very good movie. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" was much better. It tells the story without all the really dull moments and really boring dialog."
2,Should be fiction!,"I actually thought this would be factually accurate when i purchased it, however it appears to me that they are trying to re-write history quite a bit!"
1,Please help Cuba Gooding,"I remember the promotional tour for this film and thought it would be worth a view and I do have to say that it was excellent after the first half when I continued to watch through my eyelids. I have been a moderate fan of Cuba Gooding for a while but this performance would have been better and more believable had it been done by the pets.com sock puppet. Instead of a microphone, of course, the sock puppet would have to be holding a pipe! I'm not a pilot and flying Alaska Air still doesn't qualify me to comment on the aeronautics of the spectacle but the writing was horrible, the acting took place off set and the story was formulaic at best. Thank heavens I got it from the library, even then it cost me too much. I am still wondering how you get a cockpit full of fuel in a fighter and how you take cannon fire through the wings without igniting the fuel actually there in but hey, I fly Alaska Air....Sad, the whole thing looked like folks making house payments, not a movie."
2,Predictable and shallow..and you CAN'T RENT IT!,"As an aviation buff and military history's enthusiast, I hade great expectations for this film. While some of the flying sequences were interesting, they were pasted together with entirely predictable....and dare I say stereotypical, performances. Anyone who hasn't lived under a rock must appreciate the struggle minority soldiers, sailors and airmen endured to serve a country where they all to often were marginalized and unappreciated. However, the acting in this film fails to connect those facts at a gut level at least from my perspective. Much better in that respect can be found in a film such as ""Glory""...but of course just about anything with Morgan Freeman in the cast is pretty much a winner in my book. The bottom line is that if offered as a rental, it might be worth watching for the flying scenes. But as history, go read any of the first hand accounts form the original Red Tails themselves....you'll be better served!"
5,Red Tails,"My husband and I couldn't wait to see this movie, so with pop corn in hand and feet up we watched it and enjoyed it very much"
3,an entertaining movie for History Classes in High School....,Good Video....but far too predictable.....almost completely CGA....Very easy to figure out what the next scene will bring...I Love Aviation History...but this movie drags....
3,Could have been a great movie....,...but instead it was more of a standard action flick with excellent special effects. with all the great actors in the movie i expected a little more.
1,simply dreadful,"Red Tails was a completely terrible rendition of an overdone story. The script was horrible, which inevitibly caused the acting (with the exception of Cuba Gooding) to be just horrendous. Lucas should stick with Star Wars. Skip this movie."
2,Cartoonish,The only good thing of the movie are the computer animated graphics. Very annoyed with the depiction of serious and respected aviators as immature and peter pan mavericks.
1,An insult,"I am SO glad I didn't go to the theater and watch this piece of crap movie. What a slap in the face it is to not only the original Tuskegee Airmen who risked their lives fighting, but to the people of Alabama. The story line was impossible to follow. At no time did it give any of the history behind the ""experiment"" that was conducted. The dialogue was pathetic. The worst acting I've seen by Cuba and Terrence.George Lucas needs his butt kicked and this so called director would do better directing Sesame Street in Pakistan. The air scenes were good but that's about it. Keep your money in your pocket."
1,Propaganda film?,"I feel this film is doing an injustice and glorfying the wrong airmen. This film make you believe that they won the war, killed Hitler and defeated the Japanese; while other troopsstayed in the trenches and were to afraid to fight.This is nothing more than a propaganda film. Much likeHitler did to the German youths prior to declaring waron his own people. Don't fall for it."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!,Action sequences were fantastic BUT........the storyline and acting was just god awful! 10 minutes into the dialogue almostput me into a coma. I found myself not caring about any of these characters. Want to see a great film along the same lines?Do yourself a favor and see GLORY with Denzel Washington. Now THAT'S a great movie! The writers of Red Tails should take lessonson what makes a great character driven story.
1,what a waste of money,"true story ok, but the acting sucks there's only three actors Ivé ever seen before and both me and my wife fell to sleep after thirty minutes of watching the movie,later I tried watching again and once again fell asleep(don't buy untill you've rented first)just painfully boring."
5,RED TAIL HAWKS,This DVD met all my expectations. It was a great depiction of all the Tuskegee Airmen accomplished. It is really sad to think of all they accomplished only to come back home to country they left. It is only fiting that they are now getting the recogniti9on they deserved back then.
2,"Great Story, Lousy Movie","This is a great story, and could have been a riveting movie had the producers not opted to save money by hiring screenwriters from the 7th grade remedial writing class. Seriously, this is some of the worst, corniest dialog you will ever hear in a movie theater. I cringed every time someone opened their mouth. Only need to watch this one if you have a serious P51 thing."
4,Great WWII Movie!,"This is a great World War 2 movie that is a must see for any war film fans. The acting is good, not great and the script is cheesy at times, but overall a must see good movie."
3,Good but a little disappointed,This movie has a list of great actors in it so when I saw the previews I couldn't wait to see it because I just knew that it was going to be good. The acting was not that good and maybe it was the direction they received I don't know but I expected better from this group of actors. The subject line was great and inspiring but the acting did not do it jutice. it's one of those movies that I don't think that I'll watch again. If you have the option to rent I would definetly do that as oppose to purchasing this movie.
3,"Good action, bad acting","While some of the action and flying scenes were good, the acting was lousy.Many of the action/flying scenes looked like 1950's air war movies where you could notice the pilot was in a mock-up plane in front of a screen with the background being projected onto it, except in this case they were in front of a green screen. I also don't like it when a scene is used over and over again (as in some of the battle scenes) except they flipped the scene vertically or zoomed in on a smaller aspect of the same scene. In other words it looked fake.The non-action scenes of the movie were almost painful. I tend to blame it on the script because I've seen some of the actors in other things and I know they can act better than this. The story line was predictable. The lines and the characters were cliche. And the actors were wooden caricatures.Not worth the money IMHO."
4,Not to bad,I didn't think it was too bad I've enjoyed and would probably watch it again. I don't know that it's worth paying I see In theatre thoigj
2,Skip this one ...,"Skip this one. The plot was thin and trite; most everything was cliched. The only good thing about this movie - and you'd have to be a fan of WWII fighters to appreciate it - was seeing realistic CG renditions of classic Allied and Axis planes flying over the European theater. (The only reason I actually gave this movie a two-star review is because I DO happen to be enthralled with Second World War history, and period combat aircraft, in particular.) The aerial combat scenes were exciting, but almost comically blown out of proportion. Looked like Star Wars, with Messerschmitts instead of Tie fighters! Save your money for a better WWII air combat movie ... rent ""Midway"" or ""Memphis Belle"". Even the flying propaganda-poster movies of 1941-45 had better plot lines, and acting, than this movie (see The Flying Tigers or Flying Leathernecks). I can't exactly say that it did a disservice to the Tuskeegee airmen, but it certainly did not honor their memory, either."
1,Bad Movie about great airmen,"I am a big fan of the Tuskegee Airmen. They are heroes in my book, but this movie does not do them the excitement or heart throbbing action that they deserved. I found the movie very slow in many parts and the connection to the characters was distant. Maybe George Lucas needed Spielberg to tell their heroic efforts in a much better way. Movie only gets one star. These heroes deserve five stars."
2,Amazon Video Purchase,The video stopped playing and turned into a black screen twice while we were watching the video. It would be nice to get a refund. Thank you.
1,Don't waste your time/$$$,"Couldn't make it 30 mins into this movie. I've seen better acting and dialogue on MST3K. I had pretty high hopes going into it, too. Oh well."
1,Not good.,"Music was just bad, acting ok( seen better and seen worse ), and the writing not good, all the speeches just kinda dropped off leaving you hanging."
2,Tuskeegate history deserves better,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie and was really disappointed. I had such high hopes for this movie that the let down was partly because the movie was so poorly directed. I was most offended by the producer/director using 1940's jive talking and making these great air men look like idiots. If it hasn't had subtitles, it would have been difficult to understand the actors. I am white and I respect the Tuskeegee air men who finally had their chance to make a difference during World War II. I can't help but wonder how these good actors felt delivering these corny out dated lines; they must have been offended as well. The Tuskeegee air men were a credit to our country, their race, all their awards earned and they deserved to be recognized as the excellent air men that they were."
1,Terrible,"This movie is an insult to the brave men who really were Tuskegee Airmen.I couldn't get past the horrible acting and cheesy lines in the first two scenes. After watching Cuba Gooding Jr. in Men of Honor, this movie is revolting. And the CGI is so thick that I felt like I was playing an Xbox game instead of watching a movie. Horrendous.You want a great, new war movie? Go and rent ""My Way"". Comparing ""Red Tails"" with ""My Way"" is like comparing a broken bicycle to a showroom Ferrari."
3,Boring,It was okay but wasn't at all worth the hype. Wasn't really about the Tuskegee Airmen. More on one fictional mans personal life that had nothing to do with history. I think it was an attempt to be like Titanic and failed.
1,Red Tails,"Was a gift for my husband. Ordered a ""used DVD"" It was obviously a ""copy"" and not a very good one. Next time will spend the few extra dollars for a ""New"" DVD. Also with a new dvd ,should get a much better quality picture and extra production features. Will know better the next time ."
2,Not bad...mediocre,"While it's not a rehash of the Tuskegee airmen where Laurence Fishburne and ALSO Cuba Gooding Jr. act. It's not better than that.For the not famous portion of the cast the acting could have used some polishing because the capacity of the people involved is there, you just don't see them doing their best, except for maybe Ne-Yo as the comic relief.The dialog is clumsy and somewhat C movie quality as is specially noticeable in the first scene.Special effects are o.k. the top shots of the base leave something to be desired.All in all this movie requires two things to become actually good.1: Better direction and demand on its actors.2: Better edition."
1,Great story deserved a better movie,"The Tuskegee Airmen is one of the great inspirational stories of WWII. The fact that these men sacrificed a great deal and overcame much more is a story worth telling. Red Tails fails to do this in spectacular fashion. It's obvious they wanted to tell this story but were either too cheap or didn't have the respect to use the common names so we were stuck with Red Tails. The characters are stock movie fashion, the solemn leader, the hot shot, the joker and the rookie. It's obvious that no research was really done and the dialog is laughable at best.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. It does no credit to the story of the brave airmen and combines the worst quality of script and shooting. Don't waste your time here."
5,THE TRUTH,I thought the movie was great. Being an african-american man i feel we need more movies about our history. If more movies like this was shown to all people regardless of color maybe there wouldn't be so much racism today. And for those that didn't appreciate the movie probably never got over slavery ending. It was a GREAT MOVIE AND STOP THE HATE !!!!!!
4,Good Movie!,"The actors in ""Red Tail"" are phenomenal and, more importantly, this movie tells a story which has been ignored and left out of our history books. These african-american pilots and airmen had to fight every step of the way to be part of WWII. Their job was to protect the bombers from enemy fighter planes and in reality, they did an exceptional job, never leaving their bomber(s), protecting them every step of the way. There was plenty of action and also a good story line in the characters. Anyone would like this movie."
3,Pipe smoker nearly killed the movie for me,As an airplane buff and someone with deep respect for our veteran fighter pilots I looked forward to purchasing and viewing this film from Amazon. What got in the way of my total enjoyment was too many scenes with Cuba looking stupid with a pipe in his mouth. Otherwise a fine film.
3,lacks accuracy,"Good to see the historical inclusion of the Me262 jet fighter,however these planes were armed with four 30mm cannon and the bullet holes in the Mustangs are more like 10mm!! I would be good if film makers tried harder to get thing correct! I can not find any record of the jets being shot down in combat,except when they were at their most vunerable when landing"
4,Very interesting and entertaining,My other half is a history buff and really wanted to see this movie. We both enjoyed it. The story gave a great picture of the discrimination the pilots had to overcome and also of the issues they faced individually and as a squadron. I love stories of the underdog having to prove himself and coming out on top. Discrimination in any form is terrible. Overcoming it is awesome! Good movie!
3,"A little more ""Hollywood dazzle"" than I wanted","The story line is fine, but the acting and representation was a bit too Hollywood and hokey for me. I am aware that a lot of factual information was trying to be crammed into one movie, but the mediocre acting left me disappointed at the end of the film. The true characters were definitely heroes of WWII, but the way they were portrayed in this film had way too much Hollywood glitz added in. Very disappointed in how these true heroes were represented. I think most of them would have been grounded had they truly behaved like the ""hot dogs"" they were displayed as in this film. Bottom line: I would recommend NOT buying and save your $$ for more of a documentary-type film."
4,Good Movie,Good Movie & understand it is base on true events. Could have used more depth of characters without all the drama. A short background of each would have been nice. I brought it to present to my grandchildren. Also the documentary should have been tagged on for viewer's history.
5,germany lost because of the red tails,"when you give the under dog a fighting chance, sometimes it really pays off, as it did in this case.the airforce had the answer in there handys and didn't even know it."
4,"As expected, desired, lots of aerial action.","Action flick more than anything. Lots of aerial combat, special effects and all done well except now and again, faint hint of computer graphics but did not ruin action. Found perhaps a little too long and predictable plot and surprisingly, very little about Negro aviators. Oh, that aspect in film but to extent that it moved me or made me angry how we treated Negro in the day and still do, no, movie did not move me BUT as I said up front, action movie and a good one for that. Recommend when action is all you want."
5,Exciting historical fiction,"I was committed to buying this movie about the Tuskegee Airmen before I saw the movie, actually. I was not dissapointed. It was good historical fiction, action packed and entertaining. But when my 6 year old African American grandson was quoting lines from the movie and talking about being a pilot I really appreciated this movie more."
5,Red Tails,"This was a movie with lots of action, humor and a love interest. It also showed the respect and honor given to a class of men that has been long over due for their bravery and heroism."
3,Good idea but...,"The dog fighting scenes are great, but the acting is poor with the exception of Cuba Gooding Jr. And Terrence Howard. This could of been a great movie but I gotta say I wish I hadn't spent the money."
4,Red Tails,Shipping was efficient and fast. Movie was pretty good with lots of action. It followed the story line of the Tuskegee Airman. Not sure the German ACE that went up against them could have qualified for the 109s and 262s though.
4,Honorable!!!,This film is a fine tribute to those men who's actions made it possible to defeat a terrible power. The actors do a great job portrying their characters.Action scenes were realistic. A Good Flick.
2,Gigantic Disapointment,"These men braved enormous odds and overcame bigotry to serve. The movie Red Tails is a poor example of a movie telling a compelling story. The attention to effects, costumes, locations, and other technical aspects was very impressive. Basic characterization and other important plot elements were severely lacking. The actors tried their best, but simply could not overcome this anemic attempt at a movie. I was sitting in the theater thinking ""those great men deserved better than this."""
2,It's passes but barely,"This movie is ok but lacked in many ways as well. It failed to tell a great and true story in a great way, but it did succeed in remaining family friendly. I think that this story needs to be told in a more graphic and realistic manor than what was done in this film. This film had plenty of bad acting and is more deserving of a local TV special, not a hollywood film. That being said it is not terrible, just not all that great."
4,"It's Not ""Memphis Belle"" But...","...it's pretty good. I think it will pique peoples' interest in this arena of WW2. The acting was pretty good. Loved that they got that P-51 start up sound in there; nothing like a WW2 plane engine starting up!There was a little TOO much computer-generated images and not enough models or real planes and the difference is obvious but that's nit-picky. Aerial stuff was great although I questioned a few paint job inaccuracies on the B-17s and some uniform parts were slightly incorrect, I believe. Again nit-picking. Over all, technically a good period piece.I would definitely watch it again and wish that producers would quit gypping consumers off by not putting any of the cool extras in DVD versions too!"
1,Mr. Lucas' Opus Magnum,"Mr. Lucas' Opus Magnum it isn't. The last 2 decades have produced a lot ofmediocre WW2 movies. But most of them were low budget indie movies. Thereforeone did not expect too much.Well, Mr. Lucas managed to achieve an even lower quality by wasting a lot ofmoney. The acting (and uttering of the atrocious dialogue) could be done betterby any reenactment group. The arial compact scenes might look impressive at firstbut are absolutely unrealistic.And the story line is the WW2 equivalent of a cheap Italian softporn movie.Cutboard characters (bad white officers, good black soldiers, evil Nazi Germans),implausible events (shortest captivity ever, Pilot taking multiple 30mm roundsbefore dying, P51 being nearly as fast as the ME262 etc.).So, don't waste you hard earned cash on this abominal mess of a film.If the Topic suits you, see the original HBO film or Buffalo Soldiers 44.Both not perfect but worlds ahead of this lousy waste of resources."
3,"A Great Story, But Not a Great Movie","I wish this had been a better movie. The story needed to be told, and I'm glad it was, but great deeds deserve a great movie, and this just wasn't as memorable as it should have been. The basic facts about the Tuskegee Airmen are dramatic enough: they broke the color barrier in air combat, and earned the respect of the military and the nation. There just wasn't enough grit or enough depth to the characters portrayed in this film. I'm still glad I watched it, but it won't stay with me the way the great movies do. I have to confess, I did love the planes!"
3,Red Tails-A good show,"I enjoyed Red Tails mainly because it told a good story about mainly ignored Black pilots in WWII. As a former pilot, some of the in-flight activity was difficult to accept such as the excellent communications among pilots. However, it did make the film a lot more interesting."
4,RedTails 2012,"A very interesting story, but not told very well. Lots of action and suspense. This should be a better documentary of the famous Tusekegee Airmen, a story that should never fade."
1,Disappointed BIG time,"Very disappointed with this movie. After waiting weeks and weeks thinking it would be a quality movie about some great hero's of WW II; I watched maybe 50% before giving up on it. Not a good representation of these brave men who were the Red Tail fliers. Very poor acting, missing information on the actual individuals who performed a great service to our country and other fliers. I can't understand how it could have been so highly recommended by others for there is no way would I recommend it to any one!"
5,Awesome Movie,This is one of the best films I have seen in years. Awesome graphics as well as dogfight scenes. I can't wait to see another movie like this one.
1,Garbage!,"Worst film ever....EVER!Don't waste your time watching, buying, previewing or even talk about this mess!Its a terrible from start to finish!"
4,Red Tails,"Not as good as the first one ""Tusgeegee airmen"" but good. And it is about time that people of Color are finally recognized for there heroic actions!!."
5,Red Tails,This is an awesome movie about Black History of Pilots during WWII. The story line is great and of course there has to be some romance. Loved this Movie. Wish they would make one of the Buffalo Soldiers (Army) like they did Red Tails (Air Force)
5,great movie,anyone who is a fan of the tuskeege airmen and have the HBO movie as well i reccomend this movie
3,It's just an OK movie,"We love movies about aviation and liked the movie ""Tuskeegee Airmen"" but this did not measurte up to our expectations."
5,Loved this movie.,"Wonderful story honoring the members of the Red Tails and the sacrifice they made to the war effort. In spite of the attitudes of the day the Tuskegee Airmen showed the world that we are all equal in Service, Honor & Duty. Thank you for your sacrifice."
5,An awesome book.........not just for kids!,"My mother gave me this book when I was younger, it was her's as a child. I've read these stories over and over, loving them even more as I read. Unfortuneatly, I've lost my copy, but I can recall all of the stories in my head. I love this book and would defenitly reccommend it."
4,"KOL 12"" Dance Versions Hits of 80s","This a great collection of rare 80""s dance remixes in one very well recorded anthology. I only wish that there were a lot more recordings such as this one. The first and tenth cuts are worth buying this CD for!"
3,Afterglow Review,"I, too, am a bit disappointed in the songs included in the CD. I rarely look for music, but totally enjoyed one of the songs in the movie. Very deep husky voice and wanted to find that title on the CD - No luck and quite disappointed. Can you help me find the complete Afterglow CD???Thanks."
1,Do not buy this CD if..............,"..........you expect it to be comprised of the wonderful mixed-bag of soulful souds heard in the movie. I rented the movie, fell in love with it, as wel as the soundtrack, rushed out to buy the cd, and I will be returning it tomorrow! In and of itself it is not a bad cd, but if you rush out to buy it based on what you heard in the movie, you too may be forced to return it."
1,dissapointed,"it does not include all the soundtrack. specifically,it does not include Tom Waits singing of ""Somewhere"",which was the main reason I wanted the album.tom waits singing ""somewhere"" can be found at CDUNIVERSE.COMlook for the album ""blue valentine"". a great find!!"
2,The foreign singer is...,"Gilbert Becaud. At least, I think that's who it is. He, of course, is a French singer and some of his work was produced by JC Vannier who co-produced and scored ""L'Histoire de Melody Nelson"" by Serge Gainsbourg.Meanwhile, can ANYONE please tell me where the songs by Mr. Becaud from this movie can be found? I'm eager to locate them."
3,El rey Arturo y Los Caballeros,"Es sencillo de leer, y vale la pena pues no se enfoca a una sola historia, sino a varias derivadas de la misma leyenda, permitiendo xconocer de manera amena y rapida, varias vertientes de esta saga del Rey Arturo."
1,"I See The Vixens, Where Are The Vampires?","I picked up this movie from Amazon a while ago. I was in the mood to see what b movie actress Michelle Bauer had been up to. Unfortunately I picked this thing up.The basic story goes...there are these aliens that have come to earth to harvest a drug that is illegal in space as well. Human males produce this stuff at the height of extacsy, at which time the aliens (beautifully portrayed by three vixens one being JJ North) suck this stuff out of the men leaving them like raisins.Some funny moments in this movie but the detective's slapstick and stupid humour really made this movie stink. Michelle Bauer isn't the star I thought she was in this movie, but she does have an okay role as well.This is a campy teen T & A movie with a very annoying detective in it."
4,Vampire Vixens From Venus,Adult Sci-Fi that captures the 80's style of film with low budget acting. Still a fun movie for those who like campy adult films with humor & Special effects plus sexy women.
3,"good songs, toothless production","this is not the best release from the mc5 to start with, and even after you get the buzz, its not all that great. as most of the other reviews mention, the production is ultra clean, virtually bass-less, and it certainly hurts some of the more rocking songs, notable looking at you. the covers and let me try should've been left off, and the more teen oriented songs (high school, tonight, teenage lust) are simply not that convincing, considering the material on their previous release, the awesome kick out the jams. the heart of the album lies in the trio of american ruse, shakin street, & the human being lawnmower. shakin street is not the best song to typify the 5, but it is one of the true classics of rock and roll. final analysis: borrow it first."
2,One of the most overrated albums of all time?,"I really don't get why this album gets so much praise. The songs are kinda weak, the production lousy and there is no punch whatsoever. I've tried many times to let this album grow on me but it just won't happen.I love the Stooges, the Dolls, Ramones etc. etc. etc., but this I don't get. And if you're looking for classic punk, I'd say look somewhere else. This is just old time rock 'n' roll performed pretty poorly. Look at what Alice Cooper did at the time - way more punk, way more interesting, and way higher quality than this.The reason I give this two stars and not one is that The Human Being Lawnmower is actually a cool song. The rest I could do without.My opinion of course."
3,Not the MC5 Sound,"The MC5 was known for their huge sound...well it ain't here. It's a treble sound and most of the music sounds like really weak little Richard/Jerry Lewis songs. The first time I heard Kick Out the Jams it was like a punch to the face. A long time Michigan rocker that owned a record store and had also spent his formitive years listening to The Stooges and MC5 pointed me to Power Trip. It was so raw and insane that I couldn't believe that this band was better known. Well this album kind of brings the band back down to earth for me. Human Lawn Mower is good, and Looking At You is pure punk rock. Therefore I give it 3 stars."
3,Where's the dynamite?,"I finally got my hands on this disc and it's really pretty tame, which is not what I expected from the MC5. A lot of the problem is the tinny, bottomless production, 'cause ""The American Ruse"" smokes, in spite of the lame sound; but there are some tracks like ""High School"" and their plain 'n' simple, note-for-note cover of Chuck Berry's ""Back in the USA"" that really fall flat. And I don't care how diehard you are, there's no forgiving ""High School,"" it's like the theme song to a Saturday Afternoon Special (""Siss-boom-bah""?! C'mon Tyner, who paid you to sing that?). Otherwise, really a trip to hear how they followed up ""Kick Out the Jams,"" and just for the history lesson this disc is worth the cash. Mighty they'll forever stand. On a related note, buy everything you can find by Sonic's Rendezvous Band; Fred Sonic Smith's late '70s band is godlike. . . ."
5,Back to the basics,"One listen and it sure doesn't sound like the MC5 of Kick Out The Jams. If that is what you expect to hear, you'll be disappointed. The MC5 get back to basics here by playing stripped-down rock & roll. The sound of the record is also thin. There is great material here such as ""Shakin' Street"" featuring Fred ""Sonic"" Smith on vocals. The song is a classic rock & roll narrative complete with characters like Streetlight Sam, Skinny Leg Pete, and Sally Baker. ""Looking At You"" features an awesome guitar solo by Wayne Kramer. For the most part, Back In The USA finds the MC5 dispensing of the radical politics of their first album and replacing it with basic themes such as ""Teenage Lust"" and about the kids just wanting to have some fun in ""High School"". The album is bookended by two rock & roll covers ""Tutti Frutti"" by Little Richard and ""Back In The USA"" by Chuck Berry."
1,MC5 Let Down,"Kick Out The Jams and Starship are great albums. I love MC5, but this record is truely terrible. It sounds like watered down American Bandstand. I replayed it twice thinking, ""this can't be the same group???"" The only time that this album should be played is to end hostage situations."
1,not the mc5 i like.,"if you like kick out the jams like i do, youll hate this. its a waste of plastic."
3,disappointing follow-up to Kick Out the Jams,"I listened to it once or twice, and I don't want to hear it again. Only a few good songs. Don't waste your money, unless just to complete your collection. The American Ruse is much better versions of some of the same songs in my opinion (I prefer the rawer sound).[2011 edit] man, I forgot about this old review. I bumped up the review one star. Remove the covers on the album, and the rest of their stuff is pretty good."
2,Oh dear...,"Oh my god, what happened? The MC5 of ""Back In The USA"" is a completely different creature from the MC5 of ""Kick Out The Jams"". For a start, they dropped the strung-out KOTJ political philosophy, such as it was, (good thing...) but rather like Samson shorn of his tresses, MC5 sans goofy politics seemed to lose their energy and songwriting ability. And as for the production? It doesn't even bear writing about....Strictly for the completist..."
3,A good album from an obscure band,"""Back in the USA"" from 1970 is in my opinion the best of MC 5's three albums. The band have achieved a bit of cult status (Lemmy from Motorhead keep on praising this gang and both the singer Rob Tyner and one of the guitar players are now dead). Even 'tho I can't say that MC 5 are the best band in the world, they sure deliver rock full of groove. With songs like the captivating ""Tonight"" with its hit potential, the punk rock-melodic ""Teenage lust"", the 1960's pop influenced ""High school"", the rock 'n' roll dance number ""The American ruse"" and of course the harder drum driven ""Call me animal"" this is an album you should have in your collection. It's just too bad that the production is so light and there is too much treble. Anyway, do yourself a favour and get ""Back in the USA""."
5,Roommate Survival Kit,"Rules for Roommates was a lifesaver to me. I live with 5 other women and this book made me realize that I am not the only person to deal with rotten roommates. Rules for Roommates also helped me find humor in many things that happened in my house. Through the many stories and antedotes in the book, I discovered new and origional ways to handle roommate situations. I definitely reccommend this book to everyone."
5,Rules for Roomates,"Everyone who has ever had a roomate (and that's everyone!)will get a charge out of this book! You'll either recognize roomates you've had -- or maybe even recognize yourself! It's funny, it's witty, it's wise. Most of all, it's perfect for anyone you know who is about to begin the life experience of sharing a space with someone else. Even though it's written for same-sex roomates, couples newly living together would do well to check it out -- they could discover things they do that drive their mate mad, as well! Perfect gift for someone going away to college or entering the work world after graduation -- anyone who is about to begin sharing space with a roomate for the first time."
3,No surprises,"The ending was obvious with few surprises. The only unknows was that John was in rehab. Not great, but okay"
5,Nice Book,"I really, really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest throughout. Although, I agree with one reviewer about some typos, they really didn't detract from the good story telling. I will definitely read another by this author."
3,an enjoyable author,"I got this book because I enjoyed 'Our Husband' so much. I enjoyed this too. Yes there are typos, but I did not find them so distracting to have reread sentences repeatedly. There were some plot points disagreed with. I thought another choice would have been stronger, but worked. Enjoyable afternoon's pastime while kids played."
5,So Cute,"I think Stephanie Bond is one of my favorite Authors. Her books are not expensive and are on the free list quite a bit, which I love. I like her characters and story lines. She is surely one of my favorite Humorous Romantic Genre Authors."
4,fun,Stephanie Bond is a fun read. A quick and easy book to get into. I have liked every book I have read of hers.
4,Interesting! Funny!,Interesting! Funny! Well-written!Surprised to see a serious subject such as murder treated so well as a comedy. Would recommend to friends as entertaining.
2,Fair but predictable,"It was mildly entertaining but too predictable. I'm glad it was free on Kindle because I would have hated to spend money on it. Sorry, but that's how I feel."
4,A long time coming,Mason was a little slow but came around and stake his claim like he should have done. The family is a trip.
5,Cultural Adventure,I can't stop listening to this CD! It is like an adventure for your mind - each track takes me to another land &I feel like I can drift thru a culture in a mini epic movie.I have played this for all sorts of people and everyone enjoys its energy. Great for parites - great for chilling
1,Not Useful,I found this book to be rather preachy and it offered nothing helpful with regards to hiking the trail.
5,Should be on everyone's reading list,"Jay began his journey with the difficulty of a forced career change along with a genetic disease that can devastate even the best of people if they allow it. His positive attitude is reflected by his inspirational writings that help us all to deal with both our real and unreal problems. Jay has a way of finding the words to inspire us to take charge of our lives and continue our walk on life's journey. Jay has written reflections of the trail in his book, inspiring us all to meet the challenges of life head on and to learn from the tough times. ""A Time to Walk..."" should be on everyone's reading list."
3,Not realy a book about the AT,"This is a Very short book...a one afternooner at the most! But I'm realy not sure why he makes it sound like its a book about the AT. Its about his personal trials and hardships! he does give hope to those looking for inspiration! But for the reader whos looking for a good book about the AT, or about hiking in general... this book is not the one your looking for. If your looking for some good light reading about life, then by all meens Buy this book!"
1,Not Recommended,"I've read nearly every book out there on the AT hoping to one day do a thru-hike. Maybe if this was the first one I picked up I'd give it a better rating. However, this was the ONLY AT book that I didn't finish. I'll wade through Jay's ""Life Lessons"" eventually but I don't think they are all that monumental. There are a lot better books out there to choose from...skip this one."
2,Hiking advice lite,"This is a lite-weight book containing lite-weight advice. In fact, it's barely a book at all, since the font is huge and on most pages the text ends way before the page does. Nevertheless, this book reflects the high character and admirable spirit of the author, Jay Platt, who hiked the entire AT with a debilitating disease. My hat is off to him. Although I didn't think much of his book, by the end of it I liked the author very much. He strikes me as a straight-forward, honest, and kind man. His book is intended as advice for life (""life lessons""). If you would benefit from learning that life is like a hiking trail (sometimes it goes up, and sometimes it goes down), then this is the book for you. But since I had already figured out that life has some ups and downs, and that attitude can be quite important, reading the book was for me, a down."
5,"As Inspirational as ""Jonathon Livingston Seagull""!","This book is truly about the obstacles we face in life and how we overcome them through our personal attitude, philosophy toward life, and sometimes purely ""gutting-it-out"" determination. I haven't felt this way about a book since reading ""Jonathon Livingston Seagull"" by Richard Bach when I was a teenager. These two books will sit side-by-side on my personal bookshelf. Mr. Platt's book leaves one with a resonating, uplifted feeling toward life. All I have to do is look at his book and feel better about whatever life is sending my way. If I need further motivation, I just read it again!!!!"
1,NOT really an AT book,"If you are looking for a book about the AT, this is definitely not it. There are a few references to hiking the AT, but the life lessons are very general and could be taken from many other adventures in life."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I just finished ""A Time to Walk..."" I couldn't put it down. Patch sure had quite an adventure on the AT and learned a lot about life too. Excellent book."
4,A Lover's True Affair,"This American turned Parisian writes with affection, insight and wit of a peculiarly wonderful place and the times in which she has lived there and merged with both. Marvelously written pieces by the author of the wonderful and lamentably out of print 'biography' of the Riviera. One only wishes (thus the four stars) that the book were longer!"
3,Almost good...,"As a 50 year old with a newly found love of Paris and, as a result, a desire to learn French, I bought ""A French Affair"" because it was recommended as shedding light on what makes the French act, uh, French. If this is the point of the book, then it only partially achieves the goal. A great deal of the book, however, is given to anecdotes about French film makers. Very nice if that's what you're interested in. If your interests are similar to mine, understanding the French, I'd come back to this book later. That being said, some of the articles were very good indeed."
5,4 thumbs up,I wish I had this book in the beginning. I could just about cry when I realize all of the pains learning i went through trial and error. This book is right on to the point about handling cows.A+++++++++++++++++++
4,Helpful hints for an Aussie girl,"even though this book is written for the American farmer, I found a lot of the information quite helpful to me. I have not been farming very long. We work with beef cattle on grass and it has been a steep learning curve for us. Thank you for such well articulated good sense. I have taken initiatives that I thought were sensible and this book has either confirmed my ideas or given me a better way to approach the situation. I have also appreciated the statistical information given about the cattle. Thank you and God bless"
2,They ran out in one day!!,"I have owned this set of markers in the past and LOVED them. I used them for years without a problem so I was very excited to get a new set. After not even an hour, three of the blues dried out completely, and many of the other colors arrived a little ""dry"". I'm very disappointed and plan to send them back and order a duplicate. I hope the new ones are better."
2,Hmm,"If you want bold marks around a drawing, then go for it. Blending - no. Tints and shadows - no. Cheap markers for experimenting on finding markers. That's about it. Not for serious artist or draftsman."
2,So Disappointed,I've had a set of these markers for years. My children have been using them and slowing they were drying up so I started looking for the same set.I purchased this set off of Amazon. First off the case started cracking the first week! The markers kept falling out of the bottom and I couldn't understand why. It is flimsyand it has all cracked.Next my son comes to me with Orange marker all over his hands. The top of the lid and the bottom were leaking so profusely it was everywhere. I was so surprisedat the low quality of these markers.The other colors are fine thus far but it has only been 2 weeks so who knows.
2,Bad Pens & Bad Service,"I have purchased several brands of markers including Staedtler, OfficeMax metallic, TUL ultra fine, Bic Mark it fine point, and the Pentel Color Pen Set. Of all these brands I've used, & I have used them a lot, the Pentel brand is the worse one of the lot. When I contacted the Pentel company via their online web site to ask how I can return the whole set, since they are guaranteed, there was no response whatsoever. On the other hand, I returned one of the Bic Mark it pens for replacement & I not only received my new pen in short order they also threw in several $1 off coupons for future Bic purchases! Now, I ask, who would you do business with in the future? It's a no brainer."
5,Love pentel,"I have had these for about a month, and I love, love, love these markers. I originally just bought these for coloring in a design book, but instead I use them to draw designs and they have 36 good colors that I can choose from. All of the colors match the plastic outside, but 2 are a shade off, but all of you people getting mad about this, no color of ink can be the same as the plastic, because the plastic hardens and will either stay the same or get lighter, so back off the Pentel people. I still give these markers a 5 star, because they are epic!!!"
3,Expected better quality for the hype.,"I bought one of these for my kids this past Christmas and got complemented on the style and versatility. The top front surface did not line up well with the bottom layer but was subtle enough for us (it stuck our almost an inch on the front corners) when you just want to play with it, it was overlooked. And yes, these are made in China according to the Mountain Boy website. We changed it from sled to wagon about four times in three months due to the changing conditions in the high mountains of New Mexico where we live. In that time the wagon was kept outside only semi sheltered. It also started splitting in two locations (one place on a glue seam and another on the grain of the wood). I'm starting to wonder if I paid too much for this toy."
1,unsatisfied,I was very unhappy when I opened the box and saw this product had been made in China. It said in the review it was made in Colorado. I was even more upset when I pulled out the sled and the wheels and handle were not in the box. I did like the way the sled looked and would have kept it if all the parts were included. My whole purpose of buying this product was so my son could pull my daughter down the isle in a wagon on my wedding day. Without wheels I had no wagon. Needless to say this item went right back for return.
3,I agree on CHINA quality,"YES, this is over-priced china crap----YES, it ""looks good"" , but the quality s*cks.... I purchased from another retailer YES, it smells bad, got to leave it outside for awhile. Mine came with gouges in the wood in several places--front wheels slant pretty bad--It's NOT the heir loom piece it looks to be. Haven't had it in ""sled-mode"" yet, but I can tell by the look of the wooden adapters, it'll split in no time..... Go look @ their site..it goes for over $200 ?? I DON'T THINK SO !! I paid under a C-note, and still feel I was ripped~off ** save your $$ and keep looking **"
3,Not the quality I expected,"First - this is Made in ChinaSecond, the hand rails are quite loose. And it came with the Mountain Boy stamp faded."
5,For Walt Disney fans,"This is a wonderful book. Easy and enjoyable to read. The quotes bring you closer to understanding one of the true geniuses in American entertainment.The quotes are facinating, and humorous, and some are quite profound. This is a great book for any writer, or speaker to draw from, and it is historically educational.If you are a fan of Disney, or just curious about a figure in the world of entertainment who achieved greatness and had a solid philosophy of entertainment, then you will enjoy this book."
3,"Just the quotes, man....","Well, as far as quote books go, this is nice to have around the house. Interesting? Yes. Mind shattering or Amazing??? No. At around 10 bucks it's definitely worth the look-through and a cute & fun gift-y thing for your Disneyphile. =) We got this book one weekend and had fun looking through it while waiting in the ride queues. It's also an easy read for the car. You might actually pick up something new.. but not too much you haven't heard before, (assuming YOU are the Disenyphile)."
2,Mostly a book for patent lawyers...,"This is a history book which looks at the validity of Bessemer's patents on the Bessemer process of making steel, and covers the other individuals who lay claim to invention of the same process. Very light on how the Bessemer process works, and does not cover any other steelmaking processes. Lots of legal, little on technology. I skimmed the entire book, as technology was my interest. Probably a good source if you are interested in the patent issues."
3,Not as bad as it could have been!,"The Bottom Line:One of those idiotic movies in which all the plot strands would be resolved if the principal characters said one complete sentence without being interrupted/misunderstood, Three to Tango doesn't get points for screenwriting (especially in a late scene where Matthew Perry makes a big confession and gets a slow round of applause) but Neve Campbell--back when people still knew who she was--is luminous and many of the individual snippets of dialog are quite amusing; it's disposable, but not outright offensive in its trashiness.2.5/4"
2,a formulaic and messy menage,"The only person in the movie that you can come to care about is Matthew Perry. It's a real stretch to understand why he comes to love Neve Campbell. She plays a ditsy, messed up artist who swims in life's shallows. The Dylan McDermott character is so one dimensional he's virtually transparent.The movie has some juice while Perry is stuck in the ""gay"" mode. Once he comes out as straight everything deflates and becomes utterly predictable.Has anyone ever seen Matthew Perry in a romantic lead where there is even the slightest chemistry? He's charming, engaging and a bit charismatic but he seems to be phoning in the passion."
2,Friends castmemeber film formula # whatever,"This is lightweight stuff. Matthew Perry plays the lead here the same way he does Chandler on friends, guess that's what he does. Likable enough. Neve Campbell's very cute. It's actually a competantly executed movie, I didn't hate it. But I felt like I'd seen it many times before. It's a genre film all the way. Wasn't Jennifer Anniston in a (slightly, cautiously), ... freindly movie a few years ago? Couldn't possibly recomend this to anyone."
4,Wonderful Movie!,"I saw a sneak showing of it at Clemson Univ and it was absolutely hillarious. Sadly, I never saw it showing at the theater, but I would have gladly gone to see it again."
4,Tango with romance and fun!,"I love this movie -- the chemistry between Perry and Campbell is funny and quite touching. This is one of the most charming romantic comedies I have seen recently and I especially love Perry's comic charisma and ability to steal the spotlight. He is very attractive and funny.There is something problematic in this film: the stereotyping of gay people. I'm sure homosexuals are not very pleased with this film -- although to be honest, the movie wouldn't be as funny without the stereotypes. There were many hilarious scenes. The most memorable one was when the newspapers publicized Oscar's (mistaken) homosexuality.Oliver Platts was great, but Dylan McDermott's role of the Trump-like boss was dull and trite. Perry and Campbell make the film work, especially Perry."
3,A good movie despite its themes.,"This movie was very entertaining. The charade of Perry pretending to be gay to win a construction contract provides many humorous situations and I kept wanting Neve Cambell to find out the truth. Perry is great in the movie and combined with Cambell they make a great pair. McDermott is kind of wasted in his roll. He is there just to set up Perry and Cambell.The gay theme of this movie might be objectionable to some people. The movie tries to put the shoe on the other foot by making a straight man see the world through the eyes of a gay person. The movie does this well and uses the scenario for some great comedy.Now, I am a person who thinks homosexuality is wrong and believe there is no gray area on the issue. Still, I was able to overlook my beliefs to enjoy the movie for what it was. Anyone with my beliefs should enjoy this movie as well."
3,It's good and very.......different.,"I saw this movie exactly one year ago on T.V. and I really thought it was interesting and very different. The first gay movie I've seen. I found it hilarious and at the same time suspensefull, because you will not know in what will end. The truth is that I liked it, I confess. If you like different romantic movies, you'll enhoy this one. I hate romantic movies but with some comedy it makes itself watchfull and interesting. Watch it. You'll enjoy it."
3,"Good, but somewhat of a letdown","After a long wait for this second ""praise"" disc, I was disappointed to find that Petra took the safe route this time. ""The Rock Cries Out"" was a stellar effort not only because of its uplifting message and great singing, but especially due to its arrangement variety. This disc offers a good selection of praise tunes, and I enjoyed it, but I give it a ""D"" for innovation and variety. If I hadn't known better, I would have had trouble distinguishing this album from many of Petra's other releases, while ""The Rock Cries Out"" clearly stood out as a true ""praise project""."
1,Maximum Springsteen,"This is misleading. The description and ""track listing"" makes this sound like a CD of previously unreleased songs. Read it carefully. It is a ""bio""--basically some British guy talking about Bruce. Don't bother"
4,A great baseball story,"I thought I had pretty much heard all there was to hear about Joe, but I was way wrong. This book never got old because while Joe stated the obvious, he also took care to let us in on other things that happened at the same time. Everyone knows that Joe gave up his high school elgibility to sign with the Reds at the age of 14, but how many know that he later successfully petitioned to have his elgibility returned? That he was an all around athlete at Hamilton High? That he had a sister who died as a toddler? I didn't, but now I do. The minor league stories were the highlight of the book for me, but this is a recommended read for anyone who ever tuned into a Reds game on 700 WLW during one of the stretches where Joe had decided to punctuate the action with a long moment of silence, (Do I have this tuned right, or what?) or tried to figure out what was going on when the action was coming fast. You had to grow up with it to really appreciate it. Great book."
5,Erskineville Memoirs,"These guys rock. Best appreciated with a schooner of New on a hot Sunday arvo at the Sandringham hotel. Failing that, there's always the CDs."
5,I was able to pay for this book with the gold I found!,"I signed in and read the latest revue from the guy saying he bought the book and had a Mac and no IBM to view it with. He should have read the item description and cover carefully, becuz it said right on it that it was IBM version only! Maybe the gold fever got to him. It certainly got to me...but I was able to think afterwards. I found a few nuggets at Palmer Kanasket State Park this Saturday (December 28) using the gold pan my wife got me for Chrismas and this field guide. I'm hooked and goin out next weekend and every weekend til it's all mine!This guy s book reads easily and I took it out from my printer and got it all dirty, then threw it out later. I printed a fresh copy from my printer when I got home. How many books can you do that with....even automotive books?I give it 10 stars cuz it was so good. I highly recommend it."
5,Gone gold hunting,I got this e-book at Chrismas and popped it into my computer. It was a short book but simple to read. Am going out to find some nuggets this weekend. The writer said to wear safety gear near a river. Not a bad idea considering the rain we have been gettting lately. The word is they are finding nose picking size nuggets near Skykomish and Gold Bar areas. I am on my way to get it all before the next guys do.
1,Ignore rating,Make sure you have a PC and not a Mac as this can't be viewed on a Mac though this isn't indicated anywhere.
1,Not C++ and not optimizing C++,"This book is a collection of specific techniques, such as algorithms for sorting and data compression. Unless you have a very specialist need, these techniques are unlikely to be useful - these things are carried out by 3rd party products or using simpler, but perfectly adequate methods in most applications.The author also seems to demonstrate either an alarming lack of knowledge of C++ or the code within is the subject of a very basic C to C++ conversion. Basic errors abound, lack of variable initialisation is everywhere, C features are used where better C++ features exist.Additionally, the code typesetting is poor, indentation varies wildly from place to place.Not recommended, because i) the title is misleading and ii) the code within is very poor C++.Try Scott Meyers Effective C++ and More Effective C++ or Large Scale C++ Software Design by John Lakos instead."
3,Misleading C++,"Cons: As the guys have already mentioned this book has virtually (: nothing to do with C++ - specific optimization. Using the ""class"" keyword in the book a couple of times hardly justifies the title. What especially pisses me off is the ""Based on the new ANSI Standard C++"" quote on the cover. The poorly-formatted code which takes up 1/2 the book is really annoying, too. Pros: But aside that the book presents a bunch of useful specific techniques which are rarely covered in other books. If you find a place for these techniques in your code the book may be a life-saver. Source is included on disk. Overall: I would not reccomend buying the book before finding out whether the included material is relevant. For a good C++ - specific performance-issue book see Efficient C++ by Dov Bulka. It covers inheritance, inlining, templates, temporaries - REAL C++ issues, and I found it quite readable. max khesin."
1,"Should be Optimizing C, not C++","I think the book illustrated some useful implementations of speedy algorithms, but it is in no way is related to C++. When you see fopen, malloc, and free being used in every program, that should tell you something about how much useful C++ is contained within. I was disappointed with what I read within for the most part. The timings in the first chapter were performed on a 33 MHz i386, come on. That machine is ancient and does not represent any of some of the greatest computational architectural advances of all time. If you want to learn in limited scope, specific case speedups to C code, this book is for you. It is not for me."
4,exelent for you out there who like to boogie the night away,This is a fantastic album for those who like the old time rock and roll favorites. The only bad bit is when you just get in to the swing of things the song changes. However it is s happy boppy lively cd for parties to get the mood happening
1,half witticisms from Donald Trump,"He's big. He's arrogant. He's completely worthless as a human being, social force and as a source of knowledge. His casinos are ugly, and a drain on any local ecomony he infiltrates. He has no sense of style. He's only important because he has money, which has has tapped compulsive mentally ill gamblers to provide him. a sociopathic bottom feeder."
3,head to head,"Good stuff here, and good to see that Dixieland musicians (Allred) can cook too. A rating of 3 stars isn't bad, I reserve 5 stars for Frank Rosolino and Carl Fontana, 1 through 3 reserved for mortals."
2,I purchased A Product From Inuit Software and Scanning,"I purchased the software at Stapples (Hamilton Ontario) the software with the cashbox and scanning software for barcodes came to $4,000.00 now I did not know that the suport was for 30 days and that after that I would have to pay over $130.00 per moth (yes I did get a credit for $800.00 not in cheque) but for technical support and after those $800.00 are over my staff told me that we have to pay for it (I was amazed) that a product that cost over $4,000.00 does not even have more extended technical support, correct me if I am wrong but when you purchase a computer and some computers are dirt cheap lets say $1,500.00 you would get technical support for a year or sometimes more. I am not impressed at all with there so called ""customer service"" I am in the process of opening more stores and I will go look at other providers for software and scanning bar code mechanism."
3,Quickbooks,"While Quickbooks is a great product for writing checks, we have had nothing but trouble with the Do It Yourself Payroll. We have it on two computers and recently downloaded an update and ended up with a virus that knocked out our network for three days! In spite of our antivirus program. The customer support is terrible. Get this product for check writing and invoices but stay away from the payroll products!"
1,Used to be good but now...,"If you have an older version of this software I would stick with it. I wish I could go back every time I use this new one, but it's too late for me. The ""improvements"" are minimal and mostly useless and there are lots of ""unimprovements"", which they tend to do every time they upgrade.If you do not use Quickbooks and are a potential first time customer, go elsewhere. Research other software, like M.Y.O.B. or others. I'm not endorsing MYOB - I have never used it. It's just another similiar product to look into. [In my opinion] Intuit has ruined Quickbooks and [I feel] their tech support and customer support are the worst in the industry.Be warned!"
3,Dont buy this if you have NT and IE 5 or better,"The product is good, no doubt. The support that comes with it is poor.With 2002 and NT workstation you need to have only Internet Explorer 4(IE4), because the install of IE5 puts in files that are incompatible with the QB2002 program.It took 3 hours to install the program with research on the internet and on quickbooks site. If this is the version for 2002 why are they still using files from the browser install from 1999?(IE4).The phone in tech support does not even include install help for the program when you first buy it. Good luck with it."
1,The Money Pit,Intuit sees selling software as the first set in their revenue stream. When you buy the software you become hostage to Intuit's very manipulative marketing and seemingly endless offers and services. Many of the features you buy with the software only operate with a monthly subscription. The 2002 release is buggy but you get no help from the very pricey tech support without a credit card! Don't help this corporation remain the biggest player in the Small business accounting market. Intuit makes Microsoft seem like a public charity.
2,Quickbooks Pro,"I purchased Quickbooks in 1995 and subsequently upgraded to the Pro 5.0 version over a few years. I enjoyed the program and touted it's benfits. I upgraded again last summer to Quickbooks Pro 2001 for no other reason than to keep up to date. Recently when ordering the new tax table updates, we were informed that they were no longer available for the previous modest cost and that we had to subscribe to automatic updates for a fee....I am very displeased and can no longer recommend this program."
2,Hu hu hu!,I miss my quickbooks version 6.0 ...This 2002 upgrade is a letdown. There is almost no difference. I would hang on to the older versions if I were you. Unless you have money to burn.
1,Very Old Book,"This Elibron Classics book is a facsimile reprint of a 1892 edition by Whittaker and Co., LondonThis book is out of copyright. You can download a pdf of it for free at google books."
3,Different sheets than shown,"I ordered this for my daighter who is turning 2. I searched every site and this was the cutest for the best price. I was dissapointed however when I received it and the sheet set was not the flowers as shown in the photos, but a bright purple plaid that does not match the bedspread."
5,Cute bedding!,"I spent hours surfing the internet looking for the ""perfect"" bedding for my daughter. She's turning one and it was time to get rid of the ""baby look"". This is so cute and not babyish. I love the colors! I can't wait to redecorate her room!!"
4,Great Story,"I liked the fonts used quite a bit, but the story was slow at times. There was almost no charicter development and the plotlines were dated. Still, the surprise ending does what it intends."
5,Coding,Thankful for the guide lines. This has been very helpful. The price was right. I probably should look into getting a newer issue. In time. Thank you
3,As exciting as the phone book,"You really need to WANT to have the Residential Code to wade through the 'jargon' in it. The answers ARE there, but you have to look for them. The chart on window and door header requirements is nearly 3 pages long! The code must cover all possibilities, but it doesn't need to be so technical that only 'inspectors' can decipher it (if they're lucky). The 2002 National Electric Code is just as complex, but it is written to be understood by nearly anyone. I hope the editors/writers of the next version of the IRC take the hint."
1,international residential code 2003,contacted seller of this book several times informing him that I never received the book I purchased. Never received a reply. So I can't rate a purchase the seller for some reason I guess I will never know why I did not receive.
4,10yrs old and still a good groove,"paa leez! why no reviews? this cd has more groove per minute than just about anything out there (and not the ""boom-tish, boom-tish, boom-tish stuff either!). 10 years old and it still sounds good; not too much ""outdated"" here. ""COLD ROCK"" when played thru headphones at a respectable volume could resurrect the dead!"
2,Mediocre Homage to Jacques Demy,"My advice is to skip this French movie musical and get Jacques Demy's ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" instead. This movie is clearly an homage to the Demy films (to the point of casting his son as the leading man, even though he doesn't really fit the type), but ""Jeanne and the Perfect Guy"" lacks the charm and the visual inventiveness of the Demy films. The best thing about the movie is Virginie Ledoyen, who is as beautiful and appealing as the young Catherine Deneuve was in Demy's most popular films. The worst thing is the music. It's downright awful and the mediocre songs only made me aware of how important Michel Legrand's score were to Jacques Demy's films and the importance of a good score to any movie musical in general. I'm sure the filmmakers heart was in the right place (especially in their efforts to bring topics like immigration and AIDS to the musical genre), but their musical and visual execution falls short."
3,Note for DVD Karaoke not a CD,"I didn't read closely enough that this was a DVD vs. CD for Karaoke. Thus, we weren't able to use it for our disco party. Still, that was completely my error, not the seller's, and I really appreciated the seller's quick turnaround to get it to us in time. Next time I just need to slow down and read the product info more closely."
4,"Great inside to Iran from a ""street' preson's view","Ms Bird's easy style of writing combined with her warm personal touch made the book extremely enjoyable. This is as close as one can get to travelling to Iran. I have not visited Iran in 24+ years and always wondered about the country after all these years. Her approach was very unique and most preferrable to all the more indepth and political books.She convinced me that it is worth travelling to Iran and visiting it again. I had completely given up on the country after all these years of ""one-sided"" press coverages.Thank you for sharing with all of us your great trip."
4,American view of Iran,"I am facinated with Iran, and am reading everything that I can get my hands on. I first read Honeymoon in Purdah, and enjoyed that much more. This account is still interesting, but I find lacks the flavour of other novels I have read on travel to Iran. That being said, the novel is interesting, an offers a glimpse of Iranian life that I had not seen before, proof that everyone's experience of a country is unique. Chrisitane offers a unique and revealing view of Iran, both modern and ancient. She encounters many wonderful, colourful characters along the way, and has many different experiences. Excellent reading."
4,The Most Beautiful Cover for A Book,"As said, the cover of this book is exquisite and most inviting. The text, which I'm only half-way through is good too, but a bit long. It could have been cut and still worked. But it's worth owning for its insights into Iran and more: for the sheer beauty of its cover and typeface. Someone went to great lengths to make this one of the most attractive texts going."
2,author should have died her hair brown b4 leaving for Iran,"I was surprised how much the author talked abouther ""blondness"", or ""tallness"" and how afraidshe was of her ""blond hair"" showing from the sidesof her head covering. It makes you think thesePersians must be such awful people they are goingto harm her because of blond hair peeking throughher chador. Of course that was not the case ratherit was the author who was fixated on herown ""blond"" hair. Ms Bird also kept talkingabout her ""Western face"" which made me wonderwhat an Eastern face is. Persians are Aryans(Iran meaning Aryan) and though darker thanAmericans they are Caucasians. I felt she was too hungup on whatever physical differences there wereand this did not allowher to get close to her subjects or to her reader.Persian Mirrors author Elaine made the samemistake and kept talking about the chador throughouther book (thank God she wasn't blond!!) which makes thesebooks on IRAN written by American women have a very narrowfocus."
5,I loved this book!,"I loved this book on Iran. It was like going on a leisurely trip to a fascinating place with the best of travel companions. Christiane Bird is a thoughtful, witty, extremely well-informed writer who filled in exactly what I wanted to know of the backstory for every event of the trip: the history and politics, the philosophy, the poetry and architecture. She notices and muses about the nuances and diversity of Iranian culture in a way that made me feel smarter and more perceptive just for having read her book (as if her intelligence and human warmth could be contagious!) She gets my vote for ""Author I'd most like to have dinner with""."
2,Regular,"Aunque la version de la parte correspondiente a los temas de Jeff Wayne son bastante aceptables, el complemento de la version de la pelicula de Spilberg, no es tan bueno, pero puede gustar a aquellos que les gustan los temas de Sci-Fi"
5,Cute and great use!,Great for if you want to give the inside of your car a little life! Why have boring black mats when you can have these ones :)?
4,More recent model,The more recent model 7200-10 has more bang for the buck. 10 MB buffer and has 300 MB storage.
1,MORE INFO PLEASE!!!,"IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW THE LENGTH AND WIDTH OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS: 30251, 30623, 30381, 30751. Details please rather than just a copy/paste of the Product Description.Thank you."
3,quality inconsistant,"My last order of the 1"" Sashco backer rod was a disapointment. Not only was the material not ""round"" but simi round with some flatnened sides, but also segments had been taped together to complete the order. I expected new really good looking material."
2,Not what I expected,"If you're looking for a foam filler that remains spongy and retains it's shape after you squeeze it, look somewhere else. This goes flat after you squeeze it in place. It is not a seal."
1,"Great idea, BAD PRODUCT","I bought two of these and both fell apart after being exposed to the elements after one season. I simply made my own using the same idea out of materials that would last, those are still holding up fine! Skip this item, either make your own or buy another brand."
3,Works as expected,We use it on our RV trailer step and it has held up thru a 6000 mile trip and a number of shorter trips since then. It is easy to install.
4,Step rug,"Bought this for our pop-up camper,installed very easily.Already showing signs of wear after only 2 weekend camping trips.But it had that great Amazon price with free shipping."
4,Works just fine,"I saw mixed reviews and bought anyway. I should have just both two of them right off the bat. Bought the one, put it on, and it looks fine. If I run into problems with the springs, I think there are lots of things I can do to bind it to the step. Fits my RV step just fine. Now I will order the second one. If the springs hold up, that will be great because it is good to be able to take it off easily to wash the rug."
3,"Nice rugs, springs not so great","The rugs work very well, but the springs aren't very strong, we lost one on our first trip out, would have given it a better review if it hadn't been for that"
5,One of my favs,If you like David Caruso you will see him at his best in this intense drama. Ned's desire for justice is well placed when the father of the convicted killer takes the jury hostage.
1,How NASA faked the lunar landings,"The author of this book has not done the investigative work himself, but merely copied the information and photographs from a website known as www.geocities.com/apolloreality. That website has been in existence since 1997, and hence the author of that website should take the credit, and not Mr Hawkins.Mr Hawkins accomplice, a Maria Morreli actually has an e-mail on the feedback page which confirms that the info was copied from his webpage. Has Mr Hawkins has made a reference to the fact, and is paying royalties to the author of apolloreality, I doubt it."
5,I think the person writing the last review never read thbook,"I read the last reviewers remarks and had my dad order me the book anyways because the author seemed to really know what he was talking about on the radio.When I got my book I could not believe how big the book was and how it was filled with so many pictures. It covers everything related to the moon landings, I mean everything. There are probably over 500 different pieces of evidence proving how NASA could have faked the moon landings.This other site the last reviewer mention has only two or three topics related to the moon landings being fake and I could hardly find any mention related to this other website's theory. On one page there is a mention of a somewhat similar topic but the author's theory total contradicts that websites theory. [...]"
4,great way to see the golden age titles; only in larger print,"Even though this book is three years out of date it's worth owning just to open and to see the many golden age comic book covers in it. The only problem I have is that unlike the overstreet guide they don't tell you what features were running in the title at the time. For instance when did ""green arrow"" start and end in ""more fun"" comics? This guide being older is now so cheap that it's just a cool memento now to check out the many colored cover pictures. Overstreet remains the only guide that gives you detailed info on what strip was featured in each golden age comic and that's why that one is a good one to have to see what was in each issue as well."
2,Not for this Urban Girl,"If you are looking for a book on how to live on a limited income, this is not your book. Nina Wildorf seems to live in a world that doesn't involve student loans, car payments, or the idea of a savings account. Her rule of thimb for budgeting is 20% of your income towards clothes. This is not fical responsibility.And only wash your jeans every 6 months so that they don't fade? Really? Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?On the other hand, she does have some cute ideas for decorating on the cheap--I am glad to see that someone besides me goes dumpster diving!"
2,Meh,"I generally enjoy reading books like this that include suggestions for saving money while still having a good time. It occurred to me recently, however, that more than a couple of the suggested ways to save money involve being dishonest on some level, which does not sit right with me. Also, there is a sort of assumption that image is extremely important to you and therefore it is good to promote an image of wealth and status while getting a discount on your gym membership because you lied about being a student. I am not finished reading the book yet, but I am over half way and this seems to be the general trend. I don't think I will be recommending it to my friends for this reason."
3,City Chic is great if you're a recent college grad or early 20something,"I thought this book would help me learn unique tips and techniques for saving money. But the book is written for the recent college grad or someone who has just gotten their first job or apartment. It's not realistic for anyone who has a somewhat decent income and is slightly older. For instance; one of the tips for getting cheap furniture is to go 'dumpster diving'. Well, I'd love to get inexpensive furniture as much as the next girl; but am beyond the point of scouring the trash of others for it. Like I said- great book for anyone whose income is basically non-existant."
2,Fluff,"really obvious suggestions. maybe OK if you're just out of high school or college and clueless. otherwise, save your money."
2,bad fluff,"the other reviewers are correct in that there are a few nuggets of knowledge in this book, but nothing that hasnt been written somewhere else. they are also correct that the budgeting, beauty, and food ideas are basically bad advice. i found this book underinformed and uninteresting. the author seems to know a smattering about everything but an expert on nothing... dont waste your time."
3,Practical for college students.,"I found this alright, has some good information. Nothing too special-check it out at the library, don't recommend buying."
1,Also thought this book was godawful,"I am SO glad I didn't spend money buying this book. I agree with the points that some of her recommendations are just not responsible advice for young women who are trying to live frugally in a metropolitan area. Spend 1/5 of one's (pre-tax) starting salary on clothing? And it's realistic to spend up to 50% of your (again, pre-tax) income on housing? What was she thinking advising readers that this is ""livin' large on less""? It's a great way to end up broke! I say no way, Nina!"
5,A Practical Inspiration,"I have read this book four times. No, I'm not kidding about this. It's an inspiration! It's well-written and totally practical, without encouraging the elimination of all the good things in life. It has enhanced my ability to not only live within my means, but save money for the things that really matter to me (rather than blowing it on things like $12 cosmos). I consider it an essential purchase, especially in these challenging economic times. Thanks, Nina!"
5,Very informative,"Already packed with things i learned on my own, and more that will help me in the future."
3,Not Great But Still Pretty Good,"I've been on a kick lately, reading fashion books. This one was fun to read and had some good ideas. At the same time, it seems to presume that the reader lives in a major city such as New York. It's entertaining and you might be a tidbit or two that you don't already know."
5,Black Love,This music is so wonderful and not to mention the movie I love seeing my people in a great movie.
5,One of the best,"Arguably one of the best soundtracks. it captures the mood and melody of this movie to the fullest. this soundtrack still makes you feel great. the rendition of the john coltrane & duke ellington - in a sentamental mood, is just dam. to great lol"
5,Cassie has a fresh soulful sound and a great future ahead,"This will be the greatest soundtrack of all times it has so much grit blend with smooth sounds of the old rythm and blues while still giving the jazz classics. It's time that a soundtrack actually complented the motion picture. I was really surprised that the song ""Girl"" did not get more air time or commericial support, it seemed to encompass the entire movie. Top preformances from every one on this effort."
5,"Sexy, sensual, and stunning-something to set your night to!!","This soundtrack is one of my all time favorites. With a sultry mix of hip-hop, R&B, and mesmerizing jazz, the music captivates you. Whether you are alone or in for a romantic evening at home,this album covers every mood."
5,A Ground Breaking Album For Me!,"This is one of those records that broke me out of my hardcore Hip Hop phase back in the 1990's. Between this record and D'Angelo's ""Brown Sugar"" my musical world was turned upside down! I still listen to these songs now.Also, I really hoped this film would create new opportunities for real black romance films to be made. That did not happen, but it does not take anything away from this soundtrack. Let's get back to playing love songs to each other like this!"
4,Smell the Roses,"A nice, easy-listening, clean-up-the-house-on-Saturday-afternoon-and-chill CD. I love it. The selection of artists for this compilation was right on the money; the songs flow beautifully together. Duke Ellington and John Coltrane's ""In A Sentimental Mood"" is the cherry on top. If you have seen or own the movie, get the soundtrack and relive it all over again."
5,Nice Blends!!!!!,"First off I would like to say that this is a wonderful cd when Jermaine Dupri (So-So- Def) this is a nice cd done by some good singers this is a good cd I love this cd I listen to it all of the time especially when I am taking a long and hot bubble bath it really does relax you the slow grooves the nice sounds of the music and the voices blend in together well and I like this cd this is a good cd it contains some remakes but one of my favorites on here is ""Minnie Ripperton's "" Inside My Love done so very well from Trina Broussard who has a very nice voice and she needs to do another album as well I enjoy this album it is so nice it contains hopeless, the sweetest thing, I wanna go outside in the rain, and many other great songs this is one of my favorite sonundtracks if you enjoy the blues, rhythm and blues, jazz, and poetry then you will definitely enjoy this cd so therefore I reccommend that you buy it because you will definitely enjoyit!!!!!"
4,"Some Real Gems on This CD, Make it Worth Considering","When I first heard ""Hopeless,"" the Dionne Farris track that opens the film (it's also the first song on the CD), I was hooked. The lyrics are great with a track the reminds one of classic 1970s soul.Also included in the set is ""The Sweetest Thing"" by the Refugee Camp All-Stars. This is the first song featuring Lauryn Hill on vocals that captivated me.Another gem on the CD is ""Rush Over"" by bassist Marcus Miller with Me'Shell N'degeocello on vocals. The interplay between these two artists on this track help make this CD worth purchasing.The CD also includes some classic tracks like Duke Ellington's ""In a Sentimental Mood"" and a re-recorded version of Minnie Riperton's ""Inside My Love"" by Trina Broussard. While Ms. Broussard does a nice rendition, you're left wanting to re-visit the classic version.Overall, the soundtrack is an above average CD. One wishes that some of the other tracks were as distinctive as the ones mentioned above."
4,I really like it,"I was very pleased with the physical condition of the cd itself. But as far as the contents, there were only like 2 songs that I even like. However, I don't regret my purchase."
5,Excuse Me I'll Have Another Glass Of Wine Please,"Hello I cannot see why anyone would give this album anything but *****. This was hands down one of the best soundtracks of the 90's to groove to. Its perfect for a cocktail party, making love or just enjoying yourself. Even thought this album is more than 7 years old it still sounds refreshing . I cannot find another soundtrack to come close. I highly recommend this album to many great songs to miss out on ."
5,pretty upset,"I'm upset because the soundtrack I bought from my university's bookstore (because at the time I wanted it I couldn't find it anywhere else and hadn't heard of amazon.com yet) for over $16 DOES NOT have the beginning poem on it!!! What gives?!?! Did I receive a dud? It's not even on the list of songs so it was never on it to begin with. The whole soundtrack is great yes, but I really wanted to hear beautiful Larenz speak to me!"
3,Neo-Soul 101,"To get a crash course in the beginning of neo-soul, pick up the Love Jones soundtrack. There's a lot of gems in here like Lauryn Hill's ""The Sweetest Thing"", and Dionne Farris' ""Hopeless"" won her black fans back who left after ""I Know"". Maxwell's ""Sumthin' Sumthin'"" remix is sheer baby-making music while other tracks by Groove Theory, Cassandra Wilson and Kenny Lattimore also impress.If only they could have left out the terrible remake of ""In the Rain"" by Xscape, the horribly generic ""Girl"" by Cassie, and the wack poetry that began and ended the album by two of the movie's main characters. But that's why they have things like fast-forward and program buttons."
2,where is that reggae groove- can't stop loving you?,I can't stop loving you is the bomb music in love jones.For it to be missed out is simply a crime. The soudd track gets a 2 star for it.Austin
1,Payment made no CD Sent,"I never recieved the CD ordered..I e-mail this seller twice, but they never contacted me.I was forced to complete an order form for a full refund."
2,Love The Software - HATE THE COMPANY,"Quickbooks software is great - I really do love it, but if you need ANY TYPE OF HELP...forget it. Intuit, Quickbooks Publisher, is as custom UNFRIENDLY as companies get.I have used quickbooks for years including several upgrades and additional services. I had a computer crash and lost the software - and everything else. I have the disks but since they are upgrade CD not the ""full program"" I can't reload the software onto my new system.Help from Quickbooks? Not unless I am willing to pay $50-$149 the cost of buying the brand new software which I shouldn't have to do.Quickbooks offers the worst customer service of any company I have ever done business with so if all you want is great software, then Quickbooks is for you. If you MAY EVER need any type of support, avoid all Intuit products; Quicken, Quickbooks, TurboTax and more.Chad Currin"
1,No product received,"Ordered this item and waited three weeks and did not receive the item. Sender checked to see what happened to my item, and she found out they sent it to another address. I am still out of QuickBooks 2002."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"As a previous owner I can say without reservation that this package was a collosal waste of my money but more importantly it wasted a lot of my time. No multi-currency support so forget it if you do any business internationally. Report generating capabilities are terrible compared with other products (e.g.MYOB). Also, to get the rebate you need to be a prior user of the product so you're out of luck if you are buying your first package."
4,PASSWORD,"This isn't so much a review, but I had a problem yesterday and was told to write to quickbooks. This is the only site I could find. I recently installed the updated version and have been using since 10/21.I turned my computer on last night and before I could go into quickbooks it wanted a password. I never enter passwords.I called tech support and they insisted I entered a password, as I am the only person who uses the program and the computer is in my hame I have no need to use passwords.I then shut down the computer and restarted it and I was able to go into quickbooks.I would like someone to tell me why this happened.The tech support people were of no help."
1,"""upgrades"" that downgrade","This program not only requires you to subscribe to their Payroll services to fully use the program - rather costly for a small operation - but when I downloaded an ""upgrade"", it removed the ability to print out W-2 and W-3 forms. It will not even compute and preview. The only way to print out the forms is to subscribe to their Payroll Services."
2,Hidden charges,"In order to use payroll past a certain time limit, you must subscribe to Intuit's tax table service and pay them... each year. They do NOT allow you to edit the tax tables yourself. The program is way too complicated for the average small business user. It includes lots of pretty icons that are probably meant to distract you from the fact that it takes a week to learn how to write checks and post bills. You will not use or need 90% of what this program can do. And God forbid you want to post to a journal other than cash receipts or disbursements. If you make a mistake, your accountant will charge you by the hour to find it and fix it."
1,ONE STAR IS TO HIGH A RATING,I bought a version of Quickbooks back in 1996 that I thought worked pretty well. Sure it flashed a warning every time that said my tax tables were out of date but at least it still let me use them. I bought the new version and found it to be way more than I needed. In fact it slowed down my computer so much I upgraded that too. When I called to get the key code to transfer it over to the new computer there was no problem. When I went to do payroll I found out that none of the information had transferred over. I called customer service and was told I was only allowed one free download. I would have to pay [more money] to get the payroll information download. I felt that was unfair and the rep on the phone got pretty rude. This will be the last time I purchase any Intuit product. It is not user friendly by any means.
1,Quickly Taken by Quick Books,"We tried it back in 1999. The sample CD came in and we figured that the full version just had to be better. We were wrong. It is not user friendly and the support is user hostile, but we had already entered our entire inventory into it (actually we had to do it twice), so we figured we'd stick it out.Our computer crashed in a terminal way about a month ago, and the replacement wouldn't accept the 99 demo disk because it wasn't compatible with the version of Windows on our new computer.I called to find out how to get Quick Books back and the answer is that I must buy Quick Books 2002 upgrade and then talk Intuit into giving me a special key code that will permit us to run it.Forget it, Quick Books Basic doesn't even interface with other common software we use."
1,Very difficult (impossible??) program,"What? No option for no stars or negative stars?? I have used QuickBooks for several years at the request of the accountants I work with. The updated 2002 version (I used QB99) is, if possible, even more difficult to navigate. ""Support"" for the product is at additional cost. Online banking is three times what I pay for online banking with the major banks I use for that service and download into Quick Books is not supported by those same banks. This necessitates a great deal of additional input!!! Also, I cannot email statements or files without the Online Banking at the additional cost."
2,.,I dig the subject and I was rooting for this book but it is so horribly put together it becomes useless.It's like unto those 'True Ghost Stories' books; all anecdotes and little substance.
3,Future Memory,"No new ideas, just renamed from some of her other books. Waste of money, gave it away. I was leery but since the subject interests me, I decided to try it."
3,Memory,"A good Near Death Experience NDE book that actually progresses the NDE. I always wanted to read a PMH Atwater book. It is definitely far out. In truth everything is already over and the only thing that is eternal is the ""now""."
2,Bugger if I know,"Bugger me.I gave up reading it half way through.I think you have to be someone who has actually had a near death experience to understand what its actually about.It starts out great and it tells you a few simple story's and you go ""wow thats amazing"",but then it drifts off into another planet.I skipped pages to find something I could gather but it made no difference.I just didn't understand what it was trying to say and I ended up really frustrated.I take my hat off to anyone who can understand it."
2,an impassioned testimonial but nothing like science...,"Whilst some of the more profound and wide-ranging, far out, suggestions/conclusions of Phyllis Atwater may well be correct...this book is much more personal testimonial and intellectual autobiography than it is science or structured argument. Often the author is found to be arguing by analogy...and yet the point about analogies is that ""there is a difference"" ie argument by analogy is often flawed. I agree with the suggestion the book is poorly structured. I could immediately have found alternative ways of suggesting reasons for radically different world views...and I could have found more solid evidence that was more clearly and thoroughly documented. Where are the references eg to McMoneagle or Radin or Robert Monroe?"
1,A big disappointment,"If you loved ""East West"" and are looking for some more great Butterfield music, you should probably stay far away from this CD. The excitement and enthusiasm and power of that seminal recording is completely lost in Pigboy, and the album just doesn't have much going for it."
4,Splinter Cell:Chaos Theory,All in all not a bad strategy guide. Walk-through is clear and will get you through the levels with ease. It gives you options on how to play your game either through stealth or kill everybody in sight. All objectives are given to you and where you can find them. The walk-through pictures suggesting where you should position yourself are a little dark. They could of been a little brighter.
2,"nice idea, modest result","Sometimes kids say the the mostcharming things, but this isn'tone of those times--too manyunfunny selections."
5,Definitely Worth Buying,"This book turned out to be all that I expected: good condition, and revealing and fascinating content. It is definitely worthwhile."
5,Awesome!,"Received product promptly. Had old cassette of it, but wanted CD to be able to listen often. Greatly enjoying!!"
4,The Fix is Hot,"Scarface new CD ""The Fix"" is a very hot CD! The tracks on the CD are nice with a mix of R&B and Hip-Hop beats. The song ""My Block"" is one of my favorites because he expresses his experience growing up on ""his block"". Also the collaberation with Faith Evans with the song ""Someday"" is another great song on his album, I love the beat and the lyrics of the song. I give Scarface CD the Fix Four Stars, for his beats, lyrics, and just overall performance"
2,def jam???,"Ol' Skool Face goes to Def Jam and all of a sudden he has loyal and hardcore fans?. lol. Come on now, and why is NAS and JAY Z on here? You screaming FACE MOB when there is no1 from FACE MOB even on here! There isn't even anybody from Rap A Lot!This CD has a few good songs and thats it... no1 can deny that face is a living legend in the rap game but where was all his fans a couple of years ago?"
4,One of the realest records I've ever heard,"This album is excellent. From his collaboration with Nas on In Between Us, to his tales of life on the streets in Keep Me Down or Safe, this album tells many amazing stories. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes rap. And to the guy who said that it's a bad album because he swears, and that he is not truly Christian for it: He is more truly Christian than you, who excludes someone from the religion just for something he says. You are not even really listening to Face's message. To take it right from him in Keep Me Down: you don't really want a N. to climb. you'd rather separate me from my family forever. Instead of tryin to keep us together, you M.F. would rather keep me down."
4,Fixed,"I'm more into rock, and not one who knows all that much about rap, and I know even less about Scarface, but this is extremely good. I like it because you can tell this isn't trying to be anything other than what it is. Just really good rap. The thing I notice about it most, is that it sounds fresh, and old school at the same time. I guess you could call it a ""new classic"". My favorite thing is the lyrics booklet covered in pot leaves that comes in it's own little ziploc bag. That's gangsta!"
5,All men can find the spirit of God in music.,"I am so proud that he never lost faith in he own talent, by never going commercial; moreover, not selling out his beliefs to the music industry.It seems that he found God recently in my opinion. It's all good by me.This compulation CD has it all from Rap/Hip-Hop/R&B/Gospel. His spriitually favored cuts grabs you from the soul. By listening to the lyrics you will find this man has talent in all respects of the game of life/future beliefs in the love of life within his music. This CD can grap your soul if you let it,coming correct in what I would call ""Music-Law."" I love all music! This CD works from all aspects of skills and/or talent regradless of the miss-understood realm of Rap. It touched me. The man has unbound talent. Go-Run-tell-That!"
5,Tha King Of Tha South,"Yo...Scarface takes it back to tha roots of hip-hop and really lets his emotions and feeling's out, while still keepin' it gangsta...on this album he hits you with nuttin' but lyrical [...]...earning himself his second spot in The Source's 5 mic category...Scarface and Nas supply you with your ""Fix"" on the lyrical high ""In Between Us""...WC also does a great job on""I Ain't The One""...Beanie Segal suprisingly ""cooks up some dope lyrics"" to add to your ""Fix"" on the catchy song ""Guess Who's Back"",which also features Jay-Z, produced by Kanye West. But overall Face's solo joints are incredible...I'm sure 2pac,Biggie, Big Pun, Big L, and all the other great lyricists that don' passed away are thankin' Scarface for keeping Hip-Hop alive...I advise you to cop this album its definitly the first step into saving Hip-Hop...and while your at it pick up his first 5 mic status album ""The Diary"", you won't be disapointed.I'm Out, REAL Hip-Hop 4 ever!...Shout out to all my down south [...]!"
5,Off the Hook,"This Is a hot CD. I got it when it first came out and I still listen to it all the time and that's hard for me to do. I highly reccomend anyone wanting hot lyrics and make you bounce beats. Go get ""The Fix""."
4,Bob Mould has a great ear,"I saw Jason & Alison (founding members of Verbow) open for Bob Mould in 1995 and they were a ferocious duo. I was very pleased with their full band thang when I bought Chronicles and Bob did them up right with his production style. ""Fan Club"" rocks and is funny, too. ""Down the Gun"" is a firey cd closer. And I like ""lethargy's Crown""."
4,Wonderful set for a Young Artist,"What I love about this kit is that it comes with everything that a little artist needs. The portfolio part is a wonderful added touch, they can place their art in it, and present it to you like a gallery showing. I really love that they are starting to create items like this showcase young artists. It is a wonderful start to a life time art."
5,Brilliant read & incisive,"Orlando Figes has done a remarkable job of taking a subject as complex as the Russian revolution & turning it into a rollercoaster anecdotal read. The principal characters- Lenin, Stalin , Lvov & of course Nicholas come out finely etched. A wonderful read"
2,"Lots of anecdotes, short on analysis","Figes' work gives a great deal of information on Russia to the reader without properly analyzing it. His description of the outbreak of the First World War is basically wrong and he gives far too much credit to pan-slavism for prompting Russia's entry into the war than he does the alliance system or any of the other international events of the July Crisis. He continues to repeat the myths of the Russian Army fighting with sticks which were demolished back in the '70s by Norman Stone.As for the Revolution, he is contradictory in a number of areas, at one point describing the attack on Poland in 1920 defensive, and then a few pages later portraying it as a measure to spread revolution to Germany.The use of a mass of material combined with lack of analysis don't make a good book!"
4,"A Great Narrative History, But..............................","I will not bother adding to the already voluminous amounts of praise afforded Figes' work here at Amazon. Despite its size (over 800 pages), the tome is, indeed, a wonderfully sweeping and and well-written chronological history of the Russian Revolution. However, a few -- very short -- qualifications are in order. First, Figes' often makes occasionally annoying (and inaccurate) sociological and psychological observations about ""revolution"" best left to social scientists; and second, his perspective tends to be (not infrequently) ideologically right-of-center, suggesting a link to the Post-Soviet ""I-Told-You-So"" school of Russian historiography currently fashionable among Western scholars. Enjoy, fellow readers, but Figes' monumental study, contrary to what is so boldly stated on the back cover, is NOT the last word on the subject.........."
1,"Too complex, impracticable","While reading I found myself folding numerous pages to flip back and forth trying to understand information the book is trying to convey. Too complex, too time consuming, too much minutia, too tedious and basically impracticable reading. I still have no understanding of the Russian Revolution so I am searching for another book."
5,Exactly how Russian history should be written,"One will rarely find a Russian history book that is so stimulating, detailed and original. Its greatest strength is its combination of the traditional ""top-down"" narrative - what went on at the Tsarist court, in the Duma and in the upper reaches of the Bolshevik party - with ""bottom-up"" accounts of what life was like for ordinary people in the cities, factories and, above all, the far-flung rural estates and provinces of Russia. Many histories of late Tsarist Russia, the Revolution and the early Soviet period are difficult to read because they are arid, lacking in human detail and burdened with abstract theories of little interest to anyone except self-important historians. But this book is extravagantly rich in detail and often written in an exuberant, entertaining style. One last point: the photographs reprinted in the book are absolutely first-class, telling as much about this period of Russian history as the text itself."
4,Figes can write,"I like to read history, but I often become distracted and lost by the generally poor quality of most historians' writing style. Not so with this Figes. He can write, for sure. I'll agreee to some extent with others who have said that this book ""fails"" to come to any conclusions/judgments. But, for me, that's quite secondary to the fact that this book is the finest example of history writing I've come across."
5,5 Stars,One of the best books I have ever read on the Russian Revolution. Any Slavophile will find the information presented in this book to be a great time investment !!!
4,Full of information,"This book gave me all the information I wanted to know about the Russian Revolution. It shows what a deeply disappointing tragedy the whole affair was, to just about everyone involved except Stalin and possibly Lenin. This book was written shortly after the creation of the Russian Federation in the mid-1990s, so the author spends a great deal of time analyzing ""what went wrong"" in founding a democracy in Russia in 1917, and how to hopefully avoid those mistakes in the 1990s.I have a small criticism to make about this book: the author hardly ever introduces a character with his full name, which makes it difficult to search for information for the person online. I don't think any author should ever introduce a historical figure by calling them only by their last name."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"When I was searching for Davidoff Cool Water to buy as a gift for my husband, I came across the product - Davidoff Cool Water Eau de Toilette Natural Spray for Men. I placed an order for the item (although it said packaging may differ). When I received the item, it turned out to be MILD DEODORANT SPRAY as opposed to what I wanted - an EDT spray. Even now discrepancies exist when I look back at the item on my Amazon Order page - My order says I purchased - Cool Water By Davidoff For Men. Mild Deodorant Spray 2.5 Ounces but when I click on the link, it shows me a page describing the product as an Eau de Toilette Natural Spray for Men. Feel like I was cheated. So anyone buying, please make sure you check the item carefully. Just because I paid $17, it didn't seem worth it to go through the trouble of returning the item. I'd rather buy another EDT from a better seller or another site online."
2,"Not one of the better, detailed or updated books available.",Stated that book was revised. However this book was revised over 3 years ago and contains much material that I know is outdated. Examples: Dr listing in the back is inaccurate -- several doctors are no longer at stated clinics and had left clinics around 1995. Some of the procedures discussed are no longer the norm -- newer methods have replaced them.
5,You must have this book!,This book saved my sanity. It gave me the education I needed to take charge of my own fertility. It explained things that the doctors didn't. It was a source of reference to back up what they did say. Most of all it gave me the confidence to walk away from Doctors that didn't specialize in my needs and to find someone that did. AND every room in my Doctors office had a copy of this book! - Get it - It's worth every cent.
4,Watch Out,"Just wanted to note that after viewing the entire series at a friends house, I, too had wanted a copy of them. Great information and from a fairly reliable and somewhat unbiased source. I have attempted to purchase the series now 3 different times. Each time, (different suppliers) have always mailed only ONE disc to me (even charged my account $80...for one disc?). Just wanted to give a heads up and Watch Out for any 'missing discs'....heck, it might be a conspiracy.......someone does not want me to have the entire series on disc. I have let the suppliers know, but, they continue to list the product. Hope everyone else is getting what they ordered. Question the Answers.......Peace Out."
1,Disappointing book!,"I just received a copy of the American Cinematographer Video Manual, 3rd addition. What a major disappointment. Cheap binding. Poorly printed black and white photographs. Margins are too wide on each page. Why not print more words on each page resulting in narrower margins? Because of fast changing technology the book really needs to be updated each year. That 2001 copyright resulted in much of the video equipment models being outdated. What an embarrassment for the American Cinematographer Society publishing division."
2,Don't waste your money,"On the ASC website they misleadingly portray this book as updated with the latest information. Well, the copyright date for the 3rd edition is 2001, that's right, it's 10 years old. Other than the fundamentals on IRE levels and time code etc. it was a great disappointment to find little relevance to the remarkable advances in video based cinematography that have occured since the Red Cam for example."
3,not enough for beginers,"I think this book covers alot of subjects, but the depth of each subject is very shallow. if I didn't know many of these things before reading this book I wouldn't understand more than half the explanaisions.I still havn't finished reading because it's just not informitive enough"
1,Very bad and very simplistic,"A very simplistic work by a minor philosopher (I use this word lightly). Wow, so bad, so dumb, such a waste of time. Those other books you are considering reading first? Go again."
1,It sucks!,It is not worth buying it at all!!! What kind comments were those above mine??????????????????????
4,Great for outsiders,"I would highly recommend this book to people in the MCSE or management crowd who want to understand what motivates people to work on complex software projects without receiving any monetary reward.Although I would not classify myself as a hacker in the strictest sense of the definition, most people would consider me to be one. I find most of this information to be commonly known or discussed amongst the geek community, but it's great to have such keen insight packed in to this small book. Even if you're familiar with hacker culture, it's always insightful to look at subjects through the eyes of others."
3,Running mate,Made for tv movie. Makes you think how elections for our goverment work. Slow at times.
2,Not what I expected!,"I bought this movie thinking I was going to be in for a good laugh, but instead found a movie about people in politics that were sad and annoying. I couldn't get into it and had a hard time finding any humor in it at all. I got half way through it and had to turn it off. Maybe I was expecting a satire on politics, instead what was revealed was the truth in politics and that isn't funny. If the movie had fallen under a drama, I may have been able to get through it, but then again I probably wouldn't have bought it at all. I only give it two stars because Selleck gives his usual performance as a caring guy, but this time in the wrong storyline."
1,Plug Your Ears!,This is Brownell's PhD. thesis turned textbook--a sure formula for trouble. Three editions later it is still an incoherent mess of bad design and weak writing. This is only in print because no other current textbook in listening is available.The only reason to buy this book is because it is assigned reading. The subject is exceptionally rich but boredom awaits you. The end of chapter exercises are decent. Learning and communication theory is insufficiently applied in organization and presentation of ideas. Key themes & phrases are buried deep in paragraphs and the wrong sentences get bolded. Expect a merry chase to pull out what she is talking about. Pitiful excuse for a textbook.
3,OK for school lockers,This product is satisfactory for school and gym lockers but I would want something beefier for protecting high-value contents.
5,soft and flowery...,"I purchased this item as a gift for my dad. The scent it really soft and flowery and not as spicy as most men's fragrances are. I opened the pack and tested it before giving it as a gift, to make sure the scent smells good. Overall, i liked it, and the smell is not overwhelming, or too heavy.It may be more appropriate for younger men though. It is a little on the feminine side i think, since the base does not have too much woodsy notes. I would reccommend if you're looking for a soft and romantic scent."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Limited general information and sometimes wrong (such as Brigitte's Bardot's ""real"" name). It mostly consists of listening to the stars' movie trailers which is very uninteresting since they were developed to be shown on screen not radio. Especially silly is listening to Brigitte Bardot's since most of her films shown in the US were dubbed, so you not only are not seeing her but not even hearing her own voice. This is of no value."
1,BUYER BEWARER THIS BOGUS BOOTLEG!,"If you want to hear masterful early Garland recordings from her Decca years and MGM soundtracks, buy the LEGITIMATE CDs! Buy Judy's DECCA box, and the wonderful RHINO/Turner MGM soundtrackcollections.This pirated piece of purloined garbage is a British bootleg stolen from the original masters with no payment going to the Garland estate for the use of her recordings.Do not support this thievery. STAY AWAY!"
1,Headlight,"Looks good but signal light socket had the wrong cut on the socket fit, I had to modify the socket to fit the light, I would not purchase again. If I have to change the bulb I do not think it will come out without breaking it. I give this a grade F."
3,So funny movie.,I bought it just because Rupert Penry-Jones is in it but it turned out to be a really funny movie and has a message too.
2,Not that bad of a movie but the story was a bit dumb.,The movie was confusing and the hole points of the movie was grate at first but then it just dint appeal to me anymore. I say you can pass this movie up.
4,I was entertained every second of the movie..............,This is one of those sci-fi comedies that provides continuous entertainment right to the end. The sex humour was great and a good moral is taught at the end of the show. The sound track was superbly aggressive with excellent programming in the LFE area. If you're into teen comedy then this is certainly for you.
3,"Sorry, you'd better buy the video tape !","There's not interest, because it's the same thing that on their albums. It's better to buy the tape, even if it's not the same price..."
3,"Not particularly bad, but not particularly good","The G3 tour was one of the best show I have ever seen, and this cd does an ok job of capturing that magic. I was a little disappointed with the song selection for Eric Johnson based mainly on the fact that ""The Cliffs of Dover"" was not included on this disc (which I feel is one of the greatest songs of all time, and certainly Eric Johnson's best). When all three get together to jam at the end can send chills down your spine, much like it did live in concert. The rendition of ""My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama"" blew me away, and the cover of Hendrix's ""Red House"" is nothing short of brilliant. I just wish they would have made this at least a double cd so Satriani, Vai, and Johnson could each have had more than 3 songs on it. Overall, it's not a bad album. Buy it used, don't pay full price. Best $5 I ever spent."
3,some interesting playing,"I wasn't expecting much from an album like this to start with-instrumentals get boring pretty soon unless they are extraordinary like Surfing with the Alien. And I was right. Hironically, Vai blows away Satriani and Johnson even if I don't really like his style. Vai really shows unbelievable speed and technique here.As far as Satriani, as usual when playing live he loses quite a bit compared to studio albums-I guess the guitar effects do not come out as nicely.Johnson's playing is clean and melodic, but he really butchers the last three songs on the CD (the covers).If you are into these guitarist, you may enjoy this."
3,a reviewer from massachusetts,"SAME COVER,BUT NOT THE SAME MUSIC ON THE VIDEO!the solos,especially the solo for answers on the video was much better,camels night out was too.im not suprised that steve vai wrote kill the guy with the ball,here tried to upstage everybody else,(acted just like a high school bully)joe satriani was mediocre at best for him.but even with all of vai's lightning speed,and stage performance,silly hats etc..the only one who put out real music was eric johnson,who played nice pieces of music displaying real musicianship,and composition,without showing off.the quietest was loudest heard........"
2,(2 1/2 stars) A bit disappointing.,"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love Satriani and Johnson. I haven't seen Satch live but would love to. Johnson I have seen twice and he was great, as I expected. I've never been much of a Steve Vai fan and this album did nothing to change that, as his material I found the least entertaining. Having said all of that, there just isn't anything mindblowing here. Even the Satriani and Johnson songs are pretty standard. Don't get me wrong, it's great to hear them perform live, but I guess I expected something more. One of the best tracks on the album is ""Goin' Down"" which features all three guitarists. This is okay I guess, but any album by Satriani and Johnson will satisfy much, much more."
2,Terrible Kindle Edition,"You know if I pay [...] bucks for a kindle edition of a book, I think I can reasonably assume it will be legible. In this version there are rendering errors everywhere, titles in particular look like CAPTCHAS. There are absolutely no chapter markers or links. As a guide to learning it is un-usable. You'll see a reference to a figure and have to wait 5 pages to see it. Is it too much to ask for a little hyperlinking!Perhaps the print version is worth the price tag, but I'm angry as hell about the kindle edition. #fail"
3,Not bad but they were running out of new sounds,"Kill the real girls is an antagonistic attack on male society and a mix of techno-rock to boot. Def fx have always thrived on live performance, now they are gone this is your last chance."
4,Hard to find in the stores,Have had the mop for many years and have a hard time finding the replacement heads in stores. It's always a little bit of a puzzle how to get the head off on and on though.
3,Good buy!,This was worth the buy especially with Free shipping. I use this mop on my wood floors and i can squeeze it into all the tight spaces
3,Average book,"This book is fine for a broad overview of China. I did not go to Beijing or Shanghai, so I cannot comment on those sections. I visited the Southwest portions of China so I was honed into those sections of the book. I was amazed that the author thought Tiger Leaping Gorge is overrated?? Made me a bit wary of other recommendations in the sections!Another negative was the Mandarin characters were placed in the back so you had to cross-reference it. It may not seem like a big deal, but when you are in a hurry, it is very inconvenient.Due to the weight of this book, we did not take it with us. We were backpacking and found Lonely Planet's Southwest China better for the area (and our backs)."
2,So many shortcomings,"No doubt, it must be hard to write a guidebook for one of the world's largest countries but seriously, this book is not great at all. For cities, it's practically useless as it is very shallow. I also owned the Rough Guide to China until I left it at a hotel in Nanjing, but that book was so useful for Beijing (studied here for 3 months), Tibet, Sichuan, and Nanjing. My friend also had Lonely Planet's and that seemed better too. Frommer's is generally superb, but this book needs some work."
1,Way Overpriced,This digital/kindle/android book version is nothing like the good old paperback version in detail and depth of information. Its a highlevel summary at best. As a consequence for the price asked ($16) its way overpriced. Look elsewhere for detail information on China Travel.
5,Makes nails soooo strong and promotes healing!,This is an amazing oil!I have been using it for about 2 months every night and am only half way through the bottle. The oil promotes healing of my dry cuticles (which i have a very bad habit of picking) and strengthens my nails. I can't believe how long my nails are right now! i have had to clip my nails back instead of them breaking.I would HIGHLY recommend!!
4,GREAT TIMING!!,"Ordered Saturday and it arrived today (Monday)! I haven't been able to try it yet, but can't wait to do so. Only down side was that the box was damaged. The bottle was fine however. So no complaints!"
3,Could work better,I got this to complete a scrap book so I was using the dots to hold a variety of items. Half the time the dot's don't dispense and I have to pull them off the strip with my fingernails. The dots are very strong so that is great. I just wish the dispenser worked better.
2,Double click tick,"As part of a class, 5 of us were given these to use. At least 3 of the 5 of us had repeated problems with a single press of the Start/Stop button acting like a double click (Stop - Start) so the watch kept running.It was possible, with practice, to get a true single click on the Start/Stop button."
1,Cheap!,"This stopwatch is incredibly cheap and poor quality. The buttons are loose and placed in an awkard way. When using one hand, you have to put pressure on the light button to counter the press of the start-stop button. I often blind people across from me just trying to use the chrono function. Spend $10 more and get a quality stopwatch."
4,"Cheesy, but funny","When this item initially arrived, it was missing the wig component, but the seller was very helpful and friendly and sent a replacement out immediately. Also, even though I only paid for 3-5 day standard shipping, it was in my mailbox within 48 hours, so that was awesome! The beard will require a lot of tweaking to look anything like the picture. It is quite a bit thinner, the elastic straps that hold it on may need to be supplemented, and some double stick tape or latex costume adhesive are a must to get the mustache to stay in place. That said, it's a costume wig, and as such, it's fun. I certainly can't complain too much--just don't buy it for your church thinking that you'll be able to use it for years for an Easter/Passion Play. You should probably go ahead and spend more on something more professional. For a one or two time costume use, it's perfect. My husband is using it for a Viking costume, and if it survives, I'll reuse it at Halloween for a bearded lady look! ;-)"
3,It's okay,"The loops that go around your ears are very uncomfortable and irritated my ears, But it is of good quality material."
1,crappy wig,"wig is matted and twisted up, looks nothing like the picture. The beard is too uncomfortable to stand! But, I guess you get what you pay for, this is a cheap product so you cant expect much"
3,Wig and Beard Combo,This wig and beard combo was much nicer and fuller than the wig and beard that came with a costume of Jesus that we purchased for an Easter morning service. I thought the beard was too long to depict Jesus but that was an easy fix with a pair of scissors.
2,"buy ""On This Date"" instead","Kremer's ""Celebrate Today"" is an amateurish mess.Crummy clip art that's obviously several decades old...dumb made-up holidays, many of them redundant orself-promoting (to sell Kremer's other books)...and a '60s liberal slant in the selection of featured eventscombine to make this a frustrating and nearly unusable volume.Do yourself a favor and buy ""On This Date"" by Sandy Whiteleyinstead. It's a classy book that treats readers with respect.There's more usable material in one chapter of ""On This Date""than in Kremer's entire book."
4,Outstanding Detective Novel,"As an avid reader of `Detective Novels' I was given a pre-release copy of ""Dead Red"" by a close friend. I must admit I was kept on the edge of my seat as I turned the pages! The procedures the author lays out in this novel are OUTSTANDING! I guess every writer of detective novels should research their facts before writing. In the case of ""Dead Red,"" the author has first hand knowledge based on his experience in the field. I highly recommend all of you who like Detective type novels to pick up a copy of Nelson Andreu's new book."
4,CopShop Review,"Knowing Nelson cut no slack with me. I've been reading Cop books since a was a young guy. I'm used to the best, McBain, Cornwell, Wabaugh etc. But I honestly can state that the only reason that i didn't give it 5 stars was I was looking for the hook to the next crime scene in his next book. I guess I didn't want the bad guy caught yet!I actually went to an autospy with him a hundred years ago. It was a ""Crispy Critter"", a burn victim. Nelson was the best teacher on pointing out certain things to be noted that might be helpful in the investigation. Cool man, very cool.I'll bet the Miami cops miss him a bunch.Like I said no slack,I want another and soon!! Get going AndreuDennis WayneChief of CopShop.com"
4,Superb Detective Writing!,I picked up a copy of DEAD RED this weekend at the Miami Book Fair and am I glad I did. For the past few days I have been glued to the pages of this book. All I read are thriller/detective novels and this is one of the best I've ever read! You have to get this one!
5,Nelson Andreu's new book,"Having just finished reading ""Dead Red,"" I can honestly say the author has expertly used his homicide experience in writing this novel. It kept me reading late into the night for several days. This is a MUST READ!"
1,No Product,Never received my cookbook. It was to be a graduation gift. I waited and waited to full amount of time but it never came. I ended up getting a refund because the company did not have another copy to send me. Very disappointing. I was also unhappy that it took 4 days for someone to respond to my email about where my product was. I had to email them twice to get a response.
1,DISAPPOINTED,Bought this as a gift...paid over $30.00....was told it was new....Is yellow looking and the back of the book says it costs $16.95...Feel I got ripped off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Has me looking for his other releases!,"Fluid hip hop jams. Some radio standards others underground hits, seamlessly put together. Put in on and get ready have a party."
3,"NOT a ""Madonna"" DVD!","Sorry, but the title has some people fooled. This is one of the Asian Beauty series of DVDs, featuring another exquisite Japanese nude model - Madoka Ozawa. Granted, I found Ozawa far more toothsome in the nude than crusty old Madonna."
4,Game1 good game2 freezes,"D.K.1 is fun, entertaining and keeps you busy. It's an old game but very hip for its time. D.K.2 is more entertaining than the first game but it freezes too much. I have played it on different machines and it has the same issue. The best way to play it is to constantly save, once it crashes/freezes, reload and hope for the best."
4,Both Games Great but problems with DK2,"I loved the first game. I have actually bought it twice before, but lost them. When I saw this set I had to buy it again. The first game was great and runs fine when you backdate XP to 95 for it. However DK2 still has the CD copy protection and this made it huge pain to get to run. From what I had to go through, you basically have to crack the game in order to play it. The game is good even with the long load times and the mini movies inbetween games were sometimes hilarious. However, do be prepared to go through a few hoops to get it to run."
4,Badger sleep balm,This product smells good and I use it on my special needs daughter who sometimes have a hard time relaxing to fall asleep.
3,meh,"Bought this to help me sleep on our plane ride to Hungary and back. It was ok - it did have a relaxing smell, but other than that, couldn't say that it helped ""lull"" me to sleep. I will have to give it a try again in another setting other than a plane to see if it works better in other situations."
1,disappointing,"I've been having sleeping problems for a few months so I tried this product. It smells good however it doesn't last, I usually put on my lips and cupid's bow and after a few minutes the scent is gone. It did not help ""calm"" or ""peace"" my mind."
2,THIRD CLASS STUFF,"Elwes and Roberts are definitely going downhill in this production full of bad acting and cliches. The movie is a total failure since the beginning, wasting an interesting premise ( in the future - 2008 -, people would be free to sell their own lives ). Sorry...."
2,RACE AGAINST WHAT ?....,"Sad. Eric ROberts starred in some good movies, but this one is not one of them. It's definitely one of the worst movies ever produced. Why ? Because it contains only the worst cliches, bad acting. It has a good concept, but badly developed by the producers."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this worthless tome.,"I would've rated this book as a zero if that option had been available. I have to reiterate what some of the other reviewers have said about this book in that the organization and topic material is just a downright mess. The author probably has good intentions but strays from the subject matter to the poinbt of aggravation for the reader. The meat of the matter doesn't surface until way late after one has managed to read all of the preamble drivel. Nowhere is there a satisfying distillation or comprehensive delivery of even basic MIDI understanding. This book will leave newcomers to MIDI even more dazed and confused than before they started reading it. If you feel anything hitting you in the back of the head when you walk away from the cashier after purchasing this piece of junk, it's probably your change."
1,Grammatical Errors Galore,"The author seems to have meant well but, how is one supposed to take him serious when there are so many blatant grammatical errors? Words are used incorrectly and spelled wrong. Use a spell checker for crying out loud! As mentioned previously, there is good information but put together poorly. He does go on and on about gigastudio but, in his defense, it is the future of the industry."
5,Easy to read and understand,I am so excited that I found a music book that could help me with all the midi stuff. I needed somthing and this book is it. I gives you list and pictures of equipment that you could buy to make systems that work. It explains all the reasons for each piece of hardware and what their use is in the computer. For me it shows me how to buy the correct type and how much computer hardware. This book really has been great!
4,Good for learning MIDI 'under the hood',"Anyone can use midi to record music nowadays but this book goes into many technical details about how midi works. If you were setting up your own home recording studio - with no experience - this book would be essential. It is full of diagrams; not always strictly how-to, but gives you enough information to know how the hardware works/connects together and how the majority of common features in software function with MIDI. My only gripe with this book is that it has not been updated and probably never will be. The information regarding computer specs and software is severely outdated. If you need to learn how to connect and configure MIDI equipment, and start playing with it - this book will get you started."
4,It Brought Pleasure,This painting set was purchased for my elderly father. It was meant as something for him to do on those 100+ degree days of summer in Louisiana. His smile of pleasure was all I needed.
4,Worth the money,"I got this paint by number painting, and the portrait is large size and the results are beautiful! It comes with a paint brush, paints, and instuctions on how to paint the picture. The paints are arylic paints and the qulaity is life like. It's easy to do, and it's fun for a paint by number artist!"
5,Lots of Fun,"This is my first paint-by-numbers. I was a little concerned that it would be too advanced for me, but as long as you have patience it shouldn't be a problem. I find this really very relaxing after a long day in the office. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try something different and who wants some stress relief."
5,Detailed Paint by Number,"I purchased this particular paint by number for my 21 year old daughter's birthday along with even another paint by number. She hasn't started working on this particular set yet because she started on the other. So far, she is absolutely enjoying it and loves the detail. I told her that if she wanted to, she could paint over it a second time to make it a textured picture. I think she might take up my suggestion.I highly recommend this paint-by-number for most young adults and even elderly folks. Working this type of set produces a calming affect laced with pleasure. Go for it! Faith"
4,Paint by number art work,Got this for my wife as a hobby. She finished it very quickly and it came out great. Many of our friends come by and ask where we got it from and how much it was. They are shocked when the find out it is paint by number.
3,Paint doesn't cover the numbers,"I don't mind that it's an intricate painting with a lot of very small spaces. I really don't mind mixing the colors. My frustration is that the numbers & outlines are printed in a fairly dark brown, and the paint is on the thin side. Almost none of the colors cover the numbers. I have painted some of the light areas 4+ times and the numbers still show through. Since it's pretty intricate I didn't like having to paint many areas multiple times. The paint by numbers I remember from when I was a kid had light blue printing I believe. That would have been so much easier to cover. I'm surprised none of the other reviews mention this."
2,Paint was dried up,THe product is beautiful but some on the paints were dried up and unusable. I had to get creative mixing other color to try and match.
3,tight areas to paint,"It's my first paint by number, areas too small to get brush in. Maybe it's me,time for a new hobby."
2,Hard for Adult,"This was a gift to my sister, age 55. She had problems with where to place the paint with which numbers."
5,Green and GREAT,"This is a wonderful piece of art when finished. The only problem I had was with the foals tale... the rest was fun, easy and very nice to work with. The colors are a bit odd up close but from a distance it looks like a professional painting!"
5,Worth the money!!,"I painted this painting, and this painting is worth it! It is large size, and the paints are arylic. At first, it looked hard but when you see the painting board, it was very easy! It looks so life like, and it's fun to do, and I recommed this painting. :))"
3,a little large,"I am sure this is a exceptional product. However, I should have measured my cooktop before ordering the grill. It is just too big."
4,too big,i found the pan to big.(it takes 2 burners of my stove) the best part is nonstick and not too heavy. i like it
5,Best low tech in a long time!,"I have been a gadget junkie, an electric everything person. With a kitchen full of appliances I have decided to clear it out. I have control of the heat, beautiful grill marks and it is a breeze to clean. This pan was a PERFECT solution to the George Foreman that I never really believed was clean after use anyway. The pan grills everything from burgers to pounded chicken breasts without the fat. No nasty dip pan to forget either. Simply put, the one for me. BTW, I use gas, I cannot rate this product for electric stoves."
2,Pan is Thin. Comes in Unmarked Box & bizarrely shipped,"I wanted this pan to replace my well-worn Circulon grill pan.But this is disappointing. The pan is thin and light (compared to other Calphalon pans ... and to Circulon ones, too). It does not conduct heat as well as my Circulon pan (so it doesn't cook food well). And it warps under heat.The pan came in an unmarked, white box: not like other Calphalon plans are sold. Nor is it engraved or marked Calphalon. I think it is a grey-market product and not geniune Calphalon. B/c Calphalon comes in a box marked ""Calphalon"" and is engraved Calphalon on the handle and/or pan bottom. Calphalon is also better quality.The shipping was also bizarre. It came in a HUGE box. 15% of the box contained this product: the balance was empty. It is very wasteful shipping.I returned the pan (in a box 1/3 the size). Not recommended."
3,"Better than other grill pans I've used, but not Calphalon quality","I was very surprised that Calphalon put this pan out. There are not Calphalon markings on the pan or box, and there is not a steel bottom. Because there is not a steel bottom this pan will warp slightly under high heat. However, I own 2 other grill pans, both of which warp with heat due to the missing steel bottom. The pan is extremely large, much larger than I had expected. The hard-anodized surface is only mediocre quality. I've certainly used better, especially the pans put out by Anolon. Overall, I would recommend paying a lot more for a better quality pan, you'll probably be happier in the long run. However, since I only paid $15 for this, I can't complain too much."
1,Do not buy this Product,Has no Company Logo on Grill and paper placed w/Company name in side package. I have other product made by Calphalon and all have Company Logo on prodcut. I think this product is no good & chip. Not worth $15.00
1,Poor Quality - Do Not Purchase,"I purchased this grill pan to replace a Calphalon grill pan that was ruined in a move. This pan is NOT at all what I expected. As I still had the ruined pan, I was able to compare them side by side. The pan above does not have Calphalon printed any where on it (nor did the box). The pan is significantly lighter, not at all sturdy. The handle appears cheap, almost loose. The finish looks like it was scratch at the slightest touch. If you are looking for the quality typical of true Calphalon cookware, do not buy this. You need to search for Calphalon Uninson Grill Pan. I returned this as it appears to be a cheap knockoff even though it came with a Calphalon pamphlet."
1,what a mess!,"These bottles are just horrible, they leak like crazy, you have to be very careful when puttingit together, and as you can imagine is quite difficult with a hungry baby crying for food. I like the nipple, but the bottle is impossible for me to figure it out, 75% of teh time they leak. Waste of money."
3,"BPA Free, Many Parts, Son had Difficulty Using","GREAT that these are among the few bottles that are BPA Free! However, my son was unable to figure out how to use the unique nipples. Maybe we didn't try long enough. There are 5 pieces to each bottle to be cleaned (same, though, w/Born Free bottles which we now use) - if you don't get plastic liner in bottom tightly, these will leak."
2,Super Fussy!,I decided to try these bottles since they are BPA free and supposedly work like the Vent aire bottles. At first I thought they would be just fine but we experienced extreme fussiness and I was able to deduce that they made my son very unhappy. I'm not sure what the problem was he liked the nipples but for some reason every time I had him use those bottles he would get really upset afterwards.
5,Excellent product!!,This does it's job and I have bought a few of these as gifts for my fitness minded friends..
4,Great Buy for a Big Man,I would reccommend any one who is of a larger size to buy from this company because it is so hard to find these sizes in regular stores for a sauna suit. He loves it and works out in it on a daily basis.
2,Sauna suit,Good suit for women as advertised in the picture. Does not give the males the arm and leg room as other suits allow.
3,"Works GREAT, ""BUT""........","This suit works absolutely GREAT! You really sweat up a storm! The ""BUT"" is that it does rip easily for no reason! I chose this size suit so that it would be big and baggy on me and not rip easily. The arms ripped off within 4 days and all I did was use a treadmill. I am going to order 3 more (1 for me and 2 for friends) and I think I'm going to carefully duct tape all the seams (top and bottom) first before wearing."
4,Bell Fitness Cross Training Vinyl Suit,Item arrived promptley. Works great. I personally have to becareful not to tear it when stretching. So that may be a consideration when selecting your size.
1,Changed my mind,"I only got to wear the suit twice before the arm tore at the seam, and of course with a hole in the suit it does not work. I am a very disappointed customer. Yes, I know it was cheap but even cheap should have lasted more than 2 days.I stand corrected, every one makes mistakes. This company really stands by their product. As soon as I wrote the review, I was contacted and was sent a new suit. Now, I don't know about the rest of you but where I am concerned, that is real service. I will take a company that stands by it's product any day."
2,Cool Product but tears easily,"I bought this product and used it twice. I was very careful in putting it on and taking it off. It ripped on the third time using it. I'm buying a new one because it does make you sweat a lot, but I'm disappointed on how easily it ripped."
4,I sweat like crazy...,"My fiance and I decided to try out this suit, so I bought one for each. It works great, I sweat like crazy in it and when I take it off the suit drips with my sweat.The only negative is it easily rips. My fiance's pants ripped even though he was careful. Mine has not ripped yet (knock on wood).Suggestions: Carefully turn it inside out when you take it off, and let it dry in the shower. You can also wear it inside out as well. Be careful when you sit. Also, you can wear some thin long pants and a thing long sleeve shirt if you don't like the suit sticking to you."
3,Sweating to Suceed,"This is an awesome product. I purchased them for the family and although one of the pants ripped on the very first night (which was very disappointing), the product produced(s) an incredible amount of perspiration and makes you feel like you have had an incredible workout! I wish the ones that ripped would have lasted more than just for one wear, but the product does work!"
1,One time use-beware!,"I purchased this suit and was very excited about its potential. I figured I would be safe using it while doing my walking dvd. The first time was great. I was very pleased with my purchase. The sweat poured off of me. Recommendation: drink plenty of water during exercise with suit on. The second time I went to put on, the pants ripped. The suit is very fragile and thin. Be very careful putting on and taking off suit."
2,Crosby/Nash,"Their new album/cd is OK, a few good tunes but is not worth spending 19.99 for. It is sold as a 2 CD set, but the first cdcontains about 45 minutes of music and the 2nd cd has only 24 minutes. All of the combined music is less than 70 minutes which would fit on one CD. It should sell for a one cd price !!"
1,"Not good, not good at all !","Advance radio airplay with the first track got me to order this CD on its release date. Upon playing the album, it is the only decent track. They (Crosby and Nash) are clearly just collecting a paycheck from this very sub par set of songs and music. Nash particularly seems way past his ""use-by-date"".Some of the tracks are simply regurgitated clones of their stuff from 25 years ago, but nowhere near that good.If you are intersted in this album, listen to it all first before (probably not) buying it. Mine goes for a quarter at the wife's next garage sale."
1,Crosby Nash,"As I read the other customer reviews, I am extremely surprised at their positive nature. I think this double CD is junk. The first CD is acceptable; I would be able to forgive CN for this one. However, the second CD sounds like something they wrote in a weekend and recorded in a day. The only redemption for the second CD is that it's short (another rip off in reality). I bought this piece of music without hesitation as I relied on the quality of music I expected from this great duo. If I had listened to it first, I would not have wasted my money. Crosby and Nash, I am disappointed."
1,"It's Not Deja Vu All Over Again, Yogi","Crosby and Nash's latest attempt at music is really meant to be a lesson to those hanging onto their dreams...you'll know when it's time to hang it up. For C&N;, the time is now.Nothing on this disc excites you. As a contemporary, I can remember fondly the days when I waited for the next CSNY (or without Y) tune to play on the radio. Progressive Rock is what we called it; their latest effort is Regressive Crock.Do yourself a favor...buy Deja Vu all over again...you'll find more pleasure in it."
4,"Very,very good!","If you like singer/songwriter stuff a la Jackson Browne, James Taylor, and of course, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in all its permutations, this album is for you. It really is a CPR (Crosby's solo side band) album with Nash thrown in generously. If you liked the last CPR album ""Just like gravity"", this is very similar, and just as excelent. CPR members Jeff Pevar and James Raymond (Crosby's supremely talented son) reinvigorate and rejuvenate the Crosby/Nash duo with great playing, singing and songwriting (one reason why this album has no filler at 20 songs). Pevar and Raymond are now (summer 04) touring with CSN to great effect. In short: great playing, singing, beautiful recording. Mention must be made also of the great 70's rhytmn section of Lee Sklar and Russ Kunkel from all those great Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King, Warren Zevon, and Crosby/Nash albums from the 1970's."
4,Don't Listen to Dubthough,"Listen,Don't listen to people who slam this album. Take a listen to it before you buy it and decide for yourself. Don't take it from a guy who gives ANY Paul Anka album a better rating than this album. And people can say that Nash songs are ""banal"" all day long, but the truth of the matter is, Neil Young has pooped out songs ten times worse than anything on this cd and the same people insulting Nash have called it ice cream. Go figure."
3,"Fascinating subject, badly expressed","Pelikan is an admirable scholar who has fine concepts behind his soundly reasoned books. Unfortunately, his writing style slows and disheartens the reader. He has a genius for taking fascinating subjects and reducing them to boredom."
3,Covers the basics,Good book if you are only interested in the very basics. If you want a deck with any style - look elsewhere.
5,So cute!,"My sons love this song! (My husband and I like it, too.) If you have speakers for your computer, you can listen to it for free. I don't know if you can download it for free, but you can listen to it, anyway. Too cute!"
1,"""Throw you money out the window""","STAY AWAY! This CD quality is terrible, every song is short, it's worse then AM radio quality. Sounds like it was recorded in a tin shanty.I personally would have gotten more enjoyment throwing my money out the window. I wouldn't accept this CD for free.Go waste your money some where else!"
1,Fragile,"When I first bought my python water changer I was very happy with it. But after the second fitting in the sink attachment broke it got expensive. I looked up this problem and only wish I had read the other reviews more carefully. It's fragile and so on the second replacement I always kept a loop of hose on the sink to ease the strain on the weak part. Still it broke. You have to buy the whole faucet unit each time so 90% of the good parts are trashed in the end with the essential piece. Currently I am working on making a homemade version from instructions on the net. All told it's a decent concept with one piece turning it into a disposable, expensive and wasteful product.I have also noticed that two other companies are using similar units in their products. So use caution."
1,Not happy,Picture on this add makes it look like you're getting all the parts.. be careful! I was searching for the faucet adapter but ended up with the open/close valve!
2,Average,Average rock music does not separate itself from so many other CDs of its time. Disappointed but might listen several more times and give it another chance
4,Great edition,"Both of the Library of America editions of the Stein works are great- very well organized, nicely laid out, and include a great biographical section at the end. The only reason I give them 4 stars is I'm not a *huge* Stein fan. If you are, then pick these up- definitly the definitive collection to have."
4,Not bad for a cheap mini tripod,"I tried a couple flexible-leg mini tripods and I could never quite get those perfectly level. This tripod I can. And I like the feature where I can choose the height anywhere between 6"" with the legs NOT extended all the way up to 9"" fully extended (grab the rubber feet and pull to extend the legs). The directions don't say to do this, I had to figure it out on my own.Plus- and I know this is kind of strange - NO SMELL! I bought a flexible mini-tripod also made by Digipower a year ago and it still has that funky Chinese chemical smell. This Digipower is also made in China but no scent to it."
2,Flimsy construction,"The tripod is barely functional, because it is of such flimsy construction. Once when I used it on timer and was standing with the family in front of the camera, the movement of the shutter shook the tripod perceptibly and I was really concerned it would topple over, fortunately it did not. That was the last time I used it with my expensive camera.I now use it only to take photos for still items ( like for selling on Craigslist ) where I can put my hand on the tripod to keep it firm and steady. And I use my older, cheaper point & shoot cameras.The price was low, only about $5, but I should have spent a little more money and bought a better one instead."
2,Meh,"I only got this because it came free with my new Canon A3300 IS as a promotional deal. Reading the description, I thought that the legs would extend at least a little bit, but it really is only about 6 inches tall once the legs are opened. The camera sits on it just fine, but I doubt I will ever use it. If I have a table or surface tall enough to set it on, I will probably just lean on the surface and shoot rather than go through the hassle of getting the tripod out and screwing the camera onto it.It may prove useful if we decide to take some quick family portraits for Christmas cards or something, but unless you do a lot of that, I wouldn't waste your money."
2,Disappointed,"Hi,Although the price was right....I was very disappointed in the device. I had thought that it had telescoping legs - it does not. The product has far less functionality than what I thought was defined in the product features."
4,Funny,"This is a hilarious look at our country's leaders and their ""human side"". Mistakes are common place for most of us and our government has made a lot of big ones! A fast and easy read."
4,Easy reading.,"I'm not crazy about the format of this book, but it's an interesting skimmable ""bathroom reader"" sure to make you chuckle (sadly) at the state of things. Heard this author interviewed - very credible, interesting guy."
2,Great Government Goofs seams biased,"I actually bought this book for my husband, because he likes the bathroom reader books and he is heavily into FOX News. What I read of it, seams as if they are biased against the Republicans, so it totally turned me off and I doubt my husband will like it either. Really disappointed. They should have had one Demo goof to one Rep goof."
5,One of the great books,"This is one of the great books. Way better in French. Unfortunately almost all English translations are horribly edited, mistranslated (especially the engineering calculations) and bowlderized, frequently leaving out half or more of the text! For instance, the title is not ""20,000 Under.."" as in ""20,000 Deep"", but as in ""Distance Travelled"" - once around the world i.e ""20,000 Leagues under the Seas"".Also is seems to be rarely noted that it is the first half of a two-part series. The second volume is ""L'le mystérieuse"" (Mysterious Island), and it contains answers to the mysteries left hanging from the first half."
2,Most of these stories are at a very low standard,"There are two stories worth reading in this anthology of supernatural Civil War-themed work: those by Collins and Somtow. (The latter is a depressing tale of race hatred, but at least it's well written.) One or two others are vaguely OK. The majority of them are awful. They are not written well; they are not researched well; they suck. The worst is probably Moorcock's surrealist nonsense, but Ballard's boring George Todd story, Wagner's silly cannibalism/undead tale and McCaffrey's sentimental plantation claptrap -- not to mention a plethora of Sherman's Bummers meet Zombies splatter -- just leave me bored. I'd recommend avoiding this."
1,A Waste for Real Ghost Enthusiasts,"This, along with the author's other Christmas ghost story book, is a complete waste of time and money for those who really enjoy classic, well-written ghost stories. These stories are primarily written for children or teens - the language and semantics are very elementary. Secondly, they are the ""sugar-coated"" type of story whereby there is always a happy ending. For example, an elderly mother whose son died before Christmas suddenly, and unexpectedly, finds a way to pay his debts. Ho-hum. After reading three of these boring and ridiculous pieces of dribble, I put the book away and didn't even bother with the other one. It makes one wonder just how desperate publishers are these days."
3,Enjoyable,"This book is very enjoyable with two to four year olds of our family;however, I was disappointed that Tonka was listed on every truck...and not real monster trucks that compete were highlighted....My fault I guess since I didn't realize it was a generic type book.The two year old in our family really enjoyed it, but our young four year old who is reading some now was disappointed not to enjoy a story with real trucks like Gravedigger/Eradicator/etc.I am searching now for a ""real monster jam book"" and I think he will enjoy it more.I would buy the book again though with more emphasis on the younger child."
3,Made a reader of my Grandson,My three year old Grandson loves anything with wheels on it. He has never been interested when I try to get him to look at a book while I read it to him. Now he is bringing this book to me and asking me to read to him. He has decided books can be fun too.
4,Short but Sweet,"This is a quick read, but with good illustrations. Unless a child is a reader, sounding out the words, you'll blow through this rather quickly. That can be ok for times when you need a quick distraction for a few minutes, waiting rooms, etc... Order the whole series to keep them busy for a while."
4,Better than Judgment at Nuremberg,"Aside from Alec Baldwin's somewhat laconic performance, this film is much better than the original Judgment at Nuremberg, in my opinion. Brian Cox is phenomenal as Goring and steals the show. Baldwin's only shining moment is his grilling of Goring in which he finally shows some emotion. As always, Jill Hennessy looks great, but her character here is useless fluff."
5,Nuremburg,"This is great movie with a compelling story to tell. Excellent performances by the actors make it that much more realistic. This is my second purchase of this DVD, I wore out the first one!"
1,Nuremberg,JUNK. Don't waste your time. It's 30 minutes into it before their even in the court room. Here's the stars in a suit here's Baldwin in another suit in a car. Here he is in yet another nicely tailored suit. Here is Max Van Sydow with a Florida tan and a tear jerker dialogue. JEEZ this was an insult to both film and history
2,It stinks,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those jagoffs who deny the Holocost and I didn't ever own this movie. I did however catch it on YouTube with Portugese subtitles or something and there were two things that really struck me. One, if this is some of the best stuff that came out of TV in the early 2000s then the quality of TV has skyrocketed. And two, they are doing a piss poor job of ripping off a far far far better movie made with far better actors called Judgement at Nuremburg. Whew. You want a legal thriller involving that time and place in the course of human events, go for that one. I like Alec Baldwin fine but half of this script seems forced and it doesn't seem to have any emotional content. It seems more like the Jewish producers in Hollywood tried to fulfill their Nazi movie quota for the year 2000. I know that sounds horrible but it left me with that impression for good or ill.Judgment at Nuremberg"
2,Poor Acting Talent,The movie wastes most of the time on court presentations with very little on background such as concentration camp or Nazi crimes etc. The guy who plays Judge Jackson is very self conscious and doesn't blend into the role. The only one who was any good was the guy who played Herman Goring.
4,Wonderful!,"Very interesting all the photos, the trial, and the fact that it focused on the individuals all involved. I was too young so do not remember what had happened at the trials and am not sure how accurate this film is but still a great movie. Never let us forget the horrors that occurred!"
5,Nuremburg- The Movie,"What a excellent movie. I first saw it on TNT a few years back. If you are expecting all gore and films of concentration camps don't buy this movie. There is one scene in the court room of actual footage. This film is about the politicking that went on during the trial, the change of questioning strategies to get the Nazi's to fess up to what they did and somewhat of a psychological profile of ""why"" these people did what they did. Excellent acting by all!!!!Greg"
4,OK,"We just cannot forget that this is a made-for-cable production, a TV production. With that in mind, the film is very nice, giving a general portrait of Nuremberg. Baldwin fives solid performances, but Goering ( Brian Cox ) steals the show. THe only flaw is: for a film that is 169 minutes long, the ""moral"" of the convicteds could have been more explored and analysed. Keitel and Jodl are almost totally forgotten !!! The real scenes from NAzi camps are amazing, really depressing."
5,"A album with all quality ""Jairo""","I have a 5 albums of Jairo (All songs in all alblums are the best). And this are a more espritualy. If you find a ""hidden"" real artists, you need buy this CD."
5,Fires inwrap the earthly globe,...yet Bruce is not consum'd. This album transcends the metal bondages with highest quality riffs and melodies that are the maideniest thing since maiden. Dickinson proves that he's matchless. This is pure POETRY... STEAL IT!
5,Amazing!,"This is an amazing record and its even better than anything Maiden have ever done. my top three songs on this record are ""Book Of Thel"" ""Jerusalem"" and ""Trumpets Of Jericho""."
5,Awesome! An unbelievably Heavy albumn!,"Amazing! I just heard this albumn and I'm totally blown away! Incredible! This is easily the best metal albumn in years! Every song is great! Iron Maiden is my favorite band, and now that Bruce and Adrian are back with them, I can hardly wait to hear the new Maiden! Again, if your looking for a great metal albumn, look no further; this is the one to buy! Absolutely The Best! Up the Irons!"
5,It Only Gets Better,This album is great. Bruce Dickinson solo efforts keep getting better. Can't wait to see what he's up to next... Get this one!
4,An excellent album,"very good album by Bruce once again. Its not like his masterpiece Accident of Birth , But it is one of the albums that you will like for sure. My favorite track Is The tower which is very heavy and has ans amazing guitar and sound. The album has very good production by Roy Z. It has a bass sound that you will love. All the compositions are great. The solos in the tracks are very melodic . It has all the facts that a great heavy metal album must have. this is not an average album i more better. A must for any guy who likes heavy metal."
5,BRUCE'S BEST SOLO,"Bruce Dickinson's reputation goes before him and his solo material demonstrates his breadth of skill and his depth of talent. While known for his frontman status in Iron Maiden, his solo material has always stood up and this album is the best work he has done since he began.The sound is hard, heavy and rich and the arrangements complex ."
5,This album is flawless.,"When I first bought this album, I was impressed by the depth and heaviness of the music. It turned out that this would also become my favorite album of all time. I definitely recommend anyone who hasn't heard Chemical Wedding to buy it. This is something you won't regret purchasing."
3,Bruce Dickinson:A Chemical Wedding,"I was told this album was great so I got it. I really liked his third one, Accident of Birth. I got this one and immediately put it in the CD player. From front to back, I was really let down by the lack of intent do make the album shine with the kind of music that Accident of Birth had done."
5,HOLY SHI*,"WOW, what a CD! Chemical Wedding is better than anything Iron Maiden has done with Blaze Bailey. This is just an incredible CD. Bruce hasnt lost a thing. He sounds great. Adrian Smith is just incredible on guitars. There seems to be some real magic between these two musicians. I can now see where the heart in Iron Maiden lies. There is not a bad cut on this CD. If you are a fan of Bruce era Iron Maiden,then you can not live without this CD....it is awesome. Buy this one now! Highly Recommended!"
3,Dickinson's done better...,"Unlike _Balls to Picasso_ (the first Dickinson album I owned), this album -- which is based on the works of William Blake -- just didn't do much for me. It features the addition of (then) former (and now current) Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith to the fold. The album has a very heavy and dark atmosphere to it, which is not entirely bad, but just doesn't interest me very much. A lot of the great melody found on _Balls to Picasso_ seems to be missing here, sacrificed for thicker and more aggressive and abrasive sounds with heavier distortion on the guitars. None-the-less, I did find a few of the songs to highly enjoyable (ie, the title-track). But I just found the album to be a little too homogenous on the whole, for my tastes. Perhaps this would be better appreciated by a bigger fan of more straight-up metal, but from my perspective I was not very impressed."
3,Awesome game but needs work,I really like the bass challenge but it tends to exit out completely during play. This gets really fustrating!
4,Fabulous Circus McGurkus!,"Dr. Seuss is on the loose once again as he imagines what it would be like to be in charge of the circus. Not just any circus, either--it's the Circus McGurkus! Young Morris McGurk makes grand plans to create the biggest and best circus ever, with the help of the unflappable Mr. Sneelock. Reading level for this book is 3rd grade."
5,From Childhood to Adulthood,"This is the one book I would not let my parents put down as a child and now with my first child on the way I have a new copy to read aloud to him. The book is a fabulous adventure that never gets old. If you need a reason other than the wonderful story and its characters, try challenging yourself to read it all the way through with out getting tounge-tied. My father never could!"
2,TX/RX Issues,"I got this as a xmas gift for me jeep, and have been having issues since day one. Shortly after installing it, I had it tuned to my 5' firestik antenna. It quit sending and receiving signal. It would power on, and all other controls work and function, just no sound. After emailing Midland about it, all they did was give me a return address, 4 weeks later I finally get it back. It was repaired, it was another one brand new. My second jeep trip out it fails again. Now Im waiting to hear back from them again! It doesnt do my any good to need a CB on the trails and have this one not work. If the next unit (that is if they ever replace it again) fails too, Im gonna scrap it and go with something else."
5,Midland CB,When My old CB went out I decided to try the midland. Nice clean look and works great when on the trails so I give it a full 5 star thumbs up and recommend it.
1,Midland Stinks,"This unit had an attractive price, so against the opinions of several CBers I bought it. It would not work right out of the box, It would power up, BUT NO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE capabililities. Rather than go throught the hassle of sending it back I took it to a very reputable CB repair shop with over 40 years of CB experience. After running up a $40 bill, was told that a major power component was non functional right from the factory. So much for Midland Quality Control. I placed the Midland 5001Z in the trash where it belongs and ended up buying a Cobra CB which I was told by friends to do in the first place, Midland had this one chance to impress me right out of the box and failed miserably. Midland....YOU STINK."
4,Roger Fry,"This biography is written by one of the best writers of the 20th century and concerns one of the most influential art critics of visual art. Roger Fry loved traditional Italian art and was converted through a very gradual and natural process to become an advocate for modern art. Roger Fry came to see and apprecaite his contemporaries in visual art as making and having made important contributions. Time has proved Roger Fry correct and his critics wrong. Who among us doesn't not know that van Gogh, Gaugain and Cezanne are important artists? Virginia Woolf is a perceptive and excellent writer. This is her only bow to biography. It is a pleasure to read about a significant personality written by such a good writer."
5,Good Manga,"This book was favorably reviewed in Nikkei, the Wall Street journal of Japan. Very seldom they review boks not written in Japanese. This book is an exception. It is as skillful as the best manga and as easy to follow. The author understands Japanese business and other culture. He just does not speak in typical cliches. He assembles the facts, very many of them, and present why Japan must change and will change. He shows a deep knowledge of Japanese history but like the Economist magazine, he can use that and his English well to make his point. Sorry my English is not so good as his but buy his book and find out for yourself."
5,An Enjoyable Read,"I bought this book at Narita Airport to read on the way back to Tel Aviv. It was perfect: informative, incisive and a joy to read. Someone else here said that the style was like The Economist. I can only concur. If you like The Economist, you will like this book. Both are products of the best of British education. Recommended!"
5,Very Good and Enjoyable,This boook was very good. Prof hayes have the ability to make the complex thing simple. Our company deals with Japan all the time. Now I understand Japan better. We need more books like this - Japan made simple books that is.
1,A compilation of random facts,"Seldom have I read a book containing more random facts than this thin piece of ""work"". Explaining why the world's second biggest economy is faltering can not be done in 200 pages, especially this when writing with a total disregard for Japanese culture and a different way of thinking. The facts are additionally randomly compiled together, so picking up a manga while in Tokyo can probably provide the same economic insight as this ""book""."
5,He knows Japan very well.,This is the best book by a gaijin on Japan. Most of them only write rubbish or what they think the Japanese want to hear. Prof Declan does not do that. He explain what Japan's problems are and what we must do to solve them. I got this book as a present but now i went out and bought another copy. You should do the same if you want to know about Japan.
2,"Interesting plot, but appallingly written","Mr. Sellars is in dire need of an editor, and his publisher is in desperate need of a proofreader. This ploddingly written murder mystery is overflowing with unconscionable typographical errors, most irritatingly ""it's"" for ""its."" Mr. Sellars' characters do not *say* anything. They reply, they muse, they puzzle, they query, they expound, they express, they intone. Word to the author: there's not a thing wrong with the word ""said."" Honest."
4,Magical!,"When I was a kid, a friend of the family would sit with us around the bonfire and tell us the most amazing stories. This is how I felt while reading this book! I thoroughly enjoyed every page! This is an author that knows how to tell us a good tale! I liked that he included factual information on paganism, yet was able to sensationalize where needed! I must say that I got so involved in the story of it, that I had to actually go back and reread to search for the things that the nay-sayers were busy complaining about. A response to those folks....sometimes we must forget what we were taught in English class and go along for the ride!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"I enjoyed this book very much. The characters and situations were so real, it kept me reading until I had neglected my dog, my cat and my spouse. Having spent some time in St. Louis, I felt the locations were familiar (although he fictionalized some of them) and that sucked me in even more. I definately would recommend it."
2,Harm none - A Rowen Gran Investigation,"I cannot believe someone gave this book five stars. Based on the high reviews I ordered the series, but the smug self-importance of the main character made the book nearly unreadable. To top it off the mystery/investigation element was poorly ploted. After slogging through the first book I quickly consigned the rest to the library.The writer is not without skill. He just needs to get off his high horse and come up with a semi-feasable plot!"
