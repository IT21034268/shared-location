5,Great DVD+R,The DVD are great. I have had no complaints yet and the people that I made copies for have said they were very good. I have also use it to take a lot of pictures and documents off my computer and they have been great.TDK 16X DVD+R 100PK Spindle are great and the cost was great also.
4,Works But,I was able to record movies using My Magnavox DVD recorder but would Not play back on My Computer but could record data on My Computer. To record on My Magnavox DVD recorder then play back on My Computer I use DVD+RW
3,Good product - poor packing,"Good product,good price, terrible packing. Two 100 dvd spindles in a oversized box with some bubble wrap thrown over top of them. Spindle wrapping torn up - lucky disc not damaged."
2,Error prone,Random disks have errors - approx 10%. I have to add errorchecking to the recording sequence and dispose of one in ten.What a pain!
1,wasn't happy...,"product arrived in big box-but product was cut in half-discs were all over the box-shoulda used a bigger box-several discs were not recordable-due to packaging, if u are buying this many discs buy them in the store instead."
2,11 of 100 were flawed,"11 of the 100 disks in this package were visibly defective, with discoloration in large blotches across the surface. These 11 weren't recognized by any of the DVD drives on any of my computers. Unfortunately, I was in too much of a hurry to send them back, and just swallowed the loss of the 11 disks. The disks that remain work flawlessly in all my machines, however."
2,HORRIBLE PACKAGING!!!!,I was VERY disappointed with the packaging of my items. I opened the bottom of the box which had no packaging at all in it and one of the disk spindles had broken open. The box was very flimsy and had no rigidness to it. I have never had this problem with Newegg and only used Amazon due to the free shipping. Now I see why it was free. The product itself is very dependable and I will continue to use TDK DVDs but not from Amazon. I took pictures of the horrible packaging but the only place I could post them was the packaging review section. I will be paying for shipping from now on at Newegg. Goodbye Amazon. Get your act together!!!
1,Incorrect item sent...,"Ordered DVD+R discs but DVD-R discs were sent instead. Contacted seller, stated Fed-Ex would email return label to return item. Correct item could not be sent out until the incorrect item was rec'd by seller. Have not received any email or return label from Fed-Ex or seller. Poor customer service and will not order from again from seller."
5,Excellent,"My friends and I have our own small production studio and we've literally gone through hundreds of these. Out of all of them, only one ""coaster"". That's a heck of a good track record."
5,TDK is AOK!,"The requirements for my use are basic. I've been using TDK DVD's (and CD's for that matter) for several years. I've screwed some of 'em up but I've never had a defect. Cant ask for more than that! (Well, I probably could but I wouldn't get it...)"
4,good price...have been ok,I got these for about 22cents apiece. Have been good so far. A while back I had about 4 or 5 out of 100 that had obvious imperfections that had to be discarded. But just that once. Service and delivery were fine.I actually wanted to make this 5 stars but I couldnt select 5.
1,junk Plain and simple,"first stack I recived had the spindle broken and had 14 damaged disks the rest I started burning on rest,some burned at 16x most burned at 8x and out of 86 I had left I tossed about 20 from bad burns and this is from a new burner that burned flawlesly before this batchamazon sent me replacmemnt even thought I never asked for it and then asked me to send the fist batch back thought they send a prepayed return label it would of helped if the read I on the letter I send to inform them about the damage but I did not ask for a replacment and did tell that I was buring the good disks,so I got nothing to returnhopefuly they fix this issue as I not paying for somting I never ordered"
3,disappointed in last shipment,this last batch of dvd+r's i had almost of coasters and i always buy TDK i may wait a bit before i get this item again
1,It wasn't what I expected.,This coloring book wasn't what I expected or wanted. I thought it was going to be a coloring book where one would color the paintings in. It wasn't. I'm definitely not satisfied with it.
1,This book equates the civil rights movement with communism.,"I can't believe anyone could, in honest conscience, rate this book so highly as the Mormon sycophants that are crowding this page.At best, this book is good as historical reference. It illustrates quite well the mindset in 1969. Communist this, communist that - anything the author disapproves of is tied to a communist plot and is also considered ""unpatriotic."" Most startling is the author's opinion that the civil rights movement in the United States was backed by communists abroad in an attempt to disrupt our society.Benson may be gone, but his ideas remain and can be found on many a cable news program or A.M. radio station which labels honest dissenters as ""unpatriotic"" or ""terrorist sympathizers."""
4,Canned Heat Boogie,"Great cuts, great memories. Saw them in concert when 'Bears' arm was broken. They still put on a great show, from what I can remember (too much party). Tragic history involved, but a couple of the guys are still touring. Giving this CD a special place in music history."
5,Virtuosi by Burton & Ozone,VirtuosiI am thrilled with this CD. As a pianist myself I find Makoto Ozone's piano refreshing and exciting especially in combination with Gary Burton's vibraphone.After hearing track 11 played on Classic FM in Australia this CD is exactly what I expected. Thank your for your prompt serviceRegards Rose Harvey
1,Whatever happened to the old Makoto / Burton?,"1. I know people find this CD novel and inventive, but it's just boring... at least compared to Makoto's earlier work (many of which songs included Gary Burton and with Gary's group).2. Trust me, I have almost every Makoto album as well as Gary's Whiz Kid Era albums; this current stuff is just... canned material."
1,Skip it!!,"I was desperte for relief from the ringing, however I think Bio-Ear made things worse!!! Just save your money for the ENT!"
3,Not sure,"My Hubby tried this product a few times, but not as regularly as per instructions. He found no relief, but others might."
2,Does it Work?,"if it does, it is all in my head......... isn't that why i got in the first place? to take care of that noise in my head? At first it seemed to help but after several uses, nothing. The cotton balls in my ears helped block what the wife said, so that's why it gets a 2!"
2,No star review,"This might work for someone but it did nothing for me. I have nothing more to say.Amazon requires a star rating that I can't validate ,simply because the product did nothing useful for me."
5,Mystery and Romance,"This the the second of Ms. Collum's trilogy about the Addingtons. Unlike The Christmas Charm, this story has a bit of a mystery.The hero and heroine must join forces to keep their respective cousins from creating a scandal and find the Bath thief. A delightful read. Can't wait for the final book."
4,Met expectations,The item was received in plenty of time for Christmas. It is being enjoyed by my nephew. It is one of his favorite DVDs.
1,Not for ages under 4 or 5,"The animatics were too dated, and the story telling too slow....needs to be updated and more lively...perfect for children who know some of these stories and/ or how to read along"
1,Extremerly boring!!!!!,"I bought this for my 25 months old daughter as she loves to watch cartoons. But when i put this dvds she just refuse to watch, i tried a fews series but she just dont like any of them. She kept on saying mommy this dvd's ""NOT NICE"" i dont want them. My hubby also find this is the worst dvd ever, it is so boring.. Just cannot believe these are AWARD WINNING dvds.. non of us likes the dvds, i just wasted my money!!!!!"
3,New and Old,This disk set seems to have duplicates from the 1st set.It is much more compact because each cases houses 2 Disks of Movies.My 5 year old loves these stories.Better than traditional cartoons.
5,LOVE STORYBOOK TREASURES,"I have both sets. I love them. Great illustrations from the books and animations. Kids can watch some great books and also read a long too. You can choose to have the read along feature or not. Has 17 dvds and around 19 hours long altogether. Thora Birch, Abigail Breslin, Mia Farrow, Cyndi Lauper, John Lithgow, and more celebrities narrate. I put this on while my kids play its a lot better then a lot of the stuff on tv now a days so I just pop some of these dvds in and they can watch and learn from these great books."
1,Spring frame issues,"I bought this crib for my son a year ago. Used a Simmons crib mattress. The mattress became concave and the spring frame on the crib bowed also. After receiving a replacement spring frame we bought a Naturepedic 252 classic mattress only to discover that it is too big. Naturepedic told me that recently they've been hearing that their mattresses are having tight fits with davinci cribs as well as Pottery Barn and Ikea. I was told to try the Naturepedic 252 seamless because it MIGHT fit. Now I have to figure out if I should get new mattress or new crib. Wish I had known these issues earlier as it would have saved me a ton of time and money.Update: After contacting Million Dollar Baby, I found out the hanging brackets on the spring frame prevent a square corner crib mattress from laying flat on the spring frame. Since all of the Naturepedic mattresses have square corners, their mattresses will not work with this crib."
5,"DaVinci Emily 4 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, White",We (husband and I) sent our daughter about 10 different cribs and asked her to pick the one she liked best for our granddaughter and after reading BBB reports and comments on all the cribs she said that this was the better one. Well once it got set up our daughter loved it and she said that our granddaughter sleeps in it every night on her DaVinci mattress :) that her other grandparents sent her. Now we will begin to build her bedroom with the matching DaVinci Emily furniture!!!
4,Good Value!,"Nice product for the price. The assembly was not overly difficult, but it is definitely a project for two people."
4,Beautiful Crib,"This is a beautiful, sturdy crib. I bought it since I had the exact same model in white for my daughter and knew it was a heavy well made crib. It's easy to put together (I did it myself in about 45 min) and is SOLID. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it scratches VERY easily and the wood underneath is not the same color so the scratches stand out. I think it scratches worse than the white one I have and the few marks it had could be easily touched up with white paint. Other than that I highly recommend this crib and I would buy it again since the price was $100 LESS than I paid for my other crib and by far the cheapest I found anywhere. Great bargain!!"
3,Oak finish looks orange,"Our new crib arrived yesterday. I was pleased with how sturdy it is. Our old crib was wobbly and squeaked. This one seems solid and heavy. The style is nice, but the color is not at all what I expected. I ordered the honey oak color, and it is more of an orange shade than a light brown color that shows in the picture. I had hoped it would blend with the existing oak furniture in our baby's room, but it does not. Also, the wood is NOT real oak, and I wouldn't really describe the color as an oak finish either. This does not really match the other furniture in the baby's room, but our old crib was so bad that we had to go ahead and keep it."
4,"Love the crib, hate the upsell","We're happy with the crib. It made sense to us to get one that will last through the years. Even if we have another one (baby, that is), we'll use the toddler and full-size frames at some point or another. BUT, the full frame rails should be included. It's a pain in the butt that they don't and, IMO, a rip off that they're a hundred (extra) bucks.In the end, I'll probably just make my own. Not ideal, but it's a mixture of the principal and the money.That said, the item in question is a great crib/toddler bed combo for a good price. Maybe when baby outgrows the toddler bed I'll just make him sleep on the floor."
5,impressive,"Two hundred bucks seems very reasonable for this much solid wood, all of it well cut and drilled. The Emily went together without any trouble, though give yourself 1-2 hours. With respect to the guy who claims he did it in 25 minutes, that's possible if you've got help and have put them together before. By yourself it's trickier to keep components properly placed while getting them together. Give yourself time and do it right. You'll be pleased. It's very solid and looks great."
4,Lovely crib. Does scratch easily.,"This is a great crib at a great price. Assembly instructions could have been a little clearer but nothing unmanageable. It also does ding/scratch easily, so giving it 4 stars. The honey oak color is lovely."
5,great for the price!,"After shopping EVERYWHERE for a crib, and being really disappointed at the quality and prices out there, we ordered the Da Vinci Emily crib from Amazon. The product came in good shape with no bang ups from shipping. It was fairly easy to put together and we are very impressed with how solid it is. You really can't beat it for the price, we saw some that were similar that were selling for twice as much. We love it!"
4,...,"I bought this Crib for my 3 month old son. My wife said it arrived quickly and was in great shape! She put it together and says its good quality with the only probelm, being that is scratches easily."
2,Cheap materials,Made of soft wood that you can practically scratch with your nails.the fastening is also made of soft metal easy to cross thread.We bought the changing table as well and that is made of card board. It practically fell apart in about a year a a half I had to put it back together several times as the screws fall out of the soft wood/paper.I would NOT recommend it.
3,Would be great if we could get reliable parts to build,"We selected this crib based on the fact it has good reviews and is highly rated with Consumer Reports. The first one we received had a dent in the right side, so Amazon sent a replacement. The replacement arrived, just for us to find that the exact same piece is missing drill holes. It's such a shame because I think it's a beautiful piece of furniture for the nursery, but I'm amazed that we now have two cribs in our possession with all the parts, but still can't build it. I highly recommend checking every piece carefully when you receive it to make sure that there aren't any issues like we're having. To Amazon's credit, they have been pretty helpful working with us on this issue, but it's definitely been a frustrating experience that isn't over yet seeing as we're still without a built crib and we're working on ANOTHER replacement!"
5,Looks good and safe,It would have been very easy to assemble if I had a second person. It was tricky but not impossible to assemble alone (but I have some experience with these things). It looks great and seems very strong/sturdy. It's pretty big so don't plan on puting it by your bed or anything. I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it. The toddler rail seems like it would make it more difficult for him to escape but still not get in the way when you are bending down to pick him up.
4,Almost 5 stars,"The crib arrived in perfect condition, even though we moved after it was ordered and it had to be re-mailed. The crib is beautiful, it looks exactly as pictured, I couldn't go on about how great it looks as others already have, but I agree.So why write this review? I'm not sure if anyone pointed out the holes in the crib. Not literally holes that shouldn't be there but where the screws go in, there is a wide hole left where you can see the screws and it kind of takes away from the appearance of the crib. (Check out the picture)Otherwise it is a great crib and I plan on keeping it and using it as a regular sized bed frame when my baby gets to that point."
4,Great Crib,"I purchased this crib for my daughter in November 2009 and we love it! We ordered it in Espresso and the color is true, very pretty, rich brown. The only problems I have about it is that during assembly it got scratched up. It knicks and scratches easily and there no screw covers so they are exposed. But for the price and the fact it comes with the toddler rail (most cribs we looked at it was a separate purchase) it is a great crib. The different levels are awesome, I'm 5 '3 and I can get my daughter in and out easily. I would recommend this crib!"
5,A wonderful crib,"We got this crib about a month ago and while our baby isn't born yet I love it. It was easy to put together and looks great! Also my standard mattress I brought fits perfectly as I was quite worried by some of the other reviews it would not fit nice and snug and have hugh gabs around the sides, which is not the case at all. Only thing is be careful this crib can scratch easily but overall a wonderful crib for the cost! Oh and if you are worried about the rails and your baby getting stuck you can buy a protector for the pole which protects the crib and prevents your baby from sticking there head or arms thru the gapTrend-Lab Crib Wrap Rail Guard for Long Rail, Natural Fleece. I am very happy with our beautiful new crib!"
4,Solid,It is a very nice and elegant crib. It feels solid. The only complain I have is that most accesories for cribs do not fit this one due to the big wood frames it has.
5,DaVinci Emily Convertible baby Crib,"Sturdy, easy to assemble and looks great! Very happy with crib. The coffee color looks nice in our home"
5,Beautiful Crib!,Crib was easy to put together and looks even better in person. Very happy with this purchase.
4,A+ for sturdiness,"After researching tons of other cribs, we finally went with this one. It was shipped to our house within days and we put it together that night. The crib is very sturdy and beautiful! We went with the Oak color because we knew going into this that the soft wood would scratch easily. The only complaint my husband had was that is wasn't the easiest thing to put together, but not terribly hard either. If you buy this crib you will not be dissapointed."
2,Unnecessary space,"I purchased this crib for my grandchild and it has performed well until last evening. My grand daughter who is now 17 mos old got her leg wedged in the space between the top rail and the slats. Fortunately, my daughter heard her crying and went right in to check on her, and found her leg stuck in the space. It took both her mother and father to get her loose, and fortunately she did not injure her leg. I am shocked that more parents have not complained about this situation. I believe this space should be considered very dangerous as the child grows. This baby is not ready for the toddler bed conversion yet and I would like to know if there is some way to fix this crib to ensure this child's safety."
4,"Easy to assemble, sturdy","The crib arrived on time as promised. When we assembled it, it was surprisingly quick and easy. Once together, it's very sturdy."
4,"Good Crib, but soft wood","This is our second Emily crib, our 2.5yo is using hers as a toddler bed now. This natural color is a lot more prone to dings than the honey oak other one we have, I also wish it was a little deeper so climbing out wasn't as easy, but all in all, I have no complaints with this crib, would recommend to anyone."
5,EXCELLENT - BUY THIS CRIB,This is the most wonderful crib ever. It is very sturdy and easy to put together. I am extremely happy with the quality of this product. I have looked at this crib in many nursery stores but amazon.com had the crib priced significantly lower than the nursery stores and I received the item in about 2 weeks and they offered free shipping. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXCELLENT CRIB I SUGGEST BUYING THIS ONE. We bought this in the cherry finish and it is fantastic.
5,Beautiful Modern Crib,"I just received this crib last week and put it together this weekend. It was so easy to assemble, and is exactly what I was looking for. It is so good looking, and we have received lots of compliments on it already. Also, there were not any scratches or damage like some other reviewers have noted. I think a lot of it has to do with the way the shipping company treats the box, but it was all packed in really well."
5,"DaVinci Emily 4 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Ebony",This is the crib my daughter selected for her first child.It was more than she expected. It goes well in the nursery.We received it as scheduled. My daughter couldn't bemore pleased.
1,Don't take it apart!,"We purchased this crib 5 years ago and we have used it for two children. Like a number of other reviewers, our standard crib mattress was just a tad too small, but we used a thin bumper between the crib and the mattress and that filled the gap. It has been a decent crib for the most part - it was very sturdy and it held up to 30 pound toddlers jumping and so forth. I never felt uncomfortable with my children sleeping in this crib.The reason for the one star review is that this crib does not seem to be meant to be reassembled. A few weeks ago I had to disassemble the crib to move it to another room (it is much too wide to fit through standard doorways). I was not able to safely reassemble the crib - the screws would not thread. I would not recommend the crib for this reason."
3,Beautiful Piece..with flaws,I am really happy overall with my purchase of the Davinci Empi 4-in-1 Convertible Crib. It matches perfectly with the changing table (we opted for the drawer set) and seems to be very sturdy and well made. My only gripe (and the only reason this didn't get 5 stars) is that it came with digs in the wood. The main bar that goes across the front/top of the crib has a rather large dig taken out of it. It just seems like it got dinged pretty badly somewhere between manufacturing and getting to my home. It's not worth the hassle of returning the whole crib (since I would have to front the shipping..and we already put it together) BUT it would be nice not have a blemish on a brand new piece of furniture.
1,Wouldn't get again.,"Ordered this because I had the matching toddler bed (which I love) and it was delivered on time, and box was in good condition. Upon opening however, I noticed about 15-20 scratches, scuffs, and dents. Almost anything I buy now comes like that though, so I put it together anyway. It was going fine until the mattress spring had to be put on. The tabs that connect to the brackets were set too far away, so I had to press really hard to get it close enough to the frame to screw in, but I managed it, placed the crib in and went about my business. Two days later I heard a sound, and saw that because the mattress spring was pulling so hard it pulled the brackets right off the bed and the mattress fell through. THANK GOD the baby wasnt in it at the time. Had to send it back for a full refund. Will not buy again. Also, my two year old was climbing over the top and almost broke her arm when it got stuck between the top bars, which is a MAJOR concern. Left her bruised."
4,Not bad for the money,"This is a beautiful crib. My only critique is that the wood is very soft and chips easily and the bolts that the screws fit into are also easily stripped if you don't screw your screws in at the exact right angle. However, overall, this is a really nice crib and it looks beautiful in our daughter's bedroom."
4,great crib,"My wife and I love the crib. the only thing I noted is that the finish is not durable. other than that, the quality is good and the crib looks wonderful. I would purchase again based on the price and the excellent rating given by consumer reports."
5,Beautiful. Sturdy. Scratches pretty easily.,"We got this crib in ""Natural.""I've got to say, it's a beautiful crib that is pretty much the focal point in the nursery. It's sturdy, even if it does tend to scratch easily - the only thing I was tempted to deduct a star for.The fact that it's convertible... well, we haven't gotten quite that far yet, but it's very nice to know that we won't need to spend any more when the time comes."
5,Better Than I Expected After Reading Other Reviews,"This crib is beautiful and, for the price, you can't beat it! We did manage to get one scrape on it during assembly, but it was minor (If you're a prefectionist, you will probably want to put a baby-safe protecting coating on it). Amazon was also the best deal we could find- free shipping!"
3,"Very Nice Crib, But...","I have to start off by saying looks wise I love this crib. Clean lines, goes perfectly with any ""nursery look"" I just LOVE it. It is also quite sturdy. Now the bad part. It damages very, VERY easily. Since the wood is extremely soft the slightest bump nicks the wood. Once dented the lighter interior of the wood shows through. If you want to keep in perfect condition so that it can survive through all the stages it is meant for do not move a laundry basket past it or have any thing near it that can move. I have two boys, aside from my daughter who the crib is for, and the two year old loves to climb he can get into the crib in about 15 seconds if that much . The other crib I had took him a bit longer to get into. So as far as looks goes this is a great crib. Long term use may be hindered by the weaknesses of the wood, and if you have a climber in the family make sure they are never out of your sight."
3,One flaw,"Our son is now 18months old and this crib has been amazing. Yes I agree that it does scratch easily but it is solid and very sturdy. Our only complaint is that the front rail that curves out to the front of the crib has a gap just wide enough for our son to stick his arm into and get it stuck. Now that he is starting to try to put his leg over the crib it gets stuck in there too. We have since moved him to a toddler bed but the arm getting stuck has been an ongoing thing since he was alittle past 12 months old. Other than that we love the crib and plan on using it for all of our babies, though we may make our own alterations on it to prevent our 3 month old from going through the same thing with getting his arm stuck.If you do have this crib always remember to keep your monitor on and loud enough to where you can hear the cries if a little arm gets stuck."
1,One potentially BIG problem,"WARNING: when your toddler gets big enough/motivated enough to try to climb out of this crib on his own, his/her leg can get stuck between the top two rails. This happened to our little one at only 22 months of age. Fortunately, he was not strong enough yet to pull himself over the top or he might well have broken his leg. I think this is a major design flaw and the product should be recalled for this problem.Buyer beware!"
3,Check the brackets for a safety hazard,"There are four metal brackets that attach to each of the legs of this crib. Those brackets hold up the spring that's supposed to hold up the mattress (mattress not included). On the crib I bought, the pilot holes for one of the brackets were too big, and a good yank pulled the entire assembled bracket right out of the leg. Remember, the bracket ultimately holds up the baby! I happened to have slightly thicker screws that are holding the bracket securely now, but I was not impressed.So please make sure that your brackets are secure before you put your baby in this crib.Otherwise, the rest of the crib looks good, is finished well, and seems secure. But check those brackets."
4,Great,Just bought it. It was easy to assemble. It looks like it has good quality. Time will show whether it is built to last.
2,"crib is good, amazon distribution center not so good.",The crib came and moderately easy to install. The most inconvenient part of the installation was that this crib must have been returned by another customer who didn't know what he/she was doing because one of the screws was stripped. I couldn't easily return the product since it was 90% finished by the time we found the stripped screw. Amazon needs to do a better job with checking its inventory and not sending used crap to ppl.
5,Great company,"We've had this crib for about a year and a half....a metal piece on the spring frame snapped in half! I looked online to see if this happened to anyone else...nothing. I figured we had gotten a defective frame so I contacted the company. They are sending me a new one...taking the old one back for research so that this doesn't happen to anyone else. These things can happen to ANY product out there, but the way the company handled it was GREAT!!! I would, without reservation, buy from this company again!"
4,Great crib!!!,"Great crib!!! Looks great and have had no issues with it. Setup was a litle tricky, but definitely worth it."
5,beautiful crib,The DaVinci Emily crib is so beautiful and easy to put together.The crib was delivered very fast.
5,Beautiful,"I looked for months for my new twin girl grandchildren, along with my daughter, and for the price they are well worth it and extremely good looking when assembled."
4,Pretty and sturdy,I have had this crib for nearly a year. It has been through one move with no problems and I haven't had a problem with joints loosening or anything else. It is also light enough that I can easily move it. The two flaws with this crib are that it scratches VERY easily and that the sides come down very low so there is really no way to store anything under the bed. But overall I am quite happy with this crib. Recommended.
4,Beautiful Crib,"We researched cribs for a few months before narrowing it down to 3 choices. This was one of them and by far the cheapest, especially from this website. We received the crib one week after we ordered it (with free shipping). It took about 45 minutes to put together and is really a beautiful and sturdy crib. The only drawback I see is that the wood dents fairly easily. I hit one of the pieces against another piece when we were putting it together and it left a small but obvious indention in both pieces. But for the price, it's the best crib out there and I would definitely recommend it."
3,Not safe for a climbing toddler,Bought this for our 23 month old son who fit it perfectly before now. He is a little guy for his age but loves to climb. We noticed he uses his foot to stick it under the opening of the front rail and it gets stuck. I wonder if he was left alone his leg would get stuck. Going to write manufacture for now we have to figure out something else for him for the crib is already at the lowest setting. Finish chips easy.
5,Too good to be truth,"I still can't believe I bought this crib with less than $200. My husband just set both cribs up. It was as simple as ABC. I bought the white and black of it. The combination was great. I had a bloom dresser that is white and black and is looking great. I have dreamt of building a palace for my prince and princesses. My family plan was to move to our own house but we had little financial set back, so we had to squeeze the cribs and dresser into our own room. it really look great. But i know by the time we finally move to our new home. My dreams will come true. Thank you guys.However, there was no converting rail as advertised."
4,Davinci crib in GREY,"I am only giving this 4 stars because I haven't actually used the crib yet.The reason for my hasty review is to comment that the color for the GREY crib is much different than it appears here. Whereas the color appears very light on the pictures, it is actually a true grey (like an elephant or mouse?). I was VERY happy with this because I really wanted a darker color but settled for the Emily because of the reasonable price.It was shipped quickly and arrived nicely packaged. I wil try to update my review once I use it!"
2,Missing instruction and parts. Packing is not good,"Missing parts : (4)x Post rackets and (12)x wood screws 5/8"" in the package.Document: missing instruction . It is donwloaded from internet. Not sure instruction downloaded is most updated.Package is not packed carefully. Tape wrapping around box looks old."
2,made in china or taiwan,"I have been researching cribs extensively. There is alot of misinformation on the internet including information stating that Davinci cribs are made in the USA. Davinci cribs are made by the company Million Dollar Baby. I contacted MDB for information on where the cribs are built. Their response was as follows:"" Thank you for your interest in MDB. Our furniture in manufactured, under the highest standards in Taiwan and China. Please keep in mind, all juvenile products are required by federal law to abide by the rules of the CPSC in order for them to be sold to customer. All of our cribs are manufactures to comply with the federal guidelines and standards set forth by the CPSC, as well as the ASTM."" Unfortunately I purchased a Davinci mini crib prior to acquiring this information. I don't know that this company is any better that others who manufacture product in china."
3,not very happy,"the crib is pretty good, but when i was trying to put the crib together the holes in rear legs did not match. so i had to call the company and it took them almost 3 weeks to get the parts that i needed sent to me. to everyone out there i would not recommend buying things like furniture on the internet. i learned my lesson."
1,Buyer BE AWARE,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this collection, HOWEVER, it's one of those poorly labeled COPY-CONTROLLED cd's which means there is a high probability that it WILL NOT play on your cd player or pc/mac. It definitely WILL NOT play in your car system and you will have MAJOR PROBLEMS trying to rip the cd to put the tracks on your mp3 player. Read more about it here:http://www.fedge.net/emi/#whatisNow, the collection itself is fine, mediocre in reality, but if you're a nostalgia freak like myself you'll love it. If you enjoy remembering where you first where when you heard these songs more than the quality of the music/musicianship (c'mon, who really thinks 'buffalo stance' and 'gangsta lean' are wonderful songs, but they high on 'i remeber that!!!' value).But yeah, seriously think about the copy-control. And keep an eye out for it, it really isn't clearly labeled enough."
5,Excellent Changing Pad Cover!,This changing pad cover is so soft and washes very well. I use it all the time...taking it off just long enough to wash. It is so soft against my baby's skin. Well worth the $$!
5,Awesome Toy,We bought this for our girls for christmas and it is great. Very user friendly our 2 and 4yr old loved it and now that they are 3 and 5 still play with it. Great toy overall!!!
4,If only....,"I'd give most of the tracks on this album 3 stars - by in large they're nothing special. However, two or three tracks deserve about 10 stars. Specifically, ""Remember"" with Jan Johnston is in my top 5 songs of all time. Flaming June and Lullaby for Gaia (again with Jan Johnston) are also unforgettable. The rest of the tracks are good, but just don't seem as inspired to me."
4,Genius?,"This guy is so out there you almost start to think ""This music is just noise"" or ""He is a genius light years ahead of others"". I lean towards the second statement but sometimes his music is a little hard to ""get"". This music is not for putting on for a casual listen, background party music. This music is a journey, something that demands your attention. I think to commit yourself to it, one would ""get it"" on a whole different level."
3,"303, maybe a 909 and Drum Machines","BT does a good job combining trance, house, and drum n bass. Some songs are too predictable but does surprise occasionally. Lullaby is a good song with good vocals. - Dj NuYorkan Seoul"
3,"It works, sort of","I think you need to know what you're getting into before buying this CD. It's very ethereal - definitely not anywhere near Chemical Brothers-type stuff.The great thing about this genre - ambient, trance, whatever - is that there isn't that much of a precedent, so everything's going to be original. The bad thing is there's no precedent, so they are no standards. The creator can just run off into flights of fancy and expect you to follow, no questions asked. That's certainly true with ESCM, which gets very wrapped up in itself trying to evoke the ""transcendental"" mood.Makes good background music for a day spa, but hard to actively listen to. I like where he went with Movement in Still Life much better."
2,Electronic Easy Listening,"Do NOT get this CD if you are looking for anything with a beat, or any energy in it. The songs have a lot of slow, pulsing synths with some nature sounds mixed in. As a previous reviewer said, this definitely does not qualify as trance. It's much too slow for that, even for ""dream"" trance. It might be the kind of music the Gap would play over its loudspeakers.It'll make for decent background music, as it certainly won't distract me from what I'm doing. However, if I want to listen to music for the sake of listening to music, this CD certainly won't come to mind."
2,Valium 10 mgs,"For the most part this CD is really boring. I once bought the CD-single ""Flaming June"", and I was fascinated by this lush, energetic piece of ambient house. Finally, I decided to get the accompanying album, but that's just disappointing. Not even the extended version of ""Flaming June"" here stands up to the single version. The whole album is just overproduced and very inconsistent, with lots of senseless noise loops, bleeps, and clonks. There are flashes of brilliant melodies, but everything is very unfocused and chaotic. If you enjoyed this sort of techno, please check out Paul Van Dyke's releases."
2,This is NOT trance..... it is barely Electronic,"I don't know what these people are talking about. This is NOT trance. There are maybe 2 trance tracks, the rest is a mix of rock and (...). Not a good combination if you ask me.............Please do yourself a favor and immediately click the nearest link, as long as it is not the buy/purchase button."
2,Sadly dated,"This CD is sadly dated. It sounds about as cheesy to me now (2007, a decade from when the CD came out) as cheap pop music from 1987 sounded in 1997. There is older electronica out there which has not dated nearly as much- say, Sasha & Digweed's ""Northern Exposure"" (1996), which has a somewhat similar feel, or The Orb's ""Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld"" (1994), though that may be too experimental for some.I could see this being an OK intro to electronica for somebody who has listened to very little of it. If you have some electronica listening under your belt, stay away from this- it's a waste of your time and money."
4,Good collection for the price,This album tends to follow a historical timeline from oldest music to newest. The quality of the recordings is what you would expect from music this old. But it's a great collection and I think showcases Armstrong strongly.
5,Born Twiztid Juggalos Celebrate,Well one word can sum up my feelings for this video. P.H.A.T. Juggalos trust me on this.. If u got the skrilla go out and buy this thing.. Its the bomb.. From birth to today.. The story of Monoxide and Jamie as u have never seen b4.. Even has 2 videos and Gathering Of The Juggalos Footage.. SO gotta watch.. MCL Kevin
5,my reason for being a juGGalO,"Ive seen this mockumentary & i understand why im a juGGalO. Im glad I discovered Twiztid,I.c.p.......they R what music & entertainment R about......THE JUggALoS. the one reason too buy this and watch it over & over again 4 the 10 mins they tell us (juGGalOs) why they do what they do. not for the money, not for the fame...... FOR US ! so go buy it if you dont have it, if you have it watch it again a.s.a.p (but now would be better) L8s all juGGalOs"
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"I LOVED THIS BOOK SOOO MUCH!!! I went to the library one day and checked out this book. As soon as I started reading I could not put it down! It shows all kinds of teen topics, such as pregnancy, alcohol, parents, and most importantly, friendship!"
3,Lucy Peale is an unrealistic book,": Lucy, the daughter of a preacher, is seventeen, pregnant, andnave. Her father wants her to confess her sin in front of thecongregation but Lucy flees to Ocean City. Pregnant and alone Lucy meets Jake Jarret, a lifeguard, who takes her in. The two fall in love and decide to raise the baby. This book may only be suitable for high-schoolers only as it deals with teen pregnancy. I found this book to be somewhat unrealistic and that it made teen pregnancy out to be easy to handle."
5,Simply Superb!,"This is just a ""cool"" CD...so is the previous Urban Knights. Every artists adds a wonderful uniqueness that brings a tremendous sound to this CD. The ""togetherness"" of all the artists is to be comended. Great sound that exemplifies contempary jazz at its best. Looking forward to Urban Knights III."
5,Jazz Gal,"Well, I'm originally from CALIFORNIA and I saw NOTHING wrong with this CD. I had misplaced my Urban Knights III, I know, you're thinking...SHHHESSS..yah..well, I went and got this one and MANNN...it blew me away. I think it's cut 11 where it starts out like big band and then rips into a hip hoppy beat...I'm so there with that. That's my favorite cut. I put this CD in and before I know it, it's played over and over. I never get tired of listening to it."
4,Passionate Iceman,"This filmed version of one of the most famous of all American stage plays contains dynamite performances from Jason Robarts as Hickey, a jovial if drunken traveling salesman, and from a young Robert Redford as Don Parritt, the troubled son of a dogmatic and free-loving anarchist woman (who does not appear in the play). The character of Larry, an ex-anarchist philosopher, however, didn't reach its potential; Larry is arguably the most central character but seemed muted in this film. Most supporting actors, however, are excellent. The viewer should know that the presentation is somewhat reduced from the original 4-1/2 hour script. The black-and-white film and crude set enhance the passion of this tragic work by the tortured Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill fans who know the play well may be amused by a few errors in the actors' lines."
3,Slowly became a bore.,Depressing for the most part - went on too long to the point of being very boring in the final analysis.
5,Go straight to George Fukuhara story,"The George Fukuhara story was so incredible I read it a half dozen times. Why is this not a movie yet?This is a superb collection of personal narratives. You'll learn a lot about the war in the process of learning about these amazing individual stories. I'll return to this book again- and share with my pals, too."
3,13TH AIR FORCE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC,"THE FACT THAT THE 13TH AIR FORCE WAS WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK INDICATES THAT OLIVER NORTHS REFERENCES WERE FLAWED. I SERVED IN THE 13TH AIR FORCE AND FLEW B24'S ON MISSIONS TO RABAUL,BALIKAPAN, MINDINAO, LUZON, AND SEVERAL AGAINST THE JAPANESE FLEET. OUR LOSSES ON OUR BALIKAPAN RAIDS WERE AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT OF OUR AIR CRAFT AND CREWS. WE OPERATED FROM LEA NEW GUINEA AND ANOTHER ISLAND NOT MENTIONED "" MOROTAI"". OUR 307TH BOMB GROUP WILL HAVE THEIR EVERY TWO YEAR REUNION IN SEATTLE AUGUST 23, TO 26, 2006."
5,Very helpful,I purchased this mat to help me learn music. I am learning how to keyboard and having a quick reference sheet makes it very easy to learn fast and correctly. I recommend this purchase.
3,Nice compilation; Cheap materials - you get what you pay for.,"The chart is approximately 11x14 and has a concise collection of important musical concepts crammed into both sides. That is the good part. The bad: the laminating was cheap and flimsy.Also, it arrived packaged and rolled into a square ""tube"" which was slightly crushed on one end (I real tube probably wouldn't have collapsed as easily). Because the laminating is so thin, the paper within it (i.e., the chart) had already permanently creased in 2 spots (where the rolled end had been squashed).On the other hand, I was easily able to make a bunch of photocopies and I use those exlusively with my kids/students, saving the original laminated chart for future copies. In that sense, it was a wast to get because it's not sturdy enough to use/reuse (with eraseable markers, for e.g.) but it's more expensive than a plain-paper poster would have been."
3,Great review for newbie Piano Players,Nice large laminated sheet of piano notes and where they are on a typical piano keyboard. Has a few nice extras on timing which is so important in playing well. I would have given it more stars if it had been packaged better. Mine came folded in half and I am still trying to get it flat - guess I should mount it in a frame.
2,Many bugs,"Product looks neat but... Export and import to project is :-( Year 2000 bugs, dd/mm bug and many other , Wait to next version if you realy needs it"
1,Not the first and not the best.,"Firstly one correction - it is not the first such product! I have been using cyProj way before this product hit the market!I have played with both CSI Project and cyProj/cyStat and found the latter combination to be far superior in what it offers.Ease of use, functionality, depth of analysis, integration with MS Project 2000 and MS Project 2002 - all of these issues are items that swung my vote.Amazon unfortunately does not cater for the product and it will have to be purchased, as I did, from one of the PocketPC specialist sites."
4,Upbeat film from the Golden Age,"Very entertaining and light-hearted, and it's so enjoyable to watch the character actors' fascinating facial expressions. It's such a relief whenever I see a good movie that doesn't manipulate my emotions."
3,A lowcore sci-fi book,"i don't knoe exactlt what's the definition for hardcore science fiction book, i guss a hardcore is a book with complex story, ant lot's of unexplained science facts. this story is the inverse of this - the story is very plane - about some pilgrims on a new planet, and there is defently more fiction then science. basicly the book is very easy for read, and is told from the sight of a growing teen age girl. throught her eyes the story is being told, about her growing up, and the weired population that inhabit the planet. this story is not a thriller, so ther isn't much action, it's more like historic novell, but in the future, i missed the science parts - almost no science in this book, and of course i missed the action, and the thrill. basicly it's a nice story but not a great book."
5,Achieving the Impossible,"Lethem has attempted some very difficult goals in ""Girl in Landscape,"" but by and large he succeeds admirably.* Writing a believable 13-year old girl* Creating another habitable planet* Describing a non-human culture* Moving between a dream state and waking reality without the seams showingLethem is so deft in his tightrope act that I found myself exclaiming ""Wow"" aloud several times while reading. His skill is palpable, but the book never comes off as flashy or bragging.In fact, aside from a uncharacteristically weak dénouement, the book is nearly perfect."
3,Not too much to this book.,"This was my first Lethem book. I was drawn in by the inside flap... ""post-apocalyptic"" yes, please! ""sexual awakening"" oooooh fun, ""new planet"" interesting....Not what I had expected.This book is like bad haunted house, you go in exited, fumbling around in the dark not sure of what to make of anything, waiting for something thrilling to happen.... The excitement I felt in anticipation brought me more adrenaline than any actual plot point did.This is not to say I did not enjoy my time in the haunted house."
3,not the story for me.,"Letham still writes quite well, and his imagination still astounds, but I just didn't like this one that much. I just couldn't identify with any of the aspects of the story. I was never a girl coming of age having a power struggle with the adults around me, and I never lost a parent at a young age. I also was never froced to move very far away from home to someplace strange. I was never much of a spy as a child either. So in the end all I had was a odd landscape against which a fairly depressing story was staged. If you can identify with any of the above experiences you might like this book more than I did. I won't say it was bad, but I wish I hadn't shelled out hardcover price. (something I'd gladly do again for Amnesia moon)"
4,Lethem's fascinating,"I don't quite know how to rate Lethem's books. They're not like anything else I've read, but I find them fascinating. ""Girl in Landscape"" is the story of Pella Marsh, a young girl who's just lost her mother and is trying to learn to be a woman in a VERY strange new world. Lethem always finds an interesting way to look at the English language. In ""Motherless Brooklyn"", he used a 30-year-old orphan with Tourette's Syndrome as a narrator -- great book, by the way. In this book, he uses the ""Archbuilders"" - the ones who built the society on this new planet, but have since moved on - to explore the way our words often mean much more (or less) than we intend.Lethem's not for everyone, but you should try at least one of his genre-busting books, just to see what he can do."
1,Nothing like the original,"I have a substantial set of Desert Rose made in California that I inherited from a family member. My original set is absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is amazing. Each piece has wonderful details in both the texture of the ceramic and the hand painting.My original sugar bowl was broken and I bought this one to replace it. I wish I hadn't. This piece is made in China and is NOTHING like the original. The sugar bowl is bulbous and lacks the contours around the rim the original has. The ""rose"" on top is simply a blob. The painting lacks any kind of detail found in the original. When placed side by side to the original they don't even look like they are part of the same set. Save yourself the disappointment and look for an original replacement piece with a USA backstamp."
3,A Wonderful Story,"The book that I ordered is new, but this reprint from the original printing does not do the illustrations justice.I have a old hardback copy signed by the author/ illustrator and the pictures are more vibrant.It is still one of my favorite books and I gave it as a gift to grateful recipients."
1,I'm sure the STORY is good ... BUT ...,"reading it in this day and age is no easy task. My children were bored and all the ""thee""'s were getting to be quite annoying. We read a very wide range of children's literature - Thornton Burgess, Frances Hodgson Burnett, other classics, etc. But this one really didn't interest us at all. I was disappointed since I had heard such good things about it."
5,A Futurist Gem,"With great pleasure, I discovered such a complete book of Futurist Poetry. I appreciate the effort it went into compiling and carefully analyzing such a great and often bypassed period in Literary History. The Futurist were a major force and precursers to so many movements which came later that recieve more recognition. The introduction to this book and the essays are excellent pieces of writing which attempt to set the ""record"" straight. I recommend this book to all interested in the history of a great artistic movement which embraced all aspects of modern life. The Futurists were the avant-garde creating major changes in all aspects of life. This book finally shows their extensive works in poetry and places them in the proper light. It is refreshing to see Toronto Italian Studies Program take a major step in placing the Futurist in their appropriate place in History."
1,Mislabeled Product,I too wasted my time and ordered this product. It is clearly labeled as the 266MHz version. Instead I received the 333MHz version which will not work on my system. Now I'm waiting on a refund.
2,...Mobo but it is 333,"People, if you don't know anything about AMD cpus don't buy them. If you bought it live with it. Otherwise buy Intel and be happy with it."
1,Dry D is the wrong D,"I bought this and then my doctor told me I should be taking D3, and guess what. This is not D3, it's D2, and it turns out there are several kinds of Vitamin D, but the helpful one is D3. I wasted my money and don't know what to do with it now."
5,An underappreciated treasure,"If you can find this book, get it and enjoy it. It is a wonderful book about Mays, baseball, and the America in which he lived. It works as biography and baseball and history, delivering big in all ways."
5,Due out on dvd April 24th 2009 from VCI,"This is one weird and wicked movie about 70's teens wondering through a post apocalyptic world. VCI has announced a 1.85:1 widescreen anamorphic transfer that will blow previous releases away. The disc is rumored to have an interview with Jim McBride (the director) and a few other extras. If you like ""A Boy and His Dog"" you will love this film."
2,"Gritty, quirky and clunky",Glen and Randa is a 1970 film that was initially rated X for (gasp!) full frontal male nudity! Don't want people to see that male genitalia do we? Gosh no.The film has a slight amateurish feel to it at times. Sometimes the scenes end abruptly in a choppy fashion. Some scenes linger on way too long.Glen and Randa are a part of a group of holocaust survivors and decide to leave their group and wander on their own in search of one of the major cities in the US. What they find isn't what they expected.The acting isn't bad but leaves something to be desired. It isn't polished. At times I was completely absorbed in the story and at other times it almost felt like a bad sketch from Love American Style. It's very uneven!Watch it but be warned this is not top knotch film making here.
3,"Trim, too white!","Shoe was well made and comfortable, as are all Rockports, but the white rope trim was too white & bright. When I openedthe box, I thought the trim was covered & protected with paper. only to find that it was very white trim.For that reason alone, I returned."
3,Pompous,"I think these essays are pompous, overblown, self-conscious, and self-centered. The essays do not convey much information. They are exercises in writing, exercises in reading. I think an interesting idea for a book would be one that actually conveys some concept and understanding of Mexican culture to an outsider with an interest and sufficient familiarity to begin to understand. This is not that book."
5,Excellent essays. Stavans has a unique viewpoint...,"I loved these essays. Stavans is sharp, intelligent, uncompromising. His views on Cantinflas and Subcomandante Marcos are through-provoking and his piece on Sandra Cisneros finally placed her in the right perspective. A wonderful read!"
1,Very Disappointing,"The title of this book is extremely misleading. The majority of this book is not complex at all; building basic models would have been a more accurate name. Mortier fells less like a teacher of 3D, and more like a salesperson of plug-ins. Overall I felt insulted by this book which is too amateur for an intermediate user, and too confusing for a beginner."
1,Waste of money,"This book is for beginners. The title is extremely misleading, as there is no complexity at all to what author teaches. I also question the authors experience using this program. If you want to stunt your learning, and expose your mind to a gallery of medicore art then you will enjoy this. If you want to learn something about 3D, there are plenty of good 3D max books available. This one should really be called 'please buy my bad book.'"
2,Acceptable (bent),"This bent on a tough axle nut with a 15"" extender (about 200-300 ft-lbs). Granted, it took a 3/4 breaker with extension to loosen it, ultimately."
4,Did the Job,"I have had this tool for about two years and have used it many times. It is not the best tool, but it is a great tool for the price. I have put some major load on it and it still performs well. I have used it to break of stubborn stuff, using it with a 5 foot cheater bar."
2,German CDs,"This was not what I had hoped. I had wanted something that could be learned while driving, but this is not it. Might try to sell it on ebay."
1,what a book,"The book is not really exciting but it was all right. Sophia had a really bad attitude. Just because her maid was black don't mean she needs to treet her so badly. When Sophia's friends called her a ni**er lover it made me fell bad because I have black friends. I would have hit her in the head and said, ""just because I'm helping somebody out don't mean I love them."" Over all it was a pretty good book."
3,The Gods Laughed,I like the book but it was too short. I got tired of them saying they love each other. Way to short. I hope there's a sequel.
4,Clarion Call of Love,"""The Seagull"", heavy on symbolism and thwarted love in Bohemian rural Russia...why should we care? Because the play shows so clearly so many ways that human beings fail themselves and others. . . so many ways love is leaned on, and then expires...from abuse, misuse, overuse. . . and not understanding the true nature of loving.We should care because human beings still need lessons on love. Seeing ""The Seagull"" for me is a clarion call to loving just a little bit better.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"
3,Texhnolyze - Death & Serenity (Vol. 6) thoughts,This anime plunges into the heart of darkness that seems to be missing in a lot of the animes that seem to come out today! I just finished watching this final vol of the series and I have to say I DID NOT SEE THIS ENDING COMING AT ALL!! No I'm not going to tell you what happens but don't expect a happy ending.Although the series is all about the dark side of human nature A lot of the main Characters will have you pulling your hair out but if your into that sort of GIVE UP ON LIFE AND KILL YOURSELF NOW TYPE ANIMES Than maybe Texhnolyze is right up your alley but than again if your like me and sick of all the brain dead anime that never wants to make any sense and seems to want to pull into the debts of hell than might I recommend Ghost In A Shell Stand Alone Complex instead.
5,"Great Product, Great Price",Have used Verbatim and now these Memorex DVD's. I always burn at a 2.4 speed and haven't made any coasters yet with these DVD's and would definitely recommend them!
4,Work well,"I use SONY dual layer burner and this media works nicely. It would be nice if the media were printable, which it is not :("
4,Memorex Double layer,"It works fine, records what I intend to record. One disk did not work, but all the rest did."
3,they are perfect but expensive.,"I bought these to backup some valuables double layer dvd 9, like remind of crematory which I just don't want to compress. these are excellent for the job, very reliable and last a lot but, they are sooo expensive that I think twice for backup anything from music videos to movies, just considering his worthiness. in fact, if I don't have dvd9 to backup,I never consider bought these because they are so nasty expensive."
1,Terrible Product... Don't buy,"i purchased these disks and right out of the box 4 of them failed to burn, several more followed. I have only gotten one viable disk out of the package so far! If you want some nice coasters buy these, but otherwise, steer clear!"
1,DONT BUY- taking a chance,"others have left the same type of review. listen to them!don't purchase, they are awful.my computer stopped responding when i inserted a brand spanking new disc."
2,Just OK,These are just OK in my opinion--the burn speed is too slow to be really useful. No other problems with them though.
1,"Maybe they'll work, Maybe they won't","Apparently some people have no problem with these DVD's. I, however, have maybe gotten one to work out of maybe 9 or ten. The bottom line is that these DVD's simply do not work with every burner. Try another brand. I'm not saying that they work 100% of the time, but I will say that this brand has the highest rate of failure from what I've seen and experienced."
3,"Just OK, not worth the savings","I bought these Memorex because they were so much cheaper than the Verbatim. For me, a mistake. I knew it was a risk as all the reviews I read made this clear. But, I decided to gamble and it didn't work out. Out of 25 I had 7 coasters. Then I bought the Verbatim and got a 100% return. In the end, it was not worth the hassle and may have costs me more."
1,Not working for me,I get a spindle -but was able to successfully write only 3 discs from 10 so far. Others has been written but cannot be read afterwards.
3,At 5x the price per GB as single layer - not worth it!!!,"Even at this price (...),this is 5x the price per GB as single layer disks after rebate. When will those who set the prices recognize these WOULD sell like hot cakes if you bring them in line with normal storage prices! And they can even tack on an additional something small for the convenience but 5x the price -anyone would have to be crazy to buy these, unless they just had to - and that's all they are selling to is those who absolutely must buy them - a small pittance of the market! We all have dual layer burners now for a long time and we can't even use them, since its no where near cost effective."
2,28% failure rate on my Lite-On SOHW-1673S,"Completely unacceptable performance from a brand name I used to trust. Maybe it was a bad batch (batch number J6-08D02505301071A08)? I now use WinData discs that you can find at your local MicroCenter in 10-packs for $10, which work perfectly (zero failures)."
1,dvd dual layer 25 pack,the first couple of these worked like a charm and then i began to hit a streak of 5 dvd's that wouldn't burn at all. if you want to pay for a 25 pack and only get 6 out of it that work then this is the product for you.
1,Failure,The first time I tried this product I had a 80 percent burn rate. Decided to try it a second time. Unfortantely the second time yielded a 20 percent successful burn rate. Shutting down all my applications didn't help. Looks like quality control is terrible.
1,Very disappointed with Memorex DL,Using disks primarily for data backups on a Sony DRU-810A with the latest firmware and bundled Nero software. Was hoping to reduce the number of backup sets with increased capacity of Double-layer. However only 1 out of every 5 disks is good -- the others result in write errors. Have written hundreds of Single-layer Memorex disks on this drive flawlessly. I guess I'll stick with Single-layer discs for backups.
1,3 coasters and counting,"Save your money, for DVD dual layer back-up, these discs are not working, using a new Sony DRX-820ULT Dual Layer burner and Nero Burning ROM SE 6.6 which came bundled with the burner. The disc back-ups burn completely and ""successfully"" according to the software, but when you put them in a player to view, the video stutters and skips and freezes. I would not recommend these discs for DVD back-up."
4,If you have to make backups of your favorite movie...,and you don't want to lose any resolution you should get these. The bad thing is that it is only 2.4x which takes forever to burn.
5,Dual Layer DVD's,Memorex 8.5Gb dual layer DVD's are great.. I have used better then 1/2 the pack that I purchased and would but them again.. HOWEVER my problem is not witrh the DVD but the fact that when you BURN to dual layer if you do not have a DUAL layer reader you can not access data burnt to it.It may 'User Error' or it could simply be that the hardware that is needed to take advantage of this must be standered.. either way.. I am sticking with single layer DVD's so I can use it on all my systems.HOWEVER... if I ever do purchase any more Dual Layer's in the future Memorex is the brand I will go with it..You get what you pay for and for the price you get a heck of a lot with Memorex!
1,The worst product.,"The quality control over at memorex must be the worst ever. What a waste of money these were. I will stick to verbatim, no matter the cost."
1,Garbage,"Wow, a couple of these worked. The rest, uh, not so much. For information's sake, I use a Plextor 716UF and dell laptop. Tried Roxio and DVD Clone. They didn't work well on either. Since my unfortunate purchase I have read that Memorex uses the cheapest dye for their DL disks. It shows. I expected a much better (working) product from a name brand like Memorex. I bought some Verbatim DLs and they worked flawlessly."
2,Update: Works with Toast Titanium 6.1.1 on NEC 3520A.,Tried burning it on my Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop DVD burner using Nero 6.6.0.15. Burn fails 100 % of the time. Not sure if its media fault. Have ordered a NEC 3520A burner. Will try and update. Two stars for the price.Update..It works on my NEC 3520A as external DVD writer with Toast Titanium 6.1.1 on Powerbook G4 Mac OS X 10.3.9. 100%.
2,Must have been a bad batch,"From the 10 burns, 6 of the disc were bad. Must have been a bad batch of blanks."
2,Worthless when combined with a cheap burner,"I use a mediocre external burner and these disks would not work at all... I tried five and all failed. A friend has a new Macintosh laptop with a built-in burner, though, and they work fine for her. These are cheap and if your writing device is crumby, they might not work."
1,"LG H22N, Duo Core 2, 1GB, ALL non essential stuff shut down","STAY away... bought 50 of these on ebay... so far I have 3 costers out of 8.Not worth the time or agrivation. The $1 a disc, will waste 50min of your life. Buy better media."
1,zero stars,Memorex is crap. Absolute garbage. Fourteen of the twenty-five discs were un-burnable (on a 6 month old MacBook). I've heard of similar problems with Memorex but bought anyway because of the price. I won't ever again. Once I bought a 3 pack from an office supply store and 1 of the 3 was bad. I don't understand how Memorex can continue to get away with selling this junk! Don't be suckered by the price. Read the reviews here and elsewhere on the web.Have already bought Verbatim.
3,Compatibility Issue with Sony VAIO Laptop,I used these memorex DL-DVD+R with my UJ-832D drive and have had multiple power calibration errors (~40% of my burns). I would reccomend the Verbatim DVD+R DL; I have yet to encounter a writing error with them
1,Avoid buying these!,"Being a tech savvy person, with a new DL DVD drive, I was happy when these were buy one/get one at a local store, so I ended up with 2 packages.After 5 attempts, I have 5 coasters.Yes I have a dual layer burner.Yes I know how to burn them.These things are just AWFUL, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy them -- unless you want a few new sets of coasters, in which case, I'm sure Amazon has a great selection at a MUCH cheaper price."
2,Rebranded Ritek discs,"That's what Nero Info Tool says.High failure rate for me. I needed to burn 2 discs, had to use 5 discs to do so.These are the cheapest I could find, so there's still value."
1,silver was tarnish,"they send me a piece of junk. The silver part of the cord was so tarnish and it was rusted,how can they send me one looking like this? i ended up throwing it out. i have no time to send it back. i don't think i will be ordering from this vendor again."
2,Pretty to look at - Terrible to play.,"Simply put, this game has more bugs than the Amazon jungle. Basic bets, like craps place 6/8 for $6 pays $6 on this game, the odd are 6 pays 7; Unable to make place bets on craps working or off, etc. I sent Phantom a laundry list of their issues and was informed that nothing is wrong with the game.Moral of the story, this company is based in Iowa. They clearly have no clue about casino gaming rules. I suggest they stick with corn and soybeans, and everybody else find a program that is accurate to the rules of the games."
5,Impressive,"Train Simulator takes the obsessive realism of Microsoft's best-of-breed Flight Simulator games down to earth and brings the power and excitement of some of the world's most famous trains to your PC, placing you in the role of engineer or passenger with unprecedented realism, exciting real-world rail challenges, and the tools to recreate almost any railroad experience in the world.Released by Ubisoft, this game has hundreds of accurately recreated miles of scenery on three continents, real-world train operations from novice to expert, and gives you the ability to create your own trains as well as create your own routes and activities.Experience the fun of your own train line. This authentic sim provides railroad thrills. All aboard for the sights and sounds of real trains."
1,Quicken Expensable,"I purchased this product about 2 1/2 months ago and found that it would not install onto my Compaq Ipaq. I have contacted the company that developed it, who informed me that they no longer deal with this product and gave me an e-mail for the company that has tacken it over. I contacted them and never heard from them. Since it never installed at all I find this product to be lousy and it was a total waste of money. I was considering upgrading to Quicken 2001, but since Quicken's name is on Quicken Expensable, I will stay with my older version. Disgusted and frustrated."
3,Good,"These TDK DVDs are always on sale (around $9 to $12), so the price enticed me to purchase and try them out.I have an 8x DVD burner, so I was surprised when these TDK DVD+Rs burned at a maximum of only 4x, which is considerably slower. I've checked with an expert, and they've told me it's about the compatibility of the DVD media with the DVD drive being used. So obviously the TDK DVDs aren't compatible with all drives, and you may end up burning a disc at slow speeds like me. The surface of the discs have a grey color to it, which I like very much. Markers used to write on it really stand out, especially colored ones.I have had no other problems with these discs. Everything I have burned onto them turned out great, with no errors or skipping of any kind. If it weren't for the slow burning speed, I would absolutely be a lifelong TDK user. Let's hope they produce better versions soon!"
1,TDK DVD+R Totally undependable,"These disks are, without question the worst disks I've ever used. I have almost a zero failure rate with any other brand, but these disks have nearly a 100% failure rate. Out of the 32 disks I've used only 1 was able to complete. It is during the closing out process that suddenly it can't be read. Avoid these things at all cost. The small savings is not really saving you anything."
1,A DVD that doesn't burn into a DVD,"I tried on multiple occassions, using two seperate computers, several programs and I could not get ONE simple DVD made which took hours. I've had computer since the 1980's and am an expert user of software. I think these may work data discs, I didn't try that, but as far as burning a DVD is concerned these DVD-R's are garbage. I ordered another brand - Verbatim - which is another reasonably priced DVD-R and had no issues whatsover. The first disc burned as it should, and I made several copies after that. I would highly suggest buying another product."
5,TDK 4.7 GByte Discs,"We have purchased over five hundred of these in the past couple of years. They are great discs. Of that number, we have had only about five turn out to be bad."
5,Great value,"This is the best value product - excellent for longterm storage for movies, photos and other valuable material."
5,it's great and it's free,this game is great but the important thing any prospective buyer should know is that it's now completely free. the distributing company went out of the business and the author opted to make it freeware. and anything free is just that much better. just search online you'll find it.
4,not to bad,the car is so cool but it has only one problem the batteries they take a long time to charge and it runs out quikly
5,"Great compilation of ""accessible"" part of impulse years","This record contains some of Coltrane's most beautiful work, such as Alabama, Dear Lord, After the Rain, Naima (live), and works exceedingly well as a one-disc collection of the Impulse years. I have over 20 Coltrane cd's, and I still find myself pulling out this one as much as any. It is worth getting, especially since it can be had for ... . If you wish to get someone a 'Trane record, this is a good one to start with."
3,"Good reference, but it's getting old","The book is good reference, but it needs an update to reflect the new attacks and it is totally lacking in the XSS department."
4,Solid Book,"One of my professors is a security professional and recommended this book for me. To be honest, it doesn't cover material from a beginners point of view and would be poor for anyone without a fair background in the material.However, as this is a reference book, I would rank this in the top few books in my library for security. Concise, diverse, and quick to pick up and review."
5,Amazing Sub,"Its so powerful and light that when used in the downfiring position it walks! I don't want to use the included spikes due to floor damage. The power cord will sometime come loose as well but the sub is amazing, so much detail and power in a little package. Well worth the money!!"
5,Seriously thinking about getting one more Dynamo,"Typically, the smaller the sub the less capable it is, or you have to pay a lot of money for high-end small subs. The Dynamo somewhat defies this rule. I paid [...] for this sub at a Black Friday sale 3 years ago. It has been one of my best AV purchases. The bass is silky smooth, punchy and deep. How does it compare to similarly priced subs? I had an opportunity to listen to an HSU sub and chose the Dynamo over that sub. Once in a while you will hear from people who don't even own this sub saying that it is only good for music and not for movies. Well I am telling you it is great for both music and movies. It's a bargain [...].Additional thought: a great sub will sound like crap in the wrong location; it really pays to set up your sub properly; it took me a week to find the best location for my Dynamo."
5,Out of the box ...... Awesome !!,I Love the game and I have never thought of baseball in this way . I highly recommend this book to anyone that thinks they know everything about the game and the people that played it.It has changed me for ever.I also recommend visiting Mr Russo's web site thats full of info and to continue to keep your interested and captivatived...... Bravo....... I look forward to your next Book ...!!!! Thankyou Mike
5,A great read...a must buy,"This book is a fun read. I recommend it to anyone who loves baseball or is simply interested in good stories. Superbly researched, it's filled with so many rare tidbits they practically fall out of the book and on to the floor. Russo knows baseball and it shows in this work."
2,"Great idea, sloppy execution","I bought this book based on what I knew from the website. This really is a great idea, but I found the organization of the book to be pretty bad. Names aren't in alphabetical order within chapters, and there is no index. Some of the summaries are cursory at best and really don't have much to say. I agree with some previous reviewers who said there are some glaring omissions. One that comes to mind is Jimmy Foxx (unless I missed that one). If the author is going to complete a sequel (and I actually hope he does) he might want to consider better organization so that future researchers can more easily reference his extensive work."
1,A Strikeout,"This is slip-shod journalism at its worst. A compilation of poorly researched and badly written anecdotes sure to bore any baseball fan. I read almost anything baseball, but I can't stomach this trash!"
3,Great premise,"3.5 stars. I adored this book which I read several years before the movie Bruce Almighty came out. My first thought after seeing the movie was that despite its wonderful cast the movie is not nearly as interesting as the book, though I suppose the flick provides more laugh out loud moments. Far too many details that I found quite interesting in the book about the powers and limitations of temporarily being God were barely touched upon in the movie. But upon further research it seems that the movie is not an adaptation of this book after all, which in my opinion makes it a pretty blatant rip-off. If the author of Almighty Me did not make any money off of the movie Bruce Almighty and its sequel, he should definitely sue. As for the book, it is based on a fascinating concept and the smooth execution of its clever plot results in a memorable read."
3,Over priced and still missing 10 year old data,"This item is very expensive and only allows use on one(1) gps unit! I bought this to go with my Rino's and was very disappointed in the fact that I had to spend another $100+ to get maps, then to find out that it only works and 1 GPS and I had to spend another $100+ to get the second one installed was not fun.Once installed it doesn't have basic streets in my area that have been around for over 10 years! All in all I wish I could get a refund."
3,Planning Purpose,"I am using the product to plan my vacation in Georgia and northern Florida. Up to now, I am positively surprised about the comfort and details (POI) the software offers.The installation of the maps and the mapsource software and the registration was not so difficult as described by many people before.After my vacation I will rate the product once more and than with the real valuable stars...."
3,Ok...but,"I purchased the updated the Garmin City Navigator North America to replace a three year old version, hoping that road and highway changes would be on the new version. AFter considerable use from FL to KY to New England, I have found many errors. Many of these errors relate to road and highway changes made within the past several years. I should not have purchased the newer version, because from what I've experienced, it isn't any different than the three year old version."
1,Old inventory sell out,"I bought this product last week and it is the same old 2007 maps. Waste of money. And Garmin is selling 2010 maps, cheaper than this."
2,SMALL DETAIL,"I WAS LOOKING FOR MEXICO'S MAPS, AND I WAS ABOUT TO PURCHASE THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS ....""DETAILED MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO""...NONETHELESS UNDER THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT IT INCLUDES PUERTO RICO INSTEAD OF MEXICO. I AM A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF AMAZON AND WOULD JUST COMMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO SORT OUT THIS DISCREPANCY, WHICH I THINK IS CRITICAL. SINCE I NEEDED THE MEXICO MAP I ORDERED AN SD CARD WITH THE MAP IN IT...I HOPE IT'S MEXICO"
3,Can only be used on one device,"This is my first review ever. It is not for the software itself, but for Garmin's policy. I've been using City Navigator for 2 years on my eTrex Legend Cx, mostly when bicycling. I bought the DVD version for use on my computer. I also own Topo and Metroguide, but I like the auto-routing feature City Navigator provides when taking trips by car.My eTrex recently died and Garmin wants $90 to repair it. That's half the price of a new eTrex Legend HCx here on Amazon, so I opted to buy the upgrade. Turns out City Navigator can only be unlocked for one device (my dead eTrex), so now I have to purchase another copy if I want maps on my new device.So if your device becomes inoperable you have two choices: 1)pay Garmin to fix it or 2)by a new one AND new maps as well (an extra $100), i.e. every time you buy a new device you will have to re-purchase a new copy of City Navigator.I'm going to make due with Metroguide and Topo from now on since they don't have to be unlocked."
3,Accuracy wanting,Unlocking the software is impossible unless Garmin's website and computer responses are working properly. A call to their customer service line quickly solved that problem.Maps show roads that have long been closed as well as not showing ones that have been in place for years.Navigator is still better than the base maps or no maps at all.
2,Problem of no competition,"The only reason someone would buy this is because its the only software that works with Garmin GPS. Microsoft and Rand McNally mapping software are notably superior in ease of use, flexibility, cheaper, and over all better in function- but these do not work with Garmin GPs - so you are stuck with an inferior product."
3,slow delivery,It took a week and a half for it to show up. The tracking # showed it having arrived but it didn't show up for another three days. When it did arrive it was the wrong item. Got an RMA real quick.
1,waste of time,The software will not install. I started the installation process but it directed me to the website for an update. the update just hangs. I have emailed customer support but have not heard back from them.I wish I bought the Magellan unit
3,TSA and Garmin,"I can't review this product because the folks at TSA took my Garmin Oregon 450 apart at airport security, pushed all kinds of buttons and managed to uninstall all software. I guess body searches aren't enough! I can't rate the software because it wasn't available when I needed it."
4,Worth it,"This is the correct, and most recent, version. I have a eTrex Legend HCx and with these maps, the GPSr is now infinetly more useful.Installation was a snap, once I found the 8-digit coupon code (it is between the cardboard in the plastic clamshell). Just followed direction and it went right in. At the end of the installation a dialog did come up saying that there was an update, but there didn't actually seem to be an update.Downloading the maps to my GPSr was a breeze, once I figured out how to select the maps I wanted to install (I only wanted the West US right now).I would give this a 5, but the price it real high. Amazon has this a lot cheaper that Garmin, but still this software is expensive."
3,Garmin City Navigator v. 8,"I bought this updated version of the Mapsource software to use with my GPS (because that's all it supports). Still retails for quite a bit more than it's competitors so what can you do? The Graphics are the same as v.7 with no additional/different icons and the geocaching features that worked before I installed it, no longer work. (with the logging the find and putting it into the calendar) same as before. So over all it's the same old same old. I would be using something else if it worked with my GPS."
1,Don't Buy Garmin,"I bought a Garmin GPSmap 76CSx for bicycle touring, along with the MetroGuide USA map navigation software for building routes -- but the GPSmap wouldn't follow the routes I created using the MetroGuide software (among other things, it wanted me to bicycle across the Hudson River on water). When I spoke with Garmin, they told me that I needed City Navigator and not MetroGuide, so I bought City Navigator.It doesn't work any better than the MetroGuide did. On a recent trip, after carefully laying out a route on local roads in City Navigator and downloading it to the GPS, the GPS ignored the route I had downloaded and tried to get me ride a bike on Interstate 95."
1,Bad Customer Service from Garmin & Amazon on This Item,"If you want the latest version (2009 available since May elsewhere) buyer beware on this product. Amazon doesn't state the version so I contacted them today to ask. A simple question, right? Wrong. Happily I got through to somebody quickly at Amazon (India, of course) and the unhelpful lady said I would have to contact the manufacturer for that information. I pointed out that since Amazon was the seller, Amazon should know and so inform the customer. Besides, I had already tried to contact Garmin to ask if they knew what Amazon was selling (and what the upgrade policy was) and gave up after being on hold for 30 minutes. Pathetic, isn't it. Worse than Dell. Both companies in error here, and obviously not customer centric."
3,"Good Service, Troublesome Software",Item shipped promtly and arrived quickly.Had some issues with the software that once installed the program would have an error on start-up and fail. After 3 or 4 Uninstall/Reinstalls it worked great!Definately reccomend this over the Mini SD card version as this allows you to control the map on your computer and have future rights/access to it.
4,Don't Leave Home Without It!,"I purchased a memory card and City Navigator maps to use with my Garmin 276C. I had difficulty unlocking the Unlock Code. It took me, a computer technician, several hours to get the unlock to work. Now, the maps are much more detailed and useful. Been exploring many side roads on my motorcycle."
2,Okay only,"Compared to Google Maps, this product looks & acts dated. It might be at home with Windows 3.11. Not very well updated; a major freeway overpass/exit that has been in place for over a year didn't show on the map. Repeated tries updating has never found any updates. No dragging & dropping routes. Major landmarks not named, such as large community college. Expensive for outdated technology. Not worth the $."
3,Unmet possibilities,"For such an expensive piece of software there is more potential here than usable product. City Navigator does have included most roads that I'm interested in but has a really hard time with whether they are paved or not. Also most of the roads in my neck of the woods have numbers on the signs designating what you're driving on. City Navigator uses names for the most part. Since they like named roads so much you'd think that one could use their ""FIND"" function to look up a famous road. Well, you'd be wrong. Try the Blue Ridge Pkw. or the Great River Road and see what happens. What City Navigator does it does fairly well, it just doesn't do nearly enough.I waited until most pundits seemed in agreement that GPS was a well established product and then bought the ""best"" map for my hardware. I, maybe, should have waited"
3,"Maps are OK, but Unlock Process is a mess","I've worked with a lot of tech products before, but nothing this bad. Installation process is a poorly documented mess. Once I got it ""unlocked"" I still can get Mapsource to see it unlocked unless I""m logged in as administrator, which is a security flaw. I wrote customer service and never got a response back. Not even a screw you, just nothing. I guess that's the same thing.This is probably worth it, despite the awful service. I was using an open source map before. It was complete, but the attribute table was spotty, making search features run poorly. The maps are complete and work well with the unit. Find address and other features work much better. Routing performance is better too. This is much improved over open source. You get what you pay for, but I wish Garmin could get their act together on customer service."
3,Check Garmin Directly,Map prices have been coming down lately. Check Garmin's web site directly. You may get a better price and the latest maps as well.
4,Great upgrade.,"Great upgrade for my Garmin Montana 600, but have to say I sort of wish the device could've come pre-loaded with this software instead of having to buy it."
5,Garmin City Navigator North America,"This software combined with the Garmin EtrexHC makes planning new routes simple. For the map reading challemged, it means less time wondering where you are!"
4,Good Maps,"Once maps were installed, always a bit tricky with Garmin maps, they are top quality. It would be nice to be able to use the same maps on two gps."
2,don't buy if you want to wake up on time!,"We've had this clock for a year and a half--it's worked fine until last week, when for some reason the snooze button failed to work. I thought I had done something wrong, so I thought nothing of it at first. Well now my husband and I have both been late to work 3 times, thinking that we've hit a wrong button, even though we've never had a problem before. The snooze button blinks, says it's going to snooze for 10 minutes, and then the alarm never goes off again! I've never had an alarm clock malfunction in this way. I'm calling Sony today, and am very disappointed and upset about this mishap with their clock."
5,I love it!,"I think this radio clock completely meet my expectation.you can set the alarm aloud by using radio function, also set as buzz if you don't want to be waken up in a hurry.and also this clock can be a good radio to receive many channels, no different from an ordinary radio!"
3,The little clock that couldn't,"In the plus column, the radio on this alarm clock works extremely well. I live in the basement and have never been able to get radio reception down here until I got this clock.On the minus side, this alarm clock does not wake me with it's buzzer! The alarm is waaaay too quiet. The only other option is to turn the radio up all the way and let it wake you...violently.Overall, I'd say that this alarm clock is not suitable for heavy sleepers."
4,Very Pleased with Sony ICF-C318,"Did not think I would use dual alarm but found out it was a great asset. Controls easy to use and read-out large, easy to read, and not too bright. Radio sound is adequate, so only thing close to a negative. Being small and inexpensive, I still got more than I expected."
1,Truly a nerds product.,It is very complicated to use and cannot be set by obviously just looking at it. I am still reading instructions to set it. Very poor choice to buy and I would not recommend it to anybody. Also rather large in size.
3,Sony Clock Radio,"Good basic clock radio. The only thing I wish it had that my previous one had was settings for Weekend and Weekday. Once you set this one, it goes off every day unless you turn it off on the weekends and then remember to turn it back on Sunday night. I've gone back to using my old one for this reason but my old one doesn't reset for the updated Daylight Savings times so I keep the new one out as well. I would have rated this 5 stars if it had these settings. If you don't mind not having the settings, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it."
5,wonderful all ways around,"This is just what the doctor ordered. The unit looks smart, has great features, is easy to use. The sound quality is fine, considering the size and price of the unit."
5,Just what I wanted,"I needed an alarm that was reliable, but also not intrusive to my sleeping and this was that alarm clock. The dim light is awesome. I can tell the time when I need to and it doesn't light up my whole room like prior radios did.I don't have to block the clock with a sock now!"
4,Very Basic Alarm Clock,"The reason I bought this clock is my wife would accidentally turn of my alarm when she turned hers off, due to the fact the switches where so close together. Now that doesn't happen since they are on the opposite sides. That is the plus. The clock is very basic as far as options go. The buzzer alarm is horrible. I am not a real heavy sleeper but I don't trust it to wake me up. I have it set to radio with the volume most of the way up. I do this just in case the station is off the air, then the static will wake me up. Settings are very easy to navigate. It uses a fob battery instead of a 9volt. The clock has a time zone setting to automatically adjust the time. My Citizen Eco-Drive watch is extremely accurate to the last second and the alarm clock was a couple of minutes off, even with the auto adjust. It does keep accurate time now. For a budget alarm clock it works well. The buzzer is my only real complaint, and the dual alarm settings are a plus."
2,The display are tooooo dim!,"When I received this, I plugged it into the AC outlet and find only the radio working, I was thinking that this screen is broken and want it returned at first, but later on I find that the screen is working but the brightness is just toooooo low, even the brightest option is indiscernible in the my room that is full of sunlight that afternoon. Now I can only see the time in the evening, is this just me?"
2,Good design but plagued by issues,"I have bought two of these clock radios from Amazon, a white one and a black one. I really like the dual-alarms and the interface for setting the alarm. The main issue I had with both clock radios is that the radio would randomly come on by itself at night. Sometimes it was the actual radio, sometimes just a weird static sound. The sound would click on and off occasionally. Sometimes at a really low volume and sometimes at a louder volume. I threw the first one out and bought a second one because I liked the clock itself so much. But the second one started having the same problems after a few months. I will not buy a third!"
3,clock,"You can set two different alarm times. Which is nice. Too many buttons on it, though. Keep it simple stupid are words I live by."
3,Works OK I guess,"It works fine, but I don't really care for the controls. I've been using it for about 2 months now and I still have difficulty finding the slightly different ""alarm reset"" button when I am just waking up and haven't turned the lights on. My old alarm clock's reset button looks like a nipple, and that is easier to find. There are just too many buttons on the top.The clock has 3 brightness settings, but even the dimmest green is too bright for my preference.This would be better if it also had red numbers, atomic clock setting, adjustable snooze length, and easier controls.I will continue my quest for a ""perfect"" alarm clock."
5,SONY ICF-C318 double alarm clock radio,this is the GREATEST clock!! It has two alarms that stay set every night so you don't have to set them up nightly. You can keep the switch on and it will work in the morning. the two alarms can be set for separate times and used at the same time or I like to alternate my weekly morning time with weekend wake up times so Alarm A is set for the week and Alarm B is set for weekends. Once you set the clock for your time zone it changes automatically for the Standard and Daylight savings. Nice buzzer that starts three buzzes at a slow pace and then if you don't shut it off the buzzes go faster in groups of three.I love it!
4,"Great, Economical Product","Great product for the price. For the price, it has a number of customizable features, a practical size and a pleasant buzzer."
5,Just What i Expected,This is what i ordered i like it my kids like it my wife likes it the dog likes it.
5,Love,Great little clock radio. Easily programmable.Dual alarms are perfect for weekday/weekend settings. Very small. Brightness feature. Good price. Very satisfied.
2,"weak speaker, inaccruate timekeeping","i returned this. the speaker was crappy which wouldn't be a problem except the radio i was replacing, which is a 15 year old GE clock radio, had a bigger, fuller sound. i thought i was upgrading but i guess they made better stuff back then. And just like many other negative reviews the auto-time set was off 5 minutes. i don't see how an auto time set is a necessary function for a clock radio anyway, did that many people complain about having to manually set their clocks?"
5,Best alarm clock I've ever owned,"I bought this to replace my old Scientific American clock that was 10 years old. This clock is great. The alarm starts off slow so as not to startle you but progressively gets louder and faster the longer you let it go.The snooze button gives you the option to delay the alarm in 10 minute increments. So if you press it twice it will delay for 20 minutes, etc.The alarms are easy to set with the knobs on the sides. Instead of having to use 2 fingers to set the alarm, you just turn the dial in the direction you want to go.I understand this clock has other features but I only use the ones listed above. For the price I would pay it again for a good, reliable alarm clock."
4,Recommended,"I have been using for several months. works every morning, amazed that it came already set to the correct time. easy to use buttons. the numbers are bright and keeps me up at night, no big deal i turned it away and now have placed a light film of tint on it.I do recommend it for purchase."
4,Works nice.,"The only problem is that the alarm buzzer is not a buzzer, it a beep. Not loud at full volume. I've had an alarm watch that was louder"
4,Get's the job done!,"This seems to work fine. I would suggest using the radio mode to wake up by, as I find the alarm buzzer way to quite. The display is fine, & overall about what I would expect for a inexpensive radio. So far, so good."
1,Can not see the time in the daylight,"This clock is useless in the daylight. The display even at its highest brightness level is impossible to see unless you are within inches of it. Not at all suitable for anything other than a nightstand display where you don't want the brightness level to be high. I read many of the reviews and bought this clock in spite of others warning about the same problem. So, I have learned my lesson and add my warning to the others already given."
1,Time Flies,"From the beginning, this clock was four minutes fast and because it sets itself automatically, there was no way to make it right. So I adjusted to subtracting four minutes from the time whenever I cared to know what time it was. Then, apparently unaware that daylight saving time had been extended, it changed to standard time three weeks early. It was an epic struggle to get the thing to recognize daylight saving time earlier than it wanted and when I finally managed--more or less--the clock was seven minutes fast. Over the next several months it inched its way forward until it now runs 10 minutes fast. It also, for no apparent reason at all, hopped forward an hour one night and woke us up an hour later than we had planned. I'm finally giving up on this clock and looking for a new one but because of my experience with this ""automatic"" clock, I'm fearful of getting anything I'm not in full control of."
1,Do not buy,"The digital clock is very dark and can hardly be seen in the daylight. Other aspects are good, easy to use."
2,Problem,"This is a fine product except : Several times a night it emitts an odd noise, a bit like a "" barking dog "" . It does four of these "" barks "" then is quiet for 1 to 3 hrs then does it again and the volume seems to increase a bit, never very loud but just enough to awaken you. This happens 2 to 4 time a night, every night. I returned it for exchange and the new unit does the same thing. I installed two RFI chokes on the power cord but it didn't help and a web search didn't turn up anything. We seem to be the only two people in the world expienceing the problem. It's a bummer as we like the unit."
4,Fine but not what the giftee wanted,I bought the clock for a friend's birthday and we both liked it but it was too big for her bedside table and I had to return it.
2,OK but....,The display is way to dim to see in day light.You have to be up close to see it.the radio has poor quality sound
2,Who will it wake up?,"This is a nice, compact, easy to use alarm clock. My only problem with it is that the buzzer is so soft. Most of the time I sleep straight through the alarm, and it never wakes my husband. So now you might ask, ""why not use the radio setting on loud as the alarm?"" Well, because I will literally wake up when it goes off and then I can fall right back asleep despite the loud music - it's a result of growing up in the house I did. I have to have a buzzer and it is such a soft noise this one just won't work."
3,Sony dual alarm clock radio,"This a very useful clock, I love the dual alarm and the automatic time zone setting. The battery back up is a plus. I do not use the radio because the reception is terrible, but I really only wanted the alarm clock anyway."
5,Great Clock for the Money,This is a great clock for the money. The two alarms allow both my husband and I to get up when we need to without resetting it. Easy to use and the alarm isn't annoying as with other clocks.
2,"Thanks for losing me an hour, magic clock...","My 'expensive for an alarm clock because it automatically keeps time' set itself forward for daylight savings time 3 days early!!! I am a nursing student and every minute counts, thanks for losing an hour for me Sony!!!!"
4,like it but very quiet alarm,"I am a really light sleeper and was sick of getting jolted out of bed in the morning by my old alarm clock; I found this one and bought it because people said it has ""light sounding beeps"" that wake you up in the morning....this is true. Set on high the alarm beeps didn't wake me up. For the first time ever I slept through my alarm clock. However, I sleep with a big window fan on my floor to block out traffic noise so maybe that's why I didn't hear it. It's kind of a pain to set the alarm too. Other than that no complaints. Great for light sleepers I do not recommend this at all to anyone who sleeps ""normally"" and does not wake easily."
2,Works and sounds like SONY is not long for this world.,Do you remember SONY? I mean the old SONY. They would never sell this. It sounds mediocre and is hard to tune. Spend a few dollars more and be happy for the next few years.
4,Well worth the money,Pros - Easy to see the time. Easy to set alarms. Battery backup. Cons - low quality sound. Unusual battery for backup.
2,Puts out buzzing noise when plugged in,I really liked the look and function of this alarm clock and found it easy to set up but when we went to go to sleep and turned everything else off we could hear that it emitted a steady low humming noise that we couldn't handle and we returned it the next day.
4,Simple and efficient!,"This is a great clock. I do not want a lot of"" bells and whistles"", just a simple machine! This clock was super easy to use and comes with the time zones already programed. Just pick your zone and voila! I love the dual feature for weekends and naps. The radio works great, better than any other clock I have ever had. I am sensitive to too much light when I sleep and the ability to lower the setting is awesome. I have never had such a simple clock. When you set the alarm it advances in minutes up to 10 and then switches to 10 minute increments so it is quicker than other clocks. I am tempted to get another one because I like it so much. The only thing I do not like about this clock is the cord. It is thick and inflexible. When I turn the clock the way I want it to sit, the cord pulls it away. So no 5 stars as a result. Other than that it is great! (So far, anyway.)"
1,Way too complicated,"I was looking for a basic alarm clock and purchased quickly based on reviews. I hate it. It has too many features. If you want that, perhaps you'll like it. However, if you want a simple alarm clock, pass on this one."
2,Not the greatest design in clock radios,"While the automatic time set feature is nice, the controls for this clock radio are poorly designed and certainly not intuitive (and yes, my manual dexterity is very good). I have a couple of older Sony clock radios, which are SO easy to use, I really don't know what they were thinking with this one. Would definitely NOT purchase again."
3,"Does the job, but has one major flaw","There's a lot to love about this alarm clock:1. Big, visible face2. Two different alarm times, which are very easily adjusted with their own independent button panels3. radio alarm option, for those heavy sleepers like me who need that super-sonic blast to wake up4. attractive, quality constructionBut there's one major flaw that a lot of manufacturers just can't seem to get right: While you're reaching for your alarm clock in the dark to hit the snooze button, the ""radio"" button and other buttons are located directly next to the snooze button, meaning you can easily accidentally shut the alarm off or do something else unintentional when you are trying to hit the snooze.This is an unforgivable oversight, so I docked 2 stars."
2,Not my favorite one,"I have owned much better alarm clocks so maybe I am spoiled. So in a sleepy state from not adequately being pulled out of sleep, you think you're hitting the snooze and instead hit cancel.. or maybe you hit a small amount inch further left and turned on the annoying radio. This would otherwise be a good alarm if it was actually loud enough and not riddled with buttons in bad places that make it confusing when you are only half awake. Although this alarm is easy to setup, it really has a couple major flaws. First, the loudest possible setting isn't very loud at all. Quieter than every alarm I've ever owned and probably not even as loud as the ding on my microwave. This is not a great alarm clock. It takes five minutes before it annoys you to consciousness. Second, it's riddled with buttons on the top surrounding the snooze. Ironically, the closest button to the snooze is the cancel alarm button."
3,Deliberately Decieved,"I like this radio, it is compact, tolerant and pretty easy to use most of the time. The radio station is very difficult to set, especially if you live in an area that has lots of radio stations and good reception because of the small knob but once it is set then you can ignore it.My bugbear is the auto set promise. It is an outright deception. Basically I was expecting a clock that sets itself from the radio time thing that watches use. Instead I found that the 'auto set' feature is just, they set the time, sort of, in the factory and the battery keeps time until you plug it in. That is not auto-set and it left me feeling cheated."
5,Perfect!,"This alarm clock is awesome. I have one complaint, the actual plug prongs seem to be the tiniest bit off. I could not plug it into one of my surge protectors, but could plug it into another. Probably just quality control and I got an off one. Other than that it's so great! I plugged it in and bam, there's my time! You can change the time (if you like to put it fast, like I do). The radio quality is good, gets better reception than my ipod/radio boombox thing! I like the size of it, not huge like our last cd-player alarm clock. It's a SONY and it's $[...]. Better than getting some piece of junk for over $[...] from Walmart! I searched alarm clock and did bestselling. I saw this had so many good reviews, great price and fast shipping with Prime. I received this on ONE day! Perfect! ALSO I love that you can adjust the brightness! (Perfect for my fiance)"
1,Loved it except for ONE thing...,"Loved everything about this clock--it was easy to use, good snooze features, auto DST, etc. The only problem is that it ran about 8 minutes fast over 6 months, and the one thing we wanted out of this clock was accuracy. I'm getting rid of it."
2,"Looks cool, but fails as a clock","I bought this because it includes a battery backup and it is supposed to be accurately set to the minute (you simply pick the time zone). It also has 2 alarms, which is a nice bonus.But it FAILS as a clock. When I got it, it was 1 minute fast, which I can accept. Then 2 minutes fast, and now, 4 minutes fast. I need to re-scour the users guide to see if/how I can change the minutes setting (so far I've only found hour settings via time zone). No matter how cool the idea, it's reduced greatly in value when it fails in its most basic function."
1,Time is wrong.,The time on the colck is wrong. It autosets and is about 10 minutes fast. I got this clock so we would ave oe always set to the correc time. Major fail.
2,Not supposed to be complicated,"I bought this for my husband to replace the one he has had for over 25 years. It was as all clock radios are, very simple to set, reset, turn on and off. My husband is a fanatic for correct time and when he noticed this clock was off by two minutes, he spent half a day trying to set it correctly. We are retired people and have spent many years using various alarm clocks of one type or another so we are not exactly novices. It is ridiculous how much trouble this is."
2,Difficult clock,"This clock has a radio and two alarm settings.It is extremely hard to set the alarm. I never feel secure that the alarm will go off. So we set it and then use a backup (my smart phone). The instructions are not straightforard...very difficult to understand...It is a horrible feeling to set a alarm, know you have a plane to catch the next morning and not trust your alarm clock."
3,Not worth the wait,"I ordered one of these clocks for my son. Loved it so much and the ability to pull it out of the box and have it automatically set up was great. So...I ordered two more for my husband and myself. After waiting on back order forever, clocks finally came, but with dead batteries. That's half the cost of the clocks!! So we called the manufacturer and after a long phone call that nearly wore us out, their solution was to plug it in, set it manually and hope the power never fails. Not happy about that as now the point of ordering this clock was it's long life battery and it's ability to autoset. That is my reason for knocking off down to 3 stars."
1,Feels cheap - didn't work 2nd day,"The alarm went off the first day as set but the second day, it just didn't go off. Feels cheap and the radio tuner is manual and not digital. The auto tune time was a few minutes off - pretty pointless."
3,Alright.,"The cord is way too short. Because the cord acts as the antenna also, it must be angled a certain way to properly receive radio signals. I find this very frustrating. My clock must sit in an open drawer in order for it to reach the floor from my dresser with the right cord angle.It is very easy to set. I love that it shows which alarm is set without having to push buttons. The display is easy to read and clear."
1,"This clock DOES NOT do ""Automatic Time Set""","The title of the item says ""Automatic Time Set"". This is completely false. There is a (typically dead) battery in the clock and the factory sets the time at the plant. The problem is the battery is dead when you receive the clock. And the clock does not keep accurate time over a period of weeks (looses a couple minutes every few weeks). Then of course you have to adjust it several times a year."
2,Buzzing at night,The alarm clock emits a buzzing noise at all times as if radio was on. Depending on your tolerance level the noise might be annoying.
4,Inexpensive & Easy to Use,"So easy to set & price is right. Radio works good too.2 seperate alarms, radio or beep. Time is correct out of the box - that's the only ""automatic time set"" in play here - -1 star for the ""automatic time set"" which isn't really... Battery backup built in - not a 9v, aaa or aa...looks like it will last - round, flat battery of some type like a watch battery, only larger.3 settings for display. The lowest is dim enough not to bother me and the highest is fairly bright - low is tough to see in full daylight..Good value here IMHO. Would buy again ...."
3,Okay clock,"This is a pretty okay clock. I bought it because I'm going off to college. I wanted a loud alarm clock so I could make sure I woke up for class, and I hoped this would be loud since it had two alarm settings [high and low]. However, both the settings create basically the same volume. The volume for the alarm clock is definitely not loud enough, and it is a beep NOT a buzzer as it says on the box. However, the radio does work and it is loud enough, so you can set that as your alarm clock. Another thing is that this clock promised that the time would be set when I plugged it in. It was not set and I had to set it myself. I know thats not much of a hassle, but I feel that they shouldn't advertise false information. [btw: I live on the US east coast so it wasn't that I had to set the right time zone.]So in conclusion: 3 out of 5 stars. Good clock but 2 of the claimed features were not actually present."
2,Inexpensive but has a huge design flaw,"I didn't expect all that much for $20. The radio reception / sound is not great, but the time display is good (not too bright), and the size is small and unobtrusive. There is one huge design flaw! Don't their design engineers know that when someone wakes up in the morning he will reach over and want to turn it off by feel? The buttons are tiny and all feel alike. I ended up putting layers of aluminum tape over the 'off' button so when I feel it I know what it is. It would have cost nothing more to make it a raised up button. I am looking for another clock and will toss this one when I find a replacement."
4,"Clock OK, Dead Battery on Arrival","This is a great little clock radio with all of the features that I wanted. And the price was right. However, I was not able to ""just plug it in"" so it would show the correct time (with time zone adjustments) as advertised. The CR2032 battery, which keeps the time when there is no AC power, was dead. I had to go out and buy another battery to replace it. I did and now it is working fine. A more general observation: the brand name Sony used to be synonymous with quality; now it is not. Lately, most of the Sony products I have bought have had one or more defects."
5,sont icf-c318 automatic time set clock raido with dual alarm,we love our clock. It has the dual alarms which we need cause both of us have to get up at different times for work and this way we dont have to have 2 clocks or keep resetting the alarm. It is small so it doesnt take up alot of room on the night stand.The alarm setting is so much easer to set.Its easer to turn the dial then to sit there and keep holding the button down. The lighting is easy to see. I would recomend this product to everyone.
5,Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm (Black),"Nice alarm clock radio. Small compact size. I like the large numbers that you can dim. Easy to set and program 2 different alarm time settings. Radio sounds good and I get good reception with it. Big snooze button on the front top of the unit. Nothing real special about it. But, a decent alarm clock."
4,Lightweight with plastic feet that slide,I have had this alarm >1 year. It works great and easy to use. My major complaint is that it is so lightweight with plastic feet that it slides on my nightstand and I repeatedly knock it on onto the floor in the middle of the night. Have tried to put felt on feet to keep it from moving without success. I have to keep a Post-It Note holder behind it to keep it from falling off the back of it.
4,Good alarm clock but not great at picking up stations anywhere,Works fantastic as an alarm clock and has many cool features. The only problem is that it doesn't pick up radio stations very well- doesn't matter where.
3,Good Radio OK speakers,"The Radio works just as advertised, just remember it is not a stereo and does not have great quality sound. Works great as an alarm clock"
4,"Good, but off button drives me nuts","This clock is nice. Does everything it says. However, the small off button is driving me a bit nuts. It makes it difficult to turn off the alarm. It's in the middle of the upper part behind a bigger button. Overall good, but that feature is very annoying."
3,ok alarm,"My Husband had an alarm clock for over 20 years. When it finally died, we tried to replace it. But had very little luck finding on that he liked. This is our 3rd of 4th try at replacing it. He finally thinks this one is OK. Nothing special, not near as nice as his old one, but MUCH better than the last 3 we have tried. One NEW feature that we have never had but LOVE is that this clock has automatic time set. so it sets itself when you pluyg it in or the electricity has been off. NO more blinking 12:00 or incorrect time. It works much like your cell phone (as far as the correct time.) Only down side for my husband was he liked to cushion the time by setting it 10 to 15 minutes ahead (which drove me nuts) because he would wake me in the morning and ask me what time my clock said because he knew his was wrong! I love doing this to him now!"
3,"Good, but not what I expected","It's a great clock esp with the radio feature, but not as loud as I thought it would be. I was hoping to use it as a replacement to my other 4 alarms, but no such luck. I still need to set 5-6 alarms every morning to wake up, so it isn't really enough to do the job for a really heavy sleeper."
3,"Good, but....","Dual alarms that are easy to set are not all that easy to find; the Sony fits the bill. The radio is adequate for it's purpose; the selectable brightness is a definite plus; the forward/backward time/alarm set saves time and frustration --- all on the good side of the ledger. The one drawback is the buzzer setting on the alarm; it is the most apologetic alarm I have found regardless of which of the soft/loud settings you select. If you need to be rousted out of bed in the morning, this alarm is not going to cut it."
2,Poor radio reception/low alarm volume,"The radio is difficult to accurately tune, and the reception is poor. The buzzer alarm volume is low and probably wouldn't wake up someone who was in a deep sleep. The alarm volume for the radio coincided with the volume set for the radio, so if you set the sleep function with the volume low enough to fall asleep by, it is not really loud enough to rely on for an alarm."
5,great for dual career couples,"if it's possible to love an alarm clock, this is the one to love. wife and i use it to wake up at different times - beats old clock which had me resetting alarm for her once i got up - needless to say, forgetting once was enough to drive me to search out a dual alarm clock, and Sony makes it easy with quality and easy to program features."
2,poorly designed,"Buttons and switches are too close together and opposing actions are juxtaposed, so that you end up hitting the wrong buttons."
3,buttons could be easier to use.,My wife will sometimes accidentally turn the radio sound down while turning the buttons off. It's only good at best.
3,Serviceable,"The instructions could be a bit more clear.The clock brightness has 2 settings, high and low. Low is barely visible. High isn't, its what I normally expect on a low setting.Alarm volume. Again loud isn't very loud. Previous clock's alarm was audible in the next room on loud setting. This one can't even be heard in the walk-in closet of the bedroom the clock is in.It's serviceable but I'm going to continue to look for another dual alarm clock with some better features."
5,Gift given,I gave this as a birthday gift and it was received as a very welcome one. She loves everything about it.
2,very low alarm sound,"The sound of this alarm ( the buzzer) is very low, while if you use the radio as an alarm the sound is ok."
1,BAD CLOCK,I had this clock for only six months and it has more problems. This is the worse clock radio I have ever brought . It keeps on changing time zones up to three to four hours ahead during the night . Very hard to reset . Brought a different brand .I hope the new clock last longer than this piece of junk.
4,Good Clock Radio for the price,"For $15, this is the most bang for the buck you will get. Product works as advertised. Tuning could be a little rough but with some work you will get it. The plastic controls feel a bit cheap but that is expected for the price. Overall, pleased with it and would recommend it to others."
4,easy to use,"The alarm is easy to set up and easy to use except for the alarm off button. When you wake up from the alarm going off it is very hard to find the actual off button because it is so small. You have to hit snooze first, then turn on the light and find the off button. The alarm buzzer is plenty loud for me.It came set up for eastern time zone but was 6 minutes fast. It is simple to change time zones and to adjust the time."
2,Unti does not have backup battery nor head phone jack.,"Just bought an unit locally because it has a CD & dual alarm times. The radio reception is very spotty where I live and I need two alarm time settings. In addition, my MP3 units are not IPod.However, I am looking for a different unit because THERE IS NOT BATTERY BACKUP & IT DOES NOT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK.I do like that a seperate MP3 plug in."
5,excellent,"pros: excellent alarm clock with great functionality. I like that it doesn't let you set the alarm without first turning it on, so there is no way to accidentally forget to turn it on. extremely intuitive interface, so you can use it out of the box without reading any manuals.cons: only downside: i'm not sure if it came with a backup battery (?), although one certainly can install one. radio doesn't have the best reception."
3,Only One Job.. Wake Me Up,"And it does that. It's functional and space-saving. And it's Sony, so the quality is there. I do wish it had the ability to set the alarm for certain days of the week like my old Timex. Although that's not something one needs to take advantage of often, unless you work retail or something. Hated those odd hours. I recently started hearing some static through the speakers. The alarms were off and so was the radio. I have no clue what interfered with it, but I'll play around with some ideas and see what happens. It wakes me up, so it's doing what I need it to do."
3,"Fine, but shipping was way too slow","The alarm clock works fine, but it took two weeks to get it. It was the slowest shipping I've ever endured through Amazon. I'll be careful when ordering for now on."
3,good impact radio,it is good clock easy to adjust but the radio is not digital and hard to adjuston the other hand the voltage is 110 only and i have 220
4,Had what I needed.,With the battery back-up and dual alarms this had what I needed and the choice on the market was not as great as I'd thought. I dislike clock radios with the tinny intrusive sound so that was not a selling point and I've yet to turn that on. The choice of a quiet (wife) alarm and the louder (me) choice made it even better. It's a little large on the bedstand due to the unnecessary radio but we've adjusted. I might have opted for the Sony ICF-C492 large display version as less expensive and possibly smaller tabletop real estate requirements but it was not yet available.
5,Sony clock,"Great price, great alarm clock. Radio reception is much better than the one I had. Only downside, I wish the display was a little brighter. But then it might keep me up , so whatever. Recommended."
5,Nice Bedside Alarm Clock,Inexpensive with good sound from the radio. Big LED display. Easy to use. I'm Happy
3,It is just a clock radio,"I have been using this for weeks now. I left it a minute or two off to see if it would ever correct the time. It has not.It has a little flat battery inside. There is a warning light on front to tell you if the little flat battery needs replacing. I replaced the battery with a new one and the light is still on.When you cut the power the display goes dead and when you turn it on again it remembers the date time etc. That is because of the little flat battery, not any wireless atomic clock connectivity.This is an inexpensive clock radio. Nothing wrong that."
5,Love it,"This is the best alarm clock I've ever had for several reasons. First, I like my room dark when I sleep, so the dimmest setting works great for keeping my room nice and dark. Then, the alarms are very simple to turn on and adjust. I was able to set and adjust my alarm in the dark after just 2 days of using this clock, which shows just how easy the controls are to operate. Then lastly, I really like the gentle alarm beep that wakes me in the mornings. I've had alarm clocks in the past that I wanted to throw against the wall when I heard the annoying buzzer go off, but this alarm has a much more polite sound to it. I would highly recommend this to people who are looking for a nice, simple alarm clock."
4,It's a clock...,"There really isn't much to this product. It's an alarm clock with a radio. It tells time with decent sized green numbers. I haven't use it for an alarm, but there's two separate ones that you can set. Either alarm or radio can be used."
2,alarm clock,overall it is waht you expect from a sony product. But unless you are a light sleeper you will not hear alarm. Even on high setting alrm is not at all loud.
3,Cheap clock that did its purpose,"I used this alarm clock for roughly 2 years, and it has worked great for the first year or so. The past year, the switch to turn the alarm setting on has been acting up, but I was able to adjust to it with a little touch.This week has been a different story. I've woken up late 3 times due to the alarm not going off even though the time was set properly and the switch was on along with the light which indicates it!This is going in the trash this weekend and will be replaced. I guess 2.5 years of service isn't bad for something this cheap."
4,Perfect (for me) - not very loud,"I have this alarm clock across the room because I am a heavy sleeper & I am forced to get out of bed. I love the dual feature because even if I was to accidently turn off instead of push sleep mode, I have a back up. It is not a very loud or obnoxious ring, which is okay because I don't like being startled awake either. If you are a deep sleeper though you may want to look into getting a louder one. Works for me though."
3,its good........,"It's a great clock esp with the radio feature, but not as loud as I thought it would be. I was hoping to use it as a replacement to my other 4 alarms, but no such luck. I still need to set 5-6 alarms every morning to wake up, so it isn't really enough to do the job for a really heavy sleeper."
4,Clock Radio,"This clock is easy to set the alarm and easy to read. A nice size, fits easily on any nightstand. Make sure you read the instruction first on setting the time zone before you plug it in."
4,pretty good,"overall very happy, with all the power outages it was great having a self setting clock. Only comlaint is it's too easy to hit a wrong button turning it off in the dark and setting off loud static that is difficult to turn off in the dark."
2,One out of two,I had purchased two of these they got good reviews and of course they are Sony. They came quick as promised i took the first out and for the most part looked great all the functions worked well and peformed great . Plugged it in booted up and presto set.A few months later took out the second plugged it in and expected the same for this unit NOPE it was doing all kind of things spoke with a Sony rep and the try this try that still nothing ...it was past and return window so im stuck with it one would think a company as big as sony could just send out another nah. that was the reason for the 2 stars i explained i purchased 2 still got no response from sony
2,"Out of the box, the back up battery does not work","The back up battery does not work, neither the one that came with the clock nor a new one. Also, setting/resetting the time is every time the power flicks is counter intuitive - you need the instructions."
3,Doesn't tell the correct time,"I really like all of the features of this alarm clock, the alarm itself isn't too obnoxious, although the earlier it goes off the more obnoxious it sounds :-) I like having 2 alarms to set, one gets set for the every day wake up time, I can set the other as needed. I really like the adjustable brightness setting, and keep it at the lowest level. The strangest thing though is that this alarm clock is exactly 10 minutes off, and this is very strange because the clock sets itself. I understand that there's a way to manually adjust that, described in the manual, but that manual is long gone. I'll have to go online to try to find it and see if I can figure it out. Until then - I just have to remember that it's 10 minutes fast. Otherwise - a it's great clock and I'd buy another."
4,One of the best clock radios I've ever owned,"It's hard to find good clock radios, in my opinion, and this is one of the better ones. It has two alarms that can be set independently to wake you up with either the radio or a ""buzzer"". The buzzer is really more of a beeping noise, and I've found that it wakes me up without totally jolting me awake. The numbers are really big, so I can also see it across my room. The is a button for Daylight Savings Time (useful so you don't have to set the clock every time it changes) and you can even set the time zone you are in, if you happen to know the number.The only issue I've had with it is that the radio gives me a lot of static when I'm at school (in the city). When I go home to the suburbs, it works perfectly fine for me, so I'm fairly sure it isn't the clocks fault. Maybe there is too much interference.The speaker is decent, although definitely not the best that I've heard. For the price though, I think it is a very good clock radio."
2,Does not keep accurate time,"I have had this radio clock for 3.5 years. I have had problems with it for 2 years. It runs 5 to 10 minutes slow plus it does not recognize the change to day light savings time. None of this would matter if I could reset the time, but it does not allow me to reset. So now I have changed it to an incorrect time zone to at least get the correct hour. But.........it is still slow by 7 minutes. What a wonderful product. I looked at amazon to order a new clock and I see this is the most popular clock with a good rating. So.........do I order another one(after all, the price is low) or try something else more expensive, less popular, and lower rating. Nice choice. I think I will try another one...hoping that mine was an abberation."
2,blech no dreams of this clock,"the light is too bright and it keeps the wrong time for some reason even though it is radio controlled. Because it is radio controlled it is brutal to fix the time when it is wrong.It has the time run faster by roughly 5 or 10 minutes then all the other radio controlled clocks, timer server regulated computers, and cell phones I have checked. Also the radio slowly goes out of tune and the volume is jumpy from blaring to mute in the smallest fraction of a movement.we have had two other models of sony alarm clocks all had been bad in some way... I dislike this model line and sony's idea of a good alarm clock."
3,bright light and lots of buttons,The numbers on the clock are large and a pretty bright green. There's a pretty strong green glow from the clock at night. I have to tilt it to the side instead of having it face the bed where I can see the numbers since I keep the clock right next to me on my nightstand. It also took a while to get used to finding the off button in the dark because there are so many buttons on top.
4,An excellent alarm/radio,"I'm very happy with this radio. Easy to use controls, a very visible digital display and small footprint. The speaker is a bit tinny but this is understandable given the size of the radio. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. It's also a good value."
5,Brightness control works great,"Just got mine. I'd been worried about the brightness control (whether the low setting would be dim enough) based on some other reviews I'd read, but in fact it's perfect."
1,"Doesn't really display correct time, ever!","From the day we received the clock radio, it has not kept the correct time. Unfortunately, the function to reset time has never worked, either! So, we have a clock that started out 10 minutes off, and is now about 20 minutes off.The radio on it is also lousy - gets very poor reception.I've kept it because it's sort of a curiosity - I cannot fathom how an electric clock loses time?! But, I'm logging on to buy a different clock. Despite it's obvious popularity, this one gets a big thumbs down from me."
1,Runs fast,"We have had 2 of these clocks for about 4 years, in two different rooms. They consistently run fast. I can't seem to keep them (a) synchronized with each other, or (b) synchronized with my iPhone, which I know is correct. Everything else works fine, but it's annoying to have to double-check the time in two different rooms."
4,"Simple, Functional","Pros- Highly functional- Great value- Automatically adjusts for daylight savings time and keeps the time when power is out. (has battery in it)- Radio gets good reception and volume. Important to note however that the frequency adjustment is manual (in case you couldn't tell from the picture)- Simple and intuitive- Seems very well made - no flimsy buttons or knobs- Long power cord- Not too brightCons- Numbers are a little small - I wear corrective lenses and I can't read it from the foot of my bed without my glasses on.- Unable to adjust the snooze-button time. Comes automatically set to 10, then 20, then 30 minutes, and so on for each consecutive hit. If you like to snooze, this is not the alarm clock for you.- Battery is a type I have not seen before. Not sure how difficult or expensive it will be to replace when (or if) it goes out."
1,alarm is quiet and too many buttons next to the snooze,"Although this alarm is easy to setup, it really has a couple major flaws. First, the loudest possible setting isn't very loud at all. Quieter than every alarm I've ever owned and probably not even as loud as the ding on my microwave. It takes five minutes before it annoys you to consciousness. Second, it's riddled with buttons on the top surrounding the snooze. Ironically, the closest button to the snooze is the cancel alarm button. So in a hazy state from not adequately being pulled out of sleep, you think you're hitting the snooze and instead hit cancel.. or maybe you hit a 1/4 inch further left and turned on the stupid radio. This would otherwise be a great alarm if it was actually loud enough and not riddled with buttons in bad places."
4,seems fine,"So far so good. The satellite time works. The controls are ok. There is almost no innovation here and there really should be. Alarm clock controls seem designed by electrical engineers to simplify circuit board layout rather than by anyone with human factors training. The design is straight up 1980s, but you can tell that from the photo. This is probably the best alarm clock you can find, but that's not saying much."
4,Sony clock Radio,"The product works well I like the dual function alarm, big bright numbers which can be dimmed if needed, daylight savings time change worked well automatically. Alarm beeps are not the loudest but work OK for me. I have no complaints about this clock radio. Nice compact size."
5,Excellent product.,"This alarm clock has plenty of features and they all work well. The radio reception is excellent, the controls are easy to use, the display is large and clear. The date and DST settings are nice. Minor complaint: the alarm isn't exactly a ""WAKE THE HELL UP"" sound, it's a less strident and attention grabbing intermittent ""beepbeepbeepbeep"", about the same as a kitchen timer. If you're a heavy sleeper that could be a problem. But you could just switch to the radio as the ""wake-up call"" instead, and the radio is PLENTY loud when you fiddle with the volume."
5,Love it!!,"I purchased the Sony Dual Alarm clock radio, received it in 3 days. I love it. The dual alarm feature is great no complaints. The last clock radio I brought I actually lost it when I moved and I have been using my cell phone alarm for the past 2 years what a bummer, now that I have my new clock radio I am super happy, I have no idea why it has taken me so long to purchase one."
5,Great Dual Alarm Clock Radio,"I purchased two of these clocks, one for me and one for my son. I know clock radio's are not meant to have the greatest sound but I was impressed with the way it picks up many of my favorite stations with no static at all. It can't be strictly my location because this clock picks up better than any I have ever had.....and this is my first Sony. I love the convenience of the dual alarm and honestly don't think I can ever go back to a single alarm again. I didn't have to read the instructions to operate this clock and the time was right on both clocks when I plugged them in. I gave it five stars because I'm so pleased with the clock but if I could change one thing about it, I would make the beep alarm a little louder. I have absolutely no regrets with my purchase!"
3,Auto-set time is wrong,"There are things I enjoy about this clock radio - the dimmable display is great, and I like the small footprint.Unfortunately, the auto-set time is wrong. It's fast by 7 minutes. It's possible to adjust this manually and that's included in the instructions. I'm hoping I don't have to remember to adjust it every time the power goes out."
3,so-so,The Sony Clock Radio is okay. The Sony Clock Radio runs 2 minutes fast than the actual time. I have tried and tried to re-set it and with no luck. I have read the manual that came with the clock and still no luck. I am going to keep it I really like the style .
4,Almost perfect for me,"This clock was a good replacement for my 22 year old GE clock that has gotten a bit buggy. This Sony clock is almost perfect but why did they place the radio ON and Alarm reset/OFF so close to the snooze button. I have a heck of a time waking up and I hit the snooze button for about an hour, and on a few occasions accidentally hit the alarm reset button. This should be placed on the side someplace. Otherwise I like it."
3,Alarm clock,The display is great! I wish it were a little heavier so it wouldn't slide while you're trying to set it. Really like the dual alarm feature.
2,cheap clock poor alarm,works and arrived in a timely manner but alarm volume is a joke and the radio sound is poor in quality at best.its hard to believe this is a sony.the alarm volume is low no matter what the setting and very hard to tune stations due to poor tuner controls.if your looking for a good alarm clock keep looking
2,Alarm not loud enough,"Bought this for my 22 year old son. He has good hearing, and slept right through this alarm. Returning item."
1,only good at night,"This clock radio has only one problem,the time display cannot be seen during the daytime. It is viewable when the light is dim but not during the day. Sorry I purchased it."
4,"So far, so good","All functions are working so far. I'll see what the end of Daylight Savings reveals on Sunday morning. It is supposed to automatically reset. I have another one of these radios purchased in 2008. After two years in storage during a recent move, everything worked except the time and alarm time functions, so it resides in the kitchen as ""radio only."""
2,"Started acting weird after nearly 3 years, going to replace it.","Amazon says I purchased this on October 28, 2009. Worked good since then.This morning, 7/20/2012, it went off at 7 AM and I peeked at it. I closed my eyes and continued to listen to the radio while I woke up. Then it just stopped!! It's never done that before! It would stay on for hours, usually! I peeked at it again... 7:08 AM. Okay, so I have to try to get myself up. I started wiggling my toes so I wouldn't go back to sleep. I peeked at it again: 8 AM. Now, I *KNOW* I did not drift back to sleep, because I would have stopped wiggling my toes and I never broke the motion. I checked the time with my computers and the clock was way off.The bottom line is that when this ticker starts to malfunction, you're going to miss appointments."
2,"very large, not very loud","I like the turn-dial for setting the alarm, and the dimming feature. I do not like the fact that the clock is quite large with an alarm so quiet that I am forced to set my cell phone for fear it will not wake me up. Will be returning this shortly."
4,Easy to use alarm clock,I got this alarm clock to replace one that was too bright at night. This is great. No frills and is a bit hard to see in very bright light during the day. But easy to see at night and you can dim it so that it doesn't interfere with sleep. Very happy with the purchase.
5,Works great...super easy to set.,"Let's talk bout setting the alarm. There are two alarms...one you set on the left, one you set on the right. To set the time you want, you turn the knob. One direction counts ""clockwise,"" the other direction ""counter clockwise."" You hold that knob until it reaches the time you want. Go too far? That's ok, just turn it back a little. No more pressing a button over and over until you reach your desired time, and if you go to far, you have to go all the way back around again.To turn the alarm on, there is another knob on each side. You turn the knob on, it flashes that alarm time, and then goes back to clock, leaving a small light on the side of the time saying the alarm is on.The snooze button is long, on the top, and easy to hit.Has worked great for a couple months as my cell phone back up. Would absolutely recommend."
4,What alarm!!,"Once I figured out how to set the time on the alarm clock it was great. But I am not savvy when it comes to figuring out things. I missed two meeting because I thought the alarm was set. But let me blame it on me and not the product.This alarm can set duo settings which is great and has several other features on it. So if two people need to get up at different times, you can actually use one alarm clock."
3,Sony Clock Radio,The clock was the size I wanted but did not realize that the numbers would not be brighter than they are. The numbers are very difficult to read in the dark.
1,Killed by Static,"I touched the clock and was shocked by static electricity, which was enough to kill it. It lasted a total of 9 months. The cost of shipping on the return is not worth it."
2,Very Disappointed When It Changed to DST On the Wrong Day,"I bought two of these clock radios because I was impressed that they would change to DST without me having to remember to do it. However, both clocks changed to DST on the wrong day! They both changed on March 12, 2011 and not March 13, 2001."
4,Good alarm clock for a very early riser,This alarm clock was easy to set up. Its control of the volume of the alarm is very helpful for an early riser in a house full of people. Automatic time set is a great bonus!
3,Alarm not loud enough,"The alarm has a high/low switch, but I can not tell the differance. I can sleep through the little chirp sound it makes. Use the radio for loudness. I like that is has multiple dimmer settings."
1,Too bad product,"the product was too bad, it's not the same description on the website,, it works with 120V AC which not clarified in the website,,, I'm really very angry with them...VBR.."
1,A huge disappointment,"I expected MUCH more from Sony... especially sound quality. I bought a clock radio 40 years ago that puts this thing to shame. The good news... it works. The bad news... the controls are misplaced and poorly marked. There is no digital tuning. There are no presets. It sounds AWFUL ! It ""features"" dual alarms, which I don't need. This thing was designed by a jokester."
1,don't get this,not user friendly. could not even set the time. my daughter in graduate school couldn't either.
4,Enjoyable Reading Ahead,"Scene of Crime struck me as the author's roll of the dice. It begins with the chaos of the vigorous toss. I was then engaged by the skillful organization of a variety of everyday encounters and events and ...of course...the events surrounding... the murder; I appreciated being clued into the ""time line"" of this mystery novel.I had never heard of Ms. McGown's two lead detectives, Hill and Lloyd, prior to learning of her own recent death. As someone new to this famous detecting duo, I enjoyed their unraveling of the mystery while they remained ""interesting"" and believable.I found the many characters to be diverse, colorful and very ""human"". They all remained consistent without becoming overly predictable.The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was the missing grappling with the ""shadow"" or the deeper aspects of the character(s). Unfortunately this omission resulted in a somewhat shallow albeit thoroughly enjoyable read. I'd definitely read more of this author."
3,The album track is lovely. The other 2 feel like filler,"I was so struck at the accessibility, the more tender tone, the lowered presence of whacky instrumentation due to Teenage Fanclub being a buncha nice guys, musically. So, I wanted to try the 2 non lp tracks and they're certainly not as tender and well played and firm musically played as Near To You which as fine a Jad Fair track as he's ever done, downright ready for radio, virtually almost. But the other two are a bit repetitive, the last song a bit electronic but neither worth a second listen, least to these ears, in fact, I can see why they didn't include them on the original album, they feel a step below in constructed quality. My six dollars total got me that answer. Maybe my review will help guide you about making a similar investment or not? God bless."
1,"Interesting topic, wooden characters.","The topic of refugees is timely and pressing. However, the characters in Refugee Boy are, at best, two-dimensional; it is impossible to empathise with them, because they do not feel real.For a book that offers engaging characters, as well as being informative, turn to Beverly Naidoo's The Other Side of Truth. The vitality and depth of the characters makes their situation much more urgent and accessible."
4,Refugee boy,"A book written for children or teenagers, yet adults will find it amusing as well. We read it with our reading group and everyone liked it despite a rather simple language. Easy read for lower levels."
5,just what i needed,"This works great when you r feeling sluggish and tired, use this and it will help cleanse the body, leaving you feeling more energized and happy."
4,ROBOSAPIEN MUST HAVE GUIDE,"This is a good book to have for ur robot, has a lot of neat ideas and ways to modify your robosapien and make it that much more fun to play with"
5,A window into the legacy of an unappreciated composer,"What makes this DVD different from many others about composers is the large amount of video footage available showing Carl Orff, the times, and performances of his work. Before watching this DVD I knew little about Carl Orff or his music beyond Carmina Burana. After watching this DVD, I feel that his music deserves to be better known and bought a number of CDs of his non Carmina Burana music. At a deeper level this DVD deals with the issues of accommodation -- how does one survive and pursue their passion (composing) when the world one knows is dissolving around them. Though Tony Palmer does not do this with a hammer, the themes of accommodation, survival and guilt are recurrent. The film is beautifully done. The interposition of interview, background images and performance provide a strong forward motion that maintains interest. I watched this DVD twice. I watched it once and then immediately watched it again, I found it that interesting."
2,Orff is a minor composer,"Why did Tony Palmer bother with Carl Orff? Orff has only one real great work, Carmina Burana and the rest of his work is not that good. He is known from his educational work which is noted here but there were other, greater composers like Hindemith that made important contributions to education and music. Palmer seems to be interested in whether or not Orff was sympathetic to the Third Reich which remains a question. What you find out here was that Orff did nothing during the Second World War to help anybody and after the war he lied about being part of the opposition. Orff was a coward, an opportunist and is very unimportant as a composer. If it were not for Carmina Burina we would have never heard of him."
3,Bought just for the video,"I got this single just to get the video. It's a really cool video featuring Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt from Mighty Boosh and Nick Frost from Spaced, Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. It isn't DVD quality, it's a Quicktime MOV, but it's pretty good and better than you'd find on the net. The single's ok, and the song is great, but I'd really only recommend this if you want the video or are a collector."
4,Ilustrated buyers guide Ford pickup trucks,"The book does a good job telling you about the Ford pickup trucks, but all of the pictures are in black and white. It has a star rating for collectability for each model. Still a nice book to have if you are a Ford truck fan."
1,Doesn't work on Cassiopeia E-125.,"Looks like it doesn't work on CE 3.0. That is in keeping with the system requirements listed here, but not with those listed on Cassio's site."
3,"Dueto Amanecer ""Serie de Colecion""",This was a gift for my father and he really enjoyed. He was very happy with the product. I personally thought it was a little pricey.
5,Great gift idea!,This is for my outdoorsy son! I hope he will use it to record his travels and thoughts as he goes into the wilds around our area.
3,Not Thrilled for Common Use.,"Was hoping for more in terms of weight and feel. The product feels cheap and writes with the aesthetic of a cheap ballpoint pen. If your job requires that you write in wet environments, and you pair this with the Rite-In-The-Rain notebooks and paper, you might have a different experience. For use in normal environments though you could do a lot better. You might even notice that gel-based inks (like the Pilot G2, etc.) are already waterproof.In cases which require a person to write in extreme environments, I defer to the reviews of those who have had to do as much.For normal environments and applications you're sacrificing a pleasant aesthetic and feel for the sake of ... preparedness? bragging rights?Not for me. Returned."
2,It writes but not for long,I loved this pen it always wrote. I fidget a lot so I took this pen apart and put it back together again many times. One time I over tightened it and it striped the plastic inside. It was sorta okay but when tightening the top back on it would slip and became loose. So I got annoyed because the pen broke and I just kept tightening and tightening making it slip. It was so loose that it could no longer write anymore the top just popped off. I'm going to try to glue the ink cartage so I can use it in a different pen barrel. I already threw the barrel out. I'm going to try a fisher pen and hope to have a better experience.
4,"Reliable pen, if a little expensive.","I camp in an area with a lot of sand in the soil. Normally, I'd go through a pen a day journaling because the sand binds up their mechanism. I've had to get this pen started once or twice, but it has been going strong for a couple weeks now with no signs of real problems."
3,A decent pen,The pen does write on anything and in the rain as advertised. The only problem is the pen always comes apart in my pocket and it's very easy to lose the parts. If the pen didn't come apart so easy I would rate it 5 stars. It's an expensive pen and I have a lot of spare pen parts now from losing pieces.
4,Quite good!,"Good pen. It's got a good weight and feel. The end unscrews a little too easily, but I haven't lost anything yet. It's not gel-pen smooth, but it really works well withRite In The Rain - All-Weather Pocket Journal (4"" x 6"")."
5,Good for emergencies and general use.,"I got one of these as a free gift from Rite In The Rain when I was still in the Navy. Back then they were considerably more expensive. Thanks to Amazon for making them a much better deal. These use the same inserts as the Fisher Space pen, but the body is much stronger. They could be used a hole puncher if needed. Everybody should keep at least one of these in their car for emergencies, along with a Rite In The Rain notepad. They are comfortable enough for day to day use, and sturdy enough for camping trips or cub scout jamborees. Any time you need a pen which holds up to more vigourous uses, get one of these."
3,It writes!,"I bought this pen a little bit ago to use at work. It will write on any paper on darn near any surface. I have only two issues with the pen. The first is that the ink is really light. Hard to read sometimes. The second is that the top of the pen comes detached from the pen leaving a white plastic cap. It is nearly impossible to get it back on and if you do, the pen will never click the same again."
3,Dissapointing work from a usually consistent author,"Pinski's past books, especially those on the open games are to be recommended. However, this thin volume is rather poorly researched, offers little original analysis, and omits many critical lines. I have had to look to many other sources to flesh out theoretical coverage of these lines, which is something I certainly didn't have to do with Pinski's 2 knights or Benko books. I hope this is an isolated incident of a good author getting distracted by a deadline or other obligations, and that Pinski's work going forward will display the same depth of research and analysis that most of his other books do."
3,This Video needs more Music Videos,"This film is a good DVD all the videos are in full-length form and the director kept the minue nice and simple making it elidgible for any idiot. However the producer of this film forgot some of petty's hit videos like ""Letting you go"", ""American Girl"", ""Walls"", ""It's Good To Be King"" and many more.This DVD gets 3 stars, because I like the format and all of the videos are in full-length form, but if I were to produce this DVD since it came out in the year 2001, I would feature a video the the hit Petty song ""The Last DJ"" Along with every single one of his other hit music videos.By: Ted Kissel"
3,"I like this a lot, but...","This is a really great video, with really great songs, but when you watch a whole lot of Tom Petty, and look past that twinkle in his eye and the humor, and the macho rock n roll, you find that he's lacking a certain warmth. He's good at being mad. He's good at being sardonic. But. It's hard to connect to the cockles of his heart. He's a bit cool and a bit remote and he doesn't let you into his ribs, and into his brain and bones, all the way. Not like Lennon and McCartney (in their prime), or Morrisson, did. Petty is clever, amusing, fun, interesting and he's got a lot of tricks. But. There's not a lot of poetry in what he does and he's a bit of a sphinx. Is he a sphinx without a secret though?"
4,Great Videos! But...,"...I hope they re-release these videos at some point and re-master them while they're at it. Even though this is a DVD, the videos are grainy and not that much better quality than the VHS version. And as others have mentioned, the sound is only plain stereo. They could tack on some of the videos Tom Petty has done since 1995, too, like You Don't Know How It Feels and It's Good To Be King.That being said, this is an amazing collection featuring some of the best music videos ever made. If you have ever watched MTV in the era before 1996, you've seen at least a few of them. They're classics and it's great having them on DVD!"
4,Sound quality not that good,"Great DVD with the great Tom Petty videos that I remember from my MTV-video-watching days.A great collection of his best hits. Might have left out a few that came after, but I cannot recall them.My only complaint is the sound quality.It should be ""re-mastered"" or whatever for better sound quality. If they do that I would definitely buy another copy as long as the sound was much improved. I want the music to sound the same way it does on the CDs.My favorite videos from this collection are ""Free Fallin'"" and ""Learning to Fly"".In Learning to Fly, I remember MTV would air this and the censors would completely miss the topless girl in body paint dancing and writhing on the video. I used to get a chuckle from that.And in Free Fallin', the video is prophetic with its visual of all the American cars on a California highway turning into Japanese imports."
5,Classic,"I agree with the majority of people. These are all classics. They arewithout a doubt some of the greatest music videos ever made. Inever forgot back in the 80's when I saw the one for ""Don't Comearound Here No More"" and in the 90's when I saw the one for ""MaryJane's Last Dance"". The first was one of the greatest takes on Alicein Wonderland that I have ever seen and the second was unforgetablebecause it had Kim Basinger in it. All these videos were madewonderfully and have stood the test of time. This DVD is a must havefor any fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. All these arerememebered now and will be remembered 30 years from now. That iswhat sets it apart from the crap that MTV puts out today. All theartist of today will be forgotten 20 years from now. A DefinitiveClassic. As Far as I'm concerned, he helped create the music video."
3,an okay dvd,"shouts ""thrown together by the record execs. for some quick cash!"" black and white background, no extra features, just videos and a menu screen saying ""play movie"" and ""scene selection"". the videos themselves are pretty good, some interesting ones later into their career. but really needs a few bonus features like a few live videos or some interviews. wouldn't quite reccomend it."
3,Not Carl's best effort!,"We fell in love with Carl after reading ""Good Dog, Carl!"" We were amazed when we picked up ""Carl's Afternoon in the Park."" We were disappointed with this book, however. The story does not flow very easily (why do they spend so much time waiting by the elevators ... is this supposed to be a reality book???). This makes it difficult for a parent to maintain the child's interest in the book. The artwork isn't as detailed as the aforementioned books. Our two-year-old girls quickly dump this book for another. I would suggest previewing any Carl books before buying, to make sure they meet your expectations."
1,Strange books,"My daughter likes the pictures, but the storyline is wierd. I just don't like a story about a mother that leaves her infant alone in public in the care of her dog. I also don't like images of a baby riding on the dog's back (and even standing on, in one of the other books), I certainly wouldn't want my child to think she could try that with our Rottie. I know it is a kid's book, and supposed to be cute, but I just don't like the Carl books, and I don't think they send a good message about proper child care at all."
5,Great book about abusive mother,"This is a really funny and endearing book about an abusive/neglectant mother who routinely abandons her baby in different places. Thankfully the dog,Carl, is actually a genius who cares for the baby during her frequent abscences. Due to necessity he has learned how to feed, bathe, and entertain the baby. In this adventure, Carl shoplifts in order to survive the city streets and feed the infant.The infant does come from a two parent household. In another book of the series, both mother and father leave the baby home alone with Carl so they can go out and party. I think that one is called ""Carl goes to the Masquerade"".In all seriousness, this is a great book series and I would recommend it for any child. The parents will get a kick out of them too. I know I did."
5,A great book for all ages. Need a laugh; this will do it.,"After ""reading"" this book I felt as though I could entrust Carl to babysit anytime."
4,Excellent history and origins of dance and womens rituals,"Delightful book discussing the history of the dance. Discusses why women performed this dance and the correlation to the earth and Goddesses. Gives a sense of empowerment to women and how men came to take a more dominant role over women's actions, beliefs and body. Great confidence booster for self image and womanhood."
5,Insightful look into another world,"This to me is not a book to read if you want to learn how to belly dance. It is fond recollection of the author's childhood and how dance is passed down through the generations from one woman to another and not ""taught"" in the text book sense. I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend it to beginning belly dancers as a spiritual or philisophical look at the impact dance can have on your life. A very interesting read!"
5,Beautiful Memoir,"You won't find any direct instruction about how to belly dance here, but it's a lovely book that details the author's childhood and beliefs about the philosophical and spirtual aspects of belly dance. This book would make a nice gift for a beginning belly dancer or someone who's interested in knowing more about the dance."
2,I was disappointed,"The first section, when she is talking about growing up learning from her Grandmother is very nice, and quite enjoyable. After that though, it goes quite down hill. I started reading the 'history' part (which was the main reason I bought the book) and...well after a while I really just couldn't take it anymore. I'm no dance historian, but it seems to be primarily conjecture, and her own opinion, with very little (if any) research of her own done. Bleech. I skimmed the rest, but as I really don't dance yet (I'm more a musician) and I don't think I could learn just from a book anyway."
5,First Bellydancing Book I'm Reading,"When I started learning bellydance in my home on video, I searched the web for more Information. I found this book. I liked it so much by just being able to read some of the book(A Big THANKS for that!!). Maybe some things are made up but it is to me, a story & a learning tool for belldancing. The author makes me feel like I'm right there with her. She is very discriptive and I can visualize every thing. The price was right,it came packaged in good condition and did'nt take a long time to receive it. Thanks!Dee-Dee from Birmingham, AL"
2,Wierd.,"This should have been three books, maybe then it wouldn't have been so jaunting.The beginning section was very nice, with descriptions of the womans' childhood. Then we are thrown into dime-store, fresh from college "" feminist ranting"". I read it just to see what she had to say. Most of what she said has been said many times and a lot more simply by a lot of other people.The section on bellydancing itself was probably the best part of the book. She gives a spiritual meaning to the moves, which I enjoyed very much. But after the rollercoaster ride that was the previous part of the book, I kept trying to put the whole thing into some sort of context, and was unable to.As a bellydancer of 12 years I had high hopes for this book,but what I found was that it read like an elementary school paper. "" My grandma was nice. Girls rule. Dancing is good to do. The end."""
5,A joyous and transformative experience,"For me it was, anyway. This writer provides a glimpse into a culture I can never fully relate to, but more important than that she shows me the things I CAN relate to and cherish about women everywhere. A beautiful book, one I will insist my belly dance students read!!!!"
2,Not the real thing,"Before buying this as a Christmas gift for my wife, I read several negative reader's comments. We're both big Lewis Black fans though, so I thought aw, heck - how bad can it be. Well, pretty bad from where I stand. The issue is that it's mostly not Lewis Black. It's a whole bunch of other people - some famous, some less so - talking about a variety of holiday events. It's only narrated by Lewis Black, who gets in just a few lines of his own on the whole DVD.My wife said she still enjoyed it, but for me, it wasn't what I thought I was buying."
2,Not what I expected,Combination of stories by other comics about Christmas. Not one of his best. Must be an early work. He is so much better noe
2,Not up to Mr. Black's prior DVDs,"Weak not sure if there was even a laugh in the whole DVD, write me and you can have mine for free"
2,Surviving the Holidays with Lewis Black,"I was very unhappy with this dvd. I was expecting alot more from Black and his pals. There were a few funny parts, but very few. I think it was a waste of plastic to make this product."
1,Waste of money,"I thought this dvd would be of Lewis Black doing his normal stand up routines onstage. But all it is, is other comedians putting their 2 cents in about the holidays. It was really a bore to watch."
3,Mellow Pharoah,"As a fan of jazz in its mellower forms I really dig ""Priceless Jazz by Pharoah Sanders"". Along with albums such as Miles Davis's ""Kind of Blue"", John Coltrane's ""A Love Supreme"", Charles Mingus's ""Mingus Ah Um"" and Dave Brubeck's ""Time Out"", this sampler CD is essential listening. Most of the songs on ""Priceless"" are spacey and meditative. I'm not so thrilled by the blues-inflected and busy ""Bluesin' For John C."" (though I know 'where he's coming from'), the oriental flavored ""Japan"" or the free-form ""The Promise"" so I've subtracted a couple of stars. The rest of the tracks are gems with ""The Creator Has A Master Plan"" being the high point for me. If albums like ""[...] Brew"" by Miles are a bit much, a bit too 'difficult listening' (to borrow a phrase from avant garde popster Laurie Anderson), then this CD is for you."
5,Wonderful!,"Out of the Blue is a wonderful book. Sally Mandel really gets into her characters. Anna Bolles becomes so real that I could not put this book down. I have ordered Ms. Mandel's other four books, but unfortunately, they are all out-of-print. I heard Sally Mandel on the Joan Hamburg show this morning and she was great."
4,Great book but not recommended,"I really enjoyed this book, but as a librarian I won't put my ""Recommended by Linda"" sticker on it because of the language. Anna Bolles' mother Norma is a mature, intelligent businesswoman. Nowhere in the book does she even appear to be eccentric, crude, or distasteful.....except in her language. With Sally Mandel's talent for characterization, I am surprised she couldn't develop the character without every conversation having the word f--- in it."
5,Music Was Best Part Of The Movie,"I collect Christmas music, now at the rate of about one CD a year, carefully previewing offering after offering on Amazon. I prefer non-traditional items at this point, although I got the complete Gene Autry CD last year. I'm still not sure I like the film Christmas With The Kranks, although I seem to enjoy it a little more each year.The point of this long-windedness is that Little Steven, who was responsible for the soundtrack selections, has put together here a sort of ""best of"" program of unusual (with the exception of Brenda Lee) but strongly listenable Christmas music. I don't think, for example, I would want a whole CD of the Raveonettes, and their MP3 Christmas EP seems uneven, but the selection here is fine.I put this high on the list of Christmas CDs."
5,book,"Every Daddy in the world must read this adorable book!! A love story from the depths of the heart...poignant, endearing, inspiring and it will touch your deepest being. Get this for the man in your life."
4,Book To Be Shared,"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any father/daughter with a ""special"" relationship.I passed it to a friend who's daughter is graduating soon and who herself is a dancer.....both of them enjoyed the book and cried with me over its beauty.Highly recommend this for sharing with a loved one."
3,"eh, it's ok",It's interesting reading and explains some behaviors but not as good as I thought it'd be.
2,Not What I Expected,"I thought this book would help me translate the different sounds my cats make. I thought it would deal more with things like what different tail movements mean. Basically, I thought the book would help me figure out what my cats are thinking. After all, the title is ""Think Like a Cat""!"
3,Good beginner's guide,"The information is helpful, easy to read, and seems intended for people who haven't lived with cats. For those who have, there aren't any new insights into the care and feed of or psychology of cats."
5,"With this book, you'll see the world through kitty's eyes!","Before this book, I was going nuts with my two kittens. I didn't understand why they would scratch my rugs, walk on table tops and eat my plants. After having read this fantastic book, I completely understand what's going on in their minds (well, almost) and our relationship has gotten so much better. Now, I cannot even live without them and my cats have brought me so much joy in my life. This book made a difference between night and day... Pam knows cats best.The book is easy to read, funny and really in tune with the cat owner in mind. She provides plenty of resources and information. Even my vet has to consult her book for understanding cat behavior! This is a must buy and every cat owner should have one on their bedside!"
5,"Thinking like my cat, well not really","Book is great if you just got a cat after many years of not having one. It does help you get into the mind of your feline buddy, making peaceful living more possible. The tips are great from litter box tips, need for play time, as to why cats scratch sooooo much. Bought this w/ another cat book, and they were shipped quickly and as a new pet owner I find myself thumbing through them frequently. BTW in NYC most pet stores don't carry books on pets; they simply weren't a hot item. So here ya go..."
5,Great Resource,"I always wished my cats could talk so I'd know what they were thinking. Now I can understand them a little better. Written in an easy to read humorous style this is good resource as well as a good read. If you're a cat lover you might also enjoy ""A Cup of Comfort for Cat Lovers."""
5,My cat and I love this book!,"I've got one angelic cat and one demonic cat. I purchased this book in an attempt to understand the ""bad"" cat. We are doing better now. She was beating up on the other cat, scaling the door and howling when not allowed out, attempting to scratch posters off the wall, ect, ect!!! Thanks to this book, my demon cat is a lot happier, and so am I! The angelic cat isn't walking on egg shells anymore either, waiting to fend off bullying. This book is a lifesaver!"
5,Well worth the price!,"I'm not crazy about this author's write-down-to-your-audience style, but when I can through the overly simple stuff and get to the answer I'm looking for, the book is a help and offers some good insight."
3,OK Advise,This book was OK on some of the advise it was right on but otehrs it was far off base to what my cats did and did not like.
3,Just another cat book,"I thought this book would tell me how to think like a cat. Instead, I found the book mostly rehash of material found in any other book on the subject with nothing about how to think like a cat.Because the book is a good compilation of existing material found in other books I gave it 3 stars."
5,An excellent book for cat owners.,"It's fun to read such a no-nonsense manual for cat owners. Clear, concise, but gentle in tone, this book covers all aspects of pet ownership, from litter box issues to poisonous plants.The book asserts that most problems cat owners face are a direct result of misunderstandings -- misunderstandings that arise because humans don't understand the cat's point of view. One must admit this theory is compelling. I've had this book a year, and consider it indispensable. It's resolved several problems I thought were impossible. And I must admit that my cats seem a lot happier now that I've been reading this lady's writing. I certainly don't have any behavioral problems with either of them anymore.Push all the other how-to manuals off the shelf. This is the only one you need."
5,Great Book!,This is a great book for anyone owning a cat. I bought one for myself and one for my nephew and his wife who have added two kitties to their life. This book has so much info. I have had kitties for 40+ years and can't believe how much I learned. I have had better success with training my flame point Siamese since getting this book. It deals with just every issue you could have with your cat. Very easy to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a cat in their life.
4,Full of helpful insights.,"Great lessons that help you understand your cat and ensure you do all you can to help your cat be happy and healthy. Wish there was more info on nutrition, however I understand how difficult it is to find reliable information on how best to feed our cats. Also recommend her book ""Cat vs Cat"" which I relied on to successfully introduce a new cat into our household. These two books are among the best I have read on cats."
5,Best cat book ever!,"This book covers it all, I would highly recommend it for any cat parent. Advice is clear and easy to follow. Very helpful if you've adopted your first cat/kitten or have had cats for years."
3,Not bad if you ask me,"Although I am more in favor of hearing Heart in their Dreamboat Annie/Little Queen early days, I think this CD is good for their later hits though I am not farmiliar with some of the songs (I don't own any 80's heart CDs besides the greatest hits) and Ann and Nancy may not have written all of it but I still hear their talent and devotion pouring out. My favorite ""How can I refuse"" which WAS written by them is probably their best of that era in my opinion.... You can't stay the same forever. Have an open mind and try this CD out. Barracuda never sounded so rockin!"
3,And rock they did.,"I take a much more positive view of this live CD recorded in Worcester, MA in 1990 than the other reviewer. I believe it was released in 1991. What it is, is a good representation of a band who had a pop rock rebirth and did it well at that. Most of the songs on this CD are from the rebirth period and they certainly are not bad. ""Shell Shock"" is good as is ""How Can I Refuse"", a great song off the ill fated Passionworks LP. There's no ""Magic Man"" but there is ""Love Alive"" from theLittle Queen LP. The CD closes with ""Barracuda"". I paid very little for this CD and its a nice rock n' roll CD to have around. One thing is for certain: Ann Wilson's voice kicks some major [butt]"
1,Not true to size,I bought this for my almost 3 year old daughter. All 6 of us are wearing 50's outfits for Halloween. It didn't fit her. It does however fit my 9 month old daughter. It is a little too short and tight for my liking but Prime didn't send me the one I ordered for my 9 month old so I am stuck. They said they were unable to send to our address but all the others somehow magically got here. Frustrated!
1,Big Time Rip-Off,I don't know why people want to do this to their fans... It's too expensive for what you're getting... a few videos. There's a D12 song for promotional purposes and a worthless little tour of Eminem's house you'll never watch twice. The best part was the making of 'Stan'. Could've included a concert performance or interviews. 'Buyer Beware'
4,next friday,i think this movie is a very good movie. It is very funny.i think everyone should watch it!
4,"""E"" Eminem","E is the new DVD of Eminem this DVD is off the hook. This DVD is not in most of the stores, so far from what I know it's only in the internet. If your a Eminem fan you should have this DVD."
4,Thw new E dvd,i got the dvd yesterdat at hastings i think it's worth what i pay for it i only pay 15 dollors for the dvd the dvd has more then the vhs has the dvd has all 7 videos he has mad and has behind the scenes of stan and a little skit at marshall's house.
2,It's Alright.....Not What I expected,"This DVD was alright.. It wasnt what i expected. I dont think it was worth the money that i spent for it. I paid...bucks and for a DVD that only has like eight music videos and only one ""the making of"" video. It kinda sucks... But if your a true Eminem fan, you might love it. It also has a marshall mathers peak, making fun of blair witch..That was funny"
2,Boring!,"I find this video tape of Eminem very boring, I thought it will had more to it, well for the price it was not much because you could had see the music video he did on mtv or vh1. It mostly that, you see music video on this tape, well if you are a fan and didn't saw some of is previous music video go buy it but if you want to know more about Eminem well that tape is not for you. I thought it was more a documentary with music video, I thought Eminem will talked about his music video, his music, his life but no you just see his old and more recent music video and that's it. I think this video tape is not worth the price I pay!"
3,Good content. Poor index.,"I had not used Visual Basic for several years before purchasing this book. I had forgotten a lot, and lots of things have changed. As I worked my way through this book, I found the actual content to be extremely useful. There is a good overview of a wide range of topics. The example programs are excellent starting points for understanding the various topics, and most proved easy for me to expand upon.As I progressed through the book, I would frequently have the desire to use syntax, functionality, examples, etc. that I was sure that I had already read about. Unfortunately, it was not very long before I realized that the index was very underdeveloped for a book containing this much information. The index is a very important part of any good reference book, and is a big weakness of this otherwise good text."
4,It's nice if u have a good background!,"The book is very nice and very reach, but it is writen in a brief language whitch is unsuitable for beginners."
5,"Insightful, readable, enjoyable--the ultimate Apes book.","From beginning to end this is the study of the Planet of the Apes series that everyone of the series' fans have dreamed of and that academics who never took the series seriously will learn from and hopefully teach.In addition to being an enjoyable read, Greene has a politically-minded scholar's insight that helps lift the series from trivia into concrete seriousness. I think it is a model for future works of film scholarship and appreciation."
1,We don't need no self-congratulation,"It is strange that so many Amazon reviews for this author's books contain the phrase ""the author, Adam Robinson."" Who would say that but the author himself? And who begins a book with the statement ""This is the greatest SAT book ever written?"" Creepy."
3,colour,it's okay for the kids pants but even those jean thread colours are changing here but it's good quality thread.
3,A couple of useful tools,This suite of tools is moderately useful. The file manager is nice but it should be built into the OS. The best applet is the task manager that runs on the Start menu that allows you to close apps much faster than going through the System applet in the Control Panel.
3,Works... kind of,"I applied this product three times to my glove over the course of two days. It is a bit more supple (more noticeable with the laces), but overall the result is disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money!!,I bought these for use in a DVD burner on my computer as well as for a DVD recorder I use to record off my TV. Roughly two thirds of the disks in the package either crashed during burning or were simply unreadable. I ended up with about 17 usable disks and a garbage can full of the rest of the contents of the package.Try another brand if you want a reliable product.
3,Nice product,Nice product which is worth it's price.Arrived in a reasonable timeframe and the DVD's are of good quality.I would definetly recommend this product for uses like back up or copying entertainment stuffs
2,Major disappointment,"After using the DVD+RW format with both Maxell and Memorex, I decided to give these a try, and maybe save a few bucks in the process. I should have spent the extra money and gotten what had already worked for me.These have been a real pain in the neck. Either they won't work at all, or they can't be read after having been recorded on, or won't allow me to record after they have been recorded on (BEFORE finalizing). I subsequently tried some Memorex and Maxell DVD+RW, just to make sure it wasn't my recorder; they gave me no problems at all.I have used some of these TDK DVD-R successfully, but 2 out of 5 good burns is not satisfactory. Maybe I just got a bad batch....but this is my first experience with TDK; it will probably be my last."
2,Poor choice for Apple Drives,"Apple Superdrives (DVD-R/CD-R/etc...) don't burn these above 2x. Even recording at 2x speed (about a half hour per DVD, if you use most of the space up) I end up throwing out about 1 out of 4 discs.2 stars instead of 1, because you get what you pay for. If you have time to wait a really long time for slow burning on these, it would be harder to find a cheaper cost per dvd-r."
3,Good for general purpose use,"TDK no longer makes their own media. According to experts, there are better quality discs out there, but these are not bad. They are RITEKF1, made in Taiwan using Fuji Dye. They don't quite meet archival standards, but are good general purpose discs. If you want a disc that is considered ""1st Class - Archival Grade"", you would be better off with Verbatim (just standard Verbatim - not value or life series), Taiyo Yuden, and a few others if you can find them. If super long life is not a concern, and it is a good sale price, I think the TDK would suit the purpose."
1,Poor quality...,"Bought TDK DVD-Rs, likely at Office Depot... So far, when burning DVDs, no record of any problem while burning, but there seems to be some corrupted part of the DVD during playback and the DVD freezes. Tried multiple DVD players. Sigh... Will no longer buy TDK DVD-Rs."
1,Very Unsatisfied,"I'm very disappointed in this battery. The reason I bought a new battery was because my old battery couldn't retain its charge for more than an hour. This battery is no different. Even after a short phone conversation(<30 minutes), the battery is exhausted and the phone goes completely cold. It's like the manufacturer re-packaged used batteries to be resold. Furthermore, the battery was packaged in a small ziplock plastic bag with its own self-made label. As for the 1-year warranty. No warranty information was included in my packaging. I bought two of these batteries, and I wasted my money."
1,complete rip-off -- beware,"not only does this battery not hold a charge for longer than 30 minutes (even when initially charged for the suggested amount of time), it cuts in and out of power causing phone calls to be dropped. mine also arrived in a zip-lock bag with no warranty information and since amazon no longer provides a customer service telephone number, I'm not inclined to battle with them for assistance over a purchase that cost under $10. that said, this is likely to be my last purchase with them as there track record has sharply declined with each order over the past 3 years."
1,Poor Quality,I bought a battery for my cordless phone about a couple of month ago. The battery is dead already. The battery I had before last 2 years. I would never buy anything from thses guys anymore.
1,Do not buy!,"I bought 2 of these for our system here - one never would charge for more than 20 min talking, and the other is now dead. I have a similar problem with my home phone (also a Panasonic) and know others who are having the same frustration. I'm now going to get a completely different phone system from a different manufacturer."
4,Final installment?,"Having read Sarah Smith's first two novels, I could hardly wait to read the third -- reportedly final installment of a trilogy. Like the second, this novel contains an involving new story as well as gripping developments in the ongoing saga of Alexander Reisden and Perdita Halley -- and my only objection is, I can't believe this is the final novel of the series! Without giving away the plot of this book, I have to say it strikes me as being set up for another sequel. And it's only fair to point out to future readers that, while this book is set in 1911, Smith earlier reported that she intended the final novel of the trilogy to be set in 1914 -- World War I. I'm still waiting for that novel! -- A Passionate Fan, Kirsten Russell"
4,"Convenient package, even if they're all online","I bought this book because it's a handy package; I use the online archives all the time, but I also print out a lot of RFCs, and I like having them all in a book with an index. The author states right up front that all the RFCs are online (even gives URLs for an archive....) so it's not like he's trying to pull a fast one or anything.If you're some uber-networking-geek, then you probably have some secret macro in emacs to help you read RFCs, but for the rest of us mortals this is a convenient alternative."
1,oh please,the bgp rfcs are available online for free via rfc-editor.org. that makes the text fully searchable. what a load of baloney.
1,Hope you enjoyed wood shop,"This box comes unassembled. And, to make matters worse, the box full of slats and posts and boards and screws arrived missing four crucial pieces -- the rails that the slats are inserted into along the top and bottom. So, don't let the picture fool you like it fooled me. On the positive side, the cedar smells nice."
2,Works good until the cord breaks,"This item works well enough for about a year or so - however, the joint where the cord connects to the power block will fray over time to the point of separation, and then you're out of luck. I have purchased 2 of these adapters and the same thing has happened each time. I would not recommend purchasing this!"
5,Immortal masterpiece,"Words cannot do justice to this record. It is over the top hard hitting slow grinding new school HC (with a fast part here and there) which was so popular around that time. But not as generic as your average ""chugga-chugga"" mosh band. These guys were musicwise far ahead of the rest and lyricwise it is very dark and gloomy (nearly poetry) full of bitterness and anger..."
4,Batman in the Cold War.,"Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were high, right up to 1989, when freedom rang throughout all of Europe and the Iron Curtain came crumbling down. The edgy suspense of the times were incorporated in comics and Batman lore, giving rise to the KGBeast. The KGBeast is the complete anthisis of Batman, instead of an armed detective who works to save lives, the Beast is an armed detective who works to take lives. He was the best assasin the KGB ever produced, but like many experiments, something went wrong and he began taking things into his own hands. Nothing seems able to prevent him from knocking off his hit list one by one and the last name on the list, is the President of the United States. Only, the Beast never expected for a Bat to fly in his way. Interesting story, somewhat dated because of the Cold War theme, yet that's also what makes it so intriguing."
4,And I Thought My Life Was Hard...,"Stephen Fine's Molly Dear is probably one of the most endearing characters in sci-fi. The journal of her life has everything one could hope for in a profoundly twisted future. Anatomically correct androids that serve and service we world weary humans, answering our every need, with a lot more resentment than we would ever give them credit for.. let's face it life as a woman real or android is always something to write about."
4,Little Known Facts of WW2,Not a bad book but it is pretty basic. Good information along with some great B&W pictures. Also contains a good selection of color pics ... very helpful for a model builder.
3,cannot handle a real game,"this racket seems as if it could offer some durability but that is far from the case...power that it can give you is good, as well as the feel of the racket is good...but the strings were already loose and need readjustment after basically 8 games of 45 min...meaning it becomes very annoying when u have to readjust the strings after every third shot...for a beginner this would be a great racket since power shots are not going to be a huge concern."
5,Updated recipes for today's cooking.,These two ladies came out with a fantastic book. If you get a chance to find a copy of this you will also appreciate their style & use of flavor & texture in the recipes. They come from California as did Alice Waters...in fact one of the ladies started out with Alice & Chez Panise.I highly recommend this book to any of you out there looking for a new one to add to your collection...look for a used copy as it is out of print. Enjoy!
1,Dishonest title,".The subtitle says this is a memoir. The early pages say it will detail Bradley's participation in the 1992 presidential campaign.Those are virtually the last times we hear about the memoir or the campaign.Instead the book is a seemingly unending series of diatribes--on water in California, Appalachia, American Indians, ethnicity.Eventually my eyes glazed over--another page, another complaint about what's wrong with America.Certainly there are many problems in this country. If I had wanted to read about them, I would have bought appropriate books.Instead I thought I was buying--as advertised--a book about Bill Bradley, a multiversed man. I was wrong. I only hope he treated his constituents more honestly than he does his readers."
4,Very well written,"Bradley does a wonderful job in this book of recounting not just his life but the lives of many others. He brings us numerous vignettes about individuals and their situations, from across the country and the demographic spectrum. He shows intelligence, morality and more modesty than your typical politician, admitting when he has erred or where he may still be wrong. You might not agree with all he believes (I don't) but it is obvious he has thought through his beliefs and is not just another sound-bite senator. Probably the best book by a politician I have yet read. Highly recommended for any American."
2,argh - an architecture of buzzwords,Please buy Moniz' book and not this one if you are interested in building a real architecture and not just experimenting with the latest buzzwords. XML is good but the author is too enamoured of the technology to tell you how to use it well.The other reviewers didn't miss the point - the 5 principles he outlined are important but not the most critical. Just read them and think for yourself if you don't believe me...
2,i have to laugh,"well after reading some parts of the books.I have to cry over my lost money. This books is taking you nowhere ,and I dont know what is the main purpose of this book.May be if you have enough time, take this book with you to the jungle or to a seaside perhaps. I can better peruse through many more sites in internet to get much better knowledge."
1,Better to read something else.,"I've read this book and it pains me. The title stated designing distributed applications yet it does not specify metrics on how good or bad the design is instead it proposed a particular design like using XML to be the transport mechanism between distributed component. Sure this is nice, yet the amount of traffic this will generate because of redundant data for XML would bog down efficiency. I would not recommend this book."
2,"Cheaply made costume, don't buy!","We bought this costume on sale on Amazon, but it wasn't even worth the price. The costume material is flimsy, the shinguards don't stay on. The mask reminds me of the cheap old-fashioned plastic Halloween mask of yesteryear. It doesn't stay on my son. He can barely see out the eye slits. I was so disappointed that when I saw a Power Ranger costume on sale at the Disney Store made of high quality material, with muscles and nice cloth helmet, I bought it. It was only $10 (on sale from $40). Don't waste your money on this one. Go to the Disney Store."
1,A Disaster of a Disaster Flick,"While the acting was tolerable to good (main characters only, the plot and special effects were not worth watching.Many of this genre are mediocre to fair at best, even the plot for 2012 could have been better. (I mean an old camper and a small plane just taking of sucessfully escapes the pyroclastic flow of a super volcano???? COME ON!!!)This film is a total waste of time and money."
3,Joe Lando & Claudia Christian---Not having sex in this film.,"Stars: Joe Lando,Claudia Christian & Cooper Harris.With the world as it stands today,This film and its ilk are most wanted.Needing to evaluate our day to day goals and wanting more from life is valued in this film.The special effects leading to what maybe the end of world are spectacular.Joe Lando is awesome as everyman,just wanting to reunite his family at lifes end,Perhaps.Claudia Christian has switched gears from femme fatale to a character actress with skills that bely the product she is in.Cooper Harris steals this film and any others in her resume,Wow...Look out Casting Calls,She should have the part !"
4,Live 1989 hard-bop session has many good moments,"Recorded live at Kimball's East in Emeryville, CA on May 26-27, 1989, fluegelhornist Art Farmer and saxophonist Frank Morgan are both in good form on this live quintet session. There are rewarding solos by the principal performers and pianist Lou Levy. Eric Von Essen on bass and Albert ""Tootie"" Heath on drums provide solid rhythmic support, and get in a couple licks of their own. This release offers a well-balanced set of nine tracks from the concerts, delivering extended versions of Art's own ""Farmer's Market"", Sonny Clark's ""Blue Minor"" & ""Cool Struttin'"", Charlie Parker's ""Donna Lee"", and the standards ""Star Eyes"", ""Embraceable You"", ""Don't Blame Me"", and ""I Remember You"", each ranging from almost six minutes to over nine minutes in length."
4,Never seen anything like this; Yakuza existentialism,"Japanese Noir? If such a thing is possible, I guess this is it. Although I think that the more recent Beat Takeda movies are closer to the classic American form that Suzuki's stuff. Am I detecting the influence of the French New Wave in this film? Existentialism seems to manifest itself in different ways throughout the film particularly in the numbering of the yakuza killers. I was amazed by the really strong erotic content but found some of the violence cartoonish (not neccessarily a bad thing). If you buy this, and I strongly reccomend that you do,don't try very hard to figure it out as you go along. Just ride along with it and it will take you to some very dark, and bizarre, places."
5,Interesting and entertaining,"An anti-hero hitman who sniffs steaming rice. How much more off-the-wall can you get?Suzuki does some amazing stuff with this movie. Weird and amusing editing, and interesting and funny sequences blended with disturbing action.I was amused to see that this film influenced Jim Jarmusch in his recent effort, GHOST DOG. There are at least two scenes from BRANDED TO KILL that ended up being reinterpreted in GHOST DOG.A very fun film, and another Criterion triumph."
3,an odd crime film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This move is one of the most odd gangster films I have seen.The film follows a gangster [who] is known as the ""number 3"" killer and is epeatedly threatened by the ""number 1"" killer.This film contains nudity to a degree of which I am surprised was legal in Japan at the time the movie was filmed. The film has several clever tricks by the characters to avoid being shot and there is some witty humor in the film also.The director of this film was fired by the studio after aming this film and was blacklisted for 10 years.The Criterion Collection DVD has 2 special features on it. There is an 11 minute interview with the director Seijun Suzuki, and a slide show of Japanese movie posters and lobby cards from the collection of John Zorn, who also wrote the liner ntes thant come with the DVD."
3,Odd,"This is a very strange movie. Maybe I just didn't understand it, so I hate to have to give a star rating.But I can say that if you're in the mood for a standard escapist action flick, as I was, this is definitely not it. This is NOT a Japanese language version of Bond, the Bourne movies, or John Woo."
5,"Engaging, very readable","My four-year-old son loves this book, and I don't mind reading it twice a night for months on end. The story is vivid and lyrical, and the illustrations are beautiful."
5,Bat Loves the Night - and My Kids Love This Book!,"This book is an incredibly rare combination of poetic language, valid scientific information, and beautiful illustrations. I bought this for my then 5-year-old, and she loves it...but my preschooler REALLY loves it, so much so that she now has a little bat hanging from the ceiling in her room. (Near the window of course!)Her father and I like it so much that we actively seek out other books by this author and illustrator."
2,Trash,"When I picked up this book I assumed it would be something along the lines of Bergdorf Blondes. Unfortunately, I was dead wrong. This book is just plain trash. I read just about anything but when the author feels the need to use the f-word on the second page of the book, I knew it was going downhill from there. I would just skip this book entirely. It's a wannabe book along the likes of the Shopaholic series."
3,It was just alright,I bought this book with great excitement because it sounded like a really awesome book. About 4 chapters in I knew exactly how the book was going to go and resigned myself to another impluse buy to where I probably shouldn't of bought the book just because of the reviews. To me the entire book felt extremely rushed and the relationship between the hero and his daughter was just WAY TOO EASY in the story. I mean he didn't even seem suprised when she showed up! I can't give it 5 stars nor can I give it 1 star so I'm settling in the middle at 3. It's highly doubtful that I will be buying another book from this author until she starts writing better and gets a new editor.
4,Great Author,We love Erin McCarthy's books. My daughters and myself read them all. Pleasent company on a cold night.
2,"Promising and funny beginning, mushy ending!","Okay, I admit I bought ""Heiress for Hire"" because it was on sale. And I thought why not try a bit of ""chick lit"". The first part of the book was funny and I could sympathize with our shallow, rich heroine but as the book progressed I saw where it was all heading and it all became the sappiest, mushiest, corniest ""romantic"" story ever. And the sex part went on endlessly. Actually, I skipped quite a few lines here. It was not hot or sexy, just plain silly.There are better books but this one is okay...especially if you want to take a big break from reality and want to give your brain a rest. Funny at times, mushy most of the times."
5,Loved It,"I recommend reading A date with the other side by Erin McCarthy first. Amanda Delmar's character makes an appearance in that book first along with Shelby Tucker, it will make Heiress for Hire easier to understand, plus both books are awesome!"
3,The book of web design with everything,This is the book of web design with everythingno other book needed for web design
1,If you know anything about html don't purchase this book!,This book boasted that it was for everyone from beginner to advanced. I found this to be completely untrue. I have a limited knowledge of html and was totally unimpressed. The CD also claims to have hundreds of templates. I found the templates boring.
1,"fellapart on me, the wheels could not even hold the weight if a jet ski trailer with out breaking...","used it a few times, then wheel broke right off, could not even hold the weight of a jet ski trailer with jetski....i guess im stronger then the hand truck or i just got a bad one...."
3,They do what they need to,"These are small mats made of thin metal over cardboard. Not very exciting, and not very versatile, but they keep a tea pot from dripping on the counter, which is what they were meant to do. Baking soda removes tea stains, but I've also seen it scour a textured counter smooth, so it's nice to avoid that."
4,Pictures of Peace,"Each of the 18 entries in this small book is a gem; a reproduction of a work of art (or a detail from a larger work), and her own comments interpreting them. She gives us many pictures of peace; landscapes, faces, abstracts, a stained glass window...and discusses in a few paragraphs what makes for peacefulness and what may look peaceful but is not. There's a lot of wisdom packed into just a few pages. I can imagine using this book for meditation and odd moments. It's the sort of thing one might read through in a sitting and then return to, bit by bit, over days."
2,Frustrating to use. Rough finish.,"I can't tell you how frustrating a tool this is to use. First of all, the tool looks cheap, it is not well finished and the tooling marks are evident. So long as it works then this isn't a big problem. Well, it doesn't work well. The first inch of travel is very awkward and stiff (I'm #220 and no weakling). What this means is you place the crimp on the fence line and prepare the tool for crimping; you get the tool in position to close the jaws; the first inch of travel is so stiff that invariably the darn tool moves before you get a grip of the crimp, the tool either slides off the crimp or worse still the crimp is knocked off the line and falls on the floor.I had just too many crimps to apply to mess with this. I went to the Ace Hardware store and bought a different model.This is just a bad design."
1,No Depth to Characters!,"The characters lacked so much depth to the point that this book read like a teenage mystery novel. I could hardly stand to continue reading. The conclusion was not chilling or psychologically stunning in any way. I will only give the author credit for 1) her talent in building atmosphere or setting and 2) her vocabulary. Otherwise, I felt that I was reading the script of a highschool play rather than what was supposed to be a mature mystery novel. It really missed the mark."
4,Great blended with fruit smoothie,I add the Chlorella powder in the green smoothies that I make and drink everyday. I add fresh garden greens and wild greens with some fresh or frozen fruit and then a tablespoon or two of the Chlorella powder and blend in a blender until smooth and creamy.
5,Dark Green is good,"I continue to buy this product over and over. It's simple to use and adds a touch of green to all my smoothies, even the green ones. If you are thinking of purchasing this product you are already aware of the health benefits. I have found the quality and taste to be consistent every time."
3,Great for a few weeks until I became violently ill from it.,"I started using this product about a month ago. I started with 1 gram then 2 then worked my way up to 3 grams. After about 3 weeks, my body totally rejected it. After some research, turns out his is a pretty common problem. So if you're new to this, I recommend buying the smaller container."
2,alright,"This product is ok, but spirulina packs more bang for chlorophyll content. The spirulina also gives more BM odor control than chlorella in my experience."
3,Good old school goth,"I bought this CD to help flush out my old school goth collection for DJ sets, and I think it's a good buy.I really like how Sex Gang Children has a different take on dark music, more of a weird French cabaret for a victorian-retro circus than the post punk melodies of Siouxsie and the Banshees or broodiness of The Cure. And I think this disk has some really good songs, I particularly like ""Last Chance for the Slow Dance,"" ""Sebastiane,"" and ""Barbarossa."" It's going to get plenty of play time on my turn tables.I'd recommend previewed this album (say on YouTube) before buying it because while it is a solid album, Sex Gang Children isn't for everyone."
2,Could have been good but .....,"This series had wonderful characters, and great animation. The music was good, and the voice acting was decent. The one major problem was that the show was glacially slow. For every episode there was maybe three minutes of action, and the rest was them talking. What made it worse was most of the stuff they talked about had nothing to do with the progression of the show. Also the ending was kind of rushed, and there were several things left unanswered. I usually rank an anime series by how likely I am to watch it again. It is highly unlikely I will ever watch this series again. I would suggest that you rent this show first, and if you like it, then you can buy it."
4,Very Enlightening,"I learned much about the construction of the Declaration of Independence, its meaning, the intents behind it, and some of the uses. This is a must read for anyone who wants to know the real story behind the Declaration of Independence. Much of what we are taught about it is too simplistic.The main drawback is that she jumps around a bit in breaking down the Declaration of Independence. It will be boring for those who only have a cursory interest in the Declaration of Independence."
2,Boring!,"I read this for a book group, and the consensus was it was a very boring book written by a woman who has an ax to bear against Thomas Jefferson. She admits in the introduction that she has voted for Jefferson as the most overrated person in American History. Her thesis is that Jefferson pulled together the Declaration from many different sources, that the Declaration was not an original document. She proves it, but does not help us understand the impact of the thesis. I did not come away with a lesser view of Jefferson's accomplishment."
3,good,"After reading the book, American Sripture: Making the Declaration of Independence; I felt the author handled herself perfectly and I also thought that the book was very informative."
3,"An important work, but not for everyone","American Scripture takes a detailed look at the construction of the Declaration of Independence. It compares/constrasts this important document with other documents (state declarations,etc.) and other works/writings of the timeperiod in order to see how Jefferson (primarily) constructed the declaration. It also looks at the editing process done by the 2nd Continental Congress. Finally it looks at how the document came to be revered and how it is/has been used for politcal purposes (slavery,etc...)Overall, it is an interesting read that sometimes gets bogged down in details and minor differences between the end product and sources used possibly by Jefferson. I would only recommend it for those that want to expand upon their background knowledge of the formulation of the Declaration of Independence."
3,Overly encyclopedic account of the Declaration.,"Pauline Maier should be commended for drafting this ambitious compilation of all that is known about the Declaration. The chapter focusing on the predecessors to and roots of the document was fascinating in that it is a subject rarely mentioned. The author secularizes Jefferson and the Declaration itself. This proves refreshing. Unfortunately, Ms. Maier's overly-analytical approach destroys the romance involved in the drafting of the Declaration. The most compelling chapters are those dealing with the great men sweating in the Pennsylvania State House. History without human emotion is often dull."
1,So bad its...........well bad!,"What can I say about this? If you like bad acting, losy songs and crappysets then this video is for you.enjoy!"
4,Missions of California,"I was very interested in the history of California and felt that had to include the history of the missions. There are several books on the topic; but since I had read and very much enjoyed Bill Yenne's book ""Indian Wars"", I ordered this book. It is well written and is thorough in covering the topic. It adds much to one's knowledge of the history and culture. The book has many wonderful color pictures of the missions. I certainly strongly recommend this book."
5,Great product!,"Use it for grey waste water on my lunch wagon. ***be advised that if you choose to cut any holes in this with the intention of routing PVC pipe, you will have to use a special type of adhesive, but when using the adhesive, I have had no problems."
1,not a book,I thought this was a real book too...I should have read about it more carefully. Its a spiral bound desk calendar. Not the format I was looking for.
4,7 times the fun,"I play Rock, Blues, Boogie and Hard Rock since 1967. I play a Gibson SG thru a Marshall AVT 150 half stack. I like this pedal a lot. It has 7 distinct sounds and each can be tweaked a ton by the tone and gain controls. You can add distortion and sustain to suit any style and it sounds great on the clean or gain chanels on my amp. I am geting a 9v power supply as the thing eats batteries every 3 hours or so. Built like a tank, got mine used here on amazon. The only thing I would add is the ability to program saved settings."
3,"Great Pedal, bad distributers","I wanted to get a distortion with various effects for a good price and the DF7 does the trick. I've been using a smaller crate amp so I am not sure on how clean it sounds on a bigger amp. I have tons of fun with this pedal, the only problem i had is that the company sent me the CF7, chorus factory, so it took me another week to get my product. Overall Great pedal"
3,It's an ok storage bag.,I needed something to keep the bike from scratching the sides of my car when I speedily drive down an expressway. The zippers are very well made and there is a separate flap inside the bag for the front tire. But this bag lacks padding on the inside. Overall it's ok. It does the job for what it's worth but it's overpriced for $100. I expected more for this price range.
2,Bike doesn't fit completely in bag,"I was a bit disappointed with this bag.I bought the Montague Navigator bike in the Large frame as I am 6'2"".That size bike is a tall frame, sized for someone my height, and the frame does not fit within the bag. The handle bars stick out and the seat stick up too far to even zip the bag.There has not been enough fabric allotted, when making this bag, to accommodate the Montague bikes in the larger frame sizes.More fabric, so that the bike could be zipped completely in -- concealing handle bars and top of seat -- and the bag would be ok."
5,Great Product,"This product is everything it says it is. It's a little hassle to slide the front wheel in its separate pouch, though not so much to complain about. There's a learning curve to handling the bike and getting it to fit in the bag. Once it's in, it fits like a glove."
3,Bike case,Great bike bag good quality but could not fit a normal road bike in. Appeared to be for a folding bike.
1,"Nice bike purse, guy","Are you friggin serious? Montague folding bikes are pretty cool, but why in the hell would they make a bike PURSE, and not a backpack-style case?In response to Chandler H. Joyner's review, yeah I understand that Manhattan requirement, but you can also have a backpack-style bag that will fully cover the whole bike. It makes no sense why something as unwieldy as a bike should be carried on someone's shoulder. Look at the picture, would you want to get on a crowded subway in the evening carrying a huge bag on your shoulder that almost touches the floor?"
2,Missing point of the bag,"The only way you are allowed to store your folding bike in the coatrooms of many NYC restaurants is to have it completely bagged somehow. Otherwise you have to lock it to something outside so you can worry about it while you dine. They infer that it is something about bike tires being unsanitary in a restaurant unless covered. Seems overpriced for what you get but maybe it is extra light, self-packs or has other attributes or features that give it additional value. Have ordered the bike and will take another look at this item after I use the bike some.I have to admit that the ""purse"" analogy seemed very apt when I first read it until someone I know in Manhattan advised me of the above requirement."
2,A real mess,"This product is difficult to work with, to say the least, even for an adult. I never had one egg look even similar to the package and I consider myself to be a crafty person."
3,Not Enough Color Plates,"I was very disappointed in this book because it doesn't have as many color plates of paintings as I had expected. I had expected something more like a catalog, but this book is mostly text and black and white photos.I haven't read the text. That's not what I was interested in."
4,"GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON, but PRODUCT NOT THE GREATEST","This is a decent price for these refills, and the free shipping is definitely nice. My only problem with these packets is that they don't last very long. They have been lasting approx. 2 wks per pack - so that adds up. They just don't hold very much toothpaste. But the toothpaste that they do contain, the fresh mint, is very good - good tasting and goes well with the sonicare.PROS: Tastes good, good price.CONS: Doesn't last long."
2,Expensive,"I bought the Sonicare Intelliclean. I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years with great results. I bought the new model expecting something better. The large size does not bother me. However, it is still beyond me how this model is better or different. The refills are expensive and last about a week. I am the only person using this brush. I do not see how this model is any type of improvement despite the hype."
1,Problems with blocking,The refills are a different consistency from the stuff that came with the original product pack (liquid tooth paste) and dry out within the brush dispenser. This means taking everything apart for cleaning every two days. The brush system is great but these reefills don't work.
2,"Is this a mistake, a joke, or a ripoff?",How does a book about storing solar energy written over 20 years ago have any relevance let alone be worth over $400.00. Especially since anything that you want to know about this subject is readily available via any search engine for free? I guess out of 7 billion people on the planet there must be someone dumb or rich enough to pay.
4,Classic Suzuki,"Tokyo Drifter is the second film by director Seijun Suzuki to be released to the Criterion Collection on DVD. It is about a reformed killer named Tetsu who enters into a battle with a rival gang despite his intent to do otherwise. Honestly speaking, this movie lacks most of the basic aspects of what one could call a ""plot."" That doesn't prevent director Suzuki from making a really wild movie that has snap and verve to it though. In place of plot he offers up 83 minutes of quirky humor, violence, and bizarre color effects mid-film. And somehow it mostly works. As with the previous Suzuki Criterion release, Tokyo Drifter, this disc is lacking in extra features and has a rather flimsy booklet when compared with more recent Criterion Collection discs. The sole extra feature is an interview with Suzuki which is a nice addition."
4,Awesome movie,"This is the psychedelic sixties at its most wild and most Japanese. It's hard to follow, emotionally hollow, manic, and wonderful. The colors and mise-en-scene and action and music are great. It's pulp madness at its best. It's kind of the coolest movie ever made. The director interview with Suzuki sheds a lot of light on what exactly was going on with him, the movie, and the studio. It might have had more special features, but what can you do?"
1,Incomprehensible,"While visually interesting, Tokyo Drifter lacks a cohesive story or any character development. It seems as if the editor removed the most important scenes. At one point in the movie the main character Tetsu has two hitmen in the back of the car he's driving and inexplicably escapes unscathed. The final outcome of the car scene is missing. This is just one of the many examples of poor editing. The subtitles on this DVD are equally disjointed and incomprehensible (laughably so, at times).This movie is for students of Japanese film only.[DW]"
1,Please just drift back to Japan where this film was made....,"A colorful explosion of boredom, complete with homosexual subplots between gangsters and their underlings. I mean, our protagonist is obsessed with his boss to the point that he literally ignores the advances of a sultry nightclub singer. Sure, the scenery is vibrant and Tarantino claims this is a ""masterpiece"" but so what. it is boring with little action. save your money: go buy a few cans of whipped-cream and head to the nearest carnival. It'll be much more fun."
2,Different Labels - Different Concepts,"Matsui Narada Jazz and Matsui GRP , with her partner Nakamoto are the same and , Are They ? . Yes , but Matsui GRP sounds like a bad remake of David Sanborn's Straight into the Heart with that GRP Generic Sound that really gives me the creeps . But , hey , that`s me . So , if it says by Narada Jazz , go 4 it , if not , well , I warned U ..."
5,Give it some more twist.,"Again this game is great to play. Easy to learn, easy to play. Get into character and it even gets better. Let the Dalmuti have some dictatorship and make the lessers do aweful things. Like when you have been playing for hours and feel you need a brake in the game call for a rest but make the greater Peon go for a half mile run and then when he gets back have him/her fetch you some drinks, but watch out because next round they could be in your seat telling you what to do. Wonderful game!"
1,Piece of crap!,"I recived this so called ""calendar"" in a broken cd case and it consisted of 12 pieces of paper with a picture of johnny depp. It was not put together at all just 12 individual pieces of paper put in a cd case and called a desk top calendar."
4,'Psychedelic Underground 3'- V/A (Garden Of Delights),"Cannot believe I'm the first one to ever review this various artists disc here.This import CD is the third in a series of ten(so far anyway)that gives interested listeners a chance to hear one track each from nine(9)different Garden Of Delight label releases,of mostly sub-underground bands that I'm sure most obscure progressive music fans,like myself has barely ever heard of.I've heard most every volume of this 'Psychedelic Underground' series and most are pretty decent.Best tracks here include Agitation Free's ""In The Silence..."",Siloah's ""Road To Laramy"" and The Crab's ""Change Bad Horizon""(reminds me of early Jefferson Airplane).Comes with an informative full color booklet.Very nice."
5,Spies on the Devils Belt,"Story about spies during the Revolutionary War!! Well written, much recommended reading during our visit to 3 Village Historical Society a short time ago.The Devil's Belt was L.I. Sound during that time! Imagine that being the link between L.I. and Conn. completed by historicallydocumented letters later revealed."
3,Kinda Boring but decent,I thought this book was kinda boring but it was decent. It took a long time to build up to the climax but when you got there it was quite good.
3,Excellent Heat X-Fer but So-So Mass X-Fer,I used this textbook for a few years when teaching a course in heat and mass transfer. The heat transfer parts are some of the best I've seen. Very clear explanations and great diagrams. The mass transfer material is not all that great. The authors are mechanical engineers but mass transfer is really the domain of chemical engineers. They're not as often clear (or even totally correct) in the mass transfer sections. There used to be a heat transfer only version of this textbook which might be a better buy. For mass transfer I would use any established chemical engineering textbook.
4,Thorough heat transfer book,"This is an excellent text for the heat transfer novice, both as a supplement to a class and as a personal teaching tool. The writing is easy to understand, and the chapters are arranged logically. The examples are well chosen and usually demonstrate how the theory and equations can be put to good use.I have only two complaints about this text: There are far too few sample problems (and no problems with only answers provided) and the mass transfer is not taught in a useful way. The prior is a failure of many text books, but the latter is a major drawback. Incropera and Dewitt basically say ""Mass transfer is the same as heat transfer, except use these units and equations."" All of the mass transfer is tucked into a few chapters, as if it was an afterthought.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the fundamentals of heat transfer, but look elsewhere for a useful introduction to mass transfer."
2,no answers,"this book is just so-so in content. May be excellent relative to its counterparts. But what really nonsense is no answers are provided in the back. Some would say no student solutions manual is fine because the problems are assigned as hw by professors. But not a single answer in the back is plain ridiculous. If the reader is so expert in solving the problem(hey no answer), they don't even need to read the book , NO SALE."
3,Too Much Theory,"Too much theory and messy equations. If you want to know all the gory details then this book is fine. But if you just want to solve H.T. problems as quickly and efficiently as possible then look elsewhere. In most cases you can get answers that are equal or more accurate by using tables, instead of fooling around with tons of messy equations. There are so many assumptions used in the equations that tables based on real-world data are usually more accurate anyway."
1,Simply awful copy of a good western - not watchable,This review is for the awful copy of the film on this poor excuse of a DVD - the review is not for the film itself.The film cannot be reviewed because this DVD by some comppany called Estree Hill is unwatchable.Dont purchace - youll waste your money. Torn tatered blotchy blurry Blech!
4,Very Helpful,I used this book with my social skills class for 6th graders. The lessons and activities are easy to use and understand. I adapted some of them to make them more interesting. The lessons relate to all students no matter race or economic class.
4,impromptu lesson planning bonus,This book has easily accessible lesson plans that develops useful social skills. It also serves incredibly well for impromptu lesson plans which can be expanded in other creative ways. good also for an advisory or with students struggling in terms of behavior within the school system.
4,Very helpful and actually helped my son with social skills,"This book is a series of lessons that teach different social skills. Although it's set up for a classroom setting, I've been doing them with my 8 year old son. I have been very pleased with the change I've seen in his behavior from doing these lessons at home. The book is very easy for follow for a non-educator such as myself and most importantly, it's effective!"
2,This book was disappointing,"The description said you could easily apply the skills and exercises at home, outside of the classroom environment, but it is clearly written for classroom use.The author doesn't really explain what to do with each exercise either, it's seemed more like a list of suggestions or ideas than real activities. For instance they would say ""come up with a story to show typical youngsters conflicting over a problem and give examples of how to resolve those problems without violence.""That's what I got the book for.... if I knew how to come up with scenerios like that and exercises on my own, I wouldn't need help.I gove it 2 stars because there are a couple of worksheets included that do seem like they are useful practices, but other than that, this was a waste of money."
2,Strictly Junior High material,These social skills' lessons are much better suited to the level of junior high or even lower. My high school students did not respond to these activities and thus the title's suggestion (grade 7-12) is misleading. I will not try these activities again with my grade nine students.
4,Social Skills,"I am a mental health therapist who works with adolescents with a variety of mental health needs, primarily deficient in how to perform socially with others and within community, school, etc. This book offers a simple interactive approach that reaches children/adolescents by incorporating a learning component and an interactive component. So far the social skills group I facilitate has enjoyed the use of each lessons in this book."
4,Lavazza Crema e Aroma Coffee,"I really enjoy this expresso coffee, it is always smooth, never bitteror over roasted to taste burned. It makes a wonderful cappucino, witha frothy head, it has a nice frothy head in just a plain cup of espresso.I highly recommend it and have ordered it a few times. It is also a greatprice."
2,Not To My Taste,"I knew I was in trouble with this coffee as soon as I opened the bag - beans were medium brown and dry, not that dark, lustrous finish I was looking for. I have tried several coffees from Amazon searching for a less expensive and more politically correct alternative to Starbuck's French Roast - Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster, Rocamojo French Roast, Java Trading Co. Seattle Dark Roast. The Lavazza was by far the worst of these coffees - weak and tasteless. Rocamojo French Roast came the closest, but not quite there. Fogbuster wasn't too bad. Java Trading was in last place until I tried the Lavazza. Should have known better than to buy a grocery store-type bean. Lesson learned...not too expensive a lesson since it was on promotion."
1,Not for household consumption,"Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for. At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops. Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee. I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice-grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail. DO NOT BUY this product. Stick to store-bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc. If I could get my money back, I would. I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices. I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product."
1,Not good,"I thought I'd try this coffee because it was marked down quite a bit. I was excited because it's Italian like Illy. I know Illy coffee, Illy coffee tastes good to me, this Lavazza Crema e Aroma is no Illy."
3,"It's Own Genre, Not Typical Expresso Roast","I bought this thinking these were typical expresso beans. They may be most often used to make expresso, but the flavor is unique. I was not familiar with the ""Crema"" phenomenon. Crema is apparently a flavor. Enjoyed the opportunity to try it, but I would caution those looking for their idea of expresso roast to try a smaller sample. If you don't like ""Crema"" flavor 2.2 pounds is a lot of trying."
1,*NOT* a Dark Roast! *NOT* an Espresso Roast. More like Medium; not flavorful.,"I bought this coffee expecting a dark roast to use in my espresso machine. I know it's an italian roast but it's much more medium to light than other italian roasts I've had. The color of the beans is similar to the top of the bag (a medium brown), not oily at all (in fact, they look completely dry). Whether this is normal or not for this roast, I don't know.All the other italian, and dark/full-bodied roasts I've had have been much darker, bordering on blackish, and have at least some oil on the bean surface.This coffee brews extremely light as an espresso. I'd say it's nutty and a bit sweet as well. Lacks depth & complexity. It is smooth, but so is water. There are no of those darker-roast flavors (smoky, chocolate, toast, etc.) or heartiness.If you're a fan of espresso, french roast, sumatra, and other bold/dark-roasts, this coffee is not for you. I wish I could return this."
3,Ok For Price - Not Very Strong,I purchased thhis on the Gold Box Deal for only $7.50 so it was a great price. I was a little disappointed with the streanth. I like strong dark coffee and this was not. But it was good.
3,good coffee,I like this coffee and it is very drinkable but too light what I feel is espresso. I expected much darker and oily beans with that telltale smell but this stuff is kinda like d donuts. Coffee does have significant crema though... not bad at all
2,"Not really a coffee pro, but...","My sister worked at Starbucks, so I used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion. I have a pump espresso machine, but only a cheap blade grinder, which should tell you that I'm only about mid-range on the coffee-snobbery scale. That said, I prefer the starbucks espresso to this, in spite of the drastic difference in price when I buy it retail. Again though, I'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much. I only know what I like the taste of. In fact, I only drink it in lattes. 4 shot lattes, but lattes none the less."
4,lavazza,"The beans arrived promptly but found them to be a little old. They did not have the aroma nor oilyness I expected. However, they still mad a pretty good cup of coffee."
1,Don't recommend,Wish I had listened to the few reviewers who did not recommend this. This coffee received an overwhelming amount of good reviews that I decided to try it. The flavor of these beans were dull and did not have much flavor.My husband and I ended up throwing out the beans and buying new coffee beans. I hate wasting but couldn't manage to force myself to drink this.
5,Another great coffee,"As earlier posted, Lavazza products are some of the foremost Italian coffees. It's delicious to those of us who appreciate quality coffee."
3,Not really a fan of this type of coffee,"I am trying many different types of coffee, and I don't particularly enjoy this type. Some people might but not me. It has a sour taste if you drink it black which is not too pleasant. The beans give off a roasted almost burnt peanut smell. The grind is very dry looking.When I took the advice of reading the packaging I made milk based coffees. Its a much different coffee then. There is still the sour initial taste, but the after taste is very sweet and caramely."
1,HORRIBLE Espresso!,"I had high hopes for this only to be VERY let down. I've had the Lavazza ""Super Crema"" (blue bag) and it was pretty good. This ""Crema e Aroma"" is some of the worst espresso beans I've tasted. The cream is decent but the flavor is thin and sour. I've tried different grinds, water temps, tamps, etc... nothing helps. I have been making espresso at home for 10 years using high-end consumer equipment so I know how to make good espresso... these beans are very lightly roasted, versus most beans I've used, and very dry out of the bag. Maybe the trip from Italy kills the beans? Either way, if you like good espresso... better than Starbucks quality, stay away from Lavazza Crema e Aroma."
4,Excellent coffee with delicate notes,"I use these beans in a Jura Capresso SuperAutomatic.Jura-Capresso 13289 Impressa S7 Avantgarde Automatic Coffee and Espresso CenterEveryone in our home likes the coffee because it has a refined taste. If you like a clear tasting coffee, with delicate notes, and a slight nutty taste, give this one a try. Coarseness of grind has a a very distinct impact on the taste, so be sure to try different grinds. I have noticed a slight variance from bag to bag as well, so if you aren't impressed, try a different lot. Also has excellent crema. Note also that the price for this item fluctuates frequently, so be sure to watch for sales."
5,Lavazza Coffee,"Just made the first pot this Saturday morning for the wife and myself. Used a burr type coffee grinder and used my drip type coffee maker.Used (3) scoops for 10-cups of coffee.The aroma was great, the brew was dark and rich and the taste was superb.So good as a matter of fact that we made an additional pot.If you like a hearty and fulfilling cup of coffee I highly recommend this coffee."
5,great coffe,"i have tried many coffe vean brands and Lavazza is one of my favorites. it makes great crema, aroma and taste"
4,Good for mild tasting espresso or Capucino,"I prefer a darker roast, this is a little lighter than Lavazza Rosso. Guests like it as it is nearer the true Italian experience than what is usually available."
1,Quite Disappointed!,"I thought this would be better, much better.I have a Gaggia espresso machine, and this makes the worst espresso. Lavazza in the blue bag is much better."
1,Really horrible,This is really horrible coffee. It is especially bad in an espresso machine. The taste is completely different than the Lavazza beans that come in a blue bag. There is a reason this brown bag is cheaper.
5,Lavazza Crema e Aroma,"Great flavor, aroma and crema. I prefer this over the more popular Lavazza Super Crema. I use this daily in an espresso machine but sometimes in a drip coffee maker."
3,Not What I expected,"I expected Italian coffee to be very bold, so I was incredibly disappointed that this seems so bland. Maybe I need to use more, perhaps double the usual amount per cup. I am following my coffee makers instructions and the coffee turns out very weak."
5,Very Smooth,"Lavazza is a brand with it's own signature flavor. It's worth trying if you haven't. It's consistently very good quality. This is medium, not a dark roast."
2,LAVAZZA CFREMA,I generally purchase Illy or Medaglia D'oro Espresso coffee beans and will be returning to those products. We found that the Lavazza beans lacked the flavor and aroma of the products we had been using.
3,Pretty Good Cuppa Joe,"These are good - but not great - coffee beans. I like a bit of a ""bite"" from my coffee, and prefer a really good French Roast - of which many are not ""really good."" Starbucks French Roast is one of the most consistent, but even their outrageously high-priced blend has disappointed me of late. The Lavazza is a more mellow blend, which I find drinkable but without that morning ""slap in the face"" you get from a heartier roast. Does that make sense?"
3,about authentic espresso flavor,"When it comes to espresso coffee it's all about authentic aroma and flavor. Lavazza is a good coffee but not the best. Sip it and try the after taste test. Then sip Illy,compare the after taste test,....see the difference..??Of course you 'll be a much better judge if you know espresso, not if you are the occasional user."
1,"crema yes, aroma no","Light roast, lots of crema, no aroma, little flavor. If you adjust the grind for a 25 secondextraction and increase the temperature a bit, you can get some espresso like brown substancefrom these beans, but still a little thin and sour."
2,A bit weak,"The coffee beans were not as dark roasted as expected, resulting in a rather weak cup of coffee."
4,One of the better Sandman spin-offs,"Another spin-off of a Neil Gaiman series, this first collection of The Dreaming does a good job of channeling the original Sandman scribe's devotion to nostalgia and the esoteric.Of the three stories, the best, by far is Peter Hogan's 'Lost Boy', about a time-lost British architect, the ages-old witch 'Mad Hettie' and the secret origins of America.Like Gaiman at his best, Hogan is interesting, well-researched and more than a little sweet. It still isn't Sandman, but if the rest of The Dreaming is this good, it is nothing to sneeze at."
3,It's not bad...,"...but it's not Gaiman. But then, Neil set the bar at an extremely high standard, one which few can match, especially with regard to The Dreaming."
3,"Not 36 inches, not by a long shot.","I can't say too much about this snake because it is for a Christmas present for my grandson. I thought the vendor sent me the wrong snake when I opened it. It is closer to 24 inches than 36 inches. It looks real enough, and it is designed to be posed, but I don't know why it is described as 36 inches. So, actually I'm not sure it is worth the price. We'll review it again when the grandson forms an opinion."
1,Not very tasty,"My Safari Incredible Creatures-""Cobra"" was not very exemplary. First off it was not the Mozambique Spitting Cobra as I was hoping for. The texture of the snake resembled more of a Northern Death Adder's scales. As I opened the package eagerly, my immediate survival instincts kicked in in less than .05 seconds and grabbed what I assumed to be a real cobra with my bare hands thinking that the ""cobra"" would have a slightly lowered reaction time. All of this unfortunately resulted three broken fingers and very bad tasting snake in my mouth. Can't return it because I couldn't find all of the tiny pieces that I shredded. Won't ever buy this again."
4,A. McDonald (Safari Incredible Creatures-Cobra),"Ok, I know this is strange, but I always write the reviews with the son and his response in mind. This toy does nothing special, BUT my son loves it...It is very life like, so this brings out questions from my son about where Cobras live, what they do..ect. so this increases the educational value. The durabilitiy is very high, the toy moulds to the shape you want then stays there, no breaking parts. Simply this toy is a very real, looking rubber snake, the ""real"" is specific to cobra and you get a lot of educational questions from your youngster. Like I said he loves playing with this snake, that he uses to attack his dinasours, transformers, and me. Price is high for no ""moveing"" parts. A real good life like biology durable toy."
4,The good and the bad,"The body back buddy is great. 4 stars. You can specifically target the area you want to massage. Short of having a massage by another person, this is a reliable product.1 star for the Da Vinci tool. The ads say it has a hundred uses, they should have printed them all. I could only think of about three. But with its limitation, it does relieve some stress when put on the occiput."
4,Great tool!,"The cards are very thorough and enjoyable for any ""greek geek"" around. There are 1000 cards, all with helpful terms. My only caveat is that extra phrases are sometimes added to a flashcard, usually asking about related forms of the word, making the cards clunky and less accessible for the more novice greek student. Still a great value and a must-have. Very effective way to learn. Currently, I'm memorizing 4 words a day."
1,A waste of money and shelf space,Save your money and just use a well organized web portal (like Yahoo!) The only purpose this book could serve is browsing while away from the computer.
4,The Best of the Best,"Most hard-core jazz artists consider The Rippingtons to be a jazz/new age fusion, and I can see why. This album, and most of their current releases, has a new-age overtone to it via keyboards and synthesizers. Most ""best of"" albums out there I feel are largely disappointing, mostly because what I feel is 'best', the record label people don't feel is 'best'. My first impression of this album was ""I miss Steve Ried!"". The percussion on this album is fantastic, thanks to Steve. I wasn't highly impressed with the 'never before released' track ""Garden of Babylon"", it sounds like something you'd hear during a car chase on Miami Vice. However, the second half of the album is excellent. You'll love ""Principles of Desire"" if you like subdued saxophone style. ""Vienna"" is a nice guitar duet that makes me smile regardless of my previous mood. Pick this album up if you're looking for some great all-around jazz music."
5,Terrific CD and group..,"My alltime favorite ""pop jazz"" band has got to be the Rippingtons. From an audiophile perspective, this material is extremely well recorded, as well as being lively, musically interesting and involving. My favorite song on the CD has got to be ""Vienna.""If you like the genre (or want to check it out), I can't think of a group I would recommend more highly than The Rippingtons, and this CD gives a good taste of what's available out there.P.S. to the previous reviewer who said he felt embarrassed about liking the group -- come on man, does everything you listen to have to be angst-filled ""art"" that has some supposed deeper meaning? I enjoy this group purely for what it is, relaxing kick-back type music that is involving and enjoyable (so much of this genre is utter junk , The Rippingtons are not)."
2,best of the rippingtons,i was disappointed in this cd..but i like the rippingtons overall..i have other cd's that i like extremely..that is about all i have to say..
3,Aural ambiance,"Hypnotic, but comparatively shallow tribal reflections upon the guitarists personalized approach adds a worthwhile though not (even while the final stretch compellingly argues to the contrary) necessary addition to a masterful musician's mysterious catalog."
4,From the sublime to the ridiculous,"I believe Jade Warrior's name reflects the Jekyll and Hyde nature of their music, Jade being the more sublime side to their song writing and Warrior the harsher grittier sounds. At their best, the band cut some just beautiful Jade, such as Windweaver and Dragonfly Day. But I can really live without the Warrior - songs such as Psychiatric Sergeant are just dreadful. Definitely buying for the Jade, but these songs contrast, sadly, with some real rubbish."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,WATCH OUT - BOTH THE INDIAN SET AND THE PADRE SET ARE NOT WHAT ARE PICTURED. THEY ARE BROWN PLASTIC FIGURES SIMILAR TO THE LITTLE ARMY MEN YOU BUY AT THE 99 CENT STORE THEY ARE TOO SMALL TO PAINT. THE PICTURE BEING SHOWN IS VERY DECEPTIVE. AMAZON SHOULD MAKE THEM POST A PICTURE OF WHAT YOU REALLY ARE GETTING.
2,Great idea! Translation glitch!,"Andre Rieu in Wonderland (incl bonus CD)Tremendous concept well done! It is easier to appreciate his music and his stated purpose (beautiful music to the masses) in all of his other CDs and DVDs than this one; the obscene translation glitch (sub-title)near the end has caused, and will continue to cause, difficult moments for parents who think they should share ""Fairy Tales' with their children. The production department in Holland does not find it objectionable and will, therefore, retain it. If this is your first exposure to Andre Rieu, don't be put off by this for he is the best thing to happen to music in a very, very long time."
1,Wonderland? Hardly!,"We have seen and enjoy so many of Andre's DVDs (Homecoming, Tuscany, Dublin, Christmas around the world, etc..). Wonderland was a terrible disappointment. It was simply too overdone with theatrics and took away from the music. Very disappointed in the DVD, had to send it back."
5,Andre Rieu for ever!,Andre Rieu in Wonderland (incl bonus CD)Andre Rieu in a wonder in himself. Faboulous presentation! Worth seeing more than once.
1,Andre Rieu Wonderland not good,"If you are wanting to see a lot of Andre and his Orchestra, this is NOT the DVD you want. If you enjoy mass confusion, loud music, and lot of different sets, many scene variations, hardly no interaction between Andre and his orchestra, hardly no waltzes, than you would enjoy this. I did not like it. I bought 3 of them, one for myself and two for friends and I am returning two of them and will sell the one I have. This is not typical of Andre and I am a die hard fan and I have EVERY DVD that he has made."
4,Muppet Babies Video Storybook VHS Video,"Description from the back of the cover:Three stories hosted and narrated by Kermit the FrogMEET THE MUPPET BABIES - Kermit is building something in the nursery. All the other Muppet Babies think they know what it is - but do they? BABY PIGGY AND THE GIANT BUBBLE - What would it be like to float in a giant bubble high above your town? Baby Piggy is about to find out! WHAT'S A GONZO? - Kermit's a frog, Fozzie's a bear, Rowlf's a dog -- but what's a Gonzo? Join Baby Gonzo on his journey of discovery.Video runs approximately 30 minutes."
4,Multiple CD's in each volume,"These lectures are as enjoyable as I found the ""Six * pieces"" series which have six CD's each.I delayed this purchase thinking that it had only two CD's covering volumes 1-2.Finding that it is actually a 12 disc set was a nice surprise. I'll definitely be buying more from this series."
3,probably much better in person,"I really enjoy Feynmann's books and his video lectures, but listening to him on CD just isn't the same. There are several times where he refers to his chalk board without really describing what the heck it is! A little frustrating. The ideas are good, but the complete picture is missing without visual references."
3,"'Psychedelic Underground, Volume 4' (Garden Of Delights) Various Artists","I give it 3 1/2 stars. Volume 4 in the Garden Of Delights series of breathing new life into long-lost sub-underground progressive, fusion and kraut bands. Best tracks on this 2000 limited edition pressing are Siloah's ""A Landlady's Desert"" off their 'Sukram Gurk' CD reissue (believe that Amazon-UK carries that title), Gila's space rockin' ""Viva Arabica"" off their fantastic archive live effort 'Night Works' (CD's absolute best cut) and Eiliff's jazzy ""Journey To The Ego"". In fact,the only tune here I didn't care for was Agitation Free's ""Deliverance"" off their dismal compilation, 'The Other Sides Of Agitation Free', for it was AF in name ONLY. Check this cosmic collection out for yourself."
1,not a good tip,"We purchased red, blue, black & white tips of this style. The blue ones broke more rapidly than the other colors. The reds & whites of this style were fine, but the black tips lastest longest."
1,I couldn't get into it....,I'll probably try again later to read it but I wasn't really intrigued by liza and jim's story in could it be magic. so I wasn't too thrilled to have their story in my possession.... it's just not my flavor... I don't know why but I don't think I meant to be a deirdre savoy fan...
2,Boring book,I bought this book thinking it would be a good beach read but I never really could get into it. The characters were boring. Way too much whining. The plot was very slow. I finally had to put it down.
2,Paper Dolls,"""...Chronicles"" is slightly entertaining because it introduces us to the infamous gift bags and their filling. Though sometimes witty, the characters generally lack depth and breadth and the ""stuff"" of which memorable characters are made. A disappointing -- but quick -- read."
3,Escapist Fun,"The Gift Bag Chronicles provides a sometimes humorous account of Alex Davidson, Hollywood party planner. Most of us have probably read these types of novels before- Stressed out L.A. life, boyfriend troubles, difficult rich people who demand ridiculous things, so on and so on. De Vries' novel doesn't really take a unique approach to this theme, and I felt that a couple of the subplots were neglected a bit at the end. However, I take the book for what it is: Good escapist fun that's easy to read."
1,so boring i couldn't get past the second chapter,"too many endless details and monotonous chatter and not enough story. if the book is about a party planner, why not start it at a party? i just didn't care about this woman or her boring life."
1,Had to force myself to finish the book,"I have read some bad books before, but never have had to talk myself into finishing one hoping it would get better. It didn't. Don't waste your time or money."
3,"good as audio book, lacked closure though!","I listened to this book - book on CD version... the narrator's voice was kind of annoying at times - when she was doing the various characters....The book was cute, easy to get into and relate... however, I was very disappointed with the ending! I sat there thinking, that's it?? What about this or that? So many unanswered questions and I didn't feel like Alex ""grew"" as a person through the novel. Kind of stayed in her old habits. All characters did - predictable I suppose. I'd recommend buying this one used... if you're looking for a very light read."
4,difficult return process,The product itself was excellent but way too large. The return cost more than the product itself. I maybe should have questioned the sizing before ordering
2,NOT HAPPY,The jacket is way larger than I expected it t be also it is way too heavy. the thing feels like it is lined with lead weight.
3,"Detailed stuff, but buy only if you're a knifemaker","First off, I have to mention that I am a knife collector and enthusiast. The names of the authors would be instantly recognizable for their work and reputation. However, unlike the Loveless book it was intended to compliment, this work reads as a dry, mechanical, how-to of building folders. Sorry, Ron I love your knives and I dream of someday owning one, but this book won't convert many people into 'knife-nuts'There is a lot of information here, but this book would probably be of interest to knifemakers. Also, not covering linerlocks, probably the most popular of the folder styles is a serious ommission."
4,About par for the many books on this subject,"I am a knife knut. There are three ""make a knife"" sections to this book. The authors - Lake, Centofante, and Clay are each well respected knifemakers. For a general idea of what goes into knifemaking this book is about average for the ""let's write a book for our fans who aspire to make their own"" book. It gives methods that each contributor goes through (learned after painstaking years of trial and error, hands on work). The text gives a pretty good description of each artists work, start to finish. As in most of the books in this price range and size, the pictures are not very helpful.You will not become a knife maker reading this or any of the books like this one. It does show you how much talent and hardwork and knowledge you need to make just one knife though."
5,Written by a woman with a great heart and guiding hands,"I'm happy Elizabeth has continued the momentum of the first Heart and Hands. I remember seeing her hard at work in her kitchen 'writers corner,' between taking care of her kids and helping San Francisco area mothers-to-be that were lucky enough to have found her. I admired her determination then to put together a book encapsulating the most important things a midwife and mother to be needed to know. I was lucky enough to witness her attending a birth once in the wee hours of the morning, and was impressed with her incredible blending of professionalism, sensitivity, instinct and grace. To see that translated into a text was a miracle, and she did it well. I haven't seen my copy of it in many years, as I loaned it to too many expectant mothers and one time it never made it back. *smiling* It is not only full of vital information, it holds some of the essence of the magic that is midwifery. I recommend it as highly as possible."
5,GREAT book,"I would recommend this book to anyone pursuing a natural birth. It helped me to understand many of the things that my midwife did, as well as to have faith in the strength of my body. Reading this before labor helped me to make it through 20 hours of back labor without even so much as an aspirin. I would highly recommend this book to parents-to-be!"
3,ok,I bought this in preparation to become a midwife but after plans changed I didnt need the book anymore. It was a good book and a good read. If you are interested in pregnancy and childbirth.
5,Heart & Hands,"Book is excellent. Gives wonderful insight into ""Natural Childbirth"" at home (not so much emphasis on hospital birth). I am talking about birth with little intervention. This book is an excellent guide in what to expect, how to handle specific situations, etc. Even touches on labor complications, how to become a midwife, and preparing a birth kit. Money WELL spent."
5,Fantastic!!!!,"Six stars if I could give it!!! Elizabeth Davis writes a very easy to follow, easy to understand handbook for almost any question regarding prenatal through post partum care with extensive resources at the end of the book. Fast read, outstanding work! Have lent it to a few friends already :)"
5,Must have for homebirthing parents,"As an unassisted homebirthing mother, I love this book. It gives a wonderful amount of information without giving too much. I have a copy of Williams Obstetrics and several other texts, but this is my favorite!"
3,"Good Product, Not Good Service.","I'm happy with the quality of the shirt, but had problems with service. I had ordered this with expedited shipping. Took about 8 days before they notified me part of the order was back ordered. I asked if they could change shipping or ship partial orders. My questions were not responded to. I finally got my order over 2 weeks later and was still charged premium (almost 50% of purchase price) for expediting shipment."
3,Buy it with the intention of waiting,"I bought it and waited, and waited, and waited.Finally when I gave up, it arrived.It's nice. Not great. The material is thin and a little scatchy, but over all okay.The wait time is beyond believe though. Apparently after you order it they hand make it right there and then ship it by horse back."
1,Classic volume but a flawed resproduction,This version of Favorite Flies is a reproduction of the original text - and essentially looks like a photocopy. Some pages are slightly illegible and there are no color plates of the flies. There is another version of this title that is much better.
2,Disapointed,"The book is basally a bound photocopy of the original, and at almost $50.00 was way overpriced. I thought the book was a reprint, guess I had better check closer next time. I think the description was misleading or in the very least it did not accurately describe the book."
2,Not your usual Joe Sample!,I purchased this album for one song and the rest of the tunes are not up to my taste or standards for Joe Sample!
4,addictive,I have been listening to george howard's jazz for about 3 years. I can't get enough of his smooth style and was shocked to hear about his death. I am still listening and collecting his albums and have not been disapointed with anything i have heard. His MIDNIGHT MOOD album is excellent. We have lost a great musician.
4,A Wonderful Legacy Of Music,"I have a confession to make: I was completely unaware this album had been released prior to Mr. Howard's untimely death back in 1998.Thanks to the miracle of MP3, I've made up for that laspe with the purchase of this great album. Having been a fan and seen him in concert back in the mid-eighties, it's obvious to see why some of the other reviews of ""Midnight Mood"" are so postive. The first three tracks, 'Within Your Eyes', 'Exodus', and 'Midnight Mood' pull you right in to this set, making life's problems seem distant and small. This album makes me miss George all the more. A deep void has been left in the Smooth Jazz world for 14 years."
5,Super girl! Super costume!,"We are a family of comic book junkies, so when we saw this costume, my poor daughter didn't even have a choice. So far, she's worn it to ""boo at the zoo"" and she looked awesome! So did the other girls wearing the costume... but it didn't bother us! It's very well made. The emblem isn't just a transfer, but a real patch. It also washed beautifully."
3,I thought they would like it,"I purchased superman and supergirl matching costumes. I thought my twins (boy/girl) would like them. Since they enjoy dressing up. They let me put it on so I could take pictures and then they took them off. They haven't touch them since. Not sure why. I like them they are so cute. They wear all of their other costumes batman, princess etc. Just not these."
5,Great!,My daughter loved this costume! It feels higher quality than some costumes sold around Halloween. It fits perfectly (my daughter is about 42 inches and weighs 38 lbs).
3,Super girl,My granddaughter loved the costume. She has been a Superman fan for years and we could not find a costume last year. I am sure she will play in the costume well after Halloween
2,Fits well but the seam is tearing after 3 uses,"This is a fun costume for our 5.5 year old daughter. The 'boots' are actually her favorite part of the costume. The belt is too big and is not practical to wear. The rest of the costume fits fine (she is of slighter build). The one thing I was not expecting though is that the seam around the neckline has already come apart and is tearing after 3 wears. Also, the velcro closure at the back comes open frequently. Not a completely satisfactory purchase. However, the shipping was fast."
5,Cute costume!,"We ordered a medium super girl costume for our 6 year old. She normally wears size 6-7 shirts from the Gap but she is also tall. The boots are very flimsy and don't stay up but the rest of the costume is great and fits well (the skirt is short but she only wears it indoor, she will need tights if she wants to wear it out so areas are covered properly). My daughter loves to dress up and has had lots of fun using this costume. So far (after 3 weeks) the costume still looks great, there is no damage to it and she sometimes wears it all day long. Overall very cute!"
5,Made will,This costume is better than others because the material is much nicer. It is not flimsy. And my 4 year old loves it.
5,Excellent S/W Project Management Book,I had been using the second edition of On Time Within Budget but this third edition is a major improvement. Especially the epilog that gave me a great summary of how to implement the theories in the book. The book is excellent as a reference source and includes almost all the information I need to run a software project. I found the summaries at the end of each chapter to be a great help. The section on estimates is one of the most useful I have read anywhere. Only criticism is that it should be hardcover.
1,Misguiding,"I had considered using this book in my Software Project Management class but have decided to have my students read others and stay away from it. On Time Within Budget positions managers as handling mostly technical decisions. Alas, many of these issues (to give just one example, selecting a client-server environment, section 7.4) have little to do with people and should be handled by the chief architect. Most projects where the manager has marginalized the architect or has been trying to wear the architect's hat fail miserably. If you want to become a good manager, look for books that tell you how to deal with peopleware. Get the right people, make sure that they can work at their best, and leave the technical decisions to the ones who can handle them best."
5,"Did the job, easily","This was far cheaper than a comparably sized tool at the home centers and seems to be very similar in quality. Well, hard to tell the quality, really, without using it much more and I do expect it to last 10+ years with my light use. I needed to cut off a Brinks padlock (same size as a standard master lock padlock). This bolt cutter went through it very easily. I am sure it could cut something even larger and stronger."
2,Item came with crooked jaws,"The bolt cuitter came packaged neatly and well protected. Unfortunately the cutting jaws came in crooked - not lined up properly - poor quality control. It was so obvious, I would never ship an item like that. The good news is that I am sure I can adjust them."
3,Not for Pad Locks or Master Locks,"FYI, if your getting this bolt cutter to remove padlocks/master locks don't bother. This tool cannot cut through any kind of carbon or hardened steel.Would have definitely returned the item if I didn't mar the tool while trying to clip an old lock."
2,Did I Read The Same Book?,"I purchased this book because of the 4 and 5 star reviews I read. Not sure if I got a different book from everyone else but I was not at all impressed. I didn't feel any connection between the hero and heroine. They were bland and boring with no passion. I would have given 1 star but I actually did finish the book so that warrants 2 stars. Usually, when a book is this dull I don't finish it but, I valiantly slogged through to the end. I was trying to find what all the glowing reviews were suggesting. Wasn't there. NO PASSION, NO ROMANCE, NO GOOD, DULL, DULL, DULL."
4,music for walking- move to the music,"It was hard to find something that I could walk to on the treadmill. So I took a chance on this one and it turned out to fit the bill. The pace is quick but not a ""killer"". Use it everyday!"
3,Good book but flawed by serious errors,"Generally speaking good book, but I found an error which can be considered very serious. The author states that satellites in GPS system are in geosynchronous orbit which is simply not true (GPS system based on geosynchronous orbit satellites will be not usable near poles). I was really disappointed when I've found such curiosity in an overall interesting book."
2,Plas Johnson? Not necessarily...,"This is a bootleg CD, with no royalties going to any of the artists for performance, or songwriting. The material is vintage Plas, but only about half of the tracks are Plas Johnson."
4,one of the best hardcore records from the 90's,"along with unbroken's ""life. love. regret."" this is one of the best hardcore records out there. while hardcore was going very metal around this time (not a bad thing necessarily - see unbroken) mouthpiece remained completely undiltued old school hardcore. of course other bands have covered this ground in the earlier days of NYHC, but What Was Said clearly stands up to the rest of those amazing records. ""can we win"" is an ultimate hardcore anthem. and many of the other songs shine as well for lovers of good old school styled hardcore. check out other things from new age records for lots of other good hardcore from this time..."
5,IT WAS LIKE LOOKING INTO A MIRROR-I COULD BARELY PUT IT DOWN,"I identified very strongly with the main character as will countless numbers of 'sistas' who find themselves in the white-washed, white-collar world of 'caucasia'. It is a must read! Kim McLarin is a very talented writer & definitely one to watch!"
5,"Obviously, written from the soul!","As a black woman who has been force to ""straddle"" the same fence, I found myself nodding throughout the book. Hope's story is a great insight into the feelings of anyone who has been forced into another culture, while attempting to hold on to their own. It was refreshing having it put to print."
4,"Witty and absorbing, a very fast read","A funny, compelling novel about a black journalist struggling to control her anger before it destroys her. The main character Hope is edgy and sassy and smart, very likable, even when she's about to go off the deep end. I could relate. The other characters are not as well-drawn, but Hope grows throughout the book and in the end learns an important lesson. A good book for anyone who has ever thought they were about to lose it at work."
1,Bitter!,"Frankly, I bought this book only because it was my bookclub selection because from a brief perusal of the story it left a bad taste that soon left me choking on the main character's bitterness - I felt like gargling after each chapter just so I could read the next. Turns out I was not alone: The entire book club disliked this book. We thought the handling of the main character made her seem psychotic about race, slapping folks, and ""the sun shining on her..."" blah blah blah. We didn't even finish the discussion questions before moving on to something more pleasant: Like an airplane crash. Lighten up, Ms McLarin!"
1,I'm still waiting....,"Waiting for this story to get somewhere, anywhere!!!! The book was completely flat from beginning to end. I would say the most exciting part was the pregnancy and even that was just like.... over??? I couldn't really figure out what this girl's problem was? What could have may her so bitter, Astor? Well, probably but the author didn't explore enough of the happening at Astor to show that to the reader. None of the relationships with Malcolm, David, Travis, Stephanie, for that matter, any of them were explored, resolved, or thought out. I think the relationship with Stephanie could have been much more powerful had it not been lightly brushed over. I gave this book 1 star, instead of no stars, because the mother's character reminded me of so many mothers I know."
3,Kim McLarin...A Work in Progress!!,"It would be easy to be nitpicky and point out those aspects of Ms. McLarin's work that were still a little rough around the edges, but I choose to focus on the positive and say that Ms. McLarin tackled a very timely issue and illustrated it both sympathetically and without apology. TAMING IT DOWN illustrates the emotionally quagmire that many African Americans face when circumstances afford them the opportunity to move up and move out of their black community. As is the case with Hope, they are many times left feeling torn and displaced. Hope's emotional meltdown along with her quest to find herself and determine where she fits in the overall scheme of things has a kernal of truth that has to strike a cord in the consciousness of many African Americans. All in all, this was a good first novel. I hope to see much more from Miss McLarin."
3,While reading I was thinking what is the point of this story,"The main character is a black woman working in corporate America. She only faces what others are facing, but the the majority don't whine and moan about it. They cope, they get over it and that is what I was thinking HOPE, get on with your life! The main character sound like a spoiled child instead of a professional black woman. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen to her and it never did. The best part was when she went to visit her mother and her mother made her go to the job with her. Hopefully the next book will be a little more exciting!"
3,False and/or Misleading..,"I was looking for the extended battery for the i500 phone (Model #BEX119GSE) and believed this to be the same one.Two issues.1. It is not the OEM battery as the OEM battery has Samsung stamped on the casing.2. The OEM extended battery (Model #BEX119GSE) is 1600mAH. This battery is not.The reason this is false and/or misleading is this battery claims to be the ""BEX119GSE"" and it is not. Here is the break down of the OEM batteries, and where this one fits in (as found on the web).Manufacture Used-In Model # Chem Volts mAHSamsung SPH-I500 BSL1198SE Li 3.6 800Samsung SPH-I500 BST119BSE Li 3.6 1100Unknown SPH-i500 B-7703 Li 3.6 1400Samsung SPH-I500 BEX119GSE Li 3.6 1600The only reason I didn't put one star down is because it's a 1400mAH battery for $35. Not a bad deal, I just wish they wouldn't have claimed it was the BST119BSE."
2,not great,"I first heard this piece on Ultra.Dance 02 (disk 2) mixed by DJ Encore... nice tune, but this cd is ruined for me by the female vocal calling out ""close cover"""
2,reruns are so disappointing!,"I imagine there are already used copies of this brand new book for sale because if you are a ME fan, you've seen it all before in the magazine. It's really annoying to open a new book by a favorite author to find that you recognize the material on every page! To some extent the last book by ME, ""Paint"" presented the same situation...lots of reruns, but this one has even more used material. I wish authors would reveal that previously published material is being used in a book. Most true ME fans are always hungry for more, I hope she gives it to us in her next book."
2,A Mary Engelbreit Re-Do,Disappointment as I am a charter subscriber to Mary Englebreit's magazine. Subscribers to Mary's wonderful magazine entitled Home Companion should note that much of this work is reprinted from the magazines. This should've been stated so unsuspecting buyers wouldn't repurchase what they already have. If you don't subscribe to the magazine this would be a wonderful book to own. It is filled with great photos of inspirational ideas for incorporating into our own homes.
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of ME and her magazine, Mary Englebreit's Home Companion. I received this book as a gift, and was excited, since I would have bought it for myself. However, most of the photographs have already been used in the magazine. Very few were new, so there was not much new inspiration generated."
2,Note if You have been a subscriber to Home Companion,"Unfortunately this book ""recycled"" alot of content from back issues of Mary Engelbreit Home Companion magazine. Not much here for Mary's loyal subscribers. Mary, why didn't you offer us something new?"
4,homes with personality,"This is a beautiful book showcasing homes with personality. The rooms aren't all ""decoratory"" and precisely ""country"" or ""traditional."" Judge the book on its own merits (which are many), not on the basis that the photos have appeared in a magazine before."
2,mediocre,"The book might come in handy for players in the 1200-1400 category. For players over 1600, I'd suggest the relevant chapters of ""Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual"", plus the volume titled, ""Rook Endings"" in Averbakh's ""Comprehensive Chess Endings"". If more depth is required, then Smyslov and Levenfish's ""Rook Endings"" and Nunn's ""Secrets of Rook Endings"" (The last is a bible on R+P vs. R)."
3,Zirconium Oxide paper is more effective,"I had been using 80 grit traditional sandpaper to strip exterior house paint. I am using a pneumatic sander capable of 12,000 rpm and a 2 inch hook & loop pad. I switched to 50 grit ""Gator"" Zirconia and immediately noticed an improvement. I thought I might get even better results if I dropped down to 40 grit.I ordered this 3M hook & loop disc and cut it into 2 inch sizes.The 3M; 40 grit was not nearly as aggressive as the ""New Gator"" Zirconium Oxide"" 50 grit. So when I thought I might gain some time by switching from 50 to 40 grit I actually lost abrasiveness instead.This is good to know for future purposes.Zirconium Oxide is more effective at stripping exterior latex house paint than traditional sandpaper."
5,Perfect Hot Rod Skis,"I have skied my entire life, but finally found myself with 15-year old ski equipment. After using a DEMO of the Eliminator, I loved it. The skis are wider than my old Rossignol's (195cm length) and shorter (178 cm length). This makes it much easier to turn. They also don't `flop' or vibrate like the old skis. I would advice these, as though I am an expert skier, I usually don't find a lot of powder skiing in Northern California. Most of the trails are groomed and these skis handle really, really well. For those few days I did find powder (3 feet, one morning), I could glide through it was amazing ease. It took no time to get used to these thick boards. I got an entire package so the Marker 0311 Twin Cam bindings are easy to step in and out. They call this an intermediate ski, but I've pushed it hard and it really performs. Check the price too - very competitive."
5,Outstanding,Another in a series of great Jazz Samplers. I recommend all of these highly. Check out Vol 1 especially.
5,"The inspiring ""prequel"" to _Ecotopia_","A fictional account of the events leading up tosecession of the Pacific Northwest from theUnited States. The book interweaves thelives of several people: a young inventorof a new solar cell who decides to put herinvention in the public domain rather thanmarket it; a politician who breaks fromestablishment politics to form a new ecologicalpolitical party; and several grassroots environmentalactivists. As their lives progress theiractivities lead up to the formation of the newnation which was the topic of Callenbach'sprevious novel, _Ecotopia_. If you enjoyedthat book, this one is a must read as well.If you haven't read it and want to know whatthe fuss is about, I would recommend thatyou read _Ecotopia Emerging_ first and thenread _Ecotopia_. An excellent book on several levels."
3,Not as good as Ecotopia,"I found this book very slow going and I became impatient. It's interesting as pre-history, but I would recommend Ecotopia much more. I didn't like the convention/arrangement of the book. It didn't seem to work as well as the convention of the reporter in Ecotopia. Oh, well. Still interesting."
2,Ecotopia Emerging,"I found this novel hard to get into. In ""Ecotopia Emerging"", Ernest Callenbach, uses multiple stories to express his political ideas of his time. All the stories eventually converge to the Survivalist Party. The Survivalist Party is created by ex-politician Vera Allwen, who is tired of the way the world is treated. Instead of trying to reform the whole world, the members are more keen on creating their own ""ecotopia"" where they can treat the enivironment good. The way the novel is broken down into different stories makes the novel lose its appeal. I was however, amazed at the accuracy of some of Callenbach's predictions. I feel that if Vera Allwen was into protecting the world as much as she claimed, that she would have tried to save the world as a whole, instead of a section."
2,Eeek-otopia I'm Purging,"Personally, I don't like to read about people trying to change the way things are because I enjoy my life the way it is today. At this present moment I am happy with the way things are in the world because I feel like even though I know that they do have an impact on my life they do not directly affect me so why bother. The only thing that that is going to do is stir up trouble and cause commotion. But if you like to read about changing the way the world uses its energy and and resources I would strongly encourage you to read Ecotopia Emerging. But personally it was very difficult for me to get into this book."
1,"Ecotopia, I don't think so","In this particular novel Ernest Callenbach tries to really show his interest in how much better the world would be as an Ecotopia, but I feel as though many of his points would take so long to actually progress within our society that we wouldn't get anywhere from an ecotoia.This book is about a girl by the name of Lou Swift and she builds a solar cell as an alternative way of energy. She ends up joining an organization that wants to form an Ecotopia. Some of their rules in my opinion were pointless such as, ""no private car ownership, no production of carcinogens, and other rules that to me were off the wall.I feel that the only reason you should read this book is if you are into the whole Ecotopia idea or you have to read it because your teacher told you to. Otherwise, I feel as though the book was a complete waste of my time because I didn't agree with any of the points that the author made about Ecotopia's and it was a slow paced book."
4,So great!,"This little seat that sits in the tub is amazing. My son hated the infant tub. It was hard and hold. This is soft, mesh and he just sinks right in and loved the bath right when we started using it. Hey, the price is right, too!!"
5,simple and useful,"Fits in your kitchen sink for the first several months. Baby stays put and it contours the baby's body. You really do not need anything else. There are no bells and whistles, but it is truly a useful bathing product. I will use it for #3..."
4,good enough for my 2 boys,"This worked well inserting into an infant tub or a large sink. Easy to remove the mesh to wash and soft for our babies to lie down in - I was able to keep one hand free to bath while the other held onto the baby. Of course, the only draw back is that while baby is lying on his / her back, you can't reach back there. I still had to hold them up for the rear-part cleaning."
5,Baby absolutely loves it!,"My daughter didn't like the tub we got her because of all the plastic part in it. Bathing her was not fun for neither of us.I bought Ez Bather and since then she demands her evening bath every day!She is absolutely free to move in the water (but won't fall off it because of its design), the fabric is very soft to her skin, she is soaked deeper in the water and she's not getting cold.Perfect for baby and mommy!Only setback is that she used to slide down from it. I wrap rolled hand towel around the Ez Bather to act as a ""stopper"" for her tushi and since then this is just perfect!I'm still giving it 5 stars because she loves it so much."
5,Mother of Twins,We used this little tub when traveling with our 6 month-old twins! It was great as it folds up flat and is so easy to travel with. It's very lightweight and so easy to use. Great buy!
5,Works like a charm,"Works as advertised, no problems or issues. Seems bulkier and heavier than needed. My older Garmin card reader is smaller and lighter for travelling."
1,Beware -- this will not work with USB 1.0 and some USB 2.0 chipsets.,"Most USB 2.0 devices are backward compatible with USB 1.0 interfaces. This is not one of them. While I have not seen any published specs that specifically say it is *not* USB 1.0 compatible the read me file on the driver CD explicitly states that it requires a 'pure' high speed environment. If you check the Garmin FAQ file for this device (recommended) you'll also find that there are problems with non-Intel USB chip sets. Sure enough, when I tried this on a different computer with an aftermarket USB 2.0 adapter card, no luck there either. Probably works fine with built-in USB 2.0 on name brand computers, but this is the first USB device I've ever had this kind of problem with, so that's why I'm giving it just one star."
2,IT DOESN'T FIT WELL...,"Maybe this gadget it fits in Pearl drums' hoops, but it doesn't work on the rest of the brands. I bought it because i wanted to make my 16"" TAMA Floor tom as a bass drum but this thing doesn't tight well as it should be...it hangs loose...I tried on a 16"" Ddrum floor tom, and the same story...Good for the Pearl Users, bad for the rest of us, i will have to sell it in order to buy another thing..."
2,Not the best,"I did learn a lot about JSP from this book. I learned how it works and the history of it. I did not, however, learn how to write JSP. This book touts hand-ons but their idea of hands-on is pasting several pages of code in the book and telling you to write it verbatim in your code. It goes over some good tools (such as Ant) but never mentions an IDE or what the best way to go about starting a project is. For the most part it moved very slowly and repeated its self a lot. The book is about twice as long as it needs to be. I do feel like I learned from this book but overall I don't think it was worth my time."
2,"Beginners book, it is NOT","I bought this book expecting that it would be a beginners book, in that it would start you off with some basics and move on from there. I also expected that due to to its size and content, it would be an adequate reference when I progressed beyond the basics. I expected this to be a fairly ""easy read"" since I have substantial backgroud programming in ASP. Unfortunately, the book is fairly disorganized and cotains a fair amount of technical rambling. Definitely more confusing more than educational.In essence, I consider this more of a reference manual than the learning book that I had hoped for and I will be buying another beginners book."
2,Not good at all,"I'm about 180 pages into this book, and if the next 800 pages are anything like the first 180, this is not the way to start using JSP. I also have the Ivor Horton Beginning Java book (also by Wrox), and it is a far better tutorial. After going through 5 chapters in both books, the Ivor Horton one actually taught me something whereas this book stammers on about how great JSTL and EL are without giving any good explanations of anything. The examples in this book are childishly simple AND not very well explained, which to me is the worst of both worlds. If you're brand-new to server-side programming, you'll wonder why after 5 chapters you still can't do anything. If you're familiar with other server-side languages, you'll wonder why they included the first 200 pages.If you want to learn Java, go with the Ivor Horton book. If you really want to learn JSP, I'd look elsewhere.I may update this review after going through more chapters - maybe it's just the intro that's poorly done."
4,Another twisty tale!,"Love the spinning of a great love story. Makes you stop and wonder, is he the one you've been looking for?"
4,Jill Mansell's loveable characters,"Jill Mansell's characters make the plot work well. The plot may be totally whacky in that some of the events are from way deep in one's imagination...could never have happend...etc. However, the caliber of the characters make it believable and things run through reasonable set of solutions, until a resolution is developed. Then they all come to rest at a realistic spot.I love the way her characters interact with each other. Even the most angry of friends are brought back into harmony.I think I will continue to try out Jill Mansell's books, and, hopefully find the next and the next and the next enjoyable in equally different ways."
3,Good but could have been better,This book was filled with tons of charming characters and was a good read. but i do admit there was slow parts and lots of out of this world happenings that seemed just way over the top. I would still recommend this book I have always been a fan of hers. Cheers!
3,It's pretty good.,Not my favorite of her books but it was entertaining. I wish it had been longer. A good light read. I laughed a lot.
2,a slog to get through until i had to stop,"i love chick lit as long as it is well written and has a bit of humor. this is written well enough and begins in a way that encouraged me to buy it. however, i finally gave up. it went on and on and simply made me tired. there are promising characters and situations which were strung out so long that i gave up skipping ahead to find out what would happen. i finally didn't care."
4,"Clever, funny and a great story.","I have read several books by Jill Mansell and I have to say, I love the tittering that is typical of Brits and is so well done in this book. I love the characters she creates and the way that she brings several stories within the story together. This book is ""brilliant."" I would have given it five stars save for the ending. I don't want to give it away, but there was one little tidbit that didn't seem quite sewn up and I was hoping there would be an exchange on the matter. It is important to point out that in my opinion this is not a riddled with romance novel, but is lighthearted and geared towards relationships or the lack thereof. How real life happens. I'd definitely recommend this along with any other Jill Mansell novel."
4,Good book!,"I laughed so much while reading this book. All of the author's novels are great romantic comedies. I'm usually able to predict the ending immediately, but I was kind of surprised."
2,Not a Fan,"All I have to say is that I was IMMENSELY disappointed with this book and the money that I wasted on purchasing it. I felt no connection to ANY of the characters in the book. The first few pages were treacherous to get through. The main character Poppy is out for her bachelorette party, more or less stubs her toe, and some guy Tom comes to the rescue and she immediately realizes by looking at him that she should call off her wedding which is the next day. And while looking in his eyes as he massages her stubbed toe, she thinks the word ""LOVE""?? Seriously? Aside from this being extremely hard to believe, it made me wish that I could return the purchase because it was beyond awful!"
4,A fun and bubbly read!,"What are the odds that you would meet the man of your life at your bachelorette party? That, of course, would mean that the man you're about to marry isn't the one, wouldn't it? That's what happens to Poppy Dunbar. On the night that she says goodbye to her single life, she meets a charming doctor. She is smitten. It is love at first sight. There is one problem: she will be married the next day. What is she to do?This British romance is a quick and enjoyable read. Keep in mind that this isn't meant to be a thought provoking and literal novel, but one that hopeless romantics could enjoy. I highly recommend it."
3,Just mediocre,"While I really liked the book in the begining, I felt that after the first half, it just slowed and dragged on and on... Claudia's relationship with Jake proved more interesting for me than Poppy's perhaps because Jake was a better developed character than either Caspar or Tom. Dina was irritating and unlikable to say the least, and it speaks badly for Poppy that she had been friends with a person like this for the past years. But then Poppy does seem to be a bad judge for people, since she falls for one wrong man after the other (Rob Macbride included).I've read my share of chick-lit books and this one falls short even for this category. I'll try reading another book by Mansell though since she has so many devoted fans and her writing style was nice indeed, it's just this particular storyline I didn't care for."
1,Not worth the price tag,"Very cute but not worth the price. The leather strap is stiff and I broke the decorative stitching within a week.. I also thought the bag would hang down a little lower. It's practically jammed up my armpit. It's roomy enough inside. Has two side pockets DO NOT fit a cell phone (I have a slim compact LG with a little bit of an antennae. I can't snap the pocket closed. For all it's worth, save your money."
3,pretty good sling shot,"this is a good sling shot bunch of power the bands are getting worn after a cuple months and i had problems with the weights they dont do much but help it look cool the one under the handle fell off also the sight sucks and i could not zero it in, but over all a good slingshot."
2,Got 100 shots before the leather broke,I liked the look and the feel of this baby. Coolest looking and light and easy to handle. My 12 year old daughter was shooting like a pro in no time. But.... the leather broke after about 100 or so shots. So there it sits un-used. Poor quality only 2 stars . Yea the price is cheap but so it the workmenship so I would suggest that if you buy plan on a throw away after a little use. Shame becasue this has some real power and accuracy.
1,Worst Chinese Slingshot in the Market,"Worst slingshot in the market, cheap Chinese made, after opened the package noticed rusts on some metal parts.Wrist brace did not last even 30 minutes and immediately the plastic parts fall apart.Adjustable sight is just gimmick and no use.Cheap Wal-Mart slingshots for under $5 perform much better than this one.At the end do not buy this one, poor job, very poor design, and poor quality check by Barnett."
3,Poor quality pouch,Overall I like the Diablo II. It's fairly powerful and accurate. I'm not convinced that the stabilizers add to accuracy though. More importantly mine came with a cheap leather pouch that ripped on the first day of use after only 30 shots or so. It's been on the shelf ever since as shipping on new bands costs more than the bands themselves.
3,Interesting,"This video is quite interesting whether you agree with the political views presented here or not. Freedom of speech is protected, hypothetically, for all points of view. Sometimes that is hard to accept when it's a 180 on your beliefs."
1,storm,"was not great. had loved the first compact disk had gotten by vinnie james,in fact had bought one for several people as gifts. This did not follow the great music of the first one. Played it once and that was enough."
4,A relationship with yourSELF.,"I was introduced to this book by a therapist who was a practioner of Psychosynthesis Therapy. He's been gone for many years; but he left me with a lot of simple wisdom about what it means to become whole and authentic. This book was written about the originator of Psychosynthesis theory and includes many meditations, imagery practices, and other pathways to the essential self."
3,Provides Context But Falls Short,"Marion Collins provides valuable context to this complex case but falls short in two respects. First, the author does not adeuqately describe the brutality of the initial assault. The truth of what occurred is not matched by the author's narrative. Second, and perhaps this is another book altogether, the author does not do justice to the drama and importance of the murder trial. The ""lawyering"" on both sides was extraordinary. To be fair, the murder trial (and subsequent appeal) is a story that could stand alone.Nonetheless, one learns a great deal more about the personality and character of the people involved. Perhaps the problem is that this crime deserves the same attention as the Tate-LaBianca murders received in Helter Skelter. Vincent Bugliosi would have had a field day."
3,LACK OF STRUCTURE BUT FASCINATING,"While the story was fascinating, the author's lack of structure was often distracting. No paragraphs where there should have been......and she often got ahead of herself in telling the details. The facts were interesting though. Worth reading..."
3,While She Slept,"Frightening story of marriage for the wrong reasons, hanging in ""for the kids sake"", and in-laws from hell. There is something to ""blood being thicker than water"", but this is something else. How any of the in-laws can live with themselves is beyond me.The book left some questions unanswered for me, and some time sequences seemed off, but, for a true crime lover, it kept me turning pages."
4,While she slept,This book was riviting and just pushed you to see what happens next but in another way it was extremely horrifying. It is really hard to believe but in your heart of hearts you know it is true. I found it a very good and fast read.
2,SAME FACTS,JUST GOES OVER THE SAME FEW FACTS. NOTHING INTERESTING ABOUT HOW THEY LIVED OR HOW THEY CAME TO BE THESE MONSTERS. NOT A VERY GOOD BOOK.
5,Love this brand! Better than OEM!,"Bought this for my 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee... my old mount was original and the rubber failed so I needed a replacement. I've been buying Omix-Ada brand for the past year and it's by far the best quality aftermarket parts for Jeeps. All their parts are very high quality, solid steel, generous powder coating, just as good and likely better than OEM."
2,arrived in bad shape,"The lamp is nice to look at but the shade was creased in the box. It may have been on stock for a long time, hard to say, or it occurred in shipment. Problem is you could not tell it was creased until it was unwrapped (styrofoam and tape everywhere). With this type lamp shade, there is no way to iron out these creases and dents, so it looks like a haggard shade. Now we will have to purchase another new shade and that adds to the expense, which is unfortunate, as well as additional wasted time and effort. Not a good deal. Would not purchase a lamp like this online again. Sorry."
3,nice design poor details,"When open the box, the foam particles are everywhere - the package seems either from ancient ago or just simply poor quality. The bottom and up poles are particularly difficult to install. Inside the top pole there's broken socket and a worn screw, which made me suspect whether I paid full price to receive a returned or used one. The lamp shade is not 100% spotless either, a little smears on it.Overall, I like the design of the lamp, but really don't appreciate the quality."
4,GREAT ARTIST!!! GREAT ORIGINAL SONGS,"I had the pleasure of hearing Bill and his wife in concert last night at the Fairmont Film Society, Fairmont, MN.....Bill not only performed many of the songs on this great CD but others from similar CDs available here.Bill's song ""Hobos in the Roundhouse"" is based on his grandfather's experiences as a railroad roundhouse repairman who made the cold nights a little more comfortable by letting these travelers sleep in the roundhouse rather than outside.The title song of this collection is another Isle original based on true life experiences.You will listen to this CD time and again getting more out of the lyrics each time you hear it."
5,Good quality contoured changing pad cover!,"I have the Simmons contour changing pad, and I am very happy with this cover. It feels thicker than the usual terry cloth cover, is nice and soft, and has held its shape very well through multiple machine washes. The slits on the sides of the cover are perfect for securing the straps of the changing pad. Also, it's a great neutral color to match any decor."
3,Beauty not comfortability...,"This is a beautifull changing pad cover. However it is not soft like the chenille I am used to, and it is ridged so that I would think it was almost not very confortable at all for the baby. I was dissappointed with this product but not enough so to hassle with returning it."
5,Perfect for small kitchens,Affordable! Easy to hang! Perfect for our tiny kitchen! Loveit! Very Strong! It says it just holds pots/pans from hooks but I can fit some of my pot lids on top too!Great! Love it! You should buy one now
5,potrack,"Love it, convient, and pretty. This product helps in a small kitchen with not enough space. It also keeps the lids with the pans which I love,"
5,Great,Good product. Well constructed and looks great. Very nice to have pans at your fingertips and not stacked in a cupboard.
4,Pot Rack,"This item is perfect, it is exactly what I hoped it would be. As described, it is compact and strong. It was surprisingly easy to install."
2,Does not hang far enough from the wall,"I loved the look and length of this, but it just wasn't usable for me. It only sticks out about an inch from the wall. Pans would have to rest against the wall instead of hanging free. I did not want to risk scratching up my new pans. I returned it and got the 32-inch Caphalon rack instead."
5,simple and sweet,"This pot holder is exactly what we needed. It is simple, easy to hang and fits perfectly in our small city kitchen. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,As advertised,"This pot rack is an excellent value for the price. It was exactly as promised and looks very nice. I have 8 Calphalon pans (heavy) hanging from it and it does not bow or bend, which was my concern. We love it and would definitely recommend it."
4,Weber BBQ cover,"This is the cover meant to protect my Weber Silver C BBQ, wind,rain,sleet or snow will not affect its' heavy duty properties."
2,Substitute item sent,If you order this item from THE PRICE PROS you will receive the Weber premium cover #7552 instead. I wanted the weber cover #9936 shown as being available because of the vent screen that has been eliminated on the new cover #7552. I returned the cover to THE PRICE PROS and was told the cover #9936 I had originally ordered was available. I received another one of the wrong covers #7552. Very frustrating. I will return it for a refund and give up on THE PICE PROS.
4,a good place to start,"The obsession with timbre,attack,amplification etc.as opposed to pitch leaves me cold with some contemporary composers but Lachenmann is a special case:i'm often intrigued by the sounworlds he creates inspite of the fact that this isn't quite my kind of thing.There's no doubt about it,Lachennman is 100% sincere about what he does and the architectural sense is exemplary.Also,a glance at any of his scores will reveal just how painstaking this guy is at arriving at these results.At times Lachenmann is akin to the last dessicated remains of western music,the final burning embers.A romantic image for the least romantic of composers and there's something terribly earnest about the spoken element in Musik mit Leonardo.Still,this is obviously the place to start if you've never heard any of his music."
5,One of the best romantic comedies to come out of the UK,"I have seen this film 3 times, and it just gets better with each viewing. Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman give perfect performances in this off-beat romantic comedy that will make you laugh and cry - forget cry...sob!The British just know how to do this genre better than anyone else (i.e. Four Weddings..., Notting Hill, Sliding Doors, etc.): They put enough meat on the bones of their romantic comedies to make you think and feel while being amused and entertained, without tipping the scales (like the French and the Germans tend to do).A perfect, yet highly under-rated film."
4,truly madly deeply through my eyes,"In my opinion, this film was a British attempt at the previous years American blockbuster 'Ghost'. What drew me to it was the intensity of the love between the two main characters and yes it bought tears to my eyes. Best bit: for me was certainly the two singing 'the sun ain't gonna shine anymore'."
2,Great potential evaporates,"I rented this film because I'm a fan of Alan Rickman but little did I know that he wouldn't have such a large part in this movie. I was truly expecting a lot more from this movie, and as I think about it, the beginning was great. I actually found myself emphasizing with the main character, Nina, as in one scene as she poured out her anger at the sudden death of her husband to what I think is her therapist. She is obviously hurt and angry, yet putting on a pleasant mask to cover up at the start. Sometimes she hears his voice. Then in a moving scene, he reappears. If the movie ended there it would be great. Unfortunately, nothing from then on is engaging, honest, or moving. In the end, this movie tries too hard to show us what ""good people"" are like and in the process, fails to reveal anything true about the human soul."
3,"Great movie, but...","I absolutely love this movie and I am a very big fan and admirer of Alan Rickman's work. The only thing that's holding me back from buying this (and giving it a well-deserved 5 stars) is the outrageous price for a new DVD. Nearly $100 with S&H? Sorry, but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for a movie. That's ridiculous."
4,Not For Small Children,"This wand is a lot of fun to play with because it lights up and plays music, just like the show. But if you have a small child in the house keep it out of reach because can be destroyed quickly in the hands of a two year old. For older girls it is great!"
2,It's okay...but,"I bought this for my daughter, after buying the ""Spiral Heart Moon Rod"" by Irwin. It's longer, has hot pink heart with gold crown on top. It contains musical sounds from the Sailor Moon R series, much better then the whirly noises from this one listed. I like the Spiral Heart Moon Rod much more than this one, but it's okay....."
3,Sailor Moon's sceptor,"Well, this really is rather close to the moon sceptor in Sailor Moon R. It lights up, and plays tunes from Sailor Moon's attack. While it looks like you're child could have a bunch of fun running around, attempting to banish monsters back to the negaverse, it will only keep thier attention spans for a few days at the most. It would be good if you had child under 10, or were getting it for a halloween costume, though."
5,"Pain means Hurt, Like To Die For","Hurt is the word that came to mind after first listening session of To Die For. Death is what happens when you turn it on. As you turn up the volume, the death becomes more painful. Brutality style death core killing spree chimpanzee is how it acts to your brain. INTEG IS BEST KING!"
4,I love this Boot!!!,"This boot looks so nice and neat. It opens on the side with a little zipper so you have to put your feet in sideways to get it in. Also, note that the pom pom on the boot falls out very easily. Other than that, it looks great and feels great. It's got a sexy edge to it, yet still quite comfortable."
5,A work of art!,"Out of the Madhouse is a piece of perfection! The plot is absolutely wonderful, original and intriguing. Golden and Holder have outdone themselves! The characterisations are right on spot, especially Spike's in the last bit. Even the new characters introduced were great. This is far better than any of the other Buffy books, even Child of the Hunt. With the new range that the authors are reaching, one really sees the new potential in having a Buffy adult series. This one is definitely a classic! Let's hope the rest of the Trilogy will live up to the first book!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"This was an awsome book! I got completely engrossed in the book and finished it in a day. I loved the way all of the characters were, and I also really really loved the idea of the Gatehouse. It was also really nice how they took their time explaining things, because I've noticed how sometimes the Buffy books can get kinda rushed, because they want to put as much action in as possible. With this book, there was pleanty of action, and enough plot to balance it all out. I also really loved how they brought in characters and made mention of occurences in their other books, Child of the Hunt and Blooded. It really gave you a sense of continuity for all of the books that Golden and Holder have written. I just have to say: JOB WELL DONE!!! I can't wait to read Ghost Roads. After this book, it looks very promising!"
1,BOO BOO BOOO,THIS BOOK WAS TOATALLY LAME WHY DO THEY WRITE BOOKS THAT AREN'T LIKE THE SHOW A SHOW IS MORE BETTER ALL I HALFT TO SAY IF YOUR A BUFFY FAN JUST DON'T READ THE BOOKS!
2,punch! kick! punch!,"One of the things I love most about Buffy as a whole, is character development. This book was so busy with endless action sequences, that the character's personalities were largely ignored.When the book stops for emotional moments it's hard to care, because the character's have all become cardboard cut-out's of themselves.I'll go ahead & read the next one- I'm hoping that Golden & Holder will let up a bit on the constant barrage of battle- it gets tedious after awhile.Proceed with caution."
3,Kindle versions lacking,"While the stories were fairly good reading, I found the Kindle versions of both the first and second books of the Gatekeeper Trilogy poorly presented. The majority of the editing was apparently done using nothing more than a spell-check application, which is ignorant of context; there were few visual indications, such as an extra line break, to indicate a change of scene in the narrative; overall, just too many distractions in the text.My final unfavorable comment concerns the Kindle version of the final book, The Sons of Entropy: there isn't one, thanks so much."
4,The first one I've read without any mistakes.,"I admit I only bought it to pick out mistakes, but I ended up enjoying it. Angel, as usual, was a little out of charecter, but I can live with that. Springheel Jack was cool. I liked him. I only hope that Chris and Nancy can keep Spike in charecter in the next few books, which I am eagerly looking forward to."
2,wish it were better,"I have had 2 of these (the first one I accidently shorted while doing some car work so I got another) both do not read CDs in cold (30 or colder, which is much of the year here in MN. Both had problems reading SD cards after only a few months of use. I really wanted it for that reason. So on a cold morning, I have no Cd and no SD music, and it only wants to read certain tracks for USB drives too. So, when it works, it works fine and sounds great to me (but it must be pointed out, the music ges through my factory Mark VIII amp with 6 speakers, so I give the car the credit). On the second unit, the display also started to look more like Klingon and now shows only a few random lines. So I have to guess at what I want. I wish I could recommend it, but my experience has been they don't last. Spend a few dollars more and get something better."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I purchased this radio as a gift for my brother last Christmas. After he opened it and we went to install it, the protective film was permanently adhered to the radio face and would not come off. I tried contacting VR3 repeatedly regarding this and was only able to leave voicemails with the company. I never got a call back. The radio worked, so my brother just used some goo gone and removed most of it.Less than a year of operation in his truck and the radio is completely dead. We used a complete install kit and bought a factory wiring harness adapter and now the radio doesn't even come on. We have checked all of the fuses and connections and all seem to be in good shape. The radio is just dead, and I'm not even going to bother contacting the company seeing the lack of response I got originally.I would not recommend purchasing a radio from this company. I would spend the extra money and get something that is going to last at least more than a year..."
1,Bad,"I purchased this product and within a week the SD and USB slots would not work. CDs kept getting stuck in the unit and the when these situations occurred the display read error 13. I contacted VR by email about the issue to see it there were any user fixes. There wasn't, so I contacted the seller for a refund."
5,Awesome Value,We have used this radio in the car for several months now and are very impressed with the quality. All of the features that are available on this set usually come on much more expensive models. Everything works extremely well the card reader is very fast and the controls are easy to use. I am very impressed with this radio.
1,Avro Manhattan wrote again a very bad book.,"About ten years ago, a brazilian protestant send this book, to I read this book for some days.It's very bad book, about Vietnam War, american history and Roman Catholicism.The basic idea of this book is that USA went to the Vietnam war, beeing ordered by RCC(Roman Catholic Church).This is a lie.America went to the Vietnam's war, not because of Pope, but because of Cold War politic.America went to Vietnam, for the same reasons that American went to Haiti in 1965, Korea in 1950, etc.JFK was a nominally catholic, but to tell, that the JFK's errors in Vietnam were from RCC is fake.In fact after JFK death in 1963, the number of americans in Vietnam didn't reduced, in fact it was increased.The same happened with the americans deaths in that region at the same time.America went to Vietnam for Cold War's political and military reasons, not economic or religion reasons."
3,The plot has a few weaknesses.,"So the bad guys set a trap for the good guys. But why do they expect the good guys to come that way? This is never explained.After the bad guys are scared away, Pikachu uses his powers to get the victim out of the trap. But why does it take him so long to think of that? This is never explained, either.Moreover, I cannot understand why the book is not better illustrated. Instead of illustrations which relate directly with the story, we are to be satisfied with already existing pictures of Pokemon characters."
5,Great little crib,"Directions are a bit annoying but I am a woman and was able to put the crib together myself so it isn't that hard! The crib is definitely worth the price, small and cute!"
5,Excellent quality,This is a sturdy crib and very much as advertised. It did take my husband quite a while to put together though.
4,great for our space...soft pine wood scratches easily,"We got this crib because of the safety reviews on consumer reports and because we needed a mini crib to fit in our small nursery space. It was a pain to put together as the pictures in the instructions were not exact matches for the parts--so it took some trial and error and deductive reasoning. The headboard had a big gash in it but amazon wasn't able to send us just one part we would have to do that from the manufacturer---so we decided to use it as is as the gash was on the bottom and it wouldn't really show. However we gave it a few more scratches just putting it together. We will see how it holds up once the baby is here. Overall it looks great once it's put together and the size is perfect for us. Obviously the ""mattress"" that comes with it is useless so buy a different one---we chose the colgate mattress eco friendly portable mini size:Colgate Mattress Eco-Friendly Portable Mini Crib Mattress, Ecru"
3,arrived with a substantial dent in the wood bar,"Great crib. Great size. Except after unpacking all the pieces, we noticed there was a substantial dent in one of the round bars. Not wanting to go through the hassle of repacking, repackaging and returning, we kept the crib and fixed the dent. I would assume though that Da Vinci checked the parts before packaging. Perhaps this one escaped the team."
2,not so great,"I saw this crib online months ago but waited to get it because the mattress that goes with it was unavailable until late march. I was so excited to finally receive it, but was disappointed when i began to put it together. To begin with... the instructions are worthless. They are very hard to understand, I had to put them aside and figure it out on my own. Also, the wood had dents and scratches in it already. It is very sturdy once put together, but it's really a MINI crib, very very small. I purchased it because I wanted my baby to sleep in the same room as me and it's a small room already crowded, but this crib is too small. My little girl is only 4 months old and she barely has any room to move around in it. It wont last long, and it's not worth its price. I would have been better off buying a regular crib, and it would have fit in the room just fine. Too small!"
1,worst set up directions I've ever seen,"My husband and I both have Ivy League degrees- granted this doesn't make us 'expert handymen' but at least this prefaces my comments to demonstrate that we are not stupid. The directions to set up this crib were so bad that we had to take it apart and redo steps NUMEROUS TIMES in order to get this crib set up correctly. Not only that, but the product didn't come with all the proper hardware, so between these two issues it took us literally numerous evenings to set this up. Not only that, but the 'wood finish' on this crib scratches off easily and so after just moving it around it looks bad. Honestly my experience with this product was so bad that I am writing my first amazon review just to try to get people to not buy it and to learn from my mistake!"
4,"Scratches easily, but can be polished","The crib is beautiful, but while putting together the parts tend the scratch where the screws meet , so be careful when becoming frustrated putting crib together LoL. Otherwise I would recommend this crib I have the cherry finish and it puts perfectly at the foot of my bed and matches my bedroom furniture exact match ."
5,Bizzang of my buck!!!!,"DIggin' this tiny crib! We ordered it in white, and it's so cute! It looks like a little laundry basket! It's ideal for small spaces!"
5,Very good quality prong collar,"One you get is slightly different because Herm Springer collars prongs start in the middle and run two different directions. The prongs are rounded and its a good heavy weight. Make sure if you are purchasing this for training that you research on how to fit it properly. It needs to be fitted so that it sits right behind the jaw line and that you only need a light tug to correct, not pulling hard to correct. Leerburg has a great video that shows exactly how to fit it."
5,Very good 1st Novel,"Move over Nero and Mrs. O'Leary's cow, the world now has an even worse arsonist to deal with, Roberto Chavera. Roberto is a South American Narco-Terrorist willing to burn the whole city of Los Angeles down in order to free his brother from the United States' legal system. He is opposed by the one man who can stop him, Ethan Bainbridge, an LA cop out for revenge. Roberto, however,is not the only thing Bainbridge must overcome. Crooked cops, interdepartmental rivalries, and incompetent leadership stand in his way while the city burns around them.The novel also contains scenes that could be right from today's newspapers as high rises burn, wind whipped flames surround the city, rioters loot and burn in its heart, and Special Forces extraction teams ""go in country"" to hunt terrorists.A good read, I recommend it."
2,Didnt like,"Didn't like the fragrance of it nor it was long lasting. Wouldn't buy this next time. My rating is purely based on my likes not based on purchase process. The product arrived on-time, in best possible packaging it can come with, best pricing compared to other online and retail and no issues with respect to purchase process."
5,Cinnamon Rolls,"My fiance loves Obsession for Men. I must admit, I love how he smells wearing it - to me, he smells like cinnamon rolls. (and no calories!)"
5,Amazon!,"It is the real thing, you can't really go wrong when the merchandise is shipped and sold by Amazon! Smell like Obsession by Calvin Klein and allot cheaper than the department store!"
1,NOT REAL SCENT,"Received this item in a sealed box with cellophane wrapping, however this IS NOT the real Obsession for Men scent. It really smells nothing like it!! I kept waiting to see if the scent would change once it has been worn for a while, but it does not. This is a total rip-off and of course you cannot return it."
3,"Good for what it is (elderly gentleman/churchy scent), but I'm not a fan.","I bought the genuine product in person at a major store. 0.5 oz quite cheap just to test it out and see what all the fuss is about. I ended up returning it after one spray, one day.It's very good for what it is and I immediately recognized the famous scent -- that of an elderly gentleman, and very reminiscent of a church environment. I assure you this is absolutely not something you want to wear if you're young; just smelling it instantly brought back memories of older men in my life. I can not imagine any young man pulling this off, especially dressed in casual clothing.This is a very loud and proud scent; the staying power and sillage aren't just good, they're excellent. Everyone will know you're wearing it, so be sure that's what you want."
2,Not great but smells SANDAL Wood,Not a great perfume and not worth for this price. Smells sandal thatz it. this note is worth for $ 15 or so.Try this before you buy.
3,Seemed good and different at 1st but it got old...,"I still haven't received any compliments on it. I use armani, polo green, polo blue, drakkar, and ck1 in addition to this cologne. This one was my favorite when I started using it but since it has dropped to my least favorite and I'm adjusting my rating."
1,Thought this would be REAL Calvin Klein,"Disappointed in Amazon (brand). This makes me very weary of my Amazon ""Prime Membership"" account. If this is the type of product that Amazon is purportedly ""sponsoring"" in their name then I might change my premium video membership back to Netflix once the Amazon Prime runs out.I thought that by looking at the auction and no mention that this was an ""imposter"" that it would be the REAL Calvin Klein Obsession cologne. The packaging was minimal, the bottle/cap is substandard to all other Obsession colognes I have purchased in the past (a LOT). In addition, it smells like a cheap alcohol ridden slightly ""headachey"" fragrance. It is definitely NOT the real Calvin Klein - Obsession cologne."
1,cologne is different,"Be careful, this cologne is a different color and does not smell like the real bottle from the dept store is it the same? it said Eau De Toilette spray vaporizer on the bottle."
1,Dislike the scent,"It is a very powerful scent, in fact it is overpowering. Of all 50 different colognes I tried, this is the strongest. If you were to spray 20 different colognes on 20 index cards, and shuffle the deck, in 20 minutes, all of the cards would smell like Obsession. It would be a good scent if it were less strong.This scent is very masculine, but it's not unique. It is very similar to the scents of other colognes.You may find women that absolutely love this, but on the same note, you will probably find a lot of women who are absolutely disgusted with this scent. This is not a play it safe, please everybody cologne. Wear it for your girlfriend if she likes it, but otherwise you may end up spending money on this and it not helping you at all attract women, but the opposite effect.This review is clearly subjective, and there are plenty of people who will enjoy this cologne. I would just recommend that you try it before you buy it."
2,Not so great for this price,I bought this with high hopes. I did not like it much. You can get a better one than this.
4,Obsession,I had previously purchased this product but I was disappointed that the bottle was so small. I expected a larger product.
5,Obsession for my son...,This was a gift for my son. He's used Obsession for years & it smells great on him. What more can I say. I love it.
4,Nice Perfume,"I am using Obsession from almost 1 year, this perfume is good in all seasons and for all ocasions.The one i got in amazon is a lot cheaper than the departmental store price. I definitely recommend this product and buying this at amazon."
1,Is this original by Calvin Klein or Not,This Obsession received doesn't smell same to the original Obsession made by the company. Is this a watered version???? product.
5,Love the price,Awesome Cologne my husband loves it. Don't need a whole lot and it last all day. Highly recommended it. Great for the price.
5,My Obsession,"I have used Obsession for many,many years. Has always been my favorite. I use only a quick spray and I've received many compliments"
1,bad knockoff,This was a poor imitation both in scent and product packaging. The cap was cracked and the push button dispenser were of a poor quality. Reading other reviews I see more people victimized on this non returnable product.
5,The Cut,Ain't Mad at cha is still a slamming cut.2Pac really put something down on this track.you feel the depth&vibe all through out this song.The Man could really write period.he said so much in so many ways.
1,Unfair Pricing!,"Yes we as Fendi lovers know that it has been discountinued. BUT~ and this is a BIG BUT~ This pricing is CRAZY! I am sure their are people out there that will pay this price as they get caught up in the whole "" out of stock"" frenzi~ But come on.. We all know it has been discountinued from the High End stores for a while. I was buying it at Burlington Coat Factory for $19.99 until just recently when stock started running out. This gift pack only sold for 29.99!!!!Play fair People....... You will get more sales if you have fair prices. I have been in retail for 40 years and know if you keep your prices low and fair you will get MORE BUYERS!I love this perfume. It is my signature as well. But $360.00!! LOL Good luck with that....."
1,Missing two of the most important projects,"Two of the most important projects are not introduced in this book except in the ""Other Project"" chapter where the information you can get from Jakarta Commons website is better and clearer.The two projects are:Validator - a must for almost every Java developer. Who doesn't do validations? This project provides useful validations such as email address and credit card numbers. More importantly, it allows us to define validation rules in XML format.Digester - also a must for anyone who needs to parse XML configuration files or rule files. Very handy. No need to use SAX directly anymore.I also found that other projects that enjoy a chapter in the book are not explained better than from Jakarta Commons Website. For example, the Lang project. I learned more from the Jakarta Commons website in an hour than from the book.To summarise, this book is really disappointing and not worth the money."
4,"A useful and, let's face it, cute book.","Willhoite's illustrations have always had the cartoony appeal of Kevin Henkes and that helps to make them more calming and sweet. This book is more a pleasant fantasy of how things should be and might be in the future than it is a realistic depiction of present day gay America.This well done book is a must for men or women contemplating same-sex marriages who also have young children. It is the story of a divoriced man who is re-marrying. He just happens to be marrying another man. It is presentd in such a way that it doesn't feel like anything too out of the ordinary for most of the people involved.It doesn't quite live up to the simple, realistic Daddy's Roommate...but it is an excellent and necessary book!"
1,NO NO NO!!!,Bad metal - bad design --- at least as far a the scissors went. I closed it and it broke the deployment catch of the sissors. Plus all this black stuff comes off on you hands AND THE QUALITYS JUST NOT THERE!!!
2,great tool,"ordered two for my son's that are away at college and in the military, both should have been in same package but only received one, amazon customer service was great and very helpful with refund and they made effort to get me one but it did not arrive in time. so the fact is I was unable to give it to my son for our family Christmas party. I'm sure an oversight in the packaging dept. but where is quality control? very dissapointed."
5,"Love it, finally got my first Leatherman, not disappointed.","I've always wanted the Leatherman Wave when I first saw it years ago when it first released. Finally bought one and I love it. It has a nice selection of tools and the build quality is top notch as always. Very glad I bought the black oxide finish, it's very badass and is nice. Some people have voiced concerns about the finish scratching up and rubbing off. This seems normal, took a shop rag and dipped it in water, gave it a nice thorough rub down and it doesn't seem to rub off on my hands when I handle it. As far as the scratching up...well it's a tool. Some scratches and general wear and tear are to be expected.Buy it, admire it, love it."
2,Philips screwdriver is poor quality,"Accessible blades without opening is nice option. However the philips screwdriver attachment is not a standard size #2 head as it is on other models such as the Blast. I have been carrying a leatherman for almost 20 years, it has become a ""third hand"" so to speak, I use it everyday. The screwdriver(s) are by far the most used tool and I do not see this one lasting very long.As this was a gift I will most likely keep it and toss it in the glove box for emergencies. If you use a Leatherman as a primary tool this is not the one, try the Blast."
3,Buy the Stainless better if you do not NEED Black,"I bought this black Oxide Finish because I loved my stainless so much and I wanted to get a Molle Sheath. However the Oxide if very dirty. Almost like the leatherman was used. I read other review saying the same, so I decided to rub it down with a used dryer sheet. See customer pic to see how much grime came off the unit. Much stiffer (may be a bad thing) due to the oxide finish. Scissors did not function the same may need worn in. Saw blade seems a little bent and does not fold into the handle without catching on metal lip. Stainless does NOT have any of these issues. I assume it is the extra thickness with the coating. If you do not clean first you hands will be black."
4,My review,"Great product! Only shortcoming is the finish on the item. It should be more professionally done; however, it doesn't detract from the tools utility."
4,Exactly what he wanted!,I couldn't believe how fast the item arrived and it was the perfect gift. It was exactly what he wanted.
2,stiffness,"This leather-man has a durable construction, however most of the tools are too stiff to pull out without the air of a stick or something. This makes most of the tools useless if you lack a pen to dig in there and pull the tool our with."
1,Sucks,This product first of all took two months to get to me so it should not take any thing in the world two months going in any direction to get to anybody. After waiting so long I open the product up and it had scratches on it and was not in plastice just in an leatherman box so I'm guessing somebody use it before it got to me because it has dirt on it and scratches all around it. I dont know about some people but when I buy something that says new I like to get what I paid for
2,Good Product / Shady Seller,"Leatherman makes a fine product, but the particular one I received was definitely a used/refurb item. There are minor scratches on the handle and a weird dirty grease on the action. Not cool."
2,Hmm.,"Definitely not up to par with my original model SuperTool. Blade dulls quickly, open up is stiff still and I've been using regularly for a month. The black oxide coat appeared scratched, as if it had been used previously and sold as new, and came all scratched up (and dull) out of the box. But I'll keep them for the pliers."
5,Great tool.,"Only one complaint so far and that is the case. It fits the tool and the 40 piece bit set but when you take one or the other out, the remaining get loose. I think each piece should have its own compartment without having the pay ungodly prices for a custom sheath to be made."
5,Leatherman Wave Black Oxide Finish Multi Tool,"The tools are rather stiff but effective. I use a label to mark the location of my scissors and blade. Left-handers be advised that the two outer blades--which feature a lock/unlock near the pivot point base--are designed for single right hand use. You will probably use digits from both hands if you are left-handed. Another cool thing about its outer blades is that you may not always need to fully unlock it. Some material requires a 30deg unlock and ""pruning"" your cut. WATCH YOUR FINGERS!The sheath is okay for some other application like a mini flashlight. It kind of gets in the way and not easy to resheathe. I replaced the MOLLE sheath with ""Leatherman 934810 Leatherman Wave Nylon Sheath""Leatherman 934810 Leatherman Wave Nylon Sheath"
3,Black finish is a major dissapointment,"I read the reviews about how bad the black finish was. Seeing as how Leatherman is such a well respected company and their tools are second to none, I decided to order it anyway. Boy was I dissapointed. I thought all the negative reviews were exaggerated by cry babies, as many reviewers seem to be. This time, I was wrong.The finish rubs off and scratches off pretty easily. I could get over that fact alone, but it just looks so bad. Brand new it looks like its been used for years. The tool itself is very good and the locks are great. If it wasn't for that I'd give it 1 star. The sheath is also great quality. I have to say I'm pretty dissapointed by Leatherman.If I had to do it all over again I would have gotten the stainless steel Wave. Save some money and get the nicer looking tool."
3,"Great, but with flaws","This is an upgrade, and the second time I have reviewed this Leatherman. It is a great product with all the tools I need for my lifestyle. It is, however, REALLY REALLY tight. It is so tight it becomes almost impossible to close. I wrote the manufacturer twice and have never received a reply; which really flies in the face of this company's reputation. I still recommend it but if you have a problem you are in your own."
5,PERFECT,The Leatherman Wave is the perfect tool to have handy for just about anything. I got this model because I wanted it to be a little classier. The black is durable and does wear off easily at all. I would highly recommend getting the bit set.
2,Durability = ???,"I bought this tool while in Baghdad, Iraq in 2006. Matte Black was all the rage, as no one wanted a glinting, silver, non-camo tool shining in the sun! And I did not have a problem with the matte black finish rubbing off like others have reported. HOWEVER...Just last weekend, safe back in the USA, I used the pliers to twist a metal band slightly and they snapped cleanly in half. I am terribly disappointed at the lack of durability, and glad I never had to ""trust my life,"" to the thing in a survival situation. Leatherman must do better than this!!!"
1,Not at all what i thought,"I guess from the pictures i was thinking this was going to be easy... it wasnt. You have to mix everything in a blender first (yogurt, whole milk, sometimes heavy cream, sugar, etc etc etc etc) and get it PERFECT, dump it into the bucket and set your timer for 18-20 minutes EXACTLY (recipe depending). Any less and its to runny, any more and its to hard and it wont dispense. What i thought would be a fun, easy thing to do as a family turned into a huge messy hassle.Not at all what i thought it would be, and am very disappointed, as i love soft serve (and all ice cream in general), and was really looking forward to this product."
1,It ain't all of that !,"I have never done this before on an item, but thought it might save someone the trouble of trying the item and being disapointed. I spent over $35 on materials and tried many times to make the different reciepts, in every case I only produced milk shakes. I even tried using three different home freezers to make sure the bowl was getting cold enough. I bought it for my 86 year old mother for one of her Christmas gifts, shame on me. Happy holidays and I would suggest that the company that makes this item think more of their name before they release an item like this."
2,Does not work as advertised.,Does not live up to the quissinart name. We gave it a second try and worked a little better. Disappointing. I was going to return but ran out of time.
2,Don't buy this,"I bought this item as a gift, but was very disappointed. It says ice-cream in 20 minutes, but it takes at least 12 hrs to freeze the bowl(2 days later & it's still not frozen enough). You'd be better off sticking cream & sugar in a bowl in the freezer and stirring it once in a while. Not worth $20, let alone $80."
1,Piece of junk,Besides getting screwed on shipping. This unit is a $100 piece of junk. does not freeze Ice cream like it should. Does not despense Ice cream like it should. Should contact the BBB on this item its bad!
2,does not work for us,"All the parts are plastic, so be careful handling it. The ""mix-in"" release hole is very tiny, not even m&ms or chocolate chips fit through it, so you are limited in choices. Ours makes more of milk-shakes, rather than soft-serve. It NEVER worked by pulling down the handle to come out from the bottom hole, so we always have to scoop it out. That's not that much of a problem except it isn't as pretty a presentation as if it worked correctly. As well, it never makes the ice-cream thick enough--always more like a shake, like I said. And you can not save and freeze the remainder, as it turns icy in the freezer. We have followed the directions diligently four times in 2 months and tried different recipes, and always have the same poor results. I will give it away to the thrift store as soon as the kids get over the novelty of making ice-cream at home. I really wished it worked properly."
1,Verry disappointed,I was very disappointed with this machine. I tried it on several separate occasions. I could not get a soft serve texture. I even placed the ice cream mixture in the freezer for 20 minutes before attempting to make the ice cream. I let it mix for 30 minutes before calling it quits. It also takes a lot of room in the freezer and I found that the unit was too tall to fit between the counter and the cabinets.
3,"So far, so good. Need a better recipe though.","We used the simple vanilla recipe that came with the maker. It froze well and dispensed from the machine fine, until it got too thick. However, the texture of the ice cream was odd. It was kind of fluffy and left a fatty coating on the roof of our mouths. It reminded me of frozen whipped cream. I need to find a lower fat recipe or try or make a custard style. The only drawback is that the ice cream went from just the right thickness to dispense to way too thick in a matter of minutes. You have to be quick if you're going to dispense more than a couple of cones full."
4,"Good product, but takes longer than expected",Takes longer to make than stated. I put the mix in the freezer for about 1 1/2 hours before making to speed up the process. I have made the vanilla ice cream and added 1/2 package of jello for flavoring.
1,Sorry product,"I purchased the Cuisinart soft-serve ice cream maker for my daughter's birthday. She has other Cuisinart products and HAD thought highly of the manufactor. We followed the instructions, but only received very liquid results. What a disappointment, waste of effort, time and money."
2,love Cuisinart but not this model,It makes good ice cream but won't dispense unless the ice cream is just the right consistency. Too thick and you have to scoop. We never could get the sprinkles dispenser to work. After making 3 batches of ice cream we only got about 3 or 4 cones and had to scoop the rest. I took it back and got the 2 qt Cuisinart from Sams for $59. My daughter bought the 1 1/2 qt ICE-20 model for $49 and loves it. They all make great ice cream but why pay more for bells and whistles that don't work very well.
1,really soft,"I was excited to make ice cream cones for my grandchildren. I was so disappointed. I need the low fat one so I made the simple vanilla lower fat version. It tasted good, but was soupy. I put the remainder in the freezer, but the whole cool thing was to make the swirl cones for the kids and the machine let me down. Is it the recipes in the book that comes with the maker that fail or the machine? I would appreciate any help anyone has to offer."
5,Delicious,We bought this ice cream maker for our son-in-law. He made us ice cream and it was delicious!!!!
3,Ok,"I bought this for the family to make ice cream. Its a good purchase, since it is very affordable to make ice cream - beats buying at the store. The machine is easy to work - the ice cream takes a while to get hard, and its a pain to take apart and clean. I don't own any other ice cream makers for comparison, so......"
3,"I like this but, it doesn't dispense well.","I love the Cuisinart icecream maker but, if I had it to do over again, I would buy the smaller one that doesn't dispense. The only reason I bought this one was because the idea of being able to dispense soft serve and ""mix-ins"" sounded awesome but, it doesn't dispense well. It seems to rely on gravity. I bought my daughter the smaller one that doesn't dispense and I like it so much better."
1,It's less trouble driving to carvels,"The machine leaked after we poured in the liquid ingredients.The mix in dispenser did not operate properly, all we put in were sprinkles. The ice cream did not harden enough until about 25 minutes;kids cannot wait that long.We could of driven to the local ice cream store and back by this time. Save your money,buy a old fashion ice cream maker instead at least your kids will get a workout and be occupied at the same time."
1,Cusinart Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker 1 1/2 quart,There is not even a rating for this item. The least amount it would let me use was a one star and it does not deserve this. Do not waste your time or money on this item. It does not make ice cream. We followed the directions explicitly. The mix is not even cool after 30 - 45 minutes. We had to finally stop the machine and put the mix in the freezer to finish freezing it. We purchased it and brought it to Mexico and now can not return the item to the US for a refund.
2,Disappointed,"I liked the ease of cleaning this machine, ability to add sprinkles, chips, etc. while dispensing, and the uncomplicated procedure for making the ice cream. However, I have a lot of faith in Cuisinart products. But I was very disappointed with this machine. I tried on 4 separate occasions, rereading the directions each time in case I missed something. I could not get a soft serve texture. I even put the ice cream bowls in the freezer to prevent the ""ice cream"" from melting further when it hit the bowl. It did not measure up to other Cuisinart products."
4,Cuisinart Mit-it-in Soft Serve maker,"This machine works fairly well, provided that you make absolutely sure the canister is frozen solid, AND that you don't go over the 1.5qt limit. Is it like a soft-serve machine at a snack bar? No. But, for the house, it works fine. It is probably a little over-priced though. Otherwise, we like it."
3,"Save your money, drive to DQ","I was so excited to buy this to make homemade treats for the kids. Like others said, it's a pain having to freeze the container and it's only good for making one batch. If you insist on buying it, you might want to buy a spare container (about $40).You won't have soft-serve like at Dairy Queen unless you are good at tweaking recipes. My first attempt was a disaster but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. It's something you'll definitely need to practice. I've had to wait over 20 minutes each time I've made it. I think putting the ingredients in the freezer for about 20 minutes before making the icecream helps to speed it along.If I could do it over again, I'd save my money, it's not worth the hassle."
1,Do not buy,"Do not buy this. If you are looking for the thrill of a real Soft Serve maker, then learn from my mistakes. I have owned many ice cream makers and this is by far the worst. Topping dispensers are terrible, my soft serve handle broke after 2 uses."
5,Loving it!,This makes the best soft serve ice cream or just regular ice cream if you let it run a little longer. I use this machine about 1-2 times a week. My family loves ice cream and this machine is a good way to make your own healthy versions. The price is awesome on it too.
5,V.good,"Cuisinart ice 45 It's v.good machine, &#1570;&#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1605;&#1578;&#1575;&#1585;&#1577; &#1578;&#1587;&#1578;&#1581;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1575;&#1569;I advance to by it. . . . . ."
3,Soft serve I cream maker,"Ice cream freezes nicely but the dispenser is hard to use, comes out in little spurts. Nevertheless it fascinates the grand kids and homemade ice cream or frozen yogurt is a good treat."
2,"Works, but not worth it","The product works, however I can achieve soft ice cream with my regular (and much smaller) ice cream maker. This product takes up a huge amount of space. The topping dispenser is gimmicky and works only with very tiny ingredients. Though you won't be able to achieve the nice swirl of the dispensed soft serve, a standard ice cream maker would be a far better useful tool. This product is for mere show - it looks cool and the kids love watching the ice cream come out. But that's a small pro compared to all the cons - big size, high price, amount of parts that have to be cleaned after every use, poor quality topping dispenser."
1,not worth price,this product worked once then leaked from seal all over not woth the price not happy.. Woill not ever buy this product again
3,Soft serve ice cream maker,"This is a cool looking product, instills excitement. Probably great for kids, although I think even a kid would be disapointed when the ice cream is being dispensed into a ice cream cone. It is so slow, it would be melted before you have the cone full. Its a cool looking gadget, but if you want to make ice cream, I would just get a regular ice cream maker and scoop it out. I ended up just letting this dispense into a bowl, and sticking it in the freezer. It did make ice cream and I guess thats all it really does advertise, the appearance is very deceiving!"
4,Family Fun Nite,This ice cream maker is easy to use and clean. My family enjoyed making the ice cream and deciding what toppings they wanted on their own sundae. Used the simple vanilla recipe and it turned out great. Lots of ice cream left over to freeze. Would recommend to all ice cream lovers. Gave it 4 stars because toppings sometimes get stuck in chute.
1,Does not work,Buy a regular ice cream maker. This is not going to give you soft-serve ice cream like you get at McDonald's. What you get is too soupy to be called ice cream or too much like regular ice cream so that it won't flow through the unit.
2,Soft Serve Ice Cream - Good; Sprinkle device from Hades,"Our kids asked for the soft serve ice cream maker for Christmas. I did make really delicious soft serve ice cream. However, the sprinkle device did not work as planned - dumping the contents of sprinkles on the floor! Given that my wife had recently done a thorough cleaning of the kitchen, she was not a happy camper. We spend an hour cleaning it up, and we are still finding the sprinkles!"
2,"Hope you have a big, VERY COLD freezer","I was under the impression that this was fully automatic, meaning you didn't need to find a huge spot in an already over crowded freezer to pre-freeze the bowl. Also, the freezer needs to be zero degrees. The average refrigerator freezer is NOT zero degrees. I opened this and expected to have ice cream in 20 minutes, not 13 hours later. I am disappointed. It is expensive, especially when the Tastee Freeze down the street has cones for 99 cents! I am going to pack it up and give it as a gift rather than buy a new deep freezer to accomodate the bowl."
2,Be Creative,"I read the reviews, and yes, you get what you pay for. This is a great price, but you must make your own recipes. The simple chocolate recipe is horrible, waaay to much cream (causes tummy ache). So if you have the time to 'experiment' in the kitchen, it is a cool product. My advice: freeze the bowl like everyone says but also, you MUST refrigerate your mix as well before you pour it in. Also, there is only a short window from when your ice cream dispenses properly 30-40mins, then it's hard, then it starts to melt! Overall, I'd rather pay Mr. Softee $2."
2,Not what I expected...,"The mixing bowl must be completely frozen solid for over 12 hours before this machine will work properly. So I hope you have a large, below 0 degrees Fahrenheit freezer to place it in. Once you start mixing the ice cream, its best if you mix the ingredients first, and then pour the mixture into the bowl. It does freeze in about 20 minutes, but by the time it is thick enough to stay in the cone, it is almost too thick to dispense, and the ice cream comes out around the top of the mix-in dispenser tray. The mix-in option is pretty worthless too, just sprinkle them on yourself, or you'll get a lot in the bottom of your cone and none in the middle and a little on the top."
3,ICE-45 Soft icecream maker,"This product works as advertised - but it is extremely important to place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer to insure that it freezes solid. The first two times using this product we failed to make ice cream because we froze the bowl in the front part of our freezer for 24 hours and it did not freeze solid. The condiment dispenser works fine for sprinkles, but items like chopped nuts don't quite work as well. The recipies are very good and once you get the feezer bowl froze solid (really takes about 48 hours the first time) the ice cream is very very good."
4,"Worth the Money, Just for the Fun!","I purchased the Mix It In on 9/8/06 and used it the next day. I never got soft serve. I froze the bowl again, this time in my upright freezer, and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours.Today, I made soft serve!!!!!! It isn't perfect but I'm well on my way. I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent. To make this machine work for you here are some pointers:1. If you don't have an upright or chest freezer, put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer.2. Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours.3. You can forget the 12-15 minute check described in the manual. You will not have a chance of having soft serv before a minimum of 25 minutes. I mixed as long as 40 minutes.4. SAVE YOUR RECEIPT. Since the ice cream takes twice as long to mix as is suggested in the manual, you are using the motor 2x as much. Therefore, you might have to use the 3 year warranty."
1,Great for making your favorite chilled soup,"The concept for this machine is great...too bad it doesn't work! After deep freezing the bowl in a professional grade freezer, we proceeded to follow the directions for the vanilla ice cream. After 12 minutes, still a soupy consistency, after 20 minutes, the same. We let it run for 50 minutes before throwing in the towel. The ingredients are currently in the freezer, freezing in a metal mixing bowl. I hope I will be able to return this product. What a waste of time and money!"
1,Ugh!,"Short and sweet: It won't freeze your ice cream and it is a major pain to clean.I've tried freezing the bowl in my regular freezer (0 degrees) and my deep freeze (-6 degrees) for several days at a time before use. It doesn't matter. ""Milkshake"" was the closest to ice cream I achieved.There is a small hole at the base of the bowl for dispensing and the mixing blades have a spiral around the middle that, when the machine is turned on and the base open, will supposedly dispense your ice cream. Of course, all I got was slush, but moving past that, trying to get all of the ice cream out of all of those crevices was very difficult. The hardest part to clean was the piece with the handle you pull to start dispensing. It's virtually impossible to clean everything out of the mechanism.I wish I had paid more attention to, not only the reviews, but the proportion of those reviews. When you have half as many 1 star reviews as 5 star reviews, there is a big problem."
4,After all I liked,"I really don't know if summer here in Brazil is much more hotter then summer in US.The bowl does not keep the icecream firm enough to have a consistent serving.Only the few serving, when the bowl is almost empty look better.I tried 20, 25,30 minutes with no changes.After 35 minutes the icecream starts to thaw very fast"
4,Easy to make,"I received this as a Christmas present and have made ice cream at least a dozen times since. The only time it didn't turn out was when I only froze the bowl for 7 hours instead of all day or overnight. We just have a normal freezer and it freezes just fine in there.We usually make the simple vanilla or simple chocolate recipes which are as the name says, simple. Takes about 5 minutes to make the batter and then about 16 minutes to freeze. We only make a 1/2 batch, so I don't know if it would take longer with a larger batch.One trick we learned with the mix-ins is to chill them first. We put the sprinkles and mini chocolate chips in the freezer while the ice cream was being made. They dispensed easily, nothing got stuck, and cleanup of the dispensers was easy. Many parts are dishwasher safe, but cleanup is more involved than our traditional ice cream maker."
4,Ice -45,"We thought this a great gift for our grandchildren. It was! The only thing said. 1. is it takes up space. 2. It has to be cleaned. This was not hard, I would have had the kids do it but our daughter has to do it all. As a guift it worked better than we thought."
1,"Not worth the money, below expectations!!","Would not recommend this product to anyone. The flow of the ice cream is not heavy enough to make a pretty cone or cup, no matter how longer you allow it to freeze. The consistency is still not thick enough. If the opening were larger I feel it would be better. Very disappointing... Don't waste your money!"
1,False advertising,"The outside of the box states: ""Perfect consistency. Cuisinart ice-cream making technology ensures the right consistency.""The directions then read, ""if your bowl is too warm ice cream may not freeze properly"" or even better ""if machine stops dispensing, simply open the top and scoop out by hand.""Umm, how does scooping out by hand equal a ""Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker with perfect Consistency""?A huge disappointment. I feel this is simply a repackaging of their disappointing ""freezer bowl"" technology. Most people can't get the bowl cold enough and those that can end up with an icy, inferior product.Save your money."
1,Disappointing,"Knowing it was a Cusinart, I expected really good things. We were disappointed. We tried it twice, strictly adhering to directions, and it didn't really work either time. Had to return it. My son thinks that all the extra features made it less functional, i.e., the condiment holders/dispensers."
2,Not what it appears to be...,"I just bought this machine and was sooo excited to get it. A soft icecream dispenser... not!!! Even if you start dispensing right when it is ready... you would be lucky to get 3 cones out before it is too hard to dispense. The goodies slide down the ramp, but make a bit of a mess. It makes the icecream fine, but there isn't much of it there. Since you have to scoup the icecream out anyway, I would just get a larger ice cream freezer, and probably at a fraction of the price. Also, the 2 recipes I have used from their book have been less than desirable. Maybe I am so extremely dissapointed because I was sooo excited to get it... hard to say.Does anyone else have this problem... if not, how do you get more to dispense??? I would love to know...please leave a comment..."
4,ice cream maker,So far I am really enjoying this product. It is so simple to use. Pour the ingredients in and let it run for 20 or so minutes. Clean-up is also very simple. It is easy to assemble and take apart. I am very happy about this purchase.
4,Soft Serve Mixer,We like it fine we never used any of the resipes that came with it because we get a soft serve mix form our milk man. I take about 45min to make and we put the rest in the freezer but it cheeper then buying ice creem.
5,Ice Cream,"The machine is great. I am giving this ice maker as a present to my sister in Costa Rica, she loved to make her own ice cream.She will enjoy it very very much.When she receives it then I will be able to tell you about the ice cream!!!!!!Thank you for the great service."
1,ice cream maker,Do not waste your money on this ridiculous item!!! I bought this for my daughter as a birthday present. I took it out tonight to use for the third time and it was already broken. the mixer hook did not turn and kept on making a clicking noise. The stupidest part was when it didn't work i had to take out the bowl to spill out the contents but it has a hole in the bottom so everything goes everywhere!!! It makes a huge mess when you use it even when it was working. OMG!! Never had i had such a bad experience with an appliance like i had with this one!
3,"""It's a lot of fun to use""","Anyone else notice how many times she says ""It's a lot of fun to use"" in that video?? It's not THAT fun, lady."
2,Ice Cream Maker,After reviewing what everybody else has written I have learnedthat you have to keep this freezer bowl in the back of yourfreezer just to make ice cream. I can make some flavor andput that in my freezer and make some ice cream without buyingthis machine on my own. I want a self contained ice creammaker that can make a product by plugging it in the wallwithout a freezer in sight. So I guess this product isnot for me.
5,Great product and service,We went on a cruise recently and loved having the Soft Serve Ice Cream. When we got home we decided to purchase one for ourselves. We are happy with the Cuisinart Ice Cream maker.
4,Cuisinart Ice-45 Mix-It-In Soft-Serve 1 1/2 Quart Ice-Cream Maker,"We have actually only used it once. The product did produce pretty good ice cream, but we used cheap Food Lion brands of Yogurt, so need to redo it. As far as the ease of using it, it went pretty well. There are alot of parts to it, which I guess I did not expect. It was a bit bigger than expected too. The ice cream comes down at a bit of a weird angle when you pull down the lever, it sloshes ice cream here and there. I know now to not let any ice cream dry on the corkscrew mixer part, it's really hard to clean all the dried ice cream off. I am the dishwasher, so I guess most people have electric dishwasher's these days. Overall, I really do like the product though, although ours had to be mixed for double the time recommended to come out not so runny. I don't like the part that the bucket has to stay in the freezer for 12 hours before use, that may have changed my mind on buying it."
2,"Novelty only, not efficient or easy to use",Difficult to use. Not fun for kids. Add-in feature does not work well. My children didn't enjoy this at all. They also did not like the taste and texture of the ice cream (used vanilla recipe only so far). Ice cream is too light and fluffy.
3,A little disappointing,"My husband and I just tried out this machine and, like the other reviewers, it took much longer for the ice cream to freeze to a good consistency. One problem we had was that the ice cream came out the spout VERY slowly and sometimes in chunks. Does anyone know how to get it to move faster? It's almost as if there is a small window of opportunity for the perfect consistency so that it flows in one stream. The ice cream was delicious and we appreciate the ability to make our ice cream with organic products and the ingredients of our choosing."
2,Looks don't always count,"This unit looks like it would be fun for the kids, but in fact, it barely works. Even when the insert is pre-frozen in a zero degree freezer, the maching has problems getting the mix even into a ""soft"" state, and even when it gets close to that, the ice cream does not dispense in a manner that allows for the classic soft-serve look in the cone. An email to cuisinart regarding the problem went unanswered. We used it twice, and gave up. One hint that's not in the instructions: you have to keep the machine running while dispensing -- or trying to dispense -- the ice cream. Another hint that's not in the instructions: don't buy this item."
2,Like it? Not so much,"REally runny ice cream, even after you freeze the bowl for a week in the upright freezer. We have to put the mix in the fridge for 2 hours, then pour it through about five times before it gets cold enough to retain the mix in the bowl. Ridiculous. And after it does freeze, it's impossible to dispense. Bought this for my 9-year old for her birthday and I'm about to return it. Buy a regular ice cream maker instead of this soft-serve thing."
4,Cuisinart Ice-45 Ice Cream Maker,"Have used this now on three occasions and have been very pleased with the results in peach, strawberry and chocolate ice creams. It can be a little tricky getting the serving done with the exact consistency you're looking for, but that's a personal preference. The longer it runs, the thicker it gets, of course. Just follow the directions (prefreezing the container is an obvious must) and recipes (including more on line) and it's pretty easy to impress the kids or guests."
2,Does not freeze,"I agree with the other reviewers that this product never freezes the ice cream beyond a soup consistency. We received this as a gift, and although we already had the Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet maker (which we LOVE), we decided not to return this one and give it a try. What a mistake. I've tried this (and failed) three times. I'm currently working on a batch of Root Beer Float Sherbet that's been churning for 25+ minutes, and we're going to end up drinking it out of straws. I've had complete success with the other ice cream maker, so I don't think it's lack of understanding the instructions on my part. Definitely think hard before investing in this one!"
4,Fabulous sorbets!,"Bought this at a kitchen store for a lot more money- should have checked here first! My initial attempt was a lemon-berry sorbet, modifying a recipe I found on the internet. It turned out wonderfully, though it doesn't make much. As recommended, I had my ingredients very cold (used frozen berries in a blender with simple syrup, then strained), and it took about 15 minutes. Getting ready for the chocolate ice cream in the recipe book now. I only gave this 4 stars because the possibilities haven't been fully explored yet!"
2,There's a better product,"I bought the ICE-45 and Amazon shipping was prompt. The product is okay but not great. Soft-serve was either too runny or too thick. Many parts to wash so clean up is time consuming. Sent it back to Amazon. Returns are easy and swift-thanks Amazon. Purchased the Cuisinart ICE-21 locally and it is great. It is an ice cream maker that is very simple to use and clean. You can make soft serve but you have to spoon it out of the 1 1/2 qt. freezer tub. No problem since you had to do much the same with the ICE-45 cuz the dispenser was difficult to get a good pour anyway. The ICE-21 is also about $25.00 cheaper than the ICE-21, another plus."
3,Generally works well...some issues,Positives:1. Relatively inexpensive2. Easy to clean3. Simple to use4. Good thermal propertiesNegatives:1. You need to watch the machine to dispense at the right viscosity. Too soon and the cone will pretty much fall over. Too long and the viscosity is too high and themachine will freeze up.2. When you leave the machine too long it will stall out. The ice cream becomes solid and the motor stalls; the motor will overheat and a thermal breaker will flip. The machine has to cool inorder to work again. There is nothing in the manual about this.3. The height of the machine is too low...you can't really dispense a large cone.4. Dispensing is somewhat erratic.
2,bummed...,After reading all the reviews I thought well some people get it right...I should be able too. I have only had one batch of 12 turn out. I have tried multiple receipes as well. Even the same one that worked the first time didn't the second. It does taste great and I just freeze the runny stuff and it taste great as ice cream....but that is not what I was hoping for.
4,Easy to Use,"The ice cream maker is easy to use and the ice cream is very tasty. However one time it would be perfect and the other not so much, in consistency. I think a lot has to do with the ice cream you are making, and I'm still learning. My husband loves the add-ins feature. I have been wanting a ice cream maker for quite awhile, with no muss, no fuss and this is it."
4,soft serve ice cream maker,"Had a lot of fun with this machine. Cleans up easy, makes a great product. Would like to be able to make a little more at one time for a larger crowd. Makes enough for about 8 prople at one time, then you have to re-freeze the bowl. I would buy it again."
4,Good reference for toddler development,"I purchased this book soon after my son's first birthday. It is organized with month by month descriptions of toddler development in language, physical skills and personality. I enjoyed reading the monthly sections throughout the year. It gave me some idea of what to expect, although the authors do point out that individual development is unpredictable. The book was written over 20 years ago and has a few dated references. (I don't think too many parents have their toddlers listening to phonograph records these days!)"
1,worse david Decoteau movie,"First let me say that I am a big David DeCoteau fan. I have enjoyed that mix of the homoerotic and horror film that he does so well. I was so disappointed in this movie. While the photography was great and the location was great, and the story was great for a horror film, it failed. The plot was not freshed out enough, the back story was lost , two of the hottest guys were never undressed. The most disappointing was that the erotic was missing from the whole film. I know it was made in 4 days and on a limited budget, but his otherl low budgets are better. Not worth buying. But I am still a fan"
2,STUPID MOVIE,"Its about a group of collage guys staying at a cabin in the woods, doing dum stuff to get into a fraternity. Theres a guy killing them with an axe. The murder scenes, you dont really see them getting killed. Just a guy holding an axe. All the boys are running around in their underwear. Its a real stupid movie. Wouldnt recommend buying this dvd."
1,Tooty fruity anyone?,"Ok so apparently being a little what's the word oh yeah! gay is a given with the reviewers of this movie.No review starts off with Holy crap this Dave guy has got to be a priest or ex-con or just plain gay.This is what you're in store for in this movie: A barely watchable slasher flick with two scenes where five teenage boys wearing only there under wear are blasted with a hose, and then theres the scene where they all take turns washing themselves in the shower, and then more slashing action with extremely limited special effects, then mercifully the end.This is obviously targetting people who want to look at teen boys wearing as little as possible for as long as the premise of the movie allows.Judging by other of Dave's previews for his other brotherhood movies this guy has found his mark but be forwarned if you don't want to be looking at a handful of teen dudes bouncing aroung the woods in their underwear for the most part of the movie then you could easily skip this one."
4,"""My cousin played the bass""","The album was pretty good. I remember helping them make copies of cassettes back in 1996 and wondering ""I wish there was a faster way to make copies and make them sound better."" RIP J.A.Y."
4,Sorry About The Packaging,I worked for Tsuburaya Productions and was in charge of overseeing this product. All of the proper info was sent to the video company for them to print the episode titles on the back and synopses inside. But as near as I can tell they ignored everything I sent them. It's kind of sad. I no longer work for them anyway. I yelled and screamed when I saw this.The plus side is you can spot me in episode 51 as BOTH of the American pilots who get blown up by the evil flying monster about midway thru the episode.
3,Wish it was in English,"I ordered this video for my son. It came quickly and in the condition expected. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that it was in Japanese with subtitles. My son really hasn't watched it much like he has with his other English speaking Ultraman video."
1,What happened to the REAL songs?,"If you seen the ""Cirque Ingenieux"" on television and want the music on it - it's not here. Instead of the French singer, we get this lady humming notes (that she can barely keep); a kind of no-frills version of the stage production. The guitars are completely missing - it is less dramatic. As hard as it was to find, I had to throw it away because it didn't have the mysterious power of the original tv production. (I'll give them a star for being able to completely fool me though! )"
3,"If you've seen the video, don't buy the soundtrack","When the soundtrack was released, it was obviously before the stage production hit the road. Great vocals replaced with hums and aaahs, different versions of pieces you've seen in the video. Colleen Ryan (the Angel) was the reason I wanted this CD and she is barely a part of this soundtrack. Recommended for Kitaro fans but skip it if you want what's on the video."
4,Very much like Cirque Du Soliel - Great Music,If you like the music of Cirque Du Soliel - you'll like this CD. I don't know about his other music but this is a good CD. I really enjoy it.
5,This book has been replaced by software,The publisher has replaced this book with software called the Wireless Travel Guide. It's updated every month and ships on CD-ROM for Macintosh or Windows. You can search the web to find it.
3,Amadeus: More Music etc was not exactly what I expected.,"I was hoping they were giving me the movie score, not a compilation made after the movie was popular.It is OK but I will sell it back on Amazon."
1,Long Line,I ordered this game Sept 2006. Was the line I was standing in really this long? Was this the bonus part?
5,Possibly the best music written in the past 15 years!,"My aunt introduced me to the wonderful music of Kitaro when I was small. I listened to Kojiki a lot. Then about 4 years ago, I got an album titled ""Mandala"". After the first track my mind was blown! It is THE best the Master has done, even better than Kojiki! Of course, by brothers destroyed the disc in short order, so maybe this place can facilitate the process of replacement..."
1,fell apart in 7 months,"After 6 months of use, the leather inside the toe cover of the right slipper has separated from the sole. I've had other slippers that lasted years. Will not buy these again."
2,Too damn small,I ordered a half size up and the fit is a travesty. I probably needed to order a size and a half up. The sliipers are also too narrow and they don't offer an EE if you need a wider slipper then a medium you need to go all the way to EEE. Does this company even have a quality control department. How hard is it to make a mold for a slipper that is the actual damn size its supposed to be. Besides that the slippers are fine as in besides that Mrs Lincoln how was the play.
3,Nice,"This item was everything its description claimed to be. My only reason for not giving it a higher rating is that the actual comfort of the item could be better. The quality of manufacturing and the materials are exceptionally high. However, if a man is looking for more comfort than dress, he might continue shopping. The cushion on this product is a bit slim."
1,Inexcusably too small,"Based on other reviews, I ordered one size larger than I wear. (I ordered 11.5, rather than 10.5.) Even then the slipper is much too small.It's not rocket science for a shoe company to be able to properly assign sizes to their shoes, but it seems to be beyond L.B. Evans."
4,Full Leather is Good,Very comfortable. My old slippers (two pair) collected dog hair and dust on them... to be dropped everywhere else in the house. These stay clean.
1,Runs at least 2 sizes too small,"Do not waste your time or money on this brand.I ordered as a gift for my Brother, he wears a U.S Size 11.5. The reviews from their manufacturer's website stated they run between a half to whole size too small. So I ordered a size 13 and thought they may be a tiny bit too big. WRONG!!! He could not even get his foot into the slipper!"
3,Trying to be creative in place of the computer,"It wasn't quite what I expected, so I haven't found a use for it yet, but I'm sure I will in the future."
3,"workable, cheap materials, packed in styrofoam","this is a definite improvement in keeping our play room clean and organized. it takes much less time to chuck the toys into the proper bin than it is to get them back into their boxes. it is definitely wobbly, so placing it against a wall is a definite must and if your kids like to tug on things... it probably wouldn't be a good fit.it's easy to assemble-- just screw the rods into the sides. the sides are of pressed wood, the rods are actually metal (not wood as described), and the whole thing comes packed with a bunch of styrofoam."
4,Holds more than expected!,"We bought this unit for our family room, in an attempt to become more organized (so far, so good). We have now had it for several weeks, and I love it. Set up was very easy, no complications, it took my husband 10-15 minutes. It seems mostly sturdy - I agree with other posters that it could be tipped by a bumptious child climbing on it or yanking on it, and so I deducted one star. However, we haven't had that problem yet, and I think there would be a couple of different ways to stabilize it if it was needed. It holds a lot more than I had expected - we still have two bins mostly empty after cleaning up ALL of the smaller toys! Everything has its place, and my son (age 2) is able to understand how to put everything away when he's done, and so my family room has stayed relatively clean for the longest time in its history! I love this so much that I ordered two more for my kids' bedrooms, hoping to see similar results. I'll let you know!"
3,storage,"Good for storage, but overpriced. Also unit is unstable and could pull over easily, I mounted boards to bottom to stabilize it."
4,Would recommend,"Decent quality, does not tip over, easy to assemble, bins are a good size for small toys and books, balls, and puzzles."
1,Tipsy,"I bought this, built it, and came to the conclusion that there's a good chance my kid who will be pulling to a stand shortly has a great chance of pulling on this thing right down on top of her. There's a competing product that has extra feet on front and back that makes it much more difficult to tip over. With this one, the base is so narrow from front to back compared with its height that you apply the teensiest bit of force in a forwards or backwards direction near the middle or top and you create a pretty effective moment arm and it'll topple right over. I don't care how much lead weight you put in it. Widen the base and the force has to be much much bigger to get it to rotate forwards. I have an engineering degree and practice pediatrics. I don't like it."
4,Cute & Good Size!,"I ordered this product for the daycare that I run out of my home. It is very catchy with the colors and a good size. The only con I would say about this product is that it isn't very sturdy unless it is on a hard surface. The wooden rods fit great, just the overall product is a little wobbly. Still a great product and I would def. recommend!"
4,Just what I needed,This organizer was just what I was looking for. It is a good size but not too wide so it doesn't stick out that far from the wall. We don't have a lot of extra space so that was key. I liked how the rods that hold the plastic bins are metal so they will not break. This is NOT high end looking furniture but for the price it will get good use and then I won't feel bad when it is time to get rid of it. Looks very nice in our daughters room. I would recommend to friends.
5,Awesome for storage!,I bought this to store all of my son's things. I love that the colors would work for both a boy or girl. I'm slightly disappointed that the yellow bins are more vibrant than in the picture only because I'm not much of a yellow fan but it still looks great and really helps keep our home organized. It's also nice that the bins are easy accessible for kids to reach in and find what they want without having to dig in a toy chest. I also thought this was going to be a bit bigger than it actually was which is nice for apartment life.
5,great organizer,the perfect organizer for my little grandson. he can easily find toys and then easily see where to put then back when done
5,12-Bin Organizer,"I bought this for my 3-year old grandson for Christmas. He has a playroom in the basement and had only a toy box for his toys. Some of his toys were getting lost and damaged by just throwing them in the toy box. This organizer lets him see where his toys are quickly. His mom and dad have certain toys in certain bins; cars in one; trains in another,etc. They play a game with him where he puts all the like toys away in the correct bin."
3,Not safe,"As a storage organizer, it works fine. The rack is very attractive, with several sizes of colored bins that work well to hold small toys. Assembly was very easy with just having to put the rods between the two ends and screw them in. However, there is no strap or bracket to hold it to the wall. It is just a matter of time before a child pulls this over. We had a similar product from another company that indeed fall over on my son. I ended up having to install the brackets (which it came with) to the wall. This one has nothing to attach it and prevent it from tipping over. I wrote the company about this and they ignored me, so apparently their support isn't very good either."
4,no more clean up,"These organizing buckets have allowed our playroom to stay more tidy. It also teachers our children how to organize in proper bins, with the varying sizes. The side panels are a little wobbly, but the price is right!"
2,Not what I thought I would get :(,"We bought this Organizer for the baby toys. I liked the idea (still do!), when it arrived it was well packed, nothing missing or broken, everything fit well (and had the right length ;-) and it was easy to put together. The plastic bins are bright and seem to work if you don't throw them around. The construction itself seems fine and steady...BUT: the so called ""The toy organizer's frame features sturdy pine wood construction with a natural finish"" is actually pressed plywood with a plastic-film what 'wants-to-look-like-wood' on it! Really disappointing!! Very cheap looking!!!I would have send it back but it arrived a few days before our trip over seas and when we got back and unpacked it, it was to late to return it.We might use it in the garage to put the beach toys in it because it does look shabby (and not chic!) anywhere else.Again, the whole concept could work if the promised wood wouldn't have been missing."
2,rickety,This is nice to look at but not stable at all. The frame will come apart before too long. If you have a grandson like mine all he has to do is step on the bottom rung once and the whole thing is destroyed. The bins will last thought. If you want to pay $50 for a dozen plastic bins you could get at the dollar store.
1,shipped broken,I purchased this for my grandson thinking it would be perfect. It arrived with several broken parts and had to be sent back
1,LISTED DIMENSIONS ARE WRONG! BUYER BEWARE,"I bought this because it very specifically listed the width as 32 4/5 inches WIDE by 35"" TALL, and I needed something to be exactly 33 inches or less - THIS UNIT IS 35"" WIDE AND 32"" TALL.. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Went together super fast!,The estimated build time was a joke for me. I had it together in around 15 minutes with my toddler trying to climb all over me while building and it looks great. It was perfect for all those multi piece toys like blocks and tea sets. And even with it jam packed it still makes her toys look organized.
3,Not Worth The Price,"I have the organizer in primary colors. It's nice for kids (older kids, not little kids) and we use it for lego organization. I received this as a gift. If I had to purchase it for myself, the cost would have been a big hinderance. Overall, the product is cheap and a bit unsturdy."
4,Love it!,"I bought this and was concerned that it was going to be tiny. It works wonderful! easy to put together. It didnt fit ""big toys"" but it fit everything else. very sturdy!"
5,All of the pieces came intact on time. Same quality as appeared in ad,All of the pieces came intact on time. Same quality as appeared in ad. My daughter loves the table. She is 5 and it fits her perfectly.
5,Love it!!!,This product has helped alot with keep my sons room clean. He is two years old and loves all kinds of cars and well boy toys!!! So keeping them divided helps him find his stuff easier. Also with keeping the little stuff in the bins his toy chest is neater. Over all well worth it in everyway.
5,useful and pretty!,"very practical, good materials and nice look! easy way to keep toys organizedI bought the book holder from the same brand also"
4,Perfect solution for toys,This organizer has proved to be the perfect solution for my children's toys. It is durable and keeps a lot of the smaller toys organized and has been a keeper of barbie dolls. I am happy with this product
4,Great item for the price,"This toy bin does exactly what I needed it to do. It is fairly sturdy, and the brightly colored bins are at the perfect height and accessibility for my two-year-old. She can now see all of her toys more clearly, so she plays with them more. It also makes it easier to sort where things go, keeping her play room neat and allowing her to help more with clean up. The only thing I don't like is that then angle of the shelves can make it difficult to pull the bins out sometimes, especially if they are full. Overall, I like it though, and might buy a second one for her bedroom."
4,fantastic!,"A great way to keep all the little toys off the floor, and encourage your child to help pick up their room. The bins are of a light but sturdy construction, and the lip of them is big enough to make a decent handle for your child to take the bin off the rack and carry it.I did have an issue with one of the screws not fitting into the hole at the end of the pole when constructing it... I had to screw it in part way to bore out the hole more. other than that, it was quick to assemble."
5,Excellent Source,This is a must have book for any geneology / family history researcher. It covers every kind of printed source you can find important family history information in. Easy to understand and well worth it to have on hand for reference. I have used mine several times and I only work on geneology sporadically.
4,printed sources book,"arrived quick, in perfect condition and was exactly what i wanted. i am very pleased with this transaction and will order again."
2,Not for the beginner,"This software is easy to use, but not for the Spanish beginner. It is truely just a translation tool and does not even contain all words in the spanish language. You can see the tense of several verbs, but you cannot type in a phrase, it is a single word translator. If you are new to the language, spend your money on something with sentence structure & better vocabulary."
2,Not too impressed,"I bought this VHS tape with high hopes! I heard it raved about from several websites, so I was really excited to get it. It's pretty boring, though. Hard to follow, not due to its being complicated, but because the narrator speaks so slowly that by the time he finishes his sentences, you've already forgotten what he was talking about.Not recommended. Try ""Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet"" instead; it's much better."
4,Does just what it says,"I am a casual dart play with a board in my basement. I think these tips work well for what I need. I don't play every night, but maybe a few times every couple of weeks. I don't notice them breaking more than I would expect, and if I somehow manage to break all 250 tips that I got in this order, I would probably buy them again."
1,"1 throw, that's all!",These tips are practically worthless. You're incredibly lucky to get more than one throw before the tip breaks. What a brittle piece of garbage.
3,mas present,I have no idea what DVD is like. I purchased this as a gift for my grandson and he has not entirely watch complete movie yet.
3,shoe boot,This shoe boot is okay for the money but I discovered the Timberland outlet where you can buy a much better quality shoe book for the same price as these. If you can't locate a Tim' outlet then these will do fine.
3,The pacific Between by Raymond K. Wong,A nice story but a few too many characters to keep track of...and too many unlikely coincidences. Enjoyed the sights and smels of Hong Kong.
5,Thank you,I had a house fire so I am thankful to be able to replace my library little by little!! The book was in great shape and cost effective.
5,Understanding the Bible better,"If you want to learn the Bible the way it was meant to learned, this Vine's along with a Strong's concordance will help you. I would also recommend Zondervan's Bible Dictionary. These tools will help you with an objective view rather something mystical."
4,Excellent book. A must have,"This is an excellent book. However I agree with a previous comment that it's better to have also Strong's concordance. I do not agree with ""Athens"" comment giving an evaluation of only two stars. Vine's expository dictionary is giving excellent definitions and explanations, at least for the NT Greek words, and I know what I am talking about as I studied ancien Greek for 6 years...in GREECE!! Therefore, there is only one possible recommendation: BUY IT ...together with Strong's concordance."
2,Could be better reletivily speaking,"There is nothing wrong with this dictionary. But recently I have found other bible dictionaries that are much better. Instead I recommend the bible dictionaries by IVP press who share alot more information. They have a whole set of them. They are a little bit more expensive but much better than the Vines... the three best ones are the folowing,Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry & Writings (The IVP Bible Dictionary Series)Dictionary of New Testament Background (The IVP Bible Dictionary Series)Dictionary of the Later New Testament & Its Developments (The IVP Bible Dictionary Series)"
2,Learn ACT!2000 NOT for the advanced user,The cover says that this is a book for advanced users. How come they spend 21 pages on installing the software. Do you know an advanced user who needs 21 pages to install a piece of software?In the section about modifing templates they fail to mention that there is hidden text at the beginning of the document that if deleted will cause you document not to be added to your history tab.This is a beginners book.
3,Work but my dogs won't eat them unless there coated in peanut butter,This product definitely works if you give it to them as directed but my dogs will not eat them right out of the container. I have to completely coat them with a lot of peanut butter or my dogs will spit them out on the floor. I've also tried the shed defense soft chews and they love those. I'm not sure if it's the smell or the hard pill that they don't like either way it's a pain to have to coat 3 pills a piece for each dog to get them to eat the tablets. I will stick with the soft chews.
1,Dog won't eat them!,"My dog won't touch these vitamins, whereas, he gobbles up his NUVets. Will stick with the NUVets."
4,Good Vitamin,Purchased this for our Blue Doberman Pinscher who suffers from color dilution alopecia. It is helping her skin and coat from becoming so dry and irritated.
5,An excellent tutorial and reference,"It is always a wonderful thing to find an excellent technical reference that is also highly *readable* - the enthusiasm of the authors for the subject is obvious to the reader and their pragmatic approach most welcome.Regardless of if you are an experienced developer or beginner, I believe you will find a wealth of information in this book to justify the purchase. (I found the sections on how tomcat manages classloading and security of particular interest).I believe that if your primary development and deployment platform is tomcat then this book will be of great use. Although this book is somewhat Windows centric, those of us who use real operating systems (i.e. Unix based derivatives) will still find real value from this book.The authors obviously have deep experience with the platform andI can only highly recommend this book to anyone working with Tomcat"
3,"A good effort, but this is no Bible of Apache Tomcat.","This book is a good effort. Unfortunately it is geared very much towards windows. I found myself on many occasions surfing the net to get the proper way of installing/modifying tomcat for linux as this book only gave windows instructions and ""assumed"" (falsely) that it would be somewhat identical for other OS. Fortunately the Internet was full of info on doing this on Linux, but a reference book on Tomcat should have covered it, specially when it calls itself the ""Apache Tomcat BIBLE"".If you are a windows user and plan to use windows on your server, then this is a good book for you. For those of us who use Linux and other OS on their server... maybe another book would do better justice to Apache Tomcat."
3,Well-written reference; light on Struts,"Unlike Tomcat Kick Start, this book tells you explicitly that you cannot use servlets as <welcome-file> for your app. This minor but annoying quirk is not documented in the official online doc nor Google-able - indication that the authors did their homework!Well-organized overall, with the familiar Bible-format. Ant and another Jakarta tool got their own chapters. However, the short shrift given to Struts (<10 pages) and the lack of practice projects (the downside of the Bible-format) prevent me from giving it a higher score."
1,Not Worth The Paper,"This is one of those typical ""re-hash the existing documentation"" books. In my own opinion it's poorly written and never attempts to explain. Well, maybe it *does* attempt to explain but it fails miserably. You might as well read the equally bad documentation that comes with Tomcat.Of course, like so many rotten books, it adds bulk by including pages on so many non-Tomcat issues like Ant, Struts, SOAP, IDEs, etc. I kept expecting a recipe for Tuna Casserole on the next page.I have this book but I'm getting rid of it. I made the mistake of buying it after reading a review (probably written by one of the authors) here on Amazon."
5,A starting place for those seeking to fully understand life,"I have simply never read another book like Life & Consciousness! Within the pages of an engaging and compelling story are the details of the path that one man followed to a complete, scientific understanding life. Although the content covers an entire panorama of the universe, it is a sincere, upfront, enjoyable, clear and understandable story. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand life and man's place in the universe!"
4,Civilization 3 gold,"Game was very good, delivery was prompt and the service rendered was excellent.However the seller needs to include more of a description of the product because I had originallythought the product contained more. However the seller didn't give a detailed enough description of their product."
4,Superb! Easy to do a 5star mod,"This game is different from Civ2 in many ways, butthe important things are the same.I would give 5 stars if the corruption & waste were not so crippling - I won't play a stock game again, waiting dozens of turns for a small wonder to get built with 90% waste - I did a mod to cut the waste. Now it plays like a dream.It is very easy to do mods that make the game new again - look on the web for ideas, then play with the editor - years of fun!Add resources for a very challenging mod with good realism.The one serious problem is adding techs - making a pretty tech tree is really rough."
4,A Good Strategy Game,"I purchased this game for my spouse. She plays it often, as we are frequently on holiday. The artificial intelligence seems to present life-like behaviour from the foreign nations. After seeing Civilization IV, the graphics are lacking in comparison, but that is neither here nor there. This game is well worth the few dollars that it cost to purchase it. It will keep my wife busy for quite some time."
3,"Good value, but...","The game is fantastic, it's fun educational (for you parents), and more fun!!!With 24 civilazations you can play as, 4 time periods in which you have to discover many technologies, and city managment from deciding what kind of things to build to telling exactly what to build is great, and with the multi-player feature it's impossible to turn down! NOTE: First game i've ever seen where two people can play on the same computer!!!Only one problem, if your planning to get conquests too, get the original game. all the extra features in this game are from the Play-the-world expansion pack and in conquests too.Overall it's the best, just better for the wallet to get the original and conquests."
2,Awesome game. Just don't buy this Version!,"Basically you can purchase the Conquests version for a little more money and it's the Gold edition with a few more features. Plus if you buy this version, you will NOT be able to play multi-player with others (most people) who have the Conquests edition.Love the game, but I should have researched before buying."
5,Wonderful!,"I purchased this with the hopes of creating a devotional time with my kids that would be encouraging and age appropriate. After reading it the first night before bed, my kids ages 7 and 9, have asked to read it every night since. The devotions discuss topics that apply to them and are easy to understand. After reading, we have had many wonderful conversations and have been able to apply it directly to them. I absolutely love this book and the oppurtunities it has provided."
5,A Great Way To Spend Time With Family,I have throughly enjoyed leading my family in daily devotions with book series. It prompts lots of questions from my two children and opens dialog about daily Christian living. I highly recommend this series for your family.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"First off, let me say I ONLY play first-person shooters. Suffice to say, I have an experience base for this review.The game play is absolutely horrible: There is no such thing as sniping in this game (yes, I know there are sniper weapons). Even when you do get off a clear shot, any obstruction within a few feet will block the bullets trajectory.The graphics are horrible: I rank this up there with Super Nintendo in terms of realism and pixelation. Most absurd is that you can be literally standing on top of an enemy and not even know it.Other things to consider, especially if you enjoy the fluidity of games like Halo: Your player is slow, the enemy is fast. Your weapons are unexciting, aiming is impossible, so you are relegated to the good 'ole fashioned bumb rush attack. Loading and saving are annoyingly slow.I recommend you skip this and save your money for Halo when it comes out next year. Sorry Activision, try again."
1,SOLDER OF FORTUNE II DOUBLE HELIX,"Took a month to get the game, when i got it the game did not work. Sent a email about the game with no response."
4,old guy review,"I am not sure what the other reviewers are looking for in a game but Soldier Of Fortune is well above average. Perhaps they are comparing it to Halo or Splinter Cell but this one is fun to play. Just like Hitman, you can save at anytime, so when you die, you don't have to go all the way back to the beginning of the level. The number of weapons is amazing..especially the OICW. The graphics are on par with Hitman, Ghost Recon, Brute Force and, unlike Commandos 2, you don't have to search for tiny enemies behind trees that look like they were drawn by a 4 year old. It is fast paced without a lot of storyline, such as in Max Payne, etc. You have to use your brain to figure out where to go, what strategy to use, though not as intensely as Indiana Jones. The only complaint I would have is that when you are scrolling on the D pad to change weapons, the bad guys still shoot at you...not fair...they should have more manners."
2,not that great,I bought this game hoping it would be a great game.It was not so goodat all.I thought It would be a game like medal of honor or ghost reconbut it was not.Rent this game before buying it.
2,You have got to be kidding!,"This game is a major dissapointment. While the concepts is interesting, the graphics are terrible and gameplay is lousy at best."
1,Double Failure,"This game is an absolute insult to the gaming capabilities of the xbox.Graphics - on par with a second grade PS One game.Ambience - Repetitive sounds and lack of sound control (crouching produces as much foot-noise as walking) destroy any hopes of creating any element of suspense.AI - rather read as AS for Artificial Stupidity.Controls - they work well (hence the single star).Overall, I recommend that if you are looking for a FPS, save your money and wait for the releases of Ghost Recon (Island Thunder) or Medal of Honor (Rising Sun)."
3,"excellent, but",I picked this up because I was so impressed by Wolf Hall. Probably I enjoyed Wolf Hall as much as I did because I know something about the period. I was very confused by Place of Greater Safety - I think I'll study the French Revolution and then go back and re-read it. I'd give this book five stars for those who already know the history.
3,There is a great 400 page book in this,"I loved Mantel's writing style in Wolf Hall and I am a big fan of Andrej Wajda's great movie Danton. I know very little of French revolution except that there was a lot of chop-chop at the neckie. So, I was looking forward to reading this long very long book.There is too much of soap in the book which distracts from the political drama. If someone can wash-off 200 pages of the soap , this good book would be a great 400-500 page book."
2,A Place of Greater Safety,Subject matter was tedious and depressing. The French Revolution was run by terrorists. The revolutionary leaders got what they deserved.My heart remains with the aristocrats.
3,Way too much information,"It seems to me that the editor and Ms Mantel could have created a much better piece of literature if they would have left off about half of the book. The author writes in a unique style and at times the reader has no idea of who is talking or of whom they are discussing. Although the history is fascinating, it would have been even more so had the book been edited better and they would have left out half of the words."
3,Not as impressed as I hoped,"Being a retired history teacher, I enjoy novels with an historical background and had devoured ""Wolf Hall"". However, I found "" A Place of Greater Safety"" quite a struggle to read, although I am familiar with the period in which she sets it --the French Revolution--and the characters, such as Robespierre and Danton. I felt there were too many characters of little importance to contribute and her style surprisingly turgid. Often, the domesticity became quite boring, in light of the tumultuous happenings, although I understand she was attempting to show the impact (or lack of same) on other family members/friends. Having said that, she has redeemed herself with her latest!"
2,Disappointing,"This book takes three main characters involved in the French Revolution and follows them from boyhood through to the Revolution and the ghastly time of the Terror. On the whole Mantel does this convincingly and with great empathy, relating the characters' interior monologues and intrigues, as well as providing a more omniscient interpretation. However for me the novel didn't really work beyond the first 500 pages (it is very long, at approx pages). We lose track of the multitude of characters as the author become more and more involved in writing a history of the period, and less and less involved in making a novel that engages and carries forward the reader. In the end, I gave up at around page 600."
5,I like that book,A great book. I'm waiting for Mantel to choose another historic subject and write a book to match this one. She's unique when she wants to be.
2,A Place of Greater Safety,"I just read the excellent history on the French Revolution by Sylvia Neely, and turned next to Hillary Mantel to bring that history to life in the form of her fiction. It didn't happen. I stopped reading after 150 pages, convinced that it would never happen. I longed for being there, experience the atmosphere, but all that Mantel served were some dull desprictions of the characters and interactions between them. So I'm still looking for some good (modern) fiction on the French Revolution. Let me know if have something.Marcel, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"
1,Manages to make the French Revolution dull,"Have no idea how Mantel managed to do this, but by keeping every iconic scene ""off-camera"" despite this being a 700 page tome, she's managed to make a novel about the French Revolution dull and plodding. Characterization is poor, with many key characters indistinguishable all the way til the end, focus is off so we have side characters appearing briefly centre-stage then disappearing forever, and the style shifts abruptly from play-like dialogue to stream of consciousness to newspaper reports with little purpose behind it. A truly amateurish effort and really, really badly edited. Can't believe the author won a Booker - she must have improved vastly or had connections with the literary establishment. If you don't like it a quarter of the way in I would suggest you not waste your time on this novel. I rarely return books but simply had to with this one."
5,The Razor's Edge,"Everything about this book is huge- its length, its scope, its cast, and its research. Mantel takes us to the razor's edge- showing how those brilliant men who engineered and orchestrated the French Revolution and its ideals lost control of their creation and became victims themselves of the Terror. It is immensely readable, with engaging, complex characters. Mantel does an excellent job of portraying Robespierre, Desmoulins and Danton in a way which leads readers to be sympathetic towards them while also being horrified of what they were party to. An excellent read for anyone who finds the French Revolution fascinating, and a wonderful novel overall."
2,A Study in confusion,"The idea of this novel is quite a good one; to depict the French Revolution from inside the private lives and thoughts of the revolutionaries. The sense of the revolution or the amabiance is created but the writing in terms of simple rules of identifying whoever is speaking, thinking or being talked about is so abysmally neglected that the reader spends too much time trying to figure out what is happening. Sometimes it is so bad that the subject shifts even in the personal pronoun being changed from masculine to feminine within the same paragraph with the line of thought continuing. I had to force myself to finish the book and after two tries gave up on the five hundreth page as just not being worth it."
2,The French Revolution from a different perspective,"I'd already read Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies, both of which I adored. This is Hilary Mantel's first novel (I think) and it shows. I couldn't finish it - too many characters introduced very early on and very quickly. I rarely give up on a book, curiosity usually drives me on, but not with this one. Read her other books instead. Sorry"
4,A Place of Greater Safety by Hilary Mantel,"Love the book, Hilary M really gets behind the scenes in history, lots of detail of daily life in France at the time"
2,Tedious,"Unlike the Cromwell novels, which I found hard to put down, this thing drags on and on, and keeping track of the cast of characters is torture."
3,a noble attempt,"a noble attempt to create a linear passage for the reader in dealing with the complex issues of the French revolution i suppose the book could have had more impact if a more finite slice of time was used as it tends to get diluted and difficult to understand as the book progresses and continual characters are added Mantels soaring cromwell novels are far superior and you can see her ""working it out' here as she matures as a writer"
2,Just could not follow...,"I really tried, but way too many characters and too much jumping around....Just when I would get a handle on a character the story would switch to someone new....In a word...disjointed."
2,Dark and Stormy Night does the Revolution,"An over-acted anachronistic costume drama of a book.In a novel about 18th Century France, a line like ' ""That bloody church is freezing,"" he said. ' is absurdly bad writing, bloody being such a specifically Anglo expletive, and there being no need to indicate that the character said anything, the quotation marks having already done the job.I will give Wolf Hall a try because of all the trumpets and the hoopla. But warily."
1,A place of greater safety,Tried to put too much into it & ended up with a most unsatisfactory confusing mish-mash of fact & fiction
2,Too wordy and too detailed,"I gave A Place of Greater Safety a two. Obviously, Mantel learned much from writing this book before the Cromwell books. It is too wordy, diffciult to keep track of characters. It is just becoming itneresting and I've already read 50% of the book."
4,Modern Flamenco from Granada,"Marina Heredia was dissatisfied with this album. It may have been song selection and its popular arrangements, but for me it is still a very fine recording, produced by Pepe de Lucia, brother of Paco. Marina Heredia is daughter of El Parrón, Jaime Heredia, and comes from the Sacromonte district of Granada, a center of flamenco. Perhaps she did not like all the up-tempo pieces, which are tangos, rumbas, bulerías, a taranto and an alegría. Her subsequent album was more intimate and varied in tempo. Lyrics are included in the notes and credits. Various other musicians provide traditional flamenco guitar, palmas, and percussion. Electric bass guitar and chorus are also present. Her voice style is contemporary smooth and suited for ballads. Together the album has a modern, popular feeling but not jazzy flamenco nuevo. She is true to her deep roots."
1,fat burner which doesn't really work!,I ordered this product just over a month ago and have yet to see the results! I feel that it effects your hormones (females) and changes the dates of certain things for the females! I am not sure if it's associated with the product but it happened to me after I started using it. Unfortunately the only change I noticed was a negative one and I have yet to loose inches and weight. I would not recommend this product but would recommend that you save your money.
2,Beware climber-toddler parents...,"We bought this thinking it would be perfect for our 16 mo old son. And it was, except he only wanted to use it for climbing. The seats are very, very low to the ground which make it perfect as a step stool to climb onto the table. Also, given the low seats, he couldn't really sit on them either because his bottom was below his knees. So, if you have a climber in the family, and/or a taller child, beware."
4,Great little table and his buddies all love it,"This table is great. The assembly was pretty easy. It does require you to drill the nails into the plastic which was a little strange but not hard to do. The table can adjust to have an angle for kids to draw more easily but so far I have never put it on that setting for him (he's a little over 2 years old) because it's not as easy as they make it seem. And when my son wants to draw, there's just no time to mess with the setting. One more thing I want to mention is that we have the table on wood floor, and the bottom is slippery on the wood floor so it slides all over the place. So I had to put some non-skid padding on the feet to make the table stay in place."
3,use a screwdriver you don't mind stripping,"Good quality table with safe rounded edges, but small. It's good for a 1-2 year old; just watch out for him/her falling backwards.The building of the table was horrible. I'm left with raw knuckles and a partially stripped screwdriver. The problem stems from driving screws into the plastic at very very difficult angles. As a result, you will end up applying force on the screw (while driving it in) at an angle that isn't 90' perpendicular to the surface. The screws don't go in straight and you end up scrapping your knuckle as you twist.In summary, good product after it's assembled, but little thought put into how it will be assembled."
4,good deal,"Easy to build, very sturdy.. we've been using for 2 years now.. my oldest daughter is now 4 and the youngest is 2.. they use it to eat, draw, play.."
5,great workout,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I like the personal trainer feel. The reminders on breathing, posture, going at your own rate and no music. All the attention is focused on body movement. It's been perfect.The workout is hard and leaves me sore afterward but feeling stronger each time."
5,A great video,"I just started this routine, but the video is great and really targets the areas. I know I will be sore tomorrow! Just one thing to note that I didn't know before I started - this is a long video, so make the time for it. The beginner section was 1 hr 15 minutes. I haven't moved on (after all, I'm on day 1) to tell if the others are that long, but I imagine so. So if you are looking for a 20 minute video, this is not for you. I found myself wondering when it was going to be over around the hour mark. I think I may have even cursed Joey a bit :) Just something to consider. The production quality is basic, but the moves are intense. Great video overall."
5,Nice camera with manual zoom,"Bought it second-hand and took it to a trip immediately. Amazingly light-weight and easy to use. I like manual zoom more than electric zoom, for obvious reason. Photos were sharp and colour natural. The battery that came with the camera did not hold long, possibly too old, and extra batteries are required. Overall, a reliable camera with a brand name that guarantees quality."
3,mediocre,"First, the zoom lens needs to be a little wider angle capability. Close-in shots are difficult to make because one cannot zoom out enough. Secondly, the camera is not compatible with the operating system that I use on my computer. It is not designed to be used with the new Microsoft VISTA. Currently there is not even a work arounnd, although Leica has been promising some sort of software repair, for more than a month, but to date nothing has developed. Taking photos and not being able to process them is not acceptable."
4,Great for those with a little experience.,My boyfriend and I had been discussing anal for a while and I had never done it and had little play back there at all. I decided to get this so we could make the next step to full intercourse and I was not disappointed! It's a great toy but a little wide if you want to have it in as a full plug while you do other things.
4,Too Big for Me,"Great, basic anal plug, but it's a little big for me. Oh well, gives me something to work up to!"
4,Chicano Eclectic,"This album has a variety of voices representing the Chicano community and the movement expressed through music. From its hip hop rhythms to its haunting indigenous sounds, it is a breakthrough for what young people are producing today. The best contribution coming from the group Ollin with its mixture of folk music, rock, alternative, and the mix of indigenous instruments. A must have if you enjoy non-mainstream music."
2,A bit less than just a reference,"Filled with logically structured variations, this book helps in no way to understand the opening. You have to find by yourself.But at least it's a huge reference on a not usual topic. It doesn't include ( like the book on the Grob ) a chapter of complete games, so it makes it a bit less useful than it's counterpart on the Grob by the same author."
3,better than nothing..,"I like playing B4 bc I have had great success with it, and not much readily available info on the opening. The book will not help you if you want explanations of a position. Its just a collection of moves. So its good in that at least you have something to look at but i would suggest you use this book with a chess program and have it analyse the game. This is time consuming and would have been nice if dont by the author but it is what it is. If you are looking for a book that explains the position i recomend Play B4 by everyman chess. But you will have more games in this book so this book can help when used with other material. My suggestion if you are new to the opening is start with everymans chess book. Once you feel comfortable and want to look at more games then use this book with a chess program."
4,Leather bib,"Only issue. Nothing noted about the retaining screw does not come with the bib. Had to purchase my own. Other than that, it's just what I needed, looks great and delivered on time."
3,Cliff Richard : King of UK music,"Cliff Richard is the most sucessfull domestic recoring artist of all-time with over 120 U.K hit singles under his belt, over the last 6 decades. This is a good sampler."
2,Just another compillation,"As a Cliff fan I get sad when he tries to be always releasing hits compilation. Officialy it's only six years since the release of The Hit List so it's not long. On the other hand he have released sevaral great Live videos during the same period, so why not drop a compilation and release a live album.It would also help his and other oldtimers general public popularity.Wether we like it or not if the public in general dosen't like an artist, the fans doesn't matter at all"
1,So terribly sorry...,"I bought my lovely wife this for Christmas...and immediately regretted it.So, as a Brit I feel I must apologise to the rest of the world for foisting this ""artist"" and his gutless, bland MOR pap (of which there is a ""good"" selection here) on you all. But at least America had the good sense (on the whole) to ignore him. But it all seems a tad unfair when they gave us Beefheart, Hendrix and the Beach Boys and we gave 'em THIS!?Oh the humiliation...."
2,It's not his fault,"Basil Khamis wins himself no friends with his sarcastic comment ""Cliff Richard, an accomplished guitarist & lead singer with a genuine feel for the music, was Britain's answer to Elvis Presley"". Ok, so Cliff wasn't much good but he always tried his best."
3,"Not much ""English Elvis""","Before the Beatles, Cliff Richard and the Shadows dominated the English pop music scene. He was frequently known as the ""English Elvis."" I was hoping for more of the early rock and roll period, but the CD is mostly Richard's later career, which is largely (to my taste) bland generic pop.The rock songs were good and I'm going to look for a CD which offers more of the early Cliff Richard."
2,lack of holding charge unplugged,"I am somewhat dissapointed with the fact that the charge does not hold up on the razor. It is good that it will still work with the cord. I do not know what guarantee that I had and would not have contacted Amazon, if you had not asked for my opinion."
1,shaver,I was very disappointed with the shaver. The battery would not stay charged and the shaver was extemly loud and the shave was not what I expected. I would not recommend this product.
2,Only two shaves,"I bought this shaver to replace my old MS3-1000, which was only lasting 6 or 7 shaves between charges. This one only lasted two shaves! And then it didn't work well with the cord until plugged in for a minute or two. Just to give the benefit of the doubt, I recharged it fully, then tried again. Exactly the same result. I sent it back for a refund!Then I bought an MS3-4700. It charged well. The electronic indicator showed 30 ""minutes"" and went down to 0 after about 15 minutes of shaving, but it still kept going on ""turbo"" speed for another half-hour! Keeping this one."
2,A little disappointed this time,"This is actually the second electric razor that I have purchased from this company and this one does not have the same power and the charge doesn't last that long on this unit. Also, for some reason, one of the micro screens wore out within 2 weeks and my wiskers are getting stuck in the screen. I'm not thrilled on this purchase."
5,Shaver,The first shaver I received had a problem with it. I returned this shaver to Discounts Jungle. They were excellent in helping to send a different shaver that my husband requested. We received them in 2 days. Excellent customer service and we were very impressed with the way they handled the whole situation.
1,Amazon needs to abandon this product,"When the shaver arrived, I charged it for a day. Then I used it for 2 or 3 minutes before the battery just exhausted. I got a replacement, it doesnt perform like the new one I bought 7 years ago. Only bought another for when I travel because the original one works better than this one. It also stops working after rinsing the head. It has a bad seal after it was serviced, instead of replacing it. I guess their trying to get by with as little as possible. Put new batteries and seals, and maybe your complaints will go down."
4,Best of third generation punk rock,"this album and 'the good the bad and the argyle' are two of the best punk rock albums ever put out by a band in the 90's. in a time filled with political punk rock and an ever-growing list of punk rock sub-geners (crust, grindcore, street, etc.) these guys made punk rock fun again. lyrics about beer girls and tv. the first two bouncing souls albums are better than their entire Epitath output combined. ""Ballad of Johnny X"" is my favorite song on this collection."
3,Not Bad - Not Great,"This DVD of pleasant solo jazz piano is good background listening (the same type you'd get in a lounge club), but I would by no means call it great. Good for light entertainment."
3,If you find it for free read it,You'll learn two or three things about family relations but:The love story is not even a story.The letters you may have to read them but they are so boring.The money family... this could be a spoiler so I won't write it but I don't thing someone in his/here sane judgment will keep it that way.
4,Amazing story,The experiences of a 15 year old setting out alone from New Jersey in a 24' sail boat with little sailing experience and the first stop is Bermuda! The book is a light read without a lot of characters to keep track of. There are a lot of lessons: As an example she didn't know that getting knocked down (tipped over) was one of a sailor's worst fears so she took it in stride when she was routinely knocked down in storms. The true hardship and the resolve to overcome it puts some of our petty daily problems into perspective. It is a true life adventure.There are a few slow areas to get past but overall it is a fast moving and certainly exciting read.
1,"Maiden Voyage, the Ultimate Cure for Insomnia","You know it's a bad sign when the copy you've checked out of the library was actually signed by Tania Abei. Someone went through the trouble of having her sign it (preteniously blathering on about fair winds in her inscription, mind you) and then donated the book to the public library because it was such a lousy read.Tania has taken something exciting as sailing around the world and put it into words in the most boring manner possible. Her writing lacks emotion. Her description of her love interests made me wonder if she was really describing her relationship with her brother. Her description of her cat falling overboard couldn't have been written with any less passion. She may as well lost a pencil overboard with the way she described her cat falling.I admit, I couldn't finish it. I got 2/3 of the way through and thought 'What is the point, Tania?'"
1,The Adventure Was Contrived,"Ms. Aebi has had a very difficult time both sailing and writing. To circumnavigate the world as the youngest woman ever wasn't her idea. It was pushed upon her by an egoistic father who in doing so threatened her life. Being a good girl and trying to win her father's love she helped him to abuse her. She reveals that her sailing knowlege was completely absent. She had little self discipline. She never writes about loving to sail. She writes about affairs and friendships with men whom she ends up depending on to get her from one port to the next. .... It was a ... way to come of age, and I'm sure she grew as a person. Her itinery was interesting and images of the south sea islands and the red sea remain. The trip was a fantastic adventure, but perhaps one day she can learn to sail."
3,Maiden Voyage review,"I was really excited to start reading this book, but as soon as I started I knew it was not going to be what I thought. There are very many nautical terms that if you are not familiar with, may be confusing at times. The author switches from one setting to another very quickly. I can't say this book is the most disappointing book I have read in my life, but it certainly is amongst the top ten. If you are familiar with nautical wording, then this book would be fine for you. I was not so therefore, was expecting a different type of story."
3,Maiden Voyage Shipwreck!,"Alone, Tanya Aebi started her voyage to circumnavigate the world, with a vauge sense of seamanship. She drifts in and out of topics causing confusion for the reader. Her writting is choppy and unclear and her journey seems more significant than her writting. If your a boater you can relate to her terminology and get more mentally involved in her story, if not she does a poor job of pulling the reader in. But, the book is very inspiring and I admire her courage and skills."
4,A hobbit goes sailing,"Well, not exactly, but there are plenty of parallels.More or less thrown into this journey by a zany, wizard-like father, Tania begins her Tolkienesque voyage with no real understanding of the difficulties involved. After experiencing many adventures, some real dangers, and even a bit of romance, she returns home a wiser, stronger, and altogether more mature woman. Heartwarming, authentic, and honest, Tania proves herself to be a sailor and author in the tradition of the grandfather of single-handed circumnavigators, old Slocum himself.A page-turner."
4,You will 'blong' her too!,"This is a fantastic narrative of a 'special' father's way to deal with his unmotivated daughter. He bought her a boat and send her sailing (alone) around the world!What Tania did is extraordinary, even with the help of her dad, who flew around the world to bring her support and spare parts several times during her journey.Tania had no sailing experience (when she started) and made sailing her profession since the completion of her trip. She writes on every issue of Latitudes and Attitudes.Makes very interesting reading while is fun and informative."
3,Romantic adventure,"I am in awe of Tania Aebi's courage, leaving everything behind to face loneliness for weeks at a time is not for cowards. Her style all through the book is unpretentious, friendly and very honest. And yet the book feels curiously short in content. We read about how she played Solitaire for hours on end, how much each repair on the boat cost, what she ate etc. What we don't read about is her impressions of the places she travels to, the cultures she meets. Read Jonathan Raban's ""Journey to Juneau"" for the grown-up version of a solo sailing adventure."
4,For the armchair sailor,"I was given this book by some world cruisers as a gift. I was drawn into the story. Easy reading, I enjoyed a couple sections at a time imagining that I was taking the trip along with the author in her small boat. The description of some difficulties and hardships are honest and well described. I could almost the feel the frustrations of failed gear and unexpected experiences. In a few instances I was hoping for more details but not often. I'll share the book with my wife and daughter."
5,An excellent story of a romantic adventure,"I want to meet the author of this book. I felt like I was on the sail boat with her on all of her adventures. The story is one of adventure, risks, love, and self-awareness. An excellent story and very inspirational. A must have."
4,A Worthy Read for Strat-o-matic Fans,"As a long-time fan of the Strat-o-Matic baseball game, I found this book to be an enjoyable trip through the history of the company and the personal endeavors of its creator, Hal Richman. It won't make you a better SOM player, but it will help you appreciate how it came to survive through the decades."
4,Strat-o-matic Fanatics,"It was very touching story. Also brought back many fond memories, my own interest in sports strategy gaming had the same roots as Mr. Richman's. Escaping from an overbearing parent."
5,Raw Energy,"This compilation of songs brings back memories of the early stages of punk music. The revolutionary sounds of hard driving guitars and even harder driving vocals makes this cd one of my all time favorites. The recording quality sometimes borders on crude, but that fact only adds to the rebellious style of the music. It's interesting to note that some of the bands that made it out of the 80's and continued to record after that, have totally refined their sound to something a little more marketable. Not that it means they sold out, but people and music change and grow up, and band members come and go and the new members bring a new sound sometimes that can change a groups dynamics."
5,Tim Holt,"If you're as big a fan of Tim Holt as I am, than this set is for you. There's plenty of Tim Holt action. These are the kind of movies where the good guy is the good guy and hero of the movie. You can watch these movies with your kids and a bowl of pop-corn or with the guys, some pretzels and a bottle of beer. It's clean entertainment either way."
5,Tim Holt Western Classics CollectionVol. 3,I bought this collection for my husband and he has told me that this and the other Volumes are some of the best quality he has seen to date. I know he has Vol. 1 and 2 of this collection and would love to see them release a 4th vol. to complete all of Tim's great western movies. Thanks So Much..
5,Still the definitive work on American synagogue architecture,"Written more than 50 years ago, Wischnitzer is still the best book on the subject and every book on this subject in the last 50 years has been based at least in part on her selection of synagogues and her interpretations. Even if the reader's interest is limited to synagogues erected long after Wischnitzer's book, her book provides a historical context for understanding the newer synagogues."
1,Terrible Packaging,"This is a very nice product, but the packaging from the manufacturer is terrible. All 3 were broken the first time and 1 of the 3 were broken upon re-order. I cut my hand when trying to remove from box. What a waste to have such a beautiful product that cannot be delivered intact. What a small investment it would take to correct the problem."
2,Caddies for silverware,"Didn't care for these caddies. The caddies for my dinner forks and knives were too small for them to fit completely and you have to reach in to retrieve a utensil. If you have a party, too many hands will be reaching in and touching the other utensils. Also, the caddies are heavy and was expensive to ship back!"
5,The title of the CD says it all...,"Kitaro channels himself effectively through every instrument he plays. From the soulful electric guitar wailing of 'Mandala' (where I detect some David Gilmour influence - one lick in particular is from the song 'Hey You') to the delicate grace of 'Dance of the Sarasvati', the powerful 'Kokoro' to the beautiful strains of 'Silk Road' (among others) this is a CD that can be played again and again. Each song has a distinctive texture to it and the 'live feel' of the recording can give the impression that one is at the concert in person. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys music performed with passion and intensity. But those with 'MTV-itis' be warned: every song except one is over seven minutes long. (With some such as 'Kokoro' and 'Heaven and Earth' exceeding twelve minutes.) But then maybe this can be an aid to shedding the plague of short-attention-span that infects many of this generation. One can only hope anyway..."
3,Not what I expected,"I got this CD based on the reviews. I was unable to listen to any samples, as none were allowed for this album. It wasn't what I had expected. The music is generally of a different genre than what I had wanted, louder, more energetic. I wanted something more meditative, peaceful and contemplative. Doesn't say anything about the album and music itself, just about what I had expected and been looking for."
5,Best convertible car seat available,"This seat is worth every penny. I tried a Graco booster before this and it was terrible - cheaply made, no padding and straps that twisted every time my child went in or out. They also didn't tighten evenly either so that went back to the store.For the Consumer Report readers please note that European tests and American tests differ in terms of intensity. Europe does a much more thorough, government run test vs here where alot of it is the honor system.My child is over 5 but only 34 pounds and he fits snuggly in this seat and it is easy to get him in/out. He can also nap when needed because the sides give enough head support"
1,DO NOT BUY - - - - - -- - NOT SAFE,"This seat looks nice and my 20 month old son is comfortable in it. However, last week as we were driving he reached down between his legs, lifted up the lever and lossened the shoulder straps. He is not a genius - any 20 month old child can do the same. I can't believe that BRITAX has not recalled this car seat"
5,The best seat out there!,"I just purchased a marathon for my 4 month old son who is just too heavy for his snugride. I got this seat a couple of days ago and could not believe how quick and easy it was to install. I was a little worried it would be too big rear-facing, we have an X-Terra, but it fit perfectly behind the drivers seat and I didn't even have to move the seat forward to make it fit. My 2 year old daughter has the Eddie Bauer 3-in-1 Elite and it was a total nightmare to install rear-facing and would only fit in the middle seating position. I wish I had never bought it for that and many other reasons! I just ordered the Ashley Floral pattern for my daughter and can't wait to use it. For the safety, ease of install, and total convenience, you can't beat the value of Britax."
4,GREAT CARSEAT!,"I HAVE A 6 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WHO GREW OUT OF HER INFANT GRACO CARSEAT CAUSE OF THE WEIGHT LIMIT OF 20 LBS. I RESEARCHED FOR WEEKS FOR THE BEST CARSEAT THAT WAS THE SAFEST BUT ALSO COMFORTABLE FOR MY DAUGHTER. THE MARATHON IS IT! IT'S VERY BIG, BUT NOT HEAVY. IT ALSO RECLINES SO THAT IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE ONE LIKE I DO, THEY CAN STILL LAY BACK INSTEAD OF SITTING STRAIGHT UP. THE LATCHES ARE VERY EASY TO USE,AND THE CARSEAT IS VERY EASY TO INSTALL. MY DAUGHTER USE TO CRY EVERYTIME SHE HAD TO GET INTO HER OLD CARSEAT, WITH THIS ONE SHE HASN'T CRIED ONCE! THE CARSEAT CAN ALSO STILL BE USED FOR YEARS TO COME!"
5,Ashley Floral Marathon Convertible Car Seat,I absolutely love this car seat!! It is great. My daughter sits up high and has lots of room. The seat cover is very soft. The covers on the seat belt protect her neck from getting rubbed. The car seat is eay to install and very easy to put hook her in and out of it. It is the best car seat we have ever purchased and we have owned several-we have two children. I definitely recommend this convertible car seat! I tell all my friends who are expecting to spend a little bit more and it will save you in the end from buying seats for each stage as your baby grows. I know my daughter will be using this seat for many years to come. You definitely get what you pay for-It is worth every penny!!!!
3,BOOK ONLY not the Amazon service,"I ordered this book directly from Amazon and it came promptly. The book itself is somewhat confusing, it gives very simple example problems in the beginning sections and then you are expected to be able to solve very complex problems. The solutions in the back do not help you much. If you are struggling you can go to [...] to get step by step help with odd number problems but beware because these solutions skip simplification steps a lot of the time."
1,current Calculus Student,"The concepts in this book are very difficult to grasp. It provides easy examples, which do not help in the more difficult problems. The book does not explain concepts, but rather gives you formulas to plug numbers into. Hopefully you will have a good teacher to explain the concepts."
3,Marked vs Unnmarked Trails,"Beware: The author has not indicated the quality of markings within these trails. On my wife's and my first outing we chose an EASY trail. The 'trail' was no more than single track, overgrown, and after 2 miles we were lost. We finally hitchhiked back to the start along 4 miles of highway (thank God we found that --- there had been evidence of bears!). Although trail maintenance is not the author's responsibility, the book may lead the uninitiated to believe it's a ""walk in the park""."
4,An Interesting Idea,"M. Chartier has written an intellectual, tightly argued work that has been greatly beneficial to my understanding of the revolution in France. His notion that the ideas of the Enlightenment influenced revolutionary thought indirectly through a ""demystification"" of the monarchy is very intriguing. This book did much to make me question some of my long-held presumptions about the French Revolution."
4,"Long and Dry, but good nonetheless","Ok, not the best book for this topic. For a better (and shorter) read, Try William Doyle's A Short Introduction, The French Revolution."
2,Too hard for me.,After I have read more about the French Revolution I will try to read the book again. I have read The Comming of the French Revolution by George Lefebvre and enjoyed it.
5,This is no coach potato,I thought this was a real scary book. It gave me GOOSEBUMPS!!!! I hope R.L. Stine writes more scary books like Horrors of the Black Ring was.
2,Huh?,"This book is split into two parts. Part One - creepy, intelligent and a mature Goosebumps setting that is scary and spine-tingly. Pare Two - What? So just completely ridiculous. This book goes downhill after the second part begins. This could have been a sophisticated and classic werewolf thriller, but it turns into a cheap short bad dream."
1,Crash and Burn,"This is a fun game-- I love it. But it crashes very 3 turns. I save the game every turn, every third turn it crashes, I load it and get three more turns. Who can play a game that way?"
3,Gets the job done,"I have been using the iGo everywhere130 model for about one month now and it has met my minimum expectations. It works from both AC and DC outlets as advertised. Unfortunately, it is not recognized by my Dell 9200 as a power supply with enough power to support full clock speed. My system always comes up in power saving mode when using the iGo. This is inconvenient as I had hoped to only have to carry this power supply for all uses. I still have to carry the Dell power brick for times when I need full speed out of my system."
2,Beware! Does not charge battery for a Dell Latitude D610,"In the fine print on the hang tag (which I only saw after I purchased the item) it says that it will only power a Latitude D610; it will not charge the battery. Useless as far as I am concerned as that was one of the main things I needed it to do. Also, with all the tips for powering a second device, I was dismayed NOT to find one for my Palm Treo 700. So the two things I bought it for: charging the D610's battery and at the same time charge my Treo, it doesn't do. I'm sending it back. Oh ... and the main power unit is very heavy. Nicely designed, but heavy."
2,Essentially useless for Dell D-Series notebook,"The supplied S20 tip for Dell is ""Power Only"", will not charge the battery. iGo's support blog says it's due to a business agreement with Dell. Dell sells it's own OEM version of the iGo (which is crippled in a different way).I wanted to use this as a replacement for 4 adapters I carry in my laptop bag. The iGo adapter cannot replace your Dell adapter on a business trip. Very disappointing. Partially Dell's fault, I guess, but I'm not inclined to buy anything else from iGo after my assessment of this model."
2,"Okay, not great","I bought the Igo because it was on sale for the same price as the standard adapter for my computer (HP DV1000t) but came with so much more. The power supply is great and the tips work alright, but the multiple connections and cords means that something is *always* coming unplugged. And today, barely a month after I bought it, the cable connecting my computer to the power brick broke. (The head which goes into the brick separated from the cable; it appears irreperable.) Hopefully the replacement cord will work better, but overall I'd recommend getting something less bulky."
2,Brick OK. Tips? Not so much...,"I've had two or three of these over the years for powering several Mac laptops. While theyhave worked generally OK, I've had REPEATED occurrences of the tips breaking off insidemy computers power port. I was lucky a couple of times and the remaining piece of thetip just fell out, but a couple of other times I had to replace the DC-in card (not cheap) sincethe broken tip was lodged in there. I've never had that happen with an EOM charger fromApple, though their units have problems of their own (mostly weak, arcing-prone cables)So, from my perspective, the potential (initial) savings was completely obliterated once thetips broke off. I'm not a fan and would not buy another iGo product.By the way, the breakage was not due to abuse. The very ends of these tips just seem toweaken over time. Whether that's due to repeated heating and cooling cycles, or just baddesign or manufacture, I don't know."
4,For Dell iGo Everywhere85,"Dell's don't charge with this iGo, but that's Dell's fault, not iGo. It does power the laptop, just don't unplug it or you will not be any more charged than when you started. However, after 2 years of use my everywhere130 died and I loved it enough to buy another. I ended up with the everywhere85 and low and behold it does charge my Inspiron 6000, which the 130 did not. It is also smaller and less bulky. I think the 130 is a great product, I loved it enough to lug it around the world instead of my cell phone, camera, iPod and other charges. I'm just happy to finally not have to also take a seperate charger for my laptop."
1,Don't buy - computer runs slower - doesn't charge battery,I bought this for a Dell Vostro. I get a nasty little error message about the computer running slow and not charging the battery.
1,Junk,I've had this thing for 3 months now and it is already dead. When you spend $120+ dollars on something it shouldn't be this bad. it is light but thats all it has going for it.
1,Don't waste your time,"I bought the Juice a couple of years ago - it is no longer useable. The iGo website claims ""The only charger you need. Simply switch the tip.TM* iGo power tips work with any iGo charger for gadgets or theiGo dualpower accessory"" but the reality is that in a year they will find some reason to make you buy a new one for new devices. A waste of your time in my opinion."
5,Easy setup and it does it jobs well,"Bought this unit from Costco during 2011 X'mas and used it as UPS/Surge Protector for my TV and Home entertainment.Having 8 outlets is good for all the boxes needed.The UPS display is good and provide all informaiton needed. The good thing is that it can be turned off when not needed. Registration O/L is quick and easy.A few days ago, we had really bad thunder storm in the areas and power went yo-yo right when we were watching evening news. I notice the incandescent light went really bright for a second or two then dropped down to normal. I noticed this blew up the old bulb in my garage. But all my TV/Stereo/Cable box were fine - thanks to it's surge protector."
4,surge protection,"I owned a few of tripp lite UPS's They all have lasted beyond there life span. This one looks cool, but will the company keep up the quality-longevity? I have had my unit almost a month and it still smells like burning elctronics. I know this is normal for a few days with most electronics but my computer room still has the new electronics smell! I will let you know any changes."
1,Mine failed too!,"Consistent with several other postings here, my 2 year old Tripp Lite SMART 1000 recently started to randomly shut down too. This is the second Tripp Lite product that I've had this type of problem with (my A/V installer replaced the other one under warranty.) Will be looking for a different brand since these guys obviously have some problems...."
1,ITEM FAILED WITH LESS THAN ONE YEAR OF USE,"This UPS worked great until it developed a major problem. Every day, or every week, or every other week at a random time it will just shut off. No beeps, no warnings, no indications whatsoever of a problem. It just instantly shuts down! It will always turn back on when I press the power button, and then it's fine for a while until it decides to do it again. I will never purchase another Tripp Lite product again. The software that comes with Tripp Lite (PowerAlert Console) is not the best, but it does the job. Tripp Lite customer service is useless."
3,runs a bit too hot,"The power consumption measured by a power meter shows 15 watts at idle, which is while not 100 like others noted, but is still a bit too high considering that it does absolutely nothing at idle. This alone will consume $70 worth of electricity in 5 years, not mentioning the additional $100 in AC costs required to get the additional heat out of the room."
2,~60% failure rate.,"Of the 12 Tripp-Lite ups' I've purchased over the last two years, 7 have failed so far. While they have a good feature set, they just don't seem to hold up. They have a three-year warranty if you don't mind record keeping and shipping, but I'd prefer a better built unit."
1,"Worked for a year or so, non-repairable, buy another please","I have two of these, bought nearly at the same time. One is still working. One turns itself off intermittently and is worse than useless. I emailed customer support and they were very responsive, but told me simply that the unit was not supported and I should buy another - - they would provide one at a ""discount"". I paid over $100 for this thing and I don't expect to have to do that every couple of years. No sale."
2,Lasted two years for me....,"Purchased this model almost exactly two years ago. Died today for no apparent reason. The unit is completely unresponsive and has definitely had only light usage.....Not telling anyone not to buy it, but I expected longer than two years."
1,Bad Product,"I agree with a previous poster, that one star is not low enough.I have three of these devices. The first one started turning off and on randomly...The system was not overloaded, it's just that every three or four hours, it would just restart everything. So, my brand new computer would lose power, and restart at random intervals.So, I have another one, so I hooked THAT one up instead. That second one randomly, ""powers down,"" and shuts off various devices on the system, but not all of them. The computer stays on, while the monitor, cable modem, and router lose power. there's no way to ""power them back on,"" they just lose power.I will not buy this product, this name, nor any company of which it is a subsidiary, again."
1,More like Trip and Fall,It worked fine for 18 months then began to shut itself off intermittently. The LCD showed the battery charged to 100% capacity but any power variation would cause it to shut down. After a month of that agony it quit. The LCD display still shows that the battery is 100% charged but the battery powered output has 0 volts. The surge protected side (no backup is at 120 V). What happened to the old dependable UPS's that worked for ever? This was a complete waste of money in my opinion.
1,Just cut off...,My 2 year old TrippLite Smart 1000LCD has begun to randomly cut off...completely...without warning. It has done ok since I bought it until now. From other 1 star reviews it looks like I'm not alone. For a backup to cost over $100 you would think it would last longer. Would not buy TrippLite again.
1,Self Power Off. Computer Killer.,"This is the worst UPS in the history of mankind. I used it for three years and it turned itself off suddenly. Protection of computer: No. Kill the server: Possible. If there is a zero star, it deserves the rating shamefully."
