3,Hard to reuse,"This product worked the first time, but the adhesive backing was worn after one use and I tried to preserve using wax paper but that didn't work as planned."
1,thought this was the real movie,thought this was the real movie. my daughter and I were very disappointed. bummer. i guess i'll have to go buy the actual movie.
5,to the guy asking the hair question,"i think the tree is grabbing it, and she is trying to free herself by cutting off the hair the tree is holding/entangling, whatever.oh, and the book is good, too."
2,repackaging,"This and part 1 is merely repackaging of the 1st hard-bound book [Eye of the World]. The advertisment reads as if it is a prequel. Wrong. The publisher just figured another way to make a few more dollars. The Eye of the World and all of the remaining books of ""The Wheel of Time"" are outstanding. They didn't need / require this treatment!"
3,"Duplicate book, sort of","Don't buy this book if you already have the Book One, The Eye of the World. It really is just the last part of the Book One. The type is larger but it was a waste of money and time for us. Upon reading it, everything sounded very familiar (even after reading *all* the available books in the series) and upon a little research, it is a duplicate. Strange that there isn't a first half of Book One. Why did the publisher do this?"
1,It was fun the first 11 times...,"Many, many years ago I received 'The Eye of the World' for Xmas. Within days I became immersed in a world of magic, myrdraal, ogres and the dark one.Then 12 books later I just got sick of it all. I mean how many times do I want to hear about the embroidery on Nynaeve or Elayne's dresses?I love this book, but its like crack. If you haven't started it all ready, don't start now."
5,read tv,"I work with children of the age 0-6 years teaching literacyI work with children who may have barriers and be at a low literacy levelI am thrilled to see educational videos on early literacyThis video or dvd is colorfull and funThe events are nurturing and humorous about everyday children and life activitiesMy favorite thing about Read TV is the calming environment and appealing tones of all the charactersThis is very important for children who may have fasd / faseThe pace and transition of the stories very well plannedEvery child will love Read TV and be able to identify withsimple childhood pleasuresI have it in my collection and I love it so much thatwe presented a video to our community ROOTS OF EMPATHY BABIES this year who pioneered the program in our schools for the first timeREAD TV captures the connection of milestones , meaning and language development for early childhood developmentYeah!!!! I look forward to more"
2,I didn't like it ?,I know this got great reviews but I found it to be sort of budget looking or in other words with cheep filming. My dtr. was not attracted to it at all. Sorry :-(
5,Inspiring Story For Readers Of All Ages,"Love Knows No Distance is a story from a time that will be forgotten in the near future. The story from depression-era Alabama during the 20th century should be told to all of our children. Family love and devotion and faith in God for survival is a tradition our society is loosing. The traditional values in this story make it uplifting. The author's humor is refreshing but the element of love expressed in her book heart wrenching. I laughed and cried as I read her powerful story and I could not lay this book down until I finished reading the story. To paraphrase from the book ....""the only kind of blindness that's a real handicap is the kind of blindness that keeps you away from God."" If you know anyone who is suffering through an illness or disability I would highly recommend this book as a gift. Every church library needs a copy also."
2,don't buy,this is just a real pain to use and not comfortable. I already upgraded to the Polar CS300. Gave this to my kids as a toy because that's what it is.
5,Great product,"I bought it for me, but my daugther used and she love it. Of course I gave it to her. It great! good product. Heart rate is accurate. Keep me inspirate during workout."
5,A festival it is,"Ot Azoj keeps growing! When will they play in america? A good band like this shoudn't be kept for the europeans only!This cd is a nice mixture between old and new, happy and sad.It's the best chanukah cd I ever heard!I'm very curious about their next cd. I saw it on their website... It's called Klezmer fon Kishinev. Should be interesting. I hope Amazon will have it soon!Ot Azoj keep up the good work!Ben Levi"
4,Elan Barenholtz is one of the leading singers on the jewish,The festival of Lights album includes a song by elan barenholtz (Haneiros- 1st track)who is the premeir jewish singer/songwriter around today. A definite must buy!!! He visited Penn and made quite a splash.
5,Highly Recommended for your Hag Simayach,"Last year we purchased the Erran Barron Cohen Songs in the Key of hannukah download the best contemporay Channukah album we have heard in years of searching for festival music. This album while traditional yiddish music is fresh and equally exciting, very soulful and just right for the holiday. It will make you reminice about Zede & Bube and break dance at the time. The music tradition while being current and fresh at the same time. It make you want to celebrate!"
4,They're good and getting better,"Really fine klezmer band. They get better with each cd. Check out their web site at otazoj.com. I'd highly recommend this cd as a gift. The production values are o.k. As a previous reviewer noted, the liner notes aren't so hot. But the music is awesome."
4,Good Toaster Oven,"This is a good toaster oven for the price! It is a little bit on the small size, but overall I'm very happy w/it."
3,Good product for the price,"I got this toaster-oven for 5 bucks, since I used free shipping and a $25 gift certificate. That said, even if I had to pay in full this toaster is still worth its full price.It's great, quick and easy to clean. There's a led that tells you when your stuff is done so I don't understand other people's bad reviews. The door opens and closes perfectly.The only thing is that the top wall becomes extremely hot. Being that I used cold-wall toaster all my life, it's the only thing that bothers me. Overall a great quality/price ratio."
1,Horrible,"Previous to buying this I had a toaster oven for 5 years. I bought this after some minor research but felt comfortable with the brand. I used this mostly for toast and after a month the door was not closing properly and required me to hold down the base to open. After six months it got to the point that the door wouldn't even close, I called the company and they refused to replace it and would only fix it if I paid for it. A true piece of junk."
1,piece of junk,"First off, you would need to find very small bread to fit 4 pieces of bread in this thing. After a short amount of use, the temperature knob broke off. The door handle nearly broke off. The door had problems closing and eventually needed to be propped closed with a heavy object in order to toast even somewhat efficiently. Spend a little more and get a unit that will last and possibly actually fit more than 2 pieces of toast."
4,Needed a Toaster Oven,"I read some of the reviews and I thought, maybe I shouldn't buy this one. I have bought 2 Black & Decker toaster ovens for my grown daughters 7 or 8 years ago and they liked and used them with no problems. I purchased this one about a month ago. The oven works perfect. The door works fine. I broiled, baked and toasted different items and they came out great. If you are considering this don't hesitate. Not a bad price at all for 29.99 and there wasn't any shipping charges. Other places are higher. I know I shopped around."
1,Should have looked here first,"I didn't buy this on Amazon, but I see that everyone else bought the same one I did. I should have checked here first, at the very least. My parents had a great little toaster oven for years, it was all grimy and black inside, but it worked perfectly. Then they got a new shiny one (crappy) and gave me their old one. But now being 3000 miles away and in need of a new one, I forgot the lessons of my past, and bought a random cheap toaster oven (this one). Like everyone else said, there's no notice of toast finishing. Bells are how expensive? The thing heats up to a ridiculous degree. I'm sure if I ever spaced out and set something paper on top I'd burn my house down. The tray? It warps every single time I use it. Doesn't seem to have affected my food, but it's freaky to see two of the corners pointed up almost up to the little roof. I guess actual metal is too expensive too.How I pine for the toaster oven of my youth..."
1,Cheap price for cheap junk,"The oven is less than what you pay for. The old/prior cabinet type was was good whch they no long manufacture. Anyway, it heats very slowly especially when making toast. The temperature knob is extremely hard to turn and poorly designed as to get a grip on it. Seriously consider researching and purchasing another brand. This product is a good example you get less than you pay for...save you money and do the right thing!"
2,toaster oven review,I am not too pleased with the way the door opens and closes it sticks every time I open it. Making it hard to open. Otherwise it works fine.
4,The Price,"Price can't be beat..Like any applience, it has to be watched while it is working,but I do like it..I use it for toasting sandwiches, frozen pizza ,toast...."
4,"A ""Hot"" Deal","This toaster oven is a great buy. Does the job well, with basic procedures. Good size, not too big as so many are now. The only complant I have is that it gets a bit hot. I don't think it is dangerous, just very hot to the touch when in operation. Make sure that you have lots of space around it and your kids don't touch it when in use."
3,This toaster has no bell,"I recently bought this toaster to replace another B&D; that I had for close to 15 years. I don't think this one will last as long--it seems less rugged and the toaster button is one of the push-in types that seems likely to fail sooner rather than later. Other than that, it seems fine for the price.Just one thing--in spite of what it says in the product description, there is no bell on this toaster. You pretty much have to watch it to know when the toast is done."
2,not good for this price,"This is a decent looking toaster but does not have 50 dollar performance. It toasts very unevenly, even burning parts of the waffle or bread. You can work around this by babysitting your food but that is not what I wanted in toaster oven that is this expensive. I would be totally fine with it's performance had I only spent $20 on it. I returned mine and bought a digital De'Longhi that is about $65 dollars list price. It has the same problem! I'm considering buying a regular toaster and just using my big oven for heating sandwiches etc."
4,Workhorse,"We purchased this toaster for our office of about 60 people. It gets tons of use every day and we've had no problems with it so far. As other reviewers have stated, it has no bell indicating that it is done. I really didn't see this as a major issue since it shuts off automatically when it has reach the level of toasting it was set to. Overall we have been very happy with this purchase. I gave this four stars only because the bottom doesn't come completely out (it simple opens halfway to allow you to dump the crumbs). Therefore, the whole machine needs to be carried over to the trash and emptied."
5,Toaster Oven is doing its job as expected!,I bought this for my elderly mother's use. She's happy with it. It's easy to use. Not too big. Doesn't take up much room. Works appropriately. Is made well too.
1,The worst kitchen appliance I've owned,The oven does not ding when it turns off. The oven door frequently jams so that it's difficult to open and close. The wires on the wire rack are so far apart that relatively large pieces of toast often fall between the wires. (They're quite difficult to retrieve.) The housing is mostly conductive metal so it's very easy to burn yourself.How hard is it to design a toaster oven? We continue to be amazed at what a lousy piece of equipment this is.I used to like Black & Decker appliances. You've been warned.
2,Toasts Evenly otherwise forget it,It toasts two pieces of bread evenly. Its called a 4-slice toaster oven. I think its impossible to get 4 slices of bread in this product. I toast two and while eating them toast the other two.The broiler knob broke off within a year. No bell so you have to be alert.
1,dont buy this,This is the worst stick to the old classic one. I got this and everyone hates it. The rack has two levels No matter what level you use Its either burnt on one side raw on the other. Or burnt on both side. Just awful. Pretty chome looking but works terrible.
1,Not as advertised,Product has been returned and acknowledged. Product did not have the feature advertised that was most important item to us - namely a removable crumb tray.
2,Can't toast with it,"This oven cannot seem to comprehend ""toast"". It seems that once it reaches a certain temperature, it just shuts off the heating elements. It doesn't matter whether the item is toasted or not. Sometimes, it turns back on in mid stride. Either this is a think-of-the-children type of safety feature or a defect. Regardless, it is going back to the store."
1,extremely dangerous piece of junk,"I was in the kitchen and the piece of bread I put in to toast blew up in flames. This item is made very cheaply. Why would they even make a toaster oven where there is no indication or bell when the toasting is complete? Or else a safety feature that turns itself off if it overheats?I agree with the other reviews that it is nearly impossible to open or close without reaching in and moving the rack and the tray doesn't come out very far.When I turned it on the entire chrome top of the oven became dangerously hot. Even 5 minutes after it's done and turned off, I still couldn't leave it alone and I would never ever have my kids use it.I've had a black & toaster before for sixteen years without any problems that worked great. This one cooks much too fast and burns the food and in my situation almost my kitchen. I am sure I got a defective one."
1,"No bell, door impossible to open/close","What more can I say - there is no indication when the toasting is complete, and it is nearly impossible to open or close without reaching in and (ouch) moving the rack a bit.What junk!"
3,Am I the only one who thinks this could be dangerous??,"Pros:It does what I expect it to do.I had no problems opening the door or tray.Cons:The tray doesn't come out very far and if you're grabbing your toast by hand, then please DON'T! The entire chrome casing of the oven becomes untouchably hot. My knuckle grazed it once while I was grabbing some toast and I got burnt pretty badly considering the amount of contact I made. I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem, but even 5 minutes after it's done, I still can't touch the outside. It's ok now, but I have to make sure guests and kids don't use it."
1,i have the same problems,"I have difficulty opening and closing the door, no bell when toast cycle is complete, AND it takes several minutes to make a piece of toast! It seems like this was the result of a great effort to engineer the most aggravating toaster oven ever."
3,Toaster oven,"I've had a black & toaster before similar to this one that worked great as an oven but this one tends to cook to fast and burns the food so you cant turn it on over 150 degrees. I probably got a defective one. But for the price its a great toaster and thats what I mainly bought it for. I hate regular toasters because even if you get the wide ones, bagels and waffles just never seem to fight right. With a toaster oven you can use it for these and a lot more. And by the way who needs a bell to know if its done, just look at it and pull it out. ( it also has a little light that will turn off when its done)"
5,Nice dish!,"I've used this baking dish for quite a while and have been very happy with it. Nice size, easy clean up, good quality at a fair price. What more could I want?"
1,Broken dish after being in the freezer,"After I had frozen a mixture in a gratin dish , I placed the dish on a cloth covered wooden table. When I went to serve the contents I noticed a complete split down the middle of the dish. The instructions did say that the dish can be placed in the freezer. Have written to the company so we shall see what happens."
3,Le Creuset,"This dish cleaned up very well after its first use. While I was using it the second time, it broke in the oven while using the broiler. Customer service was very accommodating though, and is sending another in the mail (you have to mail them the broken pieces)."
5,Great quality and size.,"This item is a great size and quality. It worked really well for my holiday meals. I would not hesitate to buy more of it in the future.In ref to one of the bad reviews about shipping, I've ordered other pieces of this line, and they arrived in tact, no breaking whatsoever. That person must have gotten the back luck of a packer who just did not care, just wanted to get it out fast."
5,Awesome,"I have had the Pampered Chef Baker for years and always loved it, so when I received a gc to Amazon I thought I'd give this a go. I LOVE this pan. Unlike the PC pan, I can put this in the dishwasher, and it cleans up so nice. It's larger than I thought (Since traditionally Le Creuset items are on the small side). The color is beautiful and I love the gradient from dark to light.I highly recommend this baking dish and I plan on buy other sizes in this set."
5,Understand how you need to think and act to be healthy.,"This book is my comphrehensive guide to being healthy in mind/body/spirit. After reading it I understood what to do to be healthy, and had a deeper understanding of why I should really want to be healthy."
5,Free yourself - removing the limits we put on ourselves,Simple messages that are life changing if you are ready for it!!
5,Making Health Easy!,"Anyone would benefit from reading this book, and would have a great time doing so! Dr. Jamie's unique writing style makes it fell like he is right there with you, talking you through an easy to understand path to great health. It's fun, and has already made a great difference in my life!"
5,Fabulous CD,"We are most pleased with this purchase, but ten words are a minimum requirement to submit this form and I have nothing more to say."
5,Great Music Beautifully Presented.,"Bill and Gloria Gaither and Their Homecoming Friends: Amazing Grace is a video that can be enjoyed repeatedly and shared with friends who enjoy music. It is wonderful, especially the song I THEN SHALL LIVE sung by the Gaither Vocal Band and Ernie Hasse & Signature Sound."
5,The most beautiful NEW hymn ever,"The next to the last song on this DVD is one written by Bill Gaither, and the lyrics are by his wife Gloria. ""SO I Shall Live."" It is exquisitely beautiful, both in music and in what it says. There aren't many new hymns any more, but this song is one that should become an all-time favorite. It, and Mark Lowrey's ""Mary Did You Know"" have to be the best additions in Christian music to capture faith thru music."
2,"too much poesie, too little photographique","Personally, I had great expectations; was very disappointed to see such a limited selection of his work. A total of 150 photographs doesn't cover much when it amounts to limited highlights of his various themes, the selections themselves questionable (I should have taken note when the Editorial said that many of the pics hadn't been published before). Buy this used as a remainder in two years for $10."
1,Can't find any people to be a companion!,"I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas. He tried for hours to find a companion in the game to take with him on the trail, and no people appear (except the ones that work in the shops). I tried it to, and I can't find anyone, so we can't even get started on playing the game! It's frustrating for both of us."
4,Oregon Trail 4,I have never used the previous versions of Oregon Trail. After reading so many negative reviews I feel I have to speak up. I am a 3rd grade teacher and I can say in a few simple words that my students love this game. It helps them think and make decisions. We have 20 copies of this game in a computer lab and none have had technical difficulties.
2,fun at first,"when i first got oregon trail 4, i was really excited! i got my dad to install it right away! i had a lot of fun for a few days, but then all of a sudden it quit working! now all it does is plays the sounds- no picture! i wouldnt buy this product- i wouldnt take it if someone gave it to me! it would be fun if it worked."
4,Love it,"I had no problems with the Program. My kids and I enjoy it It crashed once but we had saved the game and just started it back up where we had saved it. As with any game I recomend you save the game as you make it past milestones. My son enjoyed hunting and my daughter enjoyed the wild rides down the mountain sides. ""Its like a roller coaster"" she said.We have a pentuim 2 processor and great graphics package. The program worked great on our computer."
2,Well...,"It worked at first, no errors or anything and I enjoyed it. But, when it came time to reboot my computer, the game completely failed! I got as far as the town, and then all the people disappeared. I couldnt form a wagon or even join one, and it was frustrating! Same thing happened with number three!"
1,Very disappointing,"We never could get it up and running for very long, despite having a technical whiz in the family. We could not get any telephone help from the manufacturer, and the online help was skimpy. I would like to have a working product for my children, but am hesitant to buy any more Oregon Trail Products."
4,a good game,"This is a good educational game for kids. I was somewhat disappointed to discover the relatively slow gameplay and a game engine plagued with bugs and errors. Gameplay is easy enough to understand and despite some technical flaws, will provide endless hours of enjoyment for the children."
4,I love this game,I got this game for baby-sitting we loaded it on and the people did not work. We got with the technical support and they told us to got to broderbrund.com they told us how to get the people to work the only thing the didn't tell us was to totally delete the game when you are done with the process. Most people don't like this game true Oregon Trail 2 was the best yet with lots more trails to go on and such. There is some difficulties with this game but all in all it has only exited twice on me. It probably is just the peoples computer. Note the disapering people usally only happen with Windows. I also think that you should read the box that's says 10! and up seven year olds should not play this game enless they know the reason people got those illness's. This game is very educational and great for older kids.
2,Not Compatible--I hope 5 is,"You need a stone age Quick Time that is no longer in use to get it to work! Also, it is not a very stable program. It is too bad, because it is pretty cool. You can learn a lot from it."
1,Oregon Trail 4 - not what you would expect,"I do not recommend buying this game. The first one I bought loaded fine, but I could never move out of first gear. There were no people in the hotel and I could not join a wagon or advance. All the double clicking in the world would not get this game to work. I exchanged the game for another and the exact same senario occured. Bad batch of CD? I think so. Buy the way, the first and second editions of this software are the best. The third edition keeps crashing on the 3rd CD. The Learning Company needs to get their act together."
1,Frustrating Beyond Belief,"This game was extremely frustrating. As one reviewer pointed out, you must switch between Quick Time 4 and 3 to be able to begin to use the game. Furthermore, even after doing that, I had additional problems with DirectX. After hours of communication with The Learning Company to resolve these problems (unless everything is set up perfectly, there is no way to find companions to start the game), TLC simply refered me to the manufacturer of my computer. Extraordinarily poor design and follow-through. My computer is a relatively new HP 4445 that far exceeds the recommended needs to run this game, yet nothing works.Simply put, do not buy this game unless your idea of family fun and education consists of repeated and futile exchanges with the consumer service division of The Learning Company."
1,I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I repeat...!,"Okay, Okay, This game may look so fun, but it isn't so fun. I started playing this and it was okay, but then when I went on the voyage/trip to Oregon, it was boring! Nothing to really do and then the game started to mess up...like half of the screen went black. This game is so different than Oregon Trail 3(and not in a good way). I reccomend Oregon Trail 3 instead of this piece of junk."
1,oregon trails fourth ed.,"The first CD works fine. But the second will not load, and it is frustrating. We enjoy the oregon trails II and use it daily in the detention center I work for in AZ. We received only half the value of the product we paided for. A big let down. Take them off the shelves in the stores."
1,Technical difficulties ruin the fun,We excahnged our first copy of this game because it kept freezing the computer when we put in the second disk. The new disk has the same problems and we've never gotten beyond the first disk. The kids have stopped trying and I'm sorry that I did not ask for a full refund. I thought we were doing something wrong until I read the other reviews and see that many people have had the same problem. Big dissapointment:-(
1,Watch out!,My daughter is seven and was extremely disturbed by this software. She stopped eating (thought she was going to catch Cholera) and is still having trouble with her food.Please be careful!
4,Pretty Dress,"This is a really pretty dress. It fit our daughter well and looked great on her. I'm on a calibrated monitor and the color pink shown is not true to the dress we received. It is a much softer pink that looks even better. As with most things pink, our four year old daughter absolutely loves the dress which is exactly what we were looking for."
5,adorable easy care dresses,"My daughters, 9 and 11, looked very pretty in these dresses at their big friend's wedding. We had to order a bigger size (12 instead of 10 for both)even though they had measurements for size 10. I heard that another junior bridesmaid had the same problem with that dress. I suggest you buy one size bigger to be on the safe side. The dresses are beautiful, and the customer service is very prompt and cooperative. The fabric is easy to care for (cold water hand wash, line dry), stains wash off in seconds."
2,Book review,"The book lists many events of former or present dealers. However, the book fails to identify the various phrases used throughout. There is a glosery at the end, but you may not find it until you finish the book. There is much repetition."
2,Talented author without heart,"Though the writer is obviously gifted, and the stories are without a doubt amusing and accurately detailed, the author seems distant from his characters.The author seems to stay un-involved and to coldly inspect his subjects as though they were fireflies in Mason jars, or butterflies on pins.The writing is superb, but the lack of involvment in the characters inner workings and lives, leaves these stories sounding like a girlfriend repeating a soap opera in the office, to someone who missed an episode.I'll lay off with these last words. The author should look into his own heart and write real, breathing characters, not try to bring to life cardboard cutouts. No matter how excellent it is, it must heart. This book does not have heart, though it does have plenty of good writing."
5,"Wonderful, especially if you speak French","I wish I spoke French! This recording captures the full presentation of this Molierian play, music AND spoken word. The music is wonderful, and the singing is very accomplished; but unfortunately for me, the spoken parts are not confined to separate tracks but are intermixed with the music. So in order to hear all of the music, I had to also survive listening to the spoken parley which obviously sounded like ""bar-bar-bar"" to me. To be sure, the wonderful booklet includes all of the translation, as well as pictures from the staged production of the play. But it's not the same. Still, before I close I want to highlight the quality of the music and the brilliant presentation of it here. Even if you don't speak French, it probably justifies the purchase of this CD. Dominique Visse, in the comical role of an old lady, is particularly memorable."
4,Delightful SF Discoveries,"I've lived in SF for 6 years and have often wondered about some of the unique homes and buildings I see. Unfortunately, historical plaques on structures are rare. Consider this book as containing the historical plaque for each building.This book has great photos and succint descriptions, which I appreciate. I didn't pick up this book to read an in-depth history of SF, but simply to learn tidbits about each interesting structure. In the age of the internet, I can use the building's title or home's address to search for more information if I'm intrigued enough to do so. However, I much prefer this broad range of interesting landmarks with a paragraph or two about each.My only complaint about this book is that the order is by landmark number, whereas it would be more useful grouped by neighborhood. In any case, you can quickly create a walking tour for yourself based on this book."
1,All sizzle--no steak,"Despite the attractive photographs, the book is disappointing in that the writer apparently did no original research and simply dumped the City Planning Department's own files for each structure onto each page. The resulting content is little more than expanded captions. These historic resources deserved better."
1,one is too many stars..,"I rated this book with one star .Too little medical and scientific info, stupid tips...,as the size of the book shows; this lady has not much to say or much help to offer. There is much more to infertility than a few herbs and vitamins.You get better books for just a few $'s more ( "" the couple's guide to fertility"" or "" taking charge of your fertility"" )Don't bother with this !"
1,Recommends ADOPTION as a way to get pregnant.,"I'm not joking. In her chapter on miscellaneous tips she comments that so many people seem to get pregnant after adopting that you should consider this route. For the record - and this stat is NOT mentioned in her book - 5% of couples who end treatment will end up conceiving on their own *regardless of whether they choose adoption or not.*The rest of the stuff she mentions (herbs, vitamins, etc.) seemed like it was all gleaned from the internet and is presented without any detail.Skip this book!"
4,No More Walls,I would recommend this cd and I give it a 4 star rating. The music and singing are very inspiring.
2,Not shipped properly,"This item was shipped in a box smaller than the volleyball itself, so it got smashed during transit and arrived deflated. It would not reinflate otherwise for an extended time. The ball itself is cute, but not like an authentic volleyball, more like a plastic version. In other words, if you are buying this for a small child to play around with, it's probably okay, assuming they ship it correctly. For an avid volleyball player, this is not the item for you. To be fair, this was my first return, and it was exceptionally customer service friendly and easy, and I was very pleased."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This book is just a collection of cribbed inspirational speeches you could find from any coach before a high school sports event or from a support group therapy pamphlet. It's full of banal platitudes and generic rah-rah that doesn't show or tell you how to manage transitions in the personal and professional world.A poor read, indeed."
5,Success is a matter of steps - not just time.,"If you don't take the right basic steps - all the time in the world is irrelevant, your foundation will be shakey, and it's virtually impossible to stay successful and keep growing. Let the Cappinnelli's ""Say Yes To Change"" help you focus on basic-step tune ups so that life changes consistently empower and motivate you to new levels. No matter how successful you are in life, you deserve more so you can become more and give back more to the world. Muhammad Ali once said, ""Service is the rent I pay for my little room here on earth."" Serve yourself first by picking up the book and doing the simple yet elegant exercises and you'll find yourself changed about how you deal with change.

4,Interesting read,"There are many books filled with drills or that give you the best kept secret in golf, and so forth. Most of them are full of good intentions. This is not one of those books. It is an interesting way to look at your golf game. One of its main ideas is that this is a game and you should have a curiousity about how you play. If you are looking for a book that gives you physical drills and five chapters on how to swing a golf club this is not that book. If you are looking for a book on how to relax and accept and enjoy this frustrating game, then buy this one now."
2,So my swing is bad because of my mother?,"A lot of psyco-babble here. The book delves into psychiatric concepts that might be a little too deep for the average golfer to wade through.The major problem with this book is the writing. Apparently they tried to write it themselves. Two words: Ghost writer. They deperately needed one. It's disorganized and repeats itself frequently, but somehow never really brings the point across effectively.I was excited about this book at first, but it's very difficult to stick with and get through. If you have every other book out there on golf, buy it. Otherwise you may want to pass."
3,Very Cursory Review of WWII's Major Aircraft,"If you are looking for a very cursory review of WWII's major aircraft (i.e., a page or two for each aircraft) this is the book for you. If you are a modeler interested in paint schemas for an aircraft you are building it is also good in that good ones are provided. If you are looking for anything more, however, forget it. The book does not cover less well known aircraft. In addition, no information is provided on strategies of the major airpowers, history of the airwar (i.e., battles, growing strengths and weaknesses of nations' airforces over time, etc.), personnel or any other matter."
5,great ww2 book,"this book has such great detail to ww2 airplanes. its got multiple pictures of each plane with some b & w pics that are original. it has great info on them. it has detailed info on what they were like, how fast they could go, what they had for weapons etc. it also compares to the plane on that page to 2 other planes that compete with it. for example, an American plane being compared to 2 British planes. any way, if you are a ww2 airplane buff, this is a must have book."
5,Enjoy this series,"I own three of his other Aviation Factfile books, on Cold War aircraft, Experimental and Modern Military Aircraft. This provides details and stats that are interesting."
1,Cheaply made,"This brush would not stand up to a cast iron pan on its best day. In reality it looks very different from the picture shown, where the the bristles look short and very sturdy. Actually, the inner circle bristles are pliable plastic, the outer steel bristles are very thin and bend easily. Upon opening the package, several bristles had already bent backwards just during shipping. I would return the item, but it's subject to a 15% restocking fee and I would have to pay for shipping; not exactly worth it for an $8 item. Just disappointing."
3,Wagnerian Fairy Tale,"I've never really been able to get into this opera. It should be charming, and there are many parts that are charming. The Fourteen Angels pantomime is sublime as are a few other parts of the opera. But I've always found the Wagnerianisms overblown and at odds with the sing-song nature of the libretto. Even though the subject matter should make this opera a natural to introduce opera to children, I find that it really doesn't hold their attention the way Flute or L'Enfante Sortilege or even Turandot would.That being said, this is a good performance of the work. It is well conducted, with a good sense of pacing, and the singing is Wagnerian, but not too overbearing. I think this one is best heard on a highlights album though. There's just not enough good music to keep the attention for the entire two act opera."
4,Good,This is tres 1st cd. Its a good first effort. He has a lot of nice songs on it. It has a raw underground sound to it.
3,Really good underground cd.,It's a good cd but before i actualy bought it. with such few songs on there I'd have to listen to all of them first.
4,Got to be ready for FAllOut 3,"excellent product to take a memory trip, OR TO GET TO KNOW THIS excellent saga"
2,Where are the patches?,"Fallout and Fallout 2 are awesome. Fallout Tactics is also a good game. But how can a company justify releasing decade old games without including the updated patches? That is just completely unacceptable, especially when not only have these patches been out for years, but the bugs left in the games are very substantial. Pathetic."
1,Not what I expected,Not a very good game. I don;t recommend it. Plays slow and not enjoyable.Do waste your money.
3,How to solve install problems,"Many of us have had problems installing Fallout 2. I managed to fix the problem by opening up the DVD and going to the ""Bonuses"" folder then the ""patches"" folder, where I found a ""Read me"" file which explained that the master.dat or critter.dat files were a possible cause.I manually deleted the master.dat FOLLDER from the Fallout 2 folder on my hard disk, then dragged the master.dat FILE from the DVD into the Fallout 2 folder on my hard disk.This seemed to do the trick.Good luck."
4,Stands the Test of Time,"I have played all 3 games in the FallOut series and wish there would be a fourth. The first two are superior, as the previous reviewer noted, for the freedom they provide the player (though, if i recall correctly) in FallOut 1 you have a limited amount of time to complete the first parts of the game or you die of radiation poisoning or something.FallOut Tactics was a bit of a let-down from the first two, but none-the-less a very playable game and some very clever nods to late 90's, early 00's culture. (For example, there's a random encounter based on the movie ""Pitch Black"" and later you can hire a mercenary named Riddick who is very proficient at hand-to-hand combat.I know whether these games will work with Microsoft XP."
1,"Great game, Bad Edition","I love Fallout, and own it way too many forms, but this one is not good. The extra features, while nice but trivial, don't make up for the worst thing about this edition: It's censored. Most European versions were, and while most of the stuff is not that big of a deal, it's still not the full game."
2,"The clunky, slow interface ruined it for me","OK, I understand this is an old game, but I'm an old gamer - all the way back to the days of ASCII graphics, for goodness' sake. Fallout is a bit ugly even for 1997, but acceptable. The interface, however, is horrible. You constantly have to have to right click to change the cursor type, and then left click or left click and hold to select from a menu. I found it very awkward, though I did get more proficient after a few hours. But then the game moves sooo slowly - it seems to take forever just for you to walk from one place to another. I found that turning on the autorun and speeding up the combat helped, but the turn-based combat is still slow.Supposedly there's a good RPG behind this interface, but I don't have the patience. My advice to anyone thinking of buying this game: make sure you download and try the demo first! I didn't - I didn't even realize there was a demo available and bought the game on its reputation alone."
3,Saw this after Hail the Conquering Hero & immediately,"saw where the pattern of Sturges movies began. Take a good solid concept, in this case, political corruption, write a good script around it & satirizes. This formula can work for a long time if you don't take it too seriously & become preachy. Stuges doesn't, he makes it entertaining & funny in the style of its time. Briefly, in this case a bum, literally, thru cunning, intrique, shady dealings, & the help of stupid politicians rises to the heights of political power. It's your rags to riches to rags story. Some of the slapstick shtick is just silly, so I give it 31/2 stars instead of four."
1,Crap Crap Crap!!!!!!!!!,"This album is not worth my time to review but what the hell? All you people on here obviously don't know anything about talent. For one, this band is the worst live band on the face of the Earth. Secondly, this album is repetitive, boring, and you cannot understand one damn thing he says. He tries and fails miserably to imitate the legendary Mr. Cobain which is kinda hilarious to me. God, what else can I say? This is just down right trash except ""Let Me Out"" and ""House of Chains"" but even those songs get boring and annoying. A word to the wise, don't waste your hard earned money on this pile of steaming S**T. You have been warned!!"
4,Not a bad debut,"This is the Future Leaders of the World's first album 'LVL IV'. The first thing that caught my eye from this album was the enchanting historical artwork...the Roman Coptic symbol of Ordo Coptaos. The band concentrates on a rock formula with a tinge of grunge mixed in. It's not a bad effort for a debut release and I see more releases from this band of young men from Kansas.The three top songs of this album are 'Let Me Out', 'Unite' and 'Make You Believe'. The last 2 songs I disliked not because of the sound quality which had many riffs but the lyrics were distasteful, hence 4 stars only. Other than that the album rocked and fans of Nirvana, POM, Lost Prophets and 311 should like this band's offerings. Note: Distateful...their lyrics of anti government...I don't see the relevance of knocking one's country's government."
1,"More Nu-rock, same tired format...","Pubescent teens and rowdy frat houses from all around are sure to go nuts over this latest, Nu-Rowk gem!Turn on your radio...it's playing right now!Be sure to keep this album in your changer for the next college football pep rally. It'll jack you up!One star, I know, but it's a giant, gleaming star for the masterful marketing of these new, young and revolutionary talents!"
4,One of the best albums of 2005,"About summer of last year i got a new car, that car didnt come with a cd player so i was forced to listen to the radio for about a month. The best thing i got out of that was discovering this band. I heard Let me out on the radio and at first thought it was everclear. Then I found out it was some new band FLOW. I went out an bought the cd on the strengths of Let me out. And i was not dissapointed. Sure the cd isnt perfect, but it is theyre debut, so it doesnt have to be. It is very powerful and the singer has some very clever lyrics. My only problems with the cd are that it builds up with so much speed an anger, then will go to a slow song, builds back up, then goes to a slow song again. And the final two songs sound pretty similiar. But these are all forgivable mistakes for a new band. If your dissapointed with the lack of good bands out there right now, or fed up with the amount of Nickelback the radio plays, check these guys out."
2,do you like singles or albums?,"as a whole, i dont think this album is very good. the band is cool and has talent, but the whole album just isnt awesome. their vision of pretty much anti govt is present but the music isnt always there. the song everyday is what got me to buy the disk, and it is still one of the best songs in my collection. Everyday is easily the best song on the album. the other single, let me out, is also good. i usually dont like the singles as much as other songs from albums, but in this case the singles are the best songs."
3,"Not bad, but repeative","I picked up this album after surfing into the band's website and liking the bits available there. Overall, not a bad album and there is definitely talent present. My problem with the album is that as I cruise down the road, I am not sure when the song changes...the vocals and music seem to follow the same recipe for each song..except for the latter slower songs on the album, which should have been given a second thought in the first place.Overall, it is ok, there are couple of tracks worth having, but the CD itself isn't stellar."
3,Good For Its Brevity.,"A quick enjoyable read with fine artwork. The text jumps around and does not focus enough on the titles subject. Still it is a good book for begining students and wargamers. These various nomads were clearly an intriguing, tough, and deadly opponents to all who had the misfortune of battling them. Thankfully, they usually did not have the ability and tenacity for long sieges otherwise Civilization as we know it may have been wiped out."
5,From the People who help bring us the Dark Ages,"A solid book that tell us about some very tough and scary folks on horse back. (The Pope had a lot of guts staring down Atilla, who wanted to sack Rome.) Great Text in the space provided couple with some wonderful pictures."
4,exctiing but kind of supeficial,"I like osprey books thoughit's a sortof short but always contains many useful text,maps, beautiful plates particulary MR.McBride's ones .this book explains well about history and thier influence to Western History nevertheless, can not provide high level of information. but anyway,it's worth readingand it probably helps you ."
4,"Silly, silly, silly!","This review first appeared in the ""Ephrata (PA) Review"".Dad's out of town for the day, and the dog comes downstairs dressed exactly like dad! Mom, brother and sister experience a highly unusual day. The dog acts like dad in many ways-""he woke up grouchy and demanded some grub""-but unlike him in others. He chased a cat, for example.Kids who like zany books will get a kick out of this silly work by two friends who were inspired to create it after realizing they had both dressed just like their dads that day."
5,Ready To Tell It Again,"I wrote this short story, as I am disable, but working. It's been 14 years since the accident, and my life changed forever. Without words to match the feelings, words are the tool's of thought's and believing that I can do it."
3,Not too impressed...,"I am not going to totally put this pan down, but I am just not too impressed by it. It is a cheap pan, and it cooks like a cheap pan - the lid fits a pan I have that had no lid, so I am happy about that - but as for the actual pan, it is thin, and the coating is thin, and stuff sticks to it, and it is not as easy to clean as most of my non stick pans - will I use it, sure I will, will I let my kids and husband, heck no, it's going to need to be babied for that coating to stay intact.It is a large pan, and that is it's best feature."
1,Not for glass tops,"This pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced. I have a number of Farberware pans that have served me well, but this one came out of the box warped. The first time I put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy, with only one strip through the center that made contact. I could return it, but for $10 it is not worth the argument with Amazon about restocking fees. So after one use it is now washed and packed up in the GoodWill box. I would never use it again."
2,Too big,"Unless you have a lot of cabinet space, this thing is just too big. I use it as a WOK it is so large. It seems to be cheaply made too."
4,not bad for the price,Not as thick and heavy as expected.. (didn't expect much for the price anyway)... but not bad overall... Should last atleast a year...For ppl who are not sure of its size.. its easily the largest pan in our home... as big as the huge wok.pal :)
3,A silver diamond in the rough?,"After navigating some basic flaws from being written by a first-time author and being a self-published work, I somehow still found this book entertaining. The story is fresh and the concept original. I've read plenty of fantasy books in my time and I've never heard of anything like Onyxdrop. Plus the characters were well-developed and the fighting scenes well-written, although at times some of the characters' actions seemed a little stilted or incongruous with their personality/background. The book does have major problems with editing, or lack thereof. It is distracting, and I hope that with the second book those problems will be ironed out.The author did do a good job of pacing the action in the book and keeping the reader's suspense. I'm sure as he gains more experience writing novels, each successive work will be more polished."
1,Oh Please!,"As an avid reader of fantasy (and many other genres), I find it hard to believe that any other well-read person would enjoy this book. The story is okay but underdeveloped. It wants to be epic (think Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, etc.) but doesn't quite have the stamina. It feels more like an outline than an actual novel. On top of that, the editing is extremely poor. I felt like I needed a red pen to make it through to the end! There are many, many mistakes (i.e. your/you're, duplicate words, too/to, etc.) that make for a bumpy read at best. The character development is lacking and much of the words are redundant within single paragraphs. I have no desire to expend either money or time in order to continue with this series."
3,The fit is very inconsistent,"I purchased this as I am an average 36C. When I got it, the material was pretty heavy and the cup area was huge, certainly not a C cup. Problem is the company will NOT let you return anything if the packaging is opened. Well how can one try something on without taking it out of the package?I found that out after I tried to return it.Now I am stuck with this pricey and heavy body suit that leaves wrinkles under my shirts, because my boobs are swimming in the cup area.I will never buy this brand ever again.If you decide to buy this learn from me... if you are a D cup buy a C cup, and so on."
1,VERY poor fit.,"I am short-waisted and this garmet is way too short for me. If you have the bra section where it needs to be to give you support, the bottom section rides up. If you pull the bottom down where it needs to be the bra is lower than it should be and the top part of you will fall out when you bend over. It was a huge waste of money and for the price I am very disappointed."
4,Briefer,"Nice briefer. Smooth, wire lays nice and stays well shaped. Have bought many of these in a variety of colors. One thing to note is you do need help getting it on."
1,"Unqualified Author, Unsubatantiated Claims","The author assumes simply following Jewish ritual will take care of parenting for you. Obviously, this theory holds no water. Secular advice on child rearing which actually approaches the topics of interaction with the rest of the world will be most beneficial to your children."
3,access 7,Provides an introductory hands-on course for first time users of Access 7 for Windows 95. Each of the basic features of Access 7 is introduced through a series of practical business exercises and activities.
5,Smooth Jazz Guitar At It's Very Best,"I've been a TR fan for years. This CD is an example of some of thefinest playing available. I love every track.I'm partial to Thom'selectric playing and he shines on this disc. The title track reminds me of Norman Brown, except Thom has been around a whole lotlonger. TR is a guitar player's guitarist.His credits/discographyare amazing.Most of the listening public probably never heard of TR, but anybody who really knows about smooth jazz guitar knows TR is a true ""MASTER""."
2,Not a moving song fest.,"I am a Gaither fan; I have dozens of their DVDs. This DVD, however, is the worst one every made. The Hymns are great and inspirational, but the singing is down, not up. The title song is one of the most dreary versions ever sung. Most, but not all the rest, do not move one. They are slow and unmoving. The picture quality is very poor; it looks as if it were made decades ago. There is nothing live here."
3,Reliable but hard to set up,I have used polar products before. Their products perform very well. However their instructions and setup are not very user friendly. Once past that the product is great.
2,For Women or Anorexic Men,"I bought the FS1 on sale today at a local sporting goods shop. I'm not looking for much, just a simple heart-rate monitor; and at first glance, this seemed to fit the bill. Having looked at other stores, I noticed that most of the Polar products on the shelf were clearly marked for women. I found the FS1 in dark blue and naively thought it was made for men. The wrist strap on the watch component, however, is far too short. If I use the very last eyelet, I can squeeze it onto my wrist (yes, I'm a hefty guy, but I'm carrying the weight around my middle, not around my wrists). I'm not asking Polar to make all of its products for women in pink, just give a guy a heads-up somehow."
2,It's ok.,"A lower end heart rate monitor. It's works fine for displaying your HR. If you want to keep track of multiple things simultaneously, get a higher-end version."
2,Polar Heart Monitor Wadh,Watch works well. Trying to secure watch to wrist is difficult because of configuration of watch band. Watch directions are an enigma.
4,FS1 Heart Rate Monitor Watch (Polar,The heart Monitor is very useful and very easy to handle with it.I liked very much and recommend the product
2,Polar FS1 Heart Rate Monitor Watch,I am a bit disappointed with this item. The strap on chest monitor is difficult to secure (keeps popping apart while trying to put it on)and it is hard to find the information you are looking for on the watch when you are running.
1,watch out for polar....,sent a polar heart rate monitor back for a new battery (compliemntary service) and they are charging me US$50 for repair of damage that didn't exist before I sent it. Once the monitor's battery is dead you will need to sen dit back to them...
4,Simple easy to use,"I purchased this to monitor my HR for optimum results while jogging. It took about 5 minutes to set up and learn to use, and now I just put it on and it gives me what I need - no hassles or fumbling with buttons while I run. After using it for about 2 months I have found that some more features would be nice, like lap or split times, but that's no big deal. For the price this monitor is a great value, but now I have taken up bike riding and also need a bike computer :-) Time to do some more shopping."
3,good for the price,works well No light but it was easy to use and simple for wife to figure out. not alot of buttons :)
3,There is a problem with this item that could be easily corrected.,This is my second Polar FS1 that I have ordered from Amazon. Amazon does not list a size for this product even though it is sold with different size chest straps. Amazon always ships a MEDIUM size chest strap. Why not either offer sizes or always ship a LARGE size. The straps are adjustable and a LARGE could be reduced to fit most people. However a medium is not big enough for many customers.
5,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for something easy to use. As I have started training and wanting to lose weight, I have needed to manage my heart rate. This is perfect. It belt picks up on the treadmill, and the watch beeps if I am below or above my heart rate zone for weight loss I pre-programed. I would recommend if you need/want to stay within a particular heart rate zone."
3,Polar FS-1,"I enjoy using my Polar heart rate monitor. It is the first heart rate monitor I have ever purchased as I needed it for a college class. It is simple and easy to use. I wish it did have an alarm on it, but I guess I would have had to pay more for a heart rate monitor with an alarm."
4,buyer beware,"This is a good simple heart monitor. However, you cannot replace the battery in the chest strap yourself. When the battery dies in the chest strap you'll have to buy a new strap or send it off to a Polar Service Center for an extended vacation. Right now, a new strap is about $45.00. Keep this in mind because the battery will die 6 mos. to a year after purchase depending upon how much you excercise and how much you monitor your heart rate. In my opinion, I think Amazon needs to make it perfectly clear in the product description that you can't replace the battery yourself."
4,Polar FS1 Heart Rate Monitor - an Outstanding Value,"I have participated in an arobic training program for more than 30 years. I know the importance of utilizing a heart rate monitor for healthy results. The Polar FS1 Heart Rate Monitor is the best value I have found to perform that vital function. The digital readout is large and easy to read. It gives you your current heart rate, minutes of activity, and upon completion it will provide the user with an average heart rate. One drawback of this model is that it will only record time on task up to one hour, and at that time the stop watch stops."
1,HUGE,"This watch is monstrous. I didn't use the HR monitor that came along with it because the plastic band was extremely painful. I have a HR monitor that has an elastic band all the way around with a small 1in monitor that snaps into place. Much more comfortable. The watch would not read appropriately (I have another polar watch that when I had both together the other was correct), it addition it made a ticking sound.If you are looking for the most basic thing you can find and have a thick wrist go for it, but if you plan on wearing this for any length of time and are a hardcore fitness person, I would recommend spending the extra money on a fully elastic HR monitor and a decent watch."
5,It works by the book,"It's very simple to use, and it works by the book. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, and if you only need to control your heart rate as a normal user, it's perfect."
4,Must use waistband.,The unit works fine. I was disappointed that a waistband must be worn to capture heart rate. The description did not mention this.
1,Don't but unless you are willing to throw away after 2 years,"This product worked great however I did not realize that after 2 years the battery would be dead and it's NOT replaceable on the sending unit. If you don't mind buying something that has a limited life this is for you, but I like to be able to use my purchases for a longer time than the life of a battery."
3,Very basic heart rate monitor,"If you want a heart rate monitor that will track your exercise time and heart rate, both in real time as well as the average during your workout session, then this is your monitor. It's fairly easy to use and comfortable to wear but doesn't switch functions very well, meaning it's easy to start the stop watch but to switch the display of your heart rate (only) can be kludgey and unresponsive. I like that you can set your high and low heart rate values and turn on/off the notification beep when you're below or above your heart range. In retrospect, I would have purchased a better model that can sync up to the polar website to track my fitness progress."
4,very easy just what I wanted,This is perfect for someone who is working out wanting to stay in there zone. Very simple I didn't even have to read the directions to use it.
1,Dead on arrival,"This item was ordered and delivered from J&R. It arrived in a sealed plastic case, needing a box-cutter to open. It was totally non-functional. I do not blame the retailer. It is not their job to inspect every item before shipping, difficult as it is to see the display in the package. I thought pushing the button would start the clock (and HR monitor) but it was dead. I have arranged for a refund from the shipper. But beware of buying this product."
2,too much work,"I haven't even used it. The watch is easy enough but then there's this band that needs to be dampened lightly with water in order to work. The band goes around your waste and is not an easy velcro but in 2 pieces that need to be tied. It's impossible to do yourself, you need to be near a sink and have someone else there to tie it for you! It's already at the bottom of a drawer somewhere, never to be used."
4,excellent source of reference for primatology enthusiasts,"During college, I used this book extensively to gather initial information on primates. This book covers anywhere from the evolutionary relationship of primates, to the current dentition of any primate species. The book does an excellent job of cataloging primate species to be easily referenced."
5,Simply wonderful!,"This album is a MUST for everybody who likes Christmas and Christmas music. The artist's incredible voice combines with beautiful arrangements and a perfect mix of classic and more modern Christmas songs as well as a new song composed by the artist himself. If you buy this album, you - like me - will feel the magic of Christmas all year long!"
4,Built like a Mouse,"Very good album, must have if you are a Built to Spill or Modest Mouse fan. Features the same ""airy"" guitar sound with interesting and diverse tempo's."
3,old movie on vhs,Of course on VHS the quality ca not be too good. You want to watch this only if you have seen it in your childhood.
1,Very Disappointed,This book is for Lotus Notes users only. Absolutely not for Domino admins. The help database is a lot more useful for admins. The author should take Domino part off the book's title.
1,Might be good for a total beginner,"Mastering is not what you will be doing if you read this. Understading Notes and Domino maybe, but certainly not a master.I was hoping for more..."
2,Need Lotus help? Buy a different book.,"This book includes exhaustive detail on how to click menu items to get to a dialog box. Nothing at all about why this inexplicable, illogical software does what it does, or how to understand its methods. I could have used the Help file and received the same amount of information for free."
5,a blast from the past!!,"It is a cool bot, an old school megaman robot master that is a robot ninja!! what else could you want!! and its a vinyl toy so it is durable and not too posseble. it still rocks though!! Also makes a great gift for the old shool gamer in your life!"
3,Meant for the western students of the Dharma.,"The Eastern student can still gather a handful of gems of insight in this book. The chapters titled, ""Awareness, and Meditation: Let it be"", are worth reading repeatedly. Here are the gems: (during meditation)""Just be open, with no holding and no center"".....""no point of reference"".....""Relax and let go of the watcher"". ""We are able to directly experience mind as a process"". ""Transitoriness is not a threat at all;it is instead the opening to new horizons"". Now for the best gem: ""Inherent in the realization that our everyday world is actually always changing is the realization of intrinsic awareness"". This book can be read for that single insight. This is the heart of the Buddhist realization.However it is sad to note that even Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche has resorted to the cliche of the ""space between thoughts"" as though thoughts are things with spatial location. It is preferable to call it as the time between two thoughts."
1,Doesn't taste as good as other brands,"I have been buying dried mulberries from a little random Turkish shop semi-near me. To alleviate the hassle of biking there, I thought I'd try buying these off amazon. I was disappointed with the quality. They don't taste nearly as good. These might be for you if you've never tried another brand of dried mulberry, but if you're used to something better, this product just won't do."
1,"Good product, but this bag was moldy","I absolutely love Navitas mulberries, but they seem to have a problem with quality control. The bag I received was very moist and had many moldy berries. Amazon refunded the purchase price, which I appreciated."
3,What a waste!,"The hero and heroine were wonderful, believable and enjoyable. Their interaction and dialogue was great. Unfortunately the plot was too hilly billy and boring. Less rocky mountain stuff and more family interaction with Whip's siblings would have made this a wonderful book for me. This would NEVER be in the top 20 of my favorite books. Sorry."
3,"You'll want to strangle Whip, but you'll love him at the same time","I hate the stories with the hero always resisting love for nearly throughout the book...Whip is definitely the alpha male who runs from love. He literally tries to flee because he thinks love is a trap to keep him from yondering around the world. I love he comes back in the end because he needs her though she should made him at least grovel. Whip keeps pushing her away and good writing is what saved this from being rated 2.5 starsThis is a series, but I'm not into Elizabeth Lowell's books. Maybe I'll read more of her books if I'm bored"
2,Didn't care for this product,Not what I expected - poor quality and more of a tourism promotion than reality. I expected more from this product.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!! - IT IS NOT ORIGINAL!!,"This film is an almost exact duplicate of Rick Ray's famous ""The Soul Of India"" DVD which I purchased a few years ago!It looks like they removed Ray's narration (adding a pretentious sounding British narrator saying Ray's exact words), cut out any sections where Ray appears and threw it all onto a cheap DVD for resale.I wonder if Amazon (or Rick Ray!) is aware of this cheap ripoff of his work. It looks like it comes from some duplicating factory in India, so probably they are stealing works from the West and re-issuing them as cheap knockoffs.Since the original film featuring Rick is charming and wonderful, why settle for this crummy, patched together, and obviously stolen work?"
2,Psalms,"It's okay, but haven't listened to it but once, and that was just for a few minutes. Just wasn't impressed by whoever was speaking."
5,for those who thirst,"Great product, only problem I have is that a few cds don't play well towards end, in my computer."
2,Didn't remove any hair,"Disclaimer: this was my first attempt with a DIY wax hair-removal product. Still, I followed all instructions, and all it did was make my skin goopy and removed one single hair."
1,Do not buy,"Even if you follow the instructions on the box to a tee, these wax strips do NOT remove ANY hair! All they do is leave a a sticky goo on your skin. Very disappointing..."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these strips at a local drugstore, as they were the cheapest form of wax on the shelves. The first couple times, I didn't follow the directions exactly, but on the 3rd try I certainly did. I took a shower, made sure everything was dry, even put on some baby powder so the wax would stick to the hair, not my skin. I rubbed the strips between my hands for a while, and they peeled apart easily. What I ended up with was 1 or 2 hairs removed (max), sticky skin, PAIN, and a sticky razor after I had to shave when these didn't work. The wax wouldn't come off my skin or my razor or my clothes. I'll have to try a different type of wax."
1,Eh...,"Since I'd never waxed my legs before, the first time I tried these I figured I'd done something wrong. But after a few tries I really don't think it's me. I followed the directions and tried all the tips on waxing I could find and always with the same result: A fair amount of wax and most of the hair left behind. I don't know if it's because my hair's super fine or what but these didn't work for me at all."
1,i hated this item,words cant express how badly i hated this item it didnt work at all and left a gross stinky substance on my body and the little pads the give you dont work...alcohol works after a while but all in all i hated it and will never suggest this product to anyone
1,Horrible,"Do not, do not, DO NOT buy this. This product is horrible. After using about 3 strips, I was STILL left with patches of hair here and there. So I thought, ""Okay, maybe I need to let the hair grow a little longer before I do it."" Did that work? Nope! Only 1/4 of the hair was gone, and my skin was very red and irritated. This product is very messy too. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS. You'll be wasting your time and your money. Yesterday, I orderedMoom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Packagebecause of the many positive reviews for it. Let's hope that works, unlike THIS product."
1,Adverse Reaction,"I just used the product (Nads facial wax strips)a couple of days ago on my upper lip. I did find that I had to use two strips and had to do each side three times in order to get all the hair. After finishing, I noticed that my lip was red and slightly swollen but that's normal. The next morning, I had a thin scab exactly in the middle of my upper lip. How mortifying! When I touch the area, it feels like a carpet burn and is still kinda painful. So I would have to agree with the lady who reported chemical burns because that is definitely what I have. I think I will try another brand next time since I had some issues with the Nads facial wand as well."
1,Don't worth even a dollar,"This is the worst waxing product I have ever used. It does not remove the hair, even though my hair is usually easily removavble."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought Nads Body Wax Strips as a last resort (as the wax strips I normally buy were not in stock). Honestly? What a waste of money. You are supposed to rub the strips briskly between your hands to ""warm"" the strips and then pull them apart. I rubbed 3 different strips for about a minute, and each time I pulled them apart, the wax stayed on one strip only. So, I took a strip and warmed it in the microwave for a minute. When I pulled them apart, they both had wax on them. I then put a strip on my lower leg and rubbed the 3-4 times (per the directions) and pulled the strip off my leg. The strip came off, but the wax stayed on my leg!Do not buy this product. It is a cheap and inefficient way to wax legs and ends up being a waste of money instead :("
3,Acceptable,"It removes most of the hair on my upper lip, but definitely not all of it. As long as you don't wax the same area more than twice (as the instructions say), it's not rough on your skin."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"I have been waxing my bikini area myself at home for years. I always like to try new products and should have listened to the negative reviews. I know what I am doing when it comes to waxing myself, and I could not get these strips to work! No matter how quickly I tried to pull up the strip, it just left a goopy mess in my hair. Maybe one or two hairs came out with each pull. I can take the normal pain, but these actually bruised me so badly because the wax just stuck to my skin too much and not my hair. I wonder if there is a bad batch or something since some people have had the same problem? Very disappointing waste of time, money, and too painful."
1,NO way,"I bought this stuff because I had used Nads in the jar and really liked it. I couldn't find that kind at my walmart, so I had to buy this stuff. I figured it would be easy since the strips already had the wax on them. You have to warm the wax between your hands, which is fine unless you cut the strips. I had to because they were huge and I was doing my bikini line. When you rub the cut strips, the wax comes out the sides...messy. I followed the instructions, when I pulled the strip off, no more than five hairs came off on one strip, some had none. It's always uncomfortable to wax, this experience was no different. I will NOT be buying these again. I bought the sally hansen lavender wax kit, so we'll see how that works."
5,Best Wax Strips,"Love this product!! Easy to use, no mess & the results are wonderful! I've tried all the popular waxing strips - Nair, Sally Hansen, etc. and Nad's is definitely the best. My skin is less irritated & the strips are re-usable multiple times unlike the other brands"
1,Had to throw away BOTH packs!!!,I've used Nad's strips in the past with great success. Absolutely loved them. But the strips I got are either A)Quality control has gone WAY DOWN HILL or B) I got the packs that were 10+ years old. The wax sticks to your face and doesn't come off with the pull so you are left with globs of strip on your face that you have to painstakingly rub off with rubbing alcohol. I can see from other reviews that they've had similar experiences. Nad's needs to pay close attention because their customers will (and have) found better products.
1,Completely unusable,"I love this product normally, but the packages that were sent to me from this vendor were completely unusable. No matter how I tried to use it the wax stuck only to my skin and was not removed when pulling the strip off the skin. Instead the strips would rip or would come off leaving the wax remaining on the skin. I tried using it as directed as I normally do, after the product failed in this usage, I tried heating it with a hair dryer, which led to the same results. Very frustrating, painful ordeal. I originally placed this order under subscription, but after receiving this first delivery, I will not purchase from this vendor again. Very, very disappointed."
1,Horrible,"These strips are horrible. Most of the wax sticks and stays on my leg.My skin got red because while removing the wax was staying back on my legs instead of sticking to the strip.Same stirips i picked up from CVS, they were fine."
1,Old product delivered,"These strips really do work, but only if the strips are not old or dried out. I received the pack of 2 from this vendor and the ""wax"" part were dried out (2 out of the 12 strips were useable). They stuck to each other and the adhesive side was not useable. When you buy this product from a pharmacy, it works great. I would not recommend buying this product from the current vendor. Buy at your own risk."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I experimented with two strips, following the directions the first time and for the second by heating the strip for a few seconds in the microwave to see if it being warmer helped. Perhaps I wasn't heating it up enough with my hands? Nothing but a sticky mess and hairy legs greeted me both times. I won't be buying this again."
4,Sweet!,"Wow...I was really surprised that these worked with no heating of the wax. So easy and so cheap!!! Will definitely buy again. I am not able to shave my bikini area at all because I get so many bumps and ingrown hairs. I am so glad I tried these, they will save me tons of time and money I would be spending on waxing this summer!"
1,Old wax strips,"The wax strips I received were old and dry. When I applied a wax strip to my leg, it ripped, leaving a sticky mess of wax without even removing any hair."
5,Great Item but cheaper on Nad's website!,"I love this product...works better than any other prepared wax strip I've used. However, the price of these on amazon is 3 times that on nad's own website. $4 for a pack of 12!!"
1,Doesn't Work!,"I have very fine to medium thickness hair and this product did not remove it, it just left a sticky residue behind. I switched to the Veet strips and they removed the hair completely!"
2,Not enjoyable,"Let me start by saying the I like RB's writing style - she is very descriptive and gives great depth to her characters. That's why I didn't give this book just one star. But I really disliked the story. The story jumps around in time, which I don't like reading, and has several Big Misunderstandings to cause conflict between the h&h, which I *really* don't like reading. If you don't mind either of those plot devices, you may very well love this book. But if either of those techniques bother you as much as they do me, as least you've been warned."
5,"Love,cherish me-i'd search the world for another copy.","1986 was the year I picked up this captivating romance novel.I remember thinking ""lord this is a thick one"" I opened the cover and from the very first paragraph,I was inthrawed with the characters and the plot.The author took you from High sociity to the pits of hell,the untamed west.This so captivated my imagination that in the years since,I have not forgotten this book(which i completed in 5 days).I would have named my last child Storm,if only ""HE"" had been a girl.<G>This character went through so much and the way she handled herself,struck a cord with me.To survive and to thrive is the best revenge ever.Thank you Rebecca for your words,they take us back to where it all started....in the hearts of all who have loved so intensly .........."
3,"starts out well,","then seems to move very quickly with little explanation as to the passage of time. It seems that one day the girl is used to servants and living on a plantation, the next she has very rapidly become used to things such as guns, being on the run and the type of life that goes with that, being alone with a man and then living and conversing with indians. On top of that she seems to become part of the indians overnight and even gives birth like them (she must not scream or even cry out, etc) and all of this she embraces with hardly any trouble. My liking for the hero was on and off, sometimes he treated the heroine very lovingly and then the next instant he's leaving her and their son to go off and fight or do whatever it is he thinks is more important. I expected a better book, such as Brandewynes ""The Outlaw Hearts"" which was very well written and very flowing."
2,Not Sure I read the Same Book...,"I'm lost by the STRONG reviews going on here. While the book had an interesting plot where the heck was the editor? At some point chapters would almost repeat verbatin paragraphs from other chapters. I could also do without the instructions on how to work her voicemail... ""press 1 to listen to messages"", so I pressed 1, ""press 2 to repeat"" so I pressed 2. The leaps in logic were off on how she figured out the mystery. At times the story switched between 1st and 3rd person but during the same paragraph which is very odd to read.Lots of potential but didn't hold up. Fire your editor and let's try again."
2,"Great Story, Slow Read","Investigating the alleged wrongful death of the hospital's own CFO, attorney Karen Hayes uncovers a betrayal of trust, both professional and personal, evidence of criminal fraud, and hints of corruption. Now her job-and her life-are on the line. A line that a murderer is all too willing to cross. The storyline was interesting but the book was a slow read. There was too much useless information that was used to pad the book. I think the relationship between Karen and her husband could have been left out or atleast shortened. I like medical thrillers but this one just doesn't make the cut."
4,n.o. rap!,this is a tight rare album from smoke 1 records. it features the legendary TRE-8.I have this UNOPENED on cd 4 SALE for cheap price and a few unopened tre-8`s.lots of other rare oop cds and tapes.EMAIL.
3,Killer Yacht Party,"This movie is your typical horror slasher flick, except that it's on a yacht, and there's a party on the boat. But the real kicker (or killer) about this party is that somebody will die, which is basically the premise of any classic Troma flick.This movie is great because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The production values are stellar, the acting's mediocre (nothing deep about this boat, just the sea level of the voyage), and the premise is straight out of a ""How to Make a Cheesy yet By-The-Books Horror Movie"", with an emphasis on the ""Boat Ride"" chapter. So far, the director has followed it almost word for word, along with cheesy dialogue to make it look obvious that everybody involved in the making of this movie was having fun, because they don't take themselves so seriously. If Scream or The Hills Have Eyes don't tickle your fancy, Killer Yacht Party should definitely do the trick. Just don't get seasick."
2,Spencer film mainly for family-oriented interest.,"Bud Spencer would seem a natural to play the genie, and the film is pleasant enough, with one or two of the signature fight scenes Spencer is famous for, but fans will find the film quite lacking in Bud's usual style of humor and toughness. Instead, he spends too much time on the sidelines, nodding approval to his son (playing the Aladdin character). For the real classics from Bud Spencer, check out ""Crime Busters,"" ""Go For It,"" and ""Odds and Evens!"""
5,"Wonderful album, great deal","I first heard this album in the summer of 2005, and it's one of my favorite alt-country albums ever. The lyrics are quirky and interesting, if not entirely coherent in the strictest sense, but the instrumentation and vocal quality on tracks such as ""Suffolk Down Upon The Night,"" ""Out On The Water,"" ""Denver Annie,"" and ""Sundowner, You"" are beyond reproach.I was very happy to find it for such a reasonable price on here, and I was especially delighted to discover that it was in great condition. Thanks to this seller for making such good music available for good prices."
3,Income Property Valuation Text Review,"This book is used in my graduate-level Real Estate Appraisal class. I found the book to be riddled with errors and typos (for example, the bottom of page 293 shows an example property with an 8% LTV (!!)) and it is a bit dated, however, the use of a CDROM to show examples and a trial ARGUS program is nice. One major problem is that the numerous problems outlined at the end of each chapter are never answered in the book. Thus, the poor student hoping to check to see if his homework answers are correct is out of luck. The case study at the end of the book, the capstone project I assume, is an appraisal of an apartment complex. As users of ARGUS know, an apartment complex cannot be modeled well in ARGUS. The authors should have known that, and its clear that they are out of touch with how real appraisals are done. Overall, I'd say its a typical sloppy textbook written by academics with little to no knowledge of the real world...."
3,Size Matters,"In this case, the manufacture appears to believe that a king-sized blanket fits the exact measurement of the bed. While this is technically correct, if you don't have any extra blanket size to hang over the sides, the actual usable portion of the blanket is considerably smaller than king-sized. I would recommend the king-size blanket for queen-sized beds, queen-size for full, and so on. This cost the product 2 stars off my rating for it.Other than the blanket being smaller than what one would like, it's a very good, heavy blanket. It's important to understand that these 'mink' blankets are kind of stiff and not as soft as you would expect, when you first receive them. However, after each washing, the blanket gets softer and softer. I expect this one to be delightfully soft and warm for many years to come."
3,Speculation or Prophecy?,"I vaguely remember The Road Ahead as the speculation of the days to come for our culture and our civilization. Walters thought the monetary system would collapse into a bartering or exchange system without currency. There were the admonitions to live on the land and simplfy one's lifestyle. Apparently Yogananda suggested the same things, as the earth will provide support if cooperated with on a natural level. He thought communities centered on spiritual values and goals would become the new city/states of a revised culture. I think Walters also suggested some stockpiling - like earthquake preparedness on a grander scale to tide one over. There are few communities based on these principles, but they may well be the models for a more upscaled class of consciousness that is emerging on this planet......."
2,"Its ok, but I am sure there is something better","Bought this to go with my Zire 31. The case fits well - although the cover itself is just a flap - no closure. For carrying around in an outside pocket on my purse its ok. If it were just another piece of floatsam in my suitcase of a purse, I can't imagine it would do much good. Its a little difficult to get the stylus out of the back when the Zire is in the case, but not impossible.The stylus is cool - a blackpen, an orange pen, a pencil and stylus all in one. It took me a few minutes to figure out exactly how to switch from one to another - but I managed. The screen protectors are ok - nothing spectacular. Don't follow the lines printed on the screen cover when you trim them to fit your PDA - the lines for my Zire 31 are a bit small.All in all, this is ok - but I think next time I will try to find a better case. I would advise any PDA noobs to buy the PDA, take it with you to a store that sells cases and pick one out from there."
3,Rather Average. Separate may be better....,"The case is nice. and the screen protectors are handy. Very nice that the lines are marked on them for the differet pda sizes to cut down to.The ""stylus"" is more like a junky leftover from the 80's. no way of telling or chosing which stick is going to come up. there is no stylus, just a pen with no ink which is difficult to discern from the pen that does have ink.It comes nowhere close to fitting in the stylus slot, or anywhere on the case itself... AND why would you need a pencil, pen, and yellow crayon for your pda.......this item in this package has me totally befuddled."
3,huh,was not satisfied the description staed that there were several screen protectors only one was received
3,Not bad for the price,Has all the essentials. Not much use for the pen/stylus. Wish it had replacement styluses (or is it styli).
2,They need to tell people.,"I believe in the title of the Essentials Kit they need to tell the customers that the PDA is NOT INCLUDED. I got the Essentials kit thinking that a pilot was included. When it got here I was shaking and shaking the box, but nothing came out but the kit. I was embarassed and irritated. They need to put it in BIG BOLD PRINT. DOES NOT COME W/ A PDA."
3,One more point,"I agree with the other reviewers that this was not a very good adaptation of GMF's work and poorly cast, at least the Harry Flashman role.One point that has not been mentioned: there is no ending. The end is just left hanging in the air!! The end of the book is side splitting but simple. Elspeth simply asks Harry after all his adventures, ""what did you bring me back from the continent?"""
2,Only worth the curiosity value,"Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the ""least best"" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed."
4,It's about time!,"A great satire of Victorian England and most especially Victorian era Hollywood movies. Lots of laughs in most unusual settings. Who would have guessed Bismark would make such a comic subject? Hard to imagine why this has taken so long to make it to DVD. The only thing too disappointing about this movie is that it was the only one done to date from the immortal Flashman series, certainly Flashman in Afghanistan would be very timely and on target today, but at least the author Fraser and the director teamed up again on the Three Musketeer movies. I'll be happy to challenge to a duel anyone who dares to question my devotion to the books as long as they allow my friend to load the pistols."
2,"Good books, crummy movie","I am forced to cast my vote with those who regard this movie as a failure.To me, the film fails on two counts. The first failure relates to the general approach. How in heaven's name did G. M. Fraser, the author of the wonderfully amusing black comedy novels about that magnificent anti-hero of anti-heroes, General Sir Harry Flashman, come to write such a feeble, would-be action comedy and lowly farcical screen adaptation for this movie?The other failure, and vastly the worse of the two, is the utterly appalling miscasting of Malcolm McDowell as Harry Flashman. The Flashman of the books, a man who cheerfully admits to no virtues whatsoever, is widely admired as a staunch and true hero of Little Vickie's Empire entirely because he looks just like a hero ought to look. Malcolm McDowell most emphatically does not. He looks like ... well, Malcolm McDowell.First-rate books, third-rate movie. Too bad and two stars."
3,Pretty good but not great,"I am a fan of the Wendy Ward novels and decided to give this one a try. It was OK, but a little disappointing. I liked the premise, but it seemed like it took a long time to build any suspense or to head in any kind of direction. Then the final climax scene was a bit of a let down, too. It seemed to me this book could have been either a lot shorter or a lot more complex. But it was not terrible. It's worth a read, especially if you are a Passarella fan."
5,Great,"I use a light meter and this, sometimes the light meter is off but the calibration target allows me perfect exposure every time. I will not shoot without it."
4,Very Portable!,"I was looking for something that could calibrate white balance, act as a reflector and fold up SMALL so it actually fit in my camera bag - this is all 3! It measures about 5.5inches in diameter by 1 inch thick (0.5 inches if you ""smoosh"" it). I'm giving it 4 starts though because I wish the reflector was white instead of silver and it's pretty overpriced given the materials it's made of (though it is very well-constructed)."
5,great buy,"There are a ton of grey card/targets on the market. What sets this one apart is the very in depth and educational video that accompanies your target. The video is 1 hour long and starts with function and use of the target and ends with post processing your pics in Adobe LightRoom. It also folds nicely in a 6"" diameter circle and has a pouch. Buy it."
5,Brilliant!,"Professor Perry offers a brilliant yet easy to understand explanation of the connection between political and economic changes in 18th century England and changes in the role of women.Her grasp of history, literature, politics, and economics has created a unique synthesis. Aside from the inherent value of this book, Professor Perry's work should remind us to reach beyond the boundaries of disciplines and strive for interdisciplinary, transgenerational, and cross-cultural scholarship. A truly remarkable achievement!"
4,Very good,This book is good for students who are literate in their own language. It is difficult to use with students who don't read or write at all. I like using bits and pieces from it here and their.
5,Great,"Hi all. You wouldn't believe this, I've met these people! At an Art camp. They came and showed us dozens and dozens of pictures likt the one in Thailand with a flower. It was a couple years back and they had planned to buy a book for us when it came back. They said they are going to go on Jay Leno and Rosie O'donnel. Well, I just got the book and I am advancing in balloon art. From crazy hats to a pup dog. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone! All ages!"
5,These guys are incredible!!!!,These guys traveled the world for 3 years taking photographs of people wearing balloon hats. Check out .... A one of a kind art project and something sure to bring a smile to anyone's face!
3,celine's better,"reviewer ""VAB"" is wrong. celine dion has surpassed lara fabians vocals on many occations( i should know i have all her albums and lara fabians). saying that she was trying to rival lara is crazy since celine has been making albums since she was 12 and was already known in the french speaking world before lara fabian.i give props to lara for writing but not all of her songs are very good though i do like her.further more, about how many languages celine has sung in: french, english, italian, spanish,japenese,german. don't get me wrong i like lara fabian but she is no celine."
5,Fantastically yujmmy. I love it!,This is great agave nectar. My only complaint is that I wish it came in bigger bottles. I use ALL the time.
5,Great Product!,"I use this instead of sugar in oatmeal, on top of grapefruit, and in cookie recipes because I have hypoglycemia. I love it. It is the only sweetner that I have tried that I like as much as sugar."
5,A nice change from your average sweetener,For those of us with glycemic (blood sugar) issues this is my favorite sweetener for my morning cup of tea. More subtle than honey and by far more pleasant than table sugar. I love honey but the texture and flavor of this agave is wonderful.
5,Waldo D.,I am very pleased with Wholesome Sweeteeners Organic Raw Blue Agave. I use it in beverages and also some of the things that I cook. It leaves no after taste and is low glycemic. It is much better for you than processed sugars.
5,THE BEST SWEETENER OUT THERE,"By far... the best, no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels, worth every penny!"
5,Great sweetner,I have a serious sweet tooth. I bought this product while trying to find ways to cut down the amount of white sugar in my diet. This is a great sweetener. It has a flavor reminiscent of honey. I especially like it in oatmeal and in hot tea (the liquid form makes it great for iced teas as well). I'm excited to see what other uses there are for it. Give it a try! It's worth it.
3,Wholesome Sweeteners Raw Agave Nectar,"Price was good and it was delivered quickly, however, I did not care for the taste. I listed the unopened bottles and sold them on eBay!"
2,Good 'n Sweet,"Good stuff! I have a sweet tooth, and agave syrup helps me stay away from cane sugar. It's great in smoothies and just about anything else.I love the taste.I've learned to not use it everyday though, or for longer periods of time, as it seems to be an anti-nutrient which causes muscle cramping after prolonged use.I don't have that problem with maple syrup, honey, or natural raw cane juice.A little agave syrup goes a long way though because it is very sweet and not expensive and that makes it practical when preparing food for a large crowd."
2,Did something change?,"I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years. When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.Each bottle had about a half inch of foam on top and had a very strong plastic or soapy taste. It's hard to describe but it was so bad I was unable to use it. I contacted Amazon and they were great, sent out a new order right away but when I received the shipment it was as bad as the first. When I contacted Amazon again they refunded my purchase price and actually made this product unavailable while they checked in to it. I see it is available again but I never found out what the issue was.I figured it must have been a bad batch so I reordered and did get a new shipment last week, this time of the 2 44 oz bottles. It was just as bad. I contacted customer service and they were great and promptly refunded my money.I ended up ordering another very popular, but more expensive, brand. This 'other' brand is much better. No problems at all."
4,You'll use very little!,"This agave syrup is very good, very sweet, so you do not have to use very much. Great in healthy muffins."
5,Vegan Daughter loves this!,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter, who is a vegan. She recently moved out & can no longer afford to buy Agave. She was delighted when she received this as a Christmas present. She called me after using & said it was the best Agave she has ever tasted! I will be reordering for her when she runs low on this."
5,Great ASL for Practice!,The American Sign Language Puzzle Book is a great way to enjoy practicing your ASL while doing Puzzles. The only thing is the photos are hard to identify. They are not color photos. You have to know your ABCs to play games where you have a choice deciding the letters or identifying what the person is saying in ASL.It's a great way to keep up with your practicing. I would recommend this to anyone at any level.
3,Serious Stuff,"This book addresses the subject of possession, how to avoid it and when to seek help. If you feel the possibility of entities have influence over a human being is not possible, this book is not for you. If you are open to the possibilities of angels, entities and demons, then this book addresses from a prationers view point what to look for and and how negativity could influence an individual. There are many books on this subject, but this one addresses the issues from how prayer can help your life. I wouldn't try some of the workings on my own, but seek out someone who knows what they are doing."
2,"Two good tracks, two medium, rest - filler","This was definitely a disappointment for the fans - after two really good records they got this piece of ... hmm ... vinyl. ""Anything You Got..."" is great fast number. ""If You See Kay"" is original and very entertaining - an attentive listener will surely immediately notice the naughty wordplay but even without it the song is catchy and extremely listenable. But that's where the fun stops. ""Enough is Enough"" is decent rocker and ""Waiting on a Miracle"" is more or less OK but the rest is pretty uninspired."
3,"Excellent projector, but bad lamp life","I have used this projector in large meeting rooms that hold 100 people and smaller board rooms that hold fewer. The color reproduction is accurate, brightness is effective even in half-lit rooms, and the power-on time is just a few seconds. Noise from the fan is not so much that it drowns out the speaker, but it is audible. Lamp life was disappointing, and the cost of a new lamp is almost as much as a new machine. If you get one of these used, be sure the lamp is new, otherwise you might as well buy a new -- and newer -- machine."
3,Not good enough,"It's good, but not good enough for my hair. I want it totally straight.Oh, after I put this, it's a little more dry."
2,Beware Product contains PARABENS,I bought this item thinking it was all natural and healthy. It looked like an awesome product. However when I checked the ingredients it said it had parabens in it! I was shocked!! I try to avoid parabens like the plague. This aloe probably works well for a while on the surface of the skin but meanwhile your skin is absorbing hormone disrupting parabens which will most likely in time make you breakout. I bought this product for my babys diaper rash and I am a breastfeeding mother so I didn't wanna use it so I returned it. Bummer It looked like such a great product.
5,loved it!,"i love the way Mary keeps you hanging with each of her novels leading into the next one. hopefully darius has not did himself in but we'll see in the next one. i love the way she takes darius through emotional waves of despair bring him out then throw him back in. he's a spoiled rich ""boy"" who cares about no one but himself. is it wrong for me to always want to see him get his? this is a page turning must read! but start form the begining with soul mates dissapate."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,I didn't like the plot because it seemed very unrealistic. There was way too much graphic sex that didn't add to the character development. It wasn't engaging to me at all. Maybe I just didn't like any of the characters in the book.
3,3.5 stars,"This book is like a Black soap opera. For me, it started off slow and then picked up. But when it picked up... it REALLY picked up! As bad as Darius is you just have to love this brotha and his ""I'm better than you attitude"". He is a complete and total trip. Fancy is almost as bad. I did like this book.The only thing I didn't like was the SERIOUS soap opera drama going on. It almost made my head hurt trying to keep up with everyone and thier issues. Mary is a very good writer so it's not that bad. I will be getting the next book because I just have to find out what happens to everyone and if the homeless lady's predictions come true."
5,Off the hook!!!!!,"The best series of books ever topped off with this mind blowing fifth book. I read all five books one after another and am disappointed that the sixth isn't out yet. Purchase them all and you wont be sorry!!!!! Keep up the good work, Mary."
2,If the rest of the books worth the read.,"This is the fifth book of a series and if you have read the others it is worth the read. There were parts of the story that were so HOT there was steam practically coming off the pages, but that didn't make up for the boring parts at all. The first 50-60 pages were mostly catch up from the previous books. It is a slow starter. I still mananged to read the book in under 10 hours because so much of the book was from the previous books. I really expected authors writing to be more polished in this release. I loved Fancy's parts the best as this is the charactor that has the most devolpment. Darrius' and Jada are becoming played out. I will be starting the next book today ""When Somebody Loves You Back."" Hopefully there will be more to say."
5,Love the entire series!,"Mary Morrison is an absolute pleasure to read. Her pacing is solid and the ""intimate"" scenes are off the hook. Her entire series is wonderful. They keep getting better and better; keep up the good work Ms. Morrison."
4,I enjoyed this book,"It was pretty good, if you could get pass all of the sex and bad lanuage. The young man seemed to learn a good lesson toward the end but maybe not. The woman certainly did. She learned that she needed to take care of herself not depend on others."
2,Beat up Book,"I recieved it quickly, but the book was beat to hell pretty much. Kind of sad for the cover but it was a really great read."
2,No big deal,"The illustrations are the best part of this book, and one (at least) has been made into a beautiful poster for Yosemite Park. But the supposed Indian legend lacked for me the charm of a mythical tale told well. The child in me was not fascinated by the story. I bought it because someone gave me the poster, which I framed; I like the poster better than the book."
2,"A Certified Leftie Says ""Don't Bother""","Now, I'm a card-carrying progressive, and I watch every liberal documentary and read every progressive/leftie/ecological book that comes down the pike. But this book is blazingly boring. I bought it because it has great blurbs on the back, and it has a promising index (any book that has Herman Daly, Juliet Schor, and Kirkpatrick Sale in its index has to be good, right?). But the content has no soul whatsoever. I had never read anything by Alperovitz before, so I don't know if his prior work is any better. But this one is a yawner. I mean, I never skip through passages of liberal policy books, but I just had to scan through significant portions of this stuff. It's just that dry and uninspiring. I guess maybe this is for policy wonks only. But if you're a layperson, don't bother. Pick up ""Going Local,"" or the new annotated version of ""Small is Beautiful"" instead. You'll find it much better going."
1,book for school,I bought this book for a class at college. I am really tired of this propoganda. I do not agree with the viewpoints.
5,A Triumph in Historical Revisionism,"Revisionist giant Harry Elmer Barnes is at his battling best in these essays and reviews on the Second World War, and on the ""Cold War"" with the Soviet Union that soon followed. Professor Barnes takes passionate issue with the writings of his historian colleagues, whether in the academy or (increasingly) in the Pentagon and the CIA, on the causes, conduct, and results of America's ""crusade"" against Germany and Japan. Stern assessments of the establishment accounts, from Walter Millis to William Shirer, that laid the groundwork for today's wrongheaded history, and vital reviews of the studies that refute them, including A. J. P. Taylor's Origins of the Second World War and David Hoggan's Erzwungene Krieg (Forced War). Aimed at Cold War America's march toward global embroilment and a ""new world order,"" these ""Essays against Interventionism"" hit home amidst harum-scarum U.S. involvement all around the planet."
4,"The VERY 1st Revisionist Historian. America's contribution to world peace, if our leaders would read his books!","Author, Professor, Criminologist andSocialogist Harry Elmer Barnes bestof 20-30 classic books he publishedand wrote during his lifetime. Thebest American Historian of all time.Which is why the Big Brother Estab-lishment ignores him. Miss thesebooks at your peril, Mr. and Mrs.America!"
5,Barnes at his best !,"Harry Elmer Barnes at his best.In this collection of essays Barnes destroys the ""court historians"" and their fairytale accounts of the origins and outbreak of WWII.Also detailed are the efforts of the ""blackout boys"" to censor and supress books that tell the truth about these events,something that is still going on today,fifty years after some of these essays were first written."
5,amazing patterns,"I have ordered different kind of papers for wrapping my soaps (origami, wrapping papers etc) but unfortunately these papers have the wrong size. The patterns are really lovely and my daughter loves them for her cut and paste projects but I can't use them for my initial intention. But, they are very beautiful nevertheless."
4,A Fine Suspense,"James W. Hall not only tells an intriguing story, but his quality of writing is superior to most in this genre."
4,Really Hits!,I've got to say I've heard a lot of French/English rap. This has got to be the best! With a system that has a lot of bass this album sounds really great~!
5,Amazing,"I don't know any French, but this album is amazing. It is on the WU-TANG level and there is even some WU in it. I can listen to this cd all day. The beats are unreal, and they have good flow."
5,Merci,"Pour un Marseillais, quel plaisir de voir que notre rap s'exporte et est apprécié par les étrangers. Mme si on est pas né sous la mme étoile, merci du soutien."
4,Alton-ish Roasting Rack,We decided this year to give the Alton Brown roast turkey a try. One thing that I didn't have was a roasting rack. I set out in search of the same one that he used with no success of finding it. The next best thing is this rack. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be large enough for the 20lb turkey we were roasting. In use it turned out to plenty long but a little narrow. The wings ended up resting on and sticking to the baking sheet. I was able to cut them free with little trouble. The other complaint I had with this rack involves the handles. Specifically that they swing out flat when not being used to lift the turkey. This tended to get in the way a bit when moving the bird into the oven. I would still rather have these handles than no handles at all like some other racks. I would give this rack five stars if it were a little wider and if the handles would stay more vertical when not in use.
1,at least mine was nogood,"It broke right away, it didn't even make it through Thanksgiving!!!I would not recommend it to anyone. Good idea bad poorly made."
1,Oh no! I can no longer completely trust reviews...,"As another reviewer stated, the 5 star reviewers are trying to sell the product. I checked ""see all my reviews"" for the first few reviewers and lo and behold they gave 5 star reviews to ALL KINDS of instructional sports videos including basketball, hockey, lacrosse, baseball, coaching and on and on. Either these guys work for these companies in some capacity, or they've never met a product they didn't (5 star) love. Shame. I use reviews ALL THE TIME to make decisions, now I guess I have to research the reviewers before I can believe them. Dang."
4,Golf Lessons:Keep Your Eye On The Ball! Great Golf Tips!,BACKYARD GOLF is a fine compilation of tips that willincrease fundamental golf skills. Simple drills thatcan be done in confined areas make this a good investment.A SOLID BUY!
1,The DVD producers wrote all these reviews!,"What is Amazon's role in at least making some attempt to verify these reviews as legit? It's obvious from looking at the reviews and the reviewers' other reviews that they were done by the producers of this series. Shame on the producer/director, and on Amazon.I'd think twice about buying anything from Amazon based on reviews, after seeing this."
3,A Basic Course in Sign Language,"This is the book that was required for my class. It could have better illustrations, however, with the instructor demonstrating, we have figured it out. Love the spiral binding!!"
3,Ok Book but I have purchased better ones,"The only reason I purchased this book was it was required for the course ASL I I was taking at a local college. The instruction is not in depth at all and does not explain anything at all. All the signs were picture only and no text explaining how to do it. Unless your instructor requires this book, I would not recommend purchasing it."
3,This provides a good basic understanding of Deaf language.,"This book does an overall good job of demonstrating ASL grammar and vocabulary. Sometimes the vocabulary words include English usage without specifying that the particular sign is not used in that manner in ASL. Other than that, it is a very good course, and provides a good understanding of the interaction of facial and body language with the manual signs for complete communication with the Deaf."
4,Good text and reference book,"My husband and I decided to take a course in Amrican Sign Language as I son-in-law is deaf. This text is organized well into subjects (people, actions, colors, etc). I do wish sometimes that the entire book presented the signs entirely in alphabetical order for reference, but the categorization seems very reasonable for teaching/learning purposes."
2,"Good but not near as good as ""The Joy of Signing""","I ordered this book for the class I was taking. I like the spiral binding as it makes it easier to work with. However I don't think it is all that well-organized. It would be better if all the related signs were presented together. For example, food in one section, travel in another. I think the biggest problem is that there are no word descriptions on how to make a certain sign or reasoning behind the sign which helps a great deal when trying to remember it. I found a good sign language dictionary and the book "" The Joy of Signing"" and they are, in my opinion, the best resources for learning sign language."
2,fair not great,"The book was not in as good as shape as they said it was, still usable but I spent a few extra dollars to get one in better shape and was disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"This book was described as in good shape, but the pages are printed out of order and it's very hard to use. I was forced to copy the pages and put them in a separate book. I contacted the seller several weeks ago and was not afforded the courtesy of a reply.I am very reluctant to use this service again, nor will I recommend it."
3,basic course in american sign language,I purchased this book for my ASL class. Some of the signs are outdated but most are not. It is most helpful in understanding ASL grammar. The illustrations of the signs are okay but a dvd of the vocabulary would great.
5,Sign language book,"The book came nicley packaged. It was in used condition, but actually looked new. No marks or writing in the book."
5,wall mount works,Well I must say that this is my second wallmount from peerless and It works for me. It does a verticle swivel but that wasn't very important for me. Simple to install and works with my monitors.
2,Poorly written (and overpriced) explanation of pivot tables,"I bought this book after first beginning to use pivot tables and appreciating how easily they could be used to create and populate tables to present descriptive statistics. I had hoped that this book would show good examples of how to use pivot tables and further understand their features. This book really added very little to the basic understanding that I developed by simply experimenting with Excel and the various commands associated with pivot tables. It really has a low information-to-page ratio. Two much better resources on the topic are the website http://www.datapigtechnologies.com/ExcelMain.htm (really fine FREE online tutorials) or the book Excel Data Analysis: Your Visual Blueprint for Creating and Analyzing Data, Charts and PivotTables that provides quite a bit of information on pivot tables, along with a number of other topics in a much-better written book than this one."
2,Disappointing,"This book was disappointing. The best part of the book is the section where he describes how to do tasks using the ""old way"" -- without Pivot tables -- that is not what I bought this book for!! I agree with the other opinions that state that this book was rushed out in a hurry -- with poor quality. One reason for this is that many of the examples require you to type in your own data instead of providing an example file in the files that you can download from the web site. There are missing or mistaken instructions. I was looking for a step by step example based approach and this book left me scratching my head in many cases. They spent several pages describing the Pivot Table Wizard. But this description is of little value if you don't tie it to an example or examples. Examples are used later, but as I mentioned before, the examples were done in a hurried and sloppy manner. How about testing the instructions in the book with real users next time!"
2,Pivot Tables for Dummies,Save yourself time and money. If you know the fundamentals of pivot tables and like to learn by playing your time would be best spent experimenting in excel. The book spends much of its space telling you things you should be able to deduce by looking at the excel menus.
2,There's better diaper cream out there...,"I bought this diaper cream based on the good reviews I read, but now I am bummed I have 3 tubes of it! It seems to make my sons rash worse. It doesn't stay on very well for one thing. And hydrogenated castor oil is one of the ingredients-which doesn't seem all that natural with me. I really like Weleda diaper cream, unfortunately Amazon doesn't sell it."
4,Who Is That Musiq Guy,"Dear Customers,For all of you who have not heard this album yet, there are about two songs you'll absolutely hate. The first one is that song from Eve. She could've done better than that. Number 2 is that song from some guy by the name of Musiq. Hello, we already have a D'Angelo, and we're getting pretty tired of that one. But Eminem and Redman's song is straight up crucial.Natalie P. Chicago"
1,stap,"Oh man all the cool Artist are on hear. Man, we got the great one himself on this CD DMX (Thats Dark Man X for all the people that dont know). OK for anyone who reads this let me just tell u save your money this CD is wak. I thought Eddie would pick better artist for his movie."
4,Great CD,Very good CD. Much better than the first one. The first CD was pretty good too. The R&B tracks are pretty good and Jay-z and Eminem make this a Rap hit. And LL is dogging you know who. So check this album out!
5,CON HUNLEY - MMM MMM GOOD !,CON HUNLEY - HE IS STILL THE BEST LOOKING AND BEST SOUNDING MAN GOD EVER MADE !!
5,"Junie B., First Grader: Boss of Lunch","This, among the other Junie B. Jones books, is a fantastic example of children's literature. The journal entries as well as the first-person narration make for a very relatable book for this age level. I know when I was a child, I completely related to Junie B. Jones, despite her love of over-exaggeration. It's childish in a charming way, and I can't wait to keep these books in my classroom when I'm teaching. The series is funny for all ages, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing through this reading of Boss of Lunch. I thought the humor would all be for the kids, but even as an adult, it's hilarious how insane Junie B's mind is. It's just a funny book, possibly even funnier to an adult than to a child!Rating: 5/5"
3,Cool!,"I really enjoyed this book, just like the other Junie B. Jones books. I think that the First Grader books are a bit better that the original books when Junie B. was in kindergarden, in that they have more character depth. Why three stars? Because it needs more content. In other words, basically not much was going on. But I think is would be most suitable for the five to nine year old age range. It's also entertaining for older kids, because they can read about the antics of Junie B. and find it funny, because they can identify with how Junie B. has innocent beliefs, fears, ideas and antics. Overall, I tought that this was a hilarious book that could be improved with more depth and content. I reccommend that you also read the other books in the Junie B. Jones series as well."
4,"Junie B., First Grader: Boss of Lunch","Barbara Park's character, Junie B. Jones, is a favorite of my first and second grade students. Recently I read Junie B., First Grader: Boss of Lunch to my class. My students thoroughly enjoyed the humorous antics of Junie B. as she gets picked for a special job at school. I think that my students especially enjoyed this book because they can relate to Junie B.'s experiences at home and at school. Although the plot of the story kept my students laughing, I was not comfortable with Junie B.'s poor grammar. I know that it's Park's way of conveying Junie B.'s elementary vocabulary, but as a teacher, I don't approve of reading aloud literature that does not promote appropriate grammar. Because my students are so attracted to the Junie B. Jones stories, I will continue to read them aloud to my class, but I've learned to change some of the words as I read to correct the grammar."
1,"If you want your children to learn proper English, stay clear of this series!","Like my description states, stay away from these books. While the stories are cute, the grammar is extremely poor. For example, rather than say ""I quickly ran to the door"", the book is written ""I quick ran to the door"". It just does not make sense.And if you are a parent who understands proper English, it is very hard to read word for word to your child (we usually takes turns reading pages) because the sentence structure is so bad. Even my child who is learning to read has noticed the bad grammar.All the other reviews address the content of the book, which is fine if they like it for the entertainment value. But if you are looking at it like a responsible parent should, its impossible to get past the grammatical errors."
1,The Proletarization of America,"After starting to read this book to my seven-year old grandchild, I stopped on the third page, read the remainder of the book to myself and threw it into the trash. Americans are descending into ever worse English and Ms. Park is partly responsible! Why must we lower ourselves to the level of trash instead of uplifting ourselves? Her theory of creating interest in young people by using bad grammar is obviously idiotic from a logical standpoint. Moreover it is lethal for it continues the trend of lowering standards of excellence in this country (look at where our education system ranks)and prepares children for failure. To create interest in reading is important, but it can be done by reading/giving children books about subjects they like, like sports or hobbies or pets. I have done it and it works. The results of Ms. Park's perverted reasoning should be given all they deserve: the trash can."
1,Terrible Grammar for Emerging Readers,"While the idea behind this book is cute (and the character endearing and true-to-life), the grammar in this book is so bad that it makes it difficult for my 1st grader to read. (She burns through other books written at a similar level, so it's pretty obvious the grammar is tripping her up.)Repeatedly, in almost every sentence, in the prose of the book, there are terribly grammatical ""mistakes"" (made in the voice of the main character). It's terribly distracting for my daughter.It's also a terrible model. While it adds interest to have ""non-standard"" grammar in books meant for older kids and adults, readers this age are still learning to read and write. They learn by copying what they read. I'm steering clear of these books for a long, long time."
4,one reason,the only reason why ghoti hook changed is cause someone dropped out of the band and someone had to take his role.
2,Disappointing,"It's hard to believe this is the same band that cut Sumo Surprise and Banana Man. Some of the songs sounded more like big hair rock from the mid-80's than punk. Skip this one if you are a fan of Ghoti Hook, or of punk in general. If you want a good punk CD, get Wake Up Screaming by Slick Shoes instead."
2,"NOT PUNK, WAY TOO SOFT.............","I must admit that ghoti hook is a great band, but this cd just doesn't cut it. It's not really punk like their other cd's. This cd sounds like something out of the 80's except for the last couple tracks. It's good if you liked the 80's rock style, but it wasn't the PUNK cd I was expecting. If you want more of a punk cd get their Banana Man cd. I thought it was much better than this one."
3,One Word for You- - - LAME,"alrighty...check it... I was highly dissappointed in Ghoti Hook for puting out an album with this type of music. Yeah for the fact that they have matured but Gay for the fact that they dematured if you will. I love Ghoti Hook's prior works cuz they were hard, upbeat, and had a punk sound like no other. Now they have digressed into a 80's hard wuss-rock motif and it just not them. Adam and Conrad will be missed. Adam was a hella good drummer. The only song i was impressed with was ""Chevy Nova"". It had an ounce of what they used to be. I hope you lay off this one and Ghoti Hook will here of the crap people talk about them now and go back to the old daze of good ol' fassioned Punk Rock. Keep it real Banana Man. Remember that. If you want a good cd check out Mxpx-The Everpassing Moment or Slick Shoes-Wake Up Screaming...Or even a Huntingtons cd...Lay off this one...Peace."
2,Waste of Time,"I found this book to be full of shallow, boring monologues. They do not showcase an actors ability at all, and the topics can be little off center to what you might like to perform for an audition (at least I felt so). Adding to that, the pieces are not from plays, which got annoying. They are just informative speeches, no acting required, monotonous ramblings."
2,not worth buying,"I'm glad I just borrowed this from the library.There were a few monologues which were cute, and had witty ideas. However, many of them ended something like 'and that's why i'm never doing drugs/having sex/trusting boys/doing anything bad"" . The author obviously had never spoken in depth with a teenage girl, writing 'like' way too often in strange places.Not worth buying, but maybe worth borrowing from the library?"
2,Good Drill -- Bad Charger,I bought this drill a couple years ago and it worked great until last week when the charger crapped out. A replacement charger is nowhere to be found making a once useful power tool into a somewhat less useful paperweight. I probably wouldn't willingly buy a Kawasaki power tool again. I expect my tools to last longer than a couple years. I guess I should feel fortunate compared to a couple of the other reviewers.
2,"Some good ska, but thats all","This is a budget compilation for Asian Man Records, which for the most part stinks. Some of the ska on this album is pretty good, but a lot of the ska is just too slow for me. The punk on this album does almost nothing for me."
3,"Very good, but not in-depth enough.","I may be 13 years old, but I have been studying Japanese for about 10 months. Yet I already know about 340 kanji, can write kana almost as well as english, and already studied particles from a previous book. The book I previously used was barely in-depth at all. I had so many questions that I couldnt have answers to. So I came on Amazon to look for a better book. I saw this book, read the reviews, and got it.I bought this book about a month ago, and when I first bought it and looked at it I thought it was awesome. However, the more I read in this book, I had more questions than answers. This book covers the basic particles wonderfully and deeply, but it lacks in some details with other particles. Like the difference between ""made"" and ""kiri"" to translate into the word 'just' and so on and so forth. This book is great to begginners, but I dont recommend it to people who want and in-depth study into particles."
1,cant open on windows xp,"I have had this for a few years, it worked on an old computer, but now it wont even open on our computer. I was looking forward to using it again, but cant :("
1,Avoid - will not work with modern computer and laptop systems,I purchased this product a few years ago when I had a Windows 98 system. I am now trying to use the CD Rom but it does not work on the Vista Laptop or the Windows XP laptop. To make matters worse there is no way to contact this company. The contact numbers on the packaging do not work. They do not post up to date contact information anywhere on the internet. Please avoid this product. I note that the product only works on old computer systems.
4,Desolv It Citrus Solution 12.6oz,The first job of removing a fat stain was to my satisfaction. I will look forward to working with the product
5,Glad to find it here-Thanks Amazon!,"Been looking everywhere for this after trying some others and finding out that they did not work. This works so well for greasy, grimy, gummy, sticky issues. Works like nothing else and it is safe and with no harmful fumes. Careful ladies, it will deteriorate your nail polish though so be warned."
5,Best stuff ever,"Mostly I use this prodcut on laundry...it gets out food and grease stains like nothing else, even stains that have been washed before. Sometimes I need to wash the clothes twice to get the citrus smell out but it has saved dozens of clothing items. I also like to use it to remove sicker residue."
2,Not as good as I thought...,"Bought this after reading in a review that it worked great for stainless steel. The reviewer seemed to know plenty of other products I have tried so I assumed that this would be good as well. Note that I have only tried it for cleaning and polishing SS surfaces. Here is what I found:-If the surface is dirty it won't clean it. you have to pre-clean the area with something else first (I used a wet sponge, then dried with a kitchen towel).-It is oil. This leaves a film on the surface that you can see, even worst it gets dirtier faster with fingermarks etc because of the very same oily finish.-It has a pleasant orange smell and supposedly can be used for many other kinds of applications around the house.Although I don't know why anyone wouldn't mind all the oily sheen on everything."
5,Best sticky stuff remover period.,"This is a great product. Made from all natural ingredients. Safe for pets and children. Can be used on almost all surfaces. Smells nice. Variations of this are used in emergency medicine for sticky bandage removal and, it is also used for oil spill clean up.There are a number of other adhesive cleaners out there but this is one of the oldest, best, and environmentally safe options you can use.If peeling a label off slowly fails, I use De-Solv-It on tough label and sales tag adhesive on products I buy like DVDs, CDs, ceramics, etc.This is also an essential tool for flea market, auction house, and thrift store shoppers and sellers."
3,Get crayons off well,It gets the crayon Marking off the wall pretty well u just have to scrub for a long time depending on how bad it is. I had about 2ft x 1ft of markings and it took me about 15 minutes. But the wall looks like it has never been drawn on. And it didn't lose its color. I just don't like to strong orangey scent. As far as getting old grease off the stove nope it didn't work. That's it's a 3 for me.
4,Works fine,"I had a small bottle of similar citrus solution that lasted me many years and did a good job at removing things like decal residue. I've used this product a couple of times and it works OK, nothing miraculous. Most of the sticky residue on glass I take a razor blade and get the majority of it off before I spray some of this on it for a final clean up. Works well with boat registration stickers on fiberglass. It's just handy to have some around."
5,It is as good as they say it is,"I am rather clumsy, so I order it by the case.So far, it has cleaned up every mess I made --on my clothes, on the chairs, everywhere.It is NOT a dangerous chemical -- that is an importantfeature for me."
2,Starman the series,Packaging was poor. Consists of 5 disks in one case. No mention what episodes are in each disk. Not exactally what I expectated
5,Starman - The Complete Series,"The TV programs. Not as good as the movie, but still has watch ability. Same alien new body/guy and instead of a woman companion the alien now has his son as a companion. Not the same good watching as the movie but is still watchable."
4,Not bad for an old series,"Picture quality is not fantastic, but it is probably acceptable considering how old the series is (1986). Only part way through the 5 discs but still enjoying it. Thanks for releasing it on DVD."
3,"Jenny Hayden, Where Art Thou?",I wished they went further with this series.Started off great but then ... nowhere.And what about Jenny Hayden?They should have done a season two and three to STARMAN.
1,Arlene Croce and Bill T. Jones,"Since Arlene Croce critized Bill T. Jones's 'Still/Here' without seeing it, I'll critize her book without reading it. I did read her original attack in the New Yorker.Croce's attack on Jones was rightly received by the dance world with repugnance and disbelief. I'm not surprised to read that she has no background in dance; she is also a shoddy human being.Buying this book puts money in the pocket of a monstrous person and her publisher. Avoid it -- and her -- like the plague."
5,"The absolutely best scent, ever!. Warm and homey, relaxing!","Storm watch candle fragrance, makes me feel so warm and relaxing in my home. My daughter and her boyfriend fall asleep on the couch together on a cold winter day, the fragrance, is enticing. It makes you feel so safe and cozy! (Especially during a storm!) Love the fragrance, can't live most stressful days without it! I hate when Yankee pulls it from its shelf during certain times of the year. So stock up if you fall for this candle. One of Yankees bestcandle!!"
4,Not as good as K but still worth a good listen,This album is not as good as their debut but it still is typical Kula Shaker. They use the Indian influence thoughout the album indirectly in every song. The four members are still very nervous of their instruments and seem to be slightly braging. The album is good to relax to and you can easily focus your mind with the varied tones.
4,"twiddling fodder, the insane toddlers","The Mexican Revolution exists retrospectively as a means by which woman can provide gendered ambiguity to a typically phallicentric hitorical constriveness.Kula Shaker's reenactment of an older, albeit historically validated musical genre act as demystification through conscience immersion into the style without the oppressive irony that practically oozes from other, less capable bands.Music of this nature doesn't warrant overt criticism, but a receptive ear and a unnecessarily large bowl of candy corn."
5,An outstanding tour de force,"Having bought K which I thought was a magical and innovative album, I waited with baited breath for the follow up - and I wasn't disappointed. The amazing way in which traditional Indian music and lyrics are fused with contemporary rock and tremendous guitar riffs is totally unique. Monster tracks like ""Great Hosanna"" and ""SOS"" are perfectly counter balanced by the melodic ""I'm Still Here"" and ""Shower Your Love"". A tremendous CD, I love it - whats next??"
3,average,This paint is not as bad as the flat black and the universal black for some reason. That being said it is just average paint.
4,Beautiful Asian Babes action flick,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is an Asian takeon Charlie's Angels. Non-stop action with a heavy helping of comedy added tothe mix. The women in the film are beautiful with a couple of them being simplystunning. Decent English dubbing job. This film is well worth the VOD rentalprice.
1,Not worth your time,"What sounds better than 5 nice looking babes in a fun Asian action movie? Nothing, that's what. How can you make a movie with 5 nice looking Asian babes so boring? Just ask the makers of this movie!! These folks are so inept they give more screen time to an ugly guy dressed as a woman than the 5 beautiful real girls!! In one big fight scene they have the girls dressed in towels since they were at a spa. Towels?? Where's the tight, skimpy outfits? Preferably in Leather!! And boots!! It's not as if the towels are going to fall off and we'd see something more. This is a PG rated movie. We're not seeing anything more!! Even in a scene where one of the girls is doing a nice dance, the editing is so horrible that the dance is wasted. These girls are nice enough looking where they don't have to keep cutting the film. I stopped after about 45 minutes. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere."
2,Gift,"Book was a gift so I can't review, but my sister-law was happy to get it. I thought it was way over priced for its size!"
4,"a comment for kindle readers, mostly...","I just bought this, in paperback, because the Kindle price is $2.00 higher than the dead-tree edition. I love my Kindle. I much prefer to read on it, unless I'm dealing with a cookbook or a child's picture-book. This price makes no sense whatever, and is annoying. This may make the publisher happy (ha, ha, let's stick it to Kindle), but since I would have bought it for Kindle (this means from you,amazon, not from Safeway)if the price had even been the same, it strikes me as very bad marketing.ok, all that's done. I have just gotten home from the market with my new book, and I'll read it soon. The 4 stars are anticipatory, since I have enjoyed the other books in this series a good deal.Good luck, everyone -- I hope you enjoy this book as much as I expect to. But I'd rather have read it on my Kindle."
3,"The ""Other"" series is definately losing its appeal","I have read all the ""Other"" books in this series. And while, at first it was entertaining getting to know this new world the author created, the last several books have a forced feel about them. Like the author was just trying to get something out there for the publisher. I had a hard time getting into the storyline. There were too many holes. The romance was not believable and the story dragged until the last few pages where the author hurried up to finish it. I think this will be my last ""Other"" book."
2,"Boring with a capital ""B""",I've read several of Christine Warren's Other series books and this one was very disappointing. It had a really interesting story line that I had such high hopes for but I just kept feeling like something was missing from the story that Ms. Warren actually wrote. And don't even get me started on the typos and misused words. I think Ms. Warren needs a new proofreader before her next book comes out. It is extremely distracting from the story when you have to read and reread to try to figure out what the writer meant to say. Love paranormal books with shapeshifters but I would not recommend this one to anyone.
2,Not up to Par with the Others,"As a fan of The Others series, I was really disappointed with this book. It started out great, than just died. I agree with the other reviews, the end did seem rushed. Okay, we know who it is, we know where they are, we ended it. I miss the old books with all the great characters. There seemed to be no heart in this one and if this was the first I had read by her, I probably never would get another."
1,Too Bad...,"I have read all of Christine Warren's books. I was anxiously awaiting her new book. Usually I read her books in one sitting. This book was bad. I can't get past the first chapter. Give me the old books, You're so Vein or the Big Bad Wolf. They were really some great books. Bring back the old characters like Graham Winters or Dima or Misha.I guess I should never have started The Black Dagger series- now they are some real romance stories!!!!"
3,Disappointing,Like many other reviewers I am a fan of the series but was disappointed with this book. It lacked the appeal of the earlier books. I never really came to care about any of the characters and did not find the conflict very interesting. I also was amazed that the price for the Kindle was the same as full price for the paperback. I went out and bought a copy at a discount store. Someone needs to get more realistic in their pricing. I will not plunk down as much for the digital copy as for the paper - it doesn't make sense and I rarely pay full price for the paperbacks anyway.
2,didn't care for it much,"I am a big fan of the ""others"" books..But this book lacked the fire and surprise that the rest of the series has had. It was as if this book was an after thought, just something to make a deadline. The main charactors lacked the spice of previous books. There was no ""tension"" between them, no fire. They fell in love just like that( snap your fingers). They solved the bad guy problem just like that (snap fingers again). I was just very disappointed. I didn't think that Ms. Warren would fall into the pit that other series I have read get into...The pit where they run out of good story lines or repeat them to death. Hopefully the next will be better."
2,Born to Be Mediocre,"This book started out OK, but then devolved into an overly descriptive piece of junk. I don't think I've been more disapointed by what was a really good premise for a supernatural romance medical mystery that, unfortunately, turned into a muddled mess with NO ending -- like someone forgot to include the last chapter, or something!I am horrorifed that I spent 7.99 on this piece of crap. I may never purchase another book by this author again.I did give it two stars because I liked the first half of the story, but the book could have been trimmed almost in half and had a lot better pacing and suspence in the last half of the story.It's almost as if the author had to pump out a larger novel-length story rather than a shorter novella to get paid, which sucked the life out of the story. That's to bad, too, because it was a really good premise for a supernatural suspense/mystery."
4,true value,This is great inexpensive down marker. The pole is entirely padded - not expected and when it is not in use it is 1/2 the height --- also not expected.Awesome!
4,Great telescope,"I am very impressed by this telescope so far, although I haven't spent a lot of time looking at anything beyond a few planets and the moon. The views of Saturn are incredible. I can't believe how well I can make out the rings.The only negatives of this telescope are the size and weight. It is a pain dragging it out of the garage each night."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyed!,"An avid reader of romance with a law enforcement involvement; whether ATF, CIA, DEA, FBI, HSI, or military it does not matter - just love them.Can we say sinister twist of whom the perpetrator is. Who'd thunk it. This book had all points covered - deception, family dynamics, sexy alpha male hero, and a strong woman gets her man.This book was a suspense from the start. When the main charaters meet the romanitic currents were immediate. Neither romance or suspense was lacking, nor did either to back seat to the other. The supporting cast was very entertaining. Eddie and Jada were both comical and sound of reason for the main characters. They both provided support but at the same time made Garrison and Imani face their situations head on - no sugar coating going on here.Bridal shop sceen, what's there to say... go Garrison!"
4,Good Read.,"I liked the book and I love Mrs. Smith.The characters were well development and the suspect was surprising.The thing I didn't care too much for was the romance and the relationship took a backseat to the suspense.I think the book was more about the crime/case than the characters falling in love.When Garrison and Imani were together, CHEMISTY!I wish they would've had more one on one scenes.I won't be rereading the whole book, just their scenes."
5,Palmer's Shea Butter is the best!!!!,"Palmer's Shea Butter is the best. I love the smell, it makes a wonderful lip gloss over semi-permanent lipstick like Max Factor's Lipfinity. Just apply with a lipstick brush. Buy a samll sample one to carry in your puse and a large one to refill the small one."
3,Artistically beautiful....,"however, I am not a big fan of Sr. Mary Keyrouz and her voice is the lead in every Chant on this disk. A bit bland compared to other religious chant CD's on the market. The only reason I gave this CD 3 Stars is because it is accurate in it's presentation of Eastern Rite (Maronite) Chant.I much prefer and would recommend without any reservation whatsoever the CD, ""Chants of the Maronitic Liturgy"" by Prof. Louis Hage and P. Paul Rouhana over this album."
1,this book was so tedious,"I don't think anyone would care about this novel now, if Brooke Shields hadn't starred in the movie version. It's so boring. It feels like something is going to happen any minute, but all of the interesting stuff is in the first 50 pages."
3,Other Books,"A love story about two people that have become totally and completely physically obsessed with each other for long periods of times.It seemed to be a definite favorite of the teenager girl set, at the time. Definitely not your average genre romance novel, anyway, so won't put you off from that point of view."
1,Where's the love story?,"This book is ridiculously overhyped. Instead of telling what would probably be the most interesting part of the story (and the part that would make the rest of the story a little more understandable), the book starts out after Jade and David have broken up and merely chronicles his obsession with her despite all evidence that she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. For all that it's heralded as an honest look at first love, the actual reciprocal love is left out entirely.The hour and a half it took me to read this book would have been better and more enjoyably spent reading the average Harlequin drivel."
1,Gross and disgusting,Following this character around for 400 pages was a trial! He was immature and disturbed. There was not a single compelling or interesting character in the book. The story was flimsy. I took this book on vacation and was very sorry I did.
1,Just another sappy harlequin romance,"This is one of the most immature and pretentious books I have ever read. This book is not about teenage angst, but teenage stupidity. It's so cliched it makes me want to puke. Just a pathetic softcore harlequin romance."
4,Wow,"I had to read this book as an intro to my 20th Century Classics course. I was skeptical about it at first because I find romance novels to be tedious and almost wasteful to me. This novel though... I guess it would have to be a romance novel, but it blew me away. It was scarier than a horror book because it flirts with what is real and what isn't in a relationship - to the extent where I didn't know! For example, an unreal event would occur and then it would suddenly seem not only real but also justified under David's circumstances. But under normal circumstances, one would probably think it would be ludicrous and fake. Spencer's style is amazing and I can't believe this book hasn't received more acclaim. If you have a day or two of free time, this story will be worth your time - I won't forget it anytime soon."
5,Do not die without reading this book,"This book absolutely SLAYS me. I've read it numerous times and it is, in my opinion, a masterpiece of modern fiction. The first sentence reels you in, the last page knocks you dead, and everything in between is so amazing and original, I can't even describe it. Just buy it. By the way, when I first saw a picture of author Scott Spencer, I was astonished that he didn't look a thing like David. But that's how true this book seems.This is NOT light romantic reading for sissies--and I despise that silly new cover--but if you are a bright person with a good vocabulary, do not miss this book."
1,Endless POS,Reading this book is like trying to swim through glue. It's cloying and tedious. And it certainly feels endless - an endless POS.
1,Not what I expected,"I remembered watching this movie years ago, and so I decided to read the novel. Ugh, it was awful! So depressing and sad. Not nearly as much of a love story as I thought it would be. I forced myself to finish the book, so that I could form a complete opinion. Not one I would recommend!"
5,"Haunting, memorable","This story is absolutely fantastic. I read this book years ago and was struck by the beauty of the writing and how intense the story is. Still one of my favorites, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a darker look at love and the things it can make us do."
2,Not That Great,"I don't understand why so many people loved this novel so much. It is interesting until about the middle, then it starts to get more boring. The sex scenes are boring and unoriginal, and I don't see why David is supposed to be ""innocent"", when he is clearly disturbed."
5,great quick read if you like irvine welsh,"just going to be brief, but i thought this was an enjoyable quick read about two kidnappers and the guy they kidnap and his gf. its like welsh's other novels where it has some very funny parts but at other times has some very deep serious portions.some of it might seem to be a bit of a stretch, but hey it is fiction, it'd probably be interesting to actually see on stage.so if you like welsh i suggest readin this. or if you havent this might be a good starter read."
2,"Great author, failed play...","I'm a huge fan of Welsh's other books, but his characters don't translate well here. He's got a leg up in that the three main characters should all be familiar to Welsh fans, so minimal effort is needed to flesh them out, but in the end the notion that they somehow find love is so far-fetched that I thought it was a joke at first. Imagine Frank Begbie from 'Trainspotting' going soft over a bird and suddenly wanting to escape his violent and nihlistic life (all within the span of two or three pages) and you've got the essential problem I had with this play. The introduction by Welsh is actually the best part.You get the feeling that the lost production costs are being recouped through the sale of this screenplay. Buy ""Ecstasy"" or ""The Acid House"" instead."
3,Quite Good only. Not as good as I expected.,"I must say track 2 and 6 in this album are very good meditation music . But apart from these two tracks, the others don't seem to encourage meditation. Some are too distracting while some tracks even performed by annoying flutes or vocals. They don't make the soul retreat to calm. In this album, you'll find only around 20 minutes music really suitable for meditation."
2,And then what?,"This 22 page book takes brevity to a science. Although it nicely describes SI, it falls short of providing suggestions for improving SI. ""While not a therapist, a teacher can do many activities within the classroom to meet the sensory needs of her students in general."" This is as specific as the book gets."
4,Very good but from 1974,"This is a book about traditional Japanese architecture of private houses. The book was originally written in Japanese in 1974 so it is a bit dated. If you want a 200 page introduction in a serious manner (but without being written for architects) you should buy this book. The approach is somewhat anthropological, i.e. to understand how the houses actually were used and designed. The main drawback is that the photos are in black and white.Don't buy this book if you're interested in interior design."
2,More Educational than decorative use,"Bought the book thinking it would show ideas on how to decorate with Japanese furniture and art. All the pictures are in Black and White. Gives more information on ""What a Japanese house is"", then decorating ideas."
1,The Inner Harmony of the Japanese House,"Badly written, disorganized, minimally illustrated, far less poetic than the subject matter. More historical than harmonious."
3,Very good but got the wrong color,"I bought this item as a gift for my wife when I got it I didn't even consider looking in the box before handing it to her, once she opened it she was really happy with it and I liked it a lot as well but unfortunately I was disappointed in regards to the color because I requested the white & black but got the white & blue and I cant send it back as I live overseas other than that all was really good"
3,Goddard Puts Me On Edge,"Wayne Goddard is probably one of the top 10 hand-made knife makers in the United States. This book, however, was a somewhat disappointing rehash of his BLADE magazine articles of past years. There are sections of the book which are repeated verbatim on more than one page, and the disjointed collection of old articles is somewhat difficult to follow at times. On the other hand, the information that is presented clearly is very useful if the reader is interested solely in blade forging, as the stock removal method is almost entirely dismissed. Included is an excellent dissertation on the chemestry of steel."
3,"It's good, but I heard it before.","A ""Best Of----"" album is a risky business, face it we have all heard itbefore. This does not deminish the music, and I guess those who were notpaying attention for part or all of the Lamont Cranston Band's career,its a make up test. The choice is...o.k., but what you are reallymissing is what the CD does not have on it. This CD could have donejustice to being a double CD, there is at least two CD's worth of justoutstanding music. It does amuse me that this CD, being out of print,commands such a unbelievable price. I mean common, its just a CD, andfor you do it yourselfers, their are plenty of still in their shrinkwrap Waterhous 6 LP's out there for a reasonable price that you canput on a CD if you have the CD recorder, and produce your own. But forsome of you I know I lost you at do it yourself. But for the ruggedpioneer type, why let some one dictate to you?"
3,I didn't find the book that useful,"I recently purchased Tim Kirkwoods Flight Attendants Job Finder and Career Guide. I didn't find the book that useful. First of all, alot of the airport codes are not in the book and the addresses for the airlines that are supposingly hiring are incorrect or no longer in business.I feel that I really didn't gain by purchasing this book. My advise to anyone thinking of purchasing the book...........maybe you should reconsider."
3,Informative Guide with Online Updates,"Review for the 77th Anniversary EditionSince this book was written back in 2002, it is probably due for a major update, but the main information will still be helpful to anyone looking for a career as a Flight Attendant due to the online updates for the second half of the book listing airlines.The first part of the book introduces a history section, information on minimum requirements, education needed, work experience and career benefits. They also explore types of airlines, corporate flying and the application process. Training, Flight Scheduling and a typical three-day trip is also featured.This book should serve as a good introductionto this industry and give you ideas aboutwhich company you may want to work for.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Flight Attendant Job Finder & Career Guide,This book is not worth any amount of money. A much better buy is The Essential Guide To Becoming A Flight Attendant by Kiki Ward. She has answered any and every question one may have about any part of the resume/interview process with questions as well as answers on how to answer those questions! Tim Kirkwood's book was useless...not enough information with a much too broad spectrum. Trust me...buy Kiki Ward's book - you won't be disappointed!
1,Very Late,Still haven't received the poster after almost 3 weeks. Will not be ordering from here again. Sent an email and hasn't been responded to yet.
1,Learn to walk before you run,"The author tries to write a book that is the be-all and end-all of SP books. By trying to cover both analog and discrete signals all at once, he succeeds only in confusing the reader. Even if he had only tried to cover one of the topics, I'm not sure he would have succeeded. Examples are few and far between - not to mention difficult to follow. Sometimes, he makes reference to equations that have been derived textually and are hidden somewhere in an obscure paragraph. This book could have been much better written. I didn't like it."
2,An average quality text,"I used this book in school, and recently (after several years out of school) tried to use it as a reference to re-learn DSP. What a nightmare; the author has chosen to use a format that I would describe more as an abstract than a book. As a text in a college course, this book was mediocre, as a reference it is poor. I eventually gave up and purchased Richard G. Lyons book Understanding Digital Signal Processing, which is an absolutely outstanding example of how a book ought to be written."
2,This book is not exactly the best of the genre.,This book is definitely not one of the best books I have ever seen to tackle this subject. Many of the derivations are extremely difficult to follow due to the format in which the equations are presented. Also the example problems that are given seem to take the most difficult case instead of a simpler one that could more easily illustrate what is to be learned.
1,Worst required text I have ever had,Lousy and sad for a 2nd edition. Examples are few and far between despite other reviewer's comments. Our professor has been kind enough to keep a log of the errors students have identified. There is a solutions manual for this but many of the answers contain errors as well. The only purpose for choosing this book is it covers both Continuous and Discrete analysis. This book will not even be a good reference later so hopefully I can find someone to take it off my hands.
2,There must be a better book somewhere for Signals and System,"This book isn't a very easy read. I just took a graduate level class which utilized this book, and I and my class mates agree it isn't very easy to follow. Signals and Systems analysis involves some pretty complex material and this book seemed to speed through these complex topics a little to quickly. There weren't enough examples and the examples that were in the book, often bore little resemblance to the homework questions. Bottom line this shouldn't be a one semester (or quarter in my case) course and until university administraters realize this, books like this will continue to be the norm."
3,Not the Best Book and Needs Solution Manual,"Not the Best Book and Needs Solution Manual, can't find one anywhere and it would make there teaching much better."
1,Not very helpful,This book is very subpar. I have found that the examples and explanations are not very helpful. The only way I could do any of the problems was due to my professors. But even then I found the problems to be poorly written and confusing. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the book seems mostly error free and it is not completely worthless but it is getting there. And why does a 3 inch floppy come included in the book??? My 10 year old computer does not even have a floppy drive! And the book is only a year older than my computer. It probably wouldn't even run on Windows XP. Now that I am thinking about it I am changing my rating from a 2 to a 1 star just because it comes with a floppy.
1,Buy this for firewood only,Worst written book I have used in any of my EE courses. I am a graduating senior and intend on spending the rest of my life finding this author. This is a prime display of an author trying to show how smart he is. You are only smart if you can teach someone else what you know. No solution manual makes double checking your answers impossible.
5,Excellent student oriented text,The author walks you through the material one small step at at a time.This text is as close to painless learning as learning wil ever get (if I may be forgiven a colloquilism). You don't need answers in the back because he works several examples for you on every page.If I ever had to teach this I would use this book.
4,The Conquest of the Last Maya Kingdom,"Dr. Grant Jones's book The Conquest of the Last Maya Kingdom is an excellently researched and well written piece. I had the pleasure of taking a course from Dr. Jones in which this book was used and I think that its primary strength is that it is entertaining and gripping as well as informative and educational. If you are interested in Mesoamerican history, you must read this book."
2,dry as dust,"I can hardly believe that some of the other reviewers were reading the same book I was. I read a lot of history, and a lot on the Mayans, and was drooling over this book. But reading it was painful - it is SO dry, SO academic, that despite repeated attempts to continue I finally gave up on it."
4,Wonderfully relaxing and nostalgic,"What a great album for dinner parties, quiet evenings by yourself or with a special 'some one'. Not 'Musak'. Takes you back to when having a drink and dinner was what we envisioned with a cold martini, lovely setting and warm music.Almost anyone who wishes the '50s and 60's' were back will enjoy the CD. Great for practicing those lovely, slow dances."
3,Good for beginners,"I bought this about a month ago, because it says it was for beginners, but after about 2 or 3 weeks it was not longer effective.. Not bragging about myself, i'm mediocre at best, but the racket is just too heavy for me."
3,A Treat For Teens,"What an enjoyable romp this book is! When a 15-year old video game whiz begins to control the outcome of major sports events via his computer, anything can happen-and DOES!Fame and riches are his, to be sure, but so is extreme peril, as he turns the gambling world upside down. Targeted by the mafia, the main character, Brady, must save himself, his friends, his new-found fortune, and his future.Author Shirley Babcock laces this imaginative tale with pop culture and humor to provide the reader witha delightful read and a satisfying conclusion."
3,Practical guide,"The book covers a comprehensive aspect of everyday modelling requirements for practitioners. Since it is very dependent on Excel spreadsheet for all the modelling, having the sample template of the chapters on your PC will help a lot. Unfortunately, the CD that comes with the book cannot be install into my PC that runs on WinXP. Error message of not enough disk space will come up upon installation (my PC has 8G of free space)......sad. Hope the publisher will come up with a patch for the CD."
5,The Other Side (Probably New for You),"As desperate military conflicts fade into the past, it becomes (socially) more possible for each side to consider what the situation looked like to the erstwhile enemy (of course, there are always those who wish to perpetuate wars, for whom anyone once CONSIDERED an enemy must always BE an enemy - these are the vultures of war, and they DO feed on wars).Kristallnacht wasn't a military conflict, of course, but it BECAME (see Vultures above) part of the run-up to a monumental conflict - indeed, part of the CAUSES for said conflict. This conflict, beginning less than a year after Kristallnacht, has grossly distorted historical understanding of the incident, for people on both sides.Weikert tries to view the matter without the occluding ""hindsight"" that World War II has long enshrouded the subject in. Her attempt is very valuable, and provides a quantum leap from wartime propaganda toward . . . the truth."
5,Truth not Story,"It's a very truly and realistic book that shows us that most of history writers tell things nothing to do with reality, just to defend interests of a little range of people. In this book you will find just facts not lies about World War II and who begins with it."
3,Works but I've seen better,"I've had mine for 3 months now, bought from Amazon. For mine, the temperature holds pretty well. I've used it for cold and hot liquids, and when it is kept full will keep the liquid hot or cold for about a day or so. Not as good as my tiger but still way better than other generic brands I've seen.Three bad things though... part of the metal edge that wraps the cylinder is starting to rust ever so slightly and I had put in this horrid smelling tea one time and now the smell has seemed to stuck around after countless cleanings, also the spout is quite small so it takes a while to fill your cup. This one is made in China... Doesn't compare to my Tiger.I think the design is cute though."
5,Amazing how a young child can see the good and bad people,"Harper Lee has created a perfect narrator, an young innocent child, who is very believable. the innocent and naive manner which Scout reports in gives the novel an added level on enjoyment and meaning. Her courage and stubborness is an assest to her, and we see how courages she is when she stands up to Tom Robinson's lynch squad. Living with such a man as her father who is a high principled lawyer, has meant that Scout has no prejudical thoughts at all, she takes everyone for who they are, not what they are. Over all, I found this a wonderful book in which everyone could take some thing away from. the underlying messages were simlpe but powerful and wonderful effort from Harper lee."
1,Shallow,"This is a book clearly oriented to the backpacker, but so much so that it neglects more peripheral areas or upscale areas that a backpacker may occasionally be interested in. Its attention to nightlife, one of the more enjoyable aspects of Thailand, is dismal. There is a political correctness strewn througout the book, to the point of completely omitting major locales and activities, that is distressing. Thailand is not a politically correct country by any stretch of the imagination, but it is what it is, and as such is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable places on earth. The Moon Handbook, Lonely Planet and Footprint are far more complete and helpful."
4,useful but not practical,These are great for beverages you don't water down...but I find them odd to clean... Ice cubes are definitely easier but these are good for the right occasion...
2,Quality... mmmmm,Not nice quality and the freeze they provide has nothing to do with real ice.. I wish i would have not bot them... eventhough the low price..
2,Gone after 2 hours,The only advantage of this product is its ability to be reused at least several times. They do hold the cold but only for about 2 hours (in a cooler that is). Good for a price.
2,ok,These cubes were great at first but now after a few months of using them they give a funny taste. Oh and yes they were washed after EVERY use.
1,Eh,"Sounds like a great idea, but really didnt keep my drink cold. Cool, yes, but cold.... No.After the first few days I stopped using them."
2,Basically plastic cubes,"These plastic ""ice"" cubes just don't work, period. They're cold in your hand, but when you put it in your drink, they don't make a difference at all. The only thing they actually do is end up making my drink taste a bit plastic-y, even after washing them many, many times. I got these to use when we ran out of ice, but I just ended up throwing them out."
2,Not what I expected,"This is not at all what I expected. First of all, they water down pretty quickly. Like in less than 15 minutes and I live in NY so the weather is not hot at all at this time of year. Second, I don't think they cool drinks as fast as real ice. In fact, they don't cool it that much. The colors and design I liked, but overall, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Blah,"These things don't stay cold for more than a few minutes. Stick to ice cubes.Also, once you get them out it's hard to maneuver them back into place to get the lid back on."
3,SOME LEAKED TO QUICKLY.,"I LOVE DUNKIN DONUTS ICE COFFE BUT HATE IT WATERED DOWN WITH ICE, I GOT HOOKED ON THE PLASTIC ICE CUBES THIS PAST SUMMER WHEN WALGREENS HAD A BUCKET OF 10 fruit designs for 2 bucks. THE LASTED BUT WOULD LOOSE A COUPLE WHILE TRYING TO WASH THEM ECT. SO I HAD BOUGT LIKE 5 MORE. UNTIL SUMMER WAS OVER AND THEY HAD NO MORE, SO WHEN I WAS DOWN TO A FEW LEFT I HOPED PN AMAZON, I PICKED THESE BASED ON PRICE AND QUANTITY,ALSO RATINGS. WITHIN A WEEK FOUR HAD LEAKED, BUT THE REST ARE HOLDING UP, THERE ALSO BIGGER AND EASIER TO CLEAN, I WILL BUY MORE HOPING TO GET NO LEAKERS!"
2,Concerned about the safety after using a few times,"Our new fridge doesn't have an ice maker so we thought we would like these better than ice cube trays. I looked for a while to find some of these that stated that they were BPA free, but I could find any from any brand online.First we used them with only water, and the first two times we thought they were fine. We washed them by hand after each use. Then they got used with soda and washed by hand. Shortly after that my family said they wouldn't use them anymore. They either tasted like the last beverage or they tasted like plastic.I'm worried now that the plastic is breaking down for whatever reason and leaching into the drinks. So I trashed them."
1,Try something else,"These don't really seem to get very cold, so I'm a little disappointed with the purchase. They are, however, a pretty shade of blue."
3,Iced Tea / Coffee - Could be better,"When making iced tea or coffee (from my Keuirg coffee maker) the ice cubes melt too fast, and arn't able to completely ""ice"" the drink. However, it's better than the drink getting totally watered down."
5,As good as the first Live and More.,"The queen of disco is back, and is better than ever before. Donna Summer sounds as good as she did during the glory days of disco. Thumbs up!!"
3,DONNA IS 5 STARS BUT,"My only complaint is that the other songs like the SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME, RIDING THROUGH THE STORM, IF THERE IS MUSIC THERE, I DON'T WANNA WORK, AND NOBODY, were left off. So really this is LIVE AND LESS ENCORE! I guess once more Sony thinks that the fans only want to hear her back catalogue of hits rather than new ones, whitch to me, are my most favorites that she does live. At least an edited shorter live version of MY LIFE is on there. Hmm guess they know what we want to hear. Whatever. Buy the DVD so you can have all of the LIVE AND MORE ENCORE instead of the one that is LESS. At least the 2 new studio songs are a plus."
5,Her biggest hits live.,"This album is very good, I think that every music lover or collector should have it. Donna Summer is a piece of music history and VH1 had this good idea to release her hits in a different way.""Live and more"" has big hits from the 70's and 80's, historical songs like ""On the radio"", ""She works hard for the money"", ""Last dance"" and ""Hot stuff"".The production is very good, her hit with Barbra S. this time was performed by one of the most famous singers from Australia, the great Tina Arena (I think that I don't need to say that that song was ""No more tears""). Donna also recorded 3 new songs for this album which are ""My life"", ""Love is the healer"" and the 1999 hit ""I will go with you"".Other great songs in this album are ""MarcArthur park"", ""This time I know it's for real"" and ""Dim all the lights""."
4,How Could They Omit the Best Song from the Show?,"In the middle of this fun show, Summer introduced a song that is part of a musical she is writing for Broadway.""If There Is Music There"" is an amazing song of admitting that music must come first if you wish to sing it. Summer's voice and overall performance rocked and it is NOT on the CD. It is on the video but. . .If anyone knows how to get this song on disc, let the site know.Thanks!"
4,Excellent Live CD!,"If you like live CDs, this is one you need to get. It is amazing how well the songs sound like the originals. Donna Summer's voice sounds better than it ever has. Enjoy it!"
3,"""Con Te Partiro"" = ""Say Goodbye""","This new cd is great and the concert was awesome. I saw Donna three weeks ago at Kiss (108 FM) Concert 20 and she came on as the surprise guest at the end. She did a great job and looked as good then as she did in the past! I was really excited to hear some of her newer disco and pop songs... but when I heard ""Con Te Partiro"" I was a little disappointed. No Sarah Brightman is she, so therefore it would be a longshot for this song to be as good as the original. Although it is a great dance song, I thought she could do a little better and come up with a ""new"" song that she can claim as her own. Overall, great album and a perfect time for her to get back into the spotlight."
2,"Where is ""Dinner with Gershwin""?Where is ""Love to Love You""?","These songs with a few noticeable exceptions are pretty obligatory for a performance to a national television audience, but where is the smash that-in my opinion-is the best of her career, ""Dinner with Gershwin""?This Brenda Russel gem was a smash for Donna in 87 and was one of her last. I think we should be entitled to hear this live. I know this is not a Greatest Hits Album, but it is purporting to be one in that it is supposed to presage a regular comeback album and function as a retropective before Donna attempts a comeback a a la Cher or Diana Ross. One would think that an entire album of Hex Hector material is the next thing on her agenda given the success of Diana Ross' ""Until we Meet Again"" and her up and coming smash , ""Con Te Partiro""...."
2,Comeback?,"I grew up in the 70s. Donna Summer was a great talent and her work (most of it) still holds up. Unfortunately, this is little more than a rehashing of old hits, I suppose in a new ""live"" format. Hype at it's best. The performances are good enough but add little to the material. The new songs are mediocre. Better to have either done ""No More Tears"" as a solo, or left it out. This Tina Arena is no Barbra Streisand.Note to Donna: Learn from Tina Turner. Give us a fresh new album of songs that highlight your best talents. We already own one of the many greatest hits collections."
2,Same Ole same ole,"Not that there is much bad with the cd but there is little new..... for a ""comeback"" with only 3 new songs I will wait for a NEW album before I rave"
5,"Bravo, applause! applause! for Ms. Summer",The music was great! A true work of art. I loved it. This artist gets better with age. Excellent. It let's dance all over again just better. Truly the best CD I have purchased in a long time. Excellent.
2,Ok- An extra star because it looked nice on the counter...,"Isn't this a cute and stylish timer? That's what I thought when I bought it...but as a timer it's useless. The buzzer is so faint and short, that you have to be standing nearby in the kitchen to hear it. Tonight I burned what would have been a wonderful pie because I was in another room when this weak buzzer sounded-and I didn't hear a thing.I've had it! I've just ordered the Oregon Scientific digital timer to replace this cheap thing."
1,Piece of junk,"It took me a good long time to check through all the reviews of minute timers, to find one above 2 stars. This one had a few success stories, so I went with it. Not the cheapest, not the most expensive either. It does not work for short timings. It stops ticking. Yes, I turned it past 45 minutes, then back down to 5. They don't make them like they used to."
5,Short ring but reliable,"had a previous one for 14 years, before breaking after its thousandth drop. Loud but short ring, and great if you hate the microwave timers. Price was great and i cant believe they even make these anymore!"
1,Miss Print,"ordered 3 sets of 3 for a total of 9. Sent me three. I called & I was told they made a mistake, the price was for a single dish. MISS PRINT. Called them & told them that I was going to report them to Amazon. They sent me a check for $20.00"
2,useful height is only 1 inch,"I ordered this item instead of the Le Creuset Petite Au Gratin primarily because a reviewer of that product called it ""uselessly shallow."" This item claims a depth of 3.5 inches (which would be much too deep), but in actuality it is only 1 inch deep.(1.5 would be ideal.) Even if you measure from the bottom of the dish to the top of the handles (a truly useless measurement) you only get 2.5 inches. Also, one of the three (why three?) had a big chip missing from a top edge, and the chip was nowhere to be found in the packaging - which tells me it went into the box chipped. I wish I could send these back, but I'm sure I'll find a use for them. I'm ordering my first choice which couldn't be any more ""uselessly shallow"" than these."
2,Too shallow,"Wish we'd read the reviews before purchasing. Yes, these dishes are shallow. The specifications on the purchase page were 10.5"" long (actual 10"") x 3.5"" deep (actual 1.125"") x 6"" wide (actual 5.5""). Disappointed because the depth was important to us."
1,RCA = junk,"As a longtime RCA customer I am very saddened to say that RCA now makes garbage look like gold. RCA's crummy electronics only rivals their non-existant service. No excuse for making an item this poor. This TV in particular is very poor quality because RCA farms out all of their electronics to many different companies (there isn't evan an ""RCA"" company any more, just a trademark). The TV died after less than a year which is about as long as most RCA produts last these days."
1,trash,"garbage, does this guy get any worse? o yea dont believe ja rule fans? just cuz i dont like 50 cent means im a ja rule fan? STFU! 50 is garbage and thinks hes better than nas and the game. get outta here with that love songs bs."
4,Well made cups,I use these to give my 83 year old mother drinks. They are semi-transparent so I can see how much water is going to her lips so I don't accidentally choke her.They are gentle against her lips.They are a light green shade. If they were clear I would have given them 5 stars.
5,Perfect for Lewy Body patients,My Mom had Lewy Body Dementia and had big issues with swallowing. These cups were a godsend in helping her get enough fluids that were thickened.
4,Use for nosey cups,My husband has Parkinsonism and difficullty putting his head back far enough to finish his drink. This is a big help. I would also recommend it for anyone with neck problems.
1,Not as good as previous versions,"Being a school teacher I use my white board all the time, and these erasers are not very good. EXPO used to make erasers that were much better! These leave ""ghosts"" on the white board, don't clean dark colors very well and need to be constantly cleaned. With the old eraser I would clean my white board every other week. With these, I have to clean it every other day! I'm still on the lookout for a good eraser that will stand up to heavy duty use."
5,I love this book/,"Great Seller, I highly recommend to buy this book and other items. I lost this book several years ago and I am happy to have it again thanks to Amazon."
4,TANGy!!,"Wu-Tang is awesome because these guys are purists. They aren't even hip hop. These guys are RAP. Pure, unadulterated rhyme laid over heavy beats, and RZA knows how to pick them. This album is a good selection of licks that are the roots of what hip hop is today. If you want to understand the origin of hip hop music, then you should introduce yourself to the Wu."
5,real classic joints,"This is a phat collection of the Wu's hits. Its got the signature tracks from Meth, Ol' Dirty, GZA, Rae, and Ghost, as well as tracks from the whole clan. I felt that ""Triumph"" from the Wu's double CD would've made this the definitive collection, but its tight the way it is. Well worth the money for any hip-hop fan."
4,Expensive but convenient,Gives about a 50% boost to battery life without needing to carry spares. Replaces the optical drive which I find I rarely need on the road. Somewhat expensive.
1,Don't Buy!,"Your Thinkpad will always *completely* drain the Ultrabay battery before going to the primary battery. This will dramatically reduce the lifespan of the battery. My Ultrabay battery dropped to 30% capacity within 4 months, replaced it on warranty, and now is at 50% capacity."
1,Misleading search result,"Beware! Amazon returns this page when one searches for Lenovo 57Y4536 battery. However, IBM 08K8190 is not a replacement for Lenovo 57Y4536. So, it will not work with Lenovo T400 series. I learned about this hard way. The battery I ordered goes to trash, and my trust in Amazon is severely diminished."
2,Not useful.,The ultrabay battery is always used first before using the external one and it is only 3-cell battery.
2,Good try - keep trying,"Nice bright light, but after about 5 minutes it cycles off for a few minutes, probably due to over heating. For over $50, I expected much better. Beware.Would I buy it again? Nope."
4,Pacific Grace,"This was my first New Age/ Relaxation CD, and it started a strong loyalty to both the Somerset Entertainment and Solitudes lines. I listen to this CD for a myriad of reasons: to help me fall asleep, when I want to concentrate, even when I just want to pretend I'm somewhere else for a while. The melodies are beautifully written (the piano solo in the first song, also called ""Pacific Grace"", is very dreamy; I've been trying to master it on the piano myself!), and the sounds of ocean waves, seals, birds, frogs, and, of course, orcas are masterfully sprinkled throughout and make a one-of-a-kind experience. The orca sounds were collected by the research scientist who penned the forward on the CD cover, so you know they are authentic. I almost feel like I've been transported to the Washington State coast! I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves wildlife, new age music, or wants a new experience with his/her music."
2,Self-Indulgence at its best..,"As an aspiring rockabilly player, I ordered this DVD with high hopes.. Oh Boy! was I DISSAPOINTED..All Mr. Weider does on the DVD is show the viewer how good and fast HE can play.. SELF-INDULGENT clap-trap.He makes no attempt to break down the licks like other teachers do.. ABsolutely no teaching on his part, whatsoever...If u actaully want to LEARN rockabilly guitar, dont buy this DVD... Complete waste.."
2,Could have been better,"We were expecting No More Water in the Tub and No More Jumping on the Bed to be as funny and Arnold's Parts and More Parts, but they aren't. They average stories that are entertaining for a read or 2, but we have gone back to Parts and More Parts which make us laugh everytime."
2,No More Water in the Tub,No More Water in the Tub is a story about 2 boys named William and Walter. The faucet broke on their tub so there was a flood in the apartment. William went through the apartment. Also there was a fire and it was put out with the flood. So he got a medal. I wouldn't recommend it to a 3rd or 4th grade friend because it is boring but I would read it to my little brother he is in kindergarten.
3,No More Water In The Tub,"No More Water In The Tub takes place in an apartment building. First, William's mom told him to not put much water in the tub. Second, the tub got filled with water and it overflowed. Then, William and Walter went sailing through the whole apartment building into other apartments. Finally, William was a hero because he made a fire go out in the bottom floor apartment with the water from the tub. This is a very funny book. I was laughing so hard."
3,No More Water in the Tub,"No More Water in the Tub is based on a story that occurs in a bathtub. First, Walter accidentally unscrewed the knob off the tub. Second, the tub broke loose and raced down the stairs of the apartment building. Finally,William's tub water put out a fire on the bottom floor. I felt surprised that the bathtub broke loose. I think my brothers and sister would like this story."
5,Deal or no deal?,Got it as a gift for a friend. GREAT SERVICE! Got it in 3 days. Havent tested it out yet tho. Happy hunting!
2,broke the first time my friend used it,"I bought it as a dredging hook, for which it was well suited. However, my friend borrowed it to climb a building, and it broke the first time he used it."
3,ok for kids.,"bought this for kids to climb small walls. Wouldn't put much more than 100lbs weight on it. Rops is only, not quality climbing rope. Wouldn't buy again for $19. $10-15 is more like it."
5,Tree Trimming with a Grappling Hook,"I bought the Grappling Hook with the idea of using it to snag tree limbs and branches that I cut down on a hillside on my property. The incline of the hill is very steep and difficult to walk on. A pole pruner allows me to reach out over the hillside to cut the branches then, I snag them and pull them up the hill to dispose of properly. The combination of the Grapple Hook and the pruner makes short work of an otherwise tiring project. The Hook is very rugged and performs perfectly. I strongly recommend this product in this type of application."
2,Came in poor condition,"The item was a joke-gift for the holidays. it came with a useless rope and in poor condition. As it was a joke and very cheap, I have no real complaints."
4,Dope,i have had real fun injuring me and my friends and a car is not good with roller blades using this hook. yo.
1,Caution!,this broke the first time i used it. im only 190 pounds. the part where the hooks screw in broke right off. if i had the resources i would sue the maker of this product because i hurt myself. this is a piece of junk. i bought mine from a martial art website. the one i got came with a black nylon rope which is impossible to climb. i replaced that with a manila rope. i caution all who buy this and use it to be very careful.
1,weak metal,"This item looked really cool, my kids were very excited to use it. Then when I got it together, the hooks bent the first time it was used. Very disappointed."
3,Not for Climbing...,...but not bad for a small cheap anchor or for grabbing hold of debris to pull it clear searching for IED's. Dump the rope and use 550 parachute cord. It will also pull down barbed wire from the top of a wall or you can use it to open a gate without exposing yourself. Don't try hooking it up to a vehicle though cuz then it will come apart. It folds to make a nice flat package but it definitely ain't a SMALL package!
5,grapling hook,"We orderd this product to help remove lake weeds. It works great for that, It is well made and Im sure ninjas will be impressed with it."
2,Good for a Laugh,"Fun to mess about with something like this, except if you're caught climbing around at night, police will classify this as a burglary tool, and a weapon. The rope is much too thin to climb, so this has almost no practical use. Only good as a decoration, or costume piece for halloween."
3,Ninja Grappling Hook,This is OK for use in tree cutting although I did bend one of the tines on it. But I wouldn't bet my life on it for rappeling. But for the price it is OK.
3,Just cool,"This is definitely cool, something Stewie Griffin would possess in his box of things. I want one but I'm certain it wont hold my 300lbs of big bones and muscle. LOL. For the price I wouldn't risk anyone's life with it."
3,Ninja Hook,I used this hook about 10 times snagging beaver cuttings from my pond. It worked great! The rope is tangle free too.However when I encountered a clump of bull rush roots it did hook it firmly but when I retreived the hook it was bent at the joining bolt. I since welded them together thus eliminating the colapsing feature. I haven't had any problems since.I would be pressed to say that it would not bend it you tried to scale a wall though.
3,"nothing ""folding"" about it","Kool sturdy hook - simply bolts together - doesn't ""fold up"" at all. Great for taking down or climbing . Black rope was kool surprise..."
1,WARNING!,"Take note, kiddies: mine *broke*. Luckily, it did not break completely mid-climb, but had cracked most of the way through under about 180 pounds of weight--enough that afterward it fell apart very easily. Although above it says ""rated for 800 pounds,"" another seller says ""not for climbing.""If you really want to be an urban ninja, get a real grappling hook from a mountain climbing supply store."
3,it'll do the job,the grappling hook works pretty well but the rope is worthless for climbing. definitely need some true climbing rope to tie on
1,Grapple my ass,"I bought this thing to grapple junk out of my pond, and also to do ninja stuff. The first thing I grappled was a piece of plastic snow fence about 6' long. The hook broke. Thankfully I wasn't trying to scale any walls or whatever, because this thing is garbage."
5,"For the frugal, urban crimefighter","My experience with the product is limited to about 3 weeks of fairly intense use. I ordered this as a vital component of my ninja training, and it arrived rapidly and in discreet packaging. So far it has proven to be fairly sturdy and reliable. Build quality is good and is has held up well under regular use, though I would not place more than 200 lbs of load on the provided rope. I have used this to scale all sorts of urban environments in security and stealth, and the collapsible nature of the product allows it to fit comfortably on my utility belt. Once my training is complete, I fully expect this will be an invaluable piece of equipment in my one man crusade against crime. Evildoers beware!"
2,A disappointing Hammer Film,"I had read some good things about this early Hammer Film, but I was ultimately disappointed by it. There isn't much in the way of menace, and the story of an ugly, but good Dr. Jekyll turning into a handsome, but violent Mr. Hyde never really takes off. Most of the plot is taken up with a rather unbelievable affair between Dr. Jekyll's wife and his best friend (played by Christopher Lee). There are far better Hammer Films available. Even from the same year as this film 1960, both ""The Brides of Dracula"" and ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" are sure to strike your fancy."
3,"Calling these ""Seasons"" is a bit misleading.","While the information within these clips is good, they really are just ""clips"". . . not episodes. The ""First Season"" has 6 ""episodes"" that TOGETHER make around 25 minutes of content. Said another way, the first ""season"" is less than the length of a single episode of a TV show. To give you an example of the pacing of these episodes, the 2nd one from the first season only teaches how to play a one chord.Apart from being short, the reason this content is free is because it advertises a website that teaches guitar.That said, if you're just starting out, you'll definitely get some good information here. Just don't expect it to be a replacement for a more robust training program. I give it 3 stars because it's more of an advertisement for a website, but the content (though paltry) is useful and the price is right.Bottom line: You'll learn something if you're just starting out - but you certainly shouldn't pay for something like this."
2,Extremely remedial,"If guitar had on/odd switch that would have been 1st lesson. Did not seem like this presented much, help for tuning would gave been nice. I guess this was a ""teaser""? It was FREE so I paid what it was worth."
2,to hard,did not under stand and some times it would no play on my computer. I really don't have anything more to say
4,a melting pot of roots influences,"First rule of thumb: it's on Bloodshot Records, it must be good. This is the second release from Devil in a Woodpile, a Chicago-based roots outfit. They lace ragtime, jazz, blues, and all kinds of roots influences into their sound. My only complaint would be that the lead vocals are a bit flat. Otherwise, this is a fun cd."
4,Takes a little getting used to...,"I really like this disc, but it took some time. Initially I had a problem with the vocals. They are deep and, if not listened to carefully, can seem droning. The instrumentation is really nice, and quite novel with a tuba and washboard giving an old-timey kind of feel. The songs are real catchy, and once I began hearing the subtlety of the singing, I was able to really enjoy these guys."
4,Mikasa Olympus,"I recently purchased Mikasa Olympus Cordials from Amazon.com and received them quickly and in excellent unscuffed condition. The pieces are beautiful and I have entire settings for the Martini's, Brandy's, Cordials, Goblet Platinum, Wine Platinum, Fluted Champagne Platinum, and Water Goblet Platinum. They feel solid in the hand (heavy.) I have never broken one but when purchasing from others I regularly find chips on the lip or foot, as well scuffs. That's one of the reasons I was very happy to find the one's I ordered from Amazon in perfect condition."
4,"Sure, there are black jews","From the many captivities of the Jewish people, there are Jews of nearly every ethnic group. Solomon's liaisons with 1000 women of various nations, as well as Balaam's suggestion to the enemy king to have his army sleep with the temple prostitutes, would render mixed Jews from every corner of the world. Jews have been captive to many nations including Persia, Egypt, Italy (Rome), etc. under rulers such as Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, various Pharoahs, and Caesars. Furthermore, Abraham (father of the Jewish people) was never white. He was called away from his father's people who were Chaldeans (Mediterranean, if nothing else). And only people of African/Mediterranean descent form keloid scar tissue during the healing of wounds."
5,"Clean, fresh scent. Highly recommended","I've worn this cologne since high school and will probably continue to wear it for a long time. It just makes you smell clean. Nothing better than a girl/lady/woman telling you how good you smell, and this cologne does the job. Would recommend to anyone 16-50"
3,Ordered and shipped by Amazon,"I ordered this item and it was shipped through Amazon Prime, but unfortunately the prime shipping was just a free normal shipping instead of the usual two-day free shipping. The Item came unopened and untouched; however, i am not sure if it is really an authentic item. The scent seems to disappear after 2 hours. I would invest in a better cologne or a cologne that you have tried in person at a department store."
1,"Seems like a duplicate, cheap product","I have orded this item and been able to bring it to Sri lanka. Was not the normal cool water smell. But accepted assuming a new product. Last week, I got a chance to had a shot from the ""Original"" and the smell is totally different, and the Original is so cool, and very refreshing. So assume the one shipped was a Cheap Duplicate. Do not buy the Mens one.Orderd a women Coll water too, and it was the Original."
4,Superb smell,I like it and it lasts long ( smell) and smell is good. Davidoff is best to choose from... Great
5,Excellent EDT for the Price,My friends asked me to try this stuff. Initially i thought what good it would be for the price but this product exceeded my expectation..Go for it guys
1,Counterfeit???!!!,"I love Cool Water, but what I received was not the Cool Water that I know even though the box said so. My wife informed me the scent was very unappealing although she was a fan of me wearing Cool Water in the past. There was a suspect aroma when opening the bottle that gave off the hint of ammonia. Amazon says they will not accept it as a return under the guise of a ""hazardous substance"". This purchase will definitely impact my future dealings with Amazon."
5,Cool as Ever!!!!!,"I have not used Cool Water for awhile due to me trying other products and Cool Water still smells as refreshing as it did the first time I tried it! It's been and always will be one of my favorites! It's light, long lasting with such a pleasant smell which works just fine for me! I ordered a larger size for the first time due to the great price! I get nice compliments from the ladies too!!"
2,just normal fragrance,it`s just normal fragrance it`s not unique . i don`t know why this fragrance reminds me of something regards cleaning stuff such a soap. shampoo etc .
3,Well...,"When I received this item for my grandson, it was in a very beautiful appealing bottle.But that next day, he used it, and was really displeased. He said it smelt more like bottledalcohol than a cologne. It was so strong when he first sprayed it, but after a while of dryingand weakening a little bit, it started to smell ""OK."" But over all i'm very displeased with thisitem."
3,A bit 90's fragrance,"The fragrance is nice, stays on for 5-6 hrs. But to me its a bit steoreotype like. It wont let you down but its jst tht it doesnt have distinct fragrance tht goes well with a nice outfit."
4,Perfect Product for Perfect Price..!!,I got this spray at a good price when compared to instore. The package arrived in perfect shape to me as mentioned.Thanks
4,Good one!,"I have been using Kenneth cole reaction for a long time and tried this one as it is slighlty less priced. Not disappointing. But, it dont last as much as my KC... Still a good buy!"
1,Cool Water By Davidoff For Men,"I have used Cool Water For Men for over a decade and regularly receive compliments on it. However, with this particular bottle the scent is so weak after a few minutes, that you can't even tell I'm wearing it. It is either counterfeit or a defective batch of product."
5,This product is the best,"Coolwater smell awesome is really great and is long lasting smell.Once I took it out of the box and sprayed it last on me for the whole entire day, and everyone knew what I was wearing."
4,Cool Water,Product size was very large and container was very solid. Fragerance is nice and overall I really like this product.
4,great,love this scent. it is just what i wanted and was exactly what it said it was. word to your mother!
2,WARNING,"WARNING: BE CAREFUL WITH THIS PURCHASE...It is a light fragrance, meaning that it is not strong, making it bearable around others. I suggest before you buy, that you first try it at a department store. Amazon had the lowest price that I could find.Edited review. I have not had cool water in over 12 years, and as some of the reviews mentioned, it does seem watered down (diluted). I just spoke to the return dept at amazon and they told me that the item was unreturnable."
3,Average at best.,"This isn't what I expected cool waters to smell like. I thought it would of had a more ""manly"" smell to it but it ain't a bad smell at the same time. I'll use this but it will be the last time I ever buy cool waters.I recommend Coolwaters for teens ages 13 - 17yrs."
4,Cool scent,Everyone agrees the scent is particularly attractive. Only minus would be it lasts for 3 hours approximately.
5,It just plain smells good,Cool water has a very understated and subtle scent. The closer women get the more compliments they are apt to give.
5,Cool!!!,I just love this perfume. Bought it recently from Amazon after comparing other websites and stores for the same stuff.Its a wonderful cologne with a fragrance that remains on you all the day making you feel fresh.The fragrance is not that strong but is enough to keep you fresh all day.Go and give it a try.
5,All year long perfection,Well I purchased this as a gift for my husband because he absolutely loves this perfume it's not an over powering scent it nice and fresh and great to use all year. And of course I love it too. He likes it so much that I purchased two the price was great and he's been using this perfume for over 10 years LOVES IT.
2,The 4.2oz is diluted or a knock-off product.,"The price on this was great but the product itself is definitely different from other Cool Water colognes. I know how potent Cool Water is and what smells to expect, having used it for many years, and this 4.2oz bottle has a different potency and a slightly different smell. It's significantly weaker than any other Cool Water sprays I've purchased and I've noticed that I continually have to reapply it every few hours in contrast to my other Cool Water sprays which would last an entire work day. DON'T LET THE PRICE FOOL YOU! If you have used Cool Water before then be aware that this product is not the same..."
4,"Sporty, fresh, clean","This is probably the most worn scent out there this year and a must have for any collection. This cologne is probably the least controversial of all of the ones I own, everyone likes it, and it is not too bright. The focus of this cologne is for enhancing a clean and fresh overall scent. It is very midrangy and bassy, sort of a secure, comfortable scent that does not attract a terrible amount of attention but everyone agrees smells good. There is no real high edge scent that grabs attention, but it does smell the same after 6 hours pretty much as it did when you put it on. I've mainly used it in a single squirt after an evening shower, but is also good for a morning scent or office/school wear. HUGO or CANDIES has more character and both smell REALLY Good![...]"
2,Good but watered down,This is my 2nd bottle of coolwater that i've purchased. While the smell is the same it definitely seems watered down. The smell vanishes within 1-2 hours. For this reason alone i give it a 2 out of 5.Edit:After a year of purchasing experience with Amazon...its very clear to me that most of the perfumes/colognes sold here are fakes. They last approximately 1 hour while their real counterparts last much longer (4-6 is the typical depending on the cologne).I went ahead and purchased a cool water from another source and it lasts about 5-6 hours.
3,"Decent, but not one of the best colognes",It's a cheap cologne - you get 4.2 oz for $30 some. It smells nice but doesn't last - there's very little dry down if at all. OK value for money.
1,Poor Product,"It looks like a poor imitation, I used to buy it from Macys and smell excellent and the fragrance keeps for long time. The one that I bough here in Amazon, in a few minutes disappears.It was a Waist my money."
4,It was great,"I bought this for my husband and i love the smell ,but I hope its a real one becouse it has bubbles inside."
1,fake?,I have always used this and typically purchase it from a department store. I purchased it thru Amazon because of price...... product does not have the lasting fragrance that I'm used to.
1,Cool water,"Getting this from Amazon I was almost sure I was going to get the real thing,I ordered several perfumes including this, but I was surprised at what I got,all of the perfumes don't last for up to one hour and this is so disappointing and frustrating,I will never buy any perfume online again,I have learnt my lesson.So sad.Seriously Amazon, what is happening ?,I am really disappointed."
3,afridi,[[ASIN:B0009OAHC It seems to be a good scent for men. It is a clean scent Cool Water By Davidoff For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces
5,Smells fantastic. Great for daytime,"This is a fantastic cologne that you can wear to work or just daily. It's a great daytime cologne that isnt too strong, but powerful enough to get noticed. Light fragrance that isnt overpowering, but smells just right. You won't find a cheaper price anywhere than Amazon. It's a daytime cologne, so if you want something romantic, go for something sexy like Armani Code."
4,Its real but OLD..,"I believe the fragrance you purchase from Amazon or other outside companies are genuine. The only real concern is the shelf life. I have a friend who works for Macy's and she was explaining to me that many of those colognes, perfumes or scents are outdated or aged really well. So you might end up with a bottle or batch that was produced in 2005 and its on sale now in the year 2012. Cologne life span is usually 3 to 5 years. Many last longer depending on what the make up is."
5,Totally Satisfied,"Package arrived early! Yippee :-). Favorite & only cologne I use, and I was totally out.Product was properly packaged (no leaks or defects) and works perfectly.Price is fantastic. Will definitely use this seller again, and again."
5,YUMM!,"I love this stuff. Get the 100ml one, becoz you will use a lot of it, if only becoz it's so good!Oh, just a quick one: if you drop it, and the little spring-thing falls down into it, you can't fix it - it's there for good. BUT! You can still use it as an after-shave type fragrance - just shake the bottle around and it will release enuf liquid to splash on. (Yes, I have experience with this - bottom line: don't drop the bottle!)"
5,cool water,"This is the third time I have purchased Cool Water from amazon for my husband. Not only is it a wonderfully pleasant fragrance, but I can afford it on Amazon ,since it's about half the retail price."
4,Lovely smell,"This perfume doesnt need many sprays to impress ur girlfriend.Many people like it.Even though this perfume is not my first favorite, i still love it"
3,"Good, but lasts only 2-3 hours","My girlfriend was crazy about it, she liked it very much. It has fresh cool odor. But it lasts only 2-3 hours. That's why I am giving 3 stars."
5,Best Perfume,It is the best perfume till date I've ever used. I read it some where in some blog as it is the world's 3rd best perfume. I've ordered for the 1st best perfume and will compare both of them. But till now it is the best.
2,Smell fades away quickly,"Would've been a GREAT product if the smell didn't FADE soo quickly. Upon application, it faded within an hour of use."
2,Not as good as the other ones I purchased,"I have been purchasing Cool Water for a while now through Amazon and they have all been pretty good. This bottle seemed weak smelling as if it were old, not sure what was wrong but usually it has a pleasant sent that last."
2,nice smell that doesnt last,"I purchased this cologne based on the fantastic reviews it got @ amazon...but I was sorely disappointed when i found out that the odor was undetectable a mere two hours after I applied two sprays on myself. Now, I don't know if I got a fake product (i rather doubt that, coming from amazon) or if this is really how it is, either way, I now have a cologne on my hands that doesn't last long enough for me to get where I need to be."
1,Short-lasting Fragrance,Does not last more than an hour. I bought this reading other reviews. It seems that you get lot of water for your money but the scent is no good after a while.
1,poor quality,"The fragnance of this is absolutely nil.i don't smell any fragranace once i use it. No one even my wife,who is next to me always won't know that i have perfume on my cloths,absolutely not satisfied.i will never ever purchase this product again."
3,Good Cologne....,"Smell is a little too abrasive. It smells..... cheap. I was looking for something a little lighter; something for everyday use. After someone accidentally dropped & broke my bottle of this stuff, I decided to go with another cologne; Nautica Voyage, which was exactly what I was looking for."
2,Sweet and Short,"I find this product has a decent oder - but it does not last very long and it is not very potent.30 minutes and it is fading - at the one hour mark, unless you know its there you could not tell"
5,It's o.k.,Cool Water smells o.k.to me. But my wife LOVES it! Hence the five star review. End of story.
2,DON'T BUY IT FROM AMAZON,"This is my favorite perfume. I have been using it for 4 years. When Amazon was selling it for $24.95, I bought it right away. However, this definitely seems to be an altered,weaker formula. Like other 1 starred complaints, the smell is short, fades away in an hour. I don't know if davidoff's formula has been really changed. It's an amazing scent, only if it were orginal. However, Don't buy it from here."
1,Dont buy,This isnt the cool water that i bought in stores. it isnt as strong and the smell doesnt even last an hour
1,"Fake, Beware","Ive been wearing cool water for almost 10 years. Dont waste your money if you want the real thing. The bottle looks real, but the scent is disgusting."
1,Aweful. Don't wate money please..,"One of the WORST cologne I have ever used in my life. Recently I have bought 2 bottles of this, one for me and one for my friend. Fragrance didn't even last more than 45mins. I am very upset about this product. My personal opinion is PLEASE DON'T WASTE money for this product. Go for some other brand."
1,Poor quality perfumes from Amazon,"Hi allThe perfume delivered by [...] is heavily watered down,and barely lasts for an hour.This is definitely a fake,as the same perfume available in shops,from this brand,lasts atleast a few hours.Don't waste your money like I did.Thanks Vandhana"
1,Wrong picture,"Amazon has the wrong picture for this item. It is actually Cool Water DEEP, not Cool Water, and Cool Water Deep smells assy. The seller was nice enough to send me a pre-paid return envelope and Amazon gave me a full refund, but to save people the headache in the future, know that you're going to get Deep and not the original Cool Water."
2,Few new ideas,"Sorry, but I do not agree with the reviews of the other two customers (I chose the book due to these comments!). I received this title last week and I want to sent it back now. I do no find new ideas there. Morever, the instructons are not clear (so beginners, avoid it!) I have bought other books with line-drawings (or photos) explaining the techniques. This book has no more than 6 (perhaps fewer?) line-drawings. There's a part of the book, the one of stamping, that is more interesting than the others, but naturally, I have not bought the book for just one chapter. It does not worth it. I have other books as ""Card Crafting"", ""Greeting Cards with Priscilla Presley"", Origami, which are really useful."
4,Deciphering the meaning of Jewish prayer,"This marvelous book obviously was a labor of love for its author, a practicing attorney, who wrote 214 pages with 814 footnotes! Its premise is that the Jewish prayer service is about consciousness -- specifically, that the order of prayer is designed to induce particular mind-states in the worshipper and create a spiritual community within the synagogue. Rosenberg makes the excellent point that those who would modify the traditional liturgy (and I count myself among them) first should understand the purpose of that being modified. Reading this book will enhance your understanding of prayer in general, and it will make shul-going more meaningful"
5,Mini Muffin Pan,The pan came and I am pleased to say it is in great condition and came quickly. Nice construction! Bought for my daughter in law.It will be great for pecan tarts! Would definitely order again.
4,Fine for muffins not for mini cupcakes!,"I bought this intending to use it for mini cupcakes, it was one of the items that showed up in the search results. It will not properly hold mini cupcake liners. I never make cupcakes without liners. I'm sure it will work for mini quiche bites and muffins. Don't buy it if you want to use it for mini cupcakes and use a liner."
2,Mislabeled item,"This pan is for MINI muffins, not regular-sized muffins. The ""mini"" part should be included in the name of the item, but unfortunately it is not. I had to return my muffin pans because they were not what I thought I was purchasing. Otherwise the quality of the pans seemed high. I think if I had gotten what I expected I would've been much more pleased with the product."
3,"It's fine, not great","I have a similar pan from another brand that's heavier, and the non-stick surface is much better. Problem is I don't know the other brand, it's not stamped and the packaging is long gone."
1,Too small,The size is smaller than I thoughtI don't know how to take out the muffins without using a knife.
3,two years and that's it,"I've used this pan a lot over the past two years. It worked until it didn't. The nonstick just up and died one day recently, almost exactly two years in. Even using excessive amounts of nonstick spray, the muffins would still not release anymore. I purchased a new pan (USA) and same recipe, works just fine. I've tossed the pan, and although it wasn't all that expensive, I prefer to spend a little more and get something that will last a long time. While it worked, it did a good job. Though as another reviewer mentioned, it is an odd size - some mini muffin paper liners worked well and others were not a good fit. All in all, not a bad pan. But if you want a long lasting pan, probably not the best out there."
3,Not non-stick,"This pan has a nice weight to it and is not cheap looking or flimsy which I like. However, it is not ""Nonstick"" like the product title claims. I used paper liners on all except the last 2 rows just to see what would happen and WHAT A PAIN. It was stuck so bad my hands hurt from using a spoon to ""excavate"". I did what I could by hand/force and then poured extremely hot water to scrape off the rest. Never again.I am keeping this product only because it's sturdy and I intend on using paper liners. However, those of you looking for a true nonstick pan that won't require liners will not be happy.Hope this helps someone. Happy baking!"
5,Love this!,"I've been wanting to bake mini-corn muffins so I'm super excited to try this out. Quality seems to be very nice, it's think nonstick metal and in very good condition."
5,A really good quality for the price,"am rather impressed with this one. I got two ( as with mini cupcakes, you make about 48 with one recipe) - and i made egg muffins without liners and mini cupcake with liners in them and all turned out great. I like that i can fir both pans side by side in my over ( they don't overlap at all unlike another brand I had) and was super easy to clean"
5,Great pan works as expected,Works as expected and easy to clean. I also use it to make mini brownie cups or zucchini tots as well as cupcakes. I like that it has 24 cups my other pan was too small so now I can make enough mini cupcakes vs having to make 3 batches in my 12 cup pan
3,Doesn't fit all cupcake liners,I ordered some liners along with this product and they were too big so they crinkled in the pan. I did however buy some at a local Kroger and they fit great. Nice little pan.
5,It Worked,"I wanted to make miniature pecan pies that popped out of the pan easily. They came out perfect! There are several ways to use this pan. It's sturdy and easy to clean, I may buy another eventually!"
5,Great Service~,I realized that I needed to bake mini muffins for an event and didnt have a baking tray. I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price and it was shipped and received within 2 days! This product is great!
5,Baker's Secret 116424001 Basics Nonstick 24-Cup Mini Muffin Pan,"Wife bakes a lot. Trying to keep us healthy, she is making mini muffins to control portion size. Works just great and instead of grabbing a large muffin to snack on, she has us just eating a much smaller one. So far both the pan and the concept are both working well!"
4,awesome!,"I bought this tray along with a mini muffin maker. I prefer the mini muffin maker, but this pan is durable, quality, and is not the type to stick to the muffins!"
5,Excellent product,Cupcakes baked evenly and came out perfect. Two trays fit into my standard size oven side by side with a little space to spare. Great product!
3,Doesn't last over time,"I have had this muffin pan for about 6 years. It held up very well for the first 5, but this past year the non-stick coating has begun to peel off onto the muffins I cook. I can't imagine that eating that is very good for you and it's unsightly. It's a fussy pan that needs to be handwashed and dryed to last a very long time. Do not put it in the dishwasher, it will not come clean and it will rust."
1,Boring,This is no anniverssary book. I expected an historical trip and found only contemporary strips. Too much money for a year of some of the less interesting works of Schultz.
4,Enjoyable Australian,"This is the first of Scott's books I've read, and I enjoyed it. Marc is asked to teach an adult education course after the original lecturer is killed in what might be a gay hate crime, and out of guilt and curiosity he does some brief investigation.Then Paul becomes a minor media star, and Marc signs on as his personal assistant/minder. When another gay man is murdered, this dynamic duo undertake their investigations in earnest. I enjoyed the Australian background and found the two sleuths to be fun and believable.Neil Plakcy, author ofMahu Surfer: A Hawaiian Mystery (An Alyson Mystery)"
1,Buy the book!,"The book was fantastic! It was hard to tell the movie was based on the book. Spend your money wisely, buy the book the movie is terrible."
2,Lost without having read the book,"I am a big Clavell fan who never got to see the Tai-Pan movie, so I ordered the tape.To appreciate this movie at all you must have read the book because too much has been left out to preserve the 2-hour time limit for major theatrical releases.The acting is good. The casting is OK. (May-May is a babe.) However, it is just too scattered to be a coherent piece of work.Those of you who have read Shogun and then seen the full version of the mini-series and later the 2-hour version can get an idea of what Tai-Pan is like.The full version of Shogun wasn't perfect (especially because it had to be censored for TV) but was basically good.The 2-hour version of Shogun was almost impossible to follow, even after having read the book and having seen the full version of the mini-series.I do have to admit that Clavell fans will be disappointed, but I still recommend that you watch it. For those of you who haven't read the book, I think you should pass."
3,Short Changed,"I just saw the movie for the first time from HBO. I figured this had to be like the cut down version they sold of Shogun for a while. But what I'm reading here it apparently isn't. I agree completely that they really short changed this movie by cutting it up like this. You can tell there had to be more because the movie jumped from place to place without much flow. I would really like to see a version that I believe was originally a mini series. I'm pretty sure I give it a 5 star rating then. It had so much going for it much like Shogun. I hope someone decides to restore the original as part of a set from Shogun to King Rat.I'm amazed that Joan Chen didn't make it bigger. She's really damn good, and very pretty to boot..."
1,Very disappointing...,"After reading the book I was extremely disappointed by this poor attempt. I had the 'bad joss' of actually buying the dvd after reading the book. If you hadn't read the book the film would be truly incomprehensible, and if you read the book you would feel a tremendous void. As many other reviewers have said, Taipan needs to be reincarnated as a mini-series of some sort to afford it proper treatment."
3,Tai Pan/Noble House,Tai Pan is more than a chick flick or criticzing of Bryan Brown. It is a prelude to a very good mini series: Noble house! If you haven't seen Noble House you have missed an excellent journey thru banking & financing in the power people. P. Brosnan is the supreme smooth talker. Lots of intrigue & dirty tricks. If you haven't seen this one order it from Amazon!!
1,Wrong Format,The disc I received is not compatable with DVD players in the USA. It would serve the customer better if the shipper would send an email questioning a purchase in the USA if they know it will not work with machines in that region.
2,a rather poor movie!,Taipan would have been better had they made a series of it. One cannot resume such a large story in 90 minutes.
3,Tia Pan,"Bought this movie because i've read the book. It was ok, not one of my favorites. IF you are a fan of the time period then you will most likely enjoy this movie."
3,great trading empires,"James Clavell is known for his blockbuster best selling novels about the historical orient.ShogunandGai-Jinare both sagas of more than 1000 pages each.This movie is an abbreviation of one of those novels about the founding of Hong Kongand the place it played in the Opium, tea and silk trade. The enslavement of Chineseto the opium smoking habit made many British trading house fortunes.This movie is a fictionalization of life of such a trader Dirk Struanand his feud with another trader. Since there are more than one book in these series,the movie has a kind of incomplete feel to it. The revolving moralsof these tycoons involved father two or more families,one entirely Englishand the other half Chinese.Understanding and misunderstanding lead to strange crosses of destinybetween Chinese and English that end in a change of ownershipcaused by a large storm."
1,More like no stars,"I have seen all of James Clavell's literary works that have been turned into movies, ""Shogun,"" ""Tai-Pan,"" ""King Rat,"" and ""Noble House."" Out of all these, ""Tai-Pan"" was the worst. In fact, one person I spoke with doubted if it even made it to the silver screen and didn't go straight to video. If that did happen, I applaud the film makes for not wasting our time and cash on such an awful film. So much was cut out, key plot points such as the half-coins, and trying to condense such a work into 2 hours just is simply impossible. ""King Rat"" was excellent when it was done in 129 minutes, but ""Tai-Pan"" was much more complex and deserved at least a two part mini-series like ""Noble House,"" and ""Shogun"" got. Don't waste your money. If you really want to see this, then go to Blockbuster or your local library and rent it."
1,Tai Pan,Other than the name and location this movie had little to do with the book.The book was great. The movie sucks!
1,Lousy film adaptation,"I love Clavell, the books are great! I've liked some of the on screen adaptations of his novels. King Rat was ok. Noble House could have been better, and the Complete Shogun was more than good. Tai-Pan falls short in so many ways. The screenplay follows the book like some maze running mouse on and acid high. Characters are omitted, continuity is forgotten and if Bryan Brown gets anywhere near a Scotish accent please let me know. I realize Clavell novels don't lend themselves to 2 hour films, except for King Rat which is the shortest I've found, but give me a break. My advice is stay away from this, stick with the book, and hope they do a Mini-series some day."
4,A great story,"Tai-Pan is an excellent movie. The plot is great - the historical establishment of the British colony of Hong Kong, but from a very personal view. The characters were very well done, and Joan Chen was, as usual, wonderful. The movie is not an action-filled adventure, but rather it moves along at a nice steady pace, and not too slow. I enjoyed this movie very much, and recommend it for anyone who enjoys movies with an historical base."
1,Nice visuals can't save a bad movie,"PRO: Set design, costumes and cinematography are nicely done. Visually, this is a beautiful and well-filmed adventure.CON: Even allowing for time limitations, the story is almost unrecognizable. The acting is atrocious with character development being shorthand at best, nonexistent at worst. Struan and Brock are pirates, Culum is pathetic, Gorth is an animal and both May-May and Aristotle are just comic relief. None of the other characters even make an impression. Sub-plots which explain their motivations and other crucial parts of the story are completely ignored (the coins, malaria, Gordon's existence, etc). Don't waste your time or your money on this turkey."
3,Excellent story - poor recording,"This is James Clavell's wonderful story of the creation of Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the recording was a bitter disappointment. The first clue was the fact that the movie is over two hours long and the amount of tape use was 1/3 of the usual VCR tape. Sure enough, there was a note the the movie was recorded in EP. Shame on Video Treasures and Anchor Bay Distribution for a shoddy attempt at recording a wonderful novel. I was wanting a copy to add to my collection of Nobel House and Shogun (both Excellent Clavell stories) and was so disappointed to have such a poor recording. That said, I must say that the movie itself does a fairly good job of recreating the novel. It is probably worth the purchase price. I just wish that they had made a better copy and not tried to cut costs to the bone. Do yourself a favor - buy the book and the tape so that you can immerse your self in the novel and use your imagination to create the ""movie"" the way James Clavell intended."
1,Terrible movie,This movie was awful. Poorly acted with an incomprehensible story. Really lousy and not even worth renting. The accents are unbearable.
4,Tai-Pan,"This is a kind of movie, unfortunately, that they don't make anymore. The production values are immense.You can tell that a lot of work was put into doing the story just right. The story itself was strong, well toldand well acted by a very good cast. It proves that you don't have to cast from the top ten list of stars to makea movie. It was a real treat watching the story unfold and at the same time noting the wonderful job ofproduction design. I have always felt that Bryan Brown was an under rated actor. The rest of the cast was wellplaced, their characters performed so well that you found yourself completely absorbed in the story."
3,"Good, but...","Typical Hollywood in that they had to slice it down to the digestible 2 hour (give or take a bit) morsel. Funny enough, I actually thought this was a 10 hour mini-series, like the other Clavell books on film. And for the first hour and a half of the film, it was following the book on pace.Then they rocketed through the last 400 pages of the book in about 20 minutes, while cleverly adding a segment from Gai Jin (a later Clavell novel) and a happy ending.All and all, not too bad."
3,Tai-pan,"Tai-pan is perhaps my favorite novel, and the movie just doesn't measure up. If you haven't read the novel, you're not going to have a clue what's going on. Changes to the novel's storyline make this hard to follow, and all the condensing needed to reduce a major novel to under two hours of film left out much of the meat of the story. Would be have been far better made into a mini-series, a la another Clavell novel, 'Shogun.'Brian Brown did an excellent job breathing life into the title character, despite the limitations of the script. His performance is one of the few bright spots of the film.Bottom line, the film could have been much better. But even with the myriad flaws, I still enjoyed watching this Clavell treasure come alive."
1,"horrible movie, good book","The book is hundreds and hundreds of pages long. I don't know how they expected to do it justice in 2 hours. Changes were made in the film to be more titillating (though the book already has its' racy moments). For example, in the book most of the prostitues are Europeans and Australians from the lower classes and are not described as attractive. In the movie the prostitues are nubile Asians."
2,Great features; not so great durability,"Phone has good sound quality in handset and speakerphone mode, great range from base station, easy to use presets and other dialing functions. However, many of the keys have already become somewhat lame. They now require you to press very hard; I have missed more than one call because the on/answer button simply would not respond no matter how hard I pressed it."
3,Good and not so good,"This phone system met our needs perfectly (two lines, no messaging system, speaker phone, multiple handset capability) and from that point of view its been a really good phone. However, the keypads on the handsets have become problematic: you have to really press hard to get a number to register and when you do you often get multiples of the one number you're trying to type."
2,Keypad went bad,"I had this phone for about 2 years. After the first year the keypad started going bad. This is why I am here searching for a new one to buy. You have to press really hard on the keys, also when pressing on one number you may get multiples of the same number. Reception and range are good."
3,Good examples and Clear layout of procedures,"this book is very suitable for someone who wants to learn how to build a software in an Object-Oriented way applying OOD and OOA concepts using the cases provided in the book like the Video Store. As an OOP I found this book to be a little of help but a good review to refresh your OOA and OOD skills. You must have an intermediate knowledge about UML to understand the Models being used for Class and Use Case designs, and C++"
2,Are you buying this book ?,"This is a book that covers OO Design in some detail. Emphasis is placed on design aspects rather than actual coding...University Students Buy it if ONLY your instructor recommends it !! Even better, try for a library loan , as you would never ever use it after the course is over ! ;-)"
5,East of Eden,Definitely the most sought after East of Eden Album -a collector's item.Superb sound quality and highly recommended.A pity it is not available in RSA.
4,excellent,"Ok, so evidently, as per my reviewer friends, this is not an album you buy from Amazon: the track listing here is wrong. But if you can find the album that has the tracks listed here, I strongly advise it.The album as such is a fantastic mix of country, blues and prog. The songs are self contained, and the sax and violin combo East Of Eden used really make this music work: it is not prog in the extended suite sense, but the unique combonations of instruments and the jazzy solos make this highly gripping music,The highlight: ""Crazy Daisy,"" a pungent hard rock jazz jam that alone makes the album worth seeking"
3,Amazing musician,"Michel Martelly is a phenomenal musician, and this comes through at times on this CD. I'd recommend you listen to some of his live recordings (e.g. Sisisi live, Live at Best Western, and Live Au Zenith), which are amazing."
5,REAL HIP HOP!,"This is the first single off of De La Soul's new album ""Art Offical Intelligence: Mosaic Thump"". The first track ""Oooh!"" featuring brick city's own, Redman on the chorus. Posdnus and Dave have stepped up there lyrics on this track, surpassing all the other radio-friendy, thugged out, r&b laced rap that you are are used to. Oh yeah it's funny to. Track number two,""Foolin"" is another gem with insightful lyrics and bumpin' track with that unconvientional De La feel to it. This is what you should be bumpin' this summer. This is the summer hit of '00.Five out of Five Stars"
1,Beyond offensive.,"This is an incredibly offensive, obscene and reprehensible costume for anyone, let alone Amazon, to carry. What if my children were searching this site for costumes and were looking for Catholic saints? This would surely appear and that is reprehnsible. So disappointing that this is what our world comes to - mocking people of faith."
4,excellent,"Premium was one of the best films I saw last year.In a climate of formulaic plots and predictable storylines, I found Chatmon's writing to be authentic and CREATIVE, two elements often missing in today's cinema. I enjoyed the perfomances of the actors, especially Zoe Saldana. I don't think I have ever been moved by any of her performances until seeing Premium. I really liked her and belived her and I attribute that to direction, once again, Chatmon bringing something fresh to the screen. Dorian Missick was textured and Hil Harper, tangible.I love seeing people of color on screen with purpose and presence. This film delivers that for me and I will buy it to have it alongside the other credible films in my library."
2,Superb actors...average storytelling and production,"I absolutely love Hill Harper and adore Zoe Saldana. It is a shame that this is the best that these amazing African American actors can get in terms of work. Hill Harper's character is days away from marrying his beautiful fiance Charli (Zoe Saldana) when Charli runs into her former fiance and still aspiring actor Cool. Cool's reappearance in Charli's life makes her rethink her pending marriage. It's not that this is a completely horrible story, but the story line and production are average at best. These movie is slow in parts and contains out of place comedic scenes that border on buffoonery. Too bad for these amazing actors and some of the other good African American characters in this film."
3,Pleasantly entertaining,"I watched this at the American Black Film Festival in Miami last year and found it quite an enjoyable experience.It was certainly refreshing to see black characters not playing the fool or indulging in the usual stereotypical fare for a dumbed down audience. However, I felt it didn't really have anything particularly new or insightful to say and is the kind of movie you're glad you've seen but won't really linger long as a memorable movie moment.Having said that, it's a welcome addition to the much needed diversity in black film entertainment."
1,Premium,Oh now I get why they named the movie Premium... cause the guys a filling station attendant... ok... and why was thiy movie EVER made... just BAD!
2,Disappointed,"I'm starting get a little disappointed in African American ""B"" movies these days. I have a lot of BET movies and they were really good. But lately, they are just stupid. Like this movie Premium. I'm so glad I rented it and not buying it. I'm just looking at it shaking my head. I mean, it wasn't horrible, but it's certainly a movie that should be rented."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I love my black ""B"" rated movies but this one just didn't pull it off for me. It looked like cheap production. This wouldn't be a good pick if your into black movies like me."
2,NEVER AGAIN,"I read some of the reviews fr this movie, overall everyone seemed to enjoy it. I was really displeased with the outcome! It seemed at if it was really low budget. Also it seemed like the story line was all over the place. If i could order it over agin i would think twice on if i would get it or not. The movive was not at all great!"
4,"If you have a heart and a conscience, this gets to them!","I went for years denying that the voice of George Jones could touch me. Even though I grew up in the South on country music, there was something about George that seemed too, too country. Then a friend gave me this album and said ""You've got to hear this"" and the first time I listened, it blew me away...especially ""Choices,"" ""Cold Hard Truth,"" and ""When the Last Curtain Falls."" His voice has all the eloquence of a Shakespearean actor with the poignancy of modern-day regrets. Just about anyone will find a little of him/her self in the words of these songs. The musicianship is simple, straightforward, and wonderful. A gotta have!"
5,"don't overlook ""I'm Over You.""","I cannot add anything to the many reviews of ""Cold, Hard Truth"" other than to say that I agree with what everyone says, especially those who state that it's far better than any young-country trash coming out of Nashville today. For those of you who, like myself, are big fans of George Jones's slow, sad songs (such as ""Day After Forever"" and ""Bed of Roses""), don't overlook song #3 on his previous cd, ""It Just Don't Get Any Better Than This"" entitled ""I'm Over You."" It's reminiscent of ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" inasmuch as it describes a man who is finally over a woman because he has died. It has a classic Jones closing (I have long argued that no one can close a song, especially a sad one, the way George Jones can) that leaves you with goosebumps. Radio should be ashamed that they missed this one."
5,"George's ""Bed of Roses""","With this powwerful collection of songs, Geore Jones delivers musical roses- fragrant with music and verse yet tinged with the thorns of hard living.I've listened to his music for many years and saw George/Tammy perform live on their last concert tour and I can definitely say ""Cold Hard Truth"" is a CD for the ages!!Thank you Mr. Jones."
5,"A COUNTRY CD, THATS PURE COUNTRY!","George Jones has outdone himself. This is backdoor, frontdoor, jukebox and dancehall music. A true country CD that goes back to the roots of country music!! THANK-YOU GEORGE JONES!"
4,He lives to tell it all-------thank God!,"George's voice is in superb form on this album and the musical quality of the songs is excellent. My only gripe here is that some ""pop"" tends to seep into the songwriting ever so slightly. None of that is George's fault, of course, because he has limited resources to work with in this day and age of ""country"" music. No one seems to write hard-core country anymore, like George recorded up until Garth destroyed country music. Some of us ""amateur songwriters"" who don't get our work published can write better country songs than these salaried 9 to 5 office worker country songwriters in Nashville. Unfortunately, we don't have the ""pull"" to get our material recorded, or George would have his pick of traditional material. It's hard to find these days, but he does his most excellent work with what's available. There is no one better than George Jones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Absolutely,his best work yet! Unbelievably Perfect!!!!","When are the radio stations gonna wake up and smell Pure Country Music? Let the so-called artists that hog all the air time now form a new spin-off genre and let us diehard country fans hear George and others like him who respect and love country music. George is at his best when he's singing about heartache & love. And this album lets him ""Shine On"". I predict ""CHOICES"" to surpass his all time greatest classic, ""He Stopped Loving Her Today""."
5,Simply the best George has every created!!,"I recently purchased the new Cold Hard Truth cd that George Jones recorded and I was immediately intrigued by how well that some of his songs on this new cd really relate to life and its many ups and downs. Eventhough I am only 17, country music is my passion, it is the only music made that actually has a point and will make sense to absolutely anyone... I truly feel that this is the best recording project that George has ever done and it will truly be hard for him to top this award winner!!!"
3,"George is great, but, boy, is Nashville a soul-less place...","I didn't hear this CD when it came out, so I'm just catching up. I'm a long-time GJ fan, with a preference for the earlier material, although the duets with Tammy still kill me.This sounded interesting - back to the basics, etc. And George is singing very well, which is always (duh) a treat. But this production - it has that modern Nashville thing where it sounds like they ran they the personality vacuum cleaner over all the musicians before they were allowed to come into the studio, and then once more for good measure before each take, just to make nobody actually got excited about what they were playing. Don't get me wrong - everything is note perfect, but they might as well be robots.So, nice try, but, guys, listen to ""White Lighting"" to hear how it should be done."
5,Another Real Country CD--Way To Go George!!,"Just like ""I Lived To Tell It All"" this is real country music. Well written songs that only George Jones can sing the way they should be sung....from the heart. Songs about real life. The kind of country music we love!"
5,Country music at it's absolute best!,"George Jones is the finest singer this world will ever have. He sounds as good today as he did twenty years ago. George can still tear your heart out with his songs as no other can. As long as ""the possum"" keeps recording, I'll keep buying the albums. The music industry thinks it knows what the young fans of today want, but I'm 27 and only listen the ""real country"", the classics. Country music has forgotten it's roots, including most of the artists that made it. Hopefully they'll listen to the fans and bring back the ""good"" country music. George is the king!"
5,same old george,I will tell you all something Iam.24 years old and George has bin telling how it is and always bin for many years befor I was ever on this earth.George has helped me thewmany hard times .His songs are aboutreal life and about thing that hapento all of us at one time or another.GOD BLESS GEORGE JONES.
5,Real Country Music,"How many times have you heard the expression ""Haggard And Jones"" in a song. Haggard And Jones are THE major influences in country music today and this, is Jones. There's nothing more you need to say.GB, radio presenter, Australia"
4,Classic Possom,"I doubt if George has ever sung a song he could relate to any more than ""Choices"", though he didn't actually write it himself. The ironic timing of its release, coinciding with his accident, was a reminder of how much his music has always paralleled his personal life. But there's much more to this collection than that one single. This is classic George. His singing is every bit as good as it's ever been, if not better. Half ballads (""Day After Forever"" & the title track rank among his very best ever), and half up-tempo rockabilly (my personal favorite being ""Ain't Love a Lot Like That""), George may not be the most diverse artist. But he's so good at what he does, you don't even mind."
4,75301 Height Adjuster Review,Porter Cable should advertise this item more. It provides a good alternative and simplifies use of the router table. I would not have known it was available if I had not done so much searching on the internet. It performs well and is very cost effective.
4,Not enough holes- An Afterthought?,"I bought the P-C 891 Router and the P-C 698 Table, supposedly compatible. I ordered the 75301 Height Adjuster because it looked like a great help for adjusting the motor height from above. But there are no HOLES in the TABLE to pass this Adjuster through! The folks at Porter Cable admit they forgot to provide holes for the 890/891/892 router motor, and they are very nice about this, but told me yes, I really have to drill two holes in the table to use this gadget! The table comes with plenty of other holes to accomodate the attachments, motors, etc. so it seems a shame that they did not make two holes for the ht. adjuster. Actually it's not hard to reach underneath to open and close the locking lever and twist the original height adjuster. I just don't know if I want to drill out the table yet."
3,Fine but cheaper alternatives,"This is fine and works, but just buy http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036DF332/ref=wms_ohs_product instead. You need to trim away some plastic but that works just as well. Or another nut driver. They work just as well."
5,Must Have Option for Router Tables when using Porter Cable Router,"I bought this to use with the Porter Cable 891 router but I've heard this works on quite a few models. I have to say, a local woodworking shop tried to get me to buy their brand, glad I didn't. This Porter Cable option was the same price and works perfectly with the 891. Handle is easy to turn, you only need drill one small hole in your router table, and the bottom bell on this thing gives you a reference point to judge how much to turn it before measuring the exact height of your router on the table."
1,If you want to get frustrated everytime you place a call...,"This phone worked well for a while, then suddenly, the buttons became impossible to push and dial! I can't tell you how frustrating it is trying to dial a phone number pressing and repressing a digit until it finally registers. Also, there must be a ghost that comes along with the phone; several times a week a caller on the other end says, 'I can't hear you, but someone else'? Why does this happen? Well, this system automatically scans for the best channels during calls, therefore you can momentarily be in on a neighbor's conversation. All the company has advised me to do is maintain a safe distance (50 ft radius) of the base! Why bother having a cordless phone? Now, after we've loaded our house with this idiotic phone system we have to go back and spend a bundle re-outfitting! Next time, I'll be sure to check with the opinions of other customers and not buy a ""Costco special"". ARGHHH!!!!"
4,It's hard for me to review this book,"I didnt really read this book all the way through. There was only one passage in paticular I was looking for. My grandmother was the nanny of Joan Crawford's kids, making her witness to the events described in Mommie Dearest. So it's alright"
2,Well!,"WAY,WAY to heavy ,if you leak A LOT,maybe OK. Only plus,gives you a very impressive bulge,if that makes any difference!"
3,it is ok,the picture of these steps make them look better than they realy are. the are cast aluminum and very light. time will tell if they last.
4,The World According to Bush,"Although my Panasonic DVD recorder/player was unable to ""read"" this disc, thus viewed it om my computor (a minor inconvienience), I found this to be a serious and well-done documentary...one that we all should see and share with everyone we know. Where ""Fahrenheight 9/11"" was well-done for entertainment as well as information, this French film-maker created a documentary that delves more into the Bush Family history which is important to know in order to better understand where G.W. is coming from."
5,A must see....an eye opener.,"The best documentary so far,loved every moment of it. Money does miracles, money can buy anything. Chilling documentary, will leave you thinking about it for days.Highly recommended."
3,Frogman or Spy,"Frogman or SpyThis book is a popular, spare, and speculative account of the pre-eminent British World War II underwater warfare expert, who finished during the visit of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze to British during the coronation of Elizabeth II, including that he died in an attempt to recce the ship. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare and espionage. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."
4,Black Cloth?? Maybe~Maybe Not,"The bolt of speaker cloth that I have seems to have more of a charcoal black appearence. In other words a subtle touch of gray. It is of a nice weave and looks good, but others seem to have had various degrees of coloring in this black cloth also! I have found better colors of black cloth from other sellers, but this is still a nice fabric to work with, just be prepared for something other then a solid black color!"
2,The color is awful,"Although the quality and openness of this cloth is good, the color is awful. It is not true black and does not go with black wood furniture."
5,speaker cloth,excellent material to work with. Used to cover wood frames to match componenets within cabinet.
1,does not sound like ace,I am a major ace cannon fan and this just does not sound like his quality of work
5,Perfect tests!,I've been using these for several years. They are so quick and easy to use that I test my Koi water more often than I used to. I really appreciate the total hardness test.
1,Not accurate,"A couple of my fish (koi) died because these strips have been telling me my water perimeter was good. Of course I don't blame these strips for killing my fish but had it told me the truth, I could have done something to save them. the only reason I found out these weren't accurate was when I started noticing that strip after strip, despite the water looking very different each time, it told me the same thing! When I went out to get a proper kit, it told me different!!! I would get into details how I found it inaccurate but I'd rather skip that and just tell you to look elsewhere.Do yourself and your fish a huge favor and buy a proper kit."
2,Big Surprise,"This album was NOT what I thought it would be. It's much more of a karaoke session than a tribute. The few highlights of the album are ""Distant Lover,"" portrayed by Brian McKnight, and D'Angelo & Erykah Badu's ""Precious Love."" Also, Gerald Levert did a smooth remake of ""Let's Get It On,"" though it resembles the original so much- much like the rest of the album. Profyle's track sounds NOTHING like a new group, as they duplicated Marvin Gaye's effort of ""What's Goin' On."" Tony Rich and Grenique spent much more time and creativity on ""If This World Were Mine,"" which pleases the ear after hearing such mindless replicated tunes throughout the first 12 songs of the album.The lack of ""new-ness"" is unappreciated on this tribute. Old instruments, reinterpreted by newer ones does not seem to effect the overall old fashioned results of Marvin's greatest hits. If you like the old versions, then keep them and forget this..."
2,A Nice Effort,"Not one of these performer (with the exception of D'Angelo and Erykah Badu) could really capture the same magic as Marvin could. Sure it's a nice try but none of these remakes stay true to the spirit of Marvin Gaye and can't even come close to the impact that Marvin had when he did these songs. Though D' and Erykah did a really great remake of ""Your Precious Love"", that song is the only song worth having on this album."
4,timeless classics!!!!,"great item, bought for a friend.. his wife loved it!!! classic songs sung by some great artists!! Would recommend to other people"
2,But for Badu and D'Angelo this album should disappear!,"Totally Agree with GordenV. The Badu D'Angelo version of Your Precious Love is the only track worth having on this album. The version of Sexual Healing by El Debarge virtually removes all of the soul and class of the original. Horrible! Let's Get it On is no better. Why even record this version of Mercy Mercy Me, it copies the original verbatum and yet never comes close to the originals greatness. Same with I Want You. Horrible!!!This album only proves what a remarkable vocal/production Genius Marvin was."
5,Best Collar Around!,I wanted to share my satisfaction with the Teafco Fydo Action Collar. First of all my dogs wear these collars 24/7 and move with ease as if no collar was even present.....in other words they aren't bothered by the collar the least bit. In the past I have purchased collars that have rubbed the hair on their necks and ones that seemed to irritate them. The Fydo collar is lite weight and extremely functional in all conditions (wet or dry). I recommend this collar as an all around great buy. I have never seen these collars in pet stores and people always ask were I purchased mine.
5,Excellent Collar,"I bought two of these collars for my lab/collie mix and my walker coonhound. They each had already broken numerous conventional collars, so I was skeptical as to how well these would work. When we recieved them, I put them on my pups immediatly, and they looked wonderful on! The double locking system had nevery failed us and they don't slip over their heads like some collars do. The only bad thing about this product is that the metal id tag in the middle does come out. But honestly, it doesn't take away from the use of the collar at all. I would rely on putting your information on that id tag, I have multiple tags attached to the ring on the collar. I am very please with this buy, and everyone that has had troubles with conventional collars should definately purchase these!!"
1,"Hate it, dog hates it.","I don't know if the collar I got is defective or what, but it really doesn't work. Followed the directions and it seems the little notches are out of sync. The name tag has fallen out every time I've put the collar on my pup (golden lab) and yeah. Really disappointed in this product. Fortunately, I didn't pay full price and it would cost as much to ship it back as to just use it as a dog toy -- which it now is."
1,Better PVC Collar - Ethical PlayStrong Dog Collar,"For anyone that's having a problem w/ these collars, like the basic design & security of a regular buckle collar yet waterproof - try out the Ethical PlayStrong Dog Collars.I actually JUST found them online trying to find a better deal on these. They come in fantastic colors/ designs & have all the great attributes of the rubberized PVC, but have the holes & buckles of traditional PLUS they're much cheaper! Avg. anywhere between $7-12 from small to larger sizes. They're really cool too. Sorry Fydo - there's a better product out there that I don't have to worry about fitting or falling apart!"
4,Wonderlicious...,"So, I needed an interesting solution for a new bike setup. This friction option was the best solution.So, long story short. These worked. Noodles..."
5,Simply the best,"The PS3 is simply an amazing console.Don't listen to all the foolish haters, and see for yourself.It comes with a Blu-Ray drive for HD movie viewing.It has a growing number of useful features constantly being added by Sony.Multiplayer games are free over the PlayStation Network."
1,Buyers beware of first time Sellers,I bought this PS3 and it wouldnt read any PS3 Game Disc although it did read some Playstation 2 discs.
2,not impressed,"i Recently purchased an wii, then my room mate just got the ps3. the ps3 is nothing special in my point of view.It looks like a hyped up ps2, the graphicsare better, but for the price i would never get one, i was very close to purchasing a ps3 then i saw it in person and was very dissapointed. i have a wii and 360, as for grpahics, i prefer the 360, as for fun get the wii, the wii will entertain u for hours upon hours...Im sure the ps3 mightget better when more games come out, but as for now, i wouldnt waste my money, hold off, its not worth it"
1,Great system-Terrible Customer Service,"We're long time Playstation fans and have owned each unit throughout the years. We gladly upgraded to the new PS3 last year and after a little over a year our PS3 died during a firmware update Sony forced our system through. Our system, now out of warranty would cost $170 to be 'repaired' by Sony. I find it unacceptable to charge a consumer to repair a system which broke due to their software upgrades. This is the last time I will ever by a Playstation."
2,Barely above a PS2 in terms of Gameplay,"Just hear me out. I know there are a lot of people out there upset with the negative press Sony is getting because of the PS3, but please keep an open mind. Yes, the PS3 has the capabilities of being a great system, however the games are not taking advantage of the system. The games are basically just better looking PS2 games. The six axis controller adds NOTHING to the game. I think its just a cheap gimmick added on because of Nintendo's controller. And for $600 I have to buy an ADDITIONAL [...] cable to connect to my HDTV? Come on Sony, give us a break. There are also lots of bugs and glitches in the launch titles. It is better to wait until these get hammered out before you spend a huge chunk of change on this questionable system. Don't get me wrong, Sony has potential, but they may have shot themselves in the foot this generation."
3,"RIGHT NOW THIS SYSTEM IS A 2, LATER THIS SYSTEM WILL BE A 5!","The ps3 has potential for being a great system, there is no doubt about that, unfortunitely so far i am completely unimpressed with what it has had to offer, as a fan of the playstation franchise i cannot in good nature say that they have done a good job with this system, for the long run it is a great system to purchase no douobt, with titles like the ff7 remake and metal gear solid 4 one would have to be crazy not to buy this system in the long run, however, i do find it foolish to stand in line for 24 hours waiting for a system that has absolutely nothing to offer gamers at the moment and whats even worse, going on ebay and buying this system for thousands of dollars, why not just wait! Remember that the turtle beat the hare at the end of the race, a little patience goes a long way,the system right now 2 out of 5the system when the great titles come out 6 out of 5"
2,Weak audio spec for real high-end BD player,"PS3 does not support some HD audio format. DTS-HD is not supported by PS3. PS3 cannot output bit stream of Dolby TrueHD to AV receiver. Be aware of the audio format and PS3 specification, if you are serious about real HD experience."
2,Same Old Same Old,"So basically, the playstation 3 is exactly like playstation 2, except with better graphics. The games are obviously beautiful, but the gameplay and storylines of most games are subpar. Yes it's exciting because it's a new system, but it's really nothing new at all. I expect to get bored of it really soon. If you want something awesome, get the Wii. Trust me, now THAT'S a real next generation console. The graphics may not be as great as ps3 or x360, but if you buy games only because the graphics, then maybe video games aren't for you and you should stick to DVDs. Anyway, the ps3 is definitely inferior overall compared to the Wii. Go ahead, take my word for it and sell your ps3 or use the money you were gonna buy it with on a Wii, and have almost 400 bucks leftover."
5,Flew 1200 Miles and it works great,"I bought my PS3 in Baltimore and took it home to Jamaica. While the box took up all the space in my carry-on bag (no way was I checking it on)I had no plans on putting anything else in that carry-on. Of course taking it all the way from the US I held my breath until I switched it on and alas it worked, I worried about transporting it, so I bought bubble wraps just to be sure.So far I can only speak of the Blu-Ray movies, spectular, I bought Will Smith ""In the Pursuit of Happiness"" and I was impressed, especially with the previews.I also picked up the optional Remote Control, Memory card adaptor and a HDMI cable. Let me say it makes no sense putting a PS3 on anything else but a HD Television. I will configure the Wi-Fi capability and start downloading some free stuff. I have used up all the HDMI slots on my TV, just need a hub now."
2,Overheated,"Something was wrong with it already. After it warmed up (and it got pretty hot), it just completely shut down and I couldn't do anything on it. The seller was gracious and I got my money back."
5,"best deal so far, I own one",I have had this unit for three months and it is a great multipurpose box. Plays the PS2 games fine and BR disks look great. Get one while you still can.
5,"Still in the beggining, but shining already!","I play video-games since 1980 and no other console, well maybe the PSX with Tekken, impressed me so much in his first months like this one. I believe that most people who is complaining about it are the ones who haven't played yet. It's expensive, yes it is, but you'll expend more with games in an year then with the console itself, as with any other console in the market. You want to wait a price drop, fine, but you'll have a lot of games to catch up when this happen. And the Blu-Ray player is good also, 007:CasinoRoyale is a must."
5,I love this format. GRAPHICS!,This is a real cool game system. There is a bit of a learning curve for the system if you are a big gamer or computer savvy than it's probably simple but for the occasional gamer like myself it took a little getting use to when trying to get around the system options. Once I played The Darkness and Fear on this system all my navigation woes disappeared. Just simply Awesome!
4,A good buy,"It's big and heavy, but goddam it's great. It's a machine that can do virtually anything, I am glad I bought one and I can't wait for more games to come out.But you're gonna need a flatscreen-tv to use it at it's full potential."
4,"Excellent system, but.... where are the games?","I bought this product because its price drop offer. I have an Xbox 360 and I'm really happy with that console. The problem with this console (PS3) is the lack of good games. If you don't have an HDTV please don't buy this product because the only current value that have is the DVD Blue Ray player, and don't have sense to buy it to use it in a normal TV.I hope that in a future the games library be better."
1,Returned two units,"I bought the PS3 only to play movies, The first unit was dead on arrival, the second unit would not mate with the optional dvd remote. I returned the second unit and will now nuy a player only, if I can find one for sale."
1,I was specting more,"FIRST I GOT ONE WHEN IT CAME OUT THE FIRST DAY AND I HAVE A WII AND A XBOX 360 ELITE. IN GRAFICS THE XBOX IS MUCH BETTER THAN PLAYSTATION 3 AND IN GAMEPLAY THE WII IS MUCH BETTER THAN PLAYSTATION 3 AND XBOX 360.THE PLAYSTATION 3 IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS. FROM THE 3 MACHINES FIRST IS XBOX 360 ELITE IS THE BEST SECOND THE WII IS SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY WITH ALL THE FAMILY AND LAST IS THE PLAYSTATION 3 BECAUSE YOU NEED A LOT OF MONEY TO PLAY 1080P YOU NEED A BRAND NEW TV AND SPECIAL CABLES FOR THE PLAYSTATION 3 SO CAN GO IN FULL 1080P AND THE CABLES COST MORE THAN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE TV IS LIKE 3,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY. IS LESS FUN TO PLAY WITH IT IF YOU HAVE TO SPEND ALL THAT MONEY DON`T YOU THINK."
2,Sony should be sued....,I think sony should be sued for not completing the ps3 before christmas just because they wanted money because they know that people would buy ps3's for their kids on Christmas and I have heard that it freezes up and it gets too hot. I haven't actually played it but by the looks I think it is a little oversized and overpriced and doesn't even have a rumble pak because they said it would mess the motion sensor but than again the wii has a rumble pak and it isn't messed up and why I know is because my brother has a wii. So thats why I think sony should be sued.
2,Bust!,"I work at a large game developer as a game modeler and I can tell you that all the hype about blue-ray and dvd-hd means nothing. The developer community is having a hard time working with the Sony system because the sheer lack of support. Microsoft learned from the first Xbox that this is very important in making a viable system. As of right now almost all of my programmers don't like to work with the PS3. Here's a secret, if you can't use all 50gigs, then you can't take advantage of some of the features of the system. Don't buy for another 6 months... if you want to burn $700 send it to me."
1,No games...no thanks,Not spending 600 bucks on a system with no good games. I might buy it in a year when they actually have games and the price is around 400.Sony is ripping everyone off...this is just a blu-ray trojan horse.
2,its good,ps3 is kool but most games till now sux plus the long loading in every game toke 20-40 sec .
5,Definately a great buy..,of course the PS3 is an outstanding piece of hardware with a blu-ray player built-in..but everyone make sure you redeem the 5 free blu-ray movies you get with a purchase of a PS3 after you fill out the redemption slip...
5,best console,"I have all three, and this one has the best potential of any of the rest. Also, the best blu-ray player on the market."
5,The best,"SOny fanboy for life, the PS3 well it has everthing you might want wifi access, web browser, a 60GB Hard Drive, and a bluray player."
3,"Great for multimedia, Bad for games","The online service in PS3 its regular, the catalog of games sucks, but as a multimedia center this its great, have bluray player, flash memory reader, yo can install linux, view DVDs. but if you want to just play games, go for 360"
1,bad product no surprise,"So I bought this system a year ago on Amazon.com & it broke less than a month later...the same thing old nintendos used to do..the motherboard is supposedly burnt out...I'm still paying the $400 this cost me..why no review for over a year..easy I've been offline since 2011.Sony won't even fix it..tip to buyers..don't buy anything from this seller or used in general from amazon..Amazon failed to send me an album order last year & recently asked me to review it..surprise surprise..my review was negative towards Amazon, & they refused to post it..imagine thatI doubt I will be buying from Amazon ever again"
3,So disappointed,"I have two HDTVs. Guess what? The PS3 won't connect in High Def to either one. Know why? Sony's blu-ray protection scheme. Way to go Sony! No blu-ray movies, no hi-def video games, no HDMI signal. So tell me again how this high-def console is going to blow me away. Sure, I can watch it with the old connectors, but why'd I buy all this stuff then? Apparently, this is becoming a prevalent problem. Depressing news after spending soooo much money on the PS3. Sooooo angry..."
1,Don't buy this!,"This thing is sooooooooooooo expensive! The controllers don't have the rumble feature! Sure, it has nice graphics and all, but the animation is choppy!Get the Wii instead of this! The Wii is way cheaper than this and the remote has a built-in motion sensor . And you can download any Nintendo game from the NES to N64! Please don't buy this! This is VERY expensive and costs lots of money! The Wii is much more fun and much, much cheaper than this! Believe me!"
1,PS3 does not meet expectations,"Unfortunately, I have not had as good an experience with my PS3 as I did with my 360. Not only does it constantly crash, but there are absolutely no games out there.Furthermore, many games that are being developed for both systems are better on the 360. One example is the highly anticipated Madden 08 that runs 60 Frames per second on 360 but only half of that, 30 frames per second on the PS3.If you are thinking about getting a PS3, I strongly advise you to rething your decision and get either an XBOX 360 or a Wii (depending on whether you want a better gaming experience or a family friendly console). The PS3 has a long way to go before it becomes Xbox 360 caliber."
3,Get a 360,"I've played both, and to tell the truth..... just get a 360. Not only does the PS3 have a VERY limited selection of games at the moment, but in terms of graphics, 360 basically is the equivalent or its better. Not to mention the controller is better on 360 and its online network IMO, so I don't really see any reason to get a PS3 at all thus far."
1,My original Playstation 3 died after a year of ownership,"My original Playstation 3 (almost $1,000 with controversial chip) died after a year of ownership and I must have used it less than five hours! Since it made more economic sense to buy a new one than send it back, it just sits there -- original pristine box in storage -- to maybe sell on eBay years from now for its eclectic collectibility as the ""first Playstation 3"" or whatever... who knows, maybe it's just a hard drive failure? (The thing is so proprietary that I can't easily troubleshoot the problem, and I don't want to send it in for local repair because I heard they swap out the original chip for a later one, and that chip alone could be worth more than what I original paid for this useless piece of garbage.)"
1,Save your money!!!!!,"Now I am not a fan boy of any system what so ever. I am an owner of an xbox 360 and a nintendo wii. I played my friends ps3 that he waited in line for more than 30 hours to get, and neither of us were blown away by anything. I loved my ps2, but this system is not worth the $600. No matter what people are saying. The graphics do not come close to the 360. Yes I know these are launch titles, But NBA 2K6 for the 360 looks much more impressive then 2K7 for the PS3. There is no rumble in madden, and the motion sensors are a joke. If you are going to spend $600 dollars on a playstaion 3 SAVE YOUR MONEY until they go down a little. Or buy an xbox 360 core system and a nintendo wii. And still save $50."
5,PS3 is worth the price.,I can not begin to stress out how happy I am that I receaved a 60 gig. I was not too sure about the PS3 however now that I have my PS3 I play it as much as my 360 if not MORE.
3,might have been fun,"it was stolen by savages from my house. I hope they play it so long they don't get jobs, get addicted to drugs, go to jail and meet ""bubba"". But I don't think the PS3 will have anything to do with any of that happening."
5,Ready for the future,"I think this is the best deal in electronics right now. You get an advanced gaming system, Blu-ray, internet access, and is upgradable, which no other Blu-ray player can do at the moment. Also, there is Ipod Touch and Iphone intergation available shortly. It would have been nice if this system came with a game or movie or remote. But still, you can't beat this. I know Wii is all the rage right now, but this is ready and poised to be the winner in the long run. I think a year from now, you will be even happier you purchased this."
2,Prepare to be Disappointed!!,"I used to be a Playstation Gamer exclusively and since i bought my Playstation3 i have since switched my bandwagon. 7mos. after purchase it went down, Kaput!!! Blank! Zero! Nada! I looked online and found similar experience's and am wondering now why i did'nt do as much research before i bought it??!!1 MY BAD!!! My XBox 360 is three years old and i have never had a problem with not being able to play or otherwise enjoy my system. Not even sure if i am going to fix it. $150.00 is a lot of money to spend on something that will probably break down again. Microsoft and XBox rule for a reliable and continuing experience!!! Thanks Bill!!"
5,You all know this is to good to be true.,Everyone of you ordering this know that they made a mistake and you are all taking advantage of it. What would you do if they made a mistake and overcharged you? All they are going to do is admit they made a mistake and refund the cost.
5,Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee! A PS3!,"A absolutely wonderful thing on so many levels. Yes, I know, many balk at the price tag, but it's still the cheapest way to get a Blu-ray player. As one who's got all of the systems, it is the highest performing of any, bar none. The Xbox 360 doesn't even come close to it.Admittedly, the titles at the moment are a bit weak, but it plays most PS2 games and the future looks promising. The graphics are far better. Oh, and it cures cancer, I'm not making it up."
5,Forget everything and go get one!,"Despite all the talking about its price been ""too high"", this is an excellent game machine. As any other video game console in its first year, all you need to do is wait for the upcoming christmas season to get a lot of new games.Sony has developed the new multimedia center for your home, and the Playstation 3 has already replaced my PS2, my upscaling DVD player and my wireless media player under the TV (talk about costly devices!).I highly recommend you go out and buy one. Then you can do the talk."
1,Same old stuff in a new shiny wrapper,Graphics look better than a PS2. Gameplay worse due to handicapped controllers. Runs too hot. If Blu-Ray doesn't win format war PS3 will become a Betamax that can play videogames.
2,Game system Blu Ray is Crap,"Ok so I have one of these over hyped PS3's. Its okay but not too impressed. Not very many good games available but it is nice to use the backward compadibility. As fas as the Blu Ray part of it, not impressed at all. I don't see any difference than a normal Dvd. I guess if you have a Plasma TV it might improve but I doubt it. Bottom line its a let down, its not worth the price and Xbox 360 is the better way to go. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!"
3,Don't be misled on this Playstation,"You may think this is a good deal at $499, but realize that Sony just admitted they are discontinuing this model (that's why a price drop), and the new one will have a bigger drive and more ""up to date"" features."
1,Even after a year,"Even after a year the PS3 is out performed, out classed, out gamed, and lasted by the Xbox-360. Two of my friends have returned their PS3's at least three times with one guy getting a rental game stuck in the drive after the PS3 crashed and shut off to a right light of death. The Xbox 360 I have however is still flawless with better graphics, performance, multiplayer, and games than PS3. Do yourself a favour get a PSP and an Xbox 360 and your set."
1,nothing new just high tech...,"My hubby bought it.. I played it was nothing exciting really. The graphics are good but the games are the same.Buttons/Remotes the same.. nothing new just blu ray disc and better graphics. I dont have use for blu ray. I dont care much about graphics as long as the movies have good stories and characters and the games are fun.. I guess I dont need expensive gadget to entertain myself. This system is more likely for hardcore high tech gamers, definitely not for non gamers like me and most definitely not for kids. I have a 5 yr old son he doesnt even know what ps3 is...."
2,"overengineered and overhyped, missing the point","I have played it at work. While the graphics are really good and hd output is detailed, in no way do the shipping games take advantage of the expensive technology in this console. They probably won't for another year or so. It also does not play many of the older PS games as Sony had originally promised. It is way overpriced for technology that does not increase the gameplay and fun. Yes they have more resolution, faster graphics but it does not equal better gameplay.Then the console itself is a huge hunk of swooping black glossy plastic and placing it in your living room make you look like a dork with questionable taste.For truly innovative approach to games I will look at the Wii. Or for the same price as this doorstopper I can get the Wii and a more mature Xbox360, so you can both have family-friendly innovation and cutting edge games for adults."
2,I have had vicious problems,"I will only go into details in the comments, but this PS3 has caused me and particularly my daughter vicious problems due to the extreme heat this baby produces. I waited in line for three months and for what? A NIGHTMARE JOURNEY INTO CONSOLE HELL.I am still attempting to get a new unit or some money after my old one experienced what Amazon will only allow me to call ""overheating problems"". It is a sad day for America when one of our fine companies produces such a product for the untutored masses like myself.I did enjoy playing a game while the unit was still operable and because it has 60 jigs of space I could have used it to store all my personal data, that is if it still worked. But it broke the first day and I could not even save my game!REVIEW CONTINUED IN COMMENTS"
1,Warning: Overheats!!,"As most people know, these gaming machines get hot. Microsoft addressed the problem with a 3YEAR WARRANTY on the 360. Sony remains in denial. Our machine overheated and stopped working after @ 2 weeks of use total...over a one-year period. Sony's games just aren't as good as WII and 360, so nobody played this console much. With mediocre software and delicate hardware, I recommend that you wait until Sony addresses all their problems and focuses on the consumer, not the stock value."
3,"Minor Gliches, poor launch lineup","Well it's finally here and after all the hype Sony has over promised and under delivered once again.Only supports the newest HDTV, if yours is a couple of years old you will be playing games in 480p not 1080i, backwards compatibility is glitchy, online is just OK, and the launch line up is not very good.Launch titles are mostly games that are already available for other systems and only a few exclusives. Except for the Resistance the exclusives are not very good at all [...]Don't get me wrong, the PS3 is worth getting but it is not the killer system Sony is making it out to be.For now I will be very happy with my Wii and 360, I'll wait until there are better games available before getting my PS3."
1,product presentation was not present.,"my product came shipped in a box,wrapped in protective bubble wrap.so upon seeing that the item was wrapped in bubble wrap i assumed that it was in a suitable state to presnt as a gift,so i retaped the box and presented to my 7 year old grand daughter on christmas day and to my dismay the product she unwrapped was damaged with a small dent on the front near on/off button dirty and dusty and smeared with fingerprints and some sort of sticky substance.i basically had to pretend to leave the house to return the product for her.when in fact i had to clean the console which was filthy!after about a 30 minute cleaning i presented back to her,(didnt want to see her cry all day-especially on christmas day).the product looked as if it was in someone,s attic or seldom used garage."
5,BEST TOY ON THE MARKET,i've been playin madden on it for 24hrs straight...cant get enough..and the blu ray movies look unbelievable on here!!! If anyone still wants one I have one i'm trying to sell but dont want to bother with the ebay mess
3,"Good value for technology, not great for a game system yet.","A good value if you are interested in the technology included.(HD, Blue Ray DVD player, etc) If you are interested in using it as a video game machine it is definitely lacking right now, but I am sure it will improve in a year. Graphics are incredible but doesn't blow away the 360 so far. I was fortunate to get one at launch but I play my other systems more often so I am selling it and will buy it back in a year when it will be cheaper and have a better lineup of games."
1,"Yellow Light, Blinking Red Light!!!!!","Everything is great until..... Yellow Light, Blinking Red Light!!!!!.... sent it to sony to get it serviced... they returned a refurbished one back.... 1 year later... the SAME problem...Contacted Sony again, and they sent the same reply back to me. Gave me a Copy and Paste answer and told me to get it serviced AGAIN!!! for $150...Save your money and buy the Slim... its been a year so far and no problem."
2,An impressive machine...but,"I bought my PS3 3 months ago and at the beginning, it was perfect, however since the last Saturday the system didn't recognize any disc (DVD, CD, PS2 or PS3) and now I have to pay for the reparation. BTW I'm not in the States, that is way I can't claim the warranty. So be careful, the PS3 is a great console, but Sony didn't take care of all the details. Those of you who live in the US or in Europe, can claim the warranty, however you can't help the frustration and all the upsetting process of sending the defective PS3 in order to get a new one."
4,just needs more great game titles,"Currently I own an Xbox 360, and there's only 2 reasons why I still have it: 1) Halo 3, and 2)once i'm done with Halo 3, I will trade in my 360 and all the games and extras for a PS3. Why? Last Christmas my original 360 dies on me, one of the many having the now infamous 3 red rings of light. Since then Microsoft has extended the warranty and established a billion dollar repair and return setup. The games are very good, but the hardware problems are totally unacceptable.So this Christmas I'll trade in my 360 for the PS3. Not only are some good games coming out, the Playstation Network is beginning to shape up real nice (it helps that it's also FREE). Also, the Blu-ray movies are gaining alot of momentum, and the wireless networking will save me alot of trouble when I upgrade to a new Mac--no more wires anywhere! It's better to save up and have something that will serve more than one purpose, instead of waiting for M$ to send you a replacement!"
5,Excellent home entertainment system,"PS3 is more than a gaming console. It is a whole entertainment system in one. You can play games, watch movies dvd or blue ray, surf net, watch pictures. I like the console. The picture output is as you expect from a blue ray hd player."
5,60gb is the right system,"I was shopping for a used PS3, and this is the best one, I believe. This and certain 80gb are the only ones that are backwards capable. Why Sony discontinued that, I don't know for sure, but my guess is that this will become a collectors item someday."
5,"If you like games, get a PS3............Period","I've had a PS3 since launch and it has the most bang for the buck out of all systems period. Blu-ray is amazing and games are finally starting to trickle out. Wii is a good ""family"" system but kinda leaves hardcore gamers left out. X360 is also a good system but is not so good reliability wise. The PS3 is very reliable and super quiet. It may not be selling as good as the Wii(grandparents/soccermoms) but it IS the better system. Just looks at the game lineups. PS3 wins handsdown. There is no comparison."
3,I love HD-DVD and even I'm saying this is a great blu-ray player,"This machine has no games that stand out, everything either looks better or plays better on X360. I'm a film buff, there a few companies that for some reason won't support HD-DVD (I'll never understand why 'cause when you use blu-ray you're paying a rival film company YOU HEAR THAT DISNEY AND 20TH CENTURY), so if you're looking for the best blu-ray player in the market, here you go!. HD-DVD might have better HD content, but this machine's just cheaper.Best, E!"
4,amazing,"this thing is amazing, its better than the wii by far and the xbox 360 isnt even in this things league. the graphics are amazing and you get blu ray. for the price, it is so worth it"
5,I love my PS Triple,"A lot of people say it doesn't have that many great games right now, but that works out fine for me since I don't have lots of free time. I have just enough to keep me entertained. There are so many great ones coming this Fall too, I don't know which ones I should get because I want them all! It's a very reliable alternative to the 360."
5,All About PLAYSTAION 3,"First how the PLAYSTAION 3 is awesome. Is how AWESOME it looks. A Toatally black game system are the awesomest ever.The only bad one is the 40GB. Get the 60GB or 80GB. Because they have more space. And the controller is awesome and is epsically for Wii lovers. Because you pull,Tug,drift and ,grab.Ok theres another awesome part BLU-RAY a full 1080p perfect pitcure. The games are BLU-RAY and also the movies.That probally Explanes the price. And Instead 2player games how about 4player. Just like the Xbox 360 you can go online and hook up with friends. And a new button playstaion sybol witch is the homing button. Used to go to the playstaion home. And if I did'nt tell you this BLU-RAY also has more space for more bonus features. The PLAYSTAION 3 also plays standerd DVDs for extra awesomeness.And how they write PLAYSTAION 3 is awesome to. Thats all I have to say. P.S. a'll write a sequel to this."
5,Finally!!,"After 7 hours waiting on a line in front of Target, only to be told they only were getting in 6 units to sell and I was number 8 in line was a huge dissappointment since my husband was in Iraq serving our country and all I wanted to do was get him his PS3 for Christmas... The first two people on line was going to sell it on Ebay, mind you I was upset since I had my personal reason to buy this for my soldier...Thank god I did wait and found it on here to buy and was able to ship it to us through APO(we just moved to Germany due to his new duty station). This keeps him busy in his game room after work for hours and I can watch my shows without any interuption on the big screen in our family room! Ha!! Great graphics, worth the money since we owned all Playstation consoles, huge upgrade for Playstation and couldn't be happier... HOOAH!!"
2,Diseño horripilante,"Que los diseñadores de SONY tomen algun curso para que la siguiente PS4 sea bonita, con buen diseño, porque la PS3 dejenme decirles que es lo mas feo en consolas... el control es una alegoria a la ""feitud"" (no creo que esa palabra exista)... Con respecto a lo demas, pues no se! Utilizo 100% una X360"
5,Great buy.,I wanted this older unit specifically so I could play all previous systems games and have not had problems or any conflicts as of yet.
4,Can't wait to get one,"I do not have one yet, but I've played at wal-mart a few times and I was impressed. It did not wow me, but thet graphics were pretty nice (NBA 07 had some shiny people in that game). Personally the launch titles are not that great to me, but I know sony will come out with better games. I am a playstation fan so I am definetly going to buy this sytem. I'm also going to get a wii for my brother, but this a PS3 review so never mind. Now all three systems are out, and all of them are good. It will be ineteresting who turns out to be the victor...probably sony."
1,xbox 360 is better gaming,why get a ps3 when you can get an xbox 360...you can play all the same games + halo3.. if i were you i would get a xbox 360 elite and then a ps3..for the best gaming experience..buy an xbox 360 elite
5,playstation 3 is the best !!!,"playstation 3 is the best the graphics are good i mostly own most of the games foe it and its cool !! i have a 60gb one,i also own a ps2 slim a psslim silver and a psone.i own most of the things for it too its the best"
1,Too expensive,"I have one thing to say about Sony's PS3. EXPENSIVE! I own a PS2 and it's a reliable system. PS3 is just a PS2 with a new design, better graphics, and can play Blu-Ray discs. Why buy this when you can buy a Nintendo Wii or XBOX 360. The Wii and 360 are a few hundred dollars less than a system with better graphics! If you want to get a PS3, you get about the same entertainment with a Wii or 360."
2,"Not enough Games, Too many dollars","If you are looking for a Blu-ray player right now, then get the PS3 as it is the cheapest player out there and does so much more. If you are looking for a game machine, PS3 just doesn't cut it right now. $500 wasn't worth it when the PS3 launched for the 20GB and it isn't worth it for the 60GB either. Sony is even discontinuing the model and will most likely bring down the 80GB to the same price. So you might as well wait until there are more games for the system worth playing.Get a Wii for a different experience to tide you over until FFXIII, Medal Gear Solid 4, etc come out. Then Uncharted and others will be cheaper and you might be able to get a 120GB PS3 for $499 by that time. I wouldn't recommend the 360 until they get rid of that internal design flaw. Wii has Smash Brothers, Mario Galaxy, Metroid 3, and many other with a whole new way to play that can make parties a blast and even get your parents to play. It would be a much safer bet."
1,"Never works Playstation,","Bought playstation,has never work proberly,always broken,I think sony playstation 3 is a load of junk ,real disappointment,and frustration filled time,do your self a favor buy some other gaming unit save your self a big headach and save 499.00 dollars"
5,PS3,"The ps3. It is the god of all video games. It smashes the XBOX 360 no question. If anyone thinks that the PS3 is a bad console then they don't know what they are talking about. With the internet access and the Blu-ray disk drive, it far surpasses the XBOX 360's HD DVD drive(which costs 200 bucks). If you are going to dis the PS3 then at least learn the facts about it. If you aren't a die hard PLAYSTATION fan then don't even talk about the PS3. Although the graphics arent the best NOW, they will get better. Remember how the PS2 looked when it came out? Sure it was better than PS1, but if you would play it now it would be pretty bad compared to what the PS2's potential is now. Just be patient and wait, the PS3 has just been born, its only a baby."
5,beats xbox 360 any day,"best hard core gaming system ever. i have both an xbox 360 and ps3 and i can't remember the last time i turned the 360 on. the ps3 is an all around better system: web surfing, wifi, hard drive space, 1080p capability, and motion sensing controls to name a few. many argue that no good games have come out and they are quite mistaken oblivion, resistance, and motorstorm are a couple representing the pinnacle of their respective categories: rpg, fps, and racing. so sell that hunk of junk called an xbox and pick up the 60 gb ps3."
5,The Ultimate Entertainment Gaming System,"The Sony PlayStation 3. The Superior gaming console, the number 1 Blu-ray disc player ever (because it actually has a high performance video processor in it), a media center itself and the elegant design. What more can you ask? Well I don't know you tell me. Because if you are questioning this console. DX got two words for you! Well about the games line up. We all just need to wait. Quality takes time. XBOX 360's games are just a collection of glitches. XOBX 360's games perform a little bit faster yes but they have alot of glitches and some decrease in image quality. I'm getting an XBOX 360 because of some stupid game defectors like Ace Combat 6 Fires Of Liberation. Don't forget to pre-order Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII Versus, Tekken 6, Gran Turismo 5 and Grand Theft Auto 4."
4,60GB PS3 - Waiting for sports games,"The new features (HDD, tilt-sensitive wireless controller, bluetooth, wi-fi, etc) are impressive - a potentially great machine.The game system has lots of features, but it appears there are some difficulties with programmers utilizing them. Madden '08 for PS3 has a 30 fps framerate - the comparable Xbox 360 version uses 60 fps, and the difference is obvious in a side-side comparison."
4,So So,"I have both systems, Xbox 360, and PS3 just got it yesterday, I loved the 360 until after 4 months it died, yes the ring of death, 3 times it has gone to a tech for repairs now, quality is really bad, it heats up and freezes, but it really beats PS3 on multimedia by a long way, in streaming media from PCs, streaming is a lot more efficient than taking a usb drive o a CD to the PS3. On the playing part Fall of Men looks great in graphics; the sound part not as good as Gears of War or Call Of Duty 3 on the Xbox; it was dissapointing really I had higher hopes for the PS3. Good points its thats quiet and it looks better quality; but it produces lots of heat too and updating it to the latest firmware update 1.7 took about 40 minutes. Like other people have said in other reviews it's up to you which one you like most, multimedia streaming media center with high end gaming or you want a quality next gen game station, it all ends up to the games also."
3,Excellent Bluray and upconverting DVD player - no games yet so I can't say how it will do as a console.,"As a game console, there really is no real reason to buy the PS3 yet - unless you really like Resistance and have a large PS1/PS2 library.As a Bluray/DVD player though it is excellent. Except for one thing - for some unknown reason Sony decided not to include RF/IR capabilities and you must either use the controller or Sony's own Bluray remote. This is inexcusable especially since Sony obviously wants to use the PS3 as a Trojan Horse to get Bluray into livingrooms. The PS3 is the only thing that I own that cannot be controlled by my universal remote control. That may or may not matter to you but it really annoys me."
2,Dissapointed,"I'm a little afraid to use this product now.Reason:Upon first using it - it felt hot to touchI did a little research on the internet and some comments were a gfci should never be warm.I emailed the manufacturer - and must admit they were very prompt in their reply.The responder said that it was normal to feel hot/warm, with the caveat that this was a portable device and to pull it when not in use.I wanted to use it for a prolonged period of time and now am worried about letting it stay in an outlet for too long."
5,GOOD PRODUCT,"Product works as advertised. I tested it! In addition to providing more outlets, installation is a SNAP. You do not have to do any wiring at all! This alone makes this a GREAT product. Every bathroom and kitchen should have one, not to mention any and all outdoor outlets. You will have to remove it from the outdoor outlet when you are finished, because it is not waterproof, but it still works!"
4,Great for Fish Tank,"Perfect for my fish tank. When I originally plugged it in, every time my heater turned on/off this would trigger. Using a multimeter, I determined that the heater wasn't shorting, and I thought I'd have to send this back.I plugged an extension cord into this, and all my aquarium equipment into the extension cord, and I no longer have the problem. Since GFCI and Surge Protection are different, I actually get a wider range of protection by using both, too."
2,Great but missing parts,I ordered this thinking it was brand new and unopened. However the package for the figure was glued shut and clearly open. I am also completely MISSING the arm piece that is suppose to be with this toy.
1,ripping cd s great,great ideabut what a nightmare because it only works with ms media center and we all no how well that worksripping bulk cd at one time great if there is not very many scratches on them is greatother then that it needs to be modified there are groups on web that will do this to make it better
1,Not a XL1B3.......,"What a shame, the XL1B3 from amazon just a repackage XL1B2 with updated Vista software. the manufacture date is also old."
2,"Not different from its predecessor, XL1B2",... which only cost 199$ a couple of months ago.The XL1B3 costs 399$- more than double.Huh?
5,Listening to the voices of kids!,"I initially read this book as a study group member. I subsequently bought 5 more copies to share with teachers. The words of wisdom from these students would benefit any first time teacher from Elementary School to High School, and would benefit any teacher who needs a reminder of what to do or not do in order to have a productive mutually respected school year!"
4,Insight into students,This is a great view into the adolescent mind from adolescents. A wonderful set of voices to use when reviewing your school year or preparing for the new year. A recommendation to anyone who wants to reach students through relationships as well as rigor and relevance.
3,"Helpful Worksheets, not so helpful comments","I thought this book was good because it gives you a look at high school students from their perspective. Many of the comments and advice in this book, however, are common sense.The best thing about this book is that it has many worksheets for you and for students...such as surveys for the first day of school, worksheets to make sure you are grading fairly, etc."
4,Fires in the Bathroom,"Research has shown a persistent divide among teachers and students across the country, and Fires in the Bathroom did a good job at specifically addressing how the students feel and are driven. It also provided, from the students perspectives, many solutions as to what would work for them. This made it particularly apparent however, the complexities that the teacher would presume to encounter in his or her role. The book in itself hopefully will have some positive effects on teenagers that educators are wanting to listen and learn what they are about. It is a book I would recommend to new and seasoned teachers both, to either become or reacquaint themselves with the diversity of students and how much of an impact a teacher can make in their lives."
3,Revenge is sweet,"This book is a good example of your average revenge novel. Our hero is Mulligan, a man with extensive military and spy training. He happens into the middle of a double-cross involving two factions of the Mafia. He ends up with $5,000,000 of the mobs money. The mob finds out who took the money, kills his sister and the war is on. This is a brisk, fast paced read but just doesn't quite make it to greatness."
5,Best book I've ever read.,This was by far one of the best books I have ever read. Everyone I have loaned it to has agreed. You are so involved with all the characters you don't want the book to end. Better have a whole box of tissues ready!
4,Great Book!,This book is very enjoyable. I picked it up for summer reading and could not put it down.
5,Georgia Bockoven's best yet!,"Although I've read all of Georgia Bockoven's books, ""the Beach house"" was her best yet, ITs a very well written book and you fall in love with the characters."
2,"Nice idea, poor implementation","We've been very happy with our VTech 2431 single-line 2.4MHzphone system for the past few years, so now that we havethree lines this looked like just the right thing.Unfortunately this system appears to have been designed by acompletely different team. The handsets are very large (toolarge to fit into a pocket), the menus are more difficult touse, the speed-dial feature is extremely clumsy, and thesignal quality is very poor, with lots of hissing in thebackground. We've sent this one back and replaced it with atwo-line VTech 20-2431 system, which is much more like theoriginal 2431 and doesn't suffer from the problems of the40-2421 series."
4,excellent for a small business,"We run a four person business and have used this system for three years. We have had to replace batterys, (it starts to hiss and life is measured in minutes) but battery replacement is what I would expect for an office cordless. We use the hold features and the intercom / call transfer all day long. While this is not an inexpensive phone, I found nothing comparable in the four line offerings. We currently have five handsets and will continue to add more."
5,Home Office,"I have been using this unit since it came out. I worked flawlessly in my old house. I moved to a larger, older home and coverage is not as good. I am considering buying another unit to see if they will both work and overlap.This system really works well, but could conflict with home wireless systems."
2,Ripples (A story of Garth Brooks),"Although I found the characters in the story of Madeline and Ryan to be very interesting, I was disappointed in the story because I did not find it believable. I am very interested in this subject and have read many many books about past live regressions. In each previous experience, it seemed like the memories were like jig saw puzzles where the party was trying to put the fragments of their past lives together and make sense out of their recalls. Never have I encountered in any of my other readings, including Edgar Cayce (who was the lst and best, in my opinion) did the subject recall entire lives from start to finish with every little innuendo in between. Ms. Smedley is asking us to believe that she recalled entire dialogue with her past love (Garth Brooks) from 300 years ago over a span of many years, as well as that of other members of the family, including their thoughts and feelings at the time. I find that a stretch of imagine, to say mildly."
1,They shouldn't break when you try to open them.,"Do not buy these. Go to a different site and get them. You may pay a little more but it's worth it. I don't think it's too much to ask that you be able to open the cases for the first time without them breaking. I bought 200 of them and I'd say almost half of them broke. On most of them, one of the tabs broke off which means you could still close it but only one of the clasps was holding it. On other ones, the case itself split. These are too cheaply made and should not be sold to consumers."
3,NOT THE GREATEST PRODUCT,"I BOUGHT A CASE OF THESE THOUGHT THE PRICE WAS GREAT AND IT IS IF ALL 100 ARE GOOD,PROBLEM IS THESE ARE EXTREMELY CHEAP CASES IN PRICE AND QUALITY.CAME WITH CRACKED AND BROKEN CASES THE TABS THAT HOLD THE CASE SHUT BREAK OFF WHEN YOU OPEN THE CASE SO NOW THEY WONT STAY CLOSED.BY THE TIME I SORTED THROUGH ALL 100 CASES 34 OF THEM WERE JUNK AND ABOUT 4 MORE WERE QUESTIONABLE.SO TO SUM IT UP,LESSON LEARNED YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND THEY WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER DIME OUT OF ME."
1,A good book if you happen to like the author's politics,"""Patriarchy"" ""American imperialism"" and other post-modern and feminist political buzzwords ruin this book just as much as they ruined Professor Stasz's ""Jack London's Women."" The Professor's statements (paraphrased) that without Charmian, his mother, his nanny, et al, the world would never have heard of Jack London is bunk, and insulting to a genius of American letters. Further, her baseless assertion that London's first wife and second wife were happier after his death because he was gone from their lives is wishful thinking. I think his widow might have begged to differ with the good Professor. Professor Stasz but destroys her credibility as a scholar by continually showcasing her assumptions about a man she never knew, colored by her politics. I'll never waste my time on her work again."
5,One of my top 10 albums of all time...,"For me, the original recordings (1972) of these great songs will always be the best. I literally wore this album out when I was in college. Rex and Neal's harmonies on these excellent songs, coupled with their wonderful guitar work have withstood the test of time -- thirty years later they are just as moving as they were back in the 70's. For many years, each trip to the CD store would start with a browse of the A-artists, but I could never find this CD. I finally tried their website (aztectwostep.com) and found I could order one there. I received an eMail from Rex himself and a signed CD a few days after placing my order. If you can find this CD, buy it and you'll treasure it as I have."
4,"Good rake, but awfully expensive","This rake was purchased to pull leaves from under bushes in our fall garden. The newer design works fairly well at preventing leaf clogs, but is not perfect. We purchased the smaller, less expensive, model to see how well it works. It is too small for large cleanup projects, and we are not sure that the bigger one is worth purchasing"
4,Simple yet thought provoking,"I am an Asian who is exposed to different kinds of Buddhism and often puzzled by its different school of thoughts. I now live in Thailand and work with the Thais 24/7. In this book, Ravi primarily describes the kind of Buddhism practised in Thailand and it's neighbouring countries. However, he also briefly yet abtly pointed the root beliefs and principles of main stream buddhistic philosophy. I must conclude that Ravi has scholistically pointed out and compared the differences between Christianity and Buddhism and present HOPE, in which the first offers, to the reader. Having been a buddhist half of my life and now living among millions of them, I must admit the latter's philosophy is one which offers hope only to a hopeless future, and its followers pursuing, ultimately, nothing. More could be said but the advise is, get a copy and read it with an open mind."
1,Misleading and totally biased.,"All I read was the intro, some parts of the book here and there, and the epilogue... nothing else I needed to read to understand that this book was totally biased on Christianity against Buddhism. So I put it aside and just laughed to come here on Amazon. Unlike everyone who thinks this is a gem, I am not gullible enough to think likewise.If Buddha and Jesus met, there would be total silence. That's all. Both individuals know exactly who they are, and I'm sure they will never engage in an intellectual discussion to show who is better. Two beings of love cannot talk with the intellect, only heart to heart conversation is possible. Both beings know the truth in their own way. However, the author is all about philosophy and intellect. Clearly he needs to explore compassion and love a lot more than I thought.Anyhow, good book to laugh at; that's all how I take it."
1,Not very informative,"The key weakness in ""The Lotus and the Cross"" is the lack of information about either Buddhism or Christianity. The book seems to be written for Christians who want to learn more about Buddhism. However, the book spends no time introducing Buddhist or Christian ideas before debating them. Most of the points of debate fit into a larger framework in each religion, but this framework is not presented for either Buddhism or Christianity.If anyone is interested in learning more about Buddhism (in a concise form), the book Buddhism A Very Short Introduction, by Damien Keown, is short and inexpensive (maybe a little dry, though). The book Buddhism Plain & Simple, by Steve Hagan is also good. Perhaps a Christian reviewer could recommend a book that gives a brief introduction to Christianity."
1,A cheap shot.,A condemnation of Buddhism by a Christian insider who obviously has little experience with Buddhism.
2,Interesting idea...,"The book is short, interesting and flows pretty well with rather simple concepts so its easy to read.If you are a Christian who believes everyone should be Christian, accept Christ and such you will like the book since it is essentially a ""sales tool"" intended to steer people away from Buddhism toward Christianity.If you are agnostic, you might find the book interesting as it does touch on both faiths/religions/beliefs/whatever even if geared toward delivering the reader to Christ.If you are Buddhist (like me) you will see it for what it is, accept that the author only wants to ""save"" people and probably means no harm."
4,"A good, quick overview of Buddhism","What a great book and an easy read. For those who would like to start reading books by this author, but are intimidated because of how intense some of his other books are - this book is for you. I look forward to more of Dr Zacharias' books. I learned much about the Buddha and how stark the differences are between Buddhist and Christians. The book focuses more on Jesus asking Buddha about his beliefs and stances than the other."
1,A misleading characterization of the Buddha and Buddhism,"Anyone familiar with the basic story, tenets and spiritual principles of Buddhism would feel deep sorrow for how profoundly Zacharias misrepresents them. This sort of propaganda is disturbing. I invite anyone interested in learning about the ineptitude of Christian interpretations of other faiths to read this book."
1,Wasted Opportunity,"This author is not qualified to speak for either person he represents in this book.The 'book' itself is itself more of a script for a play you might see put on in a church basement by the youth group than a book. In the forward, the author says that he spent 'scores of hours' studying Buddhism. Broken down, that translates to, at the very least, 60 hours. Not nearly enough, in my estimation, to be putting words in the mouth of the Buddha. And the insulting and belittling fashion in which he portrays Jesus is also disconcerting. With the audience Mister Zacharias commands, I was disappointed with the squandered opportunity. This had the potential to be something special but, in the end, it's wrong-headed & needlessly sneering."
1,Buddha and Paul; NOT Buddha and Jesus,"As a Christian, I found this book more than a little disturbing. It is not a dialogue between the Buddha and Jesus: It is a dialogue between the Buddha and St. Paul, posing as Jesus.Zacharias' conflation of the personalities and teachings of Jesus and St. Paul is intellectually dishonest and theologically untenable. What Zacharias ends up preaching would be better termed ""Paulianity,"" a theology in which Paul substitutes in toto for Jesus Christ.While Paul's message about the Risen Christ is of course central to our understanding of Jesus' living ministry during his time on Earth, Zacharias commits a grave error, and a gross simplification of Christianity, by presenting Paul and Jesus, and their respective teachings, as one and the same."
1,A shallow conversation,"Too short, too one sided (Jesus dominates the conversation). Worst of all it is a lecture by Jesus to Buddha filled with Bible quotations, not a conversation between equals, and a bit patronizing."
3,A nice fictionalized account,This is a small (undersized) book involving an imaginary dialogue between Jesus and Buddha. The author spent some time visiting with with monks and students of Buddhism in their temples in researching for this book. He offers some very interesting insights and deep thinking into the fallacies of Buddhism through this little `play.'
1,If you know ANYTHING about Buddhism don't bother with this,I was recommended this book by a Pentecostal colleague who thought I might enjoy it once he learned I was Buddhist. I was let down. The author writes from the extreme Christian view- no one is right other than Jesus & Christianity. It was an argument not a talk & it was an insult to anyone who has studied both. Sad. I will be selling it here cheap if you really want to try it. :)
4,THE KNOT BOOK,"I FOUND THE ILLUSTRATIONS EASY TO FOLLOW IT GAVE YOU WAYS TO USE KNOTS, BREAKING STRENGHTS OF KNOTS AND SOME HISTORY OF SOME KNOTS IT IS WORTH BUYING FROM BEGINNER TO INTERMEDIATE."
5,Great Album!,"This is an awsomw Now!album but its missing Britney Spears,Jojo,Lindsay Lohan,&Ashanti but its still well worth the money I hope Now 20s as good as this is! Must have better than some now albums.......Peace!"
2,Relient K gone mainstream???,"Most of the songs on this album are worth listening to, especially Relient K's ""By My Escape"". However, I hate to see that they've gone mainstream. Now that they're on MTV, this NOW album, etc. most people don't realize they're a Christian band. Personally, I liked it better when they were less popular."
1,...,"Who else is getting sick of this crap? Now that's what I call music 1-19. When will this end? Why don't you just burn a CD illegally off the internet or something? Why pay 20 bucks for this CD? Plus, it's not like these songs are very good. Most of these songs are already way over played on the radio and definitely don't need any more attention. Why not draw attention to great bands like ThousandFootKrutch or maybe LuckyBoysConfusion, instead of this junk? I have ONE Now, and that's the original, which I like about 6 songs on, because I like that mid-90's music. But this, THIS.. this is just crap.."
1,Please stop this insanity!!!,"It's just absurd that every time a new NOW (That's What I Call Trash) compilation comes out, it sells like hot cakes with free naked pictures of a pregnant Britney Spears taking a dump on Jessica Simpson. They usually hit #1 on the Billboard charts or at least get somewhere in the top 10. And that's just nonsense people.Sure, it takes the people who buy this album to remind the people that don't, why they didn't. It's all you generic brand namers that make indie music and underground music sound so damn good. And so much better.So thank you for reminding me why I hate KROQ and KIIS FM and MTV and VH1 and BET and all the other stupid channels and radio station that plays the same things over and over and over again.In closing, to all those who bought this album,Thank you for living in the box. Living outside the box is so much better without you here.Sincerely,me"
1,Where is Mariah Carey???? #1 song for 8 weeks!?!?!?!,"This CD is garbage, I returned it to the store!"
3,An average Now compilation.,"I think this is one of the better Now compilations to be released in recent times, but I think some artists were left off that should have been on here. Also, some of these songs have been way overplayed yet again (I guess that means they are hits, so then it would be appropriate to include them here)Great tunes (although most were overplayed): Hollaback Girl, Switch, Oh, Mockingbird, Girl, La Tortura, Baby I'm Back, Breathe (Anna is actually really good), Incomplete, Let Me GoI would say if you are not a fan of pop, you most likely wouldn't care for this CD since it's almost all in that genre. Overall, 10 out of 20 songs doesn't really seem to be worth a purchase for me, but it has a better chance of being purchased than the last Now CD."
1,Bad,"Do you people actually call this ""music"" I find it hard to call ""songs"" like ""Hollaback Girl"" music."
3,I keep listening to it....,"You know, like all of these compilation CD's, there's stuff on there that I don't like, but I like about 30 percent of the songs on it, and for some reason I like that 30 percent enough to keep on listening to the CD. I've got a feeling that there's something on here for everyone cause there's a lot of variety, that's for sure."
3,Only a few goodies here.....,"This NOW! disc is on the tip of the ""being boring"" iceberg. There are some good hits here such as ""Speed of Sound"" by Coldplay. Otherwise, this disc continues on with the flat and mundane pop music we have come to know and love. I do like the edited version of ""Hollaback Girl"" just because of all of the weird noises she uses to cover up the bad words. How funny! The Backstreet Boys' ""Incomplete"" is excellent as well. The NOW! series really needs to do away with the overrated R&B and rock music, and put some real art on to their CDs. Maybe #20 will be the charm."
4,Almost Perfect,"Well, I thought that this CD is going to be perfect for my cousin with a CD player for christmas. Everything about it was perfect but one thing. After she opened it we thought we should test it to see if the CD player worked. The CD player did work but while we where listining to it I noticed that this is a kids CD and it was a little bad for children because it was unapproriate for childeren. I think it sould be for an older age. But it is still a great CD!"
3,Not Bad,"I think this is a decent collection of music that has come out of late. It is very juvenile on part of every person to randomly diss it because of the pop influences. With songs by artists like Bobby Valentino,The Killers, Coldplay, Gorillaz,3 Doors Down it wins 3 stars."
2,what a waste of $13.29,"Who care's about the Now cds all they have is songs people already bought when their ablums were just coming out. The songs I like are ""Incomplete"" by The Backstreet Boys and ""let me go"" by 3 Doors Down. The rest are mostly rap I hate rap cause it's just getting old."
1,Now that is what i call Crap,"Why does anyone need to buy any cd in this stuipd series all the songs all played to death on radio and mtv when they do play videos early in the moringing. All these cd's prove is how much maintstream pop, rock, and hip hop music sucks now a days. If any band or singer is on any of these cds that you have liked for along time and now has become famous now then this means that they are now sell outs because they all on these cds. Also these cd's or for the cheapskate walmart shopper who does not like to listen to whole complete good cds and for people who think Coldplay is too edgey."
4,It's Money Worth spent,"Don't you just love when you get a new cd and you can't stop listening to it. I do, especially from Now 19 it has lots of differnt music from pop to country to rap. The song Hollaback girl is spectacular and you can easily dance to it. Another song I like on this cd is Be my escape it has a really good beat and you can easily sing to the lyrics. One song i didn't like was Ordinary People by John legend it has a slow beat and i can't get into his voice. Another song i like is Let me Go it is a really good song. Another song i lke is Girlfight because you can dance to it and it is a funny song. I hope this advice helps you buy Now 19."
2,One of the WORST nows,"I only like 3 songs on here!! ""Let Me Go"", ""Feel Good Inc."" and ""Incomplete"" there's like barely Any rock on here!! I would never recommend this to anyone. Just wait and get the next now."
4,cool music,Nice collaberation of music that allows me to hear lots of cool songs without buying each CD just for the one or two songs that you really want!
5,perfect Now 20,"Now 20 is a little early 2 think about it, but s what?? I really think sum of these songs should be on it*Missy and ciara- lose control*DHT- listen 2 ur heart*Mariah carey- We Belong together*click 5- Just the girl*fat joe feat. NELLY- get it POpPiN*Rhianna- Padre replaYTHESE R JUST A FEW K BYE"
2,BACKSTREET BOYS [NOW]:WRONG!,"WHY ARE THE BACKSTREET BOYS ON HERE? IS IT STILL 1999?WHY IS THERE KEITH URBAN (COUNTRY) AND {EMINEM} ON THE SAME CD?NO MORE COUNTRY ON (NOW) PLEASE.DON'T YOU AGREE?WILL SMITH IS A (ACTOR NOW) NOT A RAP ARTIST.PUT ON A REAL RAP ARTIST LIKE SNOOP DOGG OR NAS!THE ONLY THING ON THIS CD THAT IS NOW IS ""GWEN STAFANI"",""EMINEM""AND ""DESTINY'S CHILD"".THIS [ANNA NALICK] IS ""RETIREMENT HOUSE"" MUSIC!{SHAKIRA} IS ""FINE"" BUT CAN SHE SING ""NO""![YOU GUYS CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS]BUT AT LEAST YOU DID NOT PUT ON BRITNEY SPEARS.THANK YOU![ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999]"
4,My Pick for 20,1. Cool-Gwen Stefani2. Shake it Off-Mariah Carey3. Because of You-Kelly Clarkson4. Like You-Bow Wow/Ciara5. Listen To Your Heart-D.H.T6. Don't Lie-The Black Eyed Peas7. Golddigger-Kanye West8. Pimpin All Over The World-Ludacris/Bobby Valentino9.

3,It Was Pretty Good,"1. Hollaback Girl: 1/52. Switch: 1/53. 1 Thing: 5/54. Oh: 5/55. Slow Down: 2/56. Mockingbird: 5/57. Girlfight: 1/58. Girl: 5/59. La Tortura: 4/510. Baby Im Back: 2/511. How to Deal: 5/512. Ordinary People: 5/513. Breathe: 5/514. Making Memories Of Us: 1/515. Incomplete: 1/516. Let Me Go: 5/517. Be My Escape: 4/518. Mr. Brightside: 5/519. Speed of Sound: 5/520. Feel Good Inc: 1/5Overall this complication was okay, it wasn't excellent or bad either just in the ballpark. I recommend this over Now 20 because this one has better songs. I don't like Now 20. I would buy Now 19 if I saw it used because then it wouldn't be so expensive geez Sony."
4,Good Variety of Songs,"This NOW cd has songs that everyone can agree on. From pop to country and everything in between. Almost everyone probably will say that there's at least one song on this cd that they don't mind or even like listening to. I know that upon first picking up the cd I was skeptical of buying a cd that had songs from Will Smith to Gorillaz because they're so far apart on the music genre scale, but this cd makes all of the songs work really well together."
5,Comprehensive research on the area.,Great resource. Research is outdated but gives a lot of the historical pinnings in a area which is still in it's infancy.
2,Good For A Time,"I don't always give low ratings. However, this book is long overdue a 2nd edition, and as it stands, it should not be relied upon as a ""state of the art"" book on childrens' eyewitness testimony.The progenitor of most of the scientific research on the subject, Elizabeth Loftus, has come under fire two years after the publication of this book, as the detractors (or uncritical believers) mounted a resurgent challenge to her work. A revision ought to include a critical reanalysis of these challenges, as well as another decade of subsequent psychological, experimental, and legal work in the area.The book is therefore of historical interest, but cannot stand alone in any clinic library."
4,The Knights Quest,"There is a sixteen year old named Brian who finally decides to become a knight,and goes on a guest.So one day he is greeted by a man named Tertius. He is telling Brian about how Merlins mistake on how he was suppose to give him the knowledge of magic. But instead he was given the power to know all about the future. I thought it was really good,because it had magicial spells and sword fighting,and jousting. It kinda remind me of the Harry Potter series because of the magic spells. I would reccomend this book to all my friends and yours."
5,Merlin's Mistake by Robert Newman,"OMG! This is one of the most wonderful books ever. If any fantasy loving person has not read this book, they really should!"
4,A welcome addition,"The updating of the story of the Pilgrim's Progress is long overdue. The sidebar comments are entertaining and informative. This book should be read before tackling Bunyan's original.I disagreed with comments that Bunyan was being ""anti-semitic"" in places. Bunyan disagreed with Judaism (and all religions besides his Protestantism), but his differences were theological, not racist.Other classics of this era should be updated to modern language!"
5,"Real Communication, Really Fast","Language Dynamics courses are the only courses I know of that are truly dedicated to effective and immediate communication in the target language. Academic courses often reflect the literary interests of professors, many of whom never had the experience of learning the target language as a second language. With these courses, you can hit the streets after every lesson knowing you can say more than you could yesterday."""
5,Impressive Score,Benjamin Frankel's score for THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE was one of the best things about that movie. This CD sounds great. The cover artwork is fantastic. So glad it was issued.
2,Unreliable and noisy,"What's with VTech? The first unit failed within a few months. Now, the replacement unit has terrible background noise, which is peculiar, since there are no other electronics in the room.The designers load many features on these phones, but they fail with the very basics... communication! Can't any of these high-tech companies produce a telephone that works?"
4,Solid 2-Line Wireless Phone - Recommended,"We have used this phone (two of these base units and fourVTech 20-2420 Accessory Handset for VT20-2400 Series Expandable Phones) for at least five years. Our luck has been somewhat better than other reviewers and we are mostly pleased with the system. Here are my observations:* Great battery life on the handset (2 hours of talk time)* Replacement batteries are easy to find* Good two line features (confrencing, hold, etc)* Caller ID* Answering SystemMy only complaint is that the handsets lose thier minds when dropped and take upwards of minute to recover.Has served us well for many years! Recommended"
2,Reception isn't as good as expected,As well when plugging in a headset to the handset there's an irritating high pitch noise that is unfixable.
1,Don't waste your time,I bought the base unit with two additional handsets. My wife and son thought the buttons were too hard to push. It didn't matter because one handset never worked. After about 2 days the display on another handset didn't work. Called Vtech and they could only suggest that I return it for a replacement. I did them one better. I returned it for a full refund.
2,Good phone but had problems after a year,Great range on phone. I found phone easy to use and like the display just fine - my 40 year old eyes didn't have a problem. The speaker phone has worked just great for me too. We purchased 3 phones a little over a year ago and now two of them sound very hollow and have some static. They need to be replaced but at $$$ each I'll probably look for another option. Initially loved phones but disappointed by short life.
2,"Constant Static, poor battery life","I really liked all the features of this phone. But, three most important features for me are sound quality, battery life and distance. Well, this phone failed on the first two. There was constant static on this phone; kind of like your radio is not exactly on the right station. Also, I charged the battery for over 12 hours on Sunday. By Thursday I was charging the battery again, and we had been on vacation those days and not at home! The distance quality seemed to be pretty good. I could go out in the yard and over to the neighbors house with it."
2,Not compatible with Mac Mini,"I've used this kvm switch with a couple PC's without issue but it will not work at all with my brand new Mac Mini. When I plug the USB cable into the Mac Mini I get a warning message that it is drawing too much power from the USB port so Mac OS X has decided to disable the port to protect my computer. I also tried to use a USB power splitter cable to try and draw power from two USB ports instead of one but I get the same warning.If you have a Mac Mini, do NOT buy this kvm switch."
3,Just OK....,"I've been using this switcher for a few months know to switch between 2 or 3 pc's with dual monitors.Generally, it works pretty well, but I have noticed that sometimes I have to reboot my PC's so that I can log into my PC's when they have been allowed to site overnight. For some reason, the USB keyboard and mouse just are not recognized by my PC's. It could be a problem with the PC, but regardless, it requires a hard boot to fix.This it not too big of a deal usually, but can be frustrating sometimes..."
1,Doesn't work with Nforce motherboards,"Only after purchasing one and fighting with skipping and sticking keystrokes for a day did I find out from Iogears tech support that not only does this KVM not work well with multimedia and internet style keyboards (and good luck finding a non-multimedia USB keyboard these days) but it also doesn't work with Nforce motherboards, regardless of version. Thats gotta be close to half the desktops that are made now-a-days that this KVM won't work with. As of this writing they do not have a firmware fix and no ETA on when one will be released. What would possess them to release a KVM in such a buggy state is beyond me."
4,No nonsense KVM switch,"Great buy, I have a mac,pc and vaio laptop and needed something to connect all three to my two 22"" monitors. This little gadget did the trick!"
4,Tech Support Woes,The switch now works as promised. Their tech support is horrible and just wants to RMA everything even though it works on an identical system they claimed it was bad. It took me 6 days worth of calls and having to go through the same tech support script with each person to get escalated to their development team to determine the issue. By the way the development team is in California and their Tech Support is not.
2,"Clean video output, but the keyboard and mouse emulation needs a LOT of help....","I have 3 machines with dual output, and finally wanted to take advantage of them. For a while I was using an old Linksys KVM to switch one monitor between the 3 computers and then a second dedicated monitor on the 'main' machine - it worked better than it sounds.The switch itself has nice video output. I don't see any ghosting or weird analog issues. What I do have a problem with is the keyboard and mouse output.I don't consider myself a gamer per se, but I do enjoy playing my Skyrim. Doing so is impossible on this switch. It is doing some kind of weird keyboard emulation that prevents or completely strips key strokes/key holds. The typematic (repeat) rate is HORRIBLY slow.Not to mention the switch seems to be dropping keystrokes while I am typing this review.I would NOT purchase this again."
4,MCSE Windows 2000 Professional - Study Guide (70-210),"Good book. However, the questions in this book are much easier than the actual exam questions. I read this book with the corresponding Exam Cram book and passed the exam on the first try. I also used many of the online practice tests available.Don't plan on passing the exam using this book alone. Study from other sources too!"
3,Helpful,"I have found Sybex books very helpful when preparing for MCSE certification exams. A combination of reading this book, hands on experience and taking transcender pretest exams helped me score a 900 on this exam in April of 2003.If you are pursuing your Windows 2000 MCSE a word of advice, don't stop and start. Set a goal with a time frame and get it done. It's much easier to pass the next exam when there isn't a large time gap between the previous."
2,Good information but....,I thought this book had good information but found it hard to read. I switched to Syngress study guide and found that book easy to read with plenty of good information to prepare you for the exam.
1,Just say no,"This book is a waste if you are going for the exam. It does nothing more than tell you click here and point there. It is totally superficial. It should be called how to get around in Windows 2000 professional. I cannot find any in depth explanations on such topics as RIS, compression, driver signing, sysprep, etc. All of this is on the exam. All most none of the discussion on these and many other topics will help you with the exam. I used the Exam Notes for NT 4.0 exams and they were useful, but this one seems to have been rushed to print without knowledge of the exam."
1,Not really and exam prep book,"This is a great book if you just want to learn about Windows 2000 - however it is definitely NOT an exam preparation book. It is like they have never even sat the exam. In the introduction they mention that this book is for people who already have a feel for Windows 2000 and this book would get your prepared - that is totally wrong. I can't recommend any other books - but perhaps pick up the Trancender cds - also don't forget to make sure you are up to speed with networking concepts - dns, dhcp, active directory etc."
5,Wonderful,"It's a difficult subject to study on your own, but this collection is excellent because many of the 40 texts are commentaries on some of the other texts. For example, six of the texts (50 pages) are on ""Parting from the Four Clingings"". Roughly 200 pages are devoted to Sangye Gompa's ""Public Explication of Mind Training"" and a companion text, Konchok Gyaltsen's ""Supplement to the Oral Tradition"".Every text is a wonderful treasure. There's several lifetimes of study and practice for you here."
5,works great,"Eat fast food on the fly, lots of ketchup drips on shirt/tie/jacket used this first time on recommendation from friend, works great been using for almost 10 years now"
5,Carbona Stain Devils,"I LOVE these products, have been purchasing them for several years. All the stains have disappeared using these products. Can't say enough about them. Buy, buy, buy all the varieties."
4,current thought,"Book offers current insight into current problems regarding the topics discussed. Some the more interesting to this reader were; Stereotopical topological morphism, or whether diffusion plays a more active (no pun intended) role than active transport based on the box dimension of cellular materials. In other words an infinite length string in a finite volume problem. Book also skiffs other areas of readers interest such as; are some kinetic rate equations a function of non-hyperbolic mathmetics, i.e. enzyme channeling. As with all the Nato series, these articles are only tibits of very interesting areas."
1,Is this for real?,"I would have expected a lot more from an Iranian writer. I feel that Americans in general have such a wrong view of Iran that we do not need books such as this to prove every negetive sterotype correct. Although I do belive that any of these events could have happened in the course of someone's life time, I really find it hard to belive that they could happen to someone in one single trip. It feels to me as if Nahid Rachlin knows what the American Press wants to hear, and writes exactly that. It helps her get published, but it certainly does not paint a true image of Iran."
5,nice instructional video,"This is a very nice dance instructional video. I'm aSalsa fanatic, thus I'm able to pick up the timingand the concepts in this video. My only comment orsuggestion is that this video should have spentmore time explaining the basic footwork by itselfas most salsa videos do (some people may find ithard to jump almost right into a close positionpush & pull.) They could also rehearse a little abouthow they address the audience.Other than that, this is a video I highly recommend."
2,flop,not what i thought it was.wont use itoverpricedout datedi wish people would advertise items in a correct manor
4,Good Instructional DVD,"I liked this dvd. The demonstrations from beginner to advanced were easy to follow. One thing that I think would have made this DVD better is when the instructors danced the summary of the steps they demonstrated, if they had of called out the steps before hand or during the dance, so that you could be prepared to follow along with them."
3,the guy looking for song that sounds like evanscence,"hey, i found the song you have been looking for it. the band is called Jem and the song is called 24. i hope this helped. im not really under 13 i just do this because i cant figure out how to write a review when i put im over 13 years old. so i figure this is the only way. i guess. if anyone can tell me how please let me know."
1,Song question,"Looking at the titles I'm assuming it's not on here, so I was wondering if anyone knew who did the song that was used in the commercials to promote the film? It sounds a little like Evanescence but I wasn't sure."
4,4 stars for the value!,"I was quite excited to order this Mario Batali serated knife as I have been impressed with some of the other celebrity chefs offerings (such as Wolfgang Puck which is excellent). However, I did get my hopes up a little too high and was expecting a knife that cuts like a professional bread and tomato knife. Although this knife does have a nice feel and looks beautiful, it is not the quality that a professional chef would use. I am accustomed to paying $30-$50 per knife for professional knives and this falls far short *as it should* being that is is under $10. If you do not have a good serated knife and you are not a professional chef, I think you will be very happy with this knife as it is very durable but do not expect a professional knife from Mario Batali at this point in time."
4,A lost and loved Fendi women's watch,"May it similar to a new Fendi women's watch my wife loved and just lost, alas-with a cloth or whatever strap- that we bought duty-free several years ago on a Delta international flight? And for which we paid about $300. at that time, I think?? Rated 3 or 4 starsThank you."
1,no song listings,Anybody would like to know what songs are in the cd or album before purchase. This would help sales. i find this info missing in most CD'S available for purchase.
1,"For ""C"" programmers only","Seems to be an excellent presentation but if you are not conversant in ""C"" programming language (I am not) best to forget it."
3,i havent seen it but the hip hop included makes me want to watch it...,"this seems like an old movie but i seen the hip hop song tracks provided in the other reviews and it makes me want to watch it! Ma Dukes by O.C. is right now my favorite song(along with 7 other songs from word...life) things done changed is classic from biggie, i used the beat from that rakim song to create a bigl/pac/biggie blend, atcq is a legendary group and so on.."
1,awful,"I got this for my husband and he thought the songs would be like the movie, but when we got this is, it was not!! Do not buy this CD. Watch the movie instead and get the songs you like at the end."
1,thank you rrichards253,"since i saw ""boiler room"" on cable about a year ago, i've been looking for what i thought was the vol. 2 hip-hop soundtrack, little did i know that it didn't exsist. i've gone to alot of stores and when i'm traveling back and forth to NYC i've stopped in at some of the major stores looking, asking the clerks about it, but they would always show me the original score. i'm sorry to say but the movie's score should have been all hip-hop because i don't remember any of the score garbage, no offense. so i'm taking this time to say thanks to richard for compliling the list, if not for you i'd still be looking for a soundtrack that doesn't exsist. thanks."
3,I WANTED THE SONGS!!!,"ok so i've been reading these reviews here and its great to know that the soundtrack with the actual songs doesn't even exist.i have looked high and low for it with no such luck.....this movie has some really good songs in it...why can't there be a cd with them?! if you like short tracks with no words, get the soundtrack, it won't disappoint you."
1,Here are the songs from the movie,"""New York (Ya Out There)"" by Rakim -- ""Keepin' The Faith"" by De La Soul -- ""Funky Child"" by ""Lords of the Underground"" -- ""Segue to Work"" by The Angel --""Sunset Eyes"" by Ernie Andrews ""Things Done Changed"" by Notorious B.I.G. -- ""Area"" by De La Soul -- ""Get On This"" by Ugly Duckling -- ""Ma Dukes"" by O.C. ""Award Tour"" by Tribe Called Quest -- ""Supa Star"" by Group Home ""Wait Gekko"" and ""I Just Know"" from Wall Street by Stewart Copeland -- ""Anywayz"" by Esthero -- ""Destiny Complete"" by The Angel -- ""You Don't"" by Tricky -- ""Right Here"" by Pharoahe Monch ""What a Thug About"" by Beannie Sigel -- ""That Ain't Gangsta"" by 50 Cents -- ""Brand Nubian Rock The Set"" by Brand Nubian ""Impress the Kid"" by Slick Rick -- ""Simon Says"" by Pharoahe Monch -- ""Money or Love"" by Saukrates"
2,A big let down. . .,"I went out and bought this CD today. The music is good and some of the best cutting edge hip hop, but it ends WAY too soon. The majority of the songs on here (if you can call them songs) are less then a minute long. Some are even a whole 17 sec long. This wouldn't be bad, but the music pauses in between each song, so it is disgustily obvious that the song is short. I think this would be a great CD if the songs were longer. You get into a song and then it just stops, then an new one starts, with the same bass cord as the last. A non-stop mix and this would be a great CD. Worth copying off the internet, not worth buying."
2,"Some decent hip-hop, but not what I was looking for...","I, too, expected to hear some of the great tunes from the movie, and was disappointed to find them conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. While the first twenty-four tracks are not entirely unenjoyable, those tracks are short, usually no more than a minute in length. Additionally, the two complete songs tacked on to the end are hardly the best tracks from the movie, and don't add much value. Couple this with the fact that the entire soundtrack is only 35 minutes long and it is clear that I did not get my money's worth with this one."
1,worst soundtrack ever,"this is by far the worst soundtrack i have ever heard. DO NOT BUY IT! i saw the movie and there were so many good songs in the movie. i thought that the soundtrack was going to be amazing. first of all, there are only two real songs on the entire cd. the other 23 or so tracks are about 1-2 minute musical background pieces that corespond to the different scenes in the movie. and about half of them sound the same. its a cd of background music. trust me. don't buy it."
3,Revolutionary Hip Hop Cut in Half,"I loved the movie and seeing the movie and the killer hip hop music put to it, I immediately went out and purchased the CD. This is some of the greatest hip hop in the world but the songs are cut too short. With almost each song being limited to under two minutes, the CD leaves you hangin' big time. It is great driving music simply because it gives your drive a chilled-to-the-bone soundtrack. I would [like]to find a CD by The Angel."
1,dont expect the songs from the movie,"i, like lots of other people, thought i would get the songs from the movie. they arent on it. dont get duped like i did."
2,Who Buys Sound Musical Sound Bytes?,"I was hoping to get the rap songs that are in the movie. You would think those would be on this CD, but what you really get is 24 tracks of the electronic music played in the background in the film plus 2 pretty good songs at the end. If possible, just buy the last two songs on this CD."
5,Absolutely stunning,"This is a no-brainer really. Frank Sinatra at the height of his considerable powers. Yet having purchased the CD I was still stunned by his singing. The control, phrasing and pitch are perfect. Never for Sinatra the frankly vulgar ways some modern recording artists attempt to wring emotion from every word.I'm a fan of Sinatra singing swing, preferably with the Count Basie Orchestra, but the orchestrations here are perfect for a set list of melancholy pieces. As previous reveiewers have said ""One for my Baby"" is the classic track, amongst an album full of classic tracks.I enjoy all sorts of music from Bach, Coltrane to Amy Winehouse, but regardless of genre this is an essential recording for any collection."
2,Save your money!,"I purchased this phone from SAM's Club - the one they sell is actually the 2489 which comes w/ an extra handset. The phones have great features, but the handsets are terrible. The sound quality comes and goes and sometimes when you try to turn the phone on it gives you a ""system busy"" message.The speakerphone quality is pretty good and feature-wise the phone is great. If you're looking for a good cordless phone, this is not it!"
4,Great unit but may not last long.,"This is a great unit if you have 2 lines at home or office. 2 separate voice mail boxes and good reception at longer distance than most. The intercom works great too to talk or fine a missing handset. You can purchase this base and handheld unit for less than the handheld unit alone (go figure). These units get considerably hot while charging, which must have caused one of my hand units to go bad internally after 2 years of use. Never-the-less, it is a great phone and I purchased a replacement so I can keep it for a few more years."
4,"I rate it "" Very Good""","Using this product with 2 handsets for about 3 years. This is not a ""Mercedez-Benz"" phone but certainly an acceptable, reliable product. One handset has developed a problematic dialing button, but you just press it a little harder (smile). Handsets work better if they have fairly fresh batteries. Range is good when battery is strong."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought the base unit and 2 added extensions. The instructions on the registration of the auxiliary phones omitted several steps. The base phone instructions don't even explain how to use call waiting, a pretty basic function popular since the 80's. Customer service leaves you on hold for 20 minutes, and they can't help you since they have never even seen the phone. They are just reading the same, truncated instructions you are! Maybe VTech should realize that the best advertising is word of mouth. Don't bother with this system."
1,Defective product and a rip-off to return,"This phone arrived defective - caller ID did not work at all, answering service was very hard to figure out, and half the time when the phone was hung up it did not ""recognize"" the base. After 30 min on the phone with VTECH they told us to call the seller.. who said they did not take returns after 15 days, charged a 15% re-stock fee and did not reimburse for shipping costs (6-8$ each way). Digital Etc. is vending rip-off defective items and forcing customers to bear most of the cost. Don't buy from them!"
2,Servicable Phone System,"I purchased the station as a replacement for the exact same station we had for four years or more. The number 2 button went bad on the existing handheld and this was the least expensive way to replace it. This is a servicable and inexpensive 2-line system. The voice quality isn't all that good. The buttons on the handhelds are too small, somewhat confusing and hard to press -- but it's generally OK. For those reasons, I wouldn't choose it for families with older people or youngsters. The newer models are probably better. I wouldn't have bought it except as a replacement."
2,Poor quality answering machine,"I would not recommend this product. I am returning it, because the quality of the answering machine is very poor. The playback sounds like a robots voice instead of a crisp digital quality recording. I am also not impressed with the sound quality of the handset, but I would have kept it but for the terrible answering machine quality."
1,Not an option for a business,"Got this one to replace the 2 US-made Siemens Gigasets 2400 / 2420 where all the handsets died = ended up sounding like you are under water. Good at first, except a few flaws like unable to transfer the numbers programmed into a handset to another one...Who likes programming each phone, when you use several.However, after a few months callers complain about the crackling in the line. Checked, it is the V-Tech's !Cannot suggest buying this one,despite it's reasonable price. Only problem if you want a 2-line: what else is there? Ugly Panasonic...and then ?"
1,Worst value in 30 years of purchasing phones,"Don't buy this product. Most of the time when people call and we are not home, the answering machine hangs up on them. When I call or write technical support, they tell me to unplug the phone and plug it back in. I am not going to do this every day. We have had this system in our home for 18 months and I regret the day I purchased it. It has been nothing but trouble. Also, the headsets, which are not cheap, fall apart and Vtech refuses to address the problem. Granted the product is out of warranty, but this is a recurring issue, and clearly is a problem with product quality. I get better service out of a $30 phone I bought 15 years ago than on this over $300 investment."
1,Weak Signal,"This system used to work fine for the last couple of years I've owned it, but for the last 6 months it seems that the interference in the 2.4 ghz band from wireless computer networks has been too much for it. It no longer offers a clear reliable signal past a few feet from the base.My Siemens system still offers a good signal through two floors of the house on 2.4 ghz, however, I may have to replace both systems with a 5.8 Ghz in any case."
1,Worse Quality than 1st Gen Cordless,Absolutely horrible quality. I have another 900 Mghz that is 10 times better in terms of range and sound quality. The answering machine is frequently unintelligible. These are priced at the low end of the spectrum but are not worth it. I'm going to try and find a cost effective alternative or else fork out $200+ for a top of the line system.
2,BAKERS SECRET PANS,I HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT BAKERS SECRET PAN AND I CLEAM THEM IN THE DISH WASHER.THE DISHER WASHER MUST HAS TAKES THE NON-STICK COATING OFF THEM AND THEY ARE ALL RUSTING NOW.
2,Get what you pay for....,"I bought this phone because I wanted a cordless phone with an answering machine (all 1 unit) for my kitchen, but I didn't want to spend very much. Well, with the answering machine, it is very difficult to understand the messages. I have to listen to them from the handset. And the clarity in the handset is awful! Not only is there an echo of my own voice in the earpiece, but it picks up every little sound from the room and amplifies it. It is also very difficult to hear the person on the other end. But what should I have expected from a $13 phone. (Of course it was $30 when I bought it.) I should have just waited and spent the extra money on a better phone as now I am on the search for a new better quality phone."
2,"It's a fine phone, if you don't need your messages.","This is a typical, low-cost phone, and it works about how you'd expect. The signal doesn't carry strongly through 4 walls -- whatever.The main problem is the ease with which you can erase the message you're about to listen to, when you mean to be erasing the one you've just heard."
2,headset option does not work,the headset plug thing does not work. i ended up buying two new headsets before figuring this out. very diapointing. it just colelcts dust now.
4,Thrilling and Sound,"Unfolding like a novel, this book was written by a renowned biologist spearheading the first major scientific surveys of the Loch Ness phenomena. His approach could hardly be more thorough or scientifically sound. Taking in all the data, Mackal deduces the most probable species of the monster. Highly recommended for science-minded people who savor life's mysteries."
3,Not what I expected,"This is not what I had expected. I thought I was receiving a performance video, this was a biography, sort of, about Yasmina Ramzy and her dance school in Toronto. I would have liked to see more performances, instead of little snippets, or more on her class techniques than was included. If you are thinking of taking classes from her, I recommend watching this dvd first, otherwise I would skip it and try to find some performance dvds of her and her ensemble."
4,Nice introduction through stored procedures,"There is a nice introduction in this book that sets up the basics of .NET access right in the first chapter. It then drills into ADO.NET, commands and finally into readers. There are a few chapters on Windows Forms and ASP.NET before the author gets into stored procedures. These could probably have been dropped, but they don't distract too much. The section on stored procedures is a little scanty.Definitely a good book for someone just starting with database access in .NET who wants a step-by-step walkthrough. There is a small section on database fundamentals, but I wouldn't look to the book to teach you that. Best to get a book on database basics if you don't understand the fundamentals."
5,Great Basic Kit,This was given to my 9 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. My husband has tied a couple flies along with my 11 year old. It's a great starter kit.
4,wher my hustlas at?,"This is a bounce cd the came out in the early 90's and was a hit with because of the song where my hutlas at? The rest of the cd isntt to bad.He has a flow which is a singing and rapping style that sounds like nelly. ""were my huslas at?""s the only reason i brought the cd. That song is super crunk. Down load it off the internet or somthing. You have to hear it. Also the cd is about 7 or 8 songs, it could of been longer and some of the songs sound a lil dated now."
4,Not that dark.,"I was hoping for something realy amazing and dark, but its still not a bad buy. I'd say there's only about 3 standout tracks on this cd.If your looking for something truly sinister and dark, check out Response by Ashley Casselle and Synesthesia by Taylor.Both very dark but with good taste rythem and flavor."
1,"No, not so great","To compare this to a Digweed, Sasha, or Nick Warren mix would be very misleading. With a few exceptions (Sugarglider, Mara), this is a very generic, flavorless trance mix. It is *not* complex. There is no groove, no soul, no build - in short, very little to keep your interest going. It's not the trance that you'll find on Digweed-Hong Kong or Anthony Pappa - Nu Breed. If you're expecting something of that quality, don't buy this. I was very disappointed in this mix, although it did give me new appreciation for the kind of mixes created by quality DJs (not Fortier)."
1,"Prose is sparse, so is the action and character development.",Lifeless and purposefully opaque. So much distance is put between the characters and their empty lives and the reader that ultimately there is no emotional connection with the reader. I admire David Mamet so much as a playwright and movie director that I slogged through 121 pages before I gave up completely. I'm bugged by critics who admire crap like this. Just because it was written by a genius doesn't mean the book is genius. It's a failure on a genius scale.
2,Mind-numbingly dull.,"The Village by David Mamet is a disjointed compendeum of slice of life scenarios. In it the inner lives of a number of taciturn, stoic New Englanders are revealed through detailed introspection and minimalist dialogue. The characters themselves are presented as ghost-like beings, full of inwardly directed thought but with little else to flesh out their personas. This book is unsatisfying and pretentious. Not recommended."
1,Dreadful,Just attempting to listen to this massively dreadful excuse for music makes my head hurt. Since I am equipped with two working ears and human hearing I am amazed that anyone could sit through it.
5,Great Little Iron,This is a great little iron. Very lightweight but irons like a pro. Heats and reheats quickly. The shot of steam function is powerful and I love not having to mess with a cord. I use this iron both for clothing and when quilting. Highly recommended.
3,Overall- good,"Overall, pretty good product. I design and make bags and I think this product would be great for a hobbyist, not a professional. However, I do like that it has a carry base and cover. I like that it is light weight, even full of water. I like the detachable water container.I don't like that it loses heat fairly quickly and needs to be constantly put back on the base. Even fresh from the base, it does not give off a lot of steam. It *DOES NOT* have a water spray feature, which I was really unhappy about. To solve the problem, I got a spray bottle at Ikea.Overall, good, solid product. Perhaps it will grow on me, and I will just learn more about it. In all, I like it and would probably buy it again."
3,Not a Rowenta!,"After my Rowenta finally bit the dust the 18th time I dropped it, I thought I'd try a cordless and was really looking forward to that feature. Unfortunately it doesn't stay hot long enough to be truly useful. I can iron about 1/3 of a shirt before I have to stick it back on the charger, which is pretty annoying. Back to Rowenta for me..."
5,Love this iron!,I am a sewer and a quilter and use this iron almost daily. We have had it over 2 years. My husband uses it regularly for his shirts. It is light-weight and easy to use. I have taken it to sewing classes conviently because of the easy carrying case. You only need to put it back on the base while you are re-positioning your fabric/clothing and it keeps hot. Not having to wrestle with a cord all the time is well worth the second it takes to put it in the base.
2,Not as it seems.,"Sorry Jazwarez, but this protoman really sucked.The overall figure was shaped well, but the ""Missile"" that it comes with doesn't go into the blaster, as there is no button to shoot it with. You have to pose him like the picture just to get his missile to stay in there.The Shield, which is by far is signature ""Weapon"", can't fit on him at all, it didn't have anything on the shield to grab on to with mine. It had a hole and thats about it. I tried everything to get him to hold it and finally had to use Super Glue.Sorry Jaz. If this is a Machine error, I would like another if not, please customers think before you buy."
4,matchbox twenty is awesome!,"This single is good, but I'd recommend getting the entire ""mad season"" cd. It's definitely worth it! :) Of course, if you're a huge matchbox twenty fan like I am, you'll want this single in addition to the cd!"
5,Matchbox Twenty,Its great that they released this as a single! It is worth paying for even if you have the entire cd already for the wonderful live track that is included. Pick it up today!
4,Buy it for Push!,"Bent is a cool song, I admit. I really like it. But I bought this single because I heard the unplugged version on Push on the radio. This version is worth buying the single alone. It is a stripped down, slowed down version, with horns in the background. Any MB20 fan will have to have this song. Plus, you get Bent. What a deal"
2,I love these,"I really like these.However, they arrived and every single can had the candies melted together in a big mess.These probably were left outside in the desert ... they certainly were not sent protected in any way."
2,Bad Content Organization,"The contents of the book are bad organized.In the Book's Preface it is stated that the book is for Beginners. Besides the disorganized contents, when I was looking for some additional information, I tried to look up some relevant contents, but the information were not there."
1,Horrible,I bought these for my 11 year old daughter. She hated them. She told me they were itchy and uncomfortable. She was constantly complaining. And they looked very tight and just....odd. I do not suggest this product for you.
4,Covers many different topics,"This book is comprised of several article that cover many issues of Violence Against Women. This book is a good resource when you are trying prepare a report or presentation on violence against women. This book is not for recovery, but is designed for education on the subject.The writting is clear and concise. She puts together many compelling studies on the subject of violence against women. The book is filled with statistics that give a very compelling argument that violence against women is a crime against not only the individual and society itself."
5,Excellent Video For the B-36 Enthusiast,"Length:: 2:21 MinsThis video is the real thing. It shows you what it was like to be a member of a crew that flew the B-36. It has excellent newsreel footage, as well as scenes of the crew preparing for a mission. You get to see this aircraft from every angle. Some of this video has narration and some of it has music with captions."
1,Doesn't look anything like the character.,This item does not look this good in real life. I was very disappointed with this product's appearance. Don't buy.
4,The most concise and coherent spirit book I've seen...,"The New York Bartender's Guide is the simplest of its type. I've been using the Mr. Boston book for years now, and find that the 'NY' does just as well, if not better because it is more up to date, and allows for easier referencing. I recommend this book highly if you are the type who likes to try new things!"
3,Too small of a handle,I normally think highly of Victorinox cutlery but the handle on this knife is too small for a person that has large thick hands.
4,Good for the Price,"This knife is very sharp from the factory, unlike many of the American made ones that need some honing. I don't care much for the puny handle (I like more meaty handles, even on parers). But it is fine for most smaller jobs. The thin blade is very good for delicate jobs. For this price I just buy a new one every year or so when the blade becomes full of nicks."
4,Great workout!,"Another great Step dvd by Gin Miller. If you are new to stepping, I recommend you follow her other DVD Everybody Steps first. Once you are comfortable with the steps, then this one is a great for a cardio workout, and it's a workout! I can't get through the whole DVD yet, but I'm working on it. I switch back and forth with this DVD and Everybody Steps. My condition is improving!"
5,Great Step Workout,"I bought this DVD when my favorite basic step DVD quit working. This is my NEW favorite. I've done step aerobics off and on for about 10 years. This is a challenging workout without being too ""dance-y"". Ms. Miller's cues are great, and her personality is not annoying or chirpy at all. Great workout."
3,Drags on...and on...,"This is supposed to be a back to basics video. And it is. But it's too basic! I found myself checking my watch almost every minute hoping I was closer to being done. The steps are simple and have many, many reps. It would be nice if it started like this and then sped up, but it's the same thing the whole time. It never mixed things up more quickly or did anything to keep me interested. I think this is for beginners with a lot of stamina who don't need more fancy choreography to keep them from getting bored out of their minds. It's a good workout and will keep your heartrate up if you don't give up out of boredom."
2,My mistake,"I thought that since it was named ""Simply Step: Classic Moves"" that it would be aimed at beginners as well as old timers. I am just beginning to work with a step and this DVD was way over my head and my heart. I am now looking for someone to give it to."
2,simple stepping,"This has very simple stepping moves but still a good workout. She isnt annoying but I wouldnt call it fun and dancy- more of a basic aerobic workout without the dance choreography. I think the dancing makes step fun so this isnt really for me, a bit too boring... but if you want something where you dont have to think- and still get a good workout with an instructor who delivers clear cues and is not annoying in any way (at least I dont think so)- then this is for you!"
3,For Beginners,"I had only been doing step for a couple of months when I bought this. I do a step class 2x weekly and used this as my 3rd at home step workout. Although I really liked it at first, I have gotten tired of it after 5 months of using it. To combat the lame music, I Mute her and put on step music CD's to pep things up a bit. Her steps are simple and great for beginners but she does too many reps of each steps as she explains everything with too much detail. The length of the workout is good but I'm ready to move on now to something more intense."
2,too boring and simple,"I love step and have been doing it for over 5 years in group class. After I moved to another city, I started to do step at home therefore bought this dvd. The reviews seem good, so I chose it, but I honestly don't like this dvd after I used it. The movements are very boring and tedious, and the music is horrible (don't have good strong bits, and couldn't cheer me up at all). The timing of her commands is fine, but she talked too much especially after I've tried once. I couldn't wait to finish every time I practice with this dvd, other than enjoying doing it."
1,simply step: classic moves,"This dvd was damaged, and would not play...even though it was brand new. I exchanged it for another and it was damaged and would not play either. I returned it and I'm still not sure if Amazon credited my account properly...I spent more time on the phone w/ Amazon and at the post office than I would have doing the exercise tape. Will never order another dvd from Amazon again.* Also ordered a ""new"" copy of a Gin Miller video described in perfect condition from an individual listing/selling through Amazon, and that tape was defective as well. I got a more prompt refund from her than from Amazon."
4,Great workout on all counts,"I have taught fitness classes for over 20 years. I love to be a student on my days off and Gin Miller is the ultimate teacher. Her attitude and personality make this workout fun. Her moves are well cued and you are going to be sweating before you know it. I love being given a challenge and Gin does that. If you are a beginner you can do a little at a time, or just stay on the floor until you feel ready to go back to the step. She is the master of step and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great step workout!"
3,It's a good workout but very basic,"But Gin Miller, to me, is incredibly annoying! She makes all these weird noises that I think are supposed to be cute but I just can't get around it! I did this workout a couple of times and have never done it again. Her Reebok workout was a good one if you like plyometrics and she wasn't half as irritating. I should have gone to collagevideo.com to watch a 30 second clip before I bought it like I usually do and I never would have purchased this video."
3,Very simple step routine,"This step DVD is very easy. So if you're looking for a medium to advanced step routine...this is NOT it. It's O.K., but for someone who has been doing step for 25 years, I found it very boring. Basic steps and nothing more."
3,okay,"This is nothing like the Reebok videos. It's not very upbeat. I was so disappointed. The workout is too easy, I was expecting something much tougher. Probably good for beginners. Gin is the only person on the video. It's a strange set up. It's nothing all all like the Reebok VHS tapes of old. I much preferred those to be honest."
5,"For beginners, yet challenging","I've done this workout about 5 times now. When I started doing it, I was a total novice to stepping and was discouraged by how challenging it is.I'm glad I didn't give up. This DVD made me realize how out of shape I am; this morning, I was finally able to do it all the way through. It is not easy but definitely gives you a great cardio workout.I'm an avid home DVD workout person and have to say that Gin Miller is so unique from other instructors in that she has a great personality (no whooping and hollering here) and is very good at cuing you to the next move. Very important to someone uncoordinated, like me!"
3,"Great Pictures, but several mistakes","I recently purchased this book and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It provides good history and great pictures, but in the technical data, there are tons of mistakes in the conversion from the metric system to the imperial system. For example in comparing the range between two aircraft, one aircraft has a longer range than the other when looking at the range in kilometers, but it is the other way around when looking at miles. The other complaint is that the book leaves out several aircraft which have been around for a while when this book was published, for example the 777 and A340."
4,Durable fun toy,My daughter (5) is very into unicorns right now. This one is durable for her to play with. Also it's a good size.
2,spy science toy,"Excuse me, this is being sold as a toy? It is PURE JUNK. Most of the toys out there are pretty bad but this one passes over. AWFUL!!!"
4,Very well done,"I read the book in Both languages, Mr Severgnini is an oustanding writer, fresh concise and to the point. I don't agree with many things he wrote but then he has not lived in this country for half a century as I did. Hopefully he will revisit our nation and stay longer to discover the flavor of an America that few tourists ever see and learn about it. Best wishes to Mr. Severgnini"
2,Disappointed,"An article in the Washington Post raised my interest in this book. When I finally received and read my ""translated into English"" copy, I was disappointed. I think my hopes were a little high, hearing about how ""funny"" the book is - perhaps like some of Bill Bryson's books. The book is poorly edited, and I believe that a lot of what may be enjoyable in the Italian language version is lost in the translation. For Italians(and others) interested in America, the Italian language version might be a very good choice. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book."
4,Never been to Florida,"I sailed into RWW a little over a year ago and have since been hooked. Eventhough this is a fin over the top, I found myself drowning with delight in Tomlinson. Tommy-san has become essential to this series, like lime in that Cuba Libre.""Pain is an inescapable part of human experience. misery is an option"". Where do I get a copy of ONE FATHOM ABOVE SEA LEVEL?"
4,Fast paced thriller,This is another fast paced thriller in the Doc Ford series It has the usual cast of characters and a few new friends and the outlandishly weird crooks and thugs. Lots of florida lore about the indians and the everglades. Lots of surprizes.
3,OK video,I had expected something more educational. It is OK for a horse owner to help them understand what horse shoeing is about but not much education for a student or professional farrier.Maybe if I watch it a second time I will find more depth than I did on the first viewing.
5,Dope,"If you like Gangsta Pat, Lil Tec or any Memphis/ ATL Rap you gonna like this cd. Its a must for any dirty south rap fan"
1,BUYER BEWARE -- SAME SONGS -- DIFFERENT SOUND,"THESE SONGS HAVE BEEN ALTERED. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SONGS WHICH WERE THEIR HITS. THEY USE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS, SUNG DIFFERENTLY AND MANY OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE AS WELL.THEY DO NOT SOUND ANYTHING LIKE THEIR ORIGINAL HIT RECORDINGS OF YEARS BACK. THEY STINK."
3,Simply O.K.,"Although I enjoyed very much the style with which this short little book focused on Philippians 3 was written, I was a little disappointed with the content. Surprisingly engaging on the front end, but as I went through the book, not so much. The premise of finding a depth in our relationship with Christ is very alluring, but I didn't feel like the content delivered on the promised outcome. At only 62 pages, it doesn't take long to read and so it is still worth the time. Perhaps others will find it more helpful than I did.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
5,Fantastic,"After seeing Dr. Stowell at a conference, I was excited to get this book. If you are a Christian, just getting by ... read this book! It will challenge you, and make you re-think about your walk with Jesus. It is top notch, and lists many verses to study in the bible.Get it, read it, and get closer to Christ!"
4,Fun game,"I enjoyed this game where I was a character locked in a dungeon, had to find my way out and then around castle Shadowgate to finally meet up with the main bad guy. This is not a slash around killing game, it is a puzzle and thinking game. You walk around picking up things, talking to people, doing things a certain way to see what happens. You can get killed in this game, so be sure to save often, your last save point is where you will start again if you are killed. You need a memory card to save with this game! I did get stuck in the game several times, at least 3 times and had to write to Nintendo to find out how to proceed! But with their help I made it to the very end. This game is appropriate for children that can read, as you must read to play the game, and there is no goulish violence."
4,A great puzzle!,"As a female gamer, I get sick of the combat games. I liked the fact that this game, for a change, had no combat. It's one big puzzle where you pick up everything you can along the way and then figure out where to use your items. It's VERY challenging. My sister and I got stuck once in a while because there was an item we missed, but you can go back through the towers you have unlocked to get anything you overlooked. My brother quickly got frustrated and quit, but my sister and I stayed up all night and finished the game. I loved it and hope they make more like it! If you're looking for combat, you won't like it. But if you like puzzles, this game is one big puzzle filled with smaller ones! Finally, a game that is all about using your brain and all your creativity to solve it!"
4,BAM!,"Had lots of jam time going thru this, but I had online help to get thru some parts. I got this as a rental to check it out. With walkthru, still took me 7 hrs. in 2 days to get thru to the end. Found myself getting turned the wrong way in some sections. Cool graphics. I'll pick this one up and try without the walkthru."
4,The Story of Ethics,The book was a challenge but was a great help in understanding the reasoning od philosopher through the ages. The book I recieved was in bad shape inside and out. In some places the highlighting was hard to read.
3,COLA requirement,"This book was for a required class that I otherwise would have avoided. Overall, it's not a bad book. I would have preferred a better subject index guide. Considering the subject, the authors did a good job. CHD"
5,Gorgeous and stunning,"I saw Raquel Bitton at Carnegie Hall 2 weeks ago,It was the best concert ever. She is so great! My 20 year old daughter cried and laughed and had the best time and we bought the CD. We love it! One of your guest reviewers spelled Piaf wrong,it's with one F not 2 and he says that the songs were murdered with English translations. Is he out of his mind? I own a Piaf recording where Piaf sings ""I shouldn't care"" in English,Raquel does a much better job. Also ""I shouldn't care"" and ""J'm'en fous pas mal"" are the same song,same melody,the orchestrations are so great that it seems like a different song,but it is not.Raquel Bitton you are one of a kind. We can't hardly wait for the next CD."
5,Moving performance of Edith Piaf,"I have been very much enjoying Raquel Bitton's singing of Edith Piaf. It is very moving...really capturing Piaf and in turn captures the soul of France. It is melodious, a good variation in tone with great depth. The range of emotions are remarkable..from C'est l'amour to Mon Dieu. Ms. Bitton's personality really shines in Enfin le Printemps. The backup music, especially the brass enhances the mood. I continue to really enjoy this collection..it is a CD which has great longevity."
3,She should stick with her own style.,"These recordings are not well produced and sound like someone dusted off some old LPS and put them onto CD. The artist, herself, is fine (although she is no Edith Piaf!) and does a passing ""imitation"" of her idol, though without the heart and soul that made a legend.Makes a good case for finding one's own signature style rather than trying to mimic someone else's...particularly someone as inimitable as Piaf."
1,"Bitton does Piaf--in English, malheureusement!","Do not be mislead regarding this CD. While I cannot find technical fault with the artist, the CD is a mishmash of English and French which ruins this collection! I have no idea why the prodcuers felt the French songs had to be badly translated into English. To say that, for example, ""J m'en fou pas mal"" can be rendered as ""I shouldn't care"" is doing a grave injustice to the original. This and similar CD's need to carry warning labels that the original work has been altered. Ms. Bitton should have stuck to French."
2,To Answer Reviewer Robert C.,I wouldn't boast of orchestration on this CD. Perhaps you need to begin reviewing cookbooks also!
5,If you love Patrica Hodgell and David Gemmell then read this,"Do your like Dark Heroic Fantasy where the enemy is implacable, insidious and not constrained by human moral concerns. Where ancient beings of great power wage unending war. Where the humans are completely aware of what will happen to them and all they hold dear if they fail to stand firm and to hold the line. This the world of Paul Edwinn Zimmer. The world of 'The Dark Border'. The writing is tight,fluid and descrpitve. The action fast paced. In this world you know who your enemies are, the problem is knowing who your are friends. So come brave reader journey with Istvan Divega as he tries to honour an oath he made long ago and now deeply regrets. Where honour, daring and bravery still hold true."
4,Heats up great!,"I really like this works great, it heats up fast and makes perfect waves and its very easy to use."
2,not what i was thinking,"I had been searching several different ones. these waves are small...i was wanting deeper waves...but it didn't say anything about deep waves for this product so that's my fault. so, very small waves almost crimp look...and i can't run my fingers through my hair because it becomes one big fluff. Maybe spray would be better...but i don't like to put chemicals in my hair...so i have not tryed that."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have thick hair and I spend lots of time putting it in braids to have a wave effect. No longer, 20 minutes with this iron and my hair is wavy and not frizzy."
3,20's look attempt with this curling iron,"This iron works good, very hot, the barrels aren't as big as I hoped but did a good job helping me try to get the 20's hair wave look."
2,No good,Did not work for me at all. I have short hair and I really think it depends on the texture of your hair BC it just frizzed mine up.
5,allotta bang for a little buck,This cheap price does not indicate cheap quality --- There are many crimp/waiver irons out there that are much more money than this one -- but this one is awesome --- the barrel size it perfect --- not too small to make your hair look frizzy --- just perfect -- with three barrels it takes no time to do your whole head -- I leave some straighter pieces underneath and this creates a very nice contrast -- I usually don't take the time to write a review but I just wanted people to know --- great buy --- I would buy it as a gift for others
1,Don't buy from this seller!!,"They don't respond, I have been trying to return this item and they won't get back to you!"
3,It 's really 2.5 stars,"Okay, This book dragged on for about 100 pages too long for me. I kept putting it down, and then I ended up reading 2 other books in between. It seemed to take FOREVER for Brant and Samille to come together. It was between not liking it and just okay. I know Maureen is a good writer, but for me this wasn't one of the good ones."
4,A First for Me,I'm not necessarily a fan of Romantic Suspense but it's a first for everything. I really enjoy the book. It was rather lenghty but went into great detail. I would definitely read another book in this genre. It did take me a while to get into the book but overall it was a great read.
4,Great read.,This was a really good read. I really enjoy Maureen Smith's work. She writes interesting stories. This story was really touching.
1,Non molto bene,"The author spends one entire side of one tape telling the student his life history. He then repeats all the English words at least twice. This is most annoying. English speakers know ""go"" and ""can"" upon hearing the words the frist time.As the lesson progresses he does not expalin the transfer from the present to the past or the future. He tells you the lesson is on page 13 when it is actually on 15. Highly over rated. Not worth the price.."
3,"Oh, no, not Dein ist mein ganzes herz plus English version","Why must record companies endlessly churn out the same familiar stuff, when Tauber recorded many hundreds of songs and operatic items?And, as another reviewer has justly indicated, at least make the CD contents audible. It's just too irritating to have to keep altering the volume because some engineer didn't bother to get the level right in the first place.Isn't it possible for recording companies to set a common standard of volume level, particularly when the originals were recorded in a constricted dynamic?Okay, apart from the rant, Tauber still sounds fine, but some less stale material would be nice. How about next time including some of his radio and stage recordings, such as excerpts from his final Covent Garden performance as Don Ottavio?"
1,these ain't it,"For years now,I've been trying to replace a pair of my favorite sandals.These ain't it.Thin soles,Not much support.And a real ugly toe."
4,Timberland Trailray Sandals,These are the best! They are the most comfortable sandals I have worn - and they look great too. My only point of issue is that not long after I purchased the sandals the price was dropped 20%. That's a bummer.http://www.amazon.com/Timberland-Mens-Trailray-Sandal-Brown/dp/B000YDYY5K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1248918036&sr;=8-1
1,Wrong title,"This DVD is not an ""Introduction to Krav Maga"". The title ought to be The History or The Origin of Krav Maga. The DVD is useless."
3,Pretty Good! Norman Hutchins back in the day!,"I really just wanted this cd because it gave me a chance to hear something old from Norman Hutchins. It sounds pretty good, and I am glad to make it a part of my collection."
5,BEWARE!,"There are two different cd's floating around with this title. There is the classic K-tel release (pictured here) and some recent release (also by K-tel!) with the same title. The newer version contains 10 tracks (no...it's not even an edited verion of the classic). Hold out for the one with the green cover. It's hard to find, but well worth the effort."
2,Little charger for little use,"After only 10 months, I have charged two sets of 4 batts Duracell 2650mAh for my camera Canon SX10 IS. I can't use my camera more than 15 minutes. Hum!While I used these batts in a portable CD player, I can listen up to 5 CDs. Is it good?I read the review from Chris Rioux on Amazon about this charger and I understood a lot of things. If you want to use this charger for a digital camera, get ready to buy another one in few months.So, I have to search for a new hard NiMH working charger and batts (2500mAh nad more)."
4,Nice,"I'm pleased with the performance of this product! My only complaint is that the unit needs a ""brick"" transformer to plug into the wall which is rather large. Batteries seem to last and so far no problems."
1,Doesn't work,"It never charged the batteries very well. It came with a set of Duracell batteries, and I bought an extra set and used them for a camera's flash unit. I had to keep pumping up the exposure and having to wait longer between shots. The batteries just never charged fully.Sometimes the charger would run for hours, sometimes for 15 minutes. Either way, the batteries never charged very much. I finally put the batteries in an old (Energizer) charger, which takes 8-12 hours, but at least it provides a good charge."
1,Fully Charged Batteries Die Quickly!!,I have Sanyo Eneloop batteries and recharger at home and it's fantastic - I recharge and forget about them for months. This Duracell charger is crap!
1,The death of a thousand batteries,This charger is a battery killer. By forcing a charge that fast the anode is swelling too fast. Duracell just wants you to ruin your rechargeable batteries and then have to replace them often.
4,Duracell 15 Min. NiMh charger,"the charger works perfect and well worth the price, however it is too bulky for travel."
2,disappointed,"We bought this set and it worked alright in the beginning, yet even then it didn't last as long as it stated it would. After 3-4 chargings the batteries seemed to just die after 1-2 day of light usage in a digital camera. I went out and bought a pack of 4 new duracell rechargeable batteries and had the same result. I compared the longevity to a regular Energizer battery and it out performed this battery 3 to 1."
4,Great Bracket for my Lexus IS,"Great Bracket works great. it comes with the holder also. It could be sturdier than just regular plastic. Nevertheless, it works."
4,Pet lovers will be touched by this story,"I remembered reading about this brave mother cat some time ago, and never did find out what had happened to her and her kittens. This book covers the REST of her story. It was good to find out that her tragic story ended well, and that she and her kittens lived happy lives with loving owners.It not only told about her bravery, but in the goodness of so many people who wanted to give her, and her kittens good homes.It reminded me that there ARE still many people who are willing to share their love and concern with others- human or furry."
2,too plastic,"This bracelet is much more plastic than it looks in the photo. It's okay, but absolutely not worth the $22 I paid for it. You can get something like this for ten times less in Walmart."
3,Not enough to pass on its own,Do not use this book as your only resource when studying for your exam. This is a great book for people have access to the software and 2 machines and no clue about windows 2k (LIKE ME) they will give you a basic understanding of administrative tasksAfter reading this book then an MS Press book and a couple of online practice tests to measureup my skills and make sure I had the examessentials to pass I was able to pass the test.
3,Could have been better,"Like most people, I purchased this book as a study aid for passing the Microsoft exam. I have to say I was disappointed. The book did serve as a good starting place, but once reviewed and compared against other exam prep materials (and then finally the Microsoft Exam itself), the book failed to be a decent reference point for study. The very basic material was covered decently, but the more complex material (that the test is actually based on) was either not covered, or covered so quickly that you would never have gotten the answers from this book. I've used other Sybex books in the past, and this one falls short of their norm."
1,Clarification,"As the title states, this was an attempt to locate extant specimens of plants collected by C.S. Rafinesque by means of his correspondence with other botanists of his time. Copies of its 18 pages of typed text reproduced by Xerox were sent to institutions known to have herbaria that might also have harbored letters and other manuscripts written by Rafinesque's correspondents. Some institutions, both in the United States and Europe, chose to enter the title in the catalogs of their libraries."
5,NEW TWIST ON ROYALTY!,"This is one of the funniest books on European Royalty I've read in a long time. As a student of history, I have heard of most of the royal mistresses mentioned but this was a great new way of telling the stories. It was almost like reading a girls gossip ring on paper and I couldn't put it down. I couldn't believe some of the things these men and women got away with!All in all a GREAT book! A must have for anyone interested in history or royalty."
2,"""Sex with the Queen"" is Better...","I was rather disappointed in this book. It was not well organized at all. Too much time is given to the same kings (Louis XIV and Charles II) and mistresses and the book jumps all over the place in general, which is a major distraction. I can't believe she spent so little time on Edward VII, arguably one of the most randy kings in history. The barest mention is made of any king prior to Charles II. And there is hardly any mention of Russian Czars and their mistresses. Her follow-up book, ""Sex with the Queen"", is MUCH better. She put that book in chronological order, which I think would have served this material much better. It would indeed have been interesting to see the development of the mistress' powers throughout the centuries. This book is OK, but not the page-turner it could have been. Do yourself a favor and buy ""Sex with the Queen"" instead."
5,My Favorite Book This Summer!,"As a student of history, I thought I knew everything there is to know about the personal lives of European royalty. Eleanor Herman is obviously a researcher and historian of great talents, because I learned more about the great royal courtesans from her book than I had discovered from any other single source. And here is the really great thing about this book: it's wildly entertaining! I wish more historians had such a sense of humor about their subjects--we'd all be more educated about the past. The author treats her subjects with great dignity and respect, yet never forgets that the mistresses were, at their core, entertainers themselves. This is a stylish and comprehensive romp through the bedrooms of kings that I enjoyed immensely and will recommend to everyone I know. SEX WITH KINGS is a breath of fresh air that blows the dust off of history shelves. BRAVA!"
3,Let's get organized.,"I found the subject matter very interesting, but it was way too repetitive. I wish the author would have organized the material in more of a chronological order. I would have loved to read the entire story of one mistress, one at a time. Reading 20+ references of Madame Pompadour made it difficult to get a cohesive picture of her life with the king.I recommend the book, but be prepared to be frustrated with the read."
2,Don't waste your money - a racy title and not much else...,"The construction of the book is quite poor. It jumps around too much by having too many people in a topic, with those people reappear again and again in different topics. The first few chapters were especially confusing as I had a difficult time trying to remember who is whose mistress. The author might have done better to devote one chapter for each mistress and detailing her story. Afterall, her focus seems to be on, first, the Versailles court (especially Louis 14 and 15), and then the English court. Material on other countries appear to be fillers for each chapter.I was already losing interest halfway through the book. Much of the information is too repetitive. It would probably be more interesting to read a book on the French kings, the Versailles court, or even the mistresses themselves."
1,Gratuitous Sex scene,This book was dumb. I can tell that alot of research went into it but did it really need to be written? I felt like it was a continuous gratuitous sex scene written to get a rise out of people. Discussed at a book club and not a favorite
4,interesting light read,"This is an interesting light read about some of the most infamous mistresses in history. From Madame de Montespan's witchery to Lady Castlemaine's historic control over Charles II. The author covers the how and why of how of these ladies came into the King's world, held their positions, fought for pensions, outwitted rivals and queens, birthed bastards and how after their meal tickets either moved on or passed away leaving these ladies to fight their enemies. She doesn't go deep, so if you aren't familiar with a mistress, you will want to research farther. I liked how the author wrapped this up with the current Royals and showed how much has and hasn't changed."
1,Poorly laid out!,Very disappointing! I bought this book to be a juicy companion to a much-needed vacation and was so bored (endless repetition and poor organization of material...) that I purposefully left the book on the plane. My vacation was much better without this snoozer.
2,Potential is there....just needs more work,"This book has lots of tid bits of relationships between the kings and their mistresses. The information seems to be well recorded but the composition of the book is more than I could take. There were times that I was clueless as to whom she was speaking of because the wording jumps around from one person to another and is not clear. That made it hard for me to follow. There are endless notes and reference information that can get annoying after some time. All in all the information that is presented is interesting. It is just the way it is presented that I had trouble with. Keep writing, I believe you may have better luck next time."
2,Rex Sex,"If you are looking for salacious, sexy history, don't bother to read ""Sex with Kings."" The title is the best thing about the book. Although the author examines the lives and times of royal mistresses from the 15th century to the present, she does not inbue her history with any raciness or sense of the personalities involved at all. This is just rather routine recitations of the perks and pains of being a maitresse en titre. The book is organized by topic rather than chronologically, which makes for confusion and a rather choppy read. All in all, a stronger come-on than pay-off."
3,"Borrow, Don't Buy","This was certainly a fun book, and a quick read, but the author was her own worst enemy. She had certainly done a fantastic amount of research, but it was put together in a fairly sloppy manner and read more like a gossip column than a coherent account of the changing status and position of royal mistresses."
3,"An Interesting, Sometimes Frustrating Overview","It is nigh on impossible to cover 500 years of history in 300 pages, as Eleanor Herman proves. There are so many characters here, so many ""Madames"" and ""Countesses"" that they all begin to look the same. Only Nell Gwynn and Madame de Pompadour stand out in any discernible way. The redundancy of the text (I thought at one point that if Miss Herman said ""one can imagine"" one more time, I might just scream) was ridiculous - the book needed a good editor. I give this three stars because it has inspired me to seek out more information about Nell Gwynn and Madame de Pompadour, and for that I'm grateful. Other than that it's a rather disjointed, slap-dash affair (if you'll pardon that word), and I don't think I need to read anything further from this author."
5,Funny,"""Sex With Kings"" is a funny and sexy read, with all sorts of details about royal mistresses all through history. All those mistresses are different, since some were just mistresses for money and some were really in love with the men they were with. The kings are kind of obnoxious in general, but some of their mistresses were very cool. And it's very funny in places, like the story of one king who urinated on his mistress's boyfriend, who was hiding from him."
4,A decent read.....,"Dont get me wrong I did like this book a lot....The problem I had is it jumps around between era's, and does go back and forth but it inspired me to learn a lil bit more about Louis XIV,LOL... Its an easy book to read took me about a week of night reading after a long days at work.... Enjoyable for anyone to get a breif history of Kings and their Ladies....."
4,Deliciously Scandalous,"This book provides a grandeur look at the lifestyle of the adored and loathed mistress of the kings. It shows that not only beauty could kept a man, like the king, under a woman's power but also that if the mistress wanted to keep living a flirtatious and lavish lifestyle she had to constantly be on guard."
3,In short...,"All in all, this is more the type of book one reads when one is in a gossipy mood. This book is not meant for serious scholarship, as the author has three primary sources (out of 30-some sources). The author mainly collects what other authors have said and tries to make it sound new by ornate wording.As I said, an interesting read in a gossipy-sense."
4,...the rest of the story.,"""Sex with Kings..."" piques the readers' interest for those little nasty backstairs goings-on for the most part. The author has set up chapters that revolve around various aspects of affairs, such as the central players, who is hurt and helped by the affairs, others' opinions, and the aftermath's losses and gains. Of course, the affairs' impact overall is far-reaching and much greater because of the power of the kings. This book is a compilation of bits and pieces of other books (which are dutifully footnoted and indexed)and inserted in to each chapter which reads as a hodge-podge of tantalizing tidbits. For the reader without the background knowledge of European royalty linage, the jumping around of significant people is daunting to follow. Overall, a fun and interesting book."
5,The one year catholic Bible,I have enjoyed reading the Bible and I am on my second year. I would like to see it on the Kindle soon as it is difficult to carry it with me.
5,Reading the bible each day!,"This year bible is fantastic. Catholics knowledge of the bible in general is so lacking with the exception of the readings from Sunday Mass. Reading the Catholic Yearly Bible is finally giving me an easy enjoyable format of reading, learning and understanding the bible day by day."
3,Disappointing,"I never got a chance to wear the belt, because it never came. But I really would have dug it, because of the bottle caps."
4,"Comments on J.K. Lasser's ""Your Income Tax 2006"" Book","As always, Lasser's book is very helpful for both individualsand professionals for tax preparation. There are a few times when it is a bit difficult to find certain topics in the index,but in general I recommend it. The filled-out sample forms arealso useful."
4,Good reference but . . .,". . . it still takes too much time to do my own taxes. Who wants to spend all that time reading Greek? Tax laws just change way too much! Besides, I was an Education major not Business. I found an alternative option online called ProFaxTax after spending a lot ot time doing Google searches. I'll probably still keep buying the book for reference purposes and to ask intelligent questions of the people at ProFaxTax, but I won't be doing my taxes myself anymore."
4,"Works fine, but how much faster is it really?","The thing works as it's supposed to, but it seems only marginally faster, and tends to get a bit more whites in with the yolks than if I was doing the separating by hand. Now, I've only separated 6 eggs with it, so perhaps more speed will come with more experience; the sixth egg was certainly faster for me to separate than the first two were.Note: the directions didn't seem very clear on how to actually do the separation, so I'll note here what my experience was. I had to stick the egg in, sort of horizontally oriented, squeeze the thing to crack the egg, and then pick up the egg and open it up, letting its contents spill into the funnel. Then I had to sort of tilt it at different angles until most of the whites had fallen through into the cup. However, it took quite a bit of doing to get _all_ the whites into the cup, and I always ended up with more whites sticking to the yolk than I could have achieved doing it by hand"
3,Anders Manga - One Up For the Dying,"I first heard of Anders Manga from myspace, yeah I know, leave me alone. I listened to ""Shiver"" and then immediately bought the album, that song alone was very impressive. So I got the CD and that ""sound"" I had heard in Shiver was pretty much throughout the album, ok, so that was his trademark right there. He's darkwave, but it's different from most of the darkwave I have ever heard, it has a bit of an industrial flair to give the music that edge it possesses. So as I listened to the album a few times over, I really did like it, even though some tracks were a bit repetitive. All in all though, the songs were unique enough to make the CD enjoyable. This is a very impressive first release nonetheless. Very good, with room to grow."
5,VERY STRONG IN EVERYTHING,"If you want or need a off or on the road wheelchair then you need to get this,every where i go someone stops me so they can take a picture or just look at it."
4,Use WearEver Wherever,We use these above all others when it comes to cooking. They last long and provide a great non-stick experience in the kitchen.
4,so close to 5 stars,"This cd was wonderful. It fits its title perfectly, and you can imagine a movie based around the descriptive music. Were it not for the dissapointing ""skeleton"" track, this album would deserve 5 stars. I heartily reccomend it anyways."
3,Letdown CD,The book is quite detailed but everybody can put in a few shareware programs and templates on a CD these days. This CD is a complete letdown. I wish they remove the CD and reduce the cost of this book.
2,Disappointing,"This book breezes through the basics and then isn't able to deliver on the advanced. There's very little information about the features and functions but I did find a section on how to dress!!! This is supposed to be about the program POWERPOINT, not about presentation basics.I specifically wanted to understand more about programming templates and add-ins...nothing helpful at all, and sadly, not even enough for a beginner to get a good foundation in this very important concept in powerpoint and in all office components.I was very disappointed and will be returning it as soon as I can wrap it up and ship it back."
4,"I don't own the CD, but...","FYI, the bonus track ""Doggy Fun"" is the song that was playing when Uli's Fasion Week collection was on the runway. Those who watched the season 3 finale and are interested in Uli's music will want to check out the CD.The other 3 Fashion Week runway songs are not on this disk. Laura's collection-song is called ""Laura's Zest"" by Spot On Sounds (Sam Shaffer and Adam Balazs), not on CD to my knowledge but is somewhere on the esnips dot com site. Jeffrey's collection-song is called ""Swing"", by Jeffrey's band which is called Lifter and features Jeffrey on bass and Mike Coulter on vocals; also not on CD to my knowledge but available at the facecrime dot com site. Michael's collection-song is called ""Runaway"", I don't know if it's available anywhere.(I'm sure this CD is fine. ;-)"
2,3rd Edition for Kindle format?,"Can we please get a recent edition? I'm not sure why the hardcover 3rd edition has a date of 2009 and the Kindle-formatted 1st edition has a date of 2010. People living overseas who need this book as a textbook are ""out-of-luck"" if they want to satisfy the 3rd edition requirement..."
1,Not worth it,"I had to purchase this book for an Old Testament class. It is very dry and not very informational. Despite my interest in the topic, I don't think I will read any of it. Normally I would keep a book like this as a shelf resource, but instead, I'll be returning it for cash back."
5,The Right Book,This book is for my current class. I got it at a much more affordable price than the school bookstore.
4,Great results,"After one use my skin was smooth and tight. After two uses my skin tone seemed to be evening out and looking more healthy. After three uses I started getting compliments about how pretty I looked...or that my skin seemed to be glowing. I couldn't be happier with these results. Defintely be careful on how long you keep the product on, start with only about two minutes and increase as your tolerance grows. There is some discomfort as it is on, but mostly just a stinging sensation. Follow the directions and rinse VERY well...more than you think you need to, or else your skin will get quite irritated. Overall a great product if you don't mind a little discomfort and want something to make you ""glow."""
2,Nothing Special,"If you expect dramatic or even undramatic results, don't bother. I really didn't notice a difference in fine lines or the texture of my skin."
1,Plastikote bed liner spray,I used this as a spray on bra for the front of my motorhome. It looked OK for a few days and then it turned yellow. I had to sand it all off and then I did it with Rustoleum bed liner spray (Black). Looks good now but I wanted white color.
3,HASBRO's BETTER,"My son LOVES toy story. He has both figurines sets - the one from hasbro and the one from disney. The hasbro set is SOOOOO much better. In the disney set, the figurines do not have bases so several of them do not stand on their own (woody and jesse) woody's hat has separated from woody and i needed to glue it back together. I would recommend the hasbro set over the disney one if you are debating the purchase. overall tons of fun for the little one with the big imagination!"
5,Toy Story and Beyond,We were very happy with this product. My daughter loves playing with these durable figurines.
3,Great concept needs work,"My mom purchased this set for my 4 year old son for his birthday. He is very into the Toy Story movies and really enjoyed getting the figurines to act out the movies scenes. However, several of the key characters (Jessie, Woody, Bullseye) are made so narrow that they do not stand on their own, so it makes it difficult to act out a scene. Plus, they are made of that painted rubber and it took quite a few days before they ""aired"" out.Overall, a good concept, but we were disappointed that not all of the pieces would stand on their own."
4,toy story 2,"came as promised. good size for little fingers and big imaginations. i was so glad to find these, as the disney store seems to only carry the very big, very expensive toy story characters. the paint is coming off a little bit, but probably because the kids are chewing on them (1 1/2 year old and almost 3 year old)."
5,Great character toys,"We gave this set to our son for Christmas, he has seen the Toy Story movies, but more than that, his favorite toy is a Woody figure with the pull string on his back. But now I think he enjoys having a selection of characters from the movie. Since Christmas morning, he has been playing with them from morning to night, always carrying at least two of them in his hands. He sometimes sits with them and talks to them. Although a toddler, he still mouths many of his toys and I have found that although these toys have been in his mouth often, there seems to be no wear and tear on them at all."
4,toy story figurines,"The only complaint I have about this transaction was that when it arrived the container it was in was opened and re-taped. When I wrote to Amazon.com, the customer service rep stated I could return it for a refund but I decided to keep it. It was apparent that this product was not used in any way. My daughter loves the figures and play's with them a lot."
5,Kabbalistic Footnotes,"Read a few of the other reviews.Aryeh z""l is by a modern master of the Kabbalah.Your knowledge and practice of this lore will be vastly enhanced when you read this book, particularly the footnotes.Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation"
5,the best,The 5 books have an amazing translation. There are also helpful pictures and drawings when appropriate. there is an explanation of words that are crucial to the understanding of the parsha when needed.ShalomStan
4,The Very Original Batman,"What a Great Build this figure is, capturing all the mystique of the 1939-40 Batman. This is Batman before the Batmobile, before there was a Robin. I think it's educational in that it's a slice of history - Batman never again looked like this, never had both the mystery and naivete that his first appearances evoked. Get one for your collection!"
2,Una novela intracedente,"La historia de Maria una prostitua brasilena en Geneve no es capaz de impresionar al lector, las dudas y situaciones que llevan a Maria en decidirse a la prostitucion carecen de energia y fuerza.Las casi 300 paginas de narrativa carecen de mensaje. Una mujer explorando su propia sexualidad y la exposicion de este problema no son nada nuevo.Si eres un fan de Paulo Cohelo, no desperdicies tu tiempo leyendo este libro, mejor quedate con el recuerdo de sus obras: La Quinta Montana o El Alquimista."
3,Worth the read,Its a good book from Coelho about an interesting topic. How an average girl from Brazil comes to be a prostitute in Europe and how she gets out... About love and how sexual relationships has so much and so little do do with it. Some parts however were disappointing and a bit boring. Great Spanish traduction!
5,me encanto,"este producto en kindle es excelente, el libro es excelente para leer y recomendar a los amigos, estoy conforme con el producto,"
2,Se fue la magia,"Desgraciadamente la magia no se siente aqui, es un libro que carece de profundidad y no hace sentir nada al lector."
5,Would of given it 6 stars... ir if had that many.,"The quality of this hat is wonderful, it also fits perfectly, and looks top notch. I give it 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, and 1 attaboy."
2,Warps in the oven,"The product tends to warp in the oven and loses its shape so it does not remain flat. Once it cools, the pan reverts back to it's original shape."
2,For obsessive completists only,"The rest of their catalog ranges from good (""Crashing Dream"") to godlike (""Emergency Third Rail Power Trip"", ""Explosions in the Glass Palace"", ""Beyond the Sunset""), but don't buy this one for musical reasons. I've got it, and if I lost it I'd have to replace it, but that's only because I'm an obsessive completist."
2,Below my expectations,"Princeton Review typically puts together good packets of information - this is not one of them. Although my cyber colleagues are chiding the raves about this booklet, it was not very insightful to me. Although the mini lessons provide a topical guide about material to be covered in business school, a bulk of the information is more like pulp fiction - what type of environment, colleagues, lifestyle, etc. to expect. I would not recommend this book."
5,Excellent resource for MBA students,This book is excellent. It provides a clear view of what life is really like in business school and I think it's a must for any MBA students. (Recent grads would also find it very entertaining.
3,"Great concept, not well written","When my acccountant described the Smith Manoeuvre, I was very interested and picked up the book. While not entirely well written (he rambles on about politics, the Canadian Alliance and Joe Clark) the core concept is sound and I'll be implementing this manouevre to start leveraging the principle gained in my current mortgage to get tax deductions.His examples are not entirely intuitive. If he spent more time on explaining the fundementals and less on rah rah, it would make for a less confusing read.That being said, despite the poor writing, his ""manoeuvre"" is great and the book is worth every penny. It'll get you on your way to getting tax deductions on your personal residential mortgage, and more importantly, increasing your net worth."
3,Very very good album!,"If you like REAL housemusic to relax with, buy this cd!! It's a pitty i can't buy it cause i've had this album until a couple of years ago and lost it.. :-( And i've been searching for a simulair album ever since.. Well.. hope it helps when i rank this album and write a review cause it's really more than just an album! it's .. well.. see for yourself (if it's in the stocks again)"
4,Gut Bustin,I will never look at men the same again. So funny! But I it was kind of disappointing that he didn't talk about DMT though.
3,Not Funny.,"I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan, and couldn't wait to watch this. Rogan's 2006 stand up act is still one of my all time favorites. The way Joe delivers his routines keeps you hanging on every word, as he is a great story teller. But in all honesty, I didn't find this one very funny at all. Throughout the entire 40 minutes or so, I laughed once, maybe twice. I wouldn't pay for this, but it's worth a watch if you can see it for free."
2,Disappointing,"Dr. Glenmullen does a fine job of underscoring the importance of carefully tapering offantidepressants. This is tremendously important because many MDs, psychopharmacologists included,take a casual, potentially damaging approach to the process of discontinuing these meds.I found the book very well intentioned, but redundant. Glenmullen makes a set of points over and over again, yet he doesn't deal at all with other relevant issues, i.e. nutritional supplements which have been found helpful to patients weaning off these medications. Although the subtitle of his first book, ""Prozac Backlash""suggests that it covers ""effective alternatives"" there is no mention whatsoever of alternative approaches here. (I haven't read ""Prozac Backlash"" -- I'm just surprised that that sort of valuable information would be addressed in the author's first work and entirely ignored in the second, especially when it might be highlyuseful for people concerned with getting off anti-depressants."
2,Book didn't offer a VIABLE alternative for me,"I've been suffering from panic disorder all my life.I've tried all of the so-called alternatives mentioned in the book, plus few more. None worked. Though I did learn some important skills along the way. But I've still required SSRI's.One thing I've learned over the years is to stay clear of clinicians who seem to have an ""agenda"". Whether it be pro-meds, or anti-meds. This auther obviously has a ANTI-med agenda. Fine. Then offer a viable alternative.The truth of the matter is that many people with depression, anxiety and panic need BOTH meds AND non-pharmalogical treatment (PT, CBT...etc.)SSRI's are not the enemy, depression and anxiety are!"
4,Excellent reference!,"If you actively manage your own health care and are interested in finding out whether it's time to stop antidepressant medication, AND you do NOT have a serious psychological disorder such as bi-polar, severe depression, etc., then this book is for you. This book provides accurate, simple and clear instructions for any physician and patient."
3,OK,"A fair amount of information about what someone can do other than surgery to get help for back issues. The majority of the info is about different treatments, but other than a few exercises, its information only. Not much in the way of hands on things an individual can do for themselves."
2,Not soft or natural feeling,"I had to send this back. I wrote a review that seems to have been taken down for some reason. I will re-post my review and hope it stays up. I received an email from the seller after requesting a return, telling me that this is wool sliver knit to a polyester backing. I don't dispute that it is wool on a synthetic backing. The problem is with its lack of softness and unnatural smell. I personally wouldn't lay my baby on it, even with a sheet over it."
1,SYNTHETIC!!!!!,I purchased this product directly from Snugglewool. I was really excited to buy this product for my baby's crib but was so upset when received it. It does not look like natural wool at all. It feels like synthetic!!!!!!! Not soft!!! The pictures depict a different product. I am so disappointed. I would love to find a NATURAL LAMB WOOL pad for my baby's crib. Anyone?
3,"Warm, adequate.","Warm. Rug-like laminated backing. Not exactly soft, but ok under a sheet. Vastly overpriced for what it is. Would return if not for the hassle. Disappointing."
3,A good description of XML,"This book does a great job at describing XML. It does not contain any exercise (although it contains some codes) to help you get your feet wet.This is a good reference book. If you are a beginner, you will still need another book to help you get started."
2,bloated,"This book is 1000+ pages long, and if the needless repetition and endless reproductionof the baseball statistics were omitted it would be half the size, and far more useful.To be sure, teaching and learning styles differ. But we are trying to learn XML herenot become experts on RBI's, home runs, steals.. etc. Just a couple of stats wouldhave been enough to constitute a sufficient example of attributes.The Unix user will also find, if he wishes to try them on his own desktop,that the examples require as the XSL processing instructions are missing the ""version"" attribute,and have the xmlns:xsl attribute pointing to a URL which Firefox doesn't like.(Windows Explorer finds them acceptable, most probably due to laxer checking).I would say buy a book whose author believes than less can be more,as it certainly is with this tome."
5,I took a chance,"I was looking 4 new music and seen this album had 5 stars so I got it, love it and you should take a chance and do the sameone love to all my b-boys & b-girls"
3,A Solid Effort!,"This is an early attempt to analyze Internet psychology. Patricia M. Wallace uses established psychological research - where it applies - to lay the foundation for understanding Internet psychology. Wherever possible, she cites contemporary Internet psychology research in presenting her opinions and conclusions; the problem is that there isn't any. She finds very few compelling Internet research studies, and she's the one who knows where to look. This book is just a little early out of the dock. The Internet is evolving so quickly that discussion of research conducted on Usenet groups already seems quaint. We [...] recommend this book to people who want a general psychological review of the impact of the Internet. However, the same lightening-fast change that makes these questions so fascinating also makes it very difficult to pin down the answers."
2,Very Disappointing,"This text is more in the genre of sociology than of internet specificity. Although there are considerable implications, Ms Wallace does not make a real connection between the internet and sociological constructs describing group operation. The treatment is very superficial and comprises a lot of suppositions which are rarely supported by real research or active hypotheses under investigation. The one valid point made is that the term 'internet addiction' may be entirely without merit, as there has been no research demonstrating compliance with DSM-IV definitions of addiction."
3,GRANDFATHER'S DREAM,THE STORY IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE AND GIVES A CHILD INSIGHT INTO LIFE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND CULTURE.
5,"The Hittite Ritual of Tunnawi, it was all I had hoped it would be.","""The Hittite Ritual of Tunnawi"" is a translation of an Hittite text regarding the rituals surrounding the purification of individuals who have become ritually impure. The work is very interesting on an historical basis, but it also includes a transliteration of the Hittite text which is helpful to the student of Hittite. The book assumes a basic knowledge of Hittite grammar. I was very pleased with ""The Hittite Ritual of Tunnawi""."
3,My thoughts on Floral Garden Valance.....,"My thoughts on the Floral Garden Valances are that the photo caught me off guard. I misread and thought that I was purchasing the curtains in the listed photo. Nope. I received two pretty purple valances, that have cute floral designs. They were long in length and were seemingly of good quality. I didn't want to send them back because of the hassle of waiting.So know that you are only buying the valances and not the curtains. They are in the photo I guess to enhance the valances look. I just used them to put on the wall attached to curtain rods above my girls' beds like a headboard decoration. It works and is a different look that adds character too their room.All in all, ok buy."
2,Bad Instructional Video,"This DVD, like a lot of others, assumes that you already know how to play the fiddle. I do wish that beginner videos were really for beginners. It would have been a total waste of money had it not come with sheet music so I could at least figure out what he was doing. I do not recommend this for anyone who does not already know the note placement on the finger board or for anyone who cannot play by ear."
4,Monitor problem solved!,"I ordered this monitor as a replacemet for my old one. Because I was short on money, this seemed like the perfect choice... and it was.The display is awesome, with only one little problem: the lower left corner's color tends to be a bit more green.As a replacement for old monitors, or a cheap solution to a monitor problem, this is a great choice, but if you have money to spare, go with a better known company's product."
2,promising but major flaws,I bought this unit as a lower cost secondary monitor for my home office. Even though it has great specs and can do really sharp colors and text at high resolutions I had a major problem with the geometrics. It was so hard to get the pincushion out of the picture and keep the whole thing straight that I returned the unit for the Samsung 753df which was so much better.
1,Bad experience with the EN-770E,"I bought this monitor from Staples because it was a very good price for a flat screen with a mail in rebate. Immediately upon powering it up I noticed that the CRT was poorly centered in the 'window' of the plastic surrounding the glass and I felt it was inexcusable for a new monitor to have such a obvious defect.I took it back and exchanged it for another monitor of the same model. That one also had a defect that caused the bottom left of the display to curve in just enough to be annoying. No amount of adjustment could completely compensate for it.Back to Staples for a third time to return it for refund. If the manufacturer had such poor quality control that it let very obvious defects slip through, what can one conclude about the parts you cannot see inside the monitor?Thanks to Staples though for accepting the first exchange and the final return without a problem though!"
3,You Get What You Pay For,"If you like your martial arts brutal and merciless,martial arts master Sonny Chiba's ""Streetfighter""movies are for you.The plots are good, but you know that the reason for beingof these movies is to showcase fighting skills and in thatthey do not disappoint.Unfortunately, the video quality of this (Digiview)version of the first two of the four moviesin the""Streetfighter"" series is poor,what you would expect from an amateur bootleg.The price is right and reflects what you are receiving,therefore it's a good value if you want to sample these moviesin widescreen format without spending much money.After viewing them, you will want a better quality video."
5,Very good for children with a learning disability,"My 5 year old grandson has CP and is learning to dress himself. Although the process is slow, it is steady and the Dressing Sequence Toy will help him with two-handed coordination necessary to accomplish this task. The button, velco strap, etc. are just the right size for his fingers. This toy is well-made and very functional."
5,Entertaining and Enjoyable Read,This is a book that no Reds fan should be without. Even baseball fans in general should consider picking up this gem. The chapters flow well throughout the book and the writing is entertaining. Stupp has done a tremendous job of tying in outside resources to further detail Browning's stories.
1,"Dreadful, even by sports book standards.",This might be a mildly entertaining book for a 14-year old. But no one who has followed the Reds since Browning's time will learn a single new fact. Even the old facts are told in a boring and disjointed manner. How can a person who knew Marge Schott and Pete Rose write a book without giving a bit of insight into their character and motivations?
3,Overpriced.,"I bought this to go with the doll for my granddaughter. Very overpriced for what you get and she'd prefer to use her ""real"" diapers when playing with her dolls. Should have saved the money......"
5,Wonderful Gaithers,The gaither video back home in indiana is there best video ever. The biggest reason I like it is because it has John Peirce in it and as big fans will know he left the vocal band. I dont know why so if someone can get back to me on why i would appreciate it. The video is filled with wonderful songs and as usual everyone in the band is singing from the heart. Thanx......
5,Why I like Kathryn Kuhlman,"Well, to be honest, the reason I like Katie Kuhlman is because she was a homewrecker. She busted up a marriage and ran off with the guy in a brief but not all too talked about episode of her life. This suggests to me that if God can use an adulteress like Katie, then hell, he can use any of us now can't he?"
3,Basic,"Basic Micro text for MA/PhD students. Very bland and not interesting textbook, but most Micro books are similar. Have not opened text since completing course."
2,Needs work,"I used this text in an intermediate microeconomic theory course, but have a math background. The first half of the text is acceptable - concepts are presented well, and there are a good number of examples. The biggest problem is that the author or typesetter seems to not understand the correct use of parenthesis - many of the formulae are not correct! The section on game theory, which is the second half of the book, is quite poor. Greater depth is needed, and crucial theory is glanced over. It would be fine for a course which doesn't get past chapter 12 or so, but look elsewhere for game theory."
5,An Excellent shoe,I've put good mileage on these and I have absolutely no complaints. I wish they would come in a different color but for running you can't find a better shoe. Lots of cushioning!
4,"Clear, concise, and well thought out","Atomic Absorption and Plasma Spectroscopy is a well thought out introduction to absorption and emission spectroscopy. The author presents the principles involved in AA, GFAA, ICP-AES, and ICP-MS in a clear and concise manner and provides self-assessment questions so readers can measure their understanding of the various subjects as they are presented. The author avoids unnecessary details in describing instrumentation while maintaining crystal clarity about how the systems work. Typical is the description of the Echelle spectrometer which could not have been easier to understand. The diagrams supported by concise narratives on distinctly uncluttered pages can hardly be improved upon. If you are looking for a good introduction to this subject you need look no further."
2,dull,this was a dull book with nothin new in it.. i only finished it coz i had nothin else to read... not worth the 4 star rating it got
5,"A ""Must Have"" book for iSeries programmers","This is a great book on the topic of SQL within the realm of IBM midrange platforms. It covers not only the obvious topics (interactive SQL, basic SELECTs etc.) but goes in depth on the topics of QM Manager, SQL within iSeries Navigator and interfacing SQL with MS Office. It is big on the practical aspects of SQL and is easy to read and understand."
2,Not worth you money though mostly not worth your time...,"This game is nothing special. I have played every EA Sports hockey game since its inception and I am not impressed. The online game play is not realistic. You will win games and lose games and feel like your skill is not making a difference. Very frustrating. Online some games you will win 6-0 with out even trying and other you will lose 10-0 in the same breath. There doesn't seem to be a rythme or reason to this game. Overall the controls are generall very numb. The defense players are non existent. This game may be cheaper this year though forget the money, don't waste you time giving this game a chance, you will be disapointed."
4,My Favorite In The Series,"In this book Cecil Younger is hired by a 97-year old man to kill someone. He takes the case, intending to discover who was responsible for the killing of a single mother, Angela Ramirez. Along the way he travels from southeast Alaska to Centralia, Washington and learns about a massacre there in 1919 involving the American Legion and the Wobblies.I've enjoyed the Cecil Younger series, but cringe at some of the violence. In this book I liked the problem of him taking his mentally challenged roommate with him to Centralia while investigating Angela Ramirez's murder. I especially liked learning the story of the Veteran's Day violence back in 1919. It was very interesting. Because of this story from history this book is my favorite in the series."
5,"Great Backup---> ""**UPDATE** Horrible Backup""","After knowing to steer clear of the inherantly buggy external software, this drive fits my use as raw data storage point perfectly. I'm about to buy my second one, despite even MORE negative ratings than were around when i first bought one. It looks good, runs quiet, is very plug and play savvy, and works well as an extra storage point since i have 2 internals and 2 externals to hold movies i am editing.**UPDATE**- Well reading my nice review abve, i guess those negative reviews were there for a good reason and i just got lucky for awhile. My HDD died, inexplicably, and i was luckily able to recover the data by tearing the case to shreds. I rarely used it, so i'd say it survived maybe 800 spin-ups at best. Ridiculously unreliable, STEER CLEAR!"
4,"Works Well, lacks software instructions","I use it to backup my laptop. When I got a new computer, I couldn't figure out how to copy the old hard drive onto the new one, so I just dragged-and-dropped my data files"
4,Cool iCarly show,"This is a cool iCarly show where Carly unintentionally challenges Shelby to a pretend fight. Then Nevel makes up a story and Shelby thinks Carly purposefully pushed her grandmother and so when the fight starts, she doesn't fake it. But, in the end Carly and Shelby are friends again."
3,Episodes Already Released on DVD,"This DVD set is ok, but at this point you can find 5 of this DVD's 6 episodes on theiCarly: Season Two, Volume TwoDVD set.This set contains the following episodes:iFight Shelby Marx, Parts 1 & 2iLook AlikeiDate a Bad Boy, Parts 1 & 2iCarly AwardsOf those 6 episodes, only 'iCarly Awards' can not be found on the Season 2, Volume 2 set. If you haven't already purchased this DVD, then the Season 2, Volume 2 set might be the way to go."
5,Heavy weight for strong chewers,"These are large rolls of extra-thick hide. I'm very pleased to buy such a nice product made in the USA. My dogs are pretty strong chewers, and these rolls last a long time."
3,Dog Not Interested,"I bought this for my seven month old puppy, who has never had rawhide previously. I was searching for a chew that would last longer than a half hour. This is a heavy chew of excellent quality and I think it would last a long time, with heavy chewing. After a couple of attempts to chew it, the puppy has no interest in it. I will give the second one I bought to a friend's dog."
4,Great anywhere traction is needed,"Sorry, I'm not going to be able to review it as a truck bed liner; I bought it to paint on the bottoms of two bathtubs and the floor of a shower stall. I happened across a recommendation for its use as a traction aid in product reviews; it is both surprisingly effective and incredibly easy to apply. I'm no longer concerned when a visitor bathes at my house, the floor and bottoms of the bathtubs are as non-slip as any of the expensive (and woefully short-lived) appliques available in bath shops and home improvement stores can make them, and, if the spray-in liner of my truck is any indicator, may not need to be ""refreshed"" for years; I'll probably replace the tubs and shower before the floors need recoating."
5,Excellent book on Masonic rituals,"I have many books on Freemasonry, both pro and con. I will leave it to you to decide whether or not I am a practicing Mason. Many of these descriptive rituals (and the corresponding description of Masonic symbols, handshakes, etc.) are unavailable elsewhere. I have Albert Pikes ""Morals and Dogma"" and have read it more than most in the brotherhood. Yet this book covers things that Albert Pike dares not reveal! This book is a MUST for anyone interested in the true rituals and symbolism of Freemasonry."
5,It would make a great romance movie!,"Ti Marie is wonderfully written and provides great insight into the history of Trinidad and the colonial practice of slavery. In particular, it shows how cultural adaptations emerged under the different European social-political systems in the West Indies, this all cloaked in the story of two young lovers. With the ups and downs of their romance, Belgrave cleverly describes the multiracial and multicultural fabric that makes Trinidadian society special.She also shows us something of ourselves in each of her characters so that we might recognize the humanity that cultural heterogeneity brings. Clearly the outcome of the romance is fiction, particularly for those times, but might we not hope for a world where such love can flourish and where the possible children of such unions can be accepted and proud of who they are.Lastly, this novel gives us lots to think and talk about. It's perfect for book clubs. And, it would make a great romance movie!"

5,To all Americans,"We live literally across the street from each other - Canadians and Americans. But Americans don't really know us. This book shows our big hearts, humor, valiant spirit, courage and creativity. Every American should read this book and learn just a little bit more about the people who use strange words like ""eh"" and ""toque""! Come on up and visit - or better yet, read this book. The folks who were stranded in Gander, Newfoundland on September 11 will tell you that every word is the truth."
4,PARIS,"First of all let me state that one star for this book is absolutely ridiculous, I must confess, I dont hold a PH.D in Parisian architecture, but i do know a thing or two about Paris, and this book is excellent, there are images and information about the architecture of Paris, that I had not seen before. I love Paris, and have always been fascinated with the architecture and Hausemans layout of Paris. If you have any interest in the architectural history of Paris, then really I cannot imagine you not having some appreciation of this book, maybe when your in Paris you can run by the afore mentioned reviewers copy he left out of disgust and save yourself some money. Highly recommended."
3,A comrehensive guide to Paris architecture,"This slim guide is one of the most comprehensive guides to Paris architectural style over its history. Though the guide is very good,it omits alot but is still a really great resource to walk you through the centuries of building in the city. If you love architecture or Paris or both you will enjoy this book which is chock full of color photos, lithographs, old maps and desriptions of styles, movements and the history behind these. If you are a student or a tourist this is a fun guide."
4,Paris: An Architectural History,the book will serve to be very beneficial to my daughter which is studying architecture in Paris.
4,Lovely brief encounter,"This is a daughter's loving collection of some of her favorite moments with her father, Winston. I was moved to tears and laughter and read it all in an afternoon. A touching tribute well worth reading."
4,Something very different,"Definitely not for everyone. I want to describe this music and I can't seem to do it. If you like John Fahey's more dissonant moods you might like this. I want to emphasize the word ""might."" This is quirky stuff and there are no guarantees."
2,Misleading,"I was led to believe (1) the pendant was larger than it was (2) that the yin yang part had two parts. Instead, I got a pendant that was so tiny you couldn't tell what it was, and what made it two parts was that the fire sun part came out (and wouldn't pop back in."
1,wireless controller for xbox,"I was let down by this product. it was great that its wireless, but it would activate by itself , if you left the controller alone, it would make the character on screen look up all the time. this was very annoying. I had thrown the box away after x-mas. so I can't return it. I happily threw it away in the trash.ssnwash@sisna.com"
3,Solid Job by Author's,"I think you always know what you are going to get with a Time Life Book, a well put together, full off details, and highly illustrated book and this is no exception. The book acts as an overview of the major known serial killers in the past 250 years in he United States. He details out each person, the crimes they committed, how they were found out and captured and what happened to them. Overall an interesting book and a good broad outline on the topic. If this is what you are looking for then his is a good pick up."
4,Love it,"This is my all-time favorite snap-off knife. I have had mine for two years. I thought they were discontinued, so am happy to find it here. I have also a metal handled, heavy duty 25mm snap-off, but like this one MUCH better. It is more comfortable in my hand and the blades are sharper. I worry that the plastic knob might break, as another reviewer said, but mine is still fine. I've used this knife for everything, including cutting up a whole house full of wall-to-wall carpet and padding, and it worked great! Going to buy one or two more in case they decide only to make ""better"" ones in the future. To me, this one is best...love it."
2,too wide,My daughter has them in white. They are fashionable and cute but the problem which is a really big one is that they are EXTREMELY wide. She looks goofy. I don't recomend them.
2,Cute,They sort of work but its easier and quicker to use a knife. They take up room in then gadget drawer
4,Multi-use Kitchen Scoop,"These scoops are great for a lot of things. There are some fruits that work better than others. I wouldn't recommend using them on things that are harder like apples or pears. Cantaloupe, watermelon, and kiwi have all been successes for me. I have found that the medium scoop can also substitute as an ice cream scooper should the need arise."
