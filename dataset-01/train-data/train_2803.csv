1,extremely poor quality,"This costume is super cheaply made and looks awful. The hat is floppy. The rest of the costume is just stupid looking.I sent it back, and made a costume by dying a white cotton shirt, and pants and a white silk tie (all from discount stores) and spray painting a hat that I made with paper mache. The cost was comparable to this costume, but it was a lot more work.Don't buy it-- unless you have really low standards, it's pretty much unusable."
2,Poor quaity materials and workmanship,Every body loved that I dressed up but this is a one time costume. It is cut poorly and will probably fall apart after the 2 hours you wear it. I had to weave a piece of wire into the brim to keep it from drooping.
3,very funny,"Very funny costume. Brim on hat is floppy and doesn't look like photo, need to stiffen up by gluing cardboard on. Husband looks kind of like demented scare-crow. But too busy to make a costume so this will have to do. Does fit fine even though he is an XL."
3,Soapy White Floral,"Based on my experience with 1881 Collection, I was hopeful that 1881 might be just as good and snagged a mini parfum (75% vol) the moment that I found it. Unfortunately, 1881 is a soapy white floral on me. It's pretty but uninteresting and characterless.Note to self: Stop giving straight-up florals a chance. They just aren't that into you."
5,7 years and still going,"We bought this seven years ago at a kite fair. It was the best purchase ever! We use it every year and it's still working like new. We have three boys and they have all used it (and fight over it). We original bought it for our son who has limited use of his left arm and he took to it right away. Unfortunately when we bought it, it was the last one and we never found another one until now. We're buying more for gifts for the cousins now as they love to use it when they visit as well. I highly recommend this for any kids who love to fly kites!"
2,Keith B. Avery,"Love this group of r&b legends and didn't know what to expect from them for a Christmas CD. Well, I wasn't impressed.....sorry guys!"
3,photo confusing,Which photo is the actual roaster offered? The roaster depicting touch button controls--------or the up close photo of a dial control????????
2,wears down too easy,"this product came with no case, (I don't consider that weird pink gummy bear a case) at first I was like ""no biggie"" and just went with it, it worked great for a while, then I noticed it started to bend when putting it in machines, sides of it are starting to flake off, and the exposed board on the bottom still gets me antsy. it now sits at my desk, still working, but barely. My friend also bought two, the first he kept on his keyring like me, but one day when he put it in a machine it just all of a sudden ripped open, and he lost all the data on the drive. DO NOT CARRY THIS ON YOUR KEYRING!"
1,"Died in a couple of months... when it worked, it was slow on some machines","The title says all, it is inexpensive and it fits in the wallet, but too expensive if you count the useful life."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"This product worked for about 5 minutes...and never worked again. It's extremely flimsy and you'd be lucky if it lasted more than a day. It's a great conversation piece, it's just too bad it doesn't work."
1,disgruntled,"I've owned two of these because of how handy it is due to its size. unfortunately, both of them died within a month or two of owning them. I would like to purchase another, but I cannot afford to keep buying a new one ever two months just to keep some documents with me at all times.it is a great product in its short-short lifespan."
1,Piece of junk! Stay away!,"I bought this product because of its tiny size (fits in a wallet!) and ok price. It worked for just 2 months and now Windows doesn't recognize it anymore.Now I'm buying a Sony Micro Vault, which is about the same size but cost more. You should do the same."
2,If only the book delivered on the title...,"A very disappointing book about a fascinating subject. Goldsmith appeals neither to the evolutionary biologist nor the casual interested party with this work. No cohesive thoughts run through the book, and Goldsmith is never sure exactly who the audience of his book really is. Examples are strewn together with nothing to tie them together or into a central theme. You can do much better than this book."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Justice League of America Archives, Vol. 3 Archive Edition is another fine bunch of adventures from DC's premier super team. These are nice, if rather pricey and heavy, making the price even worse here, so hopefully the Showcases will get all this stuff eventually.Anyway, more Gardner Fox and company JLA goodness."
2,Too short for Cal King Box Springs,"I've used this product for about a week now. Every time I put my shoes on in the morning I feel the foot of the bed sink about an inch and a half. At first I thought this was the new mattress, but upon further inspection, it was the box spring flexing where the frame stopped. The frame is not long enough to support a cal king set."
2,Poor Packaging left item damaged,"This small box of nails/pins was shipped in a padded envelope. When I received the item, the box of nails/pins was blown open and nail/pins were floating around throughout the padded envelope. That would have been okay, but over 1/3 of the nails/pins had broken apart from the groupings of 100 that they are to be held together in and placed in the nailer. I hope that the seller improves the packaging beccause they are offering this item at a pretty good price and that is the reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 1."
5,Fun Way to Expand Your Vocabulary,"This sets contains 5 CDs and goes through about 150 words. Of all Word Smart Vocabulary Building set CDs, this one has the most interesting words.The first CD covers the vocabulary related to: Cruel to Be Kind; Country Mouse and City Mouse.The second CD coverts the vocabulary related to: For Better or for Worse; War and Peace.The third CD covers the vocabulary related to: From Mountains to Molehills; Rogers and Hart.The fourth CD covers the vocabulary related to: Earth and Sky; Womb to Tomb.The fifth CD covers the vocabulary related to: Socrates and Plato; Mutt and Jeff.The recordings are very entertaining to listen to. After defining the words, they are dramatized, often in a humorous way, adding fun to the learning process."
2,"Good production, lacks etymology, academic rigor","There are some good words on the five CDs (a bargain), although it takes some initial breaking in to not be annoyed by the flamboyant speakers. What the CD completely lacks, as it was purported to have, is a discussion of the roots of words. This discussion was rarely had, and in one case (to my knowledge), was incorrect. Not for any serious Classics student hoping to reconnect with contemporary roots."
4,Pricey but entertaining vocabulary review recordings...,"While I think this product is overpriced, it does do a good job of presenting new vocabulary words. The dialogue between the narrators is funny and their voices aren't annoying. Other reviewers may complain that their examples are contrived, but I think that was the point: they wanted to think of colorful examples so the listeners would remember them better. The selection of words is good as well. I don't retain information well by listening to it, but this is an entertaining way to improve your vocabulary while you are driving or don't have time to sit down and seriously study."
1,Forget it!,"This was the most disappointing CD. I have a long commute so I thought this would be great opportunity to brush up on my vocabulary. This is a great CD if you want to impress people with words they will have to ask you the meaning of. Totally ridiculous!Most of the words sounded like another language. Not a way to improve your language skills, but the best way to isolate yourself and show your superiority. At the same time I bought the Verbal Advantage book. Great!! That is a gradual transition from common vocabulary to more complex, it's your choice. That's something that I think was lacking with this CD. Break out the cheese and wine and impress your leftist friends. Oh, I forgot to mention the Barbara Streisand and Bill & Hillary examples, wonder which way these people lean???This rating system only goes as low as one star, otherwise I would have choosen 0 stars.Save your hard earned money and buy something that is useful."
3,Different Kind of Beach Read,"An offbeat werewolf tale, lighthearted but also dark in equal measures. recommended."
3,Moral Werewolves of Manhattan,"This is the first book by Sparkle Hayter that i've read.The heroine of the novel, Annie, is a milquetoast legal secretary who turns into a werewolf during the full moon. She has a special instinct, and only kills those people with a stinking soul. Her story develops alongside the psychiatrist-werewolf who is bent into controlling all those with lycanthropic disorder, a washed-up news anchor who breaks the story, his awful wife, plus an array of picturesque characters. As there were so many, pages and pages will go without a mention of them. For example, Sam, the news anchor, is absent from a good portion of the center pages, and he is a crucial figure. The same thing happened with other minor characters, like Razz, Liz, Henry, etc.I did not understand the title pun, as this doesn't really have much to do with Naked Lunch. The novel was entertaining, easy to read, not very profound despite the good moral message. Still, a good book to read right before going to bed."
4,Fuggin' hell,"Great to see this re-release. I still remember the first time I saw something by The Fugs. I was in the record shop and and I found myself with an album in my hand that somehow managed to get in there. Quite curious how it got there I looked at the title: ""It Crawled Into My Hand, Honest"" by The Fugs. So that explained why I was holding it and it turned out to be the best excuse when somebody asked you how the H... you could have bought that album. Since I love guys with a good sense of humor, I bought the album and I never ever regretted doing so. Anarchy and nihilism, laughter and anger, bombastic rockopera in a circus package, that's The Fugs. Listening to the cd's now you hear that they were a document of their time. One can hear they are 35 years old, but they still are great fun to the not too easily insulted or fainthearted. And now I want It Crawled.... on cd too!"
5,Carpe Fugum,"A scrappy happy antidote to the streamlined blare of ultraslick melody makers. What The Fugs First Album lacked in polish though it more than supplied the want in anarcho-comical fark you attitude. A period piece now to be sure, a relic, but one that remains for me oddly comforting and frankly indispensable--there's still nothing like Tuli and the boys singing Slum Goddess or My Baby Done Left Me or Nothing to thoroughly recombobulate the banjaxed brainbox. Subversive imperfection never sounded so redoubtable. Like the dude sez here, cacophony forever.And wasn't that amped-up and spliffy live version of CIA Man over the closing credits of the Coen brothers' Burn After Reading just an inspired fugging choice? The answer is like totally yup and yessum if you ask me."
5,One of a kind,"I'll just get right to describing the disc. Shorter songs than normal, on average. Songwriting style (lyrically) that could be considered very artisitic or just guys screing around trying to be vulgar in a pop-music format, dependign on your perspective.Singing: Too many people singing at once, with no attempt at perfection, or slick-ness.instruments: Standard pop-rock instruments, but a little heavy on the odd percussion (but so was Bo Diddley). Some guys know how to play. Some do not. Bassist John Anderson is fascinating in his ""I know a little"" approach, and would have been a famous musician in backwoods string bands in the early 20th century. I love his stuff. His style tends to ""country folk"" here, just a wall of noise there.production: They must have done this all in one take. This is raw. Heavy, in a primituive ""pre-metal"" way. It was the 60's. Could not be done today."
4,Great peace loving fun,"Though not as focused or as memorable as The Belle of Avenue A (where can you find this album now?), the Fugs First Album is great fun. I enjoyed the We are the Fugs anthem and Nothing, as well as some of the additional cuts and interviews at the end of the CD. I was born in '68 so I missed the exciting era that the Fugs were depicting here."
2,"Funky, 60's garage band with laugh along lyrics","Sort of a cross between Dylan and Gallagher with tunes such as ""Boobs Alot"" (do you like them)"
3,Be careful of the squirts,"I love the metal aspect. I am not a fan of pouring boiling liquid into plastic. That said, this is only a one cup french press and unless you leave the top inch or two free of water/coffee it squirts.I have tried gently pressing . . . ever so slowly, and with bare millimeters at a time. But it almost always squirts coffee and grounds out.I wish there was one of these that was double the size, then I wouldn't mind leaving the top inch or so free of water."
5,"Late Show/ Volume 2 (Etta James and Eddie ""Cleanhead""Vinson)",This is the best album Etta James has ever recorded. I should know....I own all of hers.....and Cleanhead is at his best. I'd Rather Be A Blind Girl is so raw and uncut and so Etta. I never get tired of listening to this entire CD. I recommend it highly.
4,Sweet yet sexy look at the first time.,"It reminded me of the first time I made love to my best friends sister. Although I cried reading a couple of stories, I found most of them to very exciting indeed. I would definitely suggest this book to ""curious"" women before they act upon their desires."
1,Not very erotic if that's what you're looking for,"If you're like me and you like lesbian erotica, you might think this would be a great book. i mean heck, it's real life events, not fiction. Well, for the most part I found many of the stories to be almost... clinical. A lot she-said-she-said and they were woefully short on the descriptive narrative. If you're looking for a real erotic read, look elsewhere. I never even finished the book."
1,Disappointing...,"Based on the previous reviews of the book I was expecting so much more but was very disappointed. The stories were not any diiferent than what you can find off the Net, so if you have a computer, save your money and just scan the net. Also, the stories all sounded the same - quite repetitive. If that's what I have to look forward to, I'll stay celibate."
2,Absolutly Horrible!,"There was definitely nothing erotic about this book. If anything it took the magic away from how amazing this experience can really be. It did have some eliment of sentiment but other than that it bored me, and I found it hard to get threw many of the stories, and eventually gave up."
5,Incredible. Impossible to put down.,"This is one of the most incredible books I have ever read. I can't put it down. The stories are interesting and emotional. I highly reccomend this to anyone, male or female, straight, gay or bi. It is especially helpful for those that are bi-curious. I believe it gives an accurate picture of what it's like for lesbian and bisexual women to start a relationship for another woman. The pre-Stonewall stories are especially interesting from a historical standpoint."
5,"Absolutely invaluable! Read BEFORE reading ""Tale of Genji""","Social/historical study of various *aspects* (not a true ""history"") of Heian Japan that really, REALLY helps one understand the behavior/attitudes of the characters in ""Tale of Genji""! The ""Genji"" genealogical charts & character listing in the appendices - by themselves - justify the price (keep it at your side when reading Genji!). Furthermore, the book is entertaining to read as the author actually knows how to write well. I would also recommend this book to anyone that didn't plan to read ""Genji"" but was curious about that period of Japanese culture.AND - if you are a student that has an assignment to read GENJI and don't have time to read all of the 900+ pages of the original - you could probably fake your way through any exam after reading this! (And will later be curious enough to slog through the original).I will probably read this book a second time."
5,Beautiful!,This looks to be a very good book! Your service was great! Thanks for getting this to me so promptly!
1,"Yep--another ""mine is broken"" story","I had the exact same experience as ""A customer from Sunnyvale"" with our ""Steam 'n Press.My wife bought this to steam her wedding dress on her wedding day. It (apparently) worked that one time. However, it didn't get used until a few months later, and I couldn't get anything to happen with the steam. My wife and I fiddled with it for a good long time, and ultimately decided that something is broken with the mechanism that discharges the steam. The ""iron"" portion of this still gets hot--but as ""Sunnyvale"" said, without the steam this thing is useless.One use and done--that's unacceptable. I contacted Rowenta (a long distance call, BTW) and since the item is less than a year old if I send it to them (at my expense, probably $10 or so) they say they'll fix it and send it back to me. I'll probably do this, but from other complaints of this unit breaking it seems like the quality control isn't there. Save yourself trouble and go with something else."
5,It actually does what it says,After reading other reviews I had my doubts about the performance of this product but was plesantly surprised at the results. You must understand that this steam iron will not give you the same results you would get from your dry cleaner (their industrial sized equipment is the only thing that can do that). But what it does provide is quality bursts of steam that will make for excellent touch-ups on garments wrinkled during travel. <br /><br />Know what you are buying and buy with confidence.
1,Why is this product even on the market?,My DA-65 never worked. The steam never worked from day 1 and the brush/lint attachment keeps falling off. This product is made in Mexico...There are other combination travel iron/steamers on the market. Make my purchasing mistake your guide. I can see from other reviews that I'm not the only one with problem. 3 thumbs down on this one.
2,They sent me a used one,"They sent me a used one, which I maybe wouldn't mind, but I paid for a new one. It's performance is about average. I e-mailed them twice about it, and they told me to send it back, but I didn't want to be out the shipping costs. I just think they should be honest about what they are selling."
2,Worked at first.......,"This product worked great at first but then after maybe a dozen uses, the steam part fizzled. It only heats now. Does not steam at all. Frustrating. Not worth the cost or time."
1,Not so great for travel.,"I purchased this steam brush product to take with me on a specific trip that involved packing a few skirts and dresses. The iron itself is a little heavier than I would have liked for traveling, and when attempting to use the product, I found that its performance was not as lickety-split as the ad promised. When at home, using my regular iron would be just as time efficient and the same amount of work. And as far as travel goes, it's not worth the extra weight."
3,Political intro hinders book,"For some unknown reason, Mr. Thomas in the 2011 edition choose to include a passage from a unpublished manuscript that his late mentor Frank Vandiver had written criticizing the Iraq War. I did not buy this book to read either man's opinion on Iraq. In future editions this passage should be deleted for it has no relevance to the subject."
2,Very dry...,"Hard to believe something as epic and frankly, exciting as the Civil War can come off this boring. From what I gather, this book was written as part of a textbook series, and it shows."
5,Great history,"A unique perspective on the history of the COnfederacy. It is a bit dated, but the primary sources used by the author provide a starting point for a thorough study of the southern perspective of the war."
5,Outstanding,Excellent book with thorough history of the C.S.A. Easy to follow in a clear and concise manner. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to learn all aspects of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
3,Very Readable Reference Book,"This is like a very long encyclopaedia article, with all the pros and cons of that. Immensely readable; you can open it at any point and reacquaint yourself with your old friends. It's when you dip into it this way that you recognize what a clever piece of condensation it is. Emory Thomas is particularly good at getting drawn-out military operations summed up in a page or two.But if you are coming to it for the first time, you will probably start from the front, and may be deeply offended. Thomas spends the introduction and first few chapters in cringing apology, acknowledging that the Confederacy was a Bad Thing. He seems awfully worried that you will hit him for daring to write a book with this title."
5,A good read!,This book is highly recommended for the student of the history of the main characters in the Third Reich. I learned a lot about the prisoners at the Nurenberg trials.
5,History as exciting as a novel,"Marrin serves up little known juicy details, and context; writing in a narrative style that retells history as a page turning epic. By far the most fun I've had reading a history book- as with favorite fiction, I was disappointed to come to its final page. A must read for adults and older children(a bit too gory for most elementary school aged) who think American History is boring."
4,The American Revolution,I believe that Albert Marrin did a wonderful job in presenting the American Revolution. This book creates a vivid picture of the war and the struggles of the individuals involved in the war.
1,"first one was missing parts, second one was broken!","The first item came in with missing parts - no faceplate and no side wings.The second one they sent me, had all the parts, but the face plate tabs that keep it attached to the pocket were broken and the faceplate would not stay attached.Extremely poor quality. Ended up returning both of them."
2,Bad Quality!,"This fits right in my Passat 2002, which is great, and it looks OK (OE looks way better tho).Yet, when I was installing it, the face plate broke off, and the tabs broke off.I ended up having to buy another one off Amazon!For $12, I guess you get what you paid for!"
1,I suggest you buy OEM,"I've bought 3 of these by now, and with this third one I learned that I should have gotten the original pocket from the start.These don't fit in and look as nice as the original pocket does, it kind of stands out, and after pushing it in the first time, forget about taking it out in one piece.No matter how carefully you are with it, the tabs or the trim piece that covers the face will snap off, and a few teeth will break off, making it impossible to put together in one piece again, so you either super glue it, tape it or come up with something special to put it in.I just got an OEM pocket from a fellow Passat owner over the internet. It fits in MUCH MUCH better, it snaps into place perfectly, and doesn't rattle or break away.In my opinion, spend the extra bucks getting the original pocket, you will not regret it.Metra makes some good items, I got their harness and antenna, but this is not one of them."
4,bo,this product helped so much made thing so much easier because it hold the radio tht is goin on top place
4,"Review by Tony Lewis-Jones, Bristol Evening Post",'Jan Oskar Hansen writes with an openness and simplicity which will refresh the most jaded of palates. His extraordinary achievement in Letters from Portugal ranks him as an important new voice in global poetry.'
3,"Tactics Ogre, Knight of Lodis","Good, fun game. Flexible storyline is a plus. However, games such as FFTA do a better job of making the user interface more accessible to new players. Tactics Ogre isn't too difficult to figure out, but not much is described to the gamer - if you've never played one of these turn-based rpg strategy games, you're kinda up a creek without a paddle."
3,This is NOT the SNES Tactics Ogre,"Just pointing out the Super Famicom version of Tactics Ogre was tranlated. It appeared on the PSX. This game is a completely different, with at least one recurring character(though you'll probably never guess who)"
1,How can I put this.............,"this game is well, sort of, BORING. The battle field is just like a checker board and the terrain is just a bunch of blocks where your characters have to jump on them to REACH the enemy then attack. There are so many menus and clicking to do before you get anything done. And then when your dont with all of that you have to choose which way you want your character to face.This is 4 sure a new BORING battle field form."
5,Best Gameboy RPG Ever!,"I have owned this game for quite some time and I also own just about every other video game system ever made. I have played through the game about eight times now. The possiblility of multiple paths as well as different endings makes this game new ever time you play it. The gameplay is involving. The character class system is wonderful. The game, while not graphicly astounding, still looks beautiful. The music is the only thing I think could be better, but it is only a minor thing. If you're looking for a great portable game to joyfully eat up hours over a long trip this is a definite, but I think this game is worth playing even over most new rpgs for the latest and greatest home systems."
4,Neat Game,"I recently bought this game for an upcoming vacation I knew I would need something to entertain myself with. This game is much harder than Golden Sun. I like the story line because it is deeper than Golden Sun. I have to say, I didnt get into the battle system and I was a little put off not being able to wander around the towns at first. This took me awhile to get used to, but when I did, it becomes highly addictive!This game is a stategy game. It really makes you think. The characters are neat, but the graphics arent as good as Golden Sun."
5,A Great strategic game,Tactics ogre is one of the best games i've had the pleasure to play. It is the kind of game that makes you want to stay up late playing. In T.O you assume the role of a knight named Alphonse(that's only the default you can make your own) a member of the felis order of the sacred flame. As you progress in the story you have to survive through countless battles in vivid multilevel battlefields. The game is supposed to have 40+ hours of gameplay but I beat it in 30. I still am working on the THREE other possible endings to the game so thats ok.this game is a great game and I STRONGLY suggest you get the game right NOW... its just that good...
5,Much needed update,was great to see a update to this great game. I can see me spending many hrs. with this new set up.
5,Axis & Allies,This game is intense and we play it for hours. Better than most video games. Great for military history buffs (or those who are not as well).
1,"STILL nothing new about the ""New Historians"".","His central thesis has been answered by everyone from Daniel Pepes and Shabtai Teveth, to Ephraim Karsh's new book ""Fabricating Israeli History"". He fabricates whole JAE speeches, mistranslates texts, and literally concocts a ""Zionist Mythology"" straw man to destroy. He fails. REad Karsh's book."
3,Acceptable watch for the price,"Works fine, easy controls.The buttons are big enough for a normal hand.Lightweight.The light doesn't illuminate as much as I expected. It's not a blue light."
2,Invest in someone else's memoirs.,"Are you addicted to Star Trek? Do you crave new Star Trek memorabilia like a man in the desert would crave for water? If so, then this book might fulfill some Freudian need. I own over 200 volumes of Star Trek novels - non-fiction and fiction, and this is one of the most disappointing ones yet. I'm not saying all Star Trek novels are great works of literary history, but at the least, they are entertaining or informative. I DID NOT FINISH THE BOOK. Star Trek is amazing because it shows a future where humanity has overcome many obstacles that face us today. Unfortunately, the authors have not overcome their petty faults with other prominent members of the Star Trek universe. This ended up being just another ""airing out of laundry"" in yet another Star Trek memoir. Do yourself a favor and buy Nimoy's ""I Am Spock."" It is entertaining, sometimes critical, but never whining"
4,A refreshingly different perspective on the Star Trek legend,"I read and thoroughly enjoyed Stephen Whitfield's book when it appeared in the late '60s, and have since read many of the cast memoirs, including Majel Barrett's adoring biography of Gene Roddenberry. The latter all started to fall into a mold -- 'I was great but under-appreciated, Star Trek was wonderful and Shatner was a louse'. This book gives a refreshingly more objective view of the whole thing, letting us see the people in a more realistic light (and one of the few books where Shatner isn't raked over the coals). Little tidbits, like the origin of the ""Great Bird of the Galaxy"", add to the fun. Yes, it drags at times, but Trek fans should find it well worth the read."
3,Star Trek From An Industry Perspective,"The original ""The Making of Star Trek"" by Stephen Whitfield provided fans with the first ""insider's look"" at the legendary series. ""Inside Star Trek"" was written by two television industry executives who were with series creator Gene Roddenberry from the beginning and throws a little mud on the rosy picture left by ""The Making of Star Trek"". ""Inside Star Trek"" has almost too much emphasis on the television industry politics - making the book a little overly technical from the average fans standpoint. Nevertheless, the above two books taken together are probably the best written history on this landmark television series."
5,The 'Inside Baseball' of Star Trek,"I couldn't put this book down. You will love this if you are curious about all the nitty-gritty political, financial and practical details that went into launching the seemingly impossible teevee series name ""Star Trek"". I was fascinated to learn about just how Desilu operated. How did Star Trek fit into the network and studio hierarchy? What was the context for creating this show virtually out of thin air? Did you know that the simple fact that the series was in color had a lot to do with its success in securing renewal, despite low ratings?""Fascinating."""
4,Almost brilliant book about ST:TOS's primetime days,We learn many things (like how the actor who played Green in the Man Trap ep was considered as a possible replacement for Leonard Nimoy as Spock). One flaw. They said Here's Lucy when they meant to say Life With Lucy in the text!
3,They may not be actors they still have big egos,Having read so many books on Star Trek I was looking forward to seeing what Herb and Bobby had to say. Herb forgot to mention that his telephone number at the time was GRADBUM and I think he showed his here. It's a bit sickening for them to take so much credit for the show and to make Gene Roddenbery look so bad. They have stolen a fair bit from other people's books. For example look at Nichelle Nichol's comment about Gene Coon's secretary Andree Richardson and then look at the comments Solow and Justman make about the same person. It's almost word for word except they make her sound a bit trashy. I'm sorry they weren't able to just take credit for what they did do but had to put others down. It's got some great facts and is a compliment to other star trek books you might have. Just don't think it's the true story.
3,Interesting But Not Much New Information,"Frankly, given all of the information that has been written about the making of this 1960's television program, I'm astounded that there hasn't been a movie-of-the-week about the making of Star Trek. The script is practically written already. This book is an interesting look behind the scenes, but there wasn't a lot more information than what's already been written elsewhere. I had a hard time believing that the 'mock dialogue' written by Justman and Solow to recount certain events from 30 years ago were true accountings of the period, rather than their own aged perspective...but hey, everybody's gotta make a buck! I was also struck by the fact that they glamorized Bill Shatner who, after everything I've read, seen and heard, seems to be an overblown bore with little appreciation for the people who made him rich."
5,"FANTASTIC READING,THE BOOK BY THE ONES WHO KNOW.","This is a MUST HAVE for any and all STAR TREK book collections since it is written by the guys who were there when things happened,and not just some fans out to make a quick buck(like some other titles show). The photos and letters help in making this a major file keeper since the best way to get the story on what really went on is to go to the men that were there.A NEED FOR ANY STAR TREK COLLECTION."
4,The Greatest Sailing Voyage Ever!,"It has been a few years since I read Joyner's Magellan. It is well researched and is a very good read. I have lent the book to several nautical buffs who also enjoyed the book very much.Of the several Magellan biographies I have read, I enjoyed this one the most.I don't think the Kirkus review folks (above) could find the Straits of Magellan on a chart!"
3,Sounds of Mariachi,"Its more like a teaser there are no real lessons in the DvD it's more to give a quick overview of the styles and a look at the different instruments role in the Mariachi. It has some cool additional documentaries about the charro suit makers, string makers, and a music store. The best part for me was the section of the disc where the Camperos play as normal."
3,10 times more expensive,"I bought this from Amazon last month for $ 1.37, now the price is $ 11.57. What an inflation !"
2,Why The High Price For Blu-Ray?,"I just bought the DVD for about $14.00 at a Wall Mart store, not knowing it was going to be available on Blu-ray. Topping off the aggravation is the high price of the Blu-ray. And one thing that should be considered is there seems to be some sort of technical problem with the picture (at least on the DVD version) as there are frequent jumps where it seems to skip a frame or so. I've seen this often when watching reruns of TV shows, but never before on a DVD. Does the Blu-ray have the same problems?"
3,It's OK,"Big fan of the Home album, know all lyrics by heart. Saw another DVD years ago from or by the Dixie Chicks and liked it. Did not pay attention to the ramble if there was one going on. So I bought this DVD hoping to relive that experience. I either paid no attention to the prior one or it was edited, but the ""talking"" between songs turned me off big time. Singing is what they should stick too."
4,Very sturdy adjustable cabinet,"It doesn't include the glass front panel in the picture, but it is a very sturdy solid wood stereo cabinet with two adjustable shelves. Looks/feels very nice assembled."
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"There is NO glass front for this item! A glass front will cost another $60 dollars.It is true that the description does not mention a glass front, in the same way it does not mentionthat you have to assemble it. It's heavy and sturdy as described, but don't allow yourself to be misled.The instructions are photocopied and the details are not clear in all cases.Amazon does not sell the optional glass door.The company also lists optional wooden legs for $20.The unit IS equipped with the casters pictured.Think beyond the photo.Ok, how many stars should I give it?"
2,So much more could have been done!,"Yeah, while I realize this was just a story about his final months of life, it's still so frustrating. This man was a rock n roll icon! I would have liked to have seen how and why he got into the music business, how he met Mick and Keith, how they picked the name, etc. as well as actual clips of when he was in the band. All I got from this movie is that Brian was a selfish, stoned, womanizer! BORING!"
2,Could of been better...,"It was really confusing for me because some of the flashbacks didn't make since in that particular time in that particular scene. Also I didnt get the reason if frank drowned brian by accident or on purpose and if in fact why did he do this. I've been told that the hallucinogen LSD, makes you see demons and monsters and at one time ur totally happy but then it only last for a short amount of time until the extreme anger kicks in and ur very strong too. So maybe that's why it made Brian tick i guess. Because the movie, it made it seem like Brians life was totally fine before met Anita. It seemed like destruction at first site rather than love at first site. I just don't know but to me, the movie had an amazing plot, but should of explained it more..."
1,Disconnected,"I never felt so disconnected in all of my life in watching a movie. About 20 mins into the film I was like, well, I cannot wait to sell this one on Amazon! It is not a keeper, it is a renter.I thought the guy who played Jones was incredible and looked the part. The other people I really did not know who they were. Tom? Janet? There was no explanation of who they were, so unless you are an early Stones protege, you won't know who they are either.I did gain a bit of insight into how Brian was as a person and why he was fired from the Stones, but that was it. This could have been told in about 15 mins. The rest of the time was someone's drug induced fairtytale."
2,I Felt Nothing,"I felt nothing at the point in the film when Brian Jones sank to the bottom of the pool, dead. Did anyone else care? Are we supposed to feel nothing when a twenty-seven year old man dies like that, murdered or not? Something is wrong, if so. Was Brian Jones' death just an excuse to make a movie about the sixties?"
3,Someone got away with murder!,"Boy! After over 35 years, people are still thinking about Brian Jones! Lots of people! That says something! But what really bothers me is that someone may have gotten away with murder! Brian Jones did have some problems but he deserved to live his life just like everyone else! I think it's appauling that that loser carpenter may have killed Brian Jones and walked away scott free. And like a coward when he knows he won't be punished he makes a death bed confession!"
3,Not a bad movie,"If you like the Rolling Stones, you may like this movie. It is not about the Rolling Stones, it is about Brian Jones and his abilities, his drug use and his 'fall from grace,' due to that drug use. All I had heard was that he had drowned in his pool. This movie presents one of at least three theories about what happened, what appears to be the most plausible, although there were no witnesses and no theories were ever proven. Briann Jones' loss to drugs, and to the music world, truly was a tragic loss."
1,Wake Up and Smell The Coffee,"I can't believe I wasted 102 minutes of my life watching this fictional account of Brian Jones's last day. Let me get this straight - some guy named Frank Thorogood murders Brian in his own pool. Brian's ""girlfriend"" is then forced to keep her mouth shut about it or she may end up at the bottom of the pool too. Yeah....right! The same people who believe this fiction also believe in Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny.I guess I would have an easier time believing this story if was written by a third party who did not have any connection to the Stones or Brian Jones. Let the man rest in peace."
5,Cool Story About The Last Days of Brian Jones,"Very interesting movie...don't know how factually accurate it is, but it's a very well acted movie and does bring up some questions about the late Brian Jones' passing."
4,Good value.,"Well, these are definitely the lowest price ratcheting wrenches that I could find. I've been wanting a set for years now, and now I finally have one.These wrenches are not the best in terms of construction, however, they are quite strong. They are also quite effective. I would have liked to know what sizes come in this set, but they were not listed here. So, here they are:1/4"" + 5/16""3/8"" + 7/16""1/2"" + 9/16""5/8"" + 3/4""11/16"" + 7/8""These wrenches are simple enough to operate, and low cost enough to not worry about losing them.I have a mechanic friend who tends to borrow tools without remembering to return them. At this price, I might just purchase a set for him.In short, I'd definitely recommend these for someone who doesn't own a set. Just keep in mind, these are far from Craftsman quality."
4,Nice wrenches!,I have used my new ratchet box-end wrenches a few times now and i really like them. The offset keeps the knuckles from being scraped and the direction lever is very easy to flip. Nice wrenches.
3,Not as good as the JLC Field Guides,"This Best Practices Guide is a good reference book, but I think it pales in comparison to the two volume reference put out by the Journal of Light Construction, the JLC Field Guide to Residential Construction (Volumes 1 & 2). THe JLC guides have a much more uniform and cohesive format and illustration/graphic style.I have all three guides, and find myself using the JLC guides far more often in my residential remodel design practice."
2,Kindle Edition images or poor quality,"This review is for the kindle version only. This is an excellent book, but the kindle edition has such poor quality images (can't read the text in the detail drawings!) that it leaves me wishing I bought the paper version. Amazon should suppress the kindle edition until the publisher fixes this."
3,stick broom,this was not the one i really wanted but it worked til i got the one i did want. these are the greatest little brooms. work better then a big vaccum by far. eureka has the one with the floor or carpet. it has a brush in it. these are the best ones to get.
4,"Does this unit ""suck"" or not..??","This little vacuum does a good job at what it was intended to do; light , yet powerful and good ""suck""...the brushroller works well, too, at getting at stuff, particularly over irregular terrain, such as a carpet; the fatal flaw will ultimately turn out to be the poorly designed handle as this is what failed on the FIRST one that I still use...."
3,"Does what we need it to do, but little else.","We got this for a small apartment. It is nice and small and fairly powerful. It has a hard time with the edges of the carpet. Also it looks as though the bottom floor piece can come off to allow just a dust buster style, but it does not on this model at least."
3,This vacume has a very short cord!,"Unless you want to keep replugging the vacume like 4 times to do one room, I wouldn't recommend this vacume. I am sending it back to Target."
4,Handy little vacuum,"Having owned several other small vacuums for our laminate floors and as the owner of two indoor only cats, I have to say this is the best yet. In fact, I have ordered two spares, just in case they stop making them!!!!!! There are two minor features that could be improved upon. The first is that emptying the cup is messy as you have to scrape the pet hair off with your hand. It is, however, easy to rinse off and is like new again. The second is that the little motor is quite loud. It's also quite good for a quick crumb pick-up on carpeting but is not meant to take the place of a regular upright for heavy vacuuming."
4,Good for apartments!,"I bought this to keep my apartment tidy. I have tile floors and some carpeting - but nothing thick.This works great. It's a little noisy but quieter than others I have used. It doesn't take up much room to store, and emptying it is pretty easy.The only downside is sometimes it is hard to get the detachable pocket for dirt to snap back in. But nothing too damning."
1,Belt Wouldn't Stay On!,"This is garbage! The first two weeks were great, I bought it for my children to use because of the size. Then the belt that turns the brush started coming off(?)- wouldn't stay on. I finally gave up and am now looking for a replacement."
5,Wonderful Vacuum!!!,"I purchased this vac about 2 months ago. I absolutely love it! I had an older model,but it got lost when we moved. It also worked great which is why I purchased another.I have vinyl flooring throughout my entire house and I have no problems sucking up dirt and pet hair and whatever else my 5 year old seems to drop.The cord is very long and it is lightweight. Even my 5 year old likes to use it!I would hightly recommend this product to anyone.It is definitley a great vac at a great price!"
4,Good for quick cleanups...,"I bought this last year when we were putting our house up for sale and I needed to make the house look ""perfect"" every time we went out. It was great for doing a quick clean up on the carpets, vinyl and stairs. In our new house I still use it on the stairs and for quick clean ups when I don't feel like lugging out the big vacuum. It won't replace your regular vacuum, but for making the place look good when you don't have the time for a full cleaning, it does the job quite nicely!"
2,Good for wood floors,"This vacuum got the job done on my wood floors, but couldn't pick up anything from my carpet. If you have more than an area rug, this is not the vacuum you want."
3,"Works great, but too LOUD!","This review is for the 169D, which is not listed on Amazon. Seems basically the same vacuum as the 169B though. I bought a corded stick vacuum, as I wanted more power and didn't want to worry about the battery running down. The Eureka 169D is one of the few corded models. This vacuum is very affordable and easy to use. I was surprised by the suction. Worked super on my hardwood floors and doormats. But, holy cow, it is so LOUD that I can't bear to use it. And not just loud but very high pitched. I'm not usually sensitive to noise and am not bothered by either of my other vacuums. Not many people mentioned the noise in their reviews so I'm wondering if my model is defective. If you can stand to use it, it is a great little vacuum for hard surfaces. Especially for the price. Sadly, I'm going to have to return mine and find something I can run without wearing hearing protection."
4,easy to use,"it's a very easy using stuff. Without the help of my husband, I can put it together and clean it after using. Clean quite well for my small apartment. I love it! Except it's a little bit heavy for one hand, still needs two hands all the time which is a little bit inconvinient when u need to move a chair or sth. But good over all."
5,Lightweight powerhouse,Works as described.. Lightweight and powerful. I clean the filter with a leaf blower! Easy to operate. I hope it lasts.
3,Works well; handle falls off.,"I just received this today and tested it out. And it works pretty well, both on the shallow carpet in my bedroom and the tile floor in my kitchen.My only complaint is that the ""lock"" that's supposed to keep the handle in place doesn't lock it in properly. The handle will just slide right off when I'm vacuuming if I'm not careful or if I don't wrap the cord around it to hold it in. I probably just got a defective item, which is annoying, of course, but the work-around is easy enough that I'm not going to bother sending it back. Anyway, considering the price, this little guy definitely lives up to my expectations."
4,My eureka,I liked this vacuum cleaner because it is very handy and not heavy which is important to me. For people who have back problems it is too easy to use this for cleaning. Another point which is so good it dosn't need to be charged. So you can put that in the closet when you don't need it. And the color is pretty too.
2,Won't keep up with my toddler's messes,"I needed this stick vac to quickly clean up the constant trail of cheerios, dried up rice and noodles under the dining room table, and the sand and yard debris that is gets tracked across my linoleum floor. It just can't handle it. The base doen't sit up high enough off the floor to get over cheerios, it just pushes them around. Rice usually flies goes in and flies right out again. After I'm finished vacuuming sand I can still feel it on my feet as I walk over the area. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does great at picking up cat hair, and for vacuuming the small area rugs I have in front of my doors. It's also just a flick of the button to switch between hard floor and carpet cleaning. The filter is easy to remove and it rinses clean in warm water, although it can be a bit tricky to get it back in to the vacuum."
1,Disappointment,"We've bought this vacuum when rented our first apartment, that had wall-to-wall carpeting. We used to have a small vacuum cleaner in Europe and it worked just fine. But this one turned out to be just a waste of money. It could barely pick up some easily visible dirt on the surface and now, after just several months, it almost doesn't vacuum at all (even though we clean it all the time) and we're looking for a _real_ vacuum cleaner. We probably won't even keep it for a quick clean-up, since it's not very handy either."
3,Product not as described,"Gave this item as a gift. Wanted a vacuum with a telescopic handle which the description says this item has. It does not. The handle is a fixed length. The vacuum works fine and does the job it was designed for. Looking at it makes me question how long it will last if used heavily. If the description were accurate, we would not have purchased it. So, if a telescoping handle is important to you, skip this vacuum."
3,Good for wood floors and light clean up,"For hardwood floors, it does a good job. On carpet it'll clean up light spills and it's convenient on stairs. For what it costs, and without the expectation that it will do the same as a ""regular"" vacuum cleaner, it serves its purpose well. To me, it's basically a Dustbuster with a motorized brush. I think the Dustbuster ""Dirtbuster"" vacuum is better and has a stronger vacuum, although the Dustbuster doesn't have the motorized head."
1,Poor durability,"I had used this stick vacuum for small jobs in the kitchen and it was fine (5 minutes or so). On the last occasion I used it for an extended period of maybe 30 minutes around the house. After that it stopped working. These units are simply too inexpensive to have repaired so I threw it away. However, they are not so inexpensive as to be disposable."
3,Eureka Easy Clean 2 in 1 Lightweight 169B,"This is an okay vacuum for the estimated $20 price mark. I do not recommend this for everyday use. There is plenty of suction power. However, the filter and dust compartments are small, which means suction is lost with dust collection. In a 3BR 2BA townhouse, this vacuum needs to be emptied out after two rooms. The vacuum's slim profile makes it easy to get under furniture. The broad head however makes it hard to get behind furniture and around corners."
3,cordless vac with a cord,I did get around to return it in time It wasn't what I wanted ordered what I thought was a coredless vac and what I got was a corded one I plan on giving it as a Chrstmas gift to one of my daughters.
1,Really Does not Work,"The suction on this Vacuum is very slight. Much better ""Light Weight"" Vacs out there. Return the unit immediately for a refund."
2,Cheap is Cheap,"The cord on this vacuum is too short to finish even one room. The bagless cup is too small, I had to empty it 3 times for the two rooms I vacuumed. It does pick up okay and works on short pile carpet. I have dogs and I would not recomend this vacuum to other dog owners."
3,Works well but handheld mode is flawed,"Like many of the other reviewers have stated, this is a great vacuum. It's able to efficiently and quickly clean my hardwood floors.However, I bought this vacuum expecting to be able to use it in the handheld mode to vacuum my sofa. The problem with this mode is the wide opening cannot be detached. This opening gets rolled around all over my floor so it has dirt and hairs stuck on it. There is no way I'm going to roll this same opening over my sofa. It would be usable if this wide opening can be detached and a smaller opening can be used for vacuuming things besides the floor."
5,love this vac,"This is the perfect vac for quick touchup cleanings, especially for non-carpeted areas. But it works on carpets as well.It is lightweight so very easy to use. This is actually my second one, first was purchased in 2000 for my sons dorm roomand it is still going strong and in use in his shop. Love this vac and highly recommend it, best $30 I've ever spent!"
2,Eh.,"Granted, this vacuum is very cute and light, but it did NOT suck up dirt in my carpet very well at all. I had to go over and over the same spot and it still did not pick up simple little specks. My dust buster worked better than this! I would not recommend this as a regular vacuum cleaner...perhaps as a 'trophy vacuum,' as it's cute and all, but really--I don't need a vacuum cleaner as a decoration. I need it to work."
2,Not at all good for Carpet Cleaning,"I have been using only this vacuum in my condo for over a year now. I have been too poor, up until now, to get anything else so this is what I have had to live with. I feel that by now, I have a very fair opinion of what it can do. This vacuum works well for hard floors. It is light and small and easy to store. However, I have two cats and mainly carpet floors. I have never spent less than an hour on my living room carpet alone. I have to go over and over it, and at the end, I don't even have a completely clean carpet. I have never been completely cat hair free in this condo because of the poor carpet cleaning quality of this vacuum. Cleaning the filter is a really messy process too. Like I said, it does my hard kitchen and bathroom floor great. It does not do anything for my carpet--hence, I am searching for a new vacuum right now."
2,Not Cordless - Cord too short,"When I searched for ""cordless"" vacuum, this was one of the selections. I read the reviews and so on, but managed to miss that this is a corded appliance. When I got it I decides to try it out and not send it back; is was in expensive.After using it, I'm going to give it away and order a real cordless unit. (Win-Win for Amazon) The cord is to short for any meaningful use and it gets in the way. If you want a vacuum that you can grab and take to any place in the house and pick up a spill or dirt spot, get a cordless.As a corded vacuum, it works pretty well considering the above."
5,Might little guy,"This is a great little vacuum. It just vacuums its little heart out. I have used it for close to a year, several times a week, to vacuum ceramic tiles, carport and patio, as well as area rugs. Does exactly what it should do and does not show any signs of slowing down. Great little vac for the price."
2,Be Serious,"I think people are deluding themselves, or trying to over-intellectualize what was going on with this collaboration in order to arrive at an erroneous praiseworthiness for the music's merits. Hogwash. This stuff is painful to listen to. I cringed and winced to hear the juxtaposition of the choir singing hymns over jazz music. It doesn't fit. It grates upon the senses. I will gladly take one or the other, but not both together. It's like peanut butter and pickles - I love both, but sheesh, do not let them touch."
2,"Crutches are ok, but 12"" shorter than advertised","My son broke his leg at a playground, and his leg was put in a cast from his toes to his thigh, and we needed some crutches so he could get around. We purchased these, noting that the first reviewer said the crutches were too short for her 4'1"" child -- this was perfect for us, because our son is only 3'6"". The crutches are great, and work well for him. They are sturdy overall, but the wing nut holding the hand rest snapped off after only 2 weeks, and left a spot that was sharp that he cut himself on. The distance from the armpit to the hand rest is indeed too short, but not so short that it is unusable. The product photo shown is not the actual child crutches -- they are the same materials and colors, but the proportions are different. The crutch is advertised as fitting kids 4'2"" to 4'8"", but that is a full foot too tall -- the crutches actually fit a child 3'2"" to 3'8"". If your child is within this range, it is a fine pair of crutches to buy."
3,Old Electronics. Don't waist the money,"This would have been good back in 2000, but today you can find something much more appealing for the money. Don't buy."
4,Educated View,"I read this book to have a look at the insights of a man, who personally as a soldier has had to deal with the after shocks of terrorism, and as a leader of a nation that has to deal with it every day. I don't wish to pass comment on those who have also reviewed this book before me, as they live in Israel and I don't. I am aware of Mr Netanyahu's background as well as that of his successor Mr Barak. And I feel that both will continue to hold the ideals of counterterrorism that both have experienced, partly explained in this book."
1,I can't really believe someone thinks this way,"This book was used for a college course I took, and I was completely appalled at the sheer idiocy of it. It doesn't present a balanced point of view at all, although I suppose it's to be expected considering who the author is."
3,goat health hand book,"This publication has some useful information but some of the information is dated. There is detailed information on how to deal with a prolapse yourself if a vet is not available ,as well as injection and parasite info. There is a detailed description of diseases with treatment. This is not my favorite goat book but it is worth adding to your library."
2,"Cute, but that's about it","That's right-- it's cute to look at for a little boy, which is why we put it on our registry. Well, our son has been using it since about 4.5 months. Not much fun as a stationary entertainer-- not enough for baby to do, and many of the toys are repetitive. So, we thought, maybe better once he gets mobile? No, not any better at all. Still kind of boring, rough plastic edges (scratch your child and your hardwood floors), and forget about rolling on carpet at all-- that requires monumental effort, even from an adult. The stationary ""jump"" setting is also a joke; we own a FP Jumperoo and when we put my son in here to jump, I kid you not, he looked at us like ""you have got to be kidding me."" Given all these factors, I think there are much better walkers/activity centers on the market-- buy something else. For the price, this walker/entertainer is a very poor value."
2,There are better toys out there,"This thing sucks. It's easy to put together and looks cool. My baby was in it for about 20mins and spit up and the whole thing stopped working. Now since the the horn and lights don't work it is just used as a place to set the babies when I need them to be still. They do like to pull up on it and play. They are not to the walking stage yet but from what I can tell, even when they are they won't be able to push this thing unless they are on the tile and that is a hazard in itself. I wouldn't recommend it, find something else less expensive."
4,Walker,"The walker was very cute when i finally got it from UPS after them giving the worst service ever. First they said it was attempted to be delivered and nobody was there which was a baldfaced lie because my mom sat home all day waiting for it and its not like she lives in a mansion and didn't hear the door. Plus even if they did go to the door, there was no sticker left that they attempted.. so i had to deal with the unprofessionalism and dishonesty of UPS for a week before i finally got the package. I attempted to contact the seller because amazon said they couldn't do anything due to it being 3rd party seller so they told me to submit this form to the seller so they can contact UPS to get my package to me but the seller NEVER responded to my inquiry so i had to drive out of my way to the UPS store to get the package. So with all that said, i will not be using Amazon and their 3rd party sellers EVER AGAIN! But my niece loves the walker.. next time i'll just go to Babies R us to save hassle."
2,"Looks Awesome, but is it safe???","So, I'm the Mom who has 3 strollers, 3 car seats, the best of the best. I LOVED this walker when I saw it the first time. Upon putting it together for my 8 month old, who is almost 20lbs.. I thought, Wow...this is super cute,,but the plastic seems so cheap!!! Well, I broke 2 of the parts putting it together..(these cheap little plastic tabs) and my son bounced out of it within the first 15 minutes in it.... and it fell apart... Maybe I put it together bad?, but I am usually pretty [...]. ?? So, as much as I love it because it looks cute, I returned it..for a normal looking walker..that I know will be safe for my son."
3,Not Too bad,"My son, 61/2 month, stuck his right hand inside the handle; he cried and we found out that his hand is between the car and it right handle. So, we have to break the handle to take out his hand. We love the product very much, if the handle is easy to replace, it will be better."
1,Combi has Poor Customer Service,"It was cute BUT!!!My Daughter of 6 months broke off the hornI tried to talk with Combi several of times and left voice messages.I was on hold for 23 minutes and then rudely sent to voice mailThey are not fixing the walker, it was only used for 2 weeks and now I am out of the money and stuck with a broken product.Not Quality!!!"
1,Cool Car! Bad Walker!,"The car shape was very appealing. However, the quality of the clips that hook the cloth seat to the walker base is not good. They are made from a very thin plastic. The walker that I received came already with one of the clips completely snapped in half; another was halfway ripped off. As far as the performance, I was not able to see how the walker worked. Without the seat, I couldn't use it."
2,"Ok walker, iffy bouncer","This was a little disappointing of a purchase, my daughter did like the walker although it is a little bulky and too heavy for her to get around in as well as the bounce feature is not much of a bounce.We used it maybe 4 times tops, we for sure wouldn't recommend this product for someone.If you're trusting in Walkers, and have a safe enough environment for them, try a lighter weight one with less bulk.Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.Thanks for reading!"
3,Picture not entirely accurate... but Combi made it right!,"Length:: 0:42 MinsI love, love, LOVE this item. HOWEVER... I received 2 side mirrors and no horn. Every picture I've seen of this item has the horn in it so I never thought to specifically ask for a horn. Inside the box was a happy little insert that said ""if you receive 2 side mirrors, here's how to install them"". Right Start said sometimes you get one of each, sometimes you get 2 of one. Just doesn't seem like a good way to do business. I have left a message with Combi but from the reviews I've seen here I'll probably not hold my breath waiting for a response.I am also a little worried that it won't last long, the plastic seems a little cheap and babies can be brutal on toys.We'll see."
1,quality less than expected,"This is adoraable to look at, but does not have many activities for babies under 12 months. And we had only used it a few times when the steering wheel sounds and music quit working. Cute but overpriced.Peggy Indianapolis"
3,Combi Activity Walker Mint,"Great all in one combo item, this item takes care of four other play center for children. A must have for new families with limited space. Easy to put together not that many pieces and just a great walker, my nephew is the only one around his area that has one like it."
3,"Cute, but concerns...","My daughter is currently about 14 pounds. I first put her in this at 10 pounds, holding her up, and the plastic tabs holding the seat in broke off! I called Combi, and they were very nice. All I needed to give them was the lot number, date of manufacture, and model number and I had a new seat in two days, BUT now I'm a little leary of leaving her in the seat without being right there on top of her with my arms right at her side in case it breaks again. I doubt she'd seriously injure herself if it did break, but still...It was a gift, so we can't return it now that Babies R Us has their ridiculous receipt or no return policy."
2,Adorable but didn't hold up for an 10 month old...,We bought this walker and loved it until the baby actually started pushing it around. The top snapped off the base on one side and is completely unusable. I was hoping to pass this down to the next child...
2,Not too bad...looks good...,"I wanted it the first time I saw it, but accidentally ordered the wrong color. It's nice, but a bit heavy and my son seems to be too long for the maximum height. He likes it because he can move from one place to another, but he needs more entertainment. The mirror doesn't move towards him and the horn is too tough for a baby to to squeeze. It's a bunch of hype, but glad I ordered the wrong color, the cooler one is way too expensive."
1,scratched my little girls legs,"I LOVED THIS WALKER FOR MY LITTLE GIRL, AND SHE LOVED IT TO. EVERY TIME WE GOT HER OUT OF IT SHE STARTED SCREAMING AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY UNTIL WE LOOKED AT HER LEGS AND THEY HAD LONG SCRATCHES ON THEM. WE LOOKED UNDERNEATH AND IT HAD TABS STICKING OUT THAT WERE HURTING HER. MAYBE WE JUST GOT A DEFECTIVE ONE. JUST BE SURE IF YOU BUY ONE LOOK UNDERNEATH. SO WERE GONNA STICK TO A WALMART ONE LIKE WE GOT OUR SON."
3,be aware of the short life span!,"This is rated at 6 months, but no larger than 25 pounds. I think that is a pretty short life span for a toy that costs a hundred bucks! As a bouncer, there are many better out there - it only goes straight up and down (no motion forward and back), and the way it fastens together (fairly easy to pull apart) I don't feel comfortable letting my 9 month old use it for that. Within ten minutes, my son had removed the windshield (maybe he was chopping the top on this hot rod?). This item is really cute, and I splurged because we have a hot rod that looks similar, so it will make for some cute photos, but it's not durable or flexible enough for regular use. I wish I would have just gotten him a pedal car instead."
3,I didn't buy this item,"I saw this in a store and was convinced I had to have it for my 6 month old son. I brought my husband and son to the store to check it out. We did not purchase for the following reasons1. small wheels, didn't look like it would handle rolling on carpet well2. smll seat, my son is 50 percentile weight and 90 percentile height, the seat does not adjust back and he just fit, and his feetjust touched the ground with his toes, we wondered if by the time his feet were fully on the ground would he still fit in the seat?3. Other walkers are $30-$50, this just wasn't special enough to justify the high priceNow we loved the look, quality seemed good, when we put our son in the display one he immediately grabbed for the toys, so if you have hard floors and a small baby it would be a great toy"
4,History and reenacting together,"There are great color pictures of utility and wear of the gear. This book is best to buy together with the book : ""G.I. COLLECTORS GUIDE: Army Service Forces Catalog: US Army European Theater of Operations""."
4,GI in WWII,"Interesting book, completely illustrated, good reenacting photographs; I think it's a well done guide for USA WWII militaria collectors and reenactors."
2,Great efforts but lack reality,"I was not expecting this book to be a Sunday afternoon photo shoot for reanactors. It lacks reality and substance.I returned this book out of disapointment.Seeing the same faces in every picture but in diffrent uniforms takes a lot away from this book. However, the color photos were nice. Better luck next time but a A for effort."
3,Just couldn't get into it,"I love adventure games and I must admit it's been a few years since I tried this one, but I just really didn't understand it. Maybe I'm just not good enough for it or something, but I just couldn't get into it. I found that I wasn't really progressing in many ways, so I couldn't really get into it. Try one of the Monkey Island games by Lucas Arts instead. Or, if you really like Titanic adventure games, try that one by Cyberflix- Titanic: Adventure Out of Time. Now THAT'S a good Titanic game."
5,Absolutely THE BEST,"After reading another review of this coffee I gave it a try. Now I won't ever buy another coffee from anywhere else. It is worth every penny! I have bought other Kona coffees from gourmet stores, wholesale stores and suppliers but this one tops them all. Excellent flavor every time."
5,Into the wild blue yonder!,This simple kite is fast to get flying in little wind and packs up easily for transport. The supplied string is good enough for beginners but you may need to upgrade to better/longer string if you want to fly higher.
1,Broken piece and horrible service from City Living Stores,"I can't say how good this thing performs, but the piece we got shipped from City Living Stores was broken (could not be assembled into a workable cart). To top that the customer service at City Living was horrible and had to keep calling for a week to have them take the return. Just watch out for that!"
1,Very disappointing,"The instructions were hard to figure out, like it was translated from another language. After using it five minutes, a big wheel fell off and all the associated hardware bounced off to disappear into the dark corners of a public garage.When I called Amazon, who is the vendor, if you buy it from Target on the Amazon site, they could only offer a postal sticker, not a UPS one. They couldn't just send replacement hardware. They will send another cart, but I have to pack up the old one and take time off from work to lug it to the post office. I wouldn't have to do this if they would use UPS.I am very disappointed in Amazon. It was very hard to hear the customer service person with all the noise in the background.I am going to stop buying from Amazon the way that I have been.A big waste of time. Don't buy it. If you buy a cart, get it through them from a different vendor. Maybe they will be more helpful than Amazon was."
5,One for me and one for my daughter,She also had some difficulty putting it together but also got the job done. The cart helps her get stuff up to her apartment more easily.
5,"Love My Little Red 'Wagon!""",Just moved to a retirement community & am the star w/ the only red cart in sight! Pretty and practical. Don't know how easy or hard it was to put together because I had one of our maintenance men do it for me! Only things I'd add would be: adjustable handle and wheels that swivel. But it's perfectly usable as is. Little heavier than I expected but can still get it in and out of my car trunk easily (so far!)
1,Not so durable,I bought this to help my grandmother tote her groceries from the car to her apartment. The rear wheel broke after a trip hauling a few groceries.
2,Missing Piece,"I purchased this for my nephew. It arrived in a timely manner. It's exactly what he wanted, but a piece was missing. My sister-in-law is going to contact the company."
2,Can't Stop Filler Tube From Leaking,"What attracted me to this Battery Filler Bulb was the low price. Bad decision. I should have know that when the shipping cost is more than the price of the product, the product may not work.The Filler Bulb looks good and is well packaged. However, you cannot stop the tube from leaking when you move the bulb from cell to cell. It makes a mess -water all over the to of the battery, the floor, everywhere."
5,Really enjoyed it.,"I had to read Mary and Matilda for class but I really enjoyed both stories. I didn't have time to read Maria, so I cannot comment on them. It's not a hard read and it's really easy to understand. Mary is semi-hard to follow because she uses ""she"" and ""he"" a lot even though she talks about two ""shes"" at the same time, so it's slightly confusing. I loved the book regardless."
5,Chilton's Manuals are the best,As always this the best home maintainence manual that a shade-tree could find. Every step is correct and explicit. They make no assumptions that the reader has performed these task before or that they are a mechanic by train. Could not ask for anything better
4,above average bar none,"If you need an easy-to-install, attractive wall-mounted kitchen gadget rack,that holds 4-5 items, this is your product.Price and shipping were fine too."
1,Product separated after 2 months,"The product normally is very good which I used having bought it in Spain, however, the product I received here separated after less than 2 months! It is unusable now. It is either extremely old, been kept in extreme climates or is simply not the same product. Whatever the case- it was a total waste of money."
4,This game rocks!!!,"This game is really cool! I love making robots! In this game you don't really build the robots, but you can customize them with different colors and body designs. The battles are fun but need little strategy. The action can get a little frantic. The atributes of the robopon are a lot more complicated than Pokemon types. I wouldn't recomend this for really young players. If you like RPGs and customize - your- team games get this!!"
5,Just what I needed,"I have been using thread baren cotton mop covers for months, and decided it was time to get some new ones. This product saves time and EFFORT when cleaning wood floors. Now that I have new mop covers I put less effort into pushing the mop around, and get better coverage. Thank you for having exactly what you offered and great quality too!"
3,Not the greatest.,"This mop isn't what I'd hoped it would be. It's got a very large surface and it's very difficult to clean edges and corners. Overall, it doesn't do a great job of cleaning and I find it hard to use. If I were you, I'd try something else before buying this."
3,Pricey gloves,"These are very nice gloves for shooting, reloading, and handling things in the blind. Suprisingly warm for such a thin glove. Biggest complaint is the price and that the wind seems to cut right through these."
1,Seam came apart,"I had the gloves about a week and the seams came apart on both thumbs. I was going to contack Under Armer but I figured I would have to send them back, I needed them so I just sewed them up myself. I dont think Ill be buying any UA stuff any more"
3,Haven't noticed a difference.,"I have worn these under my gloves in 30-40 degrees and have not been able to tell the difference without them. They make a nice lightweight glove for turkey hunting though. A bit overpriced for that though. Also, I got a rip in one hand within a month of using."
5,It works,The result is noticeable after one week of use. It simply reverse the color of my coffee-coated teeth.
4,great whitener at home,"the reason I gave it 4 stars because I like Crest premium whitennig system better. It's more money, but it works much faster!Easy to use and really works."
2,Didn't like it-,"I bought these a while back ago, I didn't like the results. I don't think they really work, they have a satisfactory guarantee, or your money back. I wasn't motivated to get my money back, only once I felt a stinging sensation, that was after I brushed my teeth ""not recommended"" yeah it says not to brush your teeth before you use this product. I did anyways and that's the only time I ever felt any stinging sensation. The product didn't do it's job, I don't think I'll buy anything from crest again related to whiting. I should have saved up my money and got my moneys worth, I'd advise you do the same. Just save a bit, to get better results else where."
2,No difference in teeth color,"After using this product continously for 14 days, I did not see any difference in color of my teeth. $25 down the drain."
3,Talk about problems,"After my braces were removed i noticed that my teeth were really disclolored. I decided to try the strips to see if they worked. After a few days, and some problems with the strips, i noticed my teeth started to look a little whiter. Then i noticed that my teeth started to ache, just like when i had braces on. I read the instruction which said that sensitivity was common and that it would go away, so i kept using the strips. However, after a few more days i couldn't stand the pain in my teeth, i couldnt eat or drink and i would wake up in the middle of the night in tears because my teeth hurt so bad. I quit using them and it took almost a week for me to be able to eat and drink normally again. After all the problems with the strips and the pain my teeth really are not significantly whiter, i think it was a waste of time."
5,It works!,"This really works! After using this product, my dentist commented on how white my teeth were. It's very convenient, I can just throw one on while I'm cleaning and I can still talk on the phone.The cons:*can make teeth sensitive to hot and cold for a couple of days*it doesn't taste very good*can be hard to keep on teeth sometimesOverall, I love it! It lasts for a long time too!"
3,:/,"today was my third day using them...the first day was not bad. the second day i started feeling pain, and today OH GOD!!! its horrible. i feel like crying from how much my teeth and gums hurt! today when i put on my second round of strips, i felt REALLY BAD pain in my lower gum like almost a burning sensation, and very irritating...so i moved the strips around and moved them off that spot...i was still in great pain. when my 30 minutes were over i noticed that the spot on my gums where i felt a burning sensation, the whitening gel indeed did burn off that spot on my gum and i was bleeding. now im experiencing the worst pain EVER!! :[ im going to the dentist tomorrow because im scared of what it did to my gums and teeth after only 3 days!"
2,OOOOWWWEEEEE!!!!!,"my teeth hurt so bad after i used this stuff. i couldn't even finish using the whole thing, the searing tooth pain was awful!!!! it was horrible pain i never want to feel again. and my teeth were only a tiny bit whiter, if anything. actually they might not have been whiter at all, i think i imagined it. might work for some people w/out a problem but if you have sensitive teeth, cavities or gum disease expect some PAIN. the peroxide really gets in there & chews up the nerves. ouch!"
5,"Works really well, my teeth are whiter","bottom line it works, use it like directed and your teeth will be a couple of shades whiter"
3,ouch :_(,"as directed, i used the whitestrips twice a day.i started on a saturday. at first it was tingly,and didnt hurt much, i didnt even classify it as pain.anyway on the third day, tuesday night, i noticedi couldnt brush my upper gums anymore coz they hurt.looking closer...they kinda darkened, or somehowmy gums sort of were swollen and a bit red, i cant describe it,its not obvious from 3 feet away but looking really closeyou will notice it.it depends on your pain threshold. i never really thought of 'no pain no glory' until i tried this expensive thingy."
4,this works,This product definitely whitens teeth. The only problem I have is that is makes me drool and the strips are no long enough.
3,A far better alternative is available.,"When I used these strips, I found that they were too flimsy, and therefore tended to bend back over themselves, making them difficult to apply. After they were applied to the teeth, they did not always stay in place and tended to slide around. Also, it is inconvenient to have to remove the strips, when they have done their work. For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative. A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc. These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don't stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard. On size strip (larger than Crest's) fits both upper and lower teeth. The active ingredients are the same as Crest, but the cost is about half the cost of Crest. Superior to Crest in every way."
5,Review of Crest Whitestripes,"Crest Whitestrips are easy and convenient to use. I use them approximately once a week, and they help to keep my teeth a natural white color. I don't personally like my teeth to be too white, so I'm happy with the results that the strips provide."
5,This really works,I used it for a week my teeth were so beautiful. but you have to make sure to brush your teeth though. you cant use these just alone. they are wonderful!
2,Eh....,"If your expecting barbie white teeth with this product forget it. I'd say this product is for someone with already semi-white teeth who wants them to be even whiter. If your starting with less than white teeth like most of us are i'd recommend something much stronger. As for the application process, they where very easy to apply and i could carry on with my day as normal with them on. You'll experience a little sensitivity but nothing worth even mentioning. Overall, i'm not very impressed but they do have a return policy which is nice."
4,White and sensitive,"I have been using these strips for the last two weeks, the first week was fine and I did see results within that time. I am in a bit of pain, though. It's December and the cold weather is killing my teeth. I thought I would have no problem with sensitivity as I have never experienced such a problem eating cold and hot foods, etc. I think the sensitivity will fade, but this past week I have been using only 1 strip per day and wow I am definitely noticing some constant tooth pain. I would recommend these as I think they are working well in terms of whitening, just as long as you can deal with the pain.Also, I have only used the top strips, and I am glad as I can't imagine how bad it would be to have both my upper and lower teeth aching so much."
4,Great Product True to Description,The item works very well however I didn't use completely as directed. I can not imagine using these strips twice a day. They do cause some sensitivity within the first two days of use but it goes away.
1,Poor Quality,This poster is printed on very cheap paper. Not even worth the couple of dollars paid for it. Obviously a cheap reprint.
5,Glass Tiger - No Turning Back,This is a great CD. Got greatest hits as well as 3 songs I had not heard before. Hope to hear more from this group.
5,Great CD but the DVD is even better,"Great new songs! A great lineup of classics. I recommend the DVD though, it has a band commentary that is sensational."
5,Excellent Resource,An excellent resource book for anyone who has gone through or is going through the grief process. Especially meaningful are the real stories from real people to illustrate the points the authors are making. A great book to to add to your library for future reference.
2,The author could be more specific...,"I don't know you, but I don't have time to lose.The author of this book could be more ""specific""...direct to the point, instead of defining defenitions."
5,"Great EP, and even higher prospects","I've followed this band since before they released this EP because my friend happens to be the guitarist. When i first heard their music I loved it right off the bat. They have an unbelievable love for their music and dedication in their field. I've only heard good reviews from their shows and everyone who has listened to their EP has enjoyed it and loves their genre of music. Follow this band and check them out on purevolume.com/madison or their own webite, madisonwebsite.com. Listen to them and I guarentee you won't be disappointed."
2,Toilet seat,I was disappointed in the quality of the toilet seat. I had expected a much better made seat and color was not what it appeared to be in the photo.
2,Poor hinge design,The hinges are poorly designed and you cannot get a secure fit. It is not possible to get an installation that does not move when using the seat.
2,Disapointing life,Filter fit and worked great for about 3 months then it simply stopped wicking up water. My previous Bemis brand filter lasted 3 years on the same water supply and was only replaced because of it getting dirty.
1,Item Arrived Bent,"This metal gasket was shipped to me in the original thin light-weight FelPro box, and so it showed up folded in the middle. Since this is a metal gasket, it was bent. I sent it back and got a refund. I will be buying this item from a local auto parts store, even though the price will be about $5 higher. An oil pan gasket I ordered from Amazon at the same time showed up in the same bent condition."
5,Satisfaction Plus!,"This information is long overdue! The lack of knowledge about how our brain is affected by the whole body system has caused so much unnecessary suffering, and keeps people in the trap of harmful drugs for a lifetime. God bless you, Dr. Hyman, for showing the way out of that trap and into a healthy life. Who knows how many people can see family members restored, as they were meant to be. Thank you, Thank you!"
3,be prepared for a scare!,this story keeps you in suspence all the way through!it was written a long time ago and therfore some of the english is difficult to understand.it is a shame it was not longer.the ending is very interesting and clever.i very much enjoyed this story.
4,Powerful but Slow,"This product is really powerful. However, it moves extremely slow to jack.This is a product that I will recommend it to someone I know."
5,Great advice at any time of life from 10 up,"Great book. Most of the advice is summed up in one sentence summaries that are easy to remember and the author advises the reader to collect his own. I wish that I had this book when I was 20 (38 now) but most of the advice is still applicable. I am reading one principle per week to my daughters who understand some of the ideas and will get the others later. I use it as a frequent graduation present. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,more of a paper wieght than a toy,"this was suppose to be a stress ball, i didn't know it would add stress instead of taking it away, it is way too hard and will probably only be used as a paper wieght"
2,Cute but easily breaks,"These are very cute stress balls, but the sand inside easily came out just by using normally. Would not recommend because they are so cute that it is sad when you have to throw them away because they are busted."
2,cheaper in the stores,"i got several of these toys for party favors at my kid's b-day party. They're ok for bag fillers, but i think this online price is ridiculous so i had to leave a comment...they shouldn't cost more than a dollar a piece, because they're not worth more than that!! It's just a balloon filled with what i assume is fine sand..then some kooshy hair on top..most of them have large print ""made in China"" on the back. they will wear and pop in time..again it's just a novelty stocking stuffer or party bag stuffer, not an actual long term toy."
2,My Moody Face Ball ended up with a grimpy face...,"I bought one of these at a local store and was super excited to give it to my daughter, who has sensory processing issues.Since Koosh balls are recommended for kids who need toys that they can fidget with, I thought that this would be a less expensive, fun little alternative for her to play with.Not so much.My daughter loved it at first; but within the day, she had managed to pull almost the entire chunk of ""hair"" off, exposing some crusty, yellow, industrial- looking glue that I definitely did not want her putting into her mouth.So, our poor little moody ball ended up with a grumpy face quite quickly after he had to move to his new home: the garbage can."
5,A More Comfortable Shoe Doesn't Exist!,"Although a little leary about ordering shoes without trying them on (especially with large/wide feet) I was completely amazed by the fit of this shoe. Better still was the absolute comfort in every step. I walk constantly while working and find this shoes to be as close to ""sneakers"" as you can get and still maintain a sharp apperance in casual clothing. These shoes are extremely well made, waterproof and very rugged. Even though I know that these will last for some time, I am already looking forward to a back-up pair in another color. You will NOT be disappointed in these shoes."
4,Be Aware - This is a REVERSE Cable!,"This cable is for connecting four SATA ports on a controller or motherboard to a single SFF-8087 port on a SAS backplane, and will not work in the opposite configuration (connecting the SFF-8087 port on a SAS controller to four SATA HDDs).Aside from that, this cable is high quality and well made, but I should have read the description more carefully before ordering."
3,A Passage to India,"Ravi Shankar introduced Indian music to the Western world. With the help of his friend, the late George Harrison, East met West in a spicy fusion. These ""Ragas"" date back to 1973,when master sitar player Sri Ravi Shankar collaborated with sarod player Ali Akbar Khan.Their ""Ragas"" are meditative. Each piece is about 20 minutes long (five times the length of the average pop song!) They aren't readily accessible to the novice listener. They take time and patience. Each raga is for a different mood or time of day. The pieces meld into each other,like the passage from sunrise to sunset.""Ragas"" helped introduce me to world music. It's a sonic passage to India. Sit back, relax, and contemplate."
5,One of Ravi's Best CD's,"I do not claim to have listened to all of his CD's, but this is my favorite."
2,"great playing, but sound quality is horrible","The playing on this CD is wonderful, the sound, however is so horrible that it makes it almost unlistenable. I guess this CD was released just because of the stature of the two players, but I found its absolutely dreadful sound quality to be too intense and traded it in. There are other jugalbandi recordings out there that are much better and I suggest spending your hard earned cash on one of them."
4,Works great and costs a lot less than others,"This boot fit just fine. As long as you know how to get the tie-rod off without breaking it, it is a big money saver for the DIY. The zip pulls are a lot easier than the old metal bands they used to use."
2,NOT SO,Without 'Zoom' 'Act Like You Know' and 'Teach Me How To Love' how can this be called a 'Greatest Hits' disc?
2,This one doesn't have Zoom,This greatest hits CD doesn't have Zoom. How can you not have Zoom? and it's not as Disco as the other CD such as:Best of
1,WT* ?,"I can't believe ""Zoom"" is not on this album. The words Greatest Hits should be removed from this album. Purchase ""The Best of"" instead of this one."
4,Game Plan for Getting into Private School,Peterson's starts with a general Planning Calendar beginning in 7th grade. It discusses what Private Schools offer and how to consider which type of school is best for your child. How to start looking for a school and how to help your child prepare for the application process. What to look for in a school and how to narrow down choices. There is a section about Financial Aid and finally the transition into Private School. It does not describe particular schools.I thought the book covers this subject well and I have read from several different sources.
1,Sturdy but useless,talk about flush mount. difficult to plug in cables and put on the wall without squishing fingers. Bad design all around.
2,Useful for residents,"To anyone who had read my other reviews, you probably know that I have been consistently disappointed with this series. They are relatively inexpensive and have nice tables.....probably a nice reference/atlas for residents who can afford them (maybe that really is the target audience). But I am a practicing pathologist, and this is another in the series that I just do not find useful. Whenever I need help on a difficult case, the more unusual entities or variants just aren't there. For my purposes, the only ones in the series I have really for worthwhile have been the Hematopathology & maybe the Head & Neck book....I will keep buying these to have a complete library, but....."
5,Most Accessible Work,"This, to me, is the author's most accessible and continuous novel, and like his other books, highlights the point at which the personal and universal meet. It is also an often-humorous ""coming of age"" story, but manages to avoid the sentimentality and overt nostalgia that sometimes mars works of this kind. If you are unfamiliar with Kaufman's work, this is a good place to start."
4,Worth the Heart Attack,Great book - got it after seeing it at a friend's house.Some great recipes that may or may not be authentic - the photos are great and the whole thing has a kitchy feel with Kohls wife.
2,Arrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhh --- my heart! It's exploding!,"This is probably one of the least health-conscious cookbooks to come out in quite some time. The 300-lb-plus Helmut Kohl took time off from his work impersonating dirigibles & blimps to try and kill us all with he & his wife's recipes. Granted, German cuisine is not exactly renowned for being low in calories or cholesterol, but this cookbook takes the cuisine's tendencies to their ugly extremes. The photography is great, and the recipes (at least the ones I had the nerve to prepare) are pretty tasty, but unless you want to kill yourself in short order, you should use this cookbook with great discretion."
4,"Good, but not his best","I have really become hooked on this series lately. Maybe I've read too many in a row, but this one did not impress me like the others. The villian is unseen for much of this, and it made for a less suspenseful, less complicated story.Also, I didn't quite buy the plot line this time. Wallander after being on sick leave for over a year, returns and is immediately running the entire force again, and on a hunch, taking on a hugely important businessman.It just seemed like there were avenues that could have been explored that were not, and that almost never happens with Mankell."
2,Boring,"I first thought that the translation was awkward but soon realized that the characters and the story were so boring that the translation was probably appropriate. I read a lot of mysteries and prefer those that have less violence and no serial killers. In that genre I would recommend : Donna Leon, Ruth Rendell, Charles Todd and Ian Pears (the art series). A brief synopsis of this book- Kurt is frightened. He drinks coffee and worries. He drives someplace and talks to himself about his instincts. he goes to a meeting where nothing happens. I kept hoping there was a Swedish equivalent of General Patton who would slap him and suggest he ""man up"". I gave up on page 207"
4,My hero!,I have read all of Mankell's books and I simply adore Kurt Wallander. Mankell's series starring Wallendar never disappoints. Plot really doesn't matter as much as getting inside Kurt's head. I want to go to Ystad and look for him....I'm sure he is really there looking out the window of his apartment at the gray and gloomy streets.
4,"Strong characters, weaker plot","Been meaning to read a Wallander book. The good news: Wallander is a compelling figure---full of remorse for what his job calls him to do; a lonely man undecided on maintaining his self imposed exile; a smart and resouceful cop. The writing---when it is good---is very good: the set up chapter is the murder of a lawyer and it is chilling; the passages where wallander interacts with a new female cop, older cop dealing with younger one, gets the tension just right ; a passage where Wallander realizes with a moment of clarity that someone is trying to kill him is pitch perfect. And the weather is a character in itself. The plot though is not up to the writing and is an excuse for it. Powerful magnate vs. small police department, with the second outwitting the first is serviceable but not believable. Looking forward to Henkell's next."
1,Disappointed,"For the first time, I was disappointed in a Mankell book. The writing was not as good as usual, and the conclusion was contrived and unsatisfying."
5,CAL TJADER- GREATEST HITS,"Cal Tjader's Greatest Hits, features many of his very best recordings with the Fantasy Label. The best song in this compilation being Cal Tjader's interpretation of Cuba's Chano Pozo's ""Soul Sauce/Wachi Wara"". This original version of Pozo's hit, in my opinion, has a better musical arrangement, percussion and more ""pep"" than his 1964-65 version he later recorded for the Verve label. Featuring an all-star cast that includes Rolando Lozano, Eddie Cano, Mongo Santamaria, Luis Miranda, Stan Getz, Vince Guaraldi, Willie Bobo, Victor Venegas, Bayardo Velarde, etc. this album is a must for all Cal Tjader and jazz fans."
4,MeMo,I bought these because they match my engagment ring! A little larger than I expected but will work for getting dressed up.
2,care apparel fleece walker grip covers,"These care apparel fleece walker grip covers do not fit standard walker grips. They are too big. The standard walker grip measures 4.5in long while this product measures 8.75in long. If you cut them in half like I did in order to avoid product return, the fleeces falls out. The product length should have been stated/listed in product review to avoid misrepresentation. Would not have ordered if review stated that these walker fleece covers are 8.5in in length. Surely one size does not fit all. The only reason that I am giving this review two stars instead of one is that RTA medical shipped quickly and filled order immediately. Arrived before the expected date."
3,Knights of Lazerus,"A good purchase for any fan or follower of the lesser known Military Orders of the Crusades. This one goes through the life span of the Lazurus Order in England. I found the prose to be a bit bland and wasn't as captivated as I get with other books.It is still worth the purchase for a complete library on the Military Orders and their ""offshoots""."
4,"Pictures, Pictures, and more Eyecandy . . .","It's a pretty book and almost entirely pictures. I was rather under the idea that it was going to have more text --text that allowed what Tori was really thinking about. It does provide brief exerpts from numerous articles, but most of them, I found anyway to be too brief. You're getting a great deal of images, but the insight is limited --so beware. I am glad to have this book, so don't get me wrong. I just wanted to let interested readers know that there isn't a whole lot to read . . ."
3,"I LOVE Tori, but.....","Although the book is full of wonderful pictures I was a little disappointed that there wasn't much to read. I love pictures of Tori, but these were much of the same style (backround, hairstyle, pose, etc.). I do have All These Years which is an absolutely amazing book that I could've done fine with just pictures because she just looks gorgeous in every one. Now that's a great book! I am a big Tori fan, but this book just didn't do anything for me."
1,Not What You Think It Is,"Based on the title, I purchased this book thinking it would be commentary from Tori on life, her music and lyrics or philosophies. Instead, this is merely a compilation of quotes and fashion pictures - just like a coffee table book. Although she is a beautiful woman with funny and intriquing comments, I'm more interested in her thoughts....If you were looking for ""Images and Insights"", read her Biography."
3,disco drive from the 80's,"IF YOU ARE INTO DISCO DRIVE SOUND FROM THE 80'S, YOU KNOW THAT NON STOP PUMPIN' MUSIC THAT KEEPS YOU GOING, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD. ESPECIALLY IF YOU NEED A FAST PACE EXERCISE SONG, THIS IS IT. THE ONLY UPDATED THING ON THIS CD IS A TWIST OF A LOCAL ARTIST SINGING PARTS OF THE SONG IN JAPANESE! HUMMM INTERESTING! THE REST OF THE ENGLISH LYRICS ARE A LITTLE STRAINED TO THE LISTENING EAR....BUT LIKE I SAID, IF YOU WANT A DISCO DRIVE SOUND, GO AHEAD AND BY IT. NOW FOR THOSE WHO REMEMBERS THIS ARTIST FROM ""BACK IN THE DAY"" PERFORMING IN THE OAKLAND AREA, YOU MIGHT JUST WANT TO BY THIS CD AS A SOUVENIOR I RATED THIS CD 3 STARS...1. THE CD ONLY HAS ONE SONG ON IT. 2. E FOR EFFORT 3. THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH FOR ONE SONG. I NOW HAVE A SOUVENIOR."
4,Well-written and funny,"""Rats Saw God"" is the very humorous tale of teenager Steve York's life. One English credit short of graduating from high school, Steve is asked by his guidance councelor to write 100 pages on any subject he chooses. After some consideration, he decides to write an autobiography covering his high school years. Alternating back and forth between his current situation in San Diego and his Freshman-Junior years in Clear Lake, Texas; the book tells the tale of Steve's parents' divorce, being sent to live with his famous astronaut father, his dadaist art club, and his first and most memorable romance with Wanda ""Dub"" Varner. ""Rats Saw God"" is written with a wonderful, modern voice and very likeable characters. The only complaint I have with this book is how quickly the last few pages (covering the time after Steve's graduation) were wrapped up."
1,UGGGGGGG!,"I read this book for a high school book club, and I could not stand it! I thought it was pathetic and discusting! I thought maybe by the end it would get better. Wrong! I hardly finished it I felt so sick. Don't give it to your teenager to read!"
1,NOT for teens!,"As a mom of 7 children (0-19 yrs) I cannot believe teachers & librarians actually think this is a good book for ANY teen to read. It disturbs me that it is being recommended to high school students, and even younger. This book contains explicit ""how-to"" instructions for first-time sex, with no consequences. Of course, it also includes detailed instructions on proper use of condoms, so maybe that's why its acceptable for teachers to recommend this ""soft-porn"" to teenagers with raging hormones. I just dont get it. Certainly there's something better educated adults could encourage these students to read!"
2,"what i thought about ""rats saw god""","what i think about this book is that it is a bok that is more for 5th grader's and i think that the writing style of this book is written so that you would be able to guess or know what is going to happen in the next couple pages of the book. i don't think that this book is that of a middle schooler and not of a high schooler.i belive that this book needs to be a bit more exicting such as explosions, suicides, homicides and things os that nature."
4,A Good Book Once You Get Into It,"I must first start out by saying that I was really surprised by the ending. Argh! I really don't like Dub! I thought that the book was well written, but I think that the author put to much wit into the character (so much that it was sometimes annoying). I also thought that Steve was too hard to get into and I was confused by the character because there were so many. However, the story was really good and I think that a lot of teenagers will be able to relate to Steve's life, problems, and feelings. If you see it in the library or are thinking of getting it, I think you should give it a try."
3,A Great source for reports,"Since I had to write a report on Apollo 13 I saw this book. I found the book to have surprisingly good information. It gave me the jist of what went wrong with the mission, and offered some world views. Despite the writing to be mediocre, this book helped me a lot. I enjoyed reading the book. And I believe if someone does have to write anything on Apollo 13 they should definitly use this book as a great source."
4,Nice Moses Basket,"Our baby spent the first 2 months of her life napping in this basket. It is both sturdy and attractive. I loved being able to easily take the basket into any room so she could be close by. Now, it holds stuffed animals and toys in her nursery and will be a keepsake for years to come."
5,Beautiful!,This Moses basket is beautiful and practical. The construction is very sturdy and it's elegant at the same time. Great buy!
5,Great purchase!,"I recently purchased this for my new born niece and she loves it. It's really pretty and the mattress and padding is comfortable.. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how big it was..from the pictures of my niece in it. (I have not seen the basket myself, cz my sister is in the US and me in UK)Also, the basket arrived a few days late because there was a snowstorm in NJ, so that's alright.All in all a good buy.. I would definitely recommend it to friends..."
3,good for the money,"I like the basket, but the fabric was a little stinky (like it had been sitting in a warehouse too long). I thought the fabric was covered in polka dots, but it was actually decorated with stars -- not a huge deal, I know. My baby isn't born yet, but I'm sure the basket will do it's job giving my baby a comfortable place to sleep anywhere in the house. Also, I wish this basket came in a honey color. All in all, it was a good buy for the price!"
2,Not too many pictures on the inside,"This book reads like a textbook for a botanist seeking Ph.D.. There aren't more than a handful of pictures making it difficult to create a mental picture of the specific species - especially when the descriptions nearly match one another, barring a few highly technical terms. You don't need this book unless you are going to ask permission to splice two trademarked species into a new one, and it is otherwise not written descriptively or interestingly."
5,amazing insights!,"I have struggled with an eating disorder for a long time and read many books on it, but this one really broke through to the core of my being. I'm going to read it over and over. It gave me a lot of hope and I think it'd help anyone with not only any addiction but just whoever is struggling to grow closer to God amidst life's ""stuff""."
5,Honest Hope,"I read your book last week and it was very good! I was impressed not only with the undertaking of writing the book itself, but with the real, honest, open and straight forward way in which you talk about your struggles. It is an inspiration to anyone who struggles with an addiction of any kind. I don't often get to discuss bulimia with my patients because most young girls won't admit to it. But when I do find someone struggling with an eating disorder, especially if they are Christian, I will recommend that they read your book. Your personal journey of recovery, as the subtitle calls it, reads like a companion talking to the reader. I think this approach would be very helpful for a young person struggling to admit and accept their disorder to realize that it is a real problem, they are not crazy and there is hope. Thank you for the gift of sharing your story! I am certain many people will benefit from your courage."
5,Powerful story,"The author's story is powerful. Her struggling from the depths of despair and self-loathing to confidence and being able to help others is inspirational. Any man or woman fighting against an eating disorder should gain hope, strength and ""techniques"" for survival from this book."
2,Too Religious !!,"I appreciate Katie and her struggle, as well as her awesome recovery - but this book did NOT tickle my fancy.It focuses on religion a lot (Christianity in particular)and how the author used it to recover, which is great and all, but it's just not what I expected. I was shocked that no one wrote anything about it's obvious religious focus on the amazon reviews so far, so it was important for me to mention it."
5,I Just Gotta Tell Somebody,"I've always been a fan of Betty Everett. She's from my hometown in the state of MS. The cd Betty Everett:The Fantasy Years is a ""MUST HAVE"" for fans of pop,r&b, soul,jazz & country music. This lady can do it all. After you hear this you will surely purchase the others on the page. Whenever I'm playing my cd (s), some person always ask ""who's singing that?"" The peoples choice on this cd are: ""BE ANYTHING (BUT BE MINE)"" ""THINGS I SAY TO HIS SHOULDERS"" ""WONDERING"" ""HAPPY ENDING"" I promise you it will be a happy ending when you're done with this cd. Ms Everett, if you should read this review, please get back into the studio. My friends and I tried it and we did like it."
3,A bit amatuerish,"I don't really like stories where the heroes save the entire world. The writing wasn't bad though the characterization was a bit sparse. A lot of action and an interesting world, but it just didn't grab me. There are too many really great books out there to suggest something mediocre."
2,Decent for a first book,"The barebone plot is certainly not bad and the indepth world is convincing. Yet, there are too many details that do nothing for the book, many sentences being long and overly technical. Much of the background information would be better relegated into a stuffy old history textbook!I would've preferred more action scenes, more story behind the characters; more lines for everyone. The ending wasn't too bad except I couldn't believe the characters would ""escape from their feelings"" after making it so far. At least put in some more effort, man, before calling it quits! I know Wells was trying for realism but *hint, hint*: in situations like these, a bit of ""out of character"" would lend some humour and make the reader go ""awww""."
3,"Golf Clap! A decent, but unremarkable, first effort","By-the-numbers, but there's enough flashes of unpolished originality to keep things intriguing. Wells has a nice hand for original settings that aren't all over the current sf/fantasy offerings, but the characterization and plotting just make it to 'ok.' Worth reading if you're out of new stuff, and she's showing definite artistic growth (see Death of the Necromancer). Get it cheap if you can, but get it."
3,Average,The two major characters fail to really engage your imagination. I really could not keep reading to find out what happen next.
4,A powerful breathing technique,"This is a very well written book into a form of pranayama (spinal breathing). The instructions are very clear, concise and it appears easy to develop a practice. However, according to some internet sources, Yogani shuns guru status, will not verify his identity as an author nor can he verify his version of what is stated in his books. One possible concern is the danger of these techniques. The literature is full of examples of people who have done irrepararable harm to themselves; however, according to Yogani, if one practices in a very measured and sober manner, there is little chance of harm. Yogan's techniques very closely mirror a well known yoga home study course whose author is a recognized guru; however, Yogani cuts to the specific practice and is an excellent alternative. It probably is best to have a teacher the further one progresses in these practices."
3,Worth checking out,"I purchased this CD simply because of Andy Votel's connection with Badly Drawn Boy and Twisted Nerve Records. I wasn't disappointed.This CD is a clever mix of low-key, easy-going electronic music with influences ranging from jazz to hip-hop. Equally suited for headphones or a party, the CD makes great background music, it's major downfall being that it is simply too short.Andy Votel is a creative individual who seems to have a natural inclination toward experimentation. It's pretty easy to find this CD for cheap, so there's nothing to lose!"
3,Excellent Demonstration Of What Latin Rhythms Are,These recordings are a general idea of what latin jazz was in the 50's and 60's. If you're seeking for latin rhythms this is the album for you. Two Thumbs Up!
4,Handy - pun intended : ),"The brush fits solidly in the hand, making cleaning of vegetable such as potatoes and carrots a breeze.My only complaint is that while I understand the finger slot needs to accommodate a variety of finger sizes, I would like it to be a bit less flexible. It tends to slip a bit when I kick it into high speed to clean enough potatoes for a picnic potato salad. However, it works really well for casually cleaning veges."
5,Works Great!,It's the perfect size and fits my hand perfectly.The bristles don't fall out.It does a great job scrubbing taters.What more could you ask for!
1,In your best interest to look elsewhere...,"If you need a book about T-SQL, go on to the next one. T-SQL is the SQLServer backend workhorse language, but this book spends almost half the pages describing how to perform tasks using the SQLServer 7.0 GUI tools instead of T-SQL. I can't understand that in a book titled ""TRANSACT-SQL"". Beyond that, if you want any sort of detailed understanding of the topics covered, you won't get it from this book. I would highly suggest the ""Transact-SQL Programming"" book from O'Reiley Press. That book gives you a complete discussion of T-SQL."
2,Ok reference book -- or for beginner,"Amo's Transact-SQL can certainly be faulted for the amount of time that it spends trying to describe how to perform somewhat mundane tasks in Enterprise manager and other SQL 7 tools -- great if you have never used SQL Server before, but not particularly useful for programmer or DBA turned programmer trying to learn Transact-SQL. The books redeeming strength, however, comes from the clarity with which the author is able to deal with more advanced concepts such as cursors. His explanation makes the concept very accessible to a beginner. The books excellent index allows it to serve well as a reference book. All things considered, this is not the book to buy if a large portion of you work is with a database; but for a developer or DBA needing to write a little Transact-SQL and not wanting to spend three-weeks reading a book like Vieira's SQL Server Programming it could serve as a good intro book and/or quick reference."
4,Good Intro to Intermediate Book,This book gave a decent overview of Transact SQL and its relation to SQL Server 7. It does give some useful hints on database admin inside of SQL Server. Don't look to this book as a nall encompassing reference to SQL Server although it is a good handbook to have around when programming Transact SQL.
1,Save your money,"This book is supposed to cover Transact-SQL, an advanced topic. But it uses a database which you must type in! Although it includes a CD-ROM, the database is not on it. If I want a typing exercise, I'd buy Mavis Beacon's. Most of the first portion of the book covers basic SQL tools. A complete waste of time in an advanced text. Also, much of the text and many of the illustrations are based on a beta version of SQL 7, so they don't even apply to the version you'll see (for example, see pg. 40, which tells how to create a Database Diagram, and is COMPLETELY WRONG). The writing style is also unclear and difficult to follow. The only benefit I got from the book is the author's name - I've used it to start a list of authors I'll avoid at all cost in the future."
4,Exellent Tutorial Material,"I like the book. If I had to teach a class to experienced developers without Transact-SQL experience, this is the book I would recommend."
3,Returned,"Not a bad system but returned after 1 day. Coffee tasted great and was ready quickly. Worked as advertised actually. I guess I was spoiled by my 4 year old Gevalia thermal bought at a garage sale for $5. Gevalia carafe kept coffee piping hot for about 12 hours. After 24 hours I could still drink it hot. Mr. Coffee was perfect temp immediately after brewing but got cool quickly.Reason for return was actually the fire-alarm like end of cycle alarm that beeps five times every time its done brewing. Also, the back-lit light is extremely bright at night. Again, coffee taste was really good, but the ""features"" were unacceptable even after one day."
2,It's going back...,"This is a flat basket brewer with a shower head spray design that produces an okay pot of coffee in about 5 minutes or so. The always-on, too bright dial is obnoxious, as is the high pitched beeping that lasts several seconds at the end of the brew cycle. However, the real killer for this product is the terribly bad design of the lid and the pour spout. You need to pour the coffee over the sink to avoid getting it all over the counter; forget about bringing the carafe to the table. The spout is so broad and shallow as to make neat pouring an impossibility. An improperly designed spout earns this pot a failing grade."
2,Not good quality.,"I bought a this one last year and it wouln't get warm anymore. Then I returned it (under warranty) last week and got the same machine. This morning it is full of water, gets hot but won't brew. The buzzer goes off immediately upon turning it on indicating that the brew cycle is complete. I even use filtered water in the thing. I really like the machine but it just doesn't last. This one is going back to the store and I will be buying a better quality machine."
2,Wonderful til the 1 year warranty ran out,"Coffee makers in our house usually last 5 years before they have to be replaced. Last year we shopped around and decided the Mr. Coffee Black and Stainless Steel 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker had the most bang for the buck. We have never owned a Mr. Coffee until now. We loved it until recently it started to act up, and of course the 1 year warranty just ran out a month ago. So we are shopping around for a new coffee maker, it won't be a Mr. Coffee."
2,Great coffee for 6 months if you escape water hazard,"This beautiful coffee maker has a reputation for leaking water. We too had to return our first unit after leaking all over the counter creating electronic water hazards, and the help desk told us to switch the back resevoir rubber piece so the hole faces down (no more leaks). Mr. Coffee was very nice and sent us a new unit right away telling us to cut the cord on the damaged unit. Apparently the units are assembled with the hole facing up instead of down. We loved the coffee (using the Strong setting, paper filter and Mr. Coffee filter), but now 6 months later it suddenly broke. Water leaked, the electronic display steamed up and blacked out, coffee slowly dripped through then burned on the bottom. If you don't mind spending this much $$ for 6 months, get it. I'm giving up since it will cost much more to replace our counters."
2,"has design flaws, not worth the extra money.","We bought this model about a year ago. It made decent coffee. The original pot that came with the coffee maker leaked, like many other reviewers have mentioned. I broke that carafe after a couple of months and the replacement carafe was better. My main complaint was that it did not use all of the water in the reservoir each time. This allowed algae to grow inside. The design of the machine makes it hard to see inside and to clean the reservoir if needed, and this ick needed more than just a run through with vinegar to fix. I tried to clean it and ended up getting water inside the circuits, which killed it. Between the leaking pot and the gross algae sludge developing in water reservoir, it just isn't worth the extra money. I replaced it with a more basic model that I can down into to clean throughly if needed."
2,It Should Have Stayed a Secret!,"This must have been this author's first foray into the world of romance novels. Elizabeth McCade has returned home after a disastrous affair and miscarriage with her college professor. She has remained aloof and reclusive for seven years until Black Hawk is injured and accidently falls into a secret tunnel which leads to her cellar. After this, the book falls into stilted sentences and dialogue, and even less interaction between any and all characters except Elizabeth and Hawk. They traverse back and forth in the tunnel to see each other (""I had to come."") He speaks like a character in a B grade western. I was waiting for him to lapse into something along the lines of ""Me, Hawk. You...my woman."" And this was supposedly a contempory! This story had the potential to be much better. Instead, it only disappointed."
1,INEFFECTIVE,"Doesn't work - and I have the spots to prove it. Before I developed an allergy to certain ingredients in high SPF sunblocks, I was able to use a regular sun block of 60, 70, 80 SPF and I was well-protected. I wish that someone would develop an effective sun block for sensitive skin."
4,Blocks sun with no stinging,"I've been using this on my face daily for about four years. Once on it is dry to the touch, a bit visible at first but then seems to soak in. It has a coloring agent in it to make it less visible on skin, and that agent will rub off on clothing and even stain light-colored clothes, so I don't use it for anything below my face. I like that it blocks the sun only physically, without the chemicals that sting and redden my skin. I also use the lip version of this product."
2,Gave me a tinted rash,"Within 30 minutes of applying this product, I had a rash on my chest, arms and calves and was a little itchy. Maybe I was just more sensative then the other reviewers. As other reviews have stated, you get a weird tint to your skin after applying what is supposed to be a dries clearly product. It also left me feeling oily. I ended up washing it off and trying to give it away. Nobody wanted it. Not that I can blame them."
1,ripped off with empty tube for full price paid,I love this product have bought it for years directly from the company.I bought one on amazon and it was almost an empty tube--it had 3 little squirts in it.I'll never buy it from amazon again.signed ripped off.
5,Great Product!,"The Cotz Waterproof Sunscreen is a great protective barrier for the skin. It could be applied to the face like makeup. I use it in my ears and nose, using a cotton swab, to relieve itching. It is a high-quality product. It is also useful to leave on the skin for several hours to help suffocate skin parasites."
5,Allergic to almost all sunscreens.,Except this one. Even Neutrogena Pure and Free Baby breaks me out in a itchy rash. Cotz does not. I hope the formula is not changed anytime soon. Yes it's thick but you want sunblock to do its job? I'd rather fight with a bit of thickness and tint and know I'm being protected properly than to waste money on a wimpy product.
4,Good choice for sunblock,"I cannot use chemical sunscreens and therefore must use a high SPF sunblock and most of those are very drying. Fallene's SPF 58 is the perfect mixture of sunblock and moisture for my skin. I liked the ingredient list for Cotz but wasn't crazy about it. This point is simply a personal choice for the skin guardian in each of us.Also, as with most general sunscreens, I did not and would not apply this to my face. Face specific lotions should be used for that. I love the slight tint, so you don't look like a ghost. Might not be okay for darker complexions, though. I'm caramel. It is lightweight too, my only wish is that they would leave out the parabens.Overall, I liked this product and feel it delivers as promises. Melts in high humidity, but excellent in drier climate. I agree with others that say it's a tad on the pricey side, but with the way it spreads a little does go a long way."
3,Use Sunscreen Where Hot,"This couldn't have been offered to me at a better time. A time when I was getting ready to go to Israel. And I'm glad I took this with me because it is very hot there during the summer and I was out in the sun almost on a daily basis (sometimes for hours on end).One day I spent four hours in the sun which is when I used this product the most and it really, really did what it was supposed to do which I am happy about because had I not used it, I might have ended up badly burned over half my body.I recommend this product if your planning a day on the beach or a vactaion to a hot place."
3,Contains Vitamin A,"According to [...], this product contains vitamin A, which may speed the development of cancer. They also state that claims for such a high SPF are dubious. It's hard to find a natural but smooth sunscreen. I've been through so many its disgusting. Sadly this is a very expensive sunscreen to have issues like these. Supposedly the same suncreen with SPF 40, for the face is much better (no vitamin A)."
1,It does NOT dry clear!!,I brought this product to use while in Hawaii. The application process was so frustrating!! It took forever to absorb itself and even after it did...it left your skin looking patchy and white. I have dark skin and there was no way I could go out with a coat of white all over my skin. I tried several times without any luck.
2,"It works, but...","The product works as advertised, which would be a big plus in my book ... IF it didn't discolor whatever clothes I happen to be wearing at the time. Didn't the people who made this stuff notice how hard it was to get out of their lab coats? That annoyance clearly outweighs the benefits."
5,Not greasy & works great!,I have been buying this for my friend who lives in Florida. She uses it on her face everyday. Her skin looks & feels great! She won't go outside without it! And it's been over 2 years that she started using it. I knew she'd love it.
5,Simple sunscreen,My dermatologist recommended I wear this since it is the simplest sunscreen available - hardly any chemicals - almost pure zinc. I love it.
5,Best Sunscreen Around,"This is the best sunscreen available for those looking for full coverage. Especially recommended for those with melasma or dark spots on the face. I use this product year-round and it is well worth the price. I also have no complaints regarding the tint - not sure why others have a problem but if you blend in completely, you should have no coloring issues."
3,Use when something more hearty is needed,"As far as I can tell, from limited use, this product works as well as any high SPF type treatment this reviewer has previously encountered. It seems to replace pure zinc oxide for the nose and it is more versatile for the rest of the face and ears . It's quite hearty and stands up to sweat and swimming to a degree. Unlike zinc oxide, when you properly rub it in you don't have to worry about looking as white as if you were on a cast call for Bettlejuice. I'll give it 3 stars and when, if ever they make a product that only has to be applied once in a 24-hr. period no matter what...that will be the 5-star product. Until that time this is one of the best prevention measures you can take, just remember re-apply, for safety's sake after very heavy sweating or extended time in the water"
3,Too bad it isn't colorless,"This sun block comes out of the tube like liquid make-up; it's tan, thick, and hard to spread around. It showed on my skin for a while, felt greasy, and rubbed off on my clothes, leaving a whitish smear. I had to be careful to rub it on my skin evenly or it looked like I did my make-up without a mirror.There isn't any scent, which is good, and I didn't burn in hot sun, but I wouldn't buy this product when there are so many thinner creams that spread quickly and disappear completely."
5,Nice!,"I have super sensitive skin and that is what this product is geared towards - those of us who cannot handle all of the chemicals on our skin. It is water proof and sweat proof for up to 3 hours. It covers both UVB and UVA. It comes out of the tube in a nude type color but goes on clear.The only thing I didn't like, and it wasn't enough to deduct from the over all rating - I didn't like the smell. It is supposedly odorless, but there is a slight smell to it. Honestly you cannot smell it unless you have your nose to your skin, but I have one of those noses that smells everything.The bonus about this product, I noticed, no bugs bothered me. I know this is not part of what it is for, however, there were big flies out where we were today and they all stayed away from me.Oh and of course the obvious?? No burn. No pink. Complete protection and I was in the sun at least several hours. Total recommend."
3,Works but with side effect,"This is a good sunscreen that truly works. But it leaves a light pale color on your face - like an unmatched foundation. If the color matches your skin color that is good. If it does not, it looks like a bad foundation.You may consider diluting and applying - dont know if that would affect the sunscreening ability."
2,Made my skin rough!,"The only good thing about this product is that it's not too oily, and didn't give me break out like some others. But it made my skin really dry and rough. I'm not sure if that's because of the high SPF level. Finally, I had to change. I tried Coopertone Oil-Free for face, and it worked really well for me!"
3,It's sunscreen...,"My friend tried this one since ordinarily most sunscreen makes her break out a lot. This one didn't, which was good for her. It kept her from getting burned, and didn't cause her to break out. So I guess it's good. It lasted about as long as a normal sunscreen and she re-applied it after about 4 hours. It wasn't greasy like some are, but when she sweats, it tends to leave....white streaks, oddly. It's weird, and this gets a 3 out of 5 because of it. Another thing: the smell is standard chemical smelling sunscreen. It's ok, but not the best."
2,Candy popper book,"This book is printed in Hong Kong. The resolution of the pictures here is so-so. There are 25 Mexican architects featured here and towards the end of the book, there is a directory of how to contact them. There are no layouts featured but simply pictures, an indication that this book is never meant for the cerebral readers or for architecture's enthusiasts. This book is a definite candy popper book, a book that would be forgotten in a matter of time. Every and each architects wrote a simple piece of their philosophy or belief. To put this into another perspective, this book is simply a medley of all architects mentioned combined. The writers didn't even elaborate enough about the pertinence of space, light, and color in mexican architecture. Perhaps, they are true believers in the fact that a picture tells a million stories. Can be better. Yawn ~"
4,"Not made for an ""03 F250","They are not very specific about exactly what models this thing fits.I have an ""03 F250, and it does not fit...It didn't mount right up, but after a little work with the dremel and a few extra screws, I made it work."
4,Pretty good,"Worked pretty well on my 2001 mustang, decent quality, fitted just fine, easy to install. Half the cost from the retailer!"
5,Dash Kit 2004 Ford Expedition,I used this kit to install a radio into my 2004 Ford Expedition. The installation was simple and the product fit perfectly. Great product.
3,"Fits, but it's not very stable","Whenever II push a button on my stereo, especially toward the top of the unit, it yields backward from the push. Not a huge problem, but I'd prefer if my stereo unit felt more secure."
5,Works great.,Fits perfectly. Had absolutely Zero issues with this mount. Its perfect for the price and does not look trashy. I had an older mount that was ugly and not made for my car so this was perfect!
3,good quality but doesn't feet all fords,"good quality, but this did not fit my 2001 ford f150, after some modification i made it fit but was alot of work to make it fit."
1,DOES NOT FIT 2004 MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS,"I'm a bit peeved. The product title would suggest that this fits my 2004 Grand Marquis, and Amazon's compatibility check ALSO said it would fit my car, but it absolutely does not."
3,Does It Work For 1998 Through Present Ford Ranger?,I bought this kit when Circuit City was closing its stores. I think there are more models this kit fits that may not be metioned in the instruction booklet. Does anyone know if this kit fits newer Rangers? I have a 2003 Ranger Edge.
5,Brownie & Sonny,"This CD collects two early Bluesville LPs (their first and fourth), recorded in 1960 (a major year for recordings for both Brownie and Sonny). The feeling on both LPs is very relaxed and laidback; most of the tunes are standard 12-bar blues (A-B-C and A-A-B formats) with a couple of 8-bar blues and one 16-bar ballad thrown in. Verses are out of the standard blues repertory.Brownie does most of the singing, though Terry joins on occasion for duets, and Sonny gets a few spots all to himself as well. Brownie's voice is clearly enunciated and mellow, and his accoustic guitar makes for perfect accompaniment. Terry, of course, blows harp and that axe is featured on folky items like FOX HUNT. There is a consistency to the high quality of the performances here that makes choosing highlights impossible: lets just say the whole CD is great. Definitely worth checking out."
4,Fast Paced Action,"If you are looking for a medical hero somewhere between Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan and Grishom's attorneys, then you won's want to miss the exploits of Dr. Laker in Clone 27. This book offers all of the twists and turns of a great mystery with the fast paced character development of todays best techno-mysteries. Obviously, the author has a great knowledge of medicine and medical technology and has incorporated that into the character of Dr. Laker. The scenario that develops is something right out of today's headlines or perhaps the headlines of the near future. I read the book in almost one sitting, it was so absorbing. Just when you think you know where the plot is going to take you, you are surprised at where you end up. Again, if you like Clancy or Grishom, then you will love Clone 27."
3,Could be better...,"Keeping my comments simple, this textbook is too verbose. Although the material is quite comprehensive, it suffers from poor organization that makes for a tiresome read. The authors should consider highlighting or indenting important concepts and equations for better readability."
1,disgruntled student,"This was the worst book that I used in my entire academic career. It was the most uninteresting thing I've ever read, and I enjoyed economics and finance before this class. The book did a terrible job explaining anything that had any actual application to it. Overall if you need this book I am sorry."
3,"Useful, but Utilitarian","I can't imagine using this book outside of a college course. It accomplishes what it sets out to do by reinforcing the economic principles form the book, and it tends to use real numbers, and a fair number of real world examples. Still it's just a work book, a mind numbing workbook, the type of which most people who went through High School should be familiar with.The book isn't 'fun.' But that's not what I expected. To it's credit the conceptual questions it ask are often relative. For example, one question was about ""Foreign Oil (palm and fruit oil) producers"" and the advertising they use to increase demand overseas for their product. Things like that are useful, and help keep the class relevant."
4,Interesting Choice for a Book,This book is pretty good as far as text books go. For those people who are very analytical and love things explained in numeric/math forms this is the book for you. I do wish it was more conceptual aka more import/export demand/supply oriented. Though if you're an econ person this shouldn't be too bad.
3,Okay At Best,"Book was in good condition. But it took 2 weeks to get it, which I felt was a little too long compared to the standard 3-4 day delivery."
2,frustrating,"This book takes the time to explain easy concepts in great detail (sometimes rearranging mathematical equations in trivial ways), but it fell short in explaining the difficult concepts. For example, on p532, it appears that the balance of payments is always zero for every completed transaction just because of accounting convention and not because of economic equilibrium; this doesn't seem right. Also, it makes some assumptions that could use some more discussion (for example, on p493, it states that supply of foreign-currency-denominated deposits is not influenced by the exchange rate, but is that really true?)"
1,Rowling wannabe,"The main characters are two dimensional cardboard imitations of children. The teacher comes as close as any to having a personality but even that is expressed mainly in a pair of eyes that fasten her cloak.The most interesting part of the story is that the main character, Leon, keeps pins in a map of the countries his taxi drivers come from.Boring, not worth reading...I tried to read it out loud to a fourth grade class and we could n't get past the half way mark and quit..."
2,Nothing Special,"I can't understand why anyone would give this book a high rating. It wasn't anything special. The writing was very average, the story not very interesting. I guess after reading better books, I have high expectations."
5,Love it!,"Unlike the other horse farm reviewer, I love this wheelbarrow. It works very well in my situation. And I like that I can put so much manure in it and it pushes so easily compared with my other more traditional wheel barrow.Mine is going on 3 years old and has held up well."
4,Used this for two years and I like it.,"I bought this over two years ago and wrote a review. I'm suprised the review is not here now. The unit works. Placing the load over the wheels or further back toward the handles makes it easy to lift the load and reduces any strain on the back. (Which is the reason for my purchase.) I use the dump loader at least once a week. Recently, I moved 3.000 pounds of gravel, and afterwards, saw no cracking or wear of the fiberglass body. Pushing down on the handle provides enough clearance for a relatively flat lawn. The two-wheel design provides stability you cannot find in a single-wheeel wheelborrow.The only issue I have with the load dumper is that the bolts securing the fiberglass container to the frame will loosen. I fixed that by adding a washer and lock washer to each bolt which solves the problem."
1,Non-dumping roller skate,"This seemed like a good idea at the garden center. It has proved to be a bad idea at home.The main problem is that it's completely unstable if the ground isn't absolutely flat. It wants to roll, and it will. Our yard is anything but flat.The other big flaw: although it has ""dumper"" in its name, the orientation of the tub is backward, and it's a significant hassle to get everything out. Even after releasing the tub (which hinges upward, away from the handle), material will remain in the curved far end of the tub. The only way to get the last bit out is to pick up the frame and lift the whole thing. (Hint: the best place to grab the frame is marked by two stickers that warn you not to put your hands in that spot.)Sometime later, we bought a two-wheeled conventional wheelbarrow (for $50, I think) that is just great. It even survived having a tree fall on it."
4,Articles on Southern Culture,"The ten articles in this volume provide interesting insights into southern regional culture. The unifying idea is that southern regional cultures can be studied by examining how people showcase their culture through display events and rituals. There is a great range of topics, here, including Mardi Gras, New Orleans jazz funerals, antebellum home tours, Scottish Highland games, powwows, and numerous other festivals. Each article can stand on its own, but the entire volume also provides a good study of regional culture and how various ideas of heritage are expressed in public."
5,great filter as long as you get the original honeywell product,Lots of people want to sell refurbished filters because it increases their profit margin but they don't work. If you want the original my advice is to e-mail them and ask if they are selling o.e.m. filters. If they say no then run........
3,Great Beverage! Way over priced,This is a great drink that I had all the time while living in France. I was hoping to find it here to purchase. I was excited to find it sold on Amazon but $10.50 for 6 cans (I prefer bottles too) is an outrageous cost.
4,"You will learn why they called Azcarraga ""The Tiger""","Very well written, concise, and in-depth biography of perhaps Latin America's most influential business magnate. The writers avoid dwelling on too much irrelevant detail, and offer a unique, unbiased, and thoroughly researched expose of Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, lord and master of Televisa and its subsidiaries, actors, singers, and employees, confidant of presidents and magnates, of priests and popes, of men and women. The Mexican Clark Gable of his era, every woman wanted to be with him, and men wanted to be him. A must read."
5,one of the best tribute cd's ever,after listening to this cd numerous times i think this was a labor of love for cameron michael parkes.in my opinion most of the tribute cd's i have heard are actually trashings of great songs.i.e. the kinks tributes.mr.parkes avoids the usual collection of hits and gets into some of brian and the beach boys best and most obscure songs.all done with reverance to the original recordings.i must add this cd is for the most devoted brian wilson/beach boys fan.sad to say it may be wasted on the casual listener.
4,DAMN BROOKE ALLISON 4 COPYING BOA!!!!!!!!,"Love the song, its kinda odd in English but very strong and powerful in Korean and Japanese!*scowls* How DARE Brooks Allison steal BoA's song?!?!?! Damn her and SM Entertainment!"
3,An interesting reference book but not much else,"An un-interesting list of coaches and who built them but not much in the way of detail and very few photographs. What could have been an interesting subject is made dull by page after page of just names and cars, very few photographs, few interior photos and no floor plans. No details on how the earlier units dealt with electricity, toilets, fuel etc. Unless you want a list of people who homebuilt their own motorhome and very little else, this book could be passed over. Surely the Smithsonian has photographs of most of the oldies that would be fascinating but by and large they are not here."
3,"Half The Story, Anyway","I didn't have a chance to look it over before I purchased this book. Had I, I probably wouldn't have bought this book.I can appreciate the difficulty in researching and writing a book on a fragmented industry. However, like the prior reviewer, I was very disappointed by the dearth of pictures. I was hoping more for a focus on the machines themselves along with historical narrative. The book is simply rather sketchy. This might be understandable for the early years in the industry, but plenty of material to work with should be available at least from the early Travco era on.I suppose I'm glad I read the book, as it's the only one I've read on this subject. However, I'd like to see this subject covered in a much more comprehensive manner, with regard to both writing and photography."
2,Product fails randomly,"My particular keyboard has keys that randomly don't work. Currently, the ""g"", ""h"" and space bar keys don't work (they worked fine yesterday), and in the past Escape has stopped working for a while. Since it's so inexpensive, it's probably not worth the money to send it back, but I will certainly be finding another keyboard.The keyboard is not the loudest keyboard I've ever used, but it's certainly not the quietest. The keys have nice tactile feedback.Look carefully at the layout picture before buying -- part of the shift key space is used by the turbo key, and the enter key bumps out the ""\"" key to the top row, thus taking up some of the room from the backspace key."
2,"Works, but soon becomes wretched to use.","This keyboard is poorly made and loses its initial usability quite quickly. The keys soon start jamming if not hit straight, and the backspace key is shrunk to a single square so I actually have to look for it. Had I known this, I definitely would NOT have bought it.I'm going back to a 10+ year old keyboard that's beige and heavy, but types beautifully. It was made well to begin with, and that's the entire point of a keyboard."
4,"Great value, great product.",This is a great keyboard and its price makes it a fantastic value. Well worth the money and all it is really missing is lights.
5,a great book for everyone that loves the game of baseball.,when I started to read this book I read the whole thing in one sitting.
5,Latin jazz mastery,As a fan of latin jazz I always knew about Cal Tjader but never got around to listening to many of his recordings--until I purchased Black Orchid. Now I realize how much I've missed. The performers are all superb as are the arrangements.The fidelity of the recording is better than one might expect from a fifties recording so don't hesitate for that reason. I especially liked the variation in tempos among the tunes that this recording presents-- just a great buy.
4,Cal Tjader Black Orchid,This cd is from the 60's...listening to it again has brought back many cherised memories.
3,tour the france type horn,"works great very loud. kit does not come with any wiring,fuse or connectors. also no button or switch for the horn. the amount of hose for the air supply to the horns is very short."
1,Doesn't sound anything like a turkey,Been lookin forward to this product for a couple of months and installed. Was very dissapointed that the horn sounded like a retarded dixie horn and nothing like a turkey gobble. How they can advertise a turkey gobble and sound nothing near a turkey is beyound me. Will be returning it.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!,"GAVE THIS TO MY HUSBAND FOR FATHER'S DAY. HE SPENT 4 HOURS HOOKING IT UP. IT DID NOT SOUND ANYTHING LIKE A TURKEY AND BURNED OUT WITH 5 USES. THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE, SAME PROBLEMS. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!"
3,Easy to Read,"This was easy for my four-year-old to read because she knows the story and it was easy for her to anticipate what the wolf was going to say and what Little Red Riding Hood was going to say. She likes the repetition and the familiarity; however, the ending left a lot to be desired. She was like, ""Well, if you're not supposed to talk to strangers, then what about the woodcutter? Did she know him from before, or is he a stranger, too?"" Then she asked me a million questions about why the grandmother wasn't covered with blood when the woodcutter chopped open the wolf.I think that the illustrations in this book are only mediocre. Little Red Riding Hood herself is pretty cute, but I think Emily Bolam could have tried a little harder. The wolf is not a compelling character at all."
4,Old guy,"Gellhorn's description of her travels to China with Hemingway, a significant part of the book, but less than half, is totally captivating and worth the whole price of the book. It was so good, it was extra disappointing that the rest of the book paled in comparison. I finally stopped reading about two thirds of the way through. Her description of her subsequent travels are out of date and relentlessly dismal. Still she was a helluva woman for her times and you should have an appreciation for her. She was witty, forthright and perceptive."
5,Mastering Oracle SQL,I was very pleased with the condition of this used book. The price was right and I received it very quickly. Very good service from this vendor. Now all I have to do is Master SQL!
2,What is the point if you cannot run your queries,"When it comes to technical books, the first thing that you would like to do is to check hands-on the examples given. I was so surprised and stumped that I poured money down the drain for a book, which the author assumes - can be read like a novel. Mr. Sanjay Mishra -Do understand that Oracle queries is not a Dan Brown novel where you can read page after page. I am utterly disappointed that even after you have Oracle Express available for free, you do not have one single instance of the part distributor database that can be used by the poor ""SQL learners"" audience of the book.I HATE IT. I HATE IT. I HATE IT. when I can read through something and not work.Get this book ONLY IF YOU feel like reading an Oracle version of a fiction novel. What was the author thinking? Shucks..!!"
3,Gets the job done.,"If you're hard up on money or don't want to spend a fortune on cables then these get the job done. The build quality is kind of sketchy though and I could see the cables dying out a lot sooner than higher quality cables would like monster. I would not recommend them for someone who constantly has to set up and tear down their set up because the cables don't take to being handled. They're not really high quality, so once they're set up, leave them there or you may find yourself soldering them relatively soon."
5,Great product at a great price,"the product is in good shape, with decent quality. It works great with my Nokia E61. the price is unbeatable. very satisfied."
4,No commentary,"I would just like to add something to the other comments, that is, when they say no annotations, or commentary, they mean NONE. It is the Qu'ran translated into English. No index, footnotes, table of contents, nothing. Not complaining, mind you, and not commenting on the quality of the translation. But be prepared to find additional sources for explanations and commentary."
1,Seriously bad translation of meaning,"I started to read this translation with some other Muslims and we didn't get far before we abandoned it. For example, on page 8 it says ""They say God has begotten a son. Glory be to Him!"" The negation of the blasphemy is missing from the translation. Also on page 10, it says ""Here is baptism from God; and who is better at baptism than God?"" The original Arabic talks about ""color"" - ""And surely Allah is the best of Colorers"". This translation seems to have been prepared with the aim of misleading. There is no baptism in Islam. Don't buy it if you are Muslim or if you want to know about Islam. Intellectually dishonest book, not the Qur'an at all"
5,An very enjoyable translation,"There is certainly no shortage of translations/interpretations of the Qur'an from which to choose. However, Cleary has a talent for the translators craft and makes a strong case for his own rendering to be considered high on the list of those to own or at least consult regularly. The language is rendered beautifully - in comparing key passages from the Qur'an, amongst several translations, Cleary's renderings are lucid and flow gracefully in contrast to others. Unfortunately there is no index or much supplementary material, but the translation speaks for itself anyway. Doubly unfortunate is that it is not sold directly by Amazon so one has to search elsewhere for a copy. I hope Amazon will be able to offer this translation directly - it deserves to be more easily accessed, widely known and used."
4,A neutral translation.,"I say that this translation is neutral because every word, including religious technicalterms (e.g. ""muslim"" is translated ""submitted one"", ""Allah"" is translated ""God""), is translatedinto English. This creates a problem because sometimes there is no English equivalent for certainwords in Arabic. It is better to simply transliterate a word or phrase and then use a footnote toexplain it's varied usage in Arabic.The translator is not a Muslim however he is Sufi leaning in his rhetoric in this translation.This is a good translation for reference but should not be solely relied upon for study or worship.It should also be said that there are no footnotes nor is there any index, just simply the text."
1,"Misleading, not a true translation","this translation is missing the timeline, the context and is very misleading. It appears to be written with a Christian leaning. If you are looking to understand Islam or are new to Islam, this book is not correct."
3,Just fine.,"The Chrome film series is nice, great for students or someone on a budget. The clarity is fine, not exactly what the pricey stuff offers, but definitely worth the price."
5,A Grand Treasury Indeed!,"This book was recommended to me for my children by a 1st grade teacher. I was reluctant to purchase it at first because of the price and because I had never read a book by Munsch. However, I decided to get it and, wow, are my kids happy. The book features many children's stories - most with silly goings on that keep my 7 and 4 year old boys in stitches. Every night for the last two months they ask to have one of the stories re-read to them. The outcome is always the same - laughter. This is an excellent work because it brings out the joy of reading for the kids. Definitely worth the money!"
3,Get his early works only,"I was initially charmed by Robert Munsch's early stories like ""The Paperbag Princess"" and ""I Have To Go"". So I bought the entire Grand Treasury thinking the same quality would be present in his other stories. Instead his later works border on creepy mysticism. Particularly the last story ""A Promise Is A Promise"" is quite bizarre and frightening to my young (6 years old) reader."
1,Not appropriate for Toddlers,"I purchased this set after reading the wonderful reviews here. I have to say I'm quite disappointed with these stories. They are really strange, sometimes scary and don't really have a moral to the story. My 3 1/2 yr old doesn't like them at all and she has quite an imagination but these were just too strange for her."
2,Not happy with Munschworks,What I didn't like about The Munschworks Grand Treasury is that few of the children portrayed are good characters to emulate and most of the adults are portrayed as inept and not respected.
5,Wonderful Book,This is a wonderful book. The author's work is superb. I received great service from the vendor.
4,Heavy Duty,"I bought these overalls for my husband to replace some he has worn so much I spend more time repairing than he does wearing. These pants looked great but they were very, very heavy denim and felt uncomfortably heavy and hot. They would be great for someone doing heavy duty work in a cooler climate, but just were not right for yardwork in a hot climate, so they were returned. The color is so very dark you almost can't see that they are denim. I am sorry that my husband did not comment on the fit so I can't help with that, but he did say that the fasteners on the straps were very hard to engage."
3,Overalls,"These appear to be really well made overalls. Unfortunately, the largest size waist that they come in is 60 inches. I am able to deal with the overly long inseam (32 inches) by hemming them, but, unfortunately, they do not seem to have the capacity to fit me comfortably. Perhaps after my gastro-intestinal bypass, I'll finally be able to enjoy wearing a pair of them. Btw, my wife tells me that I look sexy in them with no shirt."
4,"Good, quality workwear",I got these pants for my husband to wear to work. They have been great for him to wear everyday in cold weather.
4,Runs Long,"My husband lives in these and knew his size, but when they came, they were too long. We need to hem them."
5,Husband loves bibs,My husband does maintenance work and loves bibs. Belts have become a problem since his recent weight gain. Hope to find more colors in the single knee style.
2,Faulty stitching,"Bought these bibs for my husband based on Carhartt's reputation and ended up being extremely disappointed. Received the item in early December and by mid-March there was a complete tear in the waist-line stitching from the zip-fly to the right hand pocket. While I'm sure the added ventilation will be nice come summer time it does not fall in line with Carhartt's slogan ""Tough like the men who wear them"".Very disappointing."
3,Wish they were better.,"These were not my first pair of coveralls from Carhartt. These were my first denim pair though. Overall good, but not near as tough as the regular bibs. Only real dissapointment was the sizing. The denim seemed to be oversized. I normally wear a 34 length. My other bibs are 34's, but the denim 34 were like a 36."
2,Already had to repair these,"Work pants for the husband. Because he works around welders, I purchase the bib style pants for him to keep him from burns. They really help! But first thing to happen with this pair was the front zipper jammed due to the way they are made. I had to take apart the front to get the zipper to go down. Then restitch them back together. The zipper pull can go all the way up past the end of the zipper and gets jammed at the top. Then you have to completely undress each time you need a moment, instead of just using the zipper. I had to completely remove the zipper - move it up - and then rebuild the pants. Really? These are Carhartt! Normally a real good brand but not this pair!"
5,Good stuff,"A good, solid album of the Doctor's music. I never thought St. James Infirmary could make me want to dance, but this one with Mavis Staples does."
2,?,"this is a great, six-or-seven-year-old record. this version, printed on cd-r by amazon on request? haven't heard it--already have the original--but you wonder whether the sound quality will be as rich. buy the original folks."
5,Excellent,"it's a fantastic album! I've been playing it over and again ever since I received it. I'm so happy with my choice, not only Dr. John is superb, but the instrumentals, the back up singers and the talented performers that are also given the chance to sing by themselves. This album also features great songs like ""When the saints go marching in"" in a rendition that's brilliant and not often heard, as well as ""Lay my burden down"" with Dr. John and Mavis Staples that is all soul. The piano solos are superb, and I can truly say that there's not one song I don't like or that I like less. B.B.King and Willie Nelson are also featured. In my opinion this album is a real treasure."
4,Excellent Beginners Book,"This book is very good if you are just starting out. However, you'll quickly outgrow it and be looking for an intermediate book. It covers all the standard tools well and touches on ActiveX and database programming."
2,"Definitely the Standard, but.....","I disagree that this book is that readable. For me, I learn most of GSM from websites and other books (e.g. Modern Personal Radio Systems). This book has all the details, but it is writen in a way that I have to read the same section 2 to 3 times (or even more) before I could understand a bit. Many websites have clearer explanation for GSM than this book. I don't think this is the book for beginners who know nothing about GSM, this book is simply not an efficient guide for learning GSM for beginners."
5,Agreed! One of the finest documentaries I've ever seen.,"I have the tapes but am itching for a DVD release. This production, without question, is one of the finest pieces of documentary filmmaking. Not a dull rehash of familiar events but a film that is as relevant and compelling as anything that the best Hollywood yabos could ever cook up. Get the DVD out!!!!"
5,The Complete and Comprehensive Story,"An excellent video collectors edition of the complete Watergate Scandal. This series covers the entire Watergate Affair from start to finish and all the key players involved. It contains interviews from the Watergate burglars, prosecuters, FBI agents, Nixon himself, and all the Presdient's men. Also, contains coverage of the infamous Nixon tapes that brought him down. Highly recommended. Very concise, complete, and comprehensive!"
3,"A lot of wasted time, but it's OK","This is not the best tape about Watergate. In its 52 minutes, 6 (or 7) minutes are spent on a guy who hopes to get a copy of the 18+minute erasure, thinking that he can get the conversation out of it (unlikely). Also, there are about 10 minutes spent about who Deep Throat might be.Beyond that, the recitation of facts surrounding the break-in are not very coherent ... so, if you already know about Watergate, it is OK. The story bounces around quite a bit."
1,Boring!!,"(1.) Typical woods and stream - if you find this walk in nature exciting you must live in Detroit (sorry Detroit, I had to pick a city - it could have been any other city).(2.) Typical cheap hand held cameraman walking with hikers.(3.) Very typical someone in the woods is killing people only in this case the camera work and suspense and actual killings were juvenile and ho-hum beyond belief. Fast forward to save time and find another movie to watch.(4.) Acting? To call it acting is a leap in desperate defining.(5.) The geo cache angle is analogous to someone in a chicken custom in front of a mattress store - attention grabbing for 3 seconds."
5,Enthraling adventure into the real world,"The author takes the reader from basic concepts into the world of physics where I have never been before. It is not a book to take to the park to feed the birds. It, at least for me, requires concentration, energy and a love of anticipating the next step in how things came to be and why we think it so. I ordered five more related books as a result. What fun to be so challenged."
3,Not what I was looking for,Very small for the price I paid so i returned it. I paid a lot more than the original price for a used book albeit in excellent condition. It wasn't worth it to me.
3,So-so,I've enjoyed other Hurwitz books more. It was so-so. Fairly contrived and formulaic in a way. Not his best at all.
3,Extremely violent...,"Great story that follows the Rackley characters very well. But, the violence is almost over the top for me. The first 2 books in the Rackley series were violent as well, but not quite so extreme - and the stories are great."
5,Great series,I began reading Hurwitz with the first in the Tim Rackley series and really enjoyed that book. Then I went back and tried to read The Tower and The Program and couldn't get into them. Troubleshooter is a great novel and a very fast read.
4,4 1/2 stars,"Another great effort by Gregg Hurwitz as he brings back his ""troubleshooter"" hero Tim Rackley. The writing is good and the action is fast as Rackley delves into the lives of some evil bikers (aka 1 percenters). Hurwitz always likes to know about what he writes, so he was lucky enough to go out and learn how to drive a Harley. What a guy. Keep up the good work.Recommended."
1,Good game,"Pros:Good story line,ok graphics,Multiple storys,good Lan Multi-player.Cons:Gets boring,Bad Wi-Fi."
2,Bad compared to the older ones.,This game is not very good. First the controls r very hard to use and the flip and turn around buttons on the touch pad r hard to find when ur looking at the top screen. The graphics r pretty good for the ds but not the best. It is very hard to hold the ds because u r constantly using the touch pad then if u hit it to hard u lose grip of the ds and it falls. Now for multiplayer it is sort of fun but u do not unlock anything. The gameplay is also very hard i only made it to the fourth level. Not much replay value either. Other than multiplayer this game is not worth getting.
4,Just a good game.,Another solid title for the DS. Controls are very intuitive and fun. Give it a shot!
4,A interesting flip effect deck.,I have to admit that I really picked up this structure deck because I was curious about the Exodia looking guy on the cover (and no it isn't him or a variation of him) as others have said this deck's main focus is on the work of continuously using the flip effects of various monsters and monsters with low offense but high defense (but to go from offense to defense they supply you with Shield and Sword) while this deck is interesting right off the bat I can name a few flaws it has. This deck is weak against Nobleman of Cross Out and more importantly Light of Intervention. This really is a good structure deck if you want to use cards that not many others use.
3,"Decent, with the right strategy.","I bought this deck a long time ago, when it first came out. It has some decent monsters in it, but to excercise the full extent of their abilities, you have to follow an almiost entirely defensive strategy. You mostly rely on flip effects, and the occasional trap or spell card, and it makes for long, rather tiresome gameplay. I recommend that if you do buy this deck, you buy at least one more copy of Shield & Sword, because it only comes with one, and the card immensely strengthens the deck. I don't intend to completely trash this deck, as it can be quite powerful, but it isn't one of my favorites, and it does give you some useful cards to supplement other decks with. Overall, I give it a three out of five."
4,"Great, with limitations.","The good: The sound is great for a small unit. The dual-purpose mounting/portability is exactly what we were looking for.Now the warning: the description says ""for IPods prior to Sept 2006"" and that's very true. I bought my wife a 3rd Gen Nano for Christmas and thought this was the ideal dock for her kitchen. Seeing the notice, I checked with Apple to make sure they were still compatible. The docks are compatible, but the play/pause & skip functions for the IPod on the unit and on the remote do not work at all.If this weren't such an integral part of the unit, it would be a minor inconvenience. And if the controls worked, this rating would be a five. The iTone otherwise is exactly what we wanted, I just couldn't get a clear picture ahead of time what it's limitations were."
5,Great ipod speakers,We were exceedingly pleased with the sound quality and mechanics. Love them! And we're picky about our tunes.
1,Be careful - you mght be getting screwed.,"Unit was misrepresented. Claimed to work with all dockable IPods. Would play my 8gh Nano, but would not charge it. Factory said that was the case with the gen 4 Nano.. Returned product, but I am pissed that I had to pay shipping both ways for a product that was misrepresented."
4,My hunger grows in Pasadena!,"I always wondered what went on behind the facades of those elegant old homes in Pasadena! This was a fun read, and a perfect companion for the beach, airport, or wherever you happen to be whiling away a few hours and can't bear to listen to anymore ""news"" reports on the radio or TV.I think the author should explore some enterprising marketing opportunities that could be developed from this book (series?). How about a line of clothes/accessories for a Johnnie Collins collectible doll - sort of like Barbie only more upscale? Or a cookbook based on the heroine's entertaining extravaganzas and the special dinners she fixed for her hubby? I'd have to say this is the only mystery writer I'd want to have cook for me!"
1,Hokey,I recently bought this one on eBay not expecting much. I can't say this book offers a whole lot of insight and it is hard to get into the text based on the author's approach. It is hokey and not in a funny sort of way. It feels like he wrote it while spending some time inside of a large cardboard box in the cellar of an isolated prarie home.
4,Party!!,"This cd contains all lyrics and is ideal to play on parties or just if you wanna be Whitney. The songs are done in a propper way and the background isn't that bad at all! So if you just wanna groove to I wanna dance with somebody or just wanna Shoop the night away, this karaoke cd is the way to go!!"
1,This does not have CD+G graphics.,"The karaoke company doesn't purposely mention that this item doesn't have on-screen lyrics deliberately. This karaoke does not have any CD+G Graphics. It has a tiny lyric page as an inner liner with print so small G. Bush still can't read it with a magnifying glass. This only has several indescript musical tracks. Don't waste your time if you like CD+G Graphics because it doesn't have them installed. Also, it took too long to receive it in the mail. I would have returned it if I hadn't thrown away the envelope. Instead, I'll try to trade it for something else."
2,Fire the editor,"This is one of the worst editing jobs I have ever seen in published material. There is sometimes no continuity, incomplete sentences, no follow on explanations; just a poorly written and poorly edited book. You can learn a little about HTML, but it's a lot of work"
2,Rough around the edges,"This book can't seem to make up it's mind if it's a tutorial or a reference book, and in the end it does neither well. There are several cases where the text is talking about one thing and the images are illustrating something else. I have had to do to much of the work deciphering the information that is presented. I'm looking for another book."
2,So many errors it's unworkable,"I purchased this book to start learning HTML. While there appears to be a lot of information here, I found so many errors and omissions that I gave up after 115 pages. I just couldn't follow the examples, and found the page layout to be too confusing. The index didn't help much either - often pointing to a term used only once in the book without any further explanation. I bought a different book (by Laura Lemay) and have had much more success with the Lemay book."
1,as the other guy says....garbage!,"What movie was that other guy watching who gave this a good review?Before it manages to bore you to the point of falling a sleep, let me point out the highlights(1) very bad acting(2) very bad FX (blood looks awful)(3) very bad DVD quality (looks foggy, like and old VHS, or home movie)(4) Bad sound. No fancy hollywood THX stereo or surround(5) More of the movies budget was spent on the DVD disk and case artwork than the movie itself.(6) Will make you feel ripped off, whether you bought it or rented it...I rented it and feel someone should owe me a rental for this"
1,Poorly made garbage,"I love B-movies and the storyline of this one sounds great.Execution is another matter. VERY poorly shot, acted and planned, it is nothing but a waste of time. Add the fact that the soundtrack, something which COULD have been a major aid, was dismal at best and you have yourself another shot-on-video stinker. This is the lite/cut-rate/junior version of Deliverance as done for a high-school film class project."
1,Oh boy!,"A bunch of hunter are hunted by other hunters that want to eat their flesh. Gory scenes, that are ridiculously campy and none of the characters are likeable. Waste of time."
3,who's on first???,I maybe the only one who liked this movie. I thought the gore was there!!! A mountain gal with some help on the boobs and the dad was the coolist!With a little help from the internet this family would lure hunters up to their cabin in nowhere and instead of bow hunting deer they become the hunted by the family.
4,Need a few attempts to model,It took me a few attempts to model it right on my mouth and it is still not perfect.I'll have a try and maybe remodell it again.Breathing space is good. Feels that jaw is secured.Speaking (or even mumbling) with it is impossible but it is not its purpose anyway.Hope it keeps me protected.
3,I think I like it,"I am not sure about this mouth guard. I like that is protects my top and bottom teeth. It was easy to mold, but the back part got a little messed up. I might have pushed down to hard. I think i will buy another mouth guard so i have something to compareit to."
4,What a concept!,"It's great to be able to breath through this mouth guard and it's great to feel both upper and lower teeth protected. The drawback, however, is its bulkiness. Even after cutting it down and fitting it, the mouthguard is wide. It does take some getting used to, but does seem to be good protection."
2,Quite big,"I guess my mouth isn't big enough for this mouth guard but I don't think it's that small. I'm not super experienced with mouthguards and at first I simply thought you had to really bite down hard on it but after the first couple of gagging responses, I gave up. I still used it (better then chipping my teeth) but it was a distraction I didn't need when facing down a defensive lineman."
5,"Kyle ""Armbarmanwon""","This is a great mouth piece. Fast and east fitting. Easy in and out of the mouth, not to mention the ability to breath well. I would recomend this to anyone and everyone. It is a great product. Kyle"
1,low quality,"low quality. Item came just fine, but it was not clear instructions and did not give a good results at all."
5,Great product! Fits the need...,"I have two teenagers who wear braces and play contact sports - wrestling and martial arts. Finding this mouthguard was like finding a treasure. This product not only protects the teeth and jaw, the construction of upper AND lower guards protect the soft tissue of the gums and inner lips from being cut by the braces. This lower lip protection was exactly what I've been looking for because, as anyone involved in sports knows, the mouth, lips and gums can bleed quite a bit - and braces increase that chance during contact sports. The air vent is another great feature that allows them to breath easily during exertion. The boys say they are very comfortable to wear. I will be ordering extra LoPro Plus mouthguards."
4,BRUXISM USE = EXCELLENT!,"I've been grinding my teeth my whole life (30 years) and on the advice of a dentist am now using nighttime dental guards. I have chewed through 2 expensive Splintex Dura Guard mouth pieces. So, I discovered Brain-Pad LoPro+ on Amazon, and saw that someone else, too, was planning on using it for nighttime bruxism. I have a small mouth and ordered the junior. I'm 5'8"", medium-sized bone structure (size 10 shoes) female caucasian. For my use, the junior works fine. It does NOT cover my molars. However, if I needed it for athletic reasons I'd re-order a size in medium. I'd rather cut it to size than have to re-order yet again! I used the Brain Pad for the first time last night and it was better for me than the Splintex dental guard ever was. Whodathunkit?"
5,Brain Pad Worth IT!,I have used the Brain Pad mouth piece for sleeping with great results. It prevents my teech from grinding while sleeping with the added benifit of helping with my snoring and sleep apnea.
2,Not good for breathing,"So I test drove the mouthguard while sparring, and I have to admit I wasn't impressed. Despite being designed to allow mouth breathing, the passages are barely enough to provide enough air to someone sitting on a couch, let alone exercising. I would not recommend this mouthguard for athletes/fighters."
1,Poor fit and uncomfortable,"I admit to writing this without having tried any other mouthguards, but I'm not impressed with this one at all. The groove for you to rest your teeth in seems too shallow so it is very easy for it to come out of place. I also find it very uncomfortable, even after I cut off back ends (as suggested by the instructions to provide a proper fit). Unless you are 8 or 9 feet tall and have a gigantic mouth, I highly doubt it will fit without cutting off the back ends. So you're stuck cutting off the back ends to try and get a proper fit, but of course even if you're not satisfied after that, you can't really return it in that state. Also the case it comes with doesn't stay shut."
4,Still Smiling - Recommended,"The Brain Pad LoPro Mouth Guard is a easy to fit and comfortable once sized correctly. We bought 3 of these since my teens and I have taken up TaeKwonDo and do contact sparring.The fitting process is a little tricky since we had to cut two of them down to fit in my kid's mouths, but it was well documented in the instructions. Next came boiling the guards and fitting the in our mouths while they were still warm. This was good for my son and I, but my daughter has very sensitive teeth and this caused her some discomfort.Once in, these allow a lot of air flow which is great when sparring!Recommended!CFH"
2,"too bulky,, to awkward","i figured I'd buy this mouth guard because i spar with friends and planned on getting into boxing again.. read the reviews.. did some research.. this mouth guard seemed legit and quality. it shipped fairly quick so that was a plus.. but it was to bulky in my mouth and the directions on trimming it were a bit vague so i didnt mess with cutting it because it stated that it only needed cutting if your teeth were not in the channel. so i just followed boiling instructions(done this a few times in the past) than molded it to my mouth.. seemed like a better fit..but then i realized the sides were pushing into my cheeks.. re-boiled.. no more bulging sides but didnt seem like it was fitting correctly and the bottoms dug into my gums. don't think i can use this mouth guard :/ I'm dissapointed, spent over $15 and all the mouth guard did was make my jaw sore from clenching on it."
1,Not for grinding,"I have significant bruxism (grinding & clenching teeth) when sleeping. My dog ate my expensive dentist-made night guard and I needed a quick replacement. Saw some reviews that were very favorable for that purpose. I bit through this device the first night. It was useless and oversized. I did cut it down considerably and the fit was not too bad, but that really didn't matter, since I chewed it up. I'm going back to the dentist for a real night guard."
1,Uncomfortable,"The instructions for fitting are not complicated, but this doesn't fit my mouth at all. I don't have an ""overbite"" at all, but no matter how I fit it, my lower jaw ended up jutting uncomfortably forward. This and the fact that it was too large vertically for me to close my mouth (even with my lips comically stretched) were extremely unpleasant. Might be usable for sports, but for TMJ/sleeping, I would say this is useless. Since I tried fitting it several times, I can't return it, but I'm going to throw it out rather than get horrible wrinkles from stretching my face out with it (not to mention contorting my jaw)."
1,Shoddy,"After six months of happy brushing with the Hydrabrush, I decided to order and try the long-reach brushes. I'm on my fourth set in under a month: each started losing bristles--in clumps--during brushing.Trust me, I was following instructions: I wasn't biting down, I didn't twist the brush head, I was following the contours of my mouth.I love my Hydrabrush--but at least one batch of bad brushes sneaked past quality control."
5,Best product ever!,One bad checkup after another. Now my dentist asked what I was doing different. It has to be the hydrabrush. I now have great checkups!
2,Stick with Oral B,"I had an Oral B toothbrush, which I lost on a trip and decided to get this. After 2 months of using it, it really hurt my gums - so I switched back to Oral B."
2,not so great,"As far as canned air goes, this is probably the worst brand I've ever bought.1, It stinks to use - literally. The air it has does NOT SMELL GOOD.2, the plastic straw that inserts into the nozzle does not fit correctly. It stays in for about 2 seconds, before launching itself into whatever you are cleaning.Other than that, yeah, it's canned air and you can use it to dust off things easily. But I'd buy another brand besides this one!"
3,Can of air.....,"PROS: It works just like any other can of air and can be used on computer parts like motherboards...etc without damaging anything. The straw stays inside fine.CONS: It contains a chemical called ""Bitterant"" which is to prevent people from inhaling the air, but is very annoying when using in a room because the smell is really bad so if your cleaning a computer or something like that with lots of dust, you should take it outside."
2,DOES NOT FULLY WASH OFF!,"I've let my kids paint with these twice, and neither time has the paint washed out fully from their clothes, the towel they got it on or the carpet it dripped on. I'm not an complete idiot - my kids paint outside, but it does get on their clothes (they're 2 and 3) and before I stripped them bare, it was all over my house. I've washed the towel twice now and still can't get it out. Neither Resolve nor just soap and elbow grease will get it out of the carpet. I'd never had any trouble with other washable paints before. Sticking with Crayola..."
3,Melissa & Doug Post Paint Set,"These are great vibrant colors. I would order bigger bottles next time, because my daughter and friends went through them pretty quickly! The paints are NOT washable even after soaking clothes in oxyclean."
3,good paints - but very small bottles,"Buyers beware, these are very small bottles of paint. The paint is fine and if this is the size you need, then all is good. Just know it won't last very long at all especially if your little ones really enjoy painting."
5,I use this every day,"Great starter kit, good value. I have all kinds of stuff hanging from these tracks (ladders, weedeater, edger, shovels, rakes, gas cans, etc. There would be no way all this stuff would go in my garage and allow me to park both cars in the 2-car if it were not hanging on the wall."
3,great idea,"We just installed the track in our garage. I missed in the description that the kit contained 2 4linear feet pieces. So you can install them as one 8ft track or two 4 ft tracks. Our garage walls are not perfectly straight, so it was a bit of a tricky process to make the short tracks flush with the wall. If it was one 8ft piece I think it would be easier - just like moldings.My main complain however is that when you remove whatever you hung on the smaller hooks - the hooks come out with it. We put tennis rackets on small L and J hooks. And when we remove the rackets - the hooks come loose and one end of the comes out. You have to correct it each time. Bigger hooks seem to be in place. If anybody knows a trick how to make the hooks stay in the track -let me know. Thanks."
4,Just like getting a professional pedicure,"I must be getting old because all of a sudden my feet are so dry and rough and I have tried every lotion, cream and ""as seen on tv"" product and nothing works. Then I came across this and bought it. It works great! All you do is use it once a month and your feet are like soft baby feet. It is super easy to use. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think they should have a little chart in it that says what each of the tools are for. I actually found something on the internet and printed it out and put it in my case so when I am using it I know what to grab for the job I need it to do. This is exactly what the professional use. Its best to use this on dry feet so no soaking your feet prior."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent product, first class, high quality, easy to use! I stopped spending money on the cheaper ones and bought this one, I now have something that works and will last for a long time!"
3,Works as Designed.,I purchased this product and have been using it for several months. Overall I like the product. I like how it smooths callouses and nail-beds. I have used it to buff my nails and the results are good.It's a bit pricey and the pieces all have to be replaced which adds more expense... I'm not sure the cost is really worth it? The case is nice and helpful in keeping everything together and organized. It would of been very helpful if some type of product instructions were included as I didn't automatically know what each tool was for...
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this product based on a lot of the good reviews and was very disappointed when I received it.First of all, one of the kit tool seems to have been used by someone else because I could clearly see one spots on the tool itself, the handle also seems to be dirty which give me another indication this was used by someone before. There is not even one piece of paper/instruction with the product, which makes it very confusing to use.I am not recommending this to other people."
5,Great Solid Handle,I bought this to do alternating pullups on a power tower. The metal feels very solid and is able to take all of my weight (165lbs) with no problem. It is a great buy and is made with high quality.
5,Good product,This is a good product. I am happy with it. It is very solid and gets the job done. I use for close grip pulls to work on the middle back between shoulder blades.
2,cheaply made..,Better off just buying a Hampton row/chin bar that won't split apart in less than a year. This thing is way overpriced by the time your account for shipping. I found a much higher Hampton MCN-R bar locally for $35 that has better welds and rubber covered handle grips.
3,wait until a new edition,"This book is a few years old and in terms of NYC real estate it is ancient. The numbers in the book are so dated; imagine getting a prime 2 bedroom condo on CPW in the 60's for under 1 million! If you want to find out where the condo's are, this book is for you. Otherwise wait until the next edition."
3,IELTS 5,"In this book, There are 4 full-length test only..There no more practices and there are no explations sections and type of question by one by..There is not useful for starting..You can test yourself before exam with tests only.."
1,Sick & tired of this over used script.,"I am so sick and tired of this over used script of a maverick CIA guy, a director who hates him, a president who loves him, an Arab, and a dead lover. There are a dozen guys out there writing with this formula and it's getting very old. I am coming down on Britton just because his is the last book I have read; I could be writing about Flynn, Baldacci, Reich, you name it."
1,"disappointing sequel to his earlier book, The American","The poetic style of Andrew Britton's thriller The American is missing in this sequel; the book badly needs an editor to rework the manuscript.Sadly, the storyline is obscured in pages of violence and amorality, tediously over-described, very serial and disconnected.Just shows you become what you think aboutJack Higgins writes sleek thrillers pared to the bone.Mr. Britton might want to take a look at the Higgins style, in which less is more.As it is, Britton's book, The Assassin, is overstuffed, boring,and disappointing, and it's too bad, because Mr.Britton probably has some things to say.Hidden somewhere in the extra stuff. Watch what'cha think about."
4,First read,This was my first read of this author and it was enjoyable. The plot kept you involved with the characters and there was several twists and turns that were not expected. I will add Andrew Britton to my list of authors to watch for new adventures.
3,Not his best,"The story is complex with many characters. The plot line is confusing at best; undecipherable at worst. Too many people have too many ""super skills"" for my taste. Everyone can't be so talented, even at the level that these folks operate. Not Britton's best work."
3,Loved it but needs improvement,"I like the author's writing style and the book was good but as others have said it has some glaring research flaws and I hope he listens and does the research in the future. Most of these authors that write thrillers especially the spy/action type like this have this flaw that separates them from the Barry Eisler's in the field. As a reader of these type of novels I must say errors in operational details or lack of good spycraft etc are the biggest reasons most writers never get to the level of Eisler, do the research please we want to enjoy your books! This author has potential and I will read on to see if he improves. I for one hope so I need more good books to read and these have potential!"
3,"predictable, but page turner","A good beach read. Lots of action,most of it improbable, but keeps you reading."
2,Over the top.,"I liked The American but I found this book tedious, very long and basically over the top. SPOILER ALERT: He really lost me when they broke into the German Embassy. There was never a doubt that Ryan Kealy would ever lose or die, it was like reading a cartoon, very disappointing and over done."
3,Pretty bloody,"I suppose I am to be intrigued by the characters and motivations of a couple of stone killers, but they seem very uninteresting, if vermin. The hero survives so many catastrophes as to be fairly unbelievable. However, the tension in the final, lengthy scene is high and well done."
3,hard to open,We get this from the grocery store in a larger container.It has a safety seal of a white circle.It is so effective that it is almost impossible to remove.If only they would put a little tab that we could pull!Until then we will continue to attack with knife and scissors to get to their yummy salsa.
1,Naaaaasty stuff. Yuck.,"After a hard day at work today, I was seriously craving some chips and salsa for dinner. So I went to my neighborhood store and all they had on offer was La Victoria and Pace. For some reason I thought the La Victoria might be the lesser of two evils. Boy, was I ever wrong! This salsa tastes like Satan's ingrown toenail. It is the worst-tasting salsa I have ever put in my mouth. It manages to be both slimy and pasty, with a texture not unlike mucilage. The label doesn't list any added sugar, it has that deathly-sweet taste that defines ""horrible salsa"" in my book. There's only one good thing I can say about this product: one bite, and my intense craving for chips and salsa is completely gone."
5,Perfect,Just as described and perfect for fast reloads. Having extra of these is quite a necessity. Product came extremely fast as well.
3,heavy duty? not really,"Just bought the V28 set and put it to work right away. The batteries are good but not as good as all the hype. The 1/2 hammer drill was used to drill 5/8 "" holes in a concrete pad with brand new Bosch bit and it started spinning grease out of the chuck shaft. Not a little, but a lot. The drill lost reverse and would only turn clockwise. I contacted two Milwaukee service centers for warranty work since the drill was only a couple of days old. Both shops were nice enough but one was too busy to give me the attention I needed on the tool. I mailed the tool to a shop 75 miles away and they said they would replace the switch. The repairer kept blowing off the grease thing. I would have expected more from a warranty on a very expensive tool the was only used one day. It should have been replaced or at least thoughly checked out. Once I get it back, been two weeks now, I hope it's as good as new. Maybe spend the money on different set?"
1,Batteries are not reliable,This was a very expensive combo kit. I bought it because I'm a do it yourselfer and I try to buy the best tools to make my life easier and so that I can enjoy doing the work with good tools. The batteries in this combo failed early - just over one year. I took them back to the Milwaukee store here in Dallas and they reluctantly replaced them for me. Now they are both dead again...Check out the price of new batteries - omg!I would not recommend buying the 28V Combo Kit unless you have lots of money for spare batteries.
2,Not impressed,"I bought this kit (the new M28 not V28) and I can't say I'm impressed. None of the tools have a clips to hang off a tool belt which is annoying. I bought this kit to replace a makita set that was aging. The makita drill wouldn't hold bits tight anymore after three years of use. This drill didn't hold bits tight anymore after 3 days of use. So it went back. I liked the sawzall. The circular saw was bulky and left handed. I much prefer right handed saws. The battery packs are poorly manufactured and do not fit snugly on the tools. I'm not giving up on Milwaukee just yet. I'm returning this set and buying the newly re-designed 18 volt set. If that set doesn't work, I'll go back to the Makita 18 volt I already have."
1,chuck sucks,"i will give this kit a chance but the first time(and only time so far)i used the hammer drill the chuck locked up and i could not get the drill bit out, i had to use a pair of channel locks to open it.the dewalt kit i previously owned for five years never locked.the battery meter feature is nice for homeowners but a contractor uses the tool until the battery is dead.i like the flashlight better than the dewalt, the dewalt snakelight doesnt adjust well and breaks.the beltclip is nice if you wear a belt but i dont,and no one wants to see my hairy white as_.i may send this kit back if this happens again."
5,Great set of tools,"I purchased this upon the suggestion of carpenter friends who held Milwaukee in high regard. This set of tools is extremely solid, contractor grade. Although the sawzall and skill-saw aren't as powerful as corded units, this will serve most DIYers just fine. There is plenty of power. I am currently doing a major home remodel (down to studs, new pluming, electrical) and these have worked great. The flashlight is a bit weak, but is decently rugged and gets the job done.The 28 volt provides good power over 18 and the lithium ion is the new standard. The batteries have full power until completely dead. Thus, you have useful power the entire charge, instead of using it for a short while and have to recharge when only halfway discharged.You also may want to check Milwaukee's website for promotions. I received a fee orbital sander and wet/dry battery vacuum (which I use more than my tool set!)Overall, this is a very good quality set, and is highly recommended."
3,Low quality for the Price,"The light and saw-saw seem to be OK. The drill is not the quality that I would expect from Milwaukee. After 3 months of use, it is so week on the high speed that you can stop it with your hand. It will run down the battery in minutes. The circular saw is not as strong as I would expect. Save some money and buy a less expensive DeWalt or other brand."
3,Problems with the 28volt batteries,"I love the tools, and the batteries are great until they break. We use these in a commercial plumbing bussiness, and have been averageing a 50% failure rate on the 28 volt batteries. They have all been covered under warranty, but it has been very inconvenient to have to send them in and get replacements. I'm wondering if there's something we're not getting about this?"
3,Gimme a break!,I love these tools and the power but the damn flashlight was assembled in a hurry or something. The connections inside have broken due to the wires rubbing against the swivel head. What's up with the quality control over at milwaukee.
4,A darker kind of Spiderman story.,"If you are looking for a darker story told mostly through a villians eyes, then this is a story for you. The forward by the author is interesting and you can tell that events in his life shaped the mode of this story. The art is well done, definitely has an 80's vibe but it works well. I don't know much about Spiderman lore but this story makes Kraven a top notch villian."
3,I may be in the minority here but...!,"I've never been a HUGE fan of Kraven he was a pretty D-List Spider-Man villain. Usually the stories he were own were pretty OK. And that's what I think of this story it's not horrendously bad but I don't think it's as great as people make it out to be. People have always told me how great this story was and that I needed to pick this up as soon as I could, and I did but I didn't think it was as great as people told me it was. It probably would have been better if they had cut Vermin out of the story. Who's Vermin you ask? So is half of the comics-reading community. In short Vermin was a crappy 80's character that Dematteis loved to play around with who had no purpose in this story was for more pyschobabble that the story could have done better without. A plus of the story is that it's Peter's love for Mary Jane that helps him escape.In short, buy this story it's OK but be warned it's not as good as people make it out to be!"
5,Great read,The vermin character was a different twist to the story. Kraven was always a nut but this story was worth the money.
1,RIP OFF NON CDG,"This ""karaoke"" CD is just that a cd not a CDG. There are no word graphics, just a lyric sheet insert, with many incorrect lines. The arrangments sound like they were made on a 6"" casio keyboard in 1985 by a small child, and for the $'s you can do much better with almost anything else. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT..."
3,VERY AVERAGE,"Far from the best for Sidney Sheldon. Given the current scandles besetting the White House and a certain President's libido, the subject of this novel is very topical. Unfortunately, it is too predictable and far too short for my tastes. Give me ""Master of the Game"" or ""The Other Side of Midnight"" any day. The plot is paper-thin, the characters one-dimensional. FINAL VERDICT: ""The Best Laid Plans"" is an improvement on Sheldon's previous two attempts, but wait for the paper-back."
2,Readers Don't Digest!,"For those who are Sheldon's die-hard fans, his latest book definitely comes short of our expectations. Despite the fact that the plot is laudable, some of the characters lack conviction. To cut a long story short, the book is tumultously written and suffers from quite a few shortcomings."
1,What happened to Sheldon?,This is by far the worst Sidney Sheldon book I've ever read! It insults the intelligence of the readers. It's so trashy and there's NO SUBSTANCE whatsoever. This book is so shallow!!! I was so disappointed after reading the book--I had such high hopes when I bought it--I thought it would be as good as his other books such as Sands of Time and Master of the Game. Stay away from this one...
2,A mediocre disappointing Sheldon,"Having read all of Sidney Sheldon's novels, I expect from him a gripping and entertaining read. Really nothing more than that. His stories flow with intrigiung characters and twisting plots. Best Laid Plans was the worst Sheldon book yet. The plot lacked depth and the characters seemed rather one-dimensional. The book was a fast read and mildly entertaining, the ending had an unexpected twist which is always nice, but yet this book lacked my interest and was not a page turner. If you are new to Sidney Sheldon, you might want to read his books backwards, starting with Best Laid Plans because his books get better as you travel back in time. Is Sidney getting too old? Is he tiring or running out of in depth plots? Let's hope this was only a mild setback and hope his next one answers my questions. Angela Bernardoni"
2,Patchy story,"When things seemed to be going one way-- the way they didn't go-- all I could say was that this book is so bad it's good. Amusingly, stupidly, unbelievably bad.When things seemed to be going the other way-- the way they really were going-- all I could say was that this book is so bad it's bad. Not funny, just stupid and unbelievably bad.The actuality of the book deserves one star, the potential it held for some time is why I added the other.A word of advice to anyone attempting to write a book with a ridiculous plotline: go big or go home. Be all the stupid that you can be! Don't even try for one second to be anything less. Give in to the stupid with abandon! Don't be a Sidney Sheldon and do the less stupid (but still stupid) thing."
3,"Sappy for the most part, but readable.","About a year ago, I couldn't keep my eyes off this book when I entered a store. Each week that it was there, I'd pick it up and flip through it; I was determined to somehow read it. So, now, a year later, I finally have read it. And I am somewhat disappointed.Sheldon never really made you care for the characters in this book. Adding Zoltaire was no great biggy, either. The bad guys were unobvious, which is is good, but the bad guy was a really good guy at heart. Now, it's true that good, Godly people do go wrong, but, hey, THIS badly??At times I felt that I was reading a soap-opera than a suspense novel. Overall, this isn't a half-bad book and I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could."
1,BAD... GARBAGE..,"This book is very unusually shallow. I mean, for the standard of Sidney Sheldon, it is universally stupid and very dull."
2,"Weak story, little closure","The story started strong but seemed to get lost. Characters were poorly developed. Too many were introduced and then abandoned allowing for a loss of focus by the reader. While the surprise ending was clever, the book screams for an epilog of some kind."
2,"Shallow, though readable","Although this was a highly readable book, I found it to be rather shallow compared to some of his other books. There is no charachter definition for the three main charachters, so I really didn't care what happened to them. In fact, I didn't even understand the importance of Dana. I even figured out 'who-done-it' way before the somewhat less than shocking conclusion. Hopefully Mr. Sheldon's next bone will have a little more meat on it."
1,Trash,Twisted perspectives combined with a meaningless plot make this book absolutely avoidable unless you are a die-hard Sheldon addict!
3,"clever, professionally done but shallow","I can appreciate why a lot of people liked this book. It's clever, retains the readers interest despite the lack of depth. This would make a better soap opera than a book however. It left me with a hollow feeling. I learned nothing, had no new experiences or insights into the world as a result of this book. But it accomplished it's objective -- commercial mass marketability."
4,Shocking-quick read.........,anyone whose ever read a Sydney sheldon novel will must know by now that Sydney sheldon is not a one who wastes pages on trying to put an imaginative Picture of the real things happening in the pages..........no haunting nor intriguing stuffs........but none the less his books are fun an enjoyable books to read and thanks for HIM........so mnay people have become Book lovers.............his books touch every Notes of a Bestlsller...........the BEST LAID PLANS is probably not his most Gripping book but none the less Sidney SHledon is such a Master of Deciet that you can be shocked with the susepnse........well i was.........its prpbaly his most shockign book............and fun and beliveable.........a good book--Sidney Sheldon uses his power of the Author and the Pages to misdirect us to a shocking conclusion.......yeay read it!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Could of been better....,"I am a big fan of Sidney Sheldon. I did like this book but it could of been better, I thought the end was very good. Overall, a good book if you can't find anything else to read."
1,Don't waste your time...,"What an awful book. There was almost no character development, and I never got to the point where I cared about any of the characters or what happened to them. There was little detail about events that seemed to be important, and the dialogue was trite. The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that it would get better. The single positive about the book is that it is a quick read, and it requires absolutely no concentration, so you can read it on a plane or other noisy place without worrying that you are missing anything important."
5,Total Enjoyment,"If you're looking for a book to linger with over a weekend...buy this one and one other because there will be a lot of weekend left when you finish. It's a rapid read following such characters as Oliver Russell as he progresses up the political ladder to the Presidency and the steps he takes to get there. Here's a man we love to hate. Then there's Leslie Stewart who begins as a sweetheart and evolves into a woman not to be reckoned with. Meet the people in between these two lives and get drawn into their world. There's even a trip to Sarajevo where you'll be ducking the gunfire. Get the book, settle in and enjoy!"
4,Hard to put down,"Leslie Stewart epitimizes ""a women scorned"" Her search for revenge takes her to the height of success. When her goal is in sight, Sheldon works his magic and surprizes not only his ""scorned"" heroine but also the reader."
3,The Best Laid Plans lacks substance and is hardly gripping!,"Gone are the days when one could not put down a novel by Sidney Sheldon once reading had begun. The Best Laid Plans was not in the least bit exciting, and I'm still trying to figure out what the highlight of the novel was. Moreover, I was not impressed with the ending - it seemed like something an amateur writer had written!"
1,His worst book,Unfortunately this was a very superficial book. I didn't care about any of the characters & the plot was too shallow. What happen to his Master of the Game days? This I believe is his dullest book. Let's hope his next one is back up to standard!
3,Not The Best Laid Book,I am a true fan of Sidney but this book was too shallow for my taste. In comparison with Bloodline or Master of the Game i would rate this book as a FAILURE but on its own its a light easy reading book.
2,It is disappointing!,"The book has been given a wrong title! I don't find any 'plans' throughout the book except Leslie Stewart 's marriage to Chambers and her subsequent expansion of her news network. But are they 'best laid' plans? Dana Evans is the only 'likable' character in the book. But her story has no significant relationship to Leslie's revenge. Moreover, quite a siginficant portion of the book is about her. This makes her appearance quite awkward. Her story in fact deserves a separate title! To the contrary, the characters of Leslie Stewart and Oliver Russell are not in depth enough. On the whole, the story is shallow!"
2,Definitely not Sheldon's best,"I was disappointed in this book because it seemed like I was reading an abridgement. He glossed over and simplified important events; it truly felt like someone had edited out huge chunks of narrative and detail that would have made it more believable.It was still entertaining and had an interesting ending, but I wouldn't really recommend it. I don't think he'll ever top The Other Side of Midnight or If Tomorrow Comes, my favorite Sheldon books."
3,"Readable, but...","This book was readable, but left me unsatisfied. I would have liked Leslie to be a strong character (eg Jennifer Parker, Tracey Whitney, Kate Blackwell) but she came off as being bitchy and petty. Rather than drawing on her personal tragedies to come out on top, she was goaded into recklessness and the whole fiasco blew up in her face. Sadly, I didn't feel bad for her. I prefer characters that are appealing enough to root for. Also, Dana, who was highly likable, seemed out of place, almost an afterthought. It was as though she wandered into this book without substantial cause. In all, the book was worth a read. Not terrible, but not worthy of Sheldon's name."
1,Sheldon's worse,"First of all the book is about the political world, I think there is enough about poltics on tv without this book, secondly the characters aren't likable, expect for Dana. Lesley was okay at at first then i stopped feeling sorry for her when her revenge led to treating other badly, plus the plot isn't good. The only good thing was Dana in Sarajevo even though I didn't see how that fit in the main plot. At least Sidney SHeldon researched the subject well as he usually those but this novel was really terrible."
1,Boring...Sydney Sheldon at his worst.,"I've been slugging through this book for three weeks. The only reason I'm trying to get to the end of this book, is because I paid for it. The plot is weak, the characters shallow and unbelievable. The expressions used (""...bad hair day."", makes me think that Sheldon has been living as a recluse these past few years and is just completely out of touch. Very Disappointing."
3,Best Laid Plans Review,"I've read quite a few Sidney Sheldon books, and this one was a letdown. If it hadn't been for the ending, I wouldn't of liked the book much. Yet, when you start reading the book, and take note of the title, you sort of knew the ending already (if you've read as many Sheldon books as I have). I would not say that this book was excellent, and it was not terrible either. But hey, if you're a Sheldon fan like myself, you'll WANT to read every single one of his books."
3,Not so interesting book,On opening the book I was shocked because there are no pictures in the book and so many pages with small letters. And after reading the first page I became even more disappointed because I didn't know any bloody vocabulary (I'm from Germany). So I picked up my dictionary and translated the whole book. After a year I had finished reading and started to think about the story and I must say that the novel isn't so boring like it looks like to me before I didn't understand any word. At the end it's suspenseful. Last but by no means least I think this book is a novel for adults because in the story is much about politics and many s..!
1,The worst one of Sidney's books,The characters are stupid and boring. The story is too simple for a book with 400 pages.
2,Sheldon at his best?....I don't think so,"What a disappointment. I haven't read Sheldon in a while so I settled down for a good read on vacation. I kept looking at the author name to convince myself this was really Sheldon. This novel lacks any depth. The descriptive paragraphs and development of characters is thin at best. The plot was interesting but very predictable. No, I didn't have the ending figured out but three quarters of the way I almost gave up on the story getting any better. It is worth reading for the plot twist at the end, but you can skip the first 100 pages and not miss anything. Sheldon has certainly lost his edge. I think I'll go back to his earlier works I have yet to read. His very best were ""The Other Side of Midnight"" and ""Memories of Midnight"", even though they were written years apart."
3,Good book!,"When I opened the book I expected an interesting and realistic story. I liked, that it was easy to read but unfortunately there were so many pages. I also dislike that I couldn't identify me with anyone of the characters."
1,"Knock, Knock?? Where are you Mr. Sheldon??","""The Best Laid Plans"" was a definite disappointment. I mean, where did the REAL Sidney Sheldon go?? His last two or three books have been major disappontments--this one, Morning, Noon, & Night, and the one before that. Mr. Sheldon is a genius no doubt, but somewhere in the past few years he's been losing that ingenious creative writing skill that he used in his earlier novels. What happened to the ""sit on the edge of your seat"" thriller like ""Master of the Game"", ""Stranger in the Mirror"", ""If Tomorrow Comes""? I miss the depth of the characters that he lacks to define in this book. Yeah, I'd like to say that because of the political theme of the book I have given it a thumbs down since I'm not into politics;however, that is not true. A good book is a good book--and this one ain't one of 'em!"
3,Sheldon slides downward,"As a long time reader of Sidney Sheldon, I can assure you that this is no ""Other Side of Midnight"" which was truly outstanding. ""Plans"" is a good short story mascarading as a novel. It is predictable. I figured out one-third into the book that Tager was too good to be believed! Maybe Mr. Sheldon is tired; he deserves to be due to the number of good books he has written. But I would love to have him emulate his earlier books."
2,Gee willikers; GET OVER IT!,"I'm very seldom not entertained by Sidney Sheldon, and this book was no exception. I however did not LIKE either Leslie nor Oliver, but kept reading to determine what would happen to them. So... It was hard to put down, but a gentle, nice book, it's NOT! Talk about the ""weakest link""... whew!"
3,"This book has a great beginning, but a rather flat ending","I love the whole idea of, ""Hell hath no fury..."" if only Mr. Sheldon would have stuck with that. The main character fizzled, and instead of getting her revenge she just turned into a b--h."
3,Rushed Ending,"Great build up of characters but a disappointing climax. Dana Evans, the reporter, was built up as much as Leslie and Oliver but only had a minor part in the storyline."
3,Käsebrötchen learns reading and thinking!,"When I first saw the book I thought it would be boring because it looked like. By starting reading the book it became suspense. But in the second half it became difficult because in every chapter the scene changed. So when I one day didn't go on reading and then started with a new chapter I didn't know what happened before. It is very easy written and so very easy to read. The story is nearly realistic. It's not like normal life, but it's also no ""superman""-story. There are different but interesting characters. The book is an animation to try to realize dreams because the characters pursue their aims, although they were very high."
3,Good Reading for the Commuter,"This book was perfect for my train ride home. It was written in a manner that grabbed my attention right away, didn't require too much concentration yet it interested me enough that I couldn't wait to pick it up to see what was going to happen next. I highly recommend this book and others by Sidney Sheldon for anyone who reads while traveling."
5,Chanter hopeful,"The reviews made me sort of wish I had not ordered this one but they must have monkeyed theirs because mine works perfectly, is in tune, and the instructions are clear. The only problem is my talent is lacking the catch on power so far but I am working at it."
3,Half and Half,I found the practice chanter hard to blow and difficult to separate. It looked better than it sounded. However the book and CD were helpful and easy to understand.
2,Do yourself a favor and purchase a quality product,"The practice chanter I received is out of tune past C and is cheaply made. The original reed did not function correctly and completely disintegrated upon removal. After purchasing and installing a quality Gibson reed the chanter is playable, but as I said, out of tune.The included book an CD are not bad and fairly helpful.I think most people would be better off saving up and purchasing a decent instrument from a recognized manufacturer (Dunbar, Gibson, etc.)."
4,I bought this as a gift,"I bought this as a gift, so it's hard for me to rate it. I was impressed by the appearance of the chanter, it's a lot prettier than the picture shows. The metal bezels appear to be engraved. I like that it came with a book and CD, and the shipping was fast. That being said, the reed that came with it did not work. I later purchased the assortment sold by Ethnic soundsBagpipes - Assortment of 6 Premium Practice Chanter Reedsso that my friend could try some different reeds and (hopefully) find one that he likes. If you order this chanter, I highly recommend that you get some extra reeds with it."
1,Dont waste your money!!!,If you are serious about learning the bagpipes you are going to have to start out on a practice chanter. This practice chanter is junk. It squeaks and sqawks like a sick goose! Buy a better chanter that costs about $80 or more. Beleive me its worth the extra money!
1,JUNK!,"While I didn't get this product from Amazon, I did buy the exact same package at a music store that was actually a two hour drive away (I was determined to learn bagpipes).So, I get the chanter and book and all of that for $45, drive back home again, and when I play the scale, the notes that are supposed to be the highest in the scale were about 2 or 3 octaves lower than there were supposed to be. After just minutes of playing, the other notes began to play the same way.I am VERY dissatisfied with this chanter and regret not spending extra money for the Dunbar practice chanter."
3,Euro dance cheese!,"Ahh memories, the 90s were full of these types of compilation cds but this series was always pretty solid.Kind of cheesy listening to it now but nice melodies and setups! :D"
5,Love the color,"This is my favorite lip gloss ever. I love the color SO so much! It's a light pink and it's just absolutely perfect. It's the tiniest bit sticky, but it's great and it smells good too."
5,How to Speak Alzheimer's,"My siblings and I, all read this book. Our mother has Alzheimers. In order for all of us to help her, we decided to read this book. Thus all of us have similiar tools/techiques to use while visiting/talking with her. This book was VERY HELPFUL and the approaches have been VERY Easy to use! Thank You."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent resource for families trying to manage a loved one with Alzheimer's Disease, teaching valuable easy techniques for keeping communication going and helping to reduce frustrations. Joanne was a delightful guest on my 'Coping with Caregiving' radio program at wsRadio, sharing so much important information.-Jacqueline Marcell, Author 'Elder Rage, or Take My Father... Please! How to Survive Caring for Aging Parents', International Speaker on Eldercare & Alzheimer's"
5,Depends,"It depends on how progressed the Alheimer's is-it's good for the early stages, but I wouldn't recommend it for the later stages of the illness."
4,Information on Alzheimer's habits,I bought this book and have thus far been very satisfied with the content and information. It has helped me see a new side of my dad who is dealing with this disease at the young age of 55. I would recommend this book.
4,Understanding Alzheimer's Disease,Excellent read---very helpful for a caregiver. Great advice & counsel for more respectful responses and handling of person with Alzheimer's.
4,Help with Alzheimer's,"This book really helps a caregiver understand how to sensitively address the needs of a person suffering from dementia such as Alzheimer's. My wife has a form of Parkinsonism which presents very much like Alzheimer's. I have learned so much from this book, it is simple and yet explains a whole viewpoint, apart from just discussing the mental deterioration; one sees how the loved one views situations. A real helpful presentation, a very sensitive complex subject, a very practical help."
5,A must read if your loved one has dementia,"This book has practical tips to make life as good as it can be with a loved one with Dementia. The author is compassionate and describes in simple terms how a person with Dementia sees the world and how we can support them with respect and practical changes to their environment. Reading this book made me feel even more love, support and care for my partner of 26 years who developed the disease in his 50's. He had a brilliant mind and now has difficulty speaking and even dialing the phone. I am very grateful to the author for being a voice for this disease. As I suspected the caregiver's attitude is most important in easing difficult situations. Mrs. Coste has vast experience and offers wonderful stories of how caregivers can try a new approach in many different situations. I thank Mrs. Coste for being the voice for those we love who have lost theirs."
5,Excellent book for caregivers dealing with Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease takes an enormous toll on the emotions, and the physical and psychological health of the caregiving family members. This book is a godsend to all caregivers, other family members, or anyone dealing with this disease in a work setting.This is a must read for anyone with family or friends suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or other dementia, whether or not you are a care-giver. The book enables understanding of this dreaded disease, and communication with those who suffer from it. You will learn many techniques and build compassion after reading it.I found so many suggestions and helpful ideas, it was amazing. There was a lot of information that I had not been aware of before. It gives you a view from the perspective of the person suffering from this disease.She sees these demented, often paranoid, confused, sometimes combative persons as the person he or she once was, not as they seem to be now.[...]"
2,To Much Fluff,"As a caregiver with two Alzheimer's victims, I found the book to be a how to do little right and treat the patient like a mindless doll. I prefer a real world approach to AD not one from fantasy land."
4,"The person with Alzheimer's come first, not the symptoms","Those new to Alzheimer's disease will find this book to be a helpful guide. Even those who are familar with caring for someone with the disease will find nuggets of wisdom in the middle section, ""The Five Tenets of Habilitation."" It is here where Joanne Koenig Coste is at her best in describing how to preserve the personhood of those with dementia. This section alone makes the entire book worthwhile. It's about time Joanne put her thoughts into a book--she has been helping people navigate their way through the choppy waters of Alzheimer's for over 20 years!"
5,Very Useful for the Caregiver,"As a professional caregiver, I'm grateful to have found this guide book. It is FULL of useful information, and has had an immediate impact in the way I care for (and think about) Alzheimer's victims."
5,Best book I've found for caregivers of Alzheimer's patients,"My husband (a neurologist) and I own a company that educates both family and employed caregivers on how to appropriately interact with dementia patients, a mission born out of our experience with numerous loved ones with dementia. This book is the best I have found to recommend to caregivers. It is written by a woman whose husband was diagnosed with AD in the early 1970's while he was in his 40's. There were no resources available at the time, so she had to develop her own caregiving methods. In the intervening years, she has refined these methods into an life-affirming approach to care that promotes the dignity of the individual. It gives tried and true techniques for dealing with things like combativeness, independence, dressing, bathing, eating, wandering, etc. --- all the major issues faced by caregivers. It is a relatively short and easy read, but packed with useful information. I give it my highest recommendation."
4,WYSIWYG--What You See Is What You Get!,"One look at this book and I was intrigued. Then, a moment of doubt clouded my purchasing-decision-mode--could I judge this book by its cover? I've been wrong before. I purchased it anyway, and no, I wasn't disappointed. WYSIWYG...I've come to count on Scott's novels for cyber-action, leavened with humor, sprinkled with a pinch of Christian lessons, and full of likeable characters. Gillette and Hamilton's interaction is always enjoyable, as is Hamilton's relationship with his family. Like Tom Clancy's character, Jack Ryan, Ethan Hamilton keeps climbing the professional ladder, finding greater demand for his skills in each novel. I hope their are more rungs to this ladder. It's not everyday I find well-written Christian fiction, but Jefferson Scott's novels are worth it. If you can't locate them, keep looking. Blame me if you're disappointed."
4,Great Book!,All three of the Ethan Hamilton books are fantastic - I love the adventure and intelligent plots.If you haven't read Virtually Eliminated or Terminal Logic start there first. Fatal Defect kept me turning the pages - I had to know how it would work out. It combines great adventure with a modern high-tech twist - a definite good read!
5,cocktail glasses,Iam very happy with these glasses. They hold a very good size cocktail. They also have a unique design which makes them look and feel expensive!! These are a great buy!
5,Smooth Jammin,"In this collection you're hear clean mixes, nice arrangements and a contemporary approach to reggae. But what hooked me on this set was the vocal work. The singers are pleasant and engaging. They stick pretty close to the original lyrics. You'll get lots of holiday cheer on a smooth bed of reggae music. Enjoy."
1,Excellent book but not the Kindle version,"Almost every page has formatting errors, typos, errors of various kinds, some minor, many serious. It's hard to understand how the publishers have the gall to charge $15.00 for this. There are some omissions that render the text incomprehensible; I can't even be sure just how much text has been omitted. Prof. Smith has written an excellent book that obviously required much work and careful attention to detail, but his electronic publishers have sold him out. This book makes me want to turn in my Kindle."
5,A wonderful book.,"My fund of knowledge about this great American was poor at best prior to reading this book. I found the book excellent reading, very nicely presented, and an extremely enjoyable and informative work. I would rate it right up there with JOHN ADAMS/David McCullough. Now, I have to get my hands on USG's personal memoirs!"
4,Good overview of Grant's Life,"This is a well written account of Grant's life. Smith in particular presents a more positive view of Grant's presidential years. The revision seems warranted. However, for the casual reader, the meat of the book deals with Grant's life up through the Civil War years. The section on the Mexican War is adequate, but more insights on Grant's involvement could have been offered. Overall a great companion piece to Grant's own memoirs."
2,Where is the man in this book?,"I still prefer McFeely's book on General Grant to this one. Smith is a respected historian, but comes to Grant with a big handicap: he knows nothing about him. No matter how hard Smith crammed on Grant, you can't turn yourself into an expert in one or two years.There is nothing about Grant's children in this book. For a man so devoted to his family, this is a terrible ommission. There is also very little in this book about Mrs. Grant, to whom the General was fanatically devoted. Why did Smith stint on Grant's private life? This is the eternal mystery."
4,Grant us a good book,"Civil war sections good. Like most recent histories, the book gives credit to the good intentions of the Grant Administration but too little blame for the incredible scandals."
3,A decent overall look at his life.,"This biography does a decent job of looking at the overall life of Grant. Other biographers have focused solely on his military career. And while this biography does a decent job, it is not detailed enough to do real justice to any part of his life, when compared to other biographies. Smiths description of Grants milatary career, doesn't hold up at all compared to Catton's work. The author stops every once in a while to make some snap analyisis of what events mean, but fails to back it up as solidly as a good historian should.Overall this isn't a bad job as an into into Grants life, it's just been done before by better historians and better writers. Read Grant's autobiography, or Catton's books on Grant."
5,Most inspiring book ever read,"This is a book that should be read by young men. It shows that no matter how many times you get knocked down,you always get backup and never stop trying. The story of Grant shows that even the simplest of person can turn out to do great things. I'm sure that this is a book that I will read again someday,his story is that incredible and inspiring."
4,Very readable,"This is a good, clear biography. The author doesn't dive deeply into the tactics in the various battles but gives the reader an understanding of why certain actions and orders were important.Mr. Smith also explains those murky 19th century scandals very well.My reasons for not giving this 5 stars is that there were no pictures (at least in the Kindle edition). I understand that the text is the important part of a biography, but when an author describes a person, and there are photos available, I think some should be included. Often a picture conveys much more about a person than even the best author can achieve.Mr. Smith also gives very little time to General Grant's relationship with Mrs. Grant, a relationship I have always felt was very important and one that I think had more to do with the General's equinimity in battle, both during the war and in politics, than Mr. Smith credits.But all in all a very good bio of one of my favorite presidents."
3,"An OK book, but very dry","This is a plodding look at Grant's life with nothing new in it. It's all been said by better writers and historians than Smith, who has no experience in the politics of Reconstruction or on Ulysses S. Grant. Trust Bruce Catton, no one except Catton wrote about Grant with the same amount of intelligence and knowledge. The chapters on the Civil war in this book are especially basic and contain not one shred or original thinking. There are also a number of mistakes in these chapters.Grant was an intensely interesting and great man. This is a pro-Grant book all the way, but leaves much to be desired."
1,not for 03 chevy tahoe,this product said its for a 03 chevy tahoe but it did not fit at all in either my stereo unit or my truck a complete waste of money!
5,Good product,This product worked as expected with no issues. The part was received quickly and would use them again in the future.
5,perfect fit to my 2000 Chevrolet Cavailer,Arrived on time as instructed. Perfectly fit my Pioneer din stereo. i would recommend this product to others. Installation was easy.
1,Does not fit single DIN aftermarket radios,This product is much to small to fit my single DIN aftermarket Pioneer DEH-1300MP radio. Just go to [...]/ or walmart to find a fit for your vehicle.
3,Not Right For All Vehicles It Claims To Fit,"The ad said it covered 2005 GMC vehicles without excluding any models so I bought this for my Sierra Pickup, it does not fit the full size pickup only the Envoy and smaller. They should be more accurate as to what it fits but the quality is fine so if you can use it you will probably be happy with it."
1,Doesn't fit,"Recently purchased car receiver (standard size) and it had no hopes of fitting, as several people stated. Thanks to Amazon's return policy I did get a refund. First of several hundred Amazon purchase that I ever returned."
2,Opening too small,"The opening is about an 1/8"" too small from left to right, and about 1/16"" too small from top to bottom.I bought this for a Dual XHD 7714 DIN Radio. I am going to have to trim the opening to have any chance of opening the radio's faceplate to get a CD in. I guess somebody forgot to standardize car radios."
1,HA HA HA!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Total crap.Thank god there's only 2 songs here.For more laughs listen to Permission To Land. It's bad 80's metal in 2004.If you like good Rock n' Roll, avoid this at all costs!!"
5,One of the best Blues recordings ever done,"This is my favorite blues CD ( I have more than 400 ! ). Furry's voice and guitar at the best. This record always moves me a lot. This is a solo recording, but sometimes you may swear that there are two guys playing guitar. All tracks are good but John Henry; When My Baby Left Me; Judge Boushay; Casey Jones; Frank and Johnnie and I'll Turn Your Money Green deserve a thousand *stars*."
1,Doesn't work,"I have a Dell XPS PC running Windows XP. I have USB2.0 drives. So this card reader should be plug and play, but it doesn't work at all with my PC. My recommendation is steer clear of this product."
5,SIMPLE FUN GAME,I have played this game and I love it. I know my family will enjoy it too! It's simple and fun. No need for spending time explaining the rules. This game will last somewhere between 2min. to half and hour. Definatly try it!
3,Trump Prices,"The V28 line is fantastic! Before my injury which retired me I used the 28 volt line daily. The 1/2"" hammer drill is simply a beast. In our maintenance dept we tried EVERY brand of cordless tool made and the V28 line smoked every one of them. When you can drill a 1/2"" hole in 1/2"" steel plate it speaks volumes and leaves the other brands( bosch, dewalt, etc) wetting their britches. The only bad thing is the batteries need to be kept under lock and key, maybe with an armed guard because of their cost. Don't let them get cold either, I have learned the hard way that you don't leave them in your unheated shop... I just checked pricing of these batteries and these prices are why I posted a review tonight."
1,MISLEADING REVIEWS!!!,"Like other sites, these M28 reviews are misleading! Most of them appear to review the older V28 battery, not the M28, which is a new replacement for the old one. It is also hard to find in stock at a decent price ($165 is not decent, some sites sell it for $129, but don't have any). Supposedly it has better circuitry to control and protect the battery. So carefully sift through the reviews. The older ones, like 2006,7,8 are obviously not talking about the M28, since I don't think it was manufactured back then. Again, that was the V28...completely different battery, but works with the same tools. How about a little truth in advertising Amazon!"
2,low battery life with radio,"I purchased this battery to go with my new V28 Milwaukee worksite radio. I was expecting this battery to power my radio (only) for at least 20 hrs before needing to be recharged. WRONG !!!! After 8 hours, the battery is dead. Very disappointed ...."
2,the company gets this rating,"My question to you, Milwaulkee, is after the fiasco with your 18 volt batteries, why you don't have a 18v Li-Ion to replace the previous JUNK??You have failed to respond to my e-mails so this is my last resort. To all of you who are considering Milwaulkee cordless tools, do yourself a favor, DON'T DO IT, go with DeWalt Makita or Bosch I am positive u will be happier.........."
1,Milwaukee doesn't care about customers,"I received the battery in time, OK, after chasing the UPS man down the street. So far for the positive part.The package was torn, but the (robust) content was still OK as it was separately sealed in heavy plastic. The shelf-hanging anti-theft type. Don't go with this thing in another store, there's a tag inside the package. Guess how I know...When I unpacked the battery it didn't show anything when I pressed the capacity button. So I concluded the battery is completely discharged. Which usually is a very bad thing for a lithium battery.After this I adessded my concern to Milwaukee tech-support. I user the online form on their website, but never received an answer. The battery still sits on my bench (4 weeks later)."
5,buying another one,I order these for my brother who is in the construction trades. He absolutely gets them cheaper and on time here in florida. good quality-good value. no problem.
4,Battery Charger,"Very nice package, works really good.It was put to work and does a good job as expected.Tankyou very much AAgain."
1,V28 Battery was 3.0 Ah New M28 replacements are 66Wh = 2.35 Ah,"Love my V28 tools but just got 2 new battery's for it.The Ads show V28's but they ship the new M28 replacement battery. They may be fine but they have lowered the power rating on the new battery's.My old ones were 3.0Ah, the new ones are listed as66Wh (to hide the truth I guess)The conversion works out to 2.35Ah, quite a lot lower rating than the original yet they are being sold by part # as direct replacements.Bottom line expect shorter run life than the original."
4,Extra capacity fan box,"This box is higher rated (weight wise) than the other boxes, and had more capacity, which was important given that we were using 12 AWG and had two cables of three conductors each going to the box.Gave it one less star because on this one there's only the single knock-out in the middle - there isn't an offset knock-out like in the smaller box I originally had. The inspector said I could have drilled a hole for it, but I didn't want to compromise the rating in any way (I'm paranoid like that). Otherwise, it's a great, solid box and I have no hesitation sitting under the ceiling fan when it's mounted to this box."
4,A Foreign Field,"This was a pretty good book. I liked the basic story line: a young girl (Ellen) during World War II meeting and falling in love with a young soldier. One thing that kind of made me confused was the nightmare that Stephen, the soldier, has several times throughout the book. It repeats itself nearly word for word during the dream and the waking-up part each time it happens.These characters swear sometimes, but not too much (if you're like me and don't enjoy that, this is just a note...). It's quite a nice book, but I didn't really like the ending very much, or the epilogue. This wasn't because it was poorly written or anything, I just really enjoy happy-happy endings, and this wasn't one of those. Although it is a happy ending in a way, it still wasn't as happy as I hoped it would be."
4,A good story,"I really liked ""A Foreign Field."" I especially liked the poem excerpt that the title came from. The story idea was good: a young girl holding her family together, slowly falling in love with a homesick young pilot. The two start out not even caring for each other, but bit by bit they fall in love. So why only four stars? The story was a very good idea, but felt rushed. The book seemed too short for all the author wanted to say. The chapters alternate, one Ellen's life, one Stephen's letters. At the end, the letters go from one page dated June, the next dated August. It just felt too broad a jump, like some of the suspense was taken out and the story crammed in. However, I did really enjoy ""A Foreign Field"" and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction or historical romances."
5,Purrfect!!!,This is the most amazing fragrance. Light so only the most intimate of friends can enjoy the scent. This fragrance should be called Fenzy by the response it elicits!!!
1,Shuts off after 2 cups out of 10! Sometimes won't turn on,"This is the absolute worst coffee maker out there. It has a manufacturer defect which everyone who purchased it has to suffer through. I will never purchase a Melitta brand product again - a horrible experience, a horrible product."
1,Didn't meet my requirements,the grinder is a pain to clean. After you dump the grouds in the trash you still have to rinse out the remaining ones which go down the drain into the septic system. I programmed it for 0430 and by the time I left for work at 0600 the coffee was only lukewarm. I am going back to the old coffee maker.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money on this coffee maker! The coffee tastes OK and the machine looks good, but it's an over priced disposable product! We used for less than 4 months and it kept shutting off during brewing. I know we should have kept the receipt, etc,so it's our loss but it should have been built better than this.We will never purchase another Melitta.<br />"
2,"Nice design, but died young","The Melitta is a clean-design unit whose carafe does indeed keep coffee hot and drinkable for hours. As others have noted, however, there may be a problem with the relay or sensor that controls water intake to the heating tank. Our machine exhibited signs of brain damage about 15 months into its service life, despite manufacturere-specified cleaning and no abuse. It won't take up the full water supply. Since I can go back to using a reliable Braun unit and simply pour the brew into a separate thermal carafe, I do not plan to make a repeat purchase of the Salton-built Melitta machine."
1,DON'T BUY IT !,I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this coffee maker. I'm shocked that so many people have had the SAME problem that we had with it! It turned off each time it brewed 2 cups so we had to keep turning it back on. The coffee didn't stay hot either. It sounds like the company needs to take it off the market.
1,Only lasted 3 months!,"Mine kept shutting off during the brew cycle after 3 weeks of having it! What a waste of money! It looks nice and it did keep my coffee warm, but when it takes 5+ times of hitting the brew button to make a pot ... I gave up. Do not waste your money."
2,More of the Same,"Most of the time it works well, but just as everyone else is saying, some times it shuts off after brewing 2 cups. It usually starts making puffing or chugging sounds and shuts off prematurely. When it does work correctly, it makes good coffee, but don't rely on the time because it may pull its ""2 cup puff off"" trick."
1,Whew!,"I thought that I was the problem with my coffeemaker. After less than 6 months it has exhibited the same problems that others have described. When you have to leave the house for work at 6:30 a.m. it is not feasible to push the ""ON"" button 6 times! Terrible product!"
5,"Very Nice, but watch out.","I Love my new dishes. They are gorgeous and easy to clean. But beware if you have it shipped. The first time my dishes were shipped, they were listed as broken and returned to sender before they even made it to my city. The second order made it to my door, but one plate and 2 mugs were broken. I would strongly suggest finding a local store and purchasing them there instead of ordering them online."
1,demeaning of India and it's people,"As a Indian settled in the United states, I picked up this book to get an outsider's perspective of India. I am very disappointed after reading through a portion of the book. Ms. MacDonald portrays an incredibly negative picture of India and her stereotyping of all Indians into one not taking into account the rich and vast diversity of everything in India shows her unwillingness to go beyond the superficiality when it comes to researching a subject. Cover depicting lord Shiva in sunglasses also shows a callous disregard for sensitivities of a majority of Indian folks and puts the claims that she has fallen in love with India in poor light."
3,"I bob my head for ""Yes"", ""No"" or ""Maybe""","I have a very mixed feeling about this book. The writerfs quest for the spirituality may have succeeded in rediscovering her own inner-self, but the bookfs attempt to portray India, the people and the religions remains disappointingly superficial. The writing is sometimes hilarious, yet in many cases, it leverages on the stereotypical Western views of India. This is regretful because the writer is not just an amateur traveler, but an ex-journalist who lived in India for two years. Yet I could not completely dislike or dismiss the book, because of the sincerity of the writerfs feeling about everything she experiences. You will probably enjoy the book if you do not mind the stereotype and are prepared to join the writerfs emotional roller-coater ride. I have lived in New Delhi myself, for five years. It amazes me how much it has changed and how much it has not chaged."
3,well written but...,"I must admit I gave up on this book without finishing it-- so that's my disclaimer! It is clearly well written and witty (which I love) although a bit self conscious in the writing style, too. And in the pages I read before giving up, India is portrayed richly--it certainly comes alive. My objection is that the description is so VERY dense that the story, embedded within all that description, moves at a snail's pace. I confess to becoming impatient and irritated because of the tremendous imbalance between description and story. Too bad."
3,Holy Cow!,"It's a nice novel, well written and easy to read but I found it somewhat overindulged and a bit over the top!Good laughs though"
2,Stunningly juvenile,"This is a self-absorbed account of time spent in India. It rates two stars because there are interesting comments about Indian life and culture. There are numerous attempts at humor (sometimes with success), but mostly MacDonald comes off as a chronic whiner. She is Australian, so maybe it is funny to Australians."
2,Too many coincidences?,"On seeing this book I first thought'Wow, this looks awesome.' A travelogue through India and its religions from a neutral perspective. That is until I started reading it. The author has an amazing ability to just land in a place and find that there is a major festival going on. Pure coincidence like she tries to lead us to believe? Hmmmmm. The book in fact appears to have been clearly planned and conceived from before the author even set foot in India. I found a lot of what was written insulting too. The cover shows a disgraceful lack of respect for Hinduism (strange for someone who regards herself as a bit of an expert, which is exactly what is found upon reading the pages too. How can someone pretend to be so open minded and yet constantly criticize many aspects of religious practices, people of all persuasions, and the country itself. Mrs Macdonald clearly would have prefered a colonial style India to suit her colonial lifestyle. In short memsahib Macdonald, this is trite."
2,You need a pen and paper,"I liked the first few chapters, she stayed true to the topic of the book. However, she then delves into (and never gets out of) religion, religion, and more religion. There are also a cast of a thousand characters where I found myself flipping back just to try to remember and place who the person was in the previous chapter/s. Hence the need for a pen and paper. She mentions people once in a chapter then brings them up again several chapters later, so frustrating because I have long forgotten who they were. But really, my gripe is with the writings about religion which I started skipping and finally decided to stop reading the book altogether."
1,A very arrogant writer.,"I found Sarah Macdonald to be way too subjective about India. Her opinions are very Western and feminist and particularly condescending at times. Her descriptions of Delhi at the start of the book just don't add up to reality. Sure it is stifling in summer, but her descriptions of the pollution, sexist Indian men, squalor and low Indian mentality are complete exagerations at best and highly offensive fabrications at worst. She criticises people for not fully following a religion to the letter (the Buddhist monks smoking and eating meat for example), yet her 'investigations' of religions by flitting from one to another and barely scratching the surface of each and then providing a pretentious criticism of what she sees are just galling. Her butch attitude, style (or lack of it) and 'I know best' mentality shows up throughout the book. Definitely one to avoid."
2,This book was Tedious,"I have been to India and I love writing that really puts me in the situation with lots of imagery and words that ""pull"" me into the story.This book didn't do that. I felt that the book was very tedious and was surprised to see that on the cover it told that is it an international bestseller.I didn't view the India that she saw. I think that she wrote from a newpaper standpoint and that was cold hard facts that left out the LOVE and care that the Indian people have to give. I am American and found India a place of care and love but perhaps we see only a reflection of ourselves in what we see and experience. I don't know.There were a lot of facts in this book that would be helpful for a person visiting the country. But to say it was beautifully written and lovingly told is NOT the case.In general I found it tedious and boring."
5,Hilarious,"Great book gives insight to the lifestyle and philosophies within the Indian culture. The book is about one woman's experience living in India. Well written, an easy page turner."
2,Well written trash,"What else would you come to expect from a hippie who views India as a cesspool of drugs and other ways to get high?The sad part is, its morons like this author who use India as an emotional dumping ground and have the gall to complain about a culture that is rich. Ofcourse, we have our own challenges of corruption, greed, crime, by that arguement which country doesn't have? But to be stereotypical of this is not right, as it can have unintentional repurcussions.For example: I remember watching the movie 'Midnight Express' and thankfully i had some turkish friends who set right my understanding and the inherent flaws the movie had about life over there.This book comes of at best as a silly representation of what life is over in India. Yes, there were some chapters and situations that were amusing, but the simple part is, make an attempt at better research of understanding our culture.not surprised that this person is australian.Garbage: 2 stars."
1,Very over-stated and sensationalized,"I bought the book as I thought it would give me good perspectives on a ""white person's"" view of India. But having interacted with very many Westerners who have visited India, I feel that the book is very over-stated in its views and most parts have been sensationalized to make for a good sale.Sarah ends with a view that she eventually experienced a different side to India, however, that premise comes across as quite condescending.I started the book positively and actually enjoyed some situations she presentated, however, came a point when her exaggerations and convenient (mis)interpretations to sensationalize, made me almost ""throw up"" in disgust. I rapidly lost interest in the book thereafter and definitely question its credibility."
4,tail bitten,"Sometimes, bitter-sweet things from the past turn into sweet memories. I saw this book when I was daydreaming of my days in India. Even her overly sarcastic voice didn't annoy me. Her whining was understandable, as I have gone through similar experiences. I enjoyed reading about her journey throughout India, but the last chapter seemed rushed, as if a TV commercial was cued up, so the program had to be wrapped up as beautifully and as quickly as possible. That almost ruined the flow of the story I was reading. Otherwise, it was a fun read."
3,I still want to travel to India but...,"I personally ended up not liking the author after reading this book. It was her soul-search...and she sold it. Very disappointing. I wanted to read more about India and got a lot of religion. Poor author can't decide which religion is right for her. Maybe if she didn't try and answer the big ""R"" question, she would have discovered spirituality on her own. I agree with the other reviewers who complain that all of a sudden, the author LOVES India. After complaining so much, it came as a surprise. In any case, I am not giving less than 3 stars because this book did not make me NOT want to go to India."
3,Holy Cow !?,"After reading this book,I realized that Sarah didnot intend to do this journey for her own improvement or for finding peace or intentionally searching for ""Truth"". Its not actually a travellers log in true sense, Its just a diary of a person who went to India to meet the love of her life. And because, she had to stay back at home while he worked, she started to explore the country where she is made to stay.She started with criticism and disgust and hate for everything . And thats why initailly , you feel let down by her extreme criticism of heat, dirt, slums, poverty and people around .But eventually , you can see a change in her tone, still sharp, but less critical.A traveller doesnot start with critcism and contempt, but infact starts with inquisitivness, surprise and optimism and I think that what Sarah lacked. But her observations were indeed true, no doubt about that.Well and that book cover would definitely be offensive to many!!"
3,Terrorists Don't Meditate For Peace,"Sarah Macdonalds Holy Cow was generally an enjoyable read particularly as she reported her experience withher spiritual journey and the adventures she encountered. Her descriptions of the events, people and environment were colorful, witty and powerful. I thought that she ran into trouble when she gave her commentary on the aftermath of 9/11. She took a decidedly naive opinion as she expressed disappointment that the US reactions was not that of ""forgiveness and compassion"". She also some unflattering remarks aboutPresident Bush referring to him as the cowboy in the White House. Perhaps Sarah would have preferred that the President first conferred with one of her swamis before he decided to take action."
1,"Depressing, snooty book","I started off being very interested and excited about reading this book. Ms McDonald made India sound so colorful and interesting! However barely a few pages in, I learned that India is horrible and its people are savages. Everywhere she went, Ms McDonald only reiterated this fact.This book is also depressing as we follow along on Ms McDonald's journey to discern her own personal 'spirituality'.. read: just another spoiled Gen-X-er who has low self esteem and searches for it via religion. Yawn. You may as well tune into a Real World series on MTV. The content is more stimulating."
1,Outrageous,"This book should be boycotted and no future publishing made public. How dare you humilate someone's God with sunglass? With the current situation, the publisher should be brought with lawsuit. I'd suggest all the Hindus come together and force Mrs Macdonald to change her book cover and go back to the one that's being distributed in UK and Australia."
1,Shame on the cover designer and also the author/publisher,The coverpage must be changed immediately! Shame and pity on all who have allowed the coverpage to be printed.
3,From ipods to sadhus,"Holy Cow is Sarah MacDonald's India travelogue/spiritual memoir, in which she transmigrates from doubt to dharma via dirt, disaster and eventually perhaps a smidge of destiny. MacDonald's a good writer, with an eye for detail and the honesty to admit when she's being selfishly petutlant in her Western ways. MacDonald observations on Indian dating rituals, servants, and religious observances are informative and entertaining - especially the ""blessing of the estrogen"" - I'll spoil it if I tell you any more, but suffice to say be careful of what you wish for!A shout out to the illustrator who drew the cover - a painting of Siva in Christian Roth sunglasses. Absolutely brilliant!"
2,Not that good!,"I've always been fascinated about India, therefore when I started reading this book I thought it would be a heartfelt story of a woman rediscovering herself in this wondrous land. Even thought she begins with a very interesting and captivating prose; but pretty soon you are bored to tears by the triteness of it all. I have many Indian friends, and sometimes her description of Indians and Indian life felt a bit cruel and offending."
2,Could not finish it.,"I love books about Yoga and India. But friends, I could not make it through this one. I didn't care for the style in which it was written. I think if you like the way Stephen King takes 4 pages to describe a rock on the side of the road, you will love this book. I do not."
4,Holy Cow! What an Interesting Book!,"Excellent writing and totally riveting! I'm sorry that some feel that this book is insulting to the country, but honestly, the overall impression I have of India from this book is positive. I do think her forays into ""religion"" were a little bit ridiculous and superficial, but still interesting. I'm sorry that she hasn't written anything else, but understand that she's a little busy in her country of Austalia with at least two young children. I think the cover choice is unfortunate, but doubt the author had anything to do with that. I think it's sad that some chose to leave insulting reviews when they hadn't read the book. You certainly can't understand this book by reading a paragraph, a few pages, or by looking at the cover. I truly don't believe the author intended malice."
2,Don't be in a hurry to Buy this book,"Mere waste of space. Lot of material like coding conventions, we can find in Sun's website. Unnecessary screens occupy most of the space(Funniest thing is it expalins how to set the classpath in windows). Top of all, you cannot do your current project using 1.4. SO wait untill the Sun's next SCJD1.4 comes and then only consider buying this.K P"
3,not that useful,"It is nice book for those who are very beginner in Java programming. Maybe for them this book would be useful if not for preparation of the exam then for some java reading. For folks that have intermediate knowlege of Java, this book is absolutely not needed. You'd better to spend your money elsewhere, honestly.This book does not give you virtually anything, just feeling that you made you first step - started spending money for the expensive exam.I am giving this book 3 stars only on the account that I liked thread examples, they are just funny. Note: I found multithreading issues that arise during the exam preparation being much more complex comparing with how they are illuminated in the book. The book takes simplistic approach to everything.Conclusion: buy, if you have extra money, read if you have extra time. If you don't have either of them - just skip."
3,This book is not enough to pass SCJD,"I bought and read the book for SCJD. However, after I got the assignment from SUN, I found I can't pass SCJD only by using this book because this book just gave me a rough idea and rough sample code about what is SCJD. To successfully pass SCJD, I recommand you go to javaranch.com with this book."
2,Nothing new...,"This book says it is for intermediate to advanced programmers, but the type of information it provides is more for inexperienced programmers trying to figure out where to start. There are better ways to complete the assignment then the solution this book suggests.The bottom line is: this book contains the same type information you can find on the internet. Save your money and research the assignment online."
4,everything a phone should be and nothing it should'nt.,"this is quite a decent little phone. after cingular wanted to jab me in the eye with another 2 year contract to replace my wife's broken and out dated phone (it was less than a year old by the way) I did some research and found this little nugget of frugality. the signal is clear, phone is tiny and screen is clear. And in addition no extended contract or $150.00 upgrade to a cingular endorsed phone. If you want to talk and kill a couple of minutes with it's games this is a great little phone."
5,Wonderful children's book,"I met Belden at a book convention in 1988 (I was 11), and I don't know why I picked this book of all the ones there, but I simply loved it, and cherish it as one of the best reads of my childhood. Just a delight."
2,Not my type of book,"This book has great chapter names. Unfortunately, that's where my enjoyment of the book ended. I didn't like the writing style, the book was hard to read and the characters were not enjoyable or interesting. This was not my type of book."
3,my little girl likes it,My little girl loves painting. I can't seem to pull this product away from her. The colors are very vivid and beautiful. The only thing i dont like about these paints is that after you use them once they get really chunky. all her art had these bill globs all over them. I dont think i'll buy it again but she dosen;t care if there are globs. WE'll keep using it for now but i wouldn't buy this again.
5,"Perfect for Toddlers, Absolutely Perfect",PLEASE read my review for Melissa and Dougs 4pk of Painting Brushes. These paints are so much bolder and brighter than crayola Colors. I believe the chunky texture of the paints has something to do with it being washable. All of the washable paints I have used so far have the same texture. No matter what the manufacturer. But these are the most vibrant. When used with Melissa and Dougs brushes it is a perfect way to introduce your toddler to painting. the Best. Maybe the older kids would mind the texture a bit but toddlers will not even notice. If anything my son likes when the paint kind of chunks a bit and will focus on spreading it out evenly over the paper
1,icky sticky...clumpy,"This is more like Elmer's glue. The paint is really chunky and stringy. The colors don't blend well. I will not buy again, and would not recommend.This is one of the worst Melissa and Doug products ever."
1,Turned to water after one use!,"These finger paints were great the first time we used them - and ONLY the first time. After the first time we used them, we sealed up the jars and stored them in the cupboard. Went to use them again about a week later and they were ALL LIQUID! I couldn't believe my eyes. They were completely useless. If the store where I bought them hadn't gone out of business I would have returned them. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
3,Ok product....,"Pro: WashableCon: Clumpy gel; dull colorsI always made sure I closed the lid tightly. Once left a couple of months untouched, the consistency of the paints changed from the gel into sludgy water. I had to throw them away. Saying that, my son sure did enjoy painting with them! Maybe I just expected a bit more for the price."
1,Terrible Product,"We are HUGE Melissa and Doug fans. This finger paint was great to use the first time. However, the next time we went to use the product, it had ALL turned into this watery mess that was useless. Very disappointed. I will not recommend this product."
4,"Great Production, Despite Changes to Time Period","The Barcelona production is a gem, despite changing the time period from Peter the Great to Russia in the 1950s. The change is especially confusing because Peter the Great is still the tsar during the post-Stalinist period in Russian history in this production. The plot has always been the problem with ""Khovanshchina,"" so I suggest concentrating on the staging and music, especially the choral music.The music is enough on its own to buy the DVD. The staging is wonderful, especially as the climax approaches in the final two acts (acts four and five). ""Khovanshchina"" will never attain the poularity of ""Boris,"" nor should it. But, no not pass this DVD by if you like Mussorsky."
3,+1/2 From the hidden history of female jazz players,"The rise of ""all-girl"" bands in WWII-era America is pretty well documented, with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm being the iconic band of the genre. Less well-known are their British contemporaries, who also took up the slack in the homefront nightclub scene, as the the menfolk went off to war. Bandleader Ivy Benson was one of the most successful female musicians of her time, leading a pretty solid band right up through the 1960s, well after the big band era had collapsed back in the States. These recordings, from 1943-49 singles and radio broadcasts, are not the most dazzling or top-flight dance band material, but they are charming and nostalgic, and capture a nice slice of sweet band history, which would otherwise have slid from memory long, long ago. Certainly worth checking out."
3,"Not the best DL book, but pretty good","Definitely not the best DL book, but definitely not the worst. If you're looking for an amazing, complex plot, skip over this book. The thing that made me enjoy this was Gerard and the supporting characters. He was one of my fave characters from the War of Souls trilogy, and it's cool to see what he did after those books. Pretty well written characters, but no earth shattering plot...but sometimes that's okay."
5,Very nice!,"My son wanted a clone trooper costume to dress up for the Phoenix Comicon, and he loves Star Wars stuff. This clone trooper did the job very nicely. Well constructed with heavy-gauge rubberized plastic armor (not foam as on other costumes), and yet not too heavy so he was still very comfortable. The only issue is the utility belt - way too big."
3,Title Misleads,"The title is somewhat misleading. To me it conveyed, there was information given about using the jeweler's lathe in the pursuit of model engineerig. There was not. The information, while correct and infomative, is no more than a rehash of older works on watchmaker's lathes. If you have never read one of the turn of the 20th century publications, then it will be of value, but if you are expecting some new insight as to it's use, other than horological, this is not it."
3,Chewable pineapple vitamins,"I bought these for my husband who hates to swallow big pills. I tried one and the after taste is kindof weird, so don't eat them if you have nothing to wash it down with. My husband thinks they taste a little weird too, but he still eats one every day. I guess he thinks the funky taste is easier to deal with than swallowing pills."
4,You Better WERK!',"Stephanie does not disappoint. She has all the right moves and GREAT music too! I was jumping around, lifting weights and before I knew it I was in the zone. This isn't a hard core workout, but you will feel it when you are through.My only wish is that her 6round slim down was on dvd."
1,dvd does not work,Just like the other complaints this one did not work -- stayed on the title page. I was really looking foreward to using this too!
3,going for neutral,"I only got through the first 10 minutes of this workout before I had to quit.What I did of the workout was ok --- I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness and this seemed like it would work for me.That said, I could not get past the instructor's voice --- she sounds like she is nervous/trembly when she talks and it just makes me feel nervous and jumpy listening to it. I have quite an extensive collection of workout DVDs that I've kept and more that I've tried and not kept and this is the first one that made me quit within 10 minutes because I just couldn't take any more of the instructor's voice. Rather harsh, I know, so I'll say that other than that, she seems great and others will probably get a good workout."
4,COOKIN',This pot performs well; as good as the T-FAL model I've had for almost 20 yrs. If it lasts as long I won't feel too bad about having paid 4x as much.The only complaint [other than cost!] is the way you have to take the handle off to clean after each use. You've got to have quite stong hands to work it.
5,Love this cooker but...,"I think I would have been just as happy with one that cost a lot less. I do use this often and I find that 4.5liter is a great size for me considering I am usually cooking for two. It is also a good size for preparing side dishes. If you plan to make huge meals like a whole chicken, or if you're cooking for a family, you may prefer a larger pot."
2,disappointed,"I am disappointed in the Perfect Plus pressure cooker. The basket inside it is made of aluminum. I never cook any of my food in aluminum and bought a stainless steel pressure cooker for this reason. Also, it does not cook many food items within the time it says and the number of rings it says to have showing totally is out of sync with what it takes to fully cook anything. Plus, the manufacturer has discontinued this item, so good luck getting replacement parts. I feel I wasted money I could have better spent elsewhere."
3,It is too small,"The quality of this pressure cooker may be very good, but a 4.5 quart cooker is way to small. If you are new to pressure cooking, you will discover this very quickly. I have not had a lot of experience, but I purchased an 8 quart Presto Pressure Cooker for general use and I also purchased a 22 quart Mirror Pressure Cooker for canning within the last year. Both Cookers do a very safe reliable job, are easy to use, and the total cost of both cookers was less than this gold box deal. Please don't spend your money carelessly,"
1,Upset...,"As my first purchase through Amazon, I am very disappointed with the service. I ordered this product on Dec.17th and paid extra for the expedited shipping, guaranteed to arrive by Dec. 24th. This was to be a Christmas gift to my mother before her passing, she loved this book, her original copy that was handed down to her was stolen by someone at her Christmas party last year, she was truly devastated and believed she would never see this book again. It is now Jan. 18th and I still do not have the book I ordered. Amazon showed no empathy when I inquired about my purchase and the fact that it still hasn't arrived is a good indication of the level of service provided to me. Not that it matters anymore as my mother has now passed away and I never got to give it to her. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Great compilation of recipes and stories,"Great book. Gives you a summary of the producers/merchants and then great recipes from those merchants. If you've ever been to the Market, you'll love it."
4,How big is the flat bottom surface ??,"I've been wanting to buy this pan for a while, I have electric range with 7-1/2 burner, I bought a Calphalon 10"" stir fry pan this is less than 4"" in diameter at the bottom, which means 50% of the heat is wasted. I also have skillet that is more than 10"" at the bottom, which is heated unevenly.I am looking for a pan with the bottom surface between 6"" and 8"".Could anyone kind enough to measure the size of the flat bottom of this pan and post it here? Thanks"
3,Just okay,This is a very nice looking pan. A couple of uses were needed to get it seasoned but it seemes to be nice enough. Not incredibly non-stick. Only three stars because only after about 2 months the bottom has warped a little and I'm very fussy about making sure it cools down slowly and not run under cold water or anything.
1,What A Disappointment!,"Received this product today, I was disappointed. The outside was just plain painted metal with a lot of scratches, the bottom was roughly finished. Obviously, this was from Anolon's reject bin. I want to return it to Amazon, but I have to pay for the return shipping. Far from the quality of Calphalon products, just trust CALPHALON!!!"
5,It is a great pan.,I burend the pan with hi temp for about 30 minutes accientally. Guess what?! I can still use the pan. It is amazing. The bottom did not even change shape. I strongly recomment this pan.
4,Great box set,"Unexpectedly this box set is packed with a hard back sized book, an envelope of dozens of little letters, cards, notes, and then the DVD set. I have not had the time to watch the video yet, but I really like the box, book, and memorabilia reproductions. If this is priced at $19.99 or below, you should be happy with this purchase."
4,Love all things Titanic,"I bought this for my nephew because he and I are both fascinated with all things Titanic. I thought it would be a great addition to all of the Discovery Channel specials that were showing during April for the 100 year anniversary. Everything in the set was intersting and fun to look over except for the dvd itself. For the most part, the dvd focuses on a man who was picked to go on one of the diving expeditions but very little time is spent showing the actual dive and the artifacts themselves. What little is shown, is at the very end of an hour long dvd and was disappointing to both of us. All in all, this boxed set is a good value especially at the Amazon price."
3,Documental,"I knew this was a Docummental but I think it should omit the music CD. Its really boring. Anyway, my nephew love it."
4,"Very Nice Set...Poor DVD, however","I love this beautiful set, but if you are buying it mainly for the DVD you WILL be disapointed. It's only around an hour long, and mainly focuses on a guy who won a chance to be part of a History Channel exploration to the wreck moreso than it does on the ship itself. I have seen MUCH better and interesting productions. The box and the rest of the set is very nice, especially the memorobelia reproductions. Buy it and use the DVD as a coffee table stabilizer or frisbee."
2,Disappointed,"First, let me start off by saying this is a very nice collection. The memorabilia packet is especially fascinating. One of the reasons I purchased this is because of the NY Times replica. When I received it in the mail, the replica wasn't in it. I was very disappointed. Amazon did offer to let me return the package, but I decided to keep it, minus the NY Times. However, I have noticed that the NY Times replica has been dropped from the product description now. Other than that, this product is very nice to add to your Titanic collection."
3,This Could Have Been Much Better!,This box set is very nice and filled with great historical memorabilia for the Titanic enthusiast. I do wish that the DVD held a deeper history lesson into the ship other than focusing on Rob Goldsmith's journey to the site. If you're looking for a deep history lesson on DVD of the Titanic this is not what you want. Other than that the rest of the information in this set was well worth the money to me. This is the U.S. version that I have reviewed and to my understanding the U.K. version has the DVD with the in-depth history.
3,worth owning,"California dixieland; which means that while the vocals are primarily for the pleasure of conventioneers, the players attempt to arrange and improvise in authentic style. On a really bad playback device, some of the solos sound like the best of thirties and forties recordings."
4,"FireHouse Plus Two -Dixieland Favorites Sept 11, 2001","One of the great appeals of traditional Dixieland music is the distinct beat obtained by using a banjo and tuba for the rhythm section. ""Modern"" Dixieland bands tend to use drums and base for the rhythm section. The beat just doesn't compare - listen to their rendition of Muskat Ramble where the banjo and tuba will set your feet tapping! Sound quality of this CD is excellent. Highly recommended for Dixieland fans."
4,new orleans music,This was appropriate for party music for a mardigras party. Not enough choices for the type of music i wantd but this was ok
1,lasted just 2 months at 3 hours/day,Recessed ceiling fixture in the kitchen. I have used many CFL bulbs in this position over the past 10 years. They typically last a year or two. This bulb has now set the record for the shortest working life till failure. It was also fairly expensive: $14 from Amazon in October 2010. Draw your own conclusion.
5,Poetic Faith,"Love this book. It is a treasure filled with gorgeous, diverse, and life enriching poems. It reveals the inner layers of faith regarding God, Christ, faith and hope. I initially read this book from a loan at my local library, but I was so impressed that I decided to buy it. Amazon had a copy at a reasonable price at the time so I added it to my collection. I am truly pleased with my investment."
3,Not Topical,"The book fairly explains the complexities of Medicare. However, many changes have been made in Medicare since the date this publication was printed. The book should be updated to reflect the recent changes."
2,this book is not updated for the new medicaid laws,"I took this book out of the library prior to buying it and glad I did. It is not current with current Medicaid rules which seem to be changed every 2 years.VERY IMPORTANT to know what the current dollar figures are for assets, monthly income, etc.I hope the author will update this book however because each state sets their own rules for Medicaid that will probably not happen.What the authors COULD DO is have each states current financial guidelines available online and have the book set out what legal stategies are best overall."
2,Outdated,The book came quickly and the price was right but the information was out dated medicaid laws are constantly changing and differ from state to state but I found after working with a medicaid planning company that there are alot of things the book didnt know about
3,Something missing,"Maybe it's just because there's a time warp between when John Newton wrote his letters and the present day, but I felt a little disappointed in reading his autobiography. As if the real feeling was missing. It felt like a record of events without the emotion that must surely have accompanied those events.Full credit to Dennis R Hillman, without whose footnotes I would've missed a lot of innuendo.Very well done, an incredible story, but next time I'll read someone else's account of Newton's life."
2,Lame,Where's the 5.1 surround mix? Anyone with a home theater setup will be disappointed by the 2-channel audio. Not to mention the video quality could be a lot better. At one point during Dead Skin Mask I thought something was wrong with my TV. Skip this and get Still Reigning instead.
3,Meh...good background stuff if you're having friends over,"Just snagged this today (watching Slayer's set as we speak). I'm a big Lamb of God fan so seeing the guys who went onstage right before Slayer getting a measly one song on the dvd upset me a bit, but hey, if I want LoG, I have their own dvd. The track listing of the dvd aside, the footage of this is mediocre at best. As the other guys here stated, a lack of 16:9 and better audio playback options suck. My household is still without any HD/ Dolby surround sound, so if you live in a similar situation, the technical aspects wont bother you too much. Thank god the bands on this dvd all had tight sets cause thats what saves it from some lousy camera work."
1,Too small for the price,My 4 year son did not enjoy. He no longer playing with it. And broken on the first day of play. To small for the price.
4,Far fetched story line,"I know people have one night stands all of the time, but with the intent purpose of getting pregnant? I thought the set up to the story was a little far fetched, but once it got started and the characters began to be developed it was a good read. I am so glad that Will was a stand up guy. Kudos for someone doing the right thing and just wanting to help out. Good romance. Hot scenes! Nice comfy Saturday read."
3,"Good, but definately not Booker's best","If you are looking to buy some Booker T. and the M.G.'s. which if you haven't, you should, this is not the place to start. This poor compliation does not even include Melting Pot, nor Soul Limbo, Hip Hug-Her, Chinese Checkers (not a smash but a classic anyhow) or even Green Onions or Time is Tight for God's sake! Their signature songs! If you are really interested in the band, the greatest instrumental group of the sixties, then you should look into buying Rhino's thoughtfully compiled Time is Tight boxed set, or their albums Green Onions, Hip Hug-Her and Melting Pot, the best three they have to offer. The Rhino Best of.... is also far superior to this. My guess is that the label compiled what songs they could get for a cheap price that had recognizable names. That is the only excuse for such an incomplete collection. Definately not poor quality music, but really there's no reason for this album to exist."
4,Good Product,"Used this kit to make my second attempt at Tamales. The pot was plenty big, the only thing the kit was missing was some string to tie up the tamales and a recipe would have been nice. Overall I am very happy with this product."
2,A Surd jumping up & down,"Personally, I don't like the Album or the songs. I hear Punjabi to a subustantial extent, but this is one album that I find silly and illogical."
5,balle balle,I t was grat to hear from Daler Sahab after such a long time . He has the power to attract a large crowd in no time. Enjoy!
1,music quality,I think daler mehandi is finished with originality & his music is just the old beat. Plus the experimentation with sufi style does not seem to be appropriate in time as it could be done after some years. I think he dominated the world of pop & he should still stick to hisoriginal style & not jump to experimenting.
4,mast for all ages,a CD which will appeal to people of all ages and tastes. it makes your foot tap and set your mind and body for dancing like a maniac. i feel that this is a CD which will make you go mad with excitement. i hope daler will keep on giving us this kind of music over and over again.
2,Where's my refund?,Advertises wrong picture which misled me. I did not use sny and returned it a long time ago and am still waiting on any info of my refund.
3,Images From A Bygone Era,"Where to start? This is almost a wordless book filled with 145 glamour shots from the ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood. I would say that the book is a work of ""art"" and contains the work of many masters of still photography of the era. Some of the photos are truly stunning an deserve to be shown in the top Museums in world. The book uses high quality, acid-free paper and strong binding that enhances the book as a collectable. It would make a nice piece to anyone's collection of art books and you will page through it every so often. The reason that I did not give the book a higher rating is because it is quite short, it's a paperback and does contain many average works (in my opinion).My personal favs were: Carole Lombard, Jean Harlow and Louise Brooks.thank you for your time, David"
4,It's a keeper,I am glad I have this book and it's a must-have. The collection of photos are wonderfully dramatic. I only wish it was a hardbound book.
5,Amazing Book !!!!,All I can say is WOW to all the beautiful portraits in this book.This book will be enjoyed by anyone that loves the Glamorous actors & actresses of the past.You won't regret this purchase.
5,Interesting production from the male jazz pop voice of Iran,"This was Viguen's last production before his passing away in October 2003.The song ""Baazgasht (return)"" is a luxurious production that has real acoustic drums and guitars. It has been nicely engineered and sounds fantastic. His voice fits perfectly, the melancholic song. The lyrics are perfect for being one of his last recordings, since they give a nice retrospective on the significance of this goodlooking male singer for pop music in Iran."
1,Diverse heritages? I beg to differ!,"I was very excited to be reading this book, for a women in literature class. But as I got into the poetry I was greatly upset that they poems focused on ""SPANISH"" what about, french, celtic, polish, italian,etc. I was not impressed by the way the poems were expressed collected."
1,coating came off,Anolon not impressed with the coating came off in no time didn't cook evenly I through this away long ago
2,Disappointment,"I received my pan as a wedding gift a little over a year ago. I also received the set. I have not had any problems with the set, just this pan. The non-stick coating is not working anymore. In the warranty it states that this can happen with too high of heat- how do you cook on your stove with too high of heat? I also bought a lid for the skillet and it does not fitwell. I need a new skillet. This one is just a big disappointment."
2,"Nonstick, but coating can be scratched off easily!","I have been paything hundreds of dollars trying to find a wok like cooking utensil but I've yet found one. This one looks good with so many good ratings but it has a lethal flaw: its nonstick coating can be peeled off by anything -- a turner or simply a spoon. So, why do you throw in so much money to buy something that can cost your health in the near future? You might get canser if you eat those coating chips."
4,Rounded bottom not necessaily good...,"This is the second skillet I have owned in this line. The first one had more ""floor space"" but my teen-age daughters (and myself)didn't protect the non-stick coating from metal utensils, etc., and it soon became unusable due to peeling (costly mistake since I paid considerably more for it at a department store!). I liked the straighter sides on the first one because it allowed for more cooking room on the bottom. This skillet, despite its rounded bottom, is still one of my favorites. And the good news? The glass dome lid from my previous 12"" skillet fits it perfectly!"
4,great!,"This is a great CD, but my boyfriend said that one of the Staple Singers big hits was ""Oh Happy Day."" He said that it was made in the early 60's. He can't find it anywhere. Where is it? Is it available on a different CD?"
1,Case was poor fit,The case was too narrow and the visor edge wouldn't fit right. Surprising since other Rhinoskin products were just fine.
4,"Good, but read the text first","This is a good play, with early Olivier, but Rosalind can be a bit difficult to understand if you don't already know what she's saying. Lighthearted Shakespeare."
3,BLACK AND WHITE SHAKESPEARE,"Sometimes bizarre rendition of Shakespeare's comedy with a very young Laurence Olivier. The forest scenes are the best with very wild animals tramping across the camera eye as if they just escaped from a zoo. The film is old, creaky and sometimes inaudible but that is part of it's charm. Elizabeth Bergner's closing bit in the epilogue is very lovely."
2,"Not so good , Rosalind is Horrible","Olivier is the only good actor. Stewert is good when she is Aliaina but would have been a better Rosalind than Bergner. It was hard to tell why Duke Fredrick was mad. The reltionship between Phebe & Silvius wasen't there it seemed their lines were cut out . I have played Silvius before, and this one was Boring! You could easly fall asleep."
2,Not extroidinarily impressed,"I thought As You Like IT was somewhat disappointing and slow. Having loved the play, and put on the performance as Rosalind, I thought Bergner's impression was not great, and she was not convincing."
3,LB EVANS SLIPPERS,"Nice slippers, but run small. Bought for my husband at a size 14, did not fit him but fit my son who wears a 13-13.5"
2,good quality but wrong size,I HAVE ORDERED TWO OF THESE ITEMS FOR MY HUSBAND. THEY ARE PRETTY NICE QUALITY BUT THE SIZE OF THIS PRODUCT IS TOTALLY WRONG. HE WEARS SIZE14 SO I DID ORDER HIS SIZE BUT HE COULDN'T EVEN PUT HIS FOOT IN.THEY ARE LIKE SIZE12 AND VERY VERY NARROW SO I ENDED UP WASTING MY MONEY SINCE I LIVE IN OVERSEA AND IT IS NOT EASY TO SEND IT BACK.
2,Not Happy with this product,"These slippers are suppose to be extra wide according to the sizing chart, but they are not. As I sit here writing this review, I'm wearing them. And they pinch my toes and are not comfortable at all to wear. Really bummed out about this purchase and that now I have to go through the hassel of returning these. The only reason I don't give these a one star is that despite the fit, these are made out of decent materials for the price."
2,Poor quality,I purchased it three years ago and used it lightly (is it one of several pairs of slipper I've been using). It started to come apart. For the price I paid I have expected somewhat better quality.
2,product returned,"I returned this product since the size did not agree with American sizing. In short, the slippers didn't fit."
2,lb evan slippers,"Current product does not match the quality of same item bought two years ago. The top of the slipper not as flexible and therefore has a tendency to ""cut"" into the top of ones foot after wearing for a length of time."
1,The most uncomfortable slipper or shoe I have ever owned,"I just received the slippers today. The label sewn on the ball of the foot is arrogance gone to seed. The stiching on the label and the leather stitching in the arch support hurt my feet so much that I can't wear the slippers!!!! I'm really disappointed because instead of a much needed slipper I will probably have to throw them away. This is the first negative product review I have ever written. The product materials and construction are beautiful, but to what purpose?"
2,Not true to size. Too small for size 11,"Nice appearance, but too small for the size. I ordered size 11, which is my husband size, and it was really too small. He could not use them."
1,Bad Idea,Only good if you are only going six feet or less; will not stay on your feet. Either buy the ones with an enclosed heel or use flip flops.It's a real comedy if you are moving a piece of furniture and you are the one walking backwards. These now belong to my new puppy. They are nice leather and make great chew toys.
2,LB Evans slippers are allergic to any drop of water,"Although very comfortable, the ""Black Leather"" description of this product is misleading, since it is ""black painted"". When in contact with any, even minimal, amount of water, it looses black paint which will be quickly absorved by a rug or carpet ...."
1,Disappointing in many ways,"Where do I begin? First, I ordered EEE width (wide) and followed the suggestion to order a half size larger than normal. The slippers are much too narrow. As a diabetic, that is a major problem. Maybe feet are narrower in China where these over-priced slippers are made! Second, the padding in the heel is not very comfortable. Third, the bottoms are really not non-skid. Etc. Not recommended at any price!"
2,False Advertising,"Unfortunately these slippers in real life were NOT anywhere near the size that they were advertised to be. They were supposed to be EEE and the slippers were labeled as such, however they were just like regular medium sized slippers. I had to return them as my father could not get his feet into them at all. Very disappointed."
3,"Great product, not so great price.","Five stars for the sugar itself. It can be substituted 1:1 for ""regular"" sugar. Some other organic sugars have a higher moisture content which can cause problems when baking. It's not cost effective buying the case of 1 lb bags, however, even compared to the big ""natural"" food grocery chains. Why doesn't Amazon sell cases of the 4 lb or 10 lb bags, with their lower price per pound?"
3,Bigger bags!,"Yes, I agree with the reviewer that wants the bigger bags. Less wasted packaging and presumably a better price."
5,Organic Sweet Deliciousness!,"Unlike some other ""natural/organic"" sugars I've tried in stores, the flavor of this sugar is amazing. I love the 12 individual packages and the fact it's not at all clumpy."
5,Tastes great and works well.,"We don't use white sugar and have always purchased cane sugar from a co-op which became inconvenient. Was glad to find many organic/natuaral products on Amazon. I had been purchasing the Billings cane sugar which was less expensive and I loved, but it is no longer available through Amazon. This has been a good replacement."
5,perfect,"Can't get much better - organic sugar at terrific prices. I buy this all the time. You can't go wrong with avoiding poisonous industrial waste pesticides that the Republicans want you to eat, and don't care if they make you bad. Stick with organic and vote Democratic Majority so we can get back America out of the Stone Age! POWER TO ORGANIC"
2,"Like the idea of the product, but produces a bumpy finish","I have been purchasing several varieties of this brand of sugar for sometime, but I have found the powdered sugar product less and less acceptable. It clumps. This requires the extra step of sifting the sugar, several times and then throwing quite a bit out. I am just tired of having a lumpy finish to my frostings, especially after all the extra effort I seem to be going through. Until they can provide a more consistent product I guess I am going back to Dixie Crystal. Bummer."
2,A refreshing drink,"I'd not heard of Orangina until recently. I found it a refreshing drink, although, a bit pricey making it a nice treat but probably not an every day event."
3,"Great Item, but not the place to buy it...go to TRADER JOE'S","Orangina is my favorite drink of all time, and i average at least a bottle a day, but $11.05 is an outrageous price for four glass bottle. If you go to any Trader Joe's they sell the same four pack for $3.98"
5,Love it,"I had this before and it literally fell apart with age and with the fierce Las Vegas heat, cold, and wind. I was so happy to find this, my mom had it, and loved it so much, she wanted to go to the hardware store and cut another one out. Glad I found it here and ready to go."
1,Not even close to what I wanted...,I ordered plugs and wires for a 2009 Toyota Camry. The package arrived and it has a large label that says it is for a GMC/Chevrolet 5.7 V8. It includes all 8 wires (but I only need 4 hmmmm?) That's great but I used Amazon's part finder for a Camry and this is what it came up with. WTF??? I even went back to check and it's still listing that this part will fit my vehicle.
1,Wrong Part for 1996 Camry 2L 4Cyl,Just had to return these - i got a set of wires for an 8 cylinder GMC Chevy instead ... part number does not match up with the application guide on the Bosch website ... waste of time ... have to send back !!! Amazon really messed up this order today!
5,Beetoven would be humbled.....,"Rich Smith is a genius with a heart of gold and both qualities can be easily heard if you listen to ""The Giant Forest."" My only challenge with his CD is that I occasionally have to buy a new one because I play it so often. The fact that Rich improvises so much of his music blows my mind away because every note he plays sounds incredibly well planned and richly practiced. The Giant Forest (in addition to anything else Rich produces) is truly candy for your ears."
4,Very cool music,"I first bought this cd at Starbucks because I liked one song I heard playing in the store, ""Goodnight Moon"". To my surprise, the whole thing is really good! In fact there's only one song on it that I don't like. I lost my first copy of it, or it was taken; it mysteriously vanished. Starbucks didn't sell this one any more in their stores, so I hunted it down and finally found another. It was worth the effort. It's become one of my favorite cd's, and whenever I play it with my friends around, they always ask, ""What's that you're listening to?"" It doesn't take long for it to grow on you. Really good, definitely one of Starbucks best compilations."
4,great for cooking,I'm using this pot for rice cookingIt takes less than 10 mini and the quality is goodI like it~
5,PS-1-derful,Sparkling technique combined with lyrical composition make this a truly great 'find'. Perfect for relaxing evenings or lazy afternoons.
1,Oldie Moldie,"Why is he bumble fumbling around on his guitar. My Dad played his old Mahavishnu records and this sounds like he is asleep.Maybe his son if he has one could play better.This stuff makes me want to go to sleep.All the reviews sound like they were by people that listend to him for too long! and are fooled like the emerpiors new clothers.Thank you, \Megan"
3,"Items sent, but not all the same as purchased","I was not happy that I recieved different scents than what was ordered. Obviously, the seller felt it was ok to just go ahead and substitute. Not ok, fragrance sent is awful!"
2,need to state age recommendations!!!!!!!!!,It would probably be great if it wasn't too advanvced for my 4 yr old. You need to stat what age your toys are recommended for.
1,no thank,I was very displease with this cd it want play in my car all the other that i order play what is wrong with this one
5,A must have for all R & B fans everywhere.,"Few people realize that Johnnie Taylor was a Sam Cooke protege. After Sam left the gospel group ""The Soul Stirrers"", he hand picked Taylor to take his place. It was a great choice. He not only filled some pretty big shoes, he went on from there to do a great job in the R & B field. I would recomend this album of hits in a heartbeat."
4,magic beans!!,i received my magic beans and planted them immediately. nothing was out of order with the packaging or the shipment time. i can't wait to see the messages!!!
2,cheap clamp,I can say it's cheap. that's about it. it won't clamp down well and it can slip under pressure. Spend a few more and get a better quality clamp.
1,Drops Signal/Poor Customer Service from XM,"We had this radio for about 6 months, when it completely quit working. During the 6 months the reception would go in and out, until finally the radio wasn't transmitting anything. To troubleshoot, we tried the Pioneer satellite radio that my husband has, and it works great in my car. So, I know it was not my car radio receiver or antenna that was the problem. Getting XM to help us with this was like pulling teeth! We originally contacted Delphi, and they told us to call XM. We kept getting the run around from XM for over one month, until they finally told us we needed to call Delphi for warranty refund! A big circular mess... Our opinion is to spend the extra money and get the Pioneer radio."
5,Great item but read description carefully,"This product has worked very well but you have to read the description very carefully, it does NOT come with a home docking station, you have to purchase this seperatly. Once you get the home docking station, it is very easy to set up. I did have one question and had to call tech support, they were very helpful. This receiver works well in the house and in the car."
3,"Long in the tooth, still sounds good","Ok, the SkyFi2 is getting old, but it still works just fine. The display shows it's age with large pixel text, it's a bit bulky, it's thicker than it might appear in the photos, but if portability isn't a big issue for you, then this is a really cheap way to get XM for yourself. The sound is just fine, the features are actually very nice, the newer units don't have that much on the old SF2, especially if you set up in one place and leave it. I purchased this for a friend, along with a home kit, and the signal repeater, all together, for less than most of the recivers alone."
2,poor reception in mountainous areas,"Purchased this satellite receiver to use at a vacation home in the mountains of southern california. I already own a 4+ year old delphi roady that had no issues in this regard, but decided to get a second receiver so I would not have to transport the roady back and forth from my home to the mountains and it always received a great signal from the satellite. The new receiver was incapable of even being able to locate or load the signal in order to activate an additonal account with xm. I activated the device in town without difficulty but as soon as I moved it back to the mountains, no signal could be found. NOT RECOMMENDED for anyone who needs good satellite reception in mountains. BE WARNED that xm customer service is not helpfull or forthcoming with issues related to placement of this receiver."
4,Pleased with Sky Fi 2,"Delphi did pretty well with the design and operational logic on this receiver. The display is big and clear, controls are simple and not crowded together like the itty bitty bead buttons you see on a lot of modern electronics. Menus are reasonably intuitive too. My only (small) complaint is rotating the dial moves the display cursor in the opposite direction you would expect."
5,The Best For XM!,"This receiver has 3 preset channels A,B &C; with 10 channel settings on each. It also has direct tune feature.You can scroll through the channel settings with the remote or the dial on the receiver itself.You can go back for the last thirty minutes of programing & play it again if you really like it or you were out of the room & missed it.I have three of these & REALLY LIKE THEM!"
2,Not a bad unit ...,"... if price was completely taken out of the equation. Nice big display, fairly easy to install, (((XM)))'s service (in my opinion) is second to none. There's a lot of good here, just not at seventy-dollars. Quite honestly, that's just FAR too expensive.You would do better to either examine the used items being sold here, or take the money you would've spent and purchase the XpressR from Delphi. For a comparable price (I think the R is about ten or fifteen dollars more) you'll get a current unit with TONS of features and twice as many accessory options.Highly recommend the service, but your money would be better well spent on a different, i.e. more current, model.UPDATE: This unit is currently marked at the $55 Range ... this would qualify as a price I'd consider to be completely reasonable and a good value."
4,SkyFi2 WM Radio,"The radio works great, strong FM transmitter, I enjoy the multiple line display. The pause feature is great but, if you want to backup to hear something you missed on a news channel, it skips back to a pause in the programming and you may go back 5 or more minutes. Though this works great for songs!! The docking station is quite large and creates a problem finding a good mounting location.Overall I am very pleased with the radio, I have had it a few weeks and no issues or problems."
4,Where's the beep?,"I really like the SkyFi2. I had a Roadie before this and the SkyFi2 is a vast improvement. However, the Roadie had loud beep that came over the speakers when one of songs was found playing somewhere. The SkyFi2 does not send the beep sound over the speakers; it comes from the SkyFi2 and is not loud enough to hear. So, I miss a few favorites."
5,Gotta be the best there is!,"OK, I am on my second SkyFi2 receiver. One is now in each pickup. No complaints after 18 months of daily use. If you want XM raido in your vehicle (or house...I also own the home adapter), this is the receiver to use. I've installed each one in slighlty different vehicles in less than 30 minutes each. It took that long because I am meticulous. I mounted one on a 2x4 pedestal and inserted it into the console tray on the floor. The other I attached directly to the dashboard. You cannot go wrong with this device!"
4,If you don't have satellite radio I would reccomend it,I don't know what I did before satellite radio. With this one you can play the song over if you like it. The only bad thing is...if you happen to catch the song towards the end...you can't replay the song from the beginning. The memory only remembers the music you heard. I don't think you will be disappointed...with so many channels to choose from...there is always something good on. :)
1,I wouldnt recommend this unit,Ive had this unit for over a 1+ year and ran into problems with reception it would drop signal and it would eventual come back. I found out that this unit had a defect and the xm rep said I could get a replacement for $50!!! They didnt figure to tell anybody about this? If this is true I would not recommend XM Radio at all.Thanks John
4,good item,"Although the item clearly had a ""used"" look, it works great and arrived quickly. I'm pleased!"
3,SkyFi2,"Although the SkyFi2 receiver works well, it is older than we expected. It was listed as an ""open box"" item, which I always thought was a new item and basically unused. However, this receiver was obviously old and well used. However, it does fill the need we had for a working XM receiver, so we are basically OK with it, if a bit disappointed with its' age."
2,Fits Small,This sweater cardigan is made very nice. Pretty buttons and fabric not to heavy. However it fits way to small. lacked several inches from closing. I had to return it no small issue since requires customs!
1,Biased and under-researched,"Anyone who has read Casey Tefertiller's thoroughly researched and objective book will find Horan's take on Wyatt Earp unrecognisable. This is a completely one-sided, selective and unconvincing version of history."
5,Removable cleaning handle is the only way to go.,"The removable handle is the best. It makes cleaning that way it should be. And the fully sealed pressure system, with gauge, take less energy than the old ""rocker style"" I grew up with. Wonderfully simple, bring the thing up to pressure, and then just put it on the lowest burner setting (doesn't take much to keep pressure)."
3,Rat bait mildly successful,"Bought this after reading a bunch of reviews and after having a serious rat/mouse outbreak. Granted our problem got bad, but for the first two weeks, they just ate this stuff like candy and I never saw a dead rat, never noticed a slow down in droppings, things being eaten in the garden or rat sounds at night.Two weeks later, the number is definitely down and the problem is back to under control, but I've used probably 2/3 of the bait (that big tub). I put out the bait every night where I know they live and travel, it's gone every morning, but it sure isn't fast acting or over-performing."
3,The Rats really enjoy this product,The rats and mice are certainly enjoying their fill of this product.I have no idea if if this product works to kill vermin. No bodiesany place and plenty more to eat every load I put out.
2,Racoon loves these,Loaded up bait stations near my deck with the bait chunks. Not sure if any mice had a chance to partake but a Racoon has certainly been feasting. Found the bait stations pulled out of the ground upside down. Doesn't seem to effect him either.
5,Wonderful TomCat bait,This bait is the best anywhere that I've found. I have gotten several peopl using them because they had given up on other brands of bait as they did nothing to help them with their rodent problem. THIS STUFF WORKS. Only have only problem. Large rats carry the entire chunk off to somewhere--hopefully it is home so the rest of the family will help them enjoy. It can get expensive when every couple days all the bait chunks are gone and you have to put out more. BUT IF IT DOES THE JOB WHO CARES!!
2,Will not kill poison resistant rats and mice.,"Apparently there are mice resistant to anti-coagulant based poisons. I'm still researching and trying to find an alternative, but this poison uses Diphacinone as it's active ingredient, and it simply will not kill some mice.I only suspected this was the case when I was 3/4ths the way through a bucket of the stuff and still hearing them partying in my walls."
5,Great Product,"We use this bait around our home in the country, we rarely see a mouse or any other creature around our house after using it. I place the bait and by the next morning it is usually gone, so I place more until the baits stop disappearing so quickly. We have used it for two years now."
3,Great hawthorn,"Helped my heart beat stronger so I did not get dizzy. Without it, every time I stand up I feel so dizzy I have to hold on to something."
4,Usual good Circulon quality,"I've got a Circulon set I've used for a couple of years. I began collecting individual inexpensive pieces several years ago because I liked their looks and the ones I had worked well - the non-stick coating and the ridges are great!So far, every one of my 20 or so pieces has held up very well, no peeling or sticking, and I've been very happy with my Circulon and it's durability and looks. I ordered this skillet because my family wanted a size between my smaller 9"" and larger 12"". I'm happy with it and would give it 5 stars if only the sides were a little higher - I have been using an old iron 10-1/2"" skillet and like the depth for cooking one pan meals. This skillet is shallower and won't hold as much, so it is definitely just a ""skillet"" for frying. You'll need one of the other pieces for one pan meals."
5,Buy with Confidence!,"I simply won't purchase or use another product than Circulon...I have to speak UP! I read a review here from a person who stated that this product does not hold up to use and wears out quickly. I don't know what they are doing to their pans, but be assured, they simply do not wear out without extremely abusive use! I have had these pans for nearly 10 years, and though they look used and worn, they just work..there is no sticking and they heat evenly. I love them now as much as I did when I bought them. You won't be disappointed in the product, and it is priced in a range that most people can afford. I have a piece of circulon in almost every size they make, and I will keep buying them because they are simply the most functional, and decent priced pans on the market. With a little care these pans will last you a long, long time. I am old enough to remember scrubbing and scrubbing on stainless steel pans, so I am really spoiled with these wonderful nonstick LONGLASTING pans!"
3,Great while new,"I have a full set of circulon products, and have had them for several years. While this cook ware was new, it was wonderful. I'm not so sure about a lifetime of use though. Over a period of time, the interior of this cookware does begin to wear and over a period of time it does begin to stick. I do a lot of cooking and am now in search of something that will really last. If you are an occasional cook and not overly experienced this cookware is absolutely wonderful. I loved it in the beginning. Nothing stuck to it and is very simple to clean."
1,good for a short time,"I had this product for two years. It worked well (non-stick) for a while, then the top layer on the bottom started to peel off."
2,Short lifespan.,"I've gone thru TWO Circulon skillets and they are great when they are new, but the nonstick quality fades after a few months. If you are a serious cook, spend a bit more and invest in higher quality nonstick cookware that will last. I switched to AllClad nonstick and am very pleased (so far)."
1,Item was damaged,"I received this item damaged. The handle was cracked down the middle. I did not replace it with the same item because I thought if it could be damaged like that when it was packed so well, what would happen in my kitchen?"
5,My First and still favorite Rory cd,"This was my first Rory album I ever bought. I remember buyingHis whole catalog for 1.99 each in the cut-out bin at my local record store.Follow Me could have been an FM rock hit, The album is packed with Rockin Rory Gems, and I think this is still is most catchy album.I love all of Rory's stuff, but this and Calling Card and perhaps photo finish will always be my favorites.Rory is long gone now ,but his music will live forever.There is this new guitarist out named Victora Warne who sounds a lot like Rory and did a cover of Follow Me on her LiveAt The Savoy Cd. Definetly worth looking into !!!"
3,Rory Gallagher...the unsung guitar hero,"Rory Gallagher absolutely tears it up on this disc. This one has a lot of my favorites...especially ""Bad Penny"", ""Philby"" and ""Keychain"". No one ever ripped it up on a Stratocaster any better than Mr. Gallagher. Buy this CD and enter Irish blues valhalla. A friend of mine calls Rory ""the one man Led Zeppelin"". I think I'd have to agree..."
5,Very faithful to the book.,"I was particularly pleased to see how well the film accurately portrayed the author, a martial artist in the true sense of the word. If anything, I would have liked to have seen the film be longer. George I. Martin, Ed.D. (3rd degree black belt, TKD)"
2,Does not taste like brown sugar & Hard as a brick,"This does not taste like any brown sugar I have had in the past, it just was not very good. Also it was as hard as a brick I have to used a knife and chop it up every time I want to cook witch it just to get it in the measuring cup. It's impossible to ""pack"" it in the measuring cup once you finally get it there. Makes a huge mess. Disappointing."
2,Dries Out,"I ordered this product with high hopes, but when I got it, all the brown sugar was very dried out. Even though I rehydrated it according to the directions on the bag, it just dried out again. Storing it double bagged did not help either."
5,Beautiful,"How anyone can write such fun tropical songs and then write the most beautiful song, along with Song for Ireland by Mary Black, your song Legacy of Love, I don't know. I hope Liz O'Connor that you get as famous as your friend Bill Jabanoski. You deserve it because this Cd is either great fun or goes right to your heart. I just hope you don't get there before my next vacation in February. I'm sorry. But I missed Bill Jabanoski before he got big and if your still playing in Captain Tonys down in Key West everyday I'd love to listen to you and meet you. This is a beautiful and very fun Cd. I wish I had the talent to express myself the way you do."
4,Nancy Drew comes to Ireland,"I read this book out of curiosity as I live in the Irish village of Ballyhooly in County Cork where the story is set. As a murder mystery, it's very Nancy Drew but very readable nonetheless. For anyone familiar with Ballyhooly and its hinterland, the descriptions of the key landmarks are still very accurate today, 32 years on. Any Betty Cavanna fans are welcome to stay at our Bed & Breakfast, The Old Train House B&B. www.oldtrainhouse.comBilly Mulqueen"
4,Unique & Absorbing,"I liked ""Blue Ride"" a lot. As I read, I felt like I'd entered another world, away from the crowded cities, television and popular culture. The stories actually do--as the book cover states-- ""emerge from the desert roads and outback towns of the American Southwest"". The author has revealed the marrow of an uncommon life in the Southern California Badlands."
4,RhinoSkin Leather Flip Case,"Good product. Other reviewers have stated that the clip broke for them. I have not had that problem. They may have fixed it. The metal spring goes all the way to the bottom of the plastic part of the clip so the plastic should not break now due to the stress of the spring. This case is probably the best belt clip case out there. It is not nessary to be wearing a belt to carry this around, it will clip your pants. It is fairly easy to get off the clip and use. You can also remove the Palm Pilot from the case it self since it is a holster type of case and not one where the Palm is afixed to the case. Overall it is a good product. I would like to have seen a simlar case that is not made from leather to get the price down, after all this case is a 1/3 of the price of the m100."
2,Design Problems,"The very first day the clip broke. Service was good and Rhino shipped two new ""improved"" clips the very next day. Unfortunately the pocket in the back where the clip slides into is breaking down allowing the clip with the post to fall out of the holder, dropping the whole unit to the ground. Urghh, considering this is one of the most expensive holder you can buy I expected far less problems if not problem free."
2,Poor binding,"I appreciate the timing of the shipment however as I read the book, every time I turn a page, the previous page comes out so as I am reviewing I have to be careful to keep the pages together and in order. Unfortunate since it was a new book and I will need to reference it over the next year which will prove frustrating with all loose pages."
2,Avoid,"This record has very few Albert KIng hits, most of it are rather not very known numbers as well as few obscure covers. If you want a best of by Albert King, pass this one by. How can a best of of his exclude As the years go passing by, The Hunter, Oh pretty woman, Laundromat blues, I'll play the blues for you or Cadillacassembly line? And that's just a few. to name.I would give it only one star but gave one extra because of my admiration of this man's best work. This, however, doesn't come even close to it."
5,A Must Have for the New Millenium!,"This CD focuses on torquing emotive forces to the nth degree, oscillating between the melodramatic and the earnestly humorous. You'll laugh while crying. You'll want to watch Hayley Mills movies while listening to the Durutti column. Take out your 'popscene attire'. Get ready for the sweet and spicy. You'll wanna go out for Thai food because of it."
1,The Mask is way to big!,"The Mask is way to big! and the nose and mouse holes are very bad cut not a very good shape of the holes,amazon was very good on my refund."
5,HUGE Sturdy Messenger Bag,"It is your classic bike messenger bag with a water proof liner sandwich between a nylon inner lining and a extremely tough outer shell. This was the 2008 model and several vendors still carry it. The 2009 model is available with a Milwaukee logo on it. The third leg strap helps stablize the bag on your body when you have it fully loaded. You can sling it either left or right shoulder. Go to the Crumpler website for instructional and amusing videos on bag carry and contents. It also demos the 3 smaller personal gear pockets and the zippered folder size pocket. Though pricey the bag will last forever unless you're a professional bike messenger; you can buy one every year and declare it on your taxes. This is my second Crumpler product. I have a tad smaller bag for my camera gear (SLR with tons of lenses), I've been using for six years now."
4,Almost Complete...,"I suppose it was just bad luck that the first API (ReadDirectoryChanges) I needed help with wasn't in this book. I ended up spending some time searching the news groups to get more information. Seems like ReadDirectoryChanges should have been included in a book that has been described as the ""definitive reference for the Win32 API""... A bit disappointing."
1,More of the same,"No, you're not crazy. 3 songs on this CD are exact duplicates of previously released material on ""Gypsy Songman"" album. My Old Man, David & Me, and Railroad Lady have a much younger Jerry Jeff voice and the musical accompaniments are also the same. They are excellent versions though. But hey, I already paid for that CD so what's up with this? This is just more recycled stuff from a once great singer/songwriter who is milking all of us die hard fans every few years with another CD."
1,RIP OFF,"This CD should never have been released. The only thing of interest on it is Django's song ""The Road You Choose"" the rest is mostly recycled songs from earlier CD's that are much worse than previously released versions. Whats the matter Ronald??? you dont have enough money already that you have to rip off your loyal fans with this junk?"
5,Water,"For Steve Hillage Gong fans, this is the one you want because this is Hillage's ""Electric Ladyland"", so if you aren't willing to shell out the wasted money for all the other System 7 CDs like I did (a lot anyway)looking for some of his magical moments, look no further. This is the best thing he's ever done, and my complements to Miquette.Rythmic, ambient progressive space music; looping, cross fades, fade ins and outs; evolving, atmospheric, ethnic Asian Indian in some areas, glissando reverbed background drone type guitar and what can I say. Motu's Ethno Instrument software should help me replicate a similar vibe in my own music. This hits me square in the face: ""This is what we're capable of, but we dish out the dance music to make a living"". A very unfortunate fact I regret. This is the best ever, Steve...do it again! Released '94; I bought in '06.Steve Jernigan4/2/07"
4,Better Than the Movie,"All right, I admit. I watched ""Fritz the Cat"" when I was 14 - sort of as a rite of passasge. I didn't find the movie all that interesting (except the sex parts - hey, I was 14). I stumbled across the CD recently and picked it up, looking for some instrumental music. I was very much surprised. The music is rather simple but excellent - acid-jazz and funk elements in a nice mix. The oldies thrown in are a nice treat. The actual title song to ""Fritz the Cat"" is lousy, but it's short and easy to skip. Recommended to any jazz/funk/acid-jazz fans."
5,Classic but available for much less elsewhere,"Classic GMing advice from one of the best in the field. But after the publisher went bankrupt the price of this version soared. Not clear to me why. Much of the same material is available in a later book by the same author: GURPS Horror 4th edition. Maybe more system specific, but still similar content.GURPS Horror 4th Edition (GURPS: Generic Universal Role Playing System)GURPS HorrorI'd take a close look at the more recent book before sending money on this one."
4,I love this case!,This is a great case for my PDA and all my documents.I have used it as my wallet for a few years now. I love it!Too bad the zipper is coming undone from overuse... I might just have to get a new one. I haven't been able to find something as useful in the market.
2,bent,i ordered 3 vents and ALL was in plastic protected but when I opened them all one was bent on both ends and had to use a pair of channel lock pliers to bend it back to be able to use it as it would have cost more to send it back for a replacement...not pleased with this transaction at all!
4,"JUST A SAMPLE OF SOME OF HIS GREATEST HITS, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM","There are at least 4 (Four) or 5 (Five) 'Hits' and/or 'Collections' by Johnnie Taylor on Compact Disc, but if you are on a tight budget this will work. Includes the Gold #1 Billboard Hit Singles: ""Who's Making Love"", and ""I Believe In You"". The #1 Billboard Smash ""Jody's Got Your Girl"". There is 1 (One) odd cut that was NOT a Billboard Charted Hit ""Just Keep On Loving Me"" that could have been replaced by at least 10 (Ten) other of Johnnie's Billboard Hit Charting Stax Singles. Maybesomebody sleep at the wheel when this was being put together?. If you have a decent budget go out and buy the Box Set entitled: ""Lifetime"", this covers almost all of his chart hits, album favorites, and a few Rare Gems to boot!"
1,Wrong Car,"They sent me a box of wires that go on a Dodge, my car is a Ford, and it does not use wires, it has a coil for each plug and uses non traditional wires...I am in the process of returning them..."
3,Chalet bird feeder,"Perky Pet 50144 Deluxe Chalet Cedar Feeder, 5 lb capacityThis is an OK bird feeder, but the squirrels have easy access to it, nothing prevents them from jumping on the ledge and gobbling up all the seed before the birds can get it. The suet feeders at the side went quickly, and I don't fill them anymore. The top slides off to the side sometimes, as it is not anchored. The rope to hang the feeder isn't real handy either. It's not my favorite design, but it works OK."
1,Not worth it...,"Arrived broken. Initially thought it was probably due to poor packaging but upon inspection of the bird feeder, it's just very cheaply made. Have nailed it together but would definitely not purchase again."
3,"Nice birdhouse, bad packaging","This is a very nice quality birdhouse with a clever design. Unfortuantely it arrived broken. The box was much larger than the birdhouse and the only padding used was crumpled up brown paper. It appears the birdhouse moved around in transit because a large piece of wood chipped off the roof. I don't have time to return it, and I don't particularly want to deal with the hassle either, so I'm going to get soem wood glue and try to repair it myself. I'm giving this 3 stars, but more accurately I'd give the product 5 stars and the packaging 1 star."
2,Dissapointed,When received this item had several deep scratches on the one side of the plexiglass and cracks in the wood.
3,Wish the rope was longer,"I like the bird feeder; however the rope is not long enough to hang anywhere, so I had to put it on the ground... not as much fun, since you cannot really see the birds."
2,Seed Spiller,"The quality of the wood and construction are great, but the slot in the bottom where the seed comes out can get out of control, before I knew it I have dozens of birds hitting it and kicking alot of seed out that was not eaten. not that great."
5,Good,Birds love this as they are always at this feeder. Space for lots of birds to get food. Have made my own suet and birds come.
4,Attractive Bird Feeder,"This is a an attractive bird feeder and has a strong scent of cedar. While I haven't used it yet, it seems that when a bird lands on the perch, its going to be right up against the window and have difficulty feeding, despite what is shown in the photo. I'm handy so I drilled holes and inserted a few round wooden pegs into the shelf on each side so when the birds feed, they have easier access to the seed. Other than that, I'm pleased with the feeder."
1,Not for glass top surface units,"This griddle does not have a flat bottom, but a recessed bottom; therefore, it can not be used on a glass top surface unit. Liked the glass bacon press which I thought was better than cast iron for the nonstick surface. I am purchasing a Circulon 2 18-by-10-Inch Double Burner Griddle which I believe is flat bottomed.Circulon Elite Double-Burner Nonstick Hard-Anodized Griddle with Glass Bacon Press"
1,more rockhouse method crap,"This book was awful. I compare it to the grimoire to try to make sense of it and its more confusing. Maybe its me that's dumb but I've been playing for over a decade and know quite a bit about chord theory and scales- so this should just fall in line right? Nope. Oh, I have a B.A. degree and an A.A.S degree so I know how to read. Its endless memorization of note patterns without any good explanation of why. And in the dvd everything sounds the same. Okay maybe its me but after 'modes demystified' this guy remains mystified."
1,Modes Demystified review,"I found this way to complicated and hard to understand. In addition, there's dozens of scales to memorize and is (in my opinion) very tedious work. After going through the entire CD several times, I still had no idea what modes were. Until I found Desi Serna, his CD made it so easy to understand and use it makes me feel silly it took me so long to get it. Check out Desi Serna, he is very easy to understand on all his CD's. Finally, I get it!"
3,Good man; Flawed Book,"Let me first say that Aneas Williams is an excellent example to follow, a real man who shows us what respect really means. I do not for a minute doubt his sincerity, and my rating is a rating of his book, not his character. Unfortunately, out of nine chapters, this book goes about 2-7. Two of the chapters are really good.. one about marriage, one about learning from a mentor. Beyond these, though, there is little about what we're really looking for.. --respect--. Aeneas talks about how he respected a coach here and there, but there's not much beyond these mentions. It's mostly just a timeline of events in his public life (i.e., football games). The ""private life,"" where respect really grows and shows, is rarely mentioned. It was a great concept for a book, but poorly executed."
4,Revenue Management and Pricing: Case Studies,I liked this book a lot. The cases give a variety of revenue and pricing optimization examples. The possible solutions section in the back of the book reviews solutions to the cases. The book will make you think about alternative uses of the technology.
3,Wonderful!,This book was a great book! I liked it a lot. R.L. Stine wrote it very good. He needs towrite more of them like that. By Jarel
4,"Good but slightly illogical -- & the cover's a ""tip-off""","I found this story's surprise ending to be well foreshadowed from the beginning -- perhaps a bit TOO well foreshadowed, in fact. This, in combination with the picture on the front cover (which gives away FAR too much if one is sufficiently alert and thoughtful), left me in no surprise as to the book's ending, which is a great shame for a story so otherwise well-written. Also there are peripheral embellishments to the story that make little sense. For all that, however, the story is well-written and quite creepy... and if you can manage to miss the relevant clues, a big surprise awaits you at the end of the tale!My rating of 8 is reduced from 10 due to the overshadowing problem and the minor illogicalities."
4,Great Introduction to the Area,"We're moving to Rockland County and I really appreciated the pages listing parks and points of interest. I also find the spiral book format much easier to manage than a traditional fold-out map. Why not 5 stars? Our new street, Cardean Place, is listed as Cardean Street. Not a huge deal but maps should be as accurate as possible."
1,Gatsby Lite.,"Woooosh! That sucking sound you hear might not be the economy. Clunk! And that sound is McInerny dropping the ball. Finishing this one, I felt set up and knocked down. Brightness Falls was so very very good and this was so very very not. While Bright Lights and Story of My Life had their share of intriguing sections mixed in with amateurishness (let's not even get into Ransom), even the not so great parts were excusable in my mind, able to be explained away by the whole ""he's still finding his true voice"" deal. With Brightness Falls, a beautiful multitextured flow was achieved. And then this. The strength of Jay Gatsby as a character, and he's an obvious influence here, is that there is a charm to him despite his arrogant jerkiness, etc. I dare you to find a way to care about Will Savage. A real disappointmen"
2,Last of the Savages: A Waste of Time and Money,"The dialogue is forced, the story contrived. By the end of the book, the characters emerge caricatures. Plain and simple, this ""work"" is a waste of time and money."
3,Not What you would expect from Jay McInerney,"This book does not have the feel of all of the other novels by Jay McInerney. This work deviates from all of his other efforts. It is not as comical as past works. Not too pretensious.What I like the most about this novel though, is the contrevorsy it stirs over, the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination as well as other historical events which took place during the 30 year span of this novel. It seems there is a little hint at hidden ""facts"" in this work of ""fiction"".A must read for sociologists and contrevorsy theorists, and oh yeah the disciples of McInerney. Be forewarned disciples, this is not the usual Jay."
1,Abused Indulgences,"BLBC entitles JM to indulgence. Short, telling, sharp, it was.LOS is, unfortunately, a really, really bad book. I would not have finished it except for JI being who he is.The characters are really awful. He periodically hints (obtusely) to ""secrets"" that will be revealed later in the novel, ""secrets"" that are neither surprising nor interesting.I would have paid not to have read this book."
5,Best as a Primer or Review,"I listened to this before school started and replayed certain sections for review during school. Miller makes the material interesting and not as dry as what I thought it would be. He does not go into great detail, but offers a good overview of Civ Pro with examples you can follow. I found it very helpful to listen to during my drive to and from school, but I would not just want to sit down and listen. It will not be your only supplement, but if you have a 1/2 hour+ drive it will help you understand the concepts. It's a little pricey at $70+ but so is law school."
4,Very good intro that can be listend to while commuting.,"Professor Miller does an excellent job introducing all the topics covered in a first year civil procedure class. He is a good speaker and I found him somewhat entertaining at times. He is able to break down a topic into its essentials and allows you to understand what the whole point is about. I agree with the other reviewers that he does not go into a great detail into each subject - but how can one really cover a full course in depth on 10 cds?. However, these CD's will allow you a great springboard into fully understanding what your standard text is saying. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the tapes are a bit outdated with only a 1999 update available (at least on the ones I bought for my 2006-2007course )."
4,Not too bad,"Very pleased with the flip case, however think it is a bit pricey. Provides the kind of protection I need working in a manufacturing facility. Love the belt clip, and it seems sturdy enough to hold up. 5 stars if it was under 25 bucks."
2,Not too happy!,"I am not too happy with this case. The belt clip does not fit any work belt I wear. It will work fine with a dress belt, but not any kind of wide work belt. The inside of the case is full of dried glue where they glued the lining to the leather. Most of all, the ipaq will not fit in the charging cradle while it is in the case; you have to take it out of the case everytime you want to sync it to your computer or charge it. Also I don't like the pocket on the inside of the case. Anything you put in the pocket (like an sd card) presses directly on the screen. It may be safe, but I'm not going to take a chance with the screen. Searh for something better, especially at the price of this one."
1,bad screen,"The screen is really bad quality, the picture doesn't seem to be really flat. The remote is horribly designed."
5,Great Fun,This was as expected and will great fun for the child it was purchased for. Good christmas gift overall. Thanks
5,Great DVD!,My 16 month old grandson adores Blue's Clues and this episode was perfect for holiday viewing. Love all the Blue's Clues episodes!
4,Inspiring! Great script and Detail,"There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come... as the saying goes. Very enjoyable! From the cadet point of view especially. The acting was well down. the Special effects were far-reaching during the second half, where it becomes more intense. the texture and cinematography were exquisite. Sound track was moving throughout movie. Overall I believe it definitely gives the Halo Mythos more depth and realism. It also fills in some gaps in the Halo time-line. This movie actually made me cry in some scenes. The acting depiction of master chief was surprisingly good and the ending left me more curious than before about who the spartans were. Such mystery behind the helmet!"
3,Descent,"This series was ok. It seemed to get of to a really slow start, but picked up towards the end. The characters, action, story seem very promising. I am looking forward to the next series."
4,2 thumbs up,Wasn't expecting much but actually ended up enjoying the movie very much! Wish I got to see what happens next!
4,"Is Vancouver, BC the new Hollywood for top Sci-Fi TV?","If you like BattleStar Galactica and Stargate SG-1, this will feel familiar. It starts off a little slow, but then great stories sometimes do. At least they begin at the beginning, before the main cast even is aware of the Covenant and humans are still at war with other humans. The effects are as good as can be, but the Covenant are hard to see in detail, probably due to the night fight scene. I got a rush just from seeing an operational, live-action Warthog."
5,Great Movie for Fans or New comers,"I thought this movie was amazing! It had a lot of action, plenty of story line, and kept true to the Halo franchise. The actors were perfectly played, and the only thing I could say about this movie is that I hope there is another one soon."
3,should have been better,"Acting cast was not great, perhaps because of a low budget or poor directing. Given the great plot possible because of the Halo game, should have been much better."
5,Amazing Halo movie for a newcomer,"I am trading in Lady Lara Croft in for Master Cheif, don't get me wrong I still love Tomb Raider but I have been a fan of it since I played the second game. Anyway I saw this on youtube as the webseries and I fell in love with it. I love everything about it. The story telling was amazing, and this is an example of what i can do with my own webseries. I was excited to see the actress that plays susan from the narnia films, the first two anyway in this. It's a great way for new comers that are interested in Halo to check out. I hope they come out with more Halo movie and more webseries, this is awesome. People need to use this as a place to start when making future Halo movies. I got this for christmas by the way."
3,It was alright.,"Nothing special, ok to rent but not worth buying. The story was a bit confusing and once it got going it left you hanging."
2,Don't waste your money.,"Stupid movie. I understand that it was low budget, but come on. It's plot is so blah. If you're a halo fanboy you may get a thrill but for the other 99% of human beings, you will not like this piece of crap. Dont charge so much for what's basically a YouTube video and maybe my rating would be better. Do not waste your life on this."
2,Wasn't that good,"I wish I had just rented this, I wasn't very impressed with it at all. The production hours were decent, but the story dragged on for about 10 minutes of action."
3,Nothing New,"I REALLY enjoyed watching this movie online, and was excited for the DvD because of the extra footage. With the exception of a brief introduction to the cadets at the start of the movie, there was nothing on the DVD that was not on the web episodes. Granted, it was only $12, and it is nice to watch the film without the break between switching web episodes, but I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you plan to watch the movie many times."
2,Bored,The pace of the movie was way too slow and the storyline was not the least bit exciting or thought-provoking. I lost interest after 10 minutes.
2,So disappointed in this movie,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie of Halo because I have never seen one before and I love all the games. This movie sucked so bad and its a shame that whoever made this movie screwed it up so bad. I hate when people does this. Go play the game first and learn about it and then go make the movies.1. The movie focused on the cadets way to much in their training. Who cares about the cadets! Especially about the boy and his brother somewhere fighting the war.2. Takes forever for Master Chief to show up and when he does he babysits a bunch of kids.3. You barley see any fighting actions from Master Chief.4. Master Chief was on maybe 15 minutes and then the movie ended.As far as how things looked that part was awesome. The suits, weapons, warthog, & Covenant was that of the game.Cortana looked great too but I did expect to see her a lot with Master Chief but you don't."
1,boring and badly acted.,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible acting and the screenplay is lacking in both content and imagination.
1,Boring,Good for teens who want to see teenage romance and adventures but totally lacking anything else. I would not waste money on it.
1,not impressed at all,i am a big fan of the halo games and even though this is movie number 4 it was still the first one iv seen and i was not impressed at all.for a movie that was based off a action game like halo there was very little action and the movie seemed to move along at a snails pace.i would not recommend buying this movie on disc or here on amazon nor would i recommend renting it in any kind of way either
1,Huh?,"You have to be a player to understand this at all. But for someone who was interested in the concept and whether or not I might play, all I can say is...HUH? Starts and ends somewhere, with something going on, but neither of us could figure any of that out, or what it had to do with anything we just saw, etc. Left me clueless. Not interested in the movie or the game."
1,Boring,"Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring ... don't waste your money. Boring. Did I mention, boring? Boring, boring, boring, boring."
4,Good but not great,"Okay so I'm a dude and could do with out the mushy stuff.I wanted more aliens, but that being said it is still a decent movie for the budget they had.I could see watching more of these types of movies."
4,Suprisingly well done,I was shocked that this was as good as it was. I was not expecting much. Nice effects and the acting is good.
4,good stuff,"Love Halo game and Forward Unto Dawn is good stuff , not cheesy. The action and acting is good , it felt very new and refreshing show."
1,No subtitles :(,There's no subtitles- no very hearing impaired friendly. Couldn't find a way to access closed captioning either. Was hoping a refund or a remake of it with subtitles?:(:(
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS BIG TIME,"I've seen more action in a Muppet Movie. You watch a group of recruits ""getting to know each other"" through most of the movie. The action doesn't start until the last half hour of the show when the aliens arrive, then it looks like a panty raid in the dark with fire crackers going off.. The aliens are hardly visible for more than a few seconds. Its more like a reality show/soap opera. This movie was a total waste of time and money."
1,Seen all of it online,"Which made me mad. I thought the online videos were a teaser for more stuff on this bluray, but there was NO new material. What a waste."
2,"Bad story, bad actors , bad movie","I gave it 2 starts for the nice effects and animation, other than that its just crap.Not worth the money."
2,Action doesn't start until 40 minutes in,"After reading previous POSITIVEly glowing reviews, I gave this a chance. Didn't realize the real action only started about 40-50 minutes in. Don't get me wrong, I realize how a thin plot and characters can ruin a movie (e.g., Transformers, Clash of the Titans) but the time spent on character development seemed, well, overwrought. The CGI is good, when it occurs, but it doesn't save the movie. I wouldn't recommend getting this movie at the current price ($4)."
2,big mistake,"I wish all my mistakes in life cost the same price that I paid to rent this movie from amazon. The story is weak, the acting is outright bad, and the special effects pedestrian. I watched two movies tonight, Prometheus was excellent and Halo 4 is just a glorified paint ball game on the back side of Burnaby mountain, truely a waste of two hours. I gave it two stars because it was filmed at SFU, a place where I spent more time in the SUB pub than in class."
1,Junk,piece of crap. I want a refund!! It is all bad nothing to recommend. It is pure merde.. Film is dead in America.
5,Epic,Loved it. I would really like to see them do some more of these. Definitely the best scifi movie I've seen in a long time. Beautifully filmed too.
4,"Pretty good, but...","I loved the movie! effects... story... etc... But I thought it was also pointless. It felt to me like what happened in this movie has no significance over the overall story of the Master Chief or the war against the covenant. Not to mention at the end, Lasky looks so grown up, mature, and beefy, but he's tiny and scrawny again at the start of Halo 4...! As a stand alone movie though, I highly recommend! Just pretend you didn't watch it when you play the game! =)"
1,Did not work in my region,Did not play in my region so I cannot judge either way. A better warning for regions would have been appreciated.
2,Did I Miss Something?,"Not quite a ""zero"", but pretty close. I had read many reviews and media press about the Halo 4 movie and the trailer was awesome. But this short film by Microsoft was lacking. Perhaps if they release another episode they will do better as far as content goes. The graphics were cool, but again lacking and there is so much potential with making this great. I was just disappointed."
4,Attention to all potential buyers!,"Here's a word of advice; If you want a fast paced story about marines making a stand alongside the masterchief don't get this movie. This movie was meant more to provide some backstory to a character in Halo 4. If you already enjoy the Halo games and want a bit of backstory, get this. It's that simple."
4,Interesting prelude.,"The story is good, yet a bit rushed. There's a few glitches in regards to HALO canon, such as the MJOLNIR the Chief is wearing (which I think should be the Mark II variant as opposed to the Mark III-ish depicted on screen), but an interesting story nonetheless."
4,Halo Movie,Bought this movie for my son who is a huge fan of the HALO video games and toys. He liked it!
5,Epic,"I don't normally review things on here but this movie\miniseries was fantastic and a great addition to the Halo portfolio. It was a job well done, top marks."
2,"Good sience fiction idea, very poor action",As sience fiction movie the idea was very good. However the movie was too slow for more than 60% of it. Some action at the end which being at night you loose all details
4,Great! but!!!,"The only bad art about this movie is Chiefs voice!!! its not the same voice actor!!! :C Other than that, well done!"
1,Fan movies are better,"The movie is one and a half hour long. You have 55 minutes of a cheap and slow paced teenager drama that is worse than a fan made movie. Then, suddenly the movie starts and it becomes the usual alien-chasing-humans action sequence until it ends. The credits come, and after that you have the bloopers that kills all the mood.When you meet real young war vets who have scars from war, you understand that the screenplay was made by someone who does not know any war vet.The music is awesome and it has very good landscapes from time to time. So you may like to buy the soundtrack instead of the movie.If you are a fan of good scifi movies, I do not recommend this movie at all. It is boredom in 2/3 of the movie and some 1/3 of movie with some forgettable action sequences. ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is far better as it has a similar teenager style, but it was better made in terms of drama, action and pace."
1,TERRIBLE FILM,This is one of the worse movies do not rent not buy. I couldn't finish the movie it was horrible stay away take my advice. The service from amazon is outstanding but this film.... Stay away
4,Don't Buy This!!,"Do NOT buy this. I have no idea, nor do I understand why anybody would buy this. It is on Youtube and Halo Waypoint for FREE! Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining, which is why I gave it a 4 star review. It was even better because I watched it all for FREE!For the actual review: Forward Unto Dawn was very entertaining. There was interesting main-character development, while other side characters were pushed aside; that's not a bad thing. Forward Unto Dawn is a good prequel for Halo 4 with Lasky and his interactions with Master Chief. Forward Unto Dawn focuses on Lasky and his training to become a UNSC trooper, but there are complications!! (Love story and personal ambition). I don't want to give away too much. Trust me, you're going love watching it! The production values are pretty good, considering there was a hefty 10,000,000 dollar budget set aside just for this movie, which is pretty impressive. Watch it! Just don't forget that you don't need to buy it!"
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!,"My husband and I love the Halo games. He watched the entire Forward Unto Dawn series when 343 put it up on the web as free videos for their fans. Once they realized it was successful, they decided to release it on BluRay. I have no problem with this, but then they PULLED ALL BUT THE FIRST TWO EPISODES offline!! This series was promised to Halo fans everywhere as a FREE webseries. It is very disappointing that 343 would renege on their promise like this. They are a terrible company, and do NOT deserve your financial support. If we hadn't already bought Halo 4, we would return it. There are enough honest companies out there, why give your business to one that is just out to take advantage of the fans it should be catering to?"
1,Why waste the money?,"I absolutely LOVE the Halo series but who would in their right mind buy this? The whole series is available online, for FREE. I'm sure everyone is knowledgeable enough to know how to rip it off of Youtube. For someone who has also read the books, the story doesn't reveal anything that I didn't already know about, and the acting is sub-par. Slightly better quality and added commentary don't make it worth the money. With $16 dollars you can buy a couple of the books, which goes without say, are way more interesting. Halo: Legends is also a better bang for your buck."
4,Not perfect but a great live-action rendition of the Halo franchise!,Good prelude/backstory to Halo 4 and one of it's NPCs. Definitely worth a viewing. The only knock I really had for this was the fact Steve Downes was not the voice of Master Chief.
3,Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn,I give it 3 stars because it was really slow throughout the entire movie until Master Chief appeared than the graphics and the storyline really picked up.
2,Lame,"Very, very boring for an action movie. Seemed like a stupid attempt to rip off full metal jacket in SciFi."
3,Duh I'm way to old to get this history or game,Saying that although I needed a lot more in the end....because I was interested....I actually enjoyed what was there...but as it was game into movie.....as real movie if you aren't of that generation I needed more but not a waste...I enjoyed and maybe learned about those years younger than me....just don't ask me to play the games....I've tried and frustration made me feel violent and that was a fishing game!!!
2,Review,"I have seen the other HALO movie, I thought this was slow, acting was terrible. I also realize that there's no comparison to the full-length animated movie"
3,Not quite the kick-@ game,"The movie is somewhat slow paced and raises more questions than it answers about the characters, the academy and what the heck are they doing there in the first place! Way too much time spent on teenage angst, too many scenes with the same message and just when you're getting to know the people, most of them get blown away. (Oops! but I didn't say who!) The action is decent and some creative effects. Too little deus ex Master Chief, of course, but still worth the watch. Hope the next one is better."
1,Beware region codes,"Amazon should put up a better warning system for people ordering from outside of the US.The block books by informing that ""this book isn't available for your region ..."" but not apparently for DVD's and Blu Rays.Title gets 1 star (I'm being generous) because I can't bloody well view it.Disgusted with Amazon."
5,Forward Unto Dawn :),"As a miniseries on Youtube, the drama was a bit drawn out at first. But the story was told very well. Another reviewer made a comment about this being a Starship Trooper knock off... apparently that reviewer only saw a few minutes of Starship Troopers, because the socioeconomic themes developed through Starship Troopers (while I do like them) are completely absent in Halo. Instead, Forward unto Dawn does an excellent job developing the premise of internal conflict and struggle of a Cadet under presure about who he is and how he makes that personal distinction, and what he does when he is called to action by one of the most powerful figures in Halo history. His struggle, his loss, his sacrifice and his choice. Wonderfully done and lovely to experience."
5,Great!,It was an awesome movie!!! Any halo fan would absolutely love this movie. Very entertaining and a lot of action along with a great story that's not told in the game. It's just great :)
3,Halo 4,I watched tho because I have the games. It helped with the story line and told a good deal about the promethians.
5,Very Good,"I enjoyed them movie. I'd watch the sequel. As others have pointed out, I wish there was more to the story."
4,One step closer to a major motion picture...,"If there were no elements of Halo in this movie the story-line and character base could not keep it above the threshold of being entertaining. The graphics are on par with, let's say, a STARZ mini-series. I know most people will say that the substance of a movie is not derived from the graphics, but to those people I say that there isn't much of a story to compensate for mediocre graphics, and in a Halo movie graphics ARE important. You're not going to put a guy in a Covenant costume...you hire Andy Serkis and pump 70 million dollars into those CG scenes, HALO deserves it!Now, with that out of the way I will tell you why this movie deserves a 4-star rating:1. It IS Halo, afterall.2. It feels like a ""fan=boy"" production...and I can relate to any fan-boy of Halo.3. It is the best Halo film available."
3,It was ok,I am looking forward to any sequels to this movie. I am not a big Halo fan but this is a pretty good movie.
4,Finally! A Halo movie worth watching,"Like many others, I've been waiting for years for a good Halo movie. I know, I know... this really isn't a ""movie"", but once they assembled all the parts, it is excellant, and you could have fooled me! This sets a very high bar for the ""professional"" movie makers, when (or 'if') they get around to making movie."
4,Entertaining,"My children loved it for the action and of course it's Halo. The graphics were good, the plot was good, overall it was pretty good."
4,Halo 4,Good movie. Had some very good action scenes. Movie has a very good story line behind it which allows you to get into the halo series.
5,great movie,Slow in the start but then pick up and is worth every min.leave off for second movie and lot of stuff from the video game.
2,HALO FLOP,I loved the last Halo movie and I thought this one was really going to be good it was not. It was not animation like the video game it was live action and the plot was not good too much time on the school and not enough of a real story and the actors was not good.
5,Mysterious & Fun,"I can see how Ray Manzorack (spl?) of the ""Doors"" was infuenced by this Organist. He exudes the same mystery from the organ keyboards. This CD is the combination of two of Korla Pandits ealier vinyl albums. It isn't just another organists music, it's meditative at times and mysterious at others. Some of the tracks are reminiscent of theater organs during the silent film era. Super."
5,One of the best books i have ever read,"This was one of the best books i have read in years, i found it included all the aspects i found to make up an excellent story, Plot, Scenes, Descriptions, Just everything about it.The only problem i could find was that I you are unable to get hold any of the other books in the series anymore."
5,Eternal - mercenary and series!,"The first book in the Cosca series was great - in part because of the underlying premise, in part because of the writing ability. The second, third, and fourth in the series followed as well. But by the fifth I had been through all the world conflicts I cared for... and they just continued.By all means, get your hands on the first three or four. They are well worth the money. After that... enjoy the wars."
5,casca series,i read what i beleived to be the entire casca series when i was in the marine corps.i passed it along to my freinds as i thought it was just another story.i used to buy the books at the p.x. on base.this was around 1987-88ish.i got out of the corps in '92.since then i have looked hi and low for the series.i just found it today on the net in 3/01.if there is anyway i can i will have the series again.im sooo happy to have found it again!!
5,Whoa!? How much is that used paperback?,"The Eternal Mercenary, Casca Series, Book 1Try the Books in Motion version for a cheaper alternative! Try Audibledotcom for an even cheper download. You won't be sorry. It is UNabridged and Gene Engene is incredible. He has the deep, richly masculine voice you would expect of Casca, and he performs the voices of other characters, women and old men very well without sounding phony. His pace and cadence sets the stage for the story as he controls the tension."
1,not in stock after all!,"I don't like it when people waste my time. Four days after I ordered from this seller, I was told that a refund was being processed because this item was out of stock. This was supposed to be a gift, and it was delayed because I had to reorder from another company."
2,NOT PLEASED,"I ordered 3-of this same product. The comapny shipping the items shipped the items in the advertised time period. However, I found the items were not made of a material that were strong enough to adequately prevent one real kick in type of burglary. I know no item is totally burglary proof but I expected this item to be made of an adequate material to make it quite difficult to kick in the door. All 3-items were returned."
4,great versitile security!,Would like to see a discount for ordering multiples so I could get more! Also great for travel in hotels.
3,Weak,"this door guard is weak. it is not as sturdy as one i had previously bought from bed bath and beyond years ago.i was disappointed in the 2 i bought, but will use them hoping they serve their purpose."
5,Happy customer !,"Product was as described , packaged well and in good condition. A good value as well. Very easy to install. Thanks."
5,just what I wanted!,"This lamp is beautiful, such a good buy. There's nothing out there like it. A great buy and highly recommended."
4,Who Killed Canadian History?,"I read this book and thought why is this not required reading for every Canadian High School student. It explains why we seem to have no sense of who we are and try to please every group in our society , in detriment to our identity as a nation. Looking at history in politically correct terms does not give anyone a sense of who we are and where we are going. It proves you can not change history using todays politically acceptable language and have any substance in the text. Loved this thought provoking book! Wake up CANADA before we lose our total identity!"
3,Fairly exciting mysteries!,"I picked this up in the airport for light reading and was very amused by these 4 short story/mystery/romances. Karen Robards tale about a Country Western singer and the DEA agent who saves both their lives in a rather chilling, exciting chase was very good.Andrea Kane's story about an inheritance that really messes up a family plan was interesting.Linda Anderson's tale about a small town librarian and the handsome professor boarding at her mother's Bed and Breakfast was scary and chilling. I was kept guessing for a period of time on who the bad guy was. Mariah Stewart's story I found was the weakest. It just did not do it for me. But I finished the whole book by the time I got to Atlanta and it was a fun read."
4,Very Nice,This chest is very nice. I bought it because I saw the segment on Oprah where the woman presented her children with a chest/box full of keepsakes from their childhoods. This is what I have in mind with the chest but not sure it's the right size. It is very nice though.
4,good book--what there is of it,"If a boy sees his father as a castrating figure, is that boy really more likely to depict his father mowing the lawn? If a child is jealous of an academically successful sibling, is that child really more likely to depict that sibling on an A-frame swing set? In this book, we see many examples of these theories and others. Interesting examples indeed, but I would like to see statistics also.Although the book is almost 300 pages, most of it is full-page illustrations and white space. I learned only a little bit, but that was because it took only a few hours to read the book.I would advise obtaining a copy through your local library or through interlibrary loan, but not spending too much money on buying a copy...."
2,Moel HB35R,"I have had this timer a number of years now - works OK, but the plastic on/off trippers are difficult to move. I took one out to change the OFF time - it slipped out of my hand and fell thru a space between boards on my my porch. Can't find relacement tripper! Some advertised are metallic - mine was red plastic. Do I have to buy a new timer for one small part?"
4,Works Great,"I needed a timer to go in my electric box outside. Since it's in the box, it doesn't get rained on, but it get's COLD. I've had this 2 weeks and so far it's perfect. Easy to set up, and has not been affected by the temperatures."
5,Frisky Phonics Fun 2,"As a teacher, I am always looking for good resources to use in my classroom. One of my colleagues had this and I liked it so much, even though it is out of print, I sought it out. I am glad I did! Thanks!"
3,very blurry at 800 x 600,"Although the 1024 x 768 res at 75 Hz produces a relatively crisp picture with incredible color, the lower 800 x 600 res is very blurry. I plan to compare other lcd monitors in the next few days and will quite likely return this monitor. Otherwise, the monitor has great controls, looks very sweet, is very stable with its well-designed pedestal base, is a fine gray/silver color, and uses at most the power a 30-watt light bulb pulls."
4,Helpful!,Very helpful and a good read for anyone looking into have weight loss surgery or have family or Friends that want or have had the surgery!!
2,Where is the Point?,"This book wonders around a lot and really makes you wonder if it has a point or perspective on the subject. The author has had weight loss surgery, but seems to feel that anyone else exploring the idea should diet instead. There are some valuable tidbits in the book, but the structure and writing leaves me a little confused. The chapter headings don't even seem to relate to the content.A good thesis statement and skillful editor might have made this an average book."
2,Scary for pre-op patients,I have read numerous books on the weight loss surgery beforehand and I have to say this is the worst one. It is scary to read preop. It focuses on the death rate (which if you are considering this surgery you already know it) but the author goes into detail about it.It makes you feel like a failure that you need this surgery. It repeatedly lists that after time you will basically gain back 50% of the weight back.It devotes a whole chapter to negative aspects of the surgery but not much info on the positive aspects of it.The only good thing about this book is the weight loss surgery quiz.
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the characters in this story - but finished the book feeling frustrated. I felt the ending to be harsh and not very realistic. There was tremendous build up, only to have the author quickly move past the meaningful parts to the story. There was no closure for me and was frustrated that justice was not part of the story."
4,Good book,"A real page-turner of a story about the first woman president--whose ambition and corruption bring her down. I liked the Christian perspective of the author that, despite the protagonist's flaws, offered her a chance for forgiveness and redemption."
2,did not love,"i read The Note by Angela Hunt and loved it. I did not love this one. I would not recomend it. It was extreamly slow in the beginning and as an earlier review said "" There was no justice ""."
2,"Civilization in the West, by Kishlansky, Geary, O'Brien","This book is a cornucopia of detail. It is undeniably the most detailed of any textbook on the subject. Unfortunately, this otherwise useful textbook suffers from poor if not outright negligent editing. Some paragraphs are virtually incomprensible. The text reads as if the individual authors took turns writing sentences. The concept of topic sentences and paragraphs expressing discrete subjects seems to have been lost on the authors as well as the editors."
4,"Civ in the West 2, as a history text","It's a pretty good read. Didn't have to force myself through it. They make it human and accessible. It's a good well-rounded overview (AFAIK. I wasn't there, of course ; )), with some moments of ""zooming in"" on particular people, writings, or movements.I will say there are a few pieces of information that varied slightly from what our teacher said, or from what I've heard hasn't been found to be historically accurate (e.g., ""The Rule of Thumb's"" infamous supposed source -- see snopes.com)."
2,This text book is very dull.,"This book is used as a MEH textbook for sophomores in my highschool. My friends and i found this book to be very dull and boring. It contains a lot of information but the way it is presented is not in an interesting manner, rather in a dull way. This book has no bold words which makes it difficult for us to read. I believe it was chapter 17 or 18 that the beginning was very interesting but suddenly it became boring. I think history is interesting but the way that this book teaches it to you is very uninteresting. I don't suggest this book for any highschool student. Everyday when we get our history assignment i dread to read this book because it is so boring."
4,Two of the three were heartwarming Christmas Stories,"I personally enjoyed the first story the most. I felt the characters were more developed, and I the focus of the story was more on Christmas and togetherness than any of the other stories. I tried the recipe for the baker's clay ornaments and it was a lot of fun for me and my children. The second story was not very good at all. There were many typos and the story only mentioned Christmas here and there. It seemed kind of slapped together and I was kind of like ""yeah right"" when I finished reading it. The third story was good, the characters were believable and likeable. Christmas was definately an important part of the story too. Overall I enjoyed reading this book and it was a great book to read around Christmas time!"
5,The best oil ever made,"The brand Mobil is the best ever made, I like their Syntethic Oil, the should make oil filters for that kind of oil."
4,Nice dolls,"I bought this for my daughter in T****t for $19.99 (regular price). I can't believe people out there charging double the list price on items. Anyway, my daughter loves these dolls. She is almost 4, and likes to pretend that they ""go out on dates"", and ""get married"". It's so cute to watch her play, the conversations are so grown-up and hilarious. She really enjoys them. I have to say that Prince Eric doesn't get invited to the Princess tea parties though."
4,Relaxing Time Gone By,"I was taking my son to school and really enjoying this song on KJAZZ out of Long Beach, CA and waited for the artist & title to be revealed. The music was just so relaxing and timeless that I ordered it as soon as I got home. The cd arrived a few days later and I play it whenever I just want to take my thoughts to a chilled out space."
4,good album,This album was well put together for the most part. This album contains a good mix of guitar harmonies as well as some chaotic vocal harmonies in a few songs.
4,"Disappointed, 4 or 4.5","The songs Tear Staind Lies, Hero's Trial, and a perfect smile and broken wings were much better on the demos I thought. Sounds to me like they slowed it down and took most of the feeling out of them. Still good songs, just not as good as before. Overall a great record too, so buy it. And what were they thinking not putting ballad for a liar on here? I enjoy the demo versions more. Still, the album is great. So is silver screen lovers."
4,Maybe even better than part one....,"...it begins with some one shots, some of them incredibly realistic and humane, and continues into Lord Fanny origin, which is Castaneda meets Morrison. The trade is coherent and not so psychodelic like rest of series is.If you like this, get Say You Want A Revolution"
3,A Poorly Written Book with Great Illustrations,"I had high hopes for this book. The author repeats in theme and variation the same story, each time less convincingly. I hazard to guess that this passes for critical thinking in the UK, I felt swindled."
3,"refurbished doesn't mean ""as new""","I really like this skillet and kept it for cooking...it performs well and has a large volume for cooking bigger quantities. But I bought it from the warehouse deals, and didn't realize that ""refurbished"" meant it would have visible damage to it (the lid on mine is dented). So, buyer beware... a refurbished item might have damage that is not decribed and not what you expect."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon!,"This might be a great pan, but DON'T BUY IT FROM AMAZON! They shipped it by freight in nothing but a plastic bag. Of course it arrived with a dented lid. It is surprising the glass wasn't broken. Then in order to return it, they credit us with an estimated $8 for shipping but it actually cost $25 to ship it back by the cheapest UPS method. RIP OFF!"
3,Good but not balanced well,"This is a good skillet, as long as you only cook with the lid on. If you take the lid off, the pan may fall towards the handle, because the handle is so heavy. I've lost food and burned myself twice this way (plus ruined a pair of jeans).I still use it, because it's a good pan, but if I had to buy another one I would choose a model with a lighter handle."
5,Excellent Skillet,"This deep skillet is wonderful for frying, because of its high sides there is no mess on the range top. The well made handle/grip is easy to use & doesn't get hot. A glass cover that fits as tightly as this one is great to find. I also like the very flat bottom of this pan, it makes me crazy when you get a skillet that is raised in the center. This skillet holds the heat great & cooks (no stick) like a dream."
4,"Great Pan, But","This pan is a great size for frying. I like it for its really big circumference and super high sides which discourages splattering.I bought this to match my new set of Circulon which I love because of the non-stick interior, higher sides, and well fitting clear lids.My only issue with this pan is it is not properly balanced. The handle tends to encourage tipping which isn't good when dealing with hot things such as oil. That's my only complaint. Otherwise this would be the perfect monster sized pan."
5,deep skillet review,"very nice skillet. deep, good non stick action. works so far with any skillet , stir fry , or sauce recipe. big enough for most any meal. i would highly recommend it"
2,Tossing it after just over two years.,"This was a great pan when it was new, but after using it maybe 1-2 times a week for just over two years (purchased February 2009), it's ready for the garbage. I never put it in the dishwasher or used metal utensils, so I think it just lost its non-stick naturally. Additionally, it tends to be a little tippy towards the handle. But I love the glass cover and the comfort handles on both. I just wish it would have lasted longer."
5,My everyday cooker,"I've tried pretty much all of the nonstick brands and eventually given them away. Not the Circulon. Its coating is tough and the skillet itself is of a size that makes it handy to use. It sautes, fries, grills, braises, etc. The lid makes it even more useful. If you are cooking main dishes for six or under people it becomes of all-purpose usefulness quickly. My ""good"" pots and pans now hang on their hooks neglected."
1,Worked fine for about 8 months..,"Food started sticking to the pan after about 8 months, turns out you can't use cooking spray either. It builds up and ruins the non stick. Maybe i'm ignorant, but this is the first time i'd ever heard of not being able to use cooking sprays on any pans whatsoever. Voids your warranty. Buyer beware of this overpriced piece of crap..."
2,Great for low temps only,"Higher temps cause the non-stick coating to disappear. The warranty is void if the pan is used for anything above medium heat. The bottom of my pan is no longer non-stick, but rather brown, almost rusty looking."
2,Ok but do not last more than 2.5 years!,"I bought that skillet 2.5 years ago for $38. It is now not very Notskicks! I feel it is a very short life for the price. As pictured by a user and posted along with this item, I have the same syndrome (light chipping on the edge and black deposit inside the bottom). It was good at first, but now we need to buy a new one since pretty much everything stick! I recommend you to try another product. I have just order Cuisinar skillet. I haven't tried it yet but it looks good."
4,"Great pan, but handle is uncomfortable and pan is too heavy","I love the pan size and how it cooks. I bought the pan as a present for my mother-in-law, but when I got it I realized it was too heavy for her. Also the handle shape is too flat and makes it difficult to hold when moving it especially when loaded with food. So I kept it for myself."
2,Not as Advertised,"While I received the items included as part of the package, the item itself was not as described. I was expecting the wooden collectible box, but all I got was saran wrapped cardboard. Also, a couple of the items were missing. This was bought as a birthday gift, and though my mom loved it for what it was, they could have at least tried harder to conform to what was advertised."
4,Nice Gift,"My parents have always been excessive coffee drinkers. (as am I - DNA?)Anyway, I sent this as one of my Mom's Mother's Day Gifts. She said it was wonderful - had a ton of great little items, cute packaging and delivered in good shape. Unfortunately she received it on Monday, the day after, but that's because I placed the order way too late. I was pleasantly surprised it was only one day late. (My fault - DNA?)"
4,Coffee basket,My mother loved this! She was gushing in excitement. Said it was the best gift! Only reason it got 4 stars is because if I didn't tell her it was from me she wouldn't have known. Her note which is clearly marked on my receipt didn't make it with her package.
3,Coffe Lovers gift basket,"I was told by the person that received the gift basket that it was very nice. But she was upset because it came without a card and she didn't know where it came from or who to thank. It was noted on my receipt, that I included a card and message."
1,Not so hot package,"I sorry to say the the majority of the package consisted of fancy boxes with not much in them, and some had stale products unworthy of a mother's day gift. The only decent things were some chocolate flavored candies and coffee. I'm very disappointed in this product, and do not recommend that you waste your money on it."
2,Not So Hot.,"Amazon did a great job on getting this basket to me on time.However, the product itself is unimpressive. The box is flimsy cardboard (not the attractive wood that the photo suggests). I can't comment on the flavors of the included items but I can say that quantities leave MUCH to be desired. The (4) coffee ""packages"" resemble single serve packets that are available in cheap motels. I think this would be a DECENT product at the $20-$25 price point.I am not sure I would want to give this to someone I care about.This is the second (and last) disappointment that I have experienced with this company."
3,"Enjoy the maps, beware of the commentary!","This a very attractive and informative atlas, the maps are very well done. However, in attempting to explain the geological structure of Palestine the author begins a paragraph ""millions of years ago..."" Which is to be expected in a secular or mainstream atlas, but here in a Christian text we have the accuracy and historicity of the Genesis account of creation being questioned.Also the atlas has adopted C.E. and B.C.E. dating methods.These things as well as references to Islam as ""tolerant Islam"" or to ""the embracing nature of Islam"" are enough to prompt me to warn conservative Christians.. enjoy the maps but beware the commentary!"
5,Great bag!,I have been working with photography for over 20 years and love to travel. Tamrac Velocity 8x sling pack is the best bag I have ever owned. All my equipment fits perfectly inside. This bag is extremely comfortable to carry and easy to access all items. I highly recommend this pack.
2,bad design,"They tried to make it sleek and modern looking but the result is the round bottom keeps you from ever setting it down without it falling over.Sometimes you just want to set it down to access your camera or accessories and it falls over. Other than wearing it you can not conveniently get at anything.There are times when you want to put it on a table while you do something and bloop over it goes. If they had just made it with a square bottom I would have loved it. The tapered sided also keeps you from storing accessory lenses along side the main camera, at least lenses of medium length. Construction is great, comfort is great, and as a swing to the front quick access bag it is also great. it's just a pain any time you take it off. Laying it flat on it's back works ok but it is a pain to access your gear that way."
3,Disappointing,"My Tamrac Velocity is something of a disappointment. The plusses are that it is comfortable to carry, and access to the camera is quite nice. It is quick to flip the thing from your back to the front to get the camera out.The minus is that even though I purchased a large bag (Velocity 8X), it is very difficult to carry and access any additional equipment. The only access to the bag is from the top. Any additional lenses are buried in the bottom of the bag, making it necessary to dig apart the velcro flaps that keep the camera suspended to get at anything. I carry a Canon XSI with a 28-105 lens and hood, with a spare 100-300 telephoto and a 12-20 wide angle. The spare lenses are virtually inacessible when jammed down into the bottom of the pack and sealed in by the velcro flaps.This is a good pack if all you want to have access to is your camera. If that's the case, buy a small one."
3,Not as Roomy as I Thought,"I thought the 9x would be too large for my needs (Canon 40D body, 70-200 f/2.8L IS USM, 17-55 f/2.8 USM, and Kenko 1.4x teleconverter) so I went with the 8x. Everything fits, but I have to do to much rearranging depending on the lens that is mounted to the body. As a sling, the strap cuts into my shoulder -it's much more comfortable as a shoulder bag. I wish it had some outside pockets."
2,tamrac 8x,I would not recommend buying this bag it is small inside. I have canon 5D and canon flash light and 3 canon lenses and I barely fit them inside beside that this bag become heavy and very uncomfortable on your back.
2,Who tests these camera bags?,"This camera bag barely serves its function. I am at happy at least that I purchased the larger bag, because it does not hold too much. and due to its design, the contents of the bag are accessed through the top, so one has to stack accessories and it becomes quite cumbersome when having to search for things that are on top of eachother. The small zipper front holds only flat items and barely a wallet or cell phone. The shoulder strap buckle is very uncomfortable against my chest, so I am constantly adjusting it. Being new to the camera hobby, I was hoping that this bag would fit my needs, but I quickly realized that was no excuse...I should have opted for a backpack type bag where access is easier."
4,Great bag for the professional,"The Tamrac 5768 Velocity 8X Pro is a durable, roomy bag for carrying a zoom lens and your other gear. Its uniqueness is its ability to be moved from back to front quickly. My husband is a wildlife photographer and he finds the Velocity 8x the perfect size to transport lenses on the trail and still not be burdened by bulk. Worth noting: if other items are not carried, the bag will accommodate a digital camera fitted with a 300mm lens."
3,Not as good as I thought it was going to be,"I agree with some of the things the author says in this book, but many other things he says, including stories he tells seem a bit Hollywood horror movie-ish to me. Many of the stories he tells are so out of this world that they are hard to believe, which makes me wonder if I can trust the rest of the book. I think I will search for another book by a more reliable author."
3,its ok for the price,"it does the job, very easy to use. its kind of big but i guess they are all this size, its very loud sounds like your dish washer is on in the kitchen and it gets kind of annoying so im not sure if all the dehydrators out there are as loud as this one."
5,if u wanna make hommeade beef jerky - get it!,"i wanted to make my own beef jerky cuz the storebought stuff is way too expensive IMO. i love this thing... IT REALLY DOES WORK!!! easiest and best way to go:get a $10 dollar slab of lean london broilget a bottle of Stubb's beef marinade. cut the meat into strips about the thickness of 2 slices of bacon, and marinade it overnite.then slap the suckers on the trays. let the machine run on HI for 4 hrs, then check for moisture.. thats it! if u like jerky and your cheap like me... get this thing"
1,Yucky product,"I do not like this dehydrator, it does not work worth a damn. Over 24 hours for some apples. Please, what a crummmmmmmy appliance!"
4,Dehydrator,I ordered the Nesco Snackmaster and extra trays when my apple tree over produced. The unit has worked flawlessly for nearly two months now. I'm looking forward to doing rollups for grandkids now. Why order the expensive units when an economical one will do?
5,works like a charm,Very happy with this product. Right out of the box it worked as advertised. Seems well made. Give an A for a rating
4,NESCO Food Dehydrator,"The dehydrator is limited but one gets what one pays for. We enjoy using it - it is easy to clean and is small enough that it stores easily. Have not tried it for making jerky yet, but looking forward to that. So far we have had good experiences making crackers from raw seeds and spicing them up to taste. Good unit for the casual user - would have to upgrade to a larger unit to turn out larger quantities in a single time as opposed to repeating the process. Overall we are satisfied at the moment."
5,Great product!,"I was initially going to buy the a cheaper model made by the same company, but was swayed by the positive reviews for this model. I have no complaints so far as the dehydrator does what it advertises. It is very quiet which was a surprise and it's easy to clean up (if you don't let it crust overnight in the sink.) I've dried tomatoes, apples, and flax crackers in it so far. I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend it!"
3,Need a fan?,"I have had both types of dehydrators, the kind that have a fan and blow the warm air and the kind with a coil and use convection. I had expected the blower type to cut down on drying time and while this product works well, I don't know that the fan adds value by reducing time. Addtionally, its kind of hot and perhaps its just over cautious, however I feel careless leaving it plugged in and on the counter overnight and with something like herbs even taking 24 hrs to dry, makes it necessary."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I asked my husband for a dehydrator for my birthday. He bought this one and I absolutely love it!!! It works great and I can make beef jerky in about 4 hours!!! Awesome dehydrator!
5,Not bad for the price!,"I bought this as a present for my dad. He has always wanted a jerky maker. He's a hunter so has a lot of deer meat that he wanted to make jerky with. So, I searched and searched. This one had some great reviews and went out on a limb and bought it. Boy was I glad I chose this one. He made some Deer and Beef Jerky. He said it was the best jerky he ever tasted. And it only took 5 hours for the beef and 7 hours for the deer. He can't wait to get some more seasoning to make another batch. And he's excited to make some dried fruit. So, I really recommend the product."
5,awesome jerky maker,I bought this dehydrator for my son's 26th birthday--he's been keeping us in jerky every since. Works great.
1,Dies an Early Death,"My mother in law has a NESCO dehydrator (not this model)...15 years old and still working! I bought the FD-62 (same dehydrator, different branding) and it lasted less than two years with ~45 days of actual use. Called NESCO and was told that I could have it repaired for $30-$45 or replace the powerhead for $42. Seriously? Stay away, because when they say one-year warranty, what they really mean is that they don't expect their product to last much longer that one year. Stay away, unless you rarely plan to use it!"
1,dont believe the pictures,product may be good but the text and pictures are misleading. it is also 13 bucks more costlt than super k or walmart
2,Hate the product does not work as expected.,"I had high hopes but this was a bummer, it sits in my pantry for now before I start to use it in my greenhouse for as planting trays. I tried some apples they remained soft and chewy even after 18 hrs of drying/dehydrating - my son said they were hard to chew and became like chewing gum.I tried juice roll ups and the got juice all over the counter top.Save your money until they can come up with a better quality dehydrator. I bought this on the recommendation of my cousin but it is a waste of money."
2,time charts not right,times in book are way off. unit is verry noisey. other than that it works ok..
2,It's good but...,"I bought it and loved it. The resolution was great, it saved valuable desk space, it has a great look to it, the price was right, and it handled everything I threw at it.But after only 8 days of having it there is a line across the screen about a quarter-way down. It won't go away. After only eight days! I hadn't heard of Microtek monitors before this one but I have to say that my first experience has turned out a poor one."
5,Terrific Monitor - Trouble Free for 4 Years Now!,I purchased this monitor in 2003 for Christmas and it has performed superbly since then. It even made a move from Italy to Florida with me in 2004.Sharp resolution and superb response time. It has done well displaying my desktop (between Windows XP and now Windows Vista) as well as it has played action and sports games.
2,OVER-PRICED,"Good source of information, although graphics, especially maps are unclear. What really bothers me about this book is that it is clearly over-priced. It is a simple paper-back, nothing fancy, all black and white book. I paid about $80.00 last semester (Spring 2007) for the book, a 2006 edition, and now that I tried to sell it back it is obsolete, because they came up with a February '07 edition. This is terrible for us, the students, and I do not encourage teachers to support this money making scam."
1,not good,"I got the worng edition ofr some reason. Instead of getting the third edition which is what I ordered, I got the first editon. I had to buy the book again"
5,Honda CRV Remote,They assisted me with no hesitation and helped get the remote locked into working with my car.Everything went smoothly.Thanks
3,Ok...,"The time it took them to get to me was great. But it would've been nice if they had posted it somewhere that this software does not support Audiovox 8900, which was the reason I got it. I didn't return it, but wish I had of. Other than that this is really great software."
1,MM-8300 data cable software sucks,The data cable is completely useless with this sprint phone because the software from mobile action doesnt work at all.
2,"cable fits phone, but .....","the cable I ordered fit the phone, but I cannot get the software (which you have to go to another website to download) to work. also the mega cd did not arrive with order. no explanation was with the order when it arrived. when I called company they stated there had been problems with cd and it wasn't being sent out. offered a partial credit."
1,Junk Data Cable,"Don't buy this. It doesn't transfer anything. The CD is worthless. It should be rated Zero, but you can't go that low."
4,The Voyage of Patience Goodspeed,"I read this book to my 8 year-old daughter and 6 year-old son and we thoroughly enjoyed it! I enjoyed reading it as much as they enjoyed listening to it. My daughter tried reading the book herself and had some trouble with it as she didn't understand what parts were diary entries and what parts were narration, and also some of he words were a bit old-fashioned--appropriate to the setting, however. But it was really very easy to know what was a diary entry as it was italicized.It's a great adventure and the girl, who is initially dismissed by her father, is the hero."
2,Horrible!,"Perhaps other people would find this book appetizing. But it was truthfully a book meant to be spat out! Patience was rather heroic, though I found her a little dull. The exciting part was when the two bad guys were sent to the jail cell in the ship. That part was long awaited, and not very good when it came. I was confused with organization of the book. I was not sure if everything was a journal or only a few exerpts. I really don't reccomend this book to ANYONE! The other reviewers I believe are strongly mistaken. Don't even look at this embarassing peice of writing!It is like poison on the readers tounge. NOT FOR AVID READERS! DON'T READ IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!"
2,Not the best,"My husband and I coudn't this darn thing to work, when we did it took forever to inflate the tires."
4,Works Well,"It works well and is cheap, which is nice. It is also nice that it is so compact. Be careful though. It hooks onto the stroller but can be easily hit off. We left it on our stroller when left the stroller at the gate at the airport and when we reached our destination it was gone. I am guessing it fell off during all of moving it probably did under the plan or in transition."
1,Do not purchase!,"I have returned this now three times. You are supposed to pry the gray cap off the end, remove the hose inside, screw it into the pump itself and then screw the end of the hose onto the tire valve stem.The problem is that the hose does not screw into the pump. It falls out over and over. I feel a couple of little grooves in the pump for it to grab the hose, but it does not. The pump opening is too big.We were at Disneyland last weekend, one tire was low. The pump delated the tire completely and would not pump air into it at all. Thankfully Disneyland Stroller rental had a compressor ir it would have really been a problem."
2,Doesn't work very well,"This pump is just really hard to get set just right to fill the tire. It's more hassle than it's worth. If you fiddle with it enough, it will work so that's why I gave it more than 1 star. It does the job, but it takes a patient hand."
4,ok I guess,I haven't had a chance to use this yet but I thought that it was supposed to come with a clip that attatches it to the stroller but it did not. So I have to put it in one of the pockets in the stoller.
1,tossed the pitcher and filter in the trash,Tossed both the pitcher and filter in the trash. The pitcher was so covered with the black filter dust I was unable to get the dust out of the pitcher.
3,OK filter but not great,"I read a lot of reviews on Crystal Quest products, and most are positive. A lot of their stuff is expensive; this is probably one of the cheapest items they offer, and it shows. The good side of these filters is they do filter out chlorine and some other chemicals; I am using mine to filter rain water (caught right off the roof, usually put in half gallon containers the same day). Obviously it filters simple sediment with no problem (for me tiny grains of sand from the composite roof), but it does not filter out color (if the rain water is slightly off color when it comes down the roof), so I'm not overly impressed. It takes a while for the water to go through the filter (a few minutes). People have complained that the unit clogs after only a few uses; I have now had that problem,but someone said in one review that if you shake or tap the fiter on a hard surface a few times, it loosens it up to function again. I suggest that if you have clogging problems."
1,Great Magazine BUT....,"I love reading Honda Tuning so when I heard you could a subscription through Amazon, I was jazzed....But its been more that 75 days since I placed my order and I have yet to recieve my first issue. I've ordered magazines before so I know they can take a while... but never more than 2 monthes.Just FYI"
2,The Hitmen Diaries: Charlie Valentine,The Hitmen Diaries: Charlie Valentine - The acting was good but the story like left a lot to be desired.
3,The title change is confusing...,"I know they changed the title to ""Hitmen Diaries: Charlie Valentine"" before the DVD was released. Before it was shown at movie festivals as just ""Charlie Valentine"". I am guessing that there is supposed to be sequels coming up about 'Hitmen'??I wanted to own this DVD because of the co-star Michael Weatherly as Charlie Valentine's son Danny Valentine. He didn't seem to fit in to the storyline very well, since it was about old Chicago (white) gangsters. The scenes between Danny and his father were interesting where Danny was shaved with a straight razor by his Dad in order to make him ""look sharp"" - and dress sharp and drive a sharp car ""'cuz that way they will respect ya"". The ending was set up to redeem Charlie and have him save his son's life. Hence a sequel about Danny Valentine next? There was way too much emphasis on violence - car chases, gun play, beating up people, etc. That was pretty boring.Weatherly is a great talent (see NCIS) but was wasted in this flick."
5,Great movie!!!,I love Michael Weatherly!!!!!!! When I heard he was in this movie I had to get it because I am a huge fan and I love watching him in NCIS!!! Great movie full of drama and action and Michael did super good as the bad boy!! :)
5,review,this is a really good movie. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys crime movies. it's a good father-son movie.
3,very nice but has what I see as a big flaw,"This is really a very nice kit for beginners as well as knitting to go since most projects are smaller. The 25 projects are all super nice or cute. BUT as a long time crocheter [and a knitter of just a few years] with this kit, what I consider as the big flaw and perhaps an oversight is that all yarn measurements are listed as # of balls/skeins and # of grams/ounces. If there is any yard lengths mentioned on the back of the cards; it is not noted if this is total yards or per skein/ball. I can only say of my own yarn purchasing experience - I do not buy any yarn by the weight; I do however check the yard length which insures that I will have enough yarn to make any project."
5,A useful tool for kntting teachers everywhere,"Every Friday I teach a small class of 2nd- 6th graders the art of knitting. Initially, I had a hard time finding patterns for the children that were quick, easy to read, and most important...FUN! The children love the cards that come in the kit because they can stand them up on the table in front of them. This saves these newbie knitters from having to put down their work to check a pattern. Also, it includes kid friendly patterns like the head kerchief, child's halter top, and the beer cozy, which we use for our Cokes instead! The skill level ratings on the cards are great as well, because they help the kids decide which patterns are feasible for them. If you have a child who wants to learn how to knit, this is the perfect starting kit."
4,"A ""Treasure Chest"" Of Fun Easy Knitting Projects!","Fun & Colorful packaging and easy to follow instructions. I purchased this to start off my fall season of knitting and get ahead on some holiday gifts. In fact I think this kit makes a great gift (with a ball of bright colored yarn!) for someone looking to start knitting without purchasing a book full of ""How-To Knit""....The circular needles are not the best for a beginner however, they do the trick! Im giving my friends that have been asking me to teach them to knit this kit for Christmas with an item knitted from one of the patterns! The patterns are fun with something for everyone!"
3,Just so-so for this beginner,"I still needed to do a web search for knitting how-to videos to fully understand how to cast on and knit stitch. After I'd completed a dozen or so rows of my dish cloth, the circular needles that came with the kit broke. They were a bit cumbersome anyway, but I was disappointed. I guess I'll buy new needles and start over.I did like the assortment of projects with varying levels of difficulty. I know it will be helpful to me that the patterns are written out rather than abbreviated like most you find."
3,Excellent gift for a beginner knitter,"I did not like this Kit since I found the designs very basic and some were not particularly practical. However; for the beginner knitter it would be an excellent gift. I did like the scarf pattern and the baby hat. Plus, the designs are well written and convenient to put with the project."
3,The best volume of the series...,"All the worms hatch out as the series draws to a conclusion. Perhaps the best aspect of the wrap is the revelation that there is no real honor, innocence or selflessness in any of the 'love' situations. Almost everything shrouded as 'love' is either selfish desire or hope of controlling others through deception. DVD 4 offers far more sexual proximity between Tounma and Urara while everyone comes closer to discovering what they want in life. The ending is bittersweet with a simultaneously uplifting message about self reliance, while being rather depressing in its statements about love and intimacy. Personally, I liked the fourth volume best although it'll make the tenderhearted fans cry and wish for something rather lighter and more mundane for a conclusion. If you have followed the series thus far, this is definitely worth while."
1,This book is pathetic!,"This book is an informational pamphlet that unbelievably someone paid to have bound with a hardcover. The book is only 23 pages, with about 3-4 pages of photos and is not worth a red cent. There are absolutely no investment strategies included, contrary to the title. I returned my copy after I read the first three pages. Caveat Emptor!"
4,"Great, quick read of the process of legal analysis.","In this book Levi gives an overview of the process of legal analysis and demonstrates how legal ""rules"" are made. The book consists of primarily 3 parts. In the first part Levi demonstrates the process of legal reasoning in case law situations by tracing the history and development of the ""inherently dangerous"" rule. The second part is an examination of statutory interpretation, specifically the Mann Act. Finally, is a section on constitutional interpretation. This book is not for pre-law students it will offer the most once the reader has already been introduced to the basics of the law and legal reasoning."
2,A pain to read,"The prose is utterly unclear in terms of jargon, structure, and concepts. The author makes some good points, but nothing revolutionary and certainly convoluted in his examples. If this extended essay weren't required reading, I would not have made it to page 5. This reader questions whether some of its expounded 'truths' aren't outdated in their entirety since law and society have developed much since the late 1940s."
4,Good Old Iron,"Peter Hunn's book; ""The Old Outboard Book"" is enjoyable reading for either the casual outboarder to the avid collector. The background of the old 'kickers' is interesting and informative. Peter lists motors that are common today to the private labels of days gone by. His chapter that he devotes to appraising all the old models assists the would be buyer to the collector as to what that old iron could be worth. He takes into account condition on a 5-point scale that is realistic in arriving at an estimate.The chapter on care, repair, and running could have gone into more depth. In this area he could likely writer another book on how to restore an antique motor.Overall, it is worth the investment, and is a good resource."
4,Good source,"Here is a good source for information for the avid collector or the casual observer. The book covers the history of models with some wonderful original photos. It also gives a thumbnail appraisal of what that old iron may be worth, taking into account the possible condition it may be in at present.Mr Hunn devotes a chapter on care, repair, and operation that could be expanded upon to aide in restoration. He has provided enough to get you started but could write another book ""Restoreing The Old Iron"". It would be good to follow the step by step from locating, repairing and refinishing.All in all, ""The Old Outboard"" is a good investment."
5,Very funny,This is a pretty good video to watch when you need a laugh. There were some of his funny moments that I would have liked to have seen on the dvd that weren't there. The video for idiot boyfriend makes it worth the purchase though.
4,I love Jimmy!,But the majority of the time he only made the audience laugh because he himself couldn't keep a straight face.I have brought this DVD twice though because I think Jimmy is cute and I think he is funny when he wants to be.

1,Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys brain aneurysms!,"Jimmy Fallon is about as funny as a dead person. Dead people aren't funny.His ironic-hipster-slacker-cokehead routine (and yes, he does coke in real life at Manhattan clubs and gets in rowdy fights all the time) is totally obnoxious. He makes Adam Sandler look like a comedic genius.And talk about an attention-craving whore. He ruins every single SNL gag he's ever been on with his outbursts of laughter at his own joke.The whole ""shy embarrassed but lovable goof who laughs at his own jokes as part of his lovable shtick"" thing isn't lovable. In fact it's despisable.The fact that he got a Best-Of and other classic SNL comedians have not is a sad fact."
1,"If I could give it a zero, I would...","First of all, let's be honest. Jimmy Fallon is not funny! Have you seen Taxi? Have you seen Fever Pitch? How he got so much notoriety on SNL is beyond my comprehension. He is basically an Adam Sandler wannabe who tries really hard to say something witty and fails every time. He's like a promising young rookie who never really lives up to the hype. Sure, he has enthusiasm but let's not mistake that for comedic talent. It boggles my mind that stellar SNL cast members such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short don't have a BEST OF collection but they made one for this moron. Bypass this one and pick up BEST OF CHRIS KATTAN or TRACY MORGAN if you are looking for some of the newer cast members."
1,"Fallon terrible, live studio audience terrible.","I think it's beyond question if you're a SNL fan - Jimmy Fallon sucks. I really believe Lorne Michaels thought he was funny for some reason and really let him get away with being terrible. I blame Lorne Michaels and the live studio audience for continuing to ""reward"" Fallon by clapping and going crazy every time he broke character. I never understood why the audience thought it was so great, it was funny when SNL members did it in the past because they did it only rarely; maybe once a season. Fallon cracks himself up every skit and the audience laughs and claps, so in Fallon's head he learns that when he breaks character he will get laughs, and so he did it over and over and over again. Terrible. If you bought this DVD you're sad."
1,"Oh man, where's my 'best of' Joe Piscapo DVD, jerks!","Please, I want to see just how tarnished the image of SNL can get. Not that I won't place this gem next to Fever Pitch in my collection, even though I keep em in alphabetical order and I don't own Fever Pitch, or Taxi (The movie), because I don't like Jimmy Hit-and-Miss Fallon. Marvel as he stumbles over lines and laughs out loud inappropriately. It's part of his charm some say. Well if Eddie Murphy had flubbed like that, he would have been out the door, and the back door too, cause Lorne Michaels hates black people.Well, people of all colours UNITE in your hatred of the white-bread Fallon and his modern slaveowner Michaels as they plunge NBC's late-night status down the tubes so people can watch Comedy Central or that Cartoon Network with the newfangled Adult Swim doohickie! Yahhhh!"
1,It Must Suck Trying to be Adam Sandler,"This guy is not very funny. The only skits I found remotely funny were the ones where he tries to be Boston Red Sox fan but now it seems that he just wants to be Adam Sandler. Think about it, he plays the guitar and he has a new movie out with Drew Barrymore. How much more Adam Sandler can you get?"
1,"Jimmy Fallon sucks, get Christopher Walken","Jimmy Fallon is quite possibly THE worst actor ever to appear on SNL. It's not that hard to notice him cracking up in the middle of a sketch. I personally sigh and turn off the TV as soon as I see him enter the sketch because I know he'll just ruin it. If you want a really good SNL best of DVD, Dana Carvey, Christopher Walken, and the Chris Farley tribute are three of the best. I have always been a huge SNL fan, but I hate Jimmy Fallon and he's solely responsible for the recent decline of the show."
1,Jimmy Subliminal Fallon,"This is how Jimmy Fallon works: take a mediocre skit. Allow Jimmy Fallon to act in it. Proceed to let Jimmy Fallon crack up incessantly during the filming despite the dress rehearsals filmed hours prior to the show. By this time, the audience has fallen for Fallon's trick: he laughs while filming an SNL skit so it must be funny so now the audience laughs. Jimmy Fallon has subliminally implanted the idea that he is funny into your minds by laughing at his own lame skits! OILA! THE BEST OF JIMMY FALLON! Instead of buying this DVD, please contribute to the Buy Jimmy Fallon A Comb and Some Hairspray And Send Him Back To Acting School Fund."
5,Lexar Platinum II 2 GB CompactFlash Memory,"Actually I just got this card today, so I can't give a long term report but I did check it's speed in my camera. My camera is a Sony A100 SLR, (Alpha). It takes 10 Megapixel pictures. Using this card it took 25 pictures in 10 seconds with no noticeable hesitation. The card I bought with the camera, (PQ1, 1GB Hi-speed 40), is no doubt faster than a standard card, but it only took 20 shots in in 10 secs. I know there are faster cards on the market, but I was happy with the 25 shots in 10 seconds. I hope this will give an indication of what this card will do."
1,Would love to review it,I have not yet received this item. Left word with the seller requesting shipping/tracking info. That not yet received either. Any ideas how to proceed?
2,Fuhgetaboutit,I used this card for 6 months when it died of natural causes! Had to take it back. I suppose things happen! I just upgraded to the Pro 133x Lexar card...we'll see what happens. I'm hopeful.
1,Terrible!,"I thought this would look so cute in the flower bed that our in-ground sprinkler system couldn't reach. It did look cute, but it didn't work at all. I thought that it would attach directly to our garden hose, but instead you have to attach a very thin tube to the garden hose and then to the sprinkler itself. I probably put it together incorrectly, but there were no directions enclosed with the sprinkler. The tube kept coming undone from the body of the sprinkler when I turned the water on the slightest bit. If this item had cost more, I would have been very upset."
2,Good idea but only works for a short time,I bought one last year and it is still working but the 4 subsequent turtles I purchased do not work. The drip line does not stay connected for very long even with tiny zip ties! I am very disappointed.
3,turtle sprinkler,A lot smaller than I had hoped. It's a cute turtle and honestly I don't know how it works til Spring because it was a Christmas present.
4,Nice for baby,"The item was a little smaller than I expected, but it was soft and the music was cute. I think it's perfect for the 1 year old I bought it for and goes well with a Fire Engine theme."
3,Heavy grade vinyl,I was fortunate to get this here for $45 w/ FS vs. the $75 plus shipping Mantis sells it for on their website. It is a nice grade vinyl cover made to fit the composter vs. throwing a tarp over it as I had done. I just don't know how long it will hold up and think it is a bit overpriced. Of course I thought the composter was overpriced too even after getting another great deal on it through Amazon.
4,A Memoir of Two Wars,"John Falk takes the reader on the journey of his escape from depression. And while medicine plays a key part in his freedom, we also see how a brutal and bloody war also plays a role.His description of his illness is juxtaposed nicely against teh atrocities of war and his insights into himself and the war are poingant.A good read."
4,It's a nice addition,"Love the studs, it adds to it. Overall not as shiny as expected but none-the-less beautiful."
2,Ultimate Barbie Doll Book,"This book is NOT the Ultimate Barbie Doll Book. I could not find a single collectible Barbie Doll which I posses from the years it describes it covers when I purchased it. Description of the dolls covered should really be more detailed for collectors who are new to the industry. In addition, there is no option to select from Amazon if the item described does not meet your needs, you simply get a refund, minus shipping as a user error...Not too fair in my opinion."
5,Ultimate identification guide,"This is the best Barbie identification book out there. It's useful to identify those thrift store and garage sale dolls and their outfits. Each item is also described with identifying marks, etc. I have owned this book since it came out and it's the one I go back to the most, for complete Barbie information."
5,This is a Beautiful Barbie Doll Book,"I love my new Ultimate Barbie Doll Book. I still have my first Barbie Dolls from the early 60's along with Ken, Midge & Skipper. I have over 100 dolls and found them all in this wonderful book. The photos are beautiful. The Barbie novice to enthusiast will truly enjoy this book."
3,Lucky??,"Irene Small has written a host of children's stories on various topics. In BECAUSE YOU'RE LUCKY, she introduces us to Kevin who has come to stay with his cousin's family empty-handed. His cousin Jonathon gives him a hard time from the very beginning because he doesn't like that he has to share everything with Kevin, so he lashes out at Kevin and questions his mother. She teaches him that families are always there for each other and ""lucky"" to be able to learn new things about each other.This is a simple book with nice illustrations, however, I wasn't too sure I liked the title of the book. Children may get the impression that getting their basic needs met is a matter of luck vs the intended message, which I interpreted as Jonathon being lucky because he had Kevin as a cousin and a friend. Additionally, I felt the book left a few areas open that should have been addressed; specifically the relationship Kevin had with his older cousin Dawn."
5,Essential for Advantix cassette storage,"Have you ever needed a reprint of a photo only to find yourself digging through boxes, closets, envelopes, etc. looking for the roll of film? Chances are, if you found the roll, the index print was no where to be seen. Sound familiar?This product is the most simple solution for film cassette and index print storage! The case is similar to a videotape clamshell and holds twelve film cassettes, as well as their index prints. Locating a specific photo is very easy with these organizers! I am an avid scrapbooker and these have been essential tools for storing my film. They are also a great way to protect your film and index prints from dust, sunlight, and moisture."
2,Borders on being a toy.,"You can (and should) do a lot better than this in a digital camera at this price. It has a rather low resolution, a fixed focus lens, no zoom, and no USB connectivity. Anyone interested in simple digital photography will very soon be looking for a more advanced camera, while the SDC-80 gathers dust in a drawer. If you want cheap, look at the JamCams; if you want easy, look at the Sony Mavicas or the ""Kodak Easy Share"" packages."
2,what do you want for the price?,"You get what you pay for. I have had mine for about six months and have all sorts of trouble with it.Because I moved overseas after buying it, my warranty is no longer valid so I am stuck with an unusable camera (...)"
5,Really great digital camera,"Not only is the design great, but it's a great digital camera all-around. The LCD screen is a very nice feature, and the design is great. I like how te flash is detachable, making it more compact whenever you want. I liked this camera so much I regularly buy it for birthday presents."
4,There was only one Sylvester...!!,"I remember Sylvester well, having seen him perform in LA. it had been years since I'd thought of him, when I chanced upon this CD, which had been part of a documentary I saw on Sylvester's life & career. So I thought, ""Why not??"". I'd had the album years ago, but hadn't realized there was a CD. What??!!??! Time passes folks!! The layers pile one on top of the other!!! Then, one day, you're old enough to slow down, to hell with achieving, and as the dust starts to settle, you start remembering the moments in all that time that has passed that you actually enjoyed. Sylvester was definitely one of those moments in my life. So glad I bought this CD...I play it sometimes on my morning drive to the office & just float away..."
2,only for 1 song,"is a concert & i don't like live music, but i'm accustomed to buy all the albums of singers that i like. at the end of the album is the 12"" version of can't stop dancing; but you can get that in any of his greatest hits albums; so in total, only for the very fans of sylvester."
2,Disappointing,"This CD's sound quality is mediocre at best and the whole performance is a mish-mash of ""hits"" and misses. I really wanted to hear ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"", among Sylvester's other big hits. This CD is not the one to choose if you want to hear these (especially in their extended versions). I feel like I wasted my money on this one."
2,disappointing,"Fully expected to love this album but found the production too low-fi and the music treatment not focused enough. Sylvester rules, but this live set doesn't capture his talent on CD."
1,I wouldnt buy a philips product,The front of my 2 month old Philips television is seperating from the back. Who knew that you could get such shoddy workmanship for such a high price. If you want to get quality for your money stay away from Philips and definetly dont buy anything expensive from them or Best Buy because the service after the sale is just as shoddy. I would have given it a no star but that was not an option.
2,For architects or the coffee table,"The book focuses on very modern designs, which are frequently stark or very heavy on the glass and steel. There are some ideas for creating a ""greener"" house, but most of the examples ignore the most basic green principle of minimizing the square footage of the house. Also, with a few exceptions, most of the examples appear to be very pricey."
5,THE FOUR AGREEMENTS to live by,"After reading THE FOUR AGREEMENTS and recapturing what I had learned to friends & family I ordered 5 of these charming petites so that I could share Mr. Ruiz's knowledge. They are wonderfully convenient to carry along with you everyday as a reminder of the proper way to think and live.I will definately order more of these tiny little gems and highly recommend the same for everyone who reads this.I'm very happy with Amazon.com. It's always the first place I look when I need help finding a product.Thank you, Mal"
5,Great gift!,"I bought these as a gift for a friend who doesn't enjoy reading very much, and she loves them."
5,Four Agreements,"Excellant book. I highly recommend it. To read them is easy,to live them is the challenge."
2,Not what I was expecting,"For some reason, I thought this was a full-sized book when in fact it's a teeny little memento decorative gift edition version. Page numbers and dimensions of the cover would have helped determine that this was not what I had in mind. But now I know what it meant by ""charming petites"". Ah well."
4,beautiful artwork and words,"I enjoyed the book ""The Four Agreements"" and was delighted to discover these cards. I had to wait a while to receive these because they had gone on backorder, but it was worth it. They are like vitamins for the soul. I have the deck nearby to read whenever I need to be lifted up or inspired. The artwork is exquisite."
4,So cute,This is a great little book and it fits right into my purse. It's a nice inspiration to carry with me. It's even intriguing to my 4 year old.
5,Love This Book,so glad this is on kindle now. recommended for anyone seeking to really understande what it is to live in grace. life isnt a struggle or it shouldnt be. get this book and rest
5,For Anyone and Everyone,"Whether you're sitting on top of the world or down in the dumps, deeply spiritual or wandering lost in doubt, rich beyond belief or wondering where your next meal is coming from, there is something in this book for you: a way to shift your point of view to live life to the hilt, unencumbered by negative thought and the worries you've always considered the natural consequences of living life on Earth. Living In Grace is a practical guide to finding the good in everything you experience and everyone you meet, helping you turn the events and relationships in your life into positive building blocks on the road to your becoming the happy, creative person you've always wanted to be."
4,Practical Spirituality,"This nondenominational guidebook for spirituality is full of practical ways each of us can use daily to improve our life and the lives of others. I have enjoyed trying out the ideas and watching them work in my life!The author gives lots of examples of events and observations from her own life and from other people (often with humor) -- some of them I'll never forget. And the GRACIOUS mnemonic is a great way to focus one's thought on what's good and true in order to change our circumstances for the better.I especially like the fact that each chapter has a section on practical applications, plus a place for exercises to do, which you can use again and again -- and they really do work!It's true: Whatever we perceive to be true magnifies. The author explains this in many different ways until it really makes sense -- not merely philosophically, and not with any religiosity, but in practical terms."
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"It's ""Wicker Man"" lite - really lite. Change the time period and the location (slightly) and add predictable storyline with really bad acting and you'll spend more time ""ff"" than watching/dozing. Disjointed storyline where plot lines appear and disappear without explanation. To describe it as humor or satire is simply attaching a tag without any supporting evidence.An American, soon to be married, vacationing couple encounter some UK villagers who need a virgin sacrifice to counter the sterilizing effects of a nearby nuclear plant's sterilizing radiation.A low budget of locals, probably offered $100, to put a few squiggles of paint on their exposed upper bodies and asked to carry a few torches to a wicker bonfire. The rest of the budget is the location prop of a big manor and a couple of horses to ride around on. That's it, you've seen the whole movie. When the one person dies it's all off screen - you see nothing and was as anticlimactic as watching water boil on the stove."
2,Some things are best left alone,"A film maker cannot tether his sequel/companion piece/whatever we're calling this to a film as notorious/beloved/classic as ""The Wicker Man"" without inviting comparison, so the ""let it stand on it's own"" philosophy goes out the window.If this was supposed to be a black comedy, it falls short. Horrifying? Nope. Certainly not original, there's nothing new here.It IS beautifully shot, it's bittersweet to see Christopher Lee put in an appearance, but in all, it feels like they phoned this one in and collected a check."
1,"Mercifully short, beautifully photographed.","I would just like to throw in my (cowboy) hat with the voices on this page telling you to avoid this movie.The Wicker Man (2006) (Rated and Unrated) [Blu-ray] is now only the second worse remake/sequel to the superlativeThe Wicker Man (Limited Edition)1973 original.There won't be anything I can write that will stop the curious among you from looking into this poorly scripted train wreck, but it will suffice for me to say that if it were ever possible for a sequel to lessen the impact or harm the reputation of the original, this is that film.The wooden acting and pointless plot developments are not even the most disappointing part. The real kicker is just how competently assembled the film is. Stunningly photographed and well edited, the terrible script and questionable casting stick out even more and underline just how disappointing the whole thing truly is."
1,VERY BAD MOVIE,"I love the Wicker Man so if you do too, this movie completely ruins everything ""The Wicker Man"" stood for. BAD ACTING and BAD PRODUCTION, not even the pagan story we all know and love can save this mess of a film."
1,The Wicker Tree,"Slow, dull, wordy, anticlimactic movie that needed a burst of action and energy, the music couldn't even save this mess, Hardy disappointed me with this movie after the The Wicker Man was such a great movie, I guess he lost his touch after 40 years. Waste of time movie that's not half the original Wicker Man is, makes the remake look like Shakespeare."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I give this movie my view of worst movie ever not because of its premise, or its goal. I give this movie the title of ""Worse Movie Ever"" because of its rotten casting of the two american parts by two of the worse actors i have ever seen in a film and their horrible peformances.I had a houseplant that was smarter and had more personality than the guy that plays the American Cowboy, and the girl, supposedly some great singing star, is lackluster at best, with barely a half-octave range. Remember, these are the two characters that we are suppose to share this journey with, and one cannot even stand to be near them for 5 minutes.Casting is half the battle in creating a film, and in this case, The Wicker Tree never had a chance from frame one. A waste of money and time."
1,TREE OF DEATH,"If THE WICKER TREE is intended as a black comedy, it misses the mark. If the WICKER TREE is meant to be a horror film, it falls very short. Having little to do with the cult classic WICKER MAN, this movie is a dull, flaccid offering, failing to generate any significant response.Main problem is the casting of Brittania Nicol and Henry Garrett in the leading role of the clueless young couple who find themselves prey for the religious cult. They are simply awful. Respected character actors Graham McTavish and Janice Richardson can't escape the banal dialogue and horror icon Christopher Lee is wasted in a brief appearance. Honeysuckle Weeks exudes primal sexuality to compensate for her limited thespian talents.Writer/director Robin Hardy has fashioned a trite and lifeless film, devoid of any real suspense."
1,The Wicker Tree,"Don't waste your money on this one. It is by far one of the most stupid movies I've ever wasted my money on. It starts out stupid, hoped it would get better. But NOOOOO. It got worse as it went along. Am taking it to Hastings to try to get a dollar or two for it. (I hope)."
5,Pressure sore relief,"I came out of a leg cast after six weeks with a Stage I pressure sore on my heel and some very tender traumatized skin on my ankle. This cream has been very effective in soothing and healing the traumatized skin, the surgical scar areas, and the pressure sore. There has been a significant diminishment in heel and skin redness/tenderness, as well as a relief of the ""burning sensation"" on the ankle skin. The skin is now soft and much more comfortable. I'm applying at 3x a day after range-of-motion exercises, and one final time before bed.There really is no added fragrances for those who need unscented products. The smell is faint and pleasant. The texture is creamy without being greasy. The 4 oz jar will probably last 2 months or more using it 4x's a day. I would definitely recommend and buy this cream again."
5,Great product!,"My 92 year-old mother has been using this product for 2 years now. It has helped the dry, sore areas on her skin tremendously. Nice cream, slight pleasant smell. Would recommend this product for anyone."
1,Awful,"I have sensitive skin and rosacea, and my face is burning. I even tried it twice and the same tingling and then burning sensation, and it doesn't go away, had to wash face again. However, used on my arms and elbows and worked great, must be some ingredient in it that is just too sensitive for face."
1,Not impressed,"I had high hopes for this cream but have been disappointed. It is very thick and seems rich. When I put it on my hands and feet, they feel softer. However, after washing my hands, they seem ever drier than before I applied the cream. Same with my feet. I see no improvement from using the cream but have experienced increased dryness."
1,Nothing but a very rich cream,"I thought I would give this product a fair time to work. Using it everyday, atleast 3 times a day for more than 2 weeks, so far there are no positive results. It is a very rich cream but doesn't improve my skin quality at all...even on the non-eczema parts. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Horrible!!!!,"This product does not work at all. As a matter of fact, it makes your skin more dry. I bought this because I have dyshidrotic dermatitis on my hands. TriDerma made it much worst causing me to seek immediate medical attention. I showed my doctor the cream and she told me to stop using it because it was garbage. For itchy problems, just go to your local drug store (CVS, WALGREENS, RITEAID) and buy Aquaphor. This is the ONLY thing that has helped me along with manicure gloves. I put Aquaphor on at night and sleep with the gloves and my hands are nearly healed. Trust me! I can thank Dr. Collins for this one!"
3,it real decent!,the cd real decent dread! it have styles from way back that yuh cyah find on cd's these days.
5,easy to read with practical advice,"good parenting tips, realistic examples and scenarios, all in all a good book to have on the shelf. The best idea from the book is that all parents should start with a 10 year plan for what their goals are for their children's behavior.....this is a practical idea that really helped us to begin a discussion about how to parent our energetic 2 year old."
2,It's not Photoshop Elements 7,"Don't make the mistake I did when I saw Photoshop 7 and thought it was Photoshop Elements 7. Although an excellent book, it is over 7 years old and most techniques can't be followed in Photoshop Elements 7."
2,Disappointing,"Disjointed and seemingly written for the Windoze only crowd, give this book a pass and spend your money more wisely elsewhere."
2,Not the best guide available,"This course is better than nothing, and was the best available when originally published. However, the Colloquial Lithuanian guide is better.My friends in Vilnius say that the woman narrating most of the tapes has an American accent, and that the Colloquial Lithuanian narrator has a better accent (not that I can tell!)."
5,My kitten is a soccer star!,"My female kitten loves these soccer balls. She entertains herself with them throughout the day, at random, without any help from me or her fellow kitten. The cloth on these seems to fade a bit but then again I suppose that the cloth has been through a lot: She chases and knocks the balls all over the place and under furniture and is often seen carrying one around in her mouth before dropping it to the floor and playing with it very aggressively. I'm very happy with these because it amuses me to watch her play with them, and I can tell that they are her favorites."
5,cat loves these,"She bats them around and chases them. She places them as booby traps where I walk in dangerous trippy places like at the bottom of the basement stairs, or by the bathroom door trying to trip me up.So that must mean they are extra cat fun for the cat."
2,What is Ethical about these balls?,"Ordered these because they call them ""ethical"" and I hoped that maybe they weren't made in China or used recycled material or anything that would be more green than the regular toys I buy at the pet store. Well, they are the same made in China by Spot foam soccor balls. Nothing ethical about them. I did get to pay more to ship them then the balls themselves cost. How ethical ! Contacted company and they couldn't care less. Unless you get free shipping, might as well go to any pet store and buy your cat toys there. Two stars only because they are foam balls and my cats love them."
3,"Not bad, but cats don't really care for them","One of my cats has a favorite shiny, soft ball that is near destroyed, so we decided to get her something new.These soccer balls are soft, and surprisingly bouncy, but smelt very strongly of plastic, out of the bag.They look nice, but cats don't seem to care for them. They are not scared of them, but they don't play with them.It probably would be better to get something with a soft, natural material exterior, and maybe a catnip pouch inside, if you're looking for a cat toy.You'll probably have more fun with these than your cats ;)"
2,Bag is not as describe,i am not satisfied with quality of bag. there is no support inside. not worth to purchase
2,Biased to the left wing view of reality,"The Lincoln Brigade fought ON the side of the Communist Left ( Republicans) and participated in the many attrocities such as executions of the clergy, press,ect. They were funded by Eleanor Roosevelt who was a ""closet"" Communist,trained and sent to Spain to help send Spain into the Soviet orbit."
3,"Cute, but too small..","These shoes are very cute, but they are just too narrow for my foot. If you have even a slightly wider foot, I'd stay away from this shoe. It was also too small in terms of length for me."
3,Friends,"I became very attached to some of the characters. When I found out the first casualty of the earthquake, I felt like I had lost a friend. But what happened to these people at the end of the book?"
3,Interesting book,"Good but need to make the stories fit together. It is as if the people's story was written one by one, then divided up and put together."
