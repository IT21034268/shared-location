5,Can goes ambient?,"Lighter still than the previous rocky-jazzy ""Ege Bamyasi"", this album takes the sound down yet another notch, and adds some almost symphonic feel to arrive at a destination that, to be honest, no one would get back to for perhaps 15+ years. Only Eno was messing around with this sort of merging of ambience and pop music, and even his efforts of this sort (as opposed to his 'pure' ambient works) at the time didn't manage to hit the level of atmospheric sustain as Can manage on the side-long 'Bel Air'. The final Damo Suzuki Can album, this amazing effort ends an arc that begins with the diametrically-opposed aggression of ""Tago Mago"". Also, this should be considered perhaps the most listener-friendly Can album, and is therefore a wonderful starting-point for newcomers to the amazing corpus of Can's work."
2,Closer Than She Thinks,"Although the story had great potential, I found the writing to be unrealistic and cliched. It seemed as though the author wrote this with the hope that it would be made into a movie. It wasn't so bad that I gave up on it, but I wouldn't reccomend spending any money on it."
3,"Okay, but not her best.","I am a big fan of Sawyer's but the couple in this book just didn't have the right chemistry to me. I'm not saying the book wasn't good but it can't compare to ""The Hidaway"" or ""A Kiss in the Dark"" two of my favorites!"
5,Great gloves!,I bought these for a friend for a Christmas present. They were very well made and what you would expect from isotoner.
3,Better than no pinball at all,"Of the several tables included on this cart., only 2 are worth playing: Spirit of 76 and Haunted House. The others are more like pachinko games than modern pinball and aren't worth the effort.This price is right for what you get. I bought this knowing that I couldn't wait for a GBA version to be released."
2,"Well, the PC version is good!","I was really excited when I heard MPA was bing released for gameboy! I love the PC version - it's the only Pinball sim I play now days. The Gameboy version... well, seems like an unfinished product. The only table worth playing is Spirit of '76... which is a saving grace since it just so happens to be my favorite table on the PC version. I no longer play the gameboy version of MPA... just sits in it's box until I decide to get rid of it. I'll stick to Kirby's Pinball or Pokemon Pinball."
1,never made it to my home,The product never arrived to my home. I contacted the seller and they claimed they had shipped it. After several days they realized that the glass jug that contained the product had broken in transit and they were not able to ship a new item to me. The item was on back order. I was unable to wait for a new shipment. They refunded my payment to me. I do not recommend ordering anything that could possibly be breakable or is in a glass container.
5,Essential listening.,"This album has been one of the best musical investments I have ever made. After listening to the CD for the first time, I no longer want to listen to anything else. This is music at its finest. Listen to it with an open mind."
4,Quite An Interesting Head Trip,"It's not the most even record ... of course now that it's available on a single disc (as opposed to 2-LPs) it's an even better value for money.""Paperhouse"" - great rhythmic track with stacked guitars that remind me of Sonic Youth.""Mushroom"" - this does indeed sound like a hip-hop beat in 1971. Pretty great track, sounds like a little echo chamber full of horrors.""Oh Yeah"" - absolutely great groove by the drum 'n bass, while Irmin, Damo, and Michael make a great whirlpool of noise around it.""Halleluwah"" - James Brown-styled groove, carried on a bit too long. Lots of good groovy ideas on here though. Still, I prefer the edit on ""Cannibalism 1"".""Augmn"" - tape manipulation, echo stuff, slowed down, speeded up, magic spells incanted, and a slowed-down drum solo. Strange, headsy, and reminiscent (in a good way) of Stockhausen.""Peking O"" - intentionally chaotic and abstract, but with some groove in it.""Bring Me Coffee Or Tea"" - a crooning song."
1,aimless,"This album is terrible. It's no more than a series of drum & guitar solos that have no melodies or redeeming factors. I wanted to like this album after some compared it to Radiohead, but this is nothing more than self-indulgence and pure & simple: BAD MUSIC. There is no such thing as a lost classic...there is a reason that they are ""lost""."
5,I love Tago Mago,"Can, while not as bizarre as a few of their contemporaries, Faust comes to mind - put together some astonishingly good rock with their talented Japanese lyrical improviser Damo Suzuki.My favorite piece is ""Oh Yeah"" which opens with the sound of a thunderstorm, and the growing rhythm of the drums with organ overlay. The song is a rather long one, and goes through 3 shifts in sound, and subtle tensions. There's also a very fun video of it in YouTube replete with vaudeville style juggler.the later part of the album has some more of the throbbing ""experimental"" aspects to it, with delayed instruments, and heavily distorted vocal bits. IT's very hypnotic and for some may be a bit unnerving.Can and several of the other Krautrock bands were way ahead with their disassembly of pop-rock music, and merging it to free jazz improv. I don't know of anything else like them - their brand was special."
5,I love it,"I absolutely love this cd,always have since it came out.Perfect for a late night listen with headphones.One pretty song after another.The only song i have a problem with is Get on the Right Thing which to my ears anyway,screams for some horns to be blowing hot.I always felt and still do that Little Lamb Dragonfly lyrics were directed towards John.Maybe not but it sure sounds like they are.Whom else would they be for? Single Pigeon is my favorite song on here,well it is today anyway.Loup is fun and the medley is pure Mccartney magic.As now they are adding bonus songs to the cd's great since i spent so much on the singles looking for these back in the early 70's.Great cd one of my favorites along with McCartney, Ram,Band on the Run,Venus and Mars.What i like best is that paul along with the other beatles never bothered to compete with the stuff they did as Beatles.They just did their thing and made some great music.Lucky for us.Peace!"
2,Mediocre McCartney With Strong Bonus Tracks,"""Red Rose Speedway"" (1973) shows Paul McCartney and Wings struggling to take flight before the breakthrough of ""Band on the Run."" It's a sloppy, directionless album that emphasizes McCartney's worst qualities. Only Paul could get away with a ludicrous hit single such as ""My Love."" However, the CD bonus tracks - ""Hi Hi Hi,"" ""The Mess,"" ""I Lie Around"" and the reggae-flavored ""C Moon"" - are consistently strong. McCartney really needs a box set to showcase these hidden gems."
3,"Listenable, but not Paul's best effort","This album, musically, was not as good as its predecessor, ""Ram,"" but it's the kind of album I would put on if I wanted some light, simple rock. The garage-band feel I got from ""Ram"" and the single ""Hi Hi Hi"" are sadly missing here, but it is a good showcase for the band. Not the best McCartney effort, but still good, just the same."
2,A Rose Is Not A Rose,"When people criticize Paul, this is the kind of thing that they target. Almost as if he totally forgot his rock and roll roots."
4,Best use of his Beatle talents until Flaming Pie,"This was PMC's best Beatlesque effort up until his Flaming Pie disc. Backward guitars, hand-claps, nice harrison/lennon sounding ooohs and aaaahs in the background.The bonus tracks are a nice addition too...you'd have to buy 45's from Band on the Run to get these lost b-sides. Not that they're that great, but they are nice to have...kinda like Ringo's Early 1970 b-side. Buy this and enjoy an early 70's romp."
3,"It doesn't have much, but it does have one gem...........","......which is ""Little Lamb Dragonfly,"" arguably one of Sir Paul's best songs from the early Seventies. It's too bad it's on THIS album; if it had been on VENUS AND MARS or even RAM, it stood a good chance of being heard."
3,It's Been a While...,"It took me a while to fall in love with this album. At first listen you're most likely gonna hate it, but give it a chance, kids..."
3,Wings matures with good album,"This is the second Wings album and first chart-topper, containing the smash hit single ""My Love."" Some of the music reminds one of Ram, only a lot better. The cd starts of with ""Big Barn Bed,"" a nice rocker which ends into the smoochy ""My Love."" This is Paul's most sing-a-long-type album, displayed in ""When The Night."" It contains mostly silly love songs with simple lyrics. It has its dull moments, such as ""Get On The Right Thing,"" and the insturmental ""Loup(1st Indian On The Moon)."" The album's finest part is the 11-minute medley that closes the album, similar to Abbey Road's but not as good, but fun nonetheless. Wings obviously matured on this, when compared to the trite Wild Life. The bonus tracks are entertaining, especially ""My Love""'s B-side, ""The Mess."" A good buy altogether."
2,It just not quite there...,"Ya know... I've just now listened to this album for the first time in over twenty years. I have always wanted to like it and I almost do. The musicianship is top-notch, the arrangements are bold and daring, and the production is absolutely first-rate. The problem is the LYRICS. Paul has taken really really strong arrangements and has chosen to sing the most inane and weak lyrics on top of them. Whereas ""Band on the Run"" has great-sounding lyrics, there is just no redeeming lyrical value to this album. That is the difference. Great songs with weak lyrics that really detract from the total package.Sleeping on a big barn bed, lazy dyanamite, my love does it good, power cut (which must mean a loss of electrical power...Baby I love you sobe I love you soBaby I love you soBaby I love you sobe I love you sobe I love you so ...."
2,The Speedway Is Clogged,"Not his best, to be sure. Consists of syrupy Silly Love Songs and minimalistic ideas which go nowhere. He would do better next time."
2,Yucky,"This is one of my least favorite efforts by any Beatle. The treacly nature of this record is best summarized by the hit single therin ""My Love."" A couple of the songs like ""Big Barn Bed"" have a certain home charm, but the LP as a whole is forgettable."
1,Hideous,"The first three songs, Big Barn Red, My Love, and Get On the Right Thing are all good songs. The rest of the album is ABSOLUTE CRAP. A fitting follow up to an even worse album, Wild Life."
3,MY LOVE.......,"I never really got into this lp or cd, my love was great , It had it's rocking moments."
2,Speed Pass This One,"Red Rose Speedway is the worst album in the Paul McCartney & Wings catalog. Mr. McCartney is a supreme songwriter and even the more trite songs in his career are well-crafted. But on this album, most of what he tries, fails. The medley on side two is obvious attempt at receating the Abbey Road medley. While no one would expect it to match up to that, you expect more than what is offered. ""Loup (1st Indian On the Moon)"", ""When The Night"" & ""Single Pigeon"" are among the worst songs of his career. There are some good songs on the album like ""Big Barn Bed"", ""Little Lamb Dragonfly"" and the number one hit ""My Love"". Though that song is often dismissed and criticized, it is what Mr. McCartney does best, simple love songs, well sung and well produced. The bonus tracks include one of Mr. McCartney's best singles, ""Hi Hi Hi"", which is a sprightly rocker that hit number ten but deserved to be another number one."
4,The Gold CD Version,"Beutifull music one of maccas best, but the Gold CD(DCC recording) shows the serious lack of qaulity recording equipment the original must have been recorded on. After listening to the vynal version for many years I'v always wanted a better qaulity recording of this in my view classic album. The vynal version is warm and lacks real detail same as the gold CD. The 4 stars are for the music only. The recording deserves possibly one star. Dont waste money on the gold version."
3,"Not a classic, but not bad","Is this Paul McCartney at his solo apex? Far from it, but this is still an enjoyable album with some enjoyable music on it. ""Big Barn Red"" is one of Paul's more under-rated rockers, and ""One More Kiss"" and ""Single Pigeon"" are insipid but catchy ballads. But the highlight of this album is the little known medley of ""Hold Me Tight, Lazy Dynamite, Hands of Love and Power Cut."" These are four tunes you cannot get out of your mind. similar to Paul's idiotic but melodic ""C Moon"" from 1972. I've been listening to this lightweight but catchy medley for 27 years and still have it on casette in my car.Obviously ""Red Rose Speedway"" can't hold a candle to Paul's classic albums like ""Band on the Run"" or ""Flaming Pie,"" but this still has some nice music on it."
1,"Looking for his worst album? Well, here 'tis!","I agree 100% with the reviewer from Macondo: this is Paulie's worst album ever. Back in '73, I was still thinking it couldn't get any worse than Wild Life, but boy was I wrong. The first track, Big Barn Bed is kinda ok, but it's all downhill from there, and boy the hill is steep and the valley is low. The closing medley is so depressing, I have to lie down in my bed motionless for three days every time I hear it, just to recover. This first expanded edition of Wings was no good, the only good thing they did was disbanding shortly after this disastrous effort. It's funny how in 1973 Ringo, yes Ringo, was the only ex-Beatle to come up with a more or less decent album (check it out!). John delivered Mind Games, one of his least satisfying efforts, and George came up with Living in the Material World, which was only good because it inspired Madonna to sing Material Girl twelve years later."
3,"OK, so, a let down","Nice music by a funny little man. My god, we're talking post-Beatles stuff here...."
2,5 stars? You must be joking!,"Anyone giving this a 5 star rating must be deaf or Paul Mccartney! An artist must be judged against his best work. Is their anything on this album to rival Macca's top tunes? No. Few tracks would have made it on to any Beatles album, not even the worst bits of 'The White Album'. Give me 'Rocky Racoon' anyday! The inclusion of some halfway decent bonus tracks improves things, but 5 stars? His best solo work might make three and a half, ('Flaming Pie', 'Ram', 'Band On The Run'), but red Rose Spedway remains near the bottom."
5,A Romping Delight!,"McCartney's follow-up to ""Ram"" was a delight with several questions. What was he doing? He is all over the place and we still don't care! Again, the massive big hit was ""My Love"", but this collection features two more hits, ""C Moon"" and ""Hi Hi Hi"", the latter being a rockin' pull no punches perfect single. The first five songs are pleasant, typical McCartney, but from ""Single Pigeon"" through the end of ""Medley:..."", McCartney changes moods, chord arrangements, bridges and style so many times, its makes you wonder how many takes it took. It's a romping listening delight. The additional songs, ""Mess"" and ""I Lie Around"" seem frivolous, but they place the album in perspective. Wish this had been remastered as well."
3,An odd transitional period,"With ""Red Rose Speedway,"" McCartney introduced the full lineup of early Wings, which wouldn't last long. Though the musicians are good, they seem to play sluggishly as a unit. There are many good musical ideas and tunes here, but the Medley at the end unfortunately does not hold together with the pacing and finesse of the ""Abbey Road"" medley, to which it invites comparison, and of whom McCartney was the principal architect. Some of the language seems dated now, but it's good fun."
5,"Beautiful music, beautiful interpretation.","Monica Huggett on violin and Richard Savino on guitar delivered us a masterful interpretation of three sonatas of Romanticism epoque full of virtuosity, elegant and beautiful melodies.Mauro Giuliani, who was a virtuoso of the guitar in his time, offers us a Duo Concertante Op. 25 where the violin is magnificent.Paganini - a genius of the violin indisputably - gives us two interesting works: Grand Sonata, where the guitar is played by Savino with extreme creditworthiness and magisterial virtuosity and the Sonata Concertata where both performers don fascinate with its elegance and refined technique. In short, three finely etched Chamber music gems by him seal Harmonia Mundi."
5,Hollywood Classic,"Alot of reviews I see are forgetting...This movie is based in 30's Hollywood time period...Yes it is ""Hollywood"" in parts and maybe the whole movie,but in the 30's, Actors and movies lived out The ""Drama Queen"" life style, it was almost expected. It was about Glamor,Drama,Scandal,Tabloids,Hidden Life Styles,..Over The Top Acting..False Rumors for Publicity sake...Dont compare it to todays Movie Dramas...Back then Clevage was Sexually Bold!..Today we have Total Nudity,for Gratuitous and movie viewing for selling reasons alone...Dont be so hard on this movie, it was made and Directed to create a speciffic Time Period Of many years Long Gone."
1,not that good,"I watched this movie out of curiosity about Jean Harlow, and I kept watching hoping that it would get better...well it didn't."
3,"More of a ""period piece"" than an actual movie!","Although the movie's setting is the 30's, the film is more a reflection of 60's moviemaking complete with Mannix himself Mike Conners, Fox contract player Red Buttons, and Peter Lawford of ""Rat Pack"" fame. Angela Lansbury who had previously played mothers to Laurence Harvey and Elvis Presley, respectively, finds herself in a similar position as mother to Carroll Baker's Harlow. Baker does a fair job as the doomed star, but does not exude the same sexual attraction that made Harlow the object of many men's desires. Overall, the movie holds the interest, but is, by no means, a classic.It does feature a most interesting ""pad"" that belongs to Leslie Neilson, cast as a producer with a lecherous eye. This is the kind of place the Austin Powers would find a perfect place in which to ""shag."""
1,One of the worse movies ever made...,"I wondered if the director did any research on Jean Harlow's life before making this movie. There was a lot of important details that were left out. She did not die of pnemonia, her mother was a freak who didn't believe in doctors and there was no mention of William Powell, her fiance at the time of her death. Do not rent this film! Rent of one her actual movies! She was a true movie star!"
3,Fictional 60s Harlow,"This glossy 1965 film has Carroll Baker playing Jean Harlow, although the story is more fiction than fact. Parts of the story are taken from Jean Harlow's life but most of the time it seems to be about some entirely fictional version of Harlow. And Carroll Baker, although she does a decent job, doesn't quite have the ""star quality"" to convince us she (as Harlow) is a big movie star and ""love goddess"". And the film feels very anachronistic; except for the cars everything looks more 1960s than 1930s.As a Harlow biopic, this is worthless, and the story is full of clichés, but as entertainment, it works pretty well in a campy way if you don't take it seriously at all. It's trash, but entertaining trash. Recommended for fans of 1960s kitsch and fans of movies about Hollywood. 3+"
2,"It has its moments, but...","...this is a movie based on a ficticious biography by one of Harlow's first agents and thus, an inaccurate depiction of Jean's life. If you want the real story on Jean Harlow , I suggest you find two recent biographies written about Harlow within the last 5-6 years; They dispell all the myths and get to the truth. A movie was to be made in 2000 based on one of these books, but it hasn't happened yet. So, in the meantime, enjoy this 1960's escapism movie for the outlandish sets, great wardrobe and lots of soap opera drama...but, don't take it seriously because of its inaccuracy. But I will say Carroll Baker, Peter Lawford, and Angela Lansbury do the best they can with what was given them."
3,A Slice of the 60's,"Even though this film is supposed to take place in the 30's, it's B-Movie 60's film flash all the way - a Hollywood extravagant self-indulgent look in the mirror at the old studio ""star machine"" complete with a pale blonde virginal starlet, great looking glitzy gowns, sexual innuendo for the times and a bachelor pad (Leslie Nielsen's)that Austin Powers would covet. It's not trying to paint an accurate picture of Jean Harlow at all. Once you get over that fact, it's pure fun to watch and enjoy."
3,Classic Hollywood film!,"Who else but Catol Baker could portray the legendary Sex Goddess!Her figure, her clothes, makeup; THATS HOLLYWOOD!Baker comes across breathlessly in Harlow's form, and I don't believe anyone else could have done it better.She truly captures your heart in the final scene where she lay dying and reaching out to her mama in her final breath. The movie Harlow will be forevermore listed as a legendary classic.The Carol Baker's of yesteryear are gone now and it's sad that they are not given the recognition they so deserve. What is left now? Only actors who forget their lines and are truly miscast in many roles. A lover of Classic films in Calif."
2,Very disapointing,"I already have all these songs, and I was looking foward to cd quality versions of songs that I only have on vinyl. I was exremely disapointed to find out that they censored Pipebomb on Landsdowne Street. What a rip off!!!! The unsencored version's hillarious and was meant as a joke, but the band pussied out and censored it probably cause they thought that they'd offend some people. Man this band used to be cool, now they're just a bunch of pussies. I recomend you hunt down the AF split and listen to the uncensored version of the song."
4,Great strap,"I like this strap and it's flexibility. I use it on my canon t3i and t4i and it works well. I wanted a strap that was easily detachable. My father has one and has loved it. I also enjoy the memory card wallet on the strap. With this, you won't need to go in and out of your bag when you burn through a memory card."
2,"Nice strap, but attachment to camera gets in the way","The idea of a detachable strap is great, but in LowePro's Transporter design, the quick release and buckles on the camera attachment are too big, stiff and bulky, even for a pro camera body. They were always in the way of the controls and the LCD on the camer. They also impaired holding the camera -- I was fighting the dongles all the time. It was a relief to get this thing off the camera. It's OK as a secondary strap for a large lens or a medium camera case, where is is not on the camera itself.The detachable memory card carrier is a throw-away; there are better places to stow a card, where you don't have to rip your way through a rat nest of Velcro to get to it. The slip-resistant silkscreen pattern on the shoulder pad is rather ineffective -- needs to be tackier. In sum: a good concept, poor execution; needs a serious rework."
4,Nice strap,"I feel this strap is well made with one exception: The side release buckles induces a fear of inadvertently opening. This is easily solved by using the twist ties that come with the packaging to secure the buckles. This at least affords a little peace of mind. Otherwise it is nicely made, looks good, is very strong (except at the release buckles) and is quite comfortable. It seems to me to be a good value. I am happy with it so far."
4,Nice strap,"I am a big guy, the strap could stand to be longer. It is very well thought out aside from that. Double ""stays"" on each end so it is not likely to come un-done accidentally. The storage for extra memory cards is great. Stitching is tight and good quality heavy thread. It also has quick release clips on each end. I especially like this when using my tripod - no straps blowing into the photo. All-in-all very nice."
3,Decent strap,This strap is a good quality decent camera strap. It could used more padding on the neck and the clips could be coated to prevent scratching
3,good strap / OK release mechanism,"The camera strap is perfect. good length, easily adjustable, doesn't slip easily.The quick release mechanism, however, is not ideal. It is a little too easy to release. Since I now know how easy it is to break free, I am very careful not to touch one side of the release, then the other."
2,Critical flaw,"The quick releases, well... they quick release. Intentionally trying to get them to disengage, I managed to get a release 2 out of 5 times by trapping the catches between my arm and chest. Admittedly it was intentional but still. It is a comfortable strap however, so I zip-tied the releases and will use it until I find something better."
3,David's review,The snap connectors on this strap are very light weight and do not seem to be very secure. If either one of them were do be bumped I think they could release easilly and the camera could crash to the ground.
2,Not long enough,Overall I'd say not worth the money. I'm still looking for a better after market strap for my D200. This one is too short to wear across the body if you're tall like I am.
3,Bulky,"although this product seems like it is very well designed, in actual fact, it is very bulky once it is fitted onto the camera. ended up using the original camera strap that came with the camera. don't get this"
3,"I don't love it, but it works","Why I wanted it:I didn't like the huge Nikon logo around my neck, I felt like it drew too much attention to me when I'm shooting in public places. I just wanted a generic strap for my camera.Impression after buying it:It's generic enough, yes. It's more comfortable than the one that came with my D80. I'm not thrilled about the buckles for quick release. A safety lock would have definitely made me feel a little more at ease with that. I only use one camera, but I guess if you use more than one and have to switch quickly, then it may be useful. I don't use the memory card wallet but it's alright and can be taken off easily (velcro).All in all, it does the job, but I'm not CRAZY about it."
1,"Major Design Problem, Be Aware!!!","This camera strap has a major design problem: there's no security lock for the side release buckles. The side release buckles are designed to allow quick interchangeability with other camera using the same strap. However, the two buckles are too easily releasable and there's no security lock to keep the strap and the camera from seperation. I have used the strap for a week, and one of the buckle got released by itself twice. I had only one camera. Luckily, I didn't drop my camera but I would never use this strap again."
2,Redesign would help,"While I am a big fan of LowePro quality, I was rather disappointed when I learned that the ""quick release"" clasps give way with the smallest amount of pressure. The strap is great but I currently have yarn connecting the two pieces of the quick release buckle so that it doesn't accidentally open and drop thousands of dollars worth of equipment. A different quick release (maybe like Kata's bullclip style) would be much more secure for regular use and still just as interchangeable. I don't recommend purchasing this product unless you have a plan for working around the quick release buckle."
4,"Nice sturdy strap, with slight disadvantages..","Okay, first the pros:SturdyShoulder pad has a ""tack"" to prevent slipping off shoulderSoft feel around neck (not stiff)media pouch for SD cardsquick disconnect latcheslonger than standard strap that my camera shipped with (nice since I am tall)Now the cons:rings instead of cloth ends attach to camera, over time wear off finish?quick disconnect latches, not enough strength, too easy to disconnectI would buy this strap over again, if I had the chance. It's solid, great craftmanship, media pouch is great, and disconnect problem is easily remedied by tossing a couple tip ties in the loops. You are defeating the purpose of the quick disconnect, but if you are weary of dropping your expensive equipment, this might give you piece of mind."
3,Lowepro Strap for DSLR,"This strap is much better than the one that came with my pentax DSLR camera as it is longer, more comfortable and has great adjustability. What I did not like about is the quick release mechanism and the stiffness of the strap at the binding posts of the camera. The quick release makes me nervous about accidentally dropping the camera. The stiff material used on the strap that attaches to the posts on the camera makes it akward to move the camera around. It causes the strap to get in the way of you being able to get your eye in the viewfinder and to place it back in your case."
2,The ring broke after 2 months usage,"I am disappointed with the product. I use it on Canon 40D for 1 month, around 3-4 times a week and one of the ring broke (the one that connected to the camera).The straps has little pockets that store 2 extra Compact Flash cards,when I am in shooting in portrait orientation, this container often annoy me by blocking my view.The shoulder strap is fine and better than Canon strap that I get."
4,Strap,The strap came free with the purchase of the camera and I put it on when I got the camera. It has a pouch for an extra CF card. Nice.
2,only a little better to OEM strap.,"I'm a professional photographer, need a better strap for two camera shot. This one is only a little better than the strap that came with my Nikon D700. It a bit shorter than most. I completely agree with other post about the quick release function. Very cheap plastic, easy to accidental release. I attached a Velcro strip to it, therefore preventing a accidental release. If you looking for a strap that will not slip during an active shoot, I would probably look for a better option. If you just want a replace to your factory strap, than it about the same. The paddle on the shoulder then to slide around, so you'll constantly readjusting it. Kind of a pain.If your a pro or semi-pro who then to have one or more cameras, best to skip this one."
2,Adjustment Buckles Get In The Way,"Take a look at the photo of this strap. See the adjustment ""buckles"" at each end of the strap?These guys really get in your way. They don't allow the strap to twist and thus they bind when you're moving the camera for a vertical shot.Very annoying."
2,original down to the bone group,"Without any prejudice whatsoever, the original group who made the CD ""From Manhattan to Staten"" was a far better group in terms of a better rendition, because they were more natural with the African illulations and the drum beats along with organs, trumpets, saxaphones,tom tom,vocals, etc. My humble suggestion is that the original group should be regrouped taking a lead from the the first three(3) CD'S which were made, including ""FROM MANHATTAN TO STATEN"".If this is done I can assure you by GOD'S will that the CD'S will be a sellout."
3,Solid grooves with mixed results...,"When I first heard ""From Manhattan to Staten"" I thought that Down to the Bone had a lot of potential but after listening to this ""Best Of"" CD it's obvious that their potential is limited.Yes they have a few infectious hooks and the groove is steady but it becomes rather lethargic after a while.CD highlights...The ZodiacStaten Island GrooveBrooklyn Heights"
4,Best of down to the bone,"It's quite a good mix, they did pick most of my favorites. I Use it while exercising, keeps me movin'"
4,one of the last great combos,turn it up and it will blow your mind i had not heard them for a long time yor qick playback made me know what i had missed
5,Outstanding,"This book was totally awesome. It deals with magic, but it also has a fair amount of realness and fun to it too. The story twists through plots and the totally unexpected happens, keeping a reader on the edge of their seat. The exciting adventures are all origional and fun to read, with a drop of romance mixed into the plots. The Realms of the Gods is a really fun book to read."
5,The best way to end (or is it begin?) Daine's adventures,"I find all of Tamora Pierce's books to be exciting, but this is one of her best. She has strong female role models who go on adventures that many people long to go on in this time without sorcery and superstition. Superb writing, Ms. Pierce! (and this from a high school student!)"
5,Best of the Immortals series. Magic! Adventure! romance!,"The Realms of the Gods starts off beautifully, and goes straight to the page-turning stuff. The heroine, Daine, is strong, funny, and beleivible as a person. Every chapter holds exciting events like attacks from immortal creatures, and meetings with dragons. When I finished this book, I still refused to put it down. I thank Tamora for writing this extraordinary book, and I can't wait to read more of her books :)"
4,"Nice book, but I was expecting more","The Realms of the Gods is a pretty good book, with many of the elements that made me read her whole Immortals series. I guess I was expecting an incredible, character-changing ending to the series. That's not what you'll find here. The plot, with Daine and Numair wandering around the Divine Realms most of the time, doesn't seem quite as focused as in her other novels, and the ending made me want to throw the book against the wall and scream,""That's it?"""
1,This Book.......................,"This book could have been better, I mean she didn't explain what happened between Numaire and Daine after that encounter. I mean she didn't explain anything. I wish she would write a fifth book to clarify things. I respect her as a great author and her books are my my favorite but she needs to write a fifth book.This is my review."
1,This book is definatly the pits!!!!!!,Come on peoples! Lets get realistic here. HE HAS WHITE HAIRS!!They are 14 years apart!! I think that Daine has mental problems. She is off her rocker. She doesn't have a full deck of cards. Numair has the exact same problems
1,Realm of the Gods,"This went over the top in a confusing and disjointed way. I felt like Tamora had just been to see ""Alien"" or some such and said, ""Cool, I'll throw some of that in my book."" There were all sorts of amazing and horrible things that were about to consume the world, and then they just went away with a little godly interference or the right spell that someone happened to know. It seemed that Tamora was trying to get the visuals as fantastic as possible without worrying too much about weaving a good, tight story. The first three books were worth reading, but this was a let down. I felt the Alanna series was much better overall."
1,second review,"I earlier wrote a review saying this book was 40% junk. I have changed my mind. I believe that this book rates 100% junk now. It is simplistic, disgusting, rather boring except for Leaf, predictable and a clear sign that Tamora Pierce is running out of creative ideas. Predictable, predictable. We are introduced to so many new things added to spice up the plot that it numbs the mind. Instead, most turn to the ""blossoming romance"" between Denominatior and Numerator. ALL YOU TAMORA PIERCE WORSHIPPERS GET REAL!! LIFE IS NOT HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!! Read the Toguh guide to fantasyland, and Terry Brooks reviews andyou will know what I think of romance worship."
5,The best of the series,"I really think that this was the best conclusion that somebody could ask for. I mean it left a little to be desired but that just makes you want to read her next series about tortall. It had everything- romance, humor, adventure, etc. I really thought that this was wonderful on the part of Tamora Pierce- this lives up to the standards set by the Lioness quartet. GREAT JOB MS. PIERCE"
4,Not Tamora Pirce's Best,"The book was pretty good, but cannot compare w/the first Alanna book. Also, i don't think Numair and Dianeshould get together -- i mean, Alanna married someone so much OLDER than her, and now Diane does the same! Goerge is already grown up when Alanna is a page, and Numair is a mage when Diane is about 13! I think its ridiculous!"
2,Um... think Mary K. Laterno,"I thought that this book was unncessary, as it answered the questions that we already knew the answer to. All that it accomplished was to get Numair and Daine together, a couple I didn't agree with anyway. Imagine how YOU would feel if your author married you to an uncle-figure. Think Mary K. Laterno. In my opinion, she should have married someone ELSE (ANYONE else). Evan or Kaddar are examples of more eligible bachelors. No plot. No character development. Meeting Weirin was a sort of let down, since nothing really happened. Characters were rather static throughout the book, especially compared to her other books. I did, however, really enjoy the dragons. As far as I'm concerned, this book was unncessary. It could have ended more satifactorily with Emperor Mage. No hate-mail, please."
3,Charmingly predictable...,"...and as I wrote regarding the Trickster series that is just fine. Plot twists are clearly telegraphed, bad guys are quite bad. Good guys are very good. There is one exception to this trend in this series that I thought was a nice touch. The Immortals series gets off to a rocky start. The first volume has a bit of excessive exposition aimed at younger readers and when handled well that is fine, but in this case it is a bit ham-fisted in places.As other readers have noted the country bumpkin routine gets somewhat tiresome in the first volume, but things pick up and accelerate through the series. This seems to be par for the course for Ms. Pierce. Usually books in a series tend to go downhill as they progress, but that is not the case here.For adult readers these are bite sized morsels. I was able to plow through the third volume in an evening. For younger readers I suspect these are paced about right.I do wish these ""quartets"" came in one or two volumes."
4,I loved it (is more detail needed. . .),"I loved this book, even the 50th time, and it rather irks me that people seem to be paying little attention to the details they are slamming. Yes, I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but Numair is 30, not 60, and it is very common for people in stressful situations (such as being attacked by immortals on a regular basis) to have some white hair. Heck, my brother hasn't had any such stressful situations as far as I know and he has some white hair. The whole plot was, to say the least, origonal. It was nice to find an author that did not use the same ideas as every other author with books in print. I'm looking forward to finding out what happens to Daine and Numair in the new Tortall series."
5,On behalf of all us hypnotised readers...,"To Ms. Pierce, from a reader who has read almost every one of your books (I still haven't been able to get my hands on the second Song of the Lioness book), I'd just like to say this: HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO US! There is no thing more cruel in the world, than to end not a book, but a SERIES, just after someone proposes. We don't even know if Daine said yes or not! Although, the chemistry between Daine and Numair really was evident (especially in Emperor Mage), and I'm surprised that there were actually people who were surprised when they got together. Come on! How do you not see it? And I don't care what anybody else says. This book was wonderful (even though it left us hanging), and I'm always right, so don't even try to argue."
5,Tamora is the author I've been looking for!,"I was taken away by the first Pierce book I read (The Lioness Quartet) and I thought that I could never find a book that could top it. Boy was I wrong. The Immortals series brings you into the book and into the story. It has that kind of magic that makes you feel every emotion that they feel. You get to know the characters like if you yourself knew them personaly. This is true for all of Tamora's books. I hope you take my advice and at least read The Immortals series and I promise you that you like, if not love it."
1,The veil between Plot and Chaos has dissolved!,"I enjoyed the other books in this series, but I don't think I can finish this one. I'm not finding any coherent narrative at all. So far, the idea of this book is that random Horrible Things are popping out of the Otherworld, various crazy Gods are doing weird things, and Daine is having a cozy visit with her dead Ma. Plotwise, it's not going anywhere.To my mind, the author had something good going with Daine's bond with animals. She should have stuck with that. In general, the more you involve 'Gods' in a plot, the less 'believable' it is. And therefore, you just don't care!I wish Pierce had wrapped it all up with the last book. That one had a good strong storyline, great animal characters, and a whompin' great climax about to happen... and voila, it's like the editors told her not to kill the bad guys but stretch it all out for another book."
3,40% junk. Who could read this?,"10% junk is the way that the romance is described. This book isn't for 9-year olds. 20% of the junk is how ordinary, how powerless the gods seem in their home. The badger loses his mystery. Weiryn is boring. 5% junk: the book is simplistic. Numair has OTHER girlfriends, people! So about them falling in love. I didn't mind that much. 5%of the junk. Uusoae looks like she's been thrown in for some spice into the plot. WELL THE BOOK 'S STILL BAD!!!but you can read it if you are a giant Pierce fan. .5% junk is the ending. I felt unsatisfied."
5,I love it!,"I am 12 years old and am a Tamora Pierce nut! I love all she writes, and would recomend Alanna and her next book <can't remember name> Thanks for reading this! Pam"
1,Poor book in a series that started well.,"I have read all the books in this series, and really enjoyed the first two, but Realms of the Gods is just poor, it lacks something that made the others so enjoyable. It answers a few questions that needed answering, but don't expect much from it. It doesn't live up to the other books by Tamora Pierce."
4,"Good, but not at the top","I read Wild magic and loved it! I read Wolf speaker and Emperor mage and they were great! Then I read Realms of the gods. It was ok, but the ending didn't really tell what ended up happening and Daine's father was a bit disapointing. But otherwise, it's fine."
5,An Absolute Must-Read!,"I have one thing to say and one thing only. Everyone who is whining and acting like Daine just hooked up with her grandfather......SHUT UP! If it's that big a deal to you, you should have stopped reading after the first book because it was SO obvious that they liked each other, even then. 14 years difference is not that big a deal. Take the classic Jane Eyre for an example...Mr. Rochester and Jane were 22 years apart and no one made a big fuss over that. Oh, and one more thing, to the ridiculous parents who go on about sexual content,GIVE ME A BREAK! I've read more sexual things in a science book! You'd be surprised how much kids already know by the time they're 8."
4,I LUV IT!,"It's such a great book! Coming from me, that's probably a lot since i've read my share of dumb books, but this! It's a work of art, i tell u. Daine rocks! But...um...Does anyone know how you pronounce her name? I'm not sure....Oh well. Anyway, i'm just crossing my fingers that Ms. Pierce would write just one more book about Daine and her friends. I would love to find out if Daine and Numair got married and all that."
1,This book really wansn't as good as the rest of the series.,"In this last book Daine and Numair are taken to the realms of the gods. But they felt that they had to go home to fight a war going on in their own realm, so they set out for the land of the dragons. It seemed like they had no trouble getting there and everything worked out perfectly. Also Daine and Numair fell in love which really discusted me. Through out all of the other books they had a father daughter relationship. The author tried to turn it into a love story and it didn't work. I am a very big fan of the rest of Tamora Pierce's books but this one wasn't what I expected."
2,Not for my kids,"As a lover of fantasy, I found a lot to enjoy about this book. As a parent, I was troubled that a book clearly marketed to kids has its 16-year-old heroine falling in love with, kissing, and discussing both sex and marriage with a 30-year-old man. How many parents of teen girls want our daughters' imaginations caught up in this kind of scenario? There are a lot of other great fantasy books to choose from. This one doesn't belong in our home."
2,"Realms of the Gods,","This is the most recent in the Immortals Series. It seems more outrageous than the other books, and I wasn't even able to finish it.Poorly written and executed plot"
3,it wasn't as exciting as the others in this series,All of a sudden it arubtly ended. that was that. it didn't leave the reader anything left to ponder.
3,"A bit disappointing, I am sorry to say.","I have been a great fan of Ms. Pierce for many years, and still reread many of her books, but this last book to The Immortals has been disappointing to me; too many events ended so coincidentally that it made the characters seem not as strong as they were in the books before. Tamora Pierce inspired me to write at a young age, but the way that The Realm of the Gods was put together made it seem as if it was written in a hurry and with less thought (it was my impression that she wanted to get the series over with). I'm sorry to say I enjoyed her other books much more than this one, even though it provides answers to questions given in previous books to the series."
5,Great!,"I'll start with the good things. A. This was definitely one of the best in the series, and I loved all the stuff about the gods etc. B. The whole book was great. C. READ IT! Okay now the bad things. I didn't like Daine and Numair's love affair. All this time he's been like a father or a mentor to her, or maybe an older cuzzin. You know, one of the people we would call a ""family"" friend or a relative. Did meeting Weiryn change their relationship? Well I think he's too old for her (not to be a prude or anything) and that she should either not marry him or waitttttttt a few years before she even thinks about love. If you overlook the love parts, THIS IS A WORK OF ART and a MUST READ! If you want to skim the love parts... let's just say you arent alone."
3,"Loved bits, hated other bits","This was the weakest in the series. The great part was about Daine and Numair. They were just so adorable! The bad bits were the almost hurried, disorganised storylines thrown in for good measure. It's almost as if Ms Pierce ran out of steam. I would LOVE to know what happens with Numair and Daine. Hopefully there will be more stories about this great land and these great people."
3,Not one of Tamora's best,"I think Tamora Pierce has already done better. ""The Realms Of The Gods"" DO give the answers we've been waiting for so long. But Daine is walking in the Realms of the Gods now. This makes the Gods much less exeptional and the Realms almost commonplace. What's become of the rare occasions when Alanna communicated with a Goddess"
4,I liked this book alot!,"I liked this book alot, first of all because I have been looking for it in paperback for the past, what, four months, I guess! I thing it's great for fantasy lovers. Tamora Pierce is a definite favorite author of mine, and this is one of her great works. I like the main character, Daine, and the badduns are pretty realistic, compared to other dumb fantasy books. They really should try to make a movie for at least one of Tammy's books, but it won't turn out 1/4 as good as any of them. I liked the Emperor Mage and The Price of Immortality. I think it's my favoriteYou Should Read The Emperor Mage and definatly The Price Of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock"
5,To the kids that reviewed this after I did.,"To Athens, you've gotta be kidding me when you talk about her abandoning her 'special moments between characters'. You have to be, 'cause there's at least one, maybe more. To Tessa Lee, I *almost* cried during the book. I just cried today when I was reading it, during that unexpected, bizarre part.PS What I mean by the bizarre part is where there's a serious lack of them understanding each other. Y'know, the part where he's yelling at her."
4,Excellent,"Well, I am a really huge fan of this series, as are the others who have taken the time to write in here. This has to be my favourite series. It has everything- fantasy creatures, a girl that is about my age, the ability to talk to and change into any animal, the wonderful locations, characters and the cute lover, well, at least in my mind. :)Read these books if you want a good read, but be warned, as others have pointed out, I too found myself crying the first time I finished the series, that is why I gave 4 stars. And especially what happens to a close friend of Daine's, it is emotional, and very well-written, but I say no more..."
5,This book is the best book you could ever hope to read!,"Tamora Pierce did an amazing job with this book! Although I loved all her other books too, the Immortals' Series has to be the best in my opinion. I love the way Daine and Numair fall in love, but I think that Ms. Pierce should have written more on the turn out of their relationship. Daine and Numair's adventures in the Realm of the Gods are fun and exciting! I felt as if I was pulled into the book and taken along with them to fight the Carthakians and Ozorne. I know that you will love this series and most of all this book. Any person that has read her books will surely know that this book is the best!"
5,How can you NOT totally love this book?,"When I started reading the Immortals Series, I thought WILD MAGIC was the best it could be. As I continued read the other books in the series, I marvled at the same greatness and perfection. Then I read REALMS OF THE GODS and it totally blew me away. It will take your breatth away. Daine and Numair get stuck in the mysterious realms of the gods. They must make the perilous journey to get back to Tortall, where a desparate war is taking place and the duo is needed if there is any hope of winning. Things aren't as easy as it might sound... Look- please trust me-- these books are all that and a bag of chips! Tamora Pierce is not some JV author. In order to really read, you have to read her stuff. Take my word on it."
5,Gimmie more! Gimmie more! Gimmie more!,"I LOVED THAT BOOK! I thought that it was the best book in the whole series, and I was depressed to see it end. (Really. I went through a whole bag of chips getting over it!) It was about time Numair and Daine got together. I sort of saw it comming, but it's amazing how great wizards and scholars (NUMAIR! ) can't see what's in front of their noses untill it knocks them one in the face. Or untill they almost loose that person. I liked the dragons, too. They're just how I think dragons are: almost human, but a whole lot smarter. There was a lot of blood and guts in some parts, and the descriptions of Uusao made my skin crawl. And you get to meet Daines mom and dad, who you only hear about throught the rest of the series. All in all, that book was brilliant. ^_^"
5,I Love It!,"When I read the first book that Tamore Pierce wrote about Diane, I couldn't put it down. The second and third books were also intrguing, leaving me with a serious longing for the last book. This book four was the greatest book in the series. Tamora Pierce managed to wrap up the series and create a romance between the two main character, Daine and Numair, all in one! I love the way Diane thinks and speaks like a real person, not some magic increased wierdo. I just love the way everything turned out, and I can guarentee Diane Lovers will also enjoy the last book in this series."
4,Incredible Style,"I haven't heard the CD so I do not wish to give it five stars. But I must say the track, ""How It Goes"" is chilled to the max.Intelligent DnB.. it's like abstract hip hop (you can almost say trip-hop) taking a culture course. Great stuff from what I've heard, I will check out more."
5,great cd totally worth it dont listen to anyone but me.,"this cd was great, from a producer and dj's eyes this cd is one of the best i have ever heard in drum and bass with a little break beat mixed in. give it a chance you might like it. i bought this cd at borders so i had nothing to lose but the reciept. and im glad i took that chance."
2,don't buy,"Only a few tracks on this cd are worth listening to, and even they don't break any new ground. I think I owned this for about a week before i sold it back."
5,cappella fan,"I have been a cappella fan for years and this is my 3rd cappella album ever and i can see its gonna be brilliant, it has my favourite track ""u got 2 let the music"" so i am happy that i will be buying ""cappella remixes"""
3,Average Shoulder Rest,The rubber on these does wear out quicker than other shoulder rests I've had and they do fall off more than I feel they should.
4,Student Grade...,"This was the first shoulder rest I had. No matter the amount of adjusting, I couldn't get that ""perfect fit."" It never fell off while playing, but would frequently wiggle off when the violin wasn't to my shoulder. The width of the padding was a little narrow for my liking and on occasion would dig into my shoulder. Overall though, it wasn't a bad shoulder rest and was generally comfortable. If you have the money, I'd suggest going for the Wolf Forte Primo 3/4 - 4/4 Violin Shoulder Rest instead. However, if the Kun rest has fallen into your hands, fear not."
4,It was recommended and it fit,I am happy with the shoulder rest. It was recommended by my instructor and I couldn't be happier with it.
3,Found a better one for very thin people,"Fits well if you have chest muscles covering your rib cage, but I was endlessly frustrated that I could not modify this to fit my very skinny son's body. We tried longer screws to raise the lower end of the rest in an effort to prevent the violin from sitting vertically against his small frame. Longer screws did not work because ultimately it extended the lower foot of the violin rest into a position angled far from where it needed to be. I found a FOM rest (ME 051?) that allows for unlimited rotation of both feet and a much greater amount of extension and retraction of each foot than the 3-5 screw holes offered on the KUN rests. The foot height can also be extended in a similar way to what I had done on the KUN - just take it to a hardware store to get the appropriate diameter and thread pitch extension bolt and a threaded female-female connector or smooth teflon connector that you can thread onto the two bolts to connect and extend their height."
5,needed for any violin player,My daughter had the all in one kit that came with a piece of phone. This product is needed and provide my daughter hours of comfort. She found it easy to install and uses it all the time. Also replacement parts are easy to come by. My daughter lost one of the nuts that allows it to adjust. .69 part was available and easy to find. The padding it very flexible.
3,Not the old Kun,"I lost a screw from my shoulder rest therefore, I needed one. This one was not as sturdy as the older kun that I have. I find it has the tendency to move from the placed position slightly. Over all I find it to be ok, especially for practicing."
4,Does its job,"I had a shoulder rest for my 3/4 violin when I started out, but once I upgraded to a full-size, I never got around to buying a rest. After eight years away, I've picked up my violin again and decided to finally get a shoulder rest. I like this one; it's quite comfortable, but I wish I had noted whether or not it was collapsable. Since it's not, it doesn't fit in my case very well, if at all. I suppose for extended periods of time, I could unscrew the feet completely, but from day-to-day, I just set it aside when I put my violin away."
3,"Careful, it's not collapsible","I've been using a collapsible Kun shoulder rest for years, and finally wore my old one out. I intended to replace it with the exact same item, but did not realize this one does not collapse. So now I have to return this one and get one that will fit in my violin case. Other than that, the product worked fine."
1,bummer never feceived,"We purchased this item and and additinal item an extra set of violin strings, the strings were reecived but we have never received the shoulder pad, because of the small dollar amount paid we have not bothered to complain, We however have stopped shopping on this site and returned to EBAY for our shopping. we have been very pleased with our expierence with EBay and overstock and would recommend those sites for shopping never having had a bad expierence."
3,"These are okay, but nothing special",These treats are okay and my dog will eat them. They seem rather hard and it's not a treat he will eat right away. It's more of a save for later type of treat.
5,Great!,Arrived faster then expected and are much cheaper to purchase here then at the pet store....I LOVE YOU GUYS....
2,I didn,I didn't get what picture and ingredients showed. So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog's treats. They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change. So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed. I may buy them again. I don't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good. My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them. review from 2 stars to 5 stars.
5,GREAT FOR SATURN S-SERIES!,"Great for a somewhat stiffer than stock improvement in handling--don't wait till you have 300,000 miles on your Saturn like I did. These Struts rock. Keep that Saturn going! The KYB 234056 and KYB 234055 GR-2 Struts work together on the S-Series. Enjoy!"
1,No delay start as advertised,This item advertises that it has a delay start. It does not and we still had to buy a delay start attachment which plugs into the wall.
2,"Blah, more of a teaser than a guide.","This Guide is about all it does. Get's you through the basics. To bad they didn't let VersusBooks do this one. Their treatment of Baldur's Gate II & the Expansion was perfect (except for the printing errors, which they graciously correctly and provide a replacement at no charge for those of us with an early edition) All the really good stuff you buy a guide for is completely left out (What the loot is where to get it) and although you don't always want to use them. The inclusion of the cheats codes is a nice bonus VersusBooks gives us for BG:II but prima LEAVES OUT for ID:II. But since this is all there is I guess you have to buy it. I hope Bioware and BlackIsle will use Versus in the future as prima's guides are weak."
3,"Good Walkthrough, but that's all","The consists mainly of a walkthrough. The do have maps and nice little helpful hint boxes. That portion of the book is done well and I have no complaints there, but what I can't understand is not having a list of items or breaking down the spells by class and by level (something sorely needed in the manual). If you just want a walkthrough, then this guide will serve, but if you want a complete guide, you will be disappointed."
1,Crazy-making!,"This book drives me crazy! The buttons will not stay untangled. No matter how many times I try to untangle them, the minute my son opens this book the ribbons get knotted into an intricate rope of ribbons and buttons! If I do not untagle them, the book is rendered useless. Given hindsight I would not re-purchase this book."
4,Keep this book up on a shelf!,"This book is adorable. I love the concept. But, like a few others have mentioned - the button ribbons are CONSTANTLY tangled up. My seven year old daughter even braided them once. If you decide to get this book I would recommend keeping it out of little hands reach and only taking it out for an adult/child story time. It is a super cute, colorful and fun book and my three year old loves reading it with me."
2,A mom with two toddlers,"I bought this book for my 16 month old and my 3 year old to play with together. It looked like it would be just right for this age group because the book is sturdy and very colorful and the buttons are big enough for little fingers to hold on to easily. However, even though they both like to read the book and put the buttons on the pages, it becomes frustrating for everyone because the ribbons become tangled so easily. I even followed the recommendation from the publisher about braiding and tying the strings together and that did not work very well either. It takes me approximately15 to 20 minutes to untangle the ribbons before my daughters can read through this book once. I would not recommend this book--there are too many other great books out there that don't cause the frustration that this one does!"
3,"Frustrating for parents, fun for toddlers","I purchased this book for my 15 month old daughter. The illustrations are wonderful to look at, very colorful and witty in design. Each page has a simple rhyme, and an accompaning picture with a round cut out for your child to place big round buttons. It's sequential, one through ten, and the buttons must be removed from from one page to next. This was the frustrating part! The ribbons got tangled very easily, even when braided, and it isn't easy to untangle them. Futher, braiding shortened some of the ribbons which makes for some tight fits on pages where the slots are all over the page. I don't know if my solution will work for others, but I cut the buttons off the ribbons and only allow my daughter to play with this book with close supervision. Fortunatly for me, she past the 'put everything in your mouth' phase so this solution works in our case. She has a lot more fun this way, can remove the buttons herself, and I don't feel so inept!"
2,Great Concept --- but AWFUL execution!,"This book looked like it would really keep my 2-1/2 yr old entertained- especially on car rides. It's a nice solid book with large buttons securely fastened to long colorful ribbons. The first page starts with a brightly colored picture and an indentation to place one button. Each page adds another place for a button - all the way up to page 10 which has a place for all 10 buttons.The saleswoman where I bought it cautioned me that the buttons get tangled, but I didn't think it would be a big deal and bought it anyway. I was so WRONG! Within minutes the ribbons are all wrapped around eachother and the buttons no longer reach where they're supposed to. If you don't mind spending hours untangling cords (or if you have a child who loves to untangle ribbons, yarn, long strings, etc.), then this is a terrific book. But for me, the point of the book was to keep my child occupied without my intervention...and for that purpose, this book failed miserably!"
2,So Frustrating!,"The concept of this book is wonderful, the words and pictures fabulous. But the buttons will not stay untangled and they are frustrating to me, a 34-year-old woman...my two year old doesn't even try anymore. I do keep this book up out of his reach, but even when I read it the ribbons tangle up. I would never buy this book again."
3,It will keep you preoccupied. Not sure about your toddler.,"I bought this book because my daughter loves buttons. I figured it would be a great book to keep her entertained at church or when I need to make dinner. What I didn't figure was how it would keep me preoccupied. Like the other readers, I do spend a great deal of my time untangling the darn buttons. I can deal with this as my daughter is sort of patient and tries to untangle them too.What drives me and my daughter absolutely bonkers is how the buttons don't fit into the button holes.My daughter and I will spend a good deal of time trying to make them fit and stay in the button holes so she can count them but they simply don't fit.So now she spends more time going through the book and pulling out the buttons I squish in between pages and untangles them then actually fitting them into the corresponding holes."
2,the tangle book,"This book looks so appealing for kids who like manipulating little things and strings. I was definitely drawn in by the strings and colors. This book quickly becomes a book connected to a big tangle of strings and buttons. I actually kind of enjoy untangling them occassionally while I watch TV, but I do this maybe twice a year. The rest of the time the tangle of strings and buttons is a handle for my 15 month old twins to haul the book around by. There are many better activity books out there."
4,"Very disappointing, A waste of money","The ribbons in this book get tangled too easily and too often. I have read the others' reviews and see that some mentioned instructions for braiding on the inside cover. I must have an older version because nowhere in my book are there any instructions for keeping the ribbons untangled. I am now past the point of untangling them for the gezillionth time to braid them. I am throwing it away and considering the money I spent on this book a waste. The book may be fun and have educational merit, but only if my children are able to use this book - which they can't because of the constant mess the ribbons are in."
4,From an Allergy Sufferor,"I bought the XJ-2000 because I have moderately bad allergies. I live in grass pollen country, and this year was particularly bad. I bought the XJ-2000 hoping that it would provide me some relief, and I must say that it has done that. Pollen counts are lower, but still high, and I haven't had any problems sleeping due to wheezing and other upper respiratory problems. I do keep it on the low setting since the high setting produces more of a swimming pool smell. My one gripe is that after about 2 weeks, the units became noticably louder. It was whisper quite at first, and now it makes a sort of white noise hiss. It doesn't interupt my sleep, but it is noticable. Where I live it is very quiet though, outside night time noise level is about 30 dBA. So the hiss that the units makes may not be noticable to someone who lives in a louder acoustic environment. I haven't tried the ionic breeze, but for a old cheepo like me the XJ-2000 does just fine."
1,Don't Do It!,"If you are looking at this DVD because you are looking to rekindle the memory of the jammin', eighty-riffic, rocking Dokken, this DVD is not what you are looking for!All of the songs are re-arranged into what basically sounds like Dokken lounge music. For guitar players, what little you see and hear of George Lynch is awesome, but there is not enough to satisfy. Also, the other guys singing the material reminded me of Bill Murray singing the theme from Star Wars. Overall the sound quality is great, the interviews are pointless and boring, and the performance is lackluster. Thumbs Down!"
4,Dokken at their Best,"Awesome footage of the re-united, original members of DOKKEN doin their hits acousticly....the tracks on this DVD sounds good..only compliant is, I feel it was too short. Highlight of the disk is they cover the Beatles Nowhere Man, and show us, even more with this track, how awesome the ORIGINAL BAND can harmonize vocally... The interview footage isn't that good in qualty and feel we could do without some of the footage; like seeing George Lynch at the beach..Who cares? I want the music!! This was Dokken at their Best..Recently seen Dokken at a club minus original guitarist and bass player and was not impressed..With Dokken, Only the original line up will do...So, if you wanna see the best of Dokken in rare acoustic format, pick this one up...It gets a 4 because it was too short, the interview footage wasn't that great and no real exciting extras were included..other than that, it's very good and kool to watch"
4,Dokken like you've never heard them,"Being an 80's music fan, Dokken was naturally one of my staples. This disc is a recording of a live show they did a few years ago in a small Redondo Beach, CA club. It is a slowed down sometime acoustic rendition of some of their hits. They do also play a few cuts from their newer albums. Don and the boys really give us a treat. The hits are played with even more feeling and dedication to the music than the originals. ""Unchain the Night"" starts the album off with a bang. I just love this album. If you are a Dokken fan this is a must have. Forget their last studio album."
3,"Important book, but out of date.","This book is a nice resource for the professional astronomer, but is definitely out of date, with its emphasis on photographic plates. It has little mention of electronic detectors or recent calibrations of cool stars in the red. The discussion of the physical effects modifying the lines is very limited. But the chapters devoted to each spectral type provide a nice overview of the subject. In summary, a good book ready for a new edition!."
3,Excellent Selection of Yemenite Songs,"This selection is a worthy continuation of the wonderful music found on Desert Wind. I do wish there were more the melodic lines of traditional Middle East tonality, but one cannot have everything. I have one negative comment. This exact, same, selection of songs, in a different order, was issued on a different CD label, titled Yemenite Folksongs. I hate to think that I now have to carry a listing of all song titles, by this artist, in order not to buy another duplicate CD."
5,A jewish singing in arabic... ¡Simply Wonderful!,"In this lines I don't wanna say nothing about israeli/palestinian conflict. Simply I wanna say: Hey, men and women of Middle East! Ofra was a jewish woman, bred in Israel, between jews, but she never forgot her arabs roots, yemenites, and sang for arabs and jews with the same beauty and talent of always. Because all we have the same God, and because arabs and jewish are brothers peoples. With ""Fifty Gates of Wisdom/Yemenite Songs"" Ofra sing wonderfully in the best album of folk music of the Yemen, with lyrics in arabic, aramaic and hebrew. ""Galbi Yahib Al Hawa"" is far the best song, tribal and mystic like few songs. Soon, in my opinion, ""Im Nin'Alu"", ""Ode L'eli"" and ""Tzur Menti - Sei Yona - Sapri Tama"" follow in beauty.A great album, wonderful. It's cannot lack in the collection of who loves the ethnic music.Sorry by my poor english. I do it by Ofra, the Queen of Middle East."
2,Not A strong whistle,I brought this product looking for something with a cheap price! And thats exactly what i got back in return something cheap. The whistle wouldnt blow half the time and when I did get it to blow it was still weak. Not worth it.
3,Decent but could be more detail in some area's,"I have expience with exchange 5.5, 2000, and 2003 and was looking for a book that would get more indepth and found this book to be very similar to the exchange 2000 24 seven book. While the 2000 version was exactly what a reader needed to get up to speed with the newer version of exchange this book should've been more detail beyond the basic exchange setup. I could've kept my money and read up on the newer features of exchange 2003 off the web."
5,White Trash Cooking (Jargon),"This is an excellent book not just for cooking, but also for the great pictures and the dialogue. I have already found several recipes my Mother and Grandmothers fixed for all of us when I was younger. Everyone who prefers simple food and enjoys cooking should have WHITE TRASH COOKING."
5,One of my favorites,"I have had this book for a number of years and I absolutely love it. To be honest the recipes aren't anything new but I am so happy that the author took the time to document these types of heirlooms. My favorite aspect of the book is the photographs which are honest, eye-opening, and funny all at the same time.White Trash Cooking"
5,baker,"This cookbook has a lot of basic and simple recipes in it that are good for every day use. It has great ideas for family ""gatherins"" I found it to be very helpful when I want to make a quick lunch, or when unexpected people stop by. It uses very common ingredients that I usually have on hand."
5,"Yes, there are really people who eat this stuff!","Having had grandparents who still had an outhouse, I found the photographs in ""White Trash Cooking"" to be a wonderful reminder of what it was like to be at Grandma's house. And the variety of recipes (many worth a chuckle due to the assembly), from Ice Tea to Kiss Me Not sandwiches will surely give you a view of how the ""other half"" lives. This book makes me proud to acknowledge my ""white trash"" roots, because yes, there are really people who eat this stuff!"
5,"You may not know it, but you may be White Trash.","This is great. The stories are hilarious and the excellent photography is a documentation of country with a capital ""C."" The recipes are pretty good also. (...)"
2,WHITE TRASH COOKING,THE FIRST BOOK IN THIS SERIES IS TWICE AS GOOD AS THE LATER TWO(HAS A PICTURE OF AN OLD GUY ON THE FRONT COVER).
3,Not too bad.,"There was much to like about this book -- an interesting setting (who doesn't love N'Awlins?), a curious premise, and the added benefit of great recipes. I enjoyed following Carolyn Blue's attempts to locate her missing friend in the Big Easy.Conversely, several elements bothered me. Carolyn never seemed real -- her character was half ""dippy dame,"" as my father would say, and half academic-from-the-ivory-tower. She never rang true to me.The plot also was a bit far-fetched, with more than a hint of deus ex machina when Julienne's brother appears from nowhere to grab center stage. We should have received at least a hint of his presence and culpability earlier in the book.Too many disparate threads -- old friends at a reunion, the chemists at a convention, Carolyn's book-writing, the strange crimes that keep befalling her, the love interest with the policeman, and feuding spouses -- that left me reeling."
3,an enjoyable read,I enjoyed not knowing until the end what had happened to Julienne and think that the clues were fairly scattered among the recipes. I'm looking forward to the next entry on the menu!
2,Disappointing,"Crime Brulee reads like a cross between tourist guides and blurbs from restaurant cookbooks. Much in the book seems contrived - from the alleged difficulty of making a roux to the slowly paced plot development of the ""mystery"" to sleuth Carolyn's consistently negative impression of everyone but herself and her husband. Maybe Nancy Fairbanks shouldn't have thanked her editor for suggesting that she write a ""culinary series."" I love food mysteries and adore New Orleans and found Crime Brulee a total disappointment."
3,A Slow Starter,"It took me a while to warm up to this one. The main character, Carolyn Blue, comes off as a snob (bordering on bigoted) and a bit unlikeable in the beginning. I know I've read another one of the series and it didn't strike me the same, so as this is the first in the series, I assume she's evolved. The book also reads as though it was written with thesaurus in hand with awkward big words used in context where more ""normal"" ones would be typically used. I didn't really detect much genuine passion for the food angle of the book either, it is more like the author is just jumping on the bandwagon of ""mysteries with recipes"". Oh well, I eventually got into it and the ending wasn't bad. I'd try another in the series."
2,Good Food; Bad Mystery,"I really enjoyed the descriptions of some of the sights to see in New Orleans and I enjoyed reading about all of the restaurants and food. However, The mystery was very weak. There were few viable suspects. I am never able to figure out who committed the crime when I read murder mysteries before it is revealed in the story. In this book, I figured out who committed the crime long before the end of the book. The main character is very pleasant, but seems not to be too bright."
1,Skip this one,"I agree with the reviewer who said the first few pages indicated that this book was a chore rather than a pleasure. I stayed with it, although toward the end I skimmed faster and faster, and gleaned no satisfaction for the efforts. Skip this one and you'll be glad you saved the time for a more enjoyable tome."
2,One of The Weakest In The JLA Run,Though not as bad as some people have said in reviews it is not a very good read. The story moves at a very sluggish pace and has a horrible villain. Though the showing up of another DC Super team really kept it from completely going downhill. I can not say I recommend this unless you've read the rest of the volumes in the series.
2,Why bother?,"Chris Claremont should have quit writing comics long ago. His time is past. This storyline served no purpose other than to introduce John Byrne's rebooted new, new, new Doom Patrol, which has already been erased from continuity by 'Infinite Crisis'. It was a mistake anyway in that rebooting the Doom Patrol in this fashion erased Beast Boy/Changeling's origin from continuity. Retconning is garbage and everyone ought to knock it off. Don't buy this volume unless you simply must have a complete set of 'JLA'. Oh, also, having the Justice League fight vampires, of all things, is just dumb. Tedious. The only redeeming quality the book possesses is an absolute knee-slapping, gut-busting sight gag in the last two panels of the story; the belly-laugh is not worth the price of the book."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This Justice League of America outing looked a little dated to me. It is done in the 1980s John Byrne style, so if you really are a big fan of that and a collector, you will like it. The story with some potential Doom Patrollers and the Justice League crossing over with a circle of vampires just didn't seem to gel, for me."
1,JLA Tenth Circle,"Terrible art, what happened to DC on this one. They allowed their greatest group of heroes to be tainted with poor art and terrible story. Disappointing,to say the least. You are better off picking some of the previous JLA collections, this one is a dud."
1,Supremely disappointing,"When I had first heard that the legendary duo that struck gold with Uncanny X-Men way back when would be doing a JLA storyarc, I wondered why DC didn't market it any further. Well, upon reading the Tenth Circle, you'll know why. It's not hard to believe, it's impossible to believe that Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the same team who brought us classics like the Dark Phoenix Saga and Days of Future Past, came up with this drek. The story, what little there is of it, involves a vampire taking control of Superman and launching him against the JLA. Now I know that dialogue has never been Claremont's strong point, but the script is so horrible that, like a previous Amazon reviewer said, it reads like this was an episode of Superfriends. Byrne's art is solid for the most part, but uninspired. There is no saving grace for JLA: The Tenth Circle, and despite the fact that it re-unites Claremont and Byrne, this should be left on the shelf at all costs."
1,so lame i was embarassed for them,"the story was terrible, the art was second rate, with all the female characters looking like the same people. the dialogue made me feel embarassed to be reading this book. what a waste!"
5,Irwin quality,"I ordered these pliers at the same time that I ordered the 6"" pliers. Only sorry that I did not also order the 8"" pair so that I could have a complete set. Many of my clamps, pliers, circular saw blades and hand tools are the Irwin Brand. Will not hesitate to buy more."
5,Dark & beautiful sub-bass ambience.,"Staggeringly beautiful glacial sub-bass sounds. If you like Main, Final, AMP, Birchville Cat Motel, Kluster, Sunn 0))) etc. you will love this. Highly recommended. Oh yeah, it knackered one of my speakers too! But that says more about the quality of my speakers really! Sub-bass to die for."
4,the shocking behaviour of a common country dress!,"The Dress never ceases to surprise with a series of sometimes grotesque, sometimes beautiful ""happenings"" involving the garment of the film's title....These include a young french girl making love with all seven of Snow White's Seven Dwarfs and a fire fight involving a group of Tokyo transvestites, while our protagonist desperately tries to figure out which one is wearing ""that"" dress......You cannot afford to miss this film!"
4,A simple de-flamatory philippic,I liked it a lot. Why do some reviewers characterize an author as narcisisstic when he talks about himself once in a while? Give me a break. Well rounded perspective of one man's introduction to the cyberworld.
2,A superficial tale of learning the internet,"The theme is enticing - baby boomer is sucked into the depths of the net. You imagine a psychological thriller such as Polanski's 'Tenant'. What is found , though, is a rather pedestrian tale of one writer's introduction to computers (? mid life crisis). Such unrealized potential. Lots of boring reproductions (filler) of e-mail. Now John, don't get upset and flame me"
2,dated but descriptive,"As might be expected, the book is very dated now. I was also on the Internet in 1993 and 1994 and don't regard myself as a pioneer of any sort. I did find Seabrook's description of online life accurate and especially the arc of a long-term presence online .. from euphoria and enthrallment to disillusion and disgust finally arriving at a place of balance."
3,What a cover and it's dull but original for biography,"Man and computer, but this guy is not my idea of a nice person. He has fun faking his identity in a chat. What happened to being honest and not lying to people? He talks about Western pioneer spirit ya well we have heard that by now. Must be the WELL because there seems to be a unity in writers from there. And yes their story dominates too much of the writing about the net. Sorry but I like community I am not a libertarian, thank you very much. It was an interesting read my own grips about the WELL aside. But then we could all write something like this but as a story of one person's personal views on the computer explosion in America and the media business it has merit. Since Bill Gates seems to be known for his relation to computers I guess this writer got to know his subject. I didn't finish it but it has some personality."
5,Pet Tabs with Iron,It is a liquid compared to Pet Tinic. Wish there were bigger bottles. Purchase thru Amazon best price. Great for older dogs and any dog not feeling well.
1,Dull and boring,"It's sad that someone who could write Ruby Fruit Jungle can also write like this. This is the second of her mysteries I've tried to read. What's with chapter three? Eight pages of boring dialogue with the ""Rev"".... Oh, well maybe she's giving us clues about the murders but this early in the book she lost me - again. I tried to push on and read another two chapters but life is too short and there are too many really good books to read."
1,This just sucked.,I think I'm done with the Mrs. Murphy books. This one was so bad I couldn't even finish it. I actually threw it away. It's time for the author to move on. These characters have become downright boring.
2,Walk in with your eyes open,"I picked this up at random. I'm a cat lover so the premise didn't sound bad on the cover. I liked the animals. They were fine. Next time, I will research a series a little better. I expected it to be fluff but I was not prepared for the almost non-stop preaching. Everyone in town is the best. Horse people are better than the rest of Virginia. Virginia is better than the north. Pity those foolish non-hardworking non-Christians. Good writting? Forget it. Just throw in another adverb inexpertly.If you like Christian mystery fluff, have at. Enjoy. Personnally, I am going now to finish the last three chapters in hopes that at the end, one cat will turn to the other and say ""Man, these people are full of crap."""
4,Whisker of Evil,"I thought the book had a lot of ""punch"". It surprised me. It is one of the better books in the series because it has an unexpected ending and an upecpected ""bad guy."""
3,Maybe my last Mrs. Murphy book.,"I have read all of the Mrs. Murphy mystery series, but this may be my last one. Rita Mae Brown has been getting a little too preachy about her own personal philosophies and this book strongly and needlessly sermonized some of her own beliefs, which I don't agree with. I almost closed the book once or twice. I hope this trend doesn't continue, as I enjoyed her past books."
3,Two Murders Linkd by Thirty Years,"Mary Minor ""Harry"" Haristeen's love life is progressing, but things get harry when she discovers the body of Barry Monteith in a creek. ""Harry"" also finds a classring in the same creek. The puzzle has more missing pieces as the ring belonged to Mary Pat Reines. Mary Pat and her favorite horse, Ziggy Flame, have been missing for thirty years.WHISKER OF EVIL has favorites Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker on the prowl to find a killer before their human gets them all murdered.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
2,If you have to do a mundane chore,"such as painting a room, or cleaning the kitchen, these books are entertaining as audio books. At the risk of sounding ""snobbish"" (which I am not) they are a cross between ""Murder She Wrote"" and Mr. Ed."
1,Beware - These don't work in the Epson R260,"I attempted to install three of the black cartridges. The printer didn't recognize any of them. I contacted the seller by email. Though they called me back, they weren't able to figure out why the cartridges failed. They didn't offer to replace them or to refund my money."
2,What Were They Thinking?,"This product is normally used to help reduce LDL cholesterol and triglycerides; however, one of the ingredients listed on the label is Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, a known cause of cardiovascular disease!What were they thinking?!This product may be more beneficial than harmful, but why use a product that contains small quantities of trans-fats? There has to be a better source of Niacin.Also, don't overdo this or any form of Niacin (Nicotinic Acid). In large doses, it can cause liver damage."
4,tarrie goes better with my ruin,"this cd is a bit repetitive but listenable...most of the songs start out good then get annoying best song is down w/ lynn strait (snot) i can listen to that song a lot with out it gettin old .....and.....would somebody tell me what came first, all is not well or releif through release?...im soo confused"
2,okay okay..originall...but it's so bad it's hilarious.,"WHAT?a hip hop goth band?my friend couldn't have believed it herself wheni told her.okay okay, so it's quite original, and it's different...and all that...but sorry...i don't like it.and i don't think it goes...i think it sounds stupid...but then again, i don't listen to goth music anyway."
5,buy it...,"Grae has taken the idea of ""girlfriends"" to a new level. The believable scenarios and situations may have you thinking about your own girlfriends!This book is well written and easy to follow. The character of Dakota has a quiet confidence about herself which allows the reader to really identify with her.Can't wait for Grae's next book!You go girl!!!"
2,"Really, Really Dated ...","This is a strange book -- kind of like watching a re-run of ""Facts of Life"" or ""Different Strokes"" -- entertaining but dated. Why Broder published this in 1980 BEFORE Carter lost the presidency is the strangest part of this story."
3,Needed John Amos back,"This was the first season without John Amos. It is evident how important his character was to the show. Instead of being a situation comedy about an African American family, it became a silly show with Jimmy Walker trying to be the man of the house. I still enjoy watching the show, but the show went down hill for many reasons after John Amos ""left"" the show."
4,Broken Chemistry,Why did they have to write James out of the show. He was one of the most hardworking dads in tv history. The show kind of fell apart after James was killed of. The Evans family kept on going after James' departure. There are still alot of great laughs in this season but also some boring ones. The best episode on the fourth season dvd has to be one where the Evans kids try to earn some extra money for Florida to go on vacation by selling underwear.......FUNNY!!!!!
1,Falling Apart,"Season 4 was when the show started to fall apart. Like, Micheal became more of a slacker than the 'Milliatant Midget'. Also because John Amos was killed off in the show. Worst Season ever."
2,"Cuff is not as advertised, nor is it as pictured","Looked like a totally different cuff from the photo. Cuff color and material are now more like the disposable ones. Bulb is also different than in the photo..Cuff is accurate, but valve is cheap and gritty feeling. Overall just not acceptable, nor is it as advertised.If you do buy it, you may want to go find a different vendor who will take returns.This Seller wants a 15% restocking fee and wants me to pay return shipping. - No Way!.Now I'm stuck with a cuff I will never use. As always, the best way to buy personal items is to go pay the retail price, where you can see and touch what you are buying. Very irritating transaction!"
3,"Nice for what it has, but a little light on content","For what it includes, this book is pretty good. Unfortunately, it misses more than it contains, so it's more a summary than a real reference."
3,Track Listing,1. Tubthumping - 3:342. Tubthumping (Butthumping Mix) 5:243. Tubthumping (Danny Boy Mix) 5:384. Tubthumping (MAWR Mix / Pablo & Lawrie) 5:125. Tubthumping (Timeshard Mix) 4:596. Tubthumping (Gunshot Mix) 5:20
1,Grammatical Errors,"This book has MULTIPLE errors in spelling, grammar, and even several places where a completely wrong word is inserted. All the T. Jefferson Parker books I've read are this way. The stories are great but there obviously is not proof reading involved."
2,Did I read the same book as all the folks who gave it 4 and 5 stars?,"I read the book first and then read the customer reviews. Lately, I've done the opposite, which has spared me from getting stuck with some really bad books. But it wouldn't have mattered with this one, which drew raves. I don't get it. I thought this book was ridiculous. I couldn't get past the 67 year old detective, who was dying of cancer and being treated with chemo, energetically hooking up with a much younger detective, not to mention his superman abilities of running, chasing, and breaking down doors, among other such feats. Every now and then, the author would throw in a sentence about how ""tired"" Hess was. Well, yeah! And at the end, there was that long soliloquy. . . Well, I won't spoil it for you, but all I could think was ""For crying out loud, call 911 and stop with the blathering philosophy."""
4,My Introduction to this author,"and I was very impressed. I read a lot in this genre and will be looking for other novels by this author. The characters are not run of the mill by any means and are written as very human. My one sticking point is the attraction between the two lead detectives..a 67 year old cancer stricken semi-retired cop and an outspoken female detective about half his age. Why must there be ""something"" between the lead characters? It just felt wrong to me. Removing that would not have hurt the book a bit...but it was still a good story."
4,This is how mystery books must be written,I just finished the book and I have to conclude it was a good read. The main characters are Vess(the old and experienced) and Merci (the unexperienced hard) in chase of the purse snatcher. The purse snatcher leaves a pool of blood on the crime scene with no futher evidence. It hunts on young females in malls and make them his prey. Pick it up if your a real mystery reader.
2,Not Sure!,"This is the first time I read this author so I'm not familiar with his writing. I did find this book to be too wordy. It could have lost about 100 pages, easily. I do plan on reading his next book, Red Light, to see if all his books are written the same.I found the story to be good but very confusing at the same time.KK"
5,Wow!,"I really enjoyed this book. There aren't many that I feel compelled to recommend, but this book delighted me on so many levels. I'm buying the author's others that I haven't already read."
2,Yet ANOTHER serial killer story...,"Reading this I was compelled to look up what James Ellroy wrote about serial killer novels: ""silly literary s**t from any standpoint ... a real-life statistical rarity and a media plague."" If Thomas Harris can't take the subject any further (and HANNIBAL shows he can't), you can be pretty sure it can't be done."
2,Okay serial killer tale until the ending,Don't want to be a spoiler so won't be specific. The ending begged for editing. This is the first book I've read by this author and will probably be the only one.
4,A Terrific Mystery,"This is the first Parker book I've ever read, and it was a wonderful experience. The characters are sharply drawn and intelligent while the plot moves at a brisk pace to keep a reader engaged. Overall, the work is a first order thriller. I've since read other Parker books and enjoyed the experience."
4,Excellent,"Thrilling, fast paced and realistic. You don`t want put it down. Parker`s books are interesting and keep your attention. Highly recommended."
5,"Ooh-Rah, Marine Corps!","I ordered this case because I am a retired, disable USMC veteran and I wanted this to show my pride (and to remember the one I lost). It is excellent, but I don't understand why it says (empty). This would imply that it had no internal 'guts'. I also bought the butane torch insert to use with this case, I like that very much. I just stored the lighter fluid internal 'guts'. The engraving is great."
2,Not so good,"I expected better sound quality.I expected simple and easy.The sound quality is okay. I rate it fair.Simple and easy. It is simple to put the ipod in the docking station and it is easy to insert the cord into the ipod.However, the picture does not show this little cord that goes into the top of the ipod. Makes one think that you just sit the ipod in the docking station and it is done.The volume control doesn't work well. I have to turn up th volume on the ipod, then turn the volume up on the docking station.Its okay. I use it in my bedroom. Its not that attractive and it plays songs.I would not recommend it and I will not buy another one."
3,for a zune,"i bought this when i had a zune... the case was actually really good, but my zune on the other hand, was a waste of $$"
1,New Age Hood,"Thugs get killed and criminals go to jail. Tired of the glorification of abohhrent behavior in our youth. Roger Troutman was the heart of Zapp and I don't think he would approve of this typre of travesty. I don't care how ""dope"" the music and the hooks are if the message is straight from Hell. Nothing positive here."
5,Excellent dogfood,"I love the product,you'll see the difference in few weeks,I will stick with it for a while.And the price for the big bag is pretty nice,love it got it have it always."
1,Terrible.,"Terrible shipping from this seller. Food came unboxed , bags ripped. But thats not why I am rating it a one star. The food made my dog throw up , and caused diarrhea. 3 Vet visits because we couldn't figure out what was wrong. When I changed the food to Royal , within 2-3 days my german shepherd was feeling much better. Would not recommend. I now have one full bag, and 3/4 of another bag sitting in my kitchen as dead weight."
3,"Good seller, Book not so much",The seller was great but the book was not what I needed for my 14 year old son. The cover might have intrigued him to open it but the formatting and content within would have turned him off. It was dry and nondescript.
3,"Wonderful singing, less than wonderful material","The Orthodox Singers Choir conveys incense and majesty every time they sing. The soloist is quite compelling in many selections. No instruments, just powerful, solemn voices raised in worshipful praise.But the material does not vary enough. It is all quite similar music, performed in a similar manner, and leaves me a little tired. And it just does not grab...none of these reach the level of Rachmaninov's Vespers, or the chillingly beautiful portions of Alexander Nevsky.A very pleasant disc, with beautiful singing, but the mediocrity of the selections sinks an otherwise glorious experience. Taken individually, each sounds good. All together, it is a less than the sum of its parts experience."
5,Love/hate this movie,So good but so disturbing!! Anson Mounts performance is amazing!! Hard to watch at times but well worth seeing. Anson plays a drug user that is not concerned about his nephew or his daughter and the tribulations they go through. Not a movie for kids since there is language and a very disturbing rape but it is a movie you must not miss
5,"Intelligent, courageous and prophetic","Intelligent, courageous and prophetic, Bernie Parrish, who lived this remarkable story, was right when his outstanding book was first published in 1971. And, nearly forty years later, he is still on target."
4,Fun read I look forward to the second book,Roberts never lets us down. Montana Sky was a terrific read. Seaswept was a page turner my only complaint is that I have to wait to long for the 2 other books that will come from this series
4,Hard to put down,This is the begining of a series that I just cant wait to finish. Of course It was a fast and easy to get into read that I finished it in 2 days <sigh> I am always doing that--reading to fast!!!! I fell in love with all the brothers and feel I know them from the inside out-- Ok but the truth is that Cameron is my favorite.. Read this book!!
3,"Great Book, Lousy Audio","I loved this book when it first came out, so when I was looking for an audiobook for a long trip, I got this one. Unfortunately I found the narrator spoke so slowly and in such a monotone that he almost put me to sleep. Rather than attempting different voices for the characters, he simply raised and lowered his voice. I found some of his ""characterizations"" so affected sounding, that I had to put the book away. As he also narrates the next book in the Quinn saga, I guess I won't be listening to this series in the future. I would give the book 5 stars, but took away 2 for the lousy audio version"
5,Great!,"One of the best Nora Roberts books I've read (and I've read them all). It was a refreshing change to have men as the central characters, and the chemistry between them is great. Can't wait for the second book in the series!"
5,Definitely another winning book by Nora Roberts!,"I thought that this was one of her best books. I loved how she went into such detail with the relationship between Seth and Cameron. I felt like I knew them after I finished the book. I think that some writers have a hard time getting up close and personal with the characters in their books, but this is not the case with Nora Roberts. I thought that Cam's relationship with Anna was intriguing and somewhat steamy, though it wasn't the best that she had ever conjured, but very enjoyable nonetheless. I would definitely recommend adding this to your personal library. I figure sometime soon, I'll have to read it again, like right before I read Ethan's story!"
3,"Good Story, but a bit overshadowed by an ethical quandary (Some spoilers)","Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the other two books in the trilogy, but as I read the book, I had this continual, nagging problem in my head over the relationship between Cam and Anna. It just is not ethical. There is no way a social worker cannot be swayed in judgement when she is having a relationship with someone she is investigating as a guardian for a child. Throughout the book, Anna makes excuses like ""you can't be my lover during work hours"". It just would not fly....she would find herself out of a job and lose any credibility she might have, not to mention the detriment she would cause to the boy if the man she is sleeping with turned out to be dangerous and her opinion of him was swayed by her attraction."
4,You'll be swept by the sea of luv!,Wow! Three brothers practically give up their lives to take care of their newest sibling when their father dies...and one by one the brothers take their turns finding luv in this wonderful beginning to a trilogy.
4,"WONDERFUL! Easy reading, perfect for that day on the beach!",Nora Roberts writes the most wonderful stories. I absolutely adore love stories and this is a classic.
4,Nora Roberts series are the best,Nora Roberts knows how to make her characters real to the reader and create an interest in seeing what hapens next.
2,A mindless read!,A story to read when tired or busy. A truely mindless read that can be dropped and picked up at any time. It's not hard to remember the predictable plot of the characters who lack morals and hop into each other's beds at the wink of an eye. The most interesting sub-plot is the character development between the boy (Seth) and the three older adoptive brothers. The ending was disappointing and the lusty affair which ensues between the main characters annoying.
1,Not-so-Swept-Away,"Nora Roberts is a terrific romance / mystery writer; however, this novel is not one of her best. I usually have no trouble getting caught up in her stories and characters, but this one left me flat. The characters were dull and what little mystery there was didn't pull me in. This one took work to finish. It is a weak start to her trilogy. Her other good stories have me expecting better from her."
5,I give this the best of the lot,"Although Ethan and Phillip's stories were good reading and a continuation of the story, I have enjoyed reading this one over and over again. And now that Seth's story came out some time ago, I would leave that one with the lowest rating. Sorry this is a short review, but if you're a Nora Roberts fan, you'll know which books I'm speaking of. Without further ado, this I feel is the best of the lot."
2,Kinda smutty,"First of all I want to say that I so wish that books had ratings like movies do. You know, rated PG, PG13, Rated R... I've read the reviews on this book and it sounded really good so I bought it. I read like 5 pages and then threw the book away because it was sexually crude and inapropriate. So that's all the review I can give because I didn't read the whole book. Couldn't even get past the first 5 pages!"
4,Book order I received...,"The copy of Sea Swept that I received came in very promptly.It arrived in very good condition;just as promised in the listing.I was more than satisfied with it,and it's speedy delivery!Thanks,Tweety Bird :)"
5,Start of a good series...,A good start to a series. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very touching and nicely written.
5,My first Nora Roberts,"Quick read and involving. Not syrupy like a romance book but it was a love story. The story revolves around adopted brothers. There are other books in the series, each focuses on one brother at a time."
5,Great,"The only other Nora Roberts books that I read were the ""Born In"" books. I thought they were good, especially the first but this trilogy seems better. I really enjoyed it _Sea Swept_. Cameron seems like the most interesting of the brothers. I hope the other books are as good."
5,Nora at the top of her game,"This beginning part of the Cheasapeake Trilogy is, so far, my favorite book by Nora Roberts.Racing boat champion Cameron Quinn is called home just as he is about to bed a dazzling model. His adoptive father, Ray Quinn, is in an accident and is dying. Cameron races in time to say good-bye and to face reality along with brothers Philip and Ethan: there is a fourth Quinn boy, Seth, another stray taken in by Ray, who now needs the three very different men to work together.Anna Spinelli is Seth's caseworker, someone who has to make sure that his best interests and needs are met. Although a romance between a caseworker and the boy's brother, Cameron, is a major conflict of interest and a no-no in real life, their relationship is sizzling!This book was a great set up for the next two installments. I loved it!"
1,Sin Ilustraciones.,Sin ilustraciones! Compre la version para kindle muy facil muy rapido pero este libro esta incompleto sin sus ilustraciones. Hay algunos clasicos que es mejor comprarlos en papel. :(
3,Libro,"Lo baje para leer con mi hijo pero aun no se entusiasma, hubiese esperado mas dibujos y que fuera mas ilustrativo"
1,Elsewhere principality,0 870Tat book was a good book but I really read it a lot so I like it but just a little so am sorry to but your eating like this but its how I like it but I still like it that book was totally almost going
2,"Sin dibujos,no drawings","Unfortunately the drawings are as important as the text on this book, and they are missing in this copy.So it is only half of the book, the price is ok, but the paper book is much better because of that."
5,Just Perfect,"This is my favorite book, i recommend that every single person would read this book, it would leave you a positive message and you'll have a better understanding of things."
1,No lo compren: no tiene ilustraciones ||| Do not buy it: no illustrations included,"No vale la pena comprar este producto porque no contiene ilustraciones. Tal vez hay libros en donde los dibujos no son importantes pero en este caso son indispensables. Es dinero tirado a la basura. Tuve que conseguir una versión completa en PDF, y gratuita.Mi recomendación es que no lo compren."
4,Rescata valores como la amistad.,"4 estrellas por este título importante para reestablecer el niño interior que llevamos escondido, recomendado a todo gruñón de este planeta"
1,just dont buy here....,"yes , yes people just dont buy here they are very irresponsible to process your order...and guess what...they ship your package and the tracking number is wrong...hey I order before Thanksgiving,and guess what ...I'm stil waiting for my package ......."
1,faltan las ilustraciones!!,"las ilustraciones son ESENCIALES en este libro, hacen a la trama del mismo. es una lástima que esta versión carezca de ellas.esto hace que el pago -cualquiera que sea- resulte excesivo.no vale la pena"
1,Kindle Version is a bit of a ripoff,"The book (El Principito) is a great story that really captures the imagination of childhood. However...The Kindle version does not include illustrations, which are pretty essential to this story. It kind of renders the book meaningless, or at least fairly confusing. This is a fairly pathetic effort to adapt the book to Kindle and a bit deceptive.The Kindle version was recently lowered in price, perhaps to reflect its poor quality. However, it's still a pretty lame version."
3,Good can be better,"The story is talked a little slow, but is very good this is a book everybody should read every ten years."
1,No lo compren: NO tiene ilustraciones,I want my money back. This is a cheap product. This book is useless without the illustrations.Deseo que me regresen mi dinero. Este producto barato es inutil sin ilustraciones.
5,Youth really learn with Everybody Curriculum,"One of the unique aspects of the Everybody model is that is very interactive and help youth to be fully engage in the learning process. I am using Everybody Curriculum in my skills building training with youth. I found students really learn a lot about this disease,their own attitudes toward prevention and how to be respectful of their lives."
4,Good Read,"How this wasn't published with a larger publisher, I will never know. This book will teach the uber-educated and the beginner alike the keys to wordsmithery. (Which is not a word, btw.)"
3,First part is like being in an advance English class,"The first part of the book is like an advanced English text book, talking about Aporia and Eponym (which were new words for me), as well as Similes and Metaphors. The second part talks about techniques, but I can't comment on it because I haven't read it yet."
4,Great commentary track from Haskell Wexler,"One of the best commentary tracks from a non-director or non-film-critic I have heard on a laserdisc or DVD. Haskel Wexler talks at length about various subjects on the technical and artistic aspects on the film.Oh, the film is great too but you already know that."
3,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,The story was very harrowing and I found it quite difficult to sit through but the acting was absolutely brilliant and it was worth watching just for that. Not a movie I would watch more than once.
5,Magnificent,Liz Taylor gives the performance of a lifetime in this funny yet heartbreaking classic. There is no other movie quite like this one.
3,offbeat,This film takes place in acutual time and starts around 2:AM. It features Burton and Tay- lor as a couple that invites another couple over after a party and then argues incessantly. I'll never stop wondering why Edward Albee included the story- story line about George's and Martha's son.
2,Liz Taylor,This film won five Oscars. I didn't care for it except a brief scene of Taylor's cleavage.
2,"How To Act Drunk - Or, What Will Happen When You Drink","Husband and wife attend a faculty party (husband is in history dept, wife's father is president of university) and get drunk. Walk home, drink some more, yell and demean each other. Wife mentions she has invited another couple over (at this late hour). Other couple arrives, they all drink, reveal personal information, drink some more. Lots of yelling and derogatory talk. Love/hate relationship with first couple. They need a divorce.I found nothing meaningful in this film. It was quite unpleasant to watch."
1,If you like depression...,"Then watch this movie. If you don't have enough marital discord and vicious fighting in your life, watch this. If you like scenes where two married people wait on the front porch while their spouses cheat upstairs (nothing graphic), watch this. If you like watching people drink (actors drinking fake drinks) for 24+ hours straight with no other food or other beverages, and stagger around the yard mumbling, then this is the movie for you. If you like having to strain to hear what they're saying, even better. If you love two hours and 15 minutes of unabated misery, in dismal black and white, then this movie is for you! If you like feeling dragged in to their ugliness and feel ugly yourself when you're done, then you will love this movie. Enjoy!"
1,Would Somebody please explain this movie to me?,"I've never heard a bad word about this movie. After renting it the other night, I still do not understand what it means. Four people get drunk and mumble all night. Maybe this was a breakthough in cinematography in 1966, but by 2000, what's the deal? Maybe I don't understand because I'm 26."
1,Am I missing something?,"I finally gave in and rented this movie since so many people rave about it? I DIDN'T find it revolutionary or darkly beautiful. I just think that maybe I ""don't get it"" as one reviewer suggested. I find Elizabeth Taylor vile and I find myself wanting to slap her hard throughout the film. I simply lost interest in their rantings and (gasp) turned it off. For the life of me, I cannot understand how someone could call this ""the best film ever made"". They must have seen very few and/or poor quality films to make such a grand statement."
4,My dad loved it...,This was my dad's favorite movie with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Their classic chemistry hit an all time high in this feature. Taylor probably has one her strongest and most memorable roles and Burton strides right beside her. It is a bit dated obviously but some things are just timeless.
3,Sad Sad Story,"My initial response to this film was total shock. I was amazed at the method of communication between the two. They are two miserable individuals who have become comfortable in a total failure of a marriage. The hate each other but are afraid to be apart. They have created a an imaginary child as a glue to somehow keep the marriage in tact ( the child being the sole reason for them to stay together). Unfortunate for both Martha and George, she shares with Honey, their young guest, the most sacred and fantical part of their marriage - the baby. She allowed someone else into their fantasy. This was the beginning of the end of their illusions. When George ""killed"" the baby, he infact, killed what was holding their marriage together... or did he? I felt very sad for the both of them. They represent to me, two miserable people are afraid of life and living."
5,Knockout drama and acting.....,"Naked power pf Albee's incisive drama play is brought to the screen in a powerhouse ensemble. In a world where Oscars are given for the performance of a decade Elizabeth Taylor would win it hands down because she sizzles, absolutely sizzles, in the characterization of a bitter wife who see-saws from the sensual, to the cynical and finally, to the pitiable. Richard Burton delivers a smash portrayal, evoking sympathy during the public degradations to which his wife subjects him and is totally believable in the deliverance of his deliberate vengeance. Dennis and Segal as the late night visitors are the dream supporting duo.An absolute bombshell of a movie !Dudley RistowJohannesburg South Africa."
5,Sublime Emotional Drama with a Punch,"One night late after a dinner party a quarrelling couple, the washed-out History professor George (Richard Burton) and his bitter alcoholic wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), is about to receive guests. When the guests, the new Biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis), arrive they find the hosts mocking each other in overt malicious intent. This makes the guests very uncomfortable, but the awkward feeling is drowned in alcohol and further sarcasm. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is an emotional drama that provides an uncomfortably good performance that will stun the audience."
2,"Great Film, Bad Version of DVD","This DVD edition was released in 1997, and the image quality is primitive, typical of many early discs. The widescreen side (yup, it's one of those silly things) gives you a floating rectangle with black all around. You'll have to use a ""stretch"" feature to make it cross the screen from left to right, and then it will probably be cropped on the ends. And then it's horribly fuzzy. But the worst thing is that it is very contrasty, with the subtle and beautiful greyscale largely wiped out.The 2006 2-disc release looks awesome by comparison. If you respect the art, spend the bucks."
5,Still holds up -- but quite hopeless,"In 2002, with an audience of young 20-somethings, everyone found this movie as fascinating as I remembered it from my youth. It still works powerfully, evocatively, at many levels, leaving many open questions, provoking debate. And it's terrifically entertaining. But it makes life in the modern world seem rather hopeless, really, no matter how you look at it.By the way, with all the mind-boggling verbal pyrotechnics in this movie, most people don't notice how thoughtful and dizzyingly innovative the editing and camerawork are. It's still as fresh as ever."
5,Outstanding,"The finest work of both Taylor and Burtons careers is fitting employed in this incredibly powerful play. Such a compelling story at your first viewing, yet complex and fascinating enough for you return to the play over and over again. If you never see another Taylor Burton film make sure you see this!"
5,It was the best movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Even though I usually don't like movies, this one grabbed my attention, and it never let go. The story line was challenging and very intelligent. It was funny and yet it was tragic. Overall it is the best movie ever made."
5,Passion that cuts to the bone.,"IMO this is one of the finest movies ever made. All four of the actors delivery the performances of their careers. The characters are developed, unique and like them or hate them every single one of them makes you FEEL.By the end of the movie you will be exhausted, exhilerated, profoundly moved and possibly emotionally disturbed.This is a true classic worth owning & watching every few years!!"
1,whose afraid of Virginia Woolf,"I thought this was one of the worst movies I had ever had the misfortune to waste money on. It was very boring and all they did is argue throughout the whole part that I watched. I left in the middle of it. It amazes me that it could have won any awards. I can't believe Elizabeth Taylor would play in such a movie. Whoever gave it high acclaim has no taste. I have never watched it in its entirety and I never will. I don't enjoy watching 2 drunks fight, how can anyone else. It had no story line worth listening to."
5,"All Time #1 Script, Play and Movie.","Charcter development, music, cinematography, dialogue and subject matter are just so far above and beyond anything we read or view today. If one loves good, dark and intense drama, both grim and hilarious this is it."
5,Convenient!,"It's great to have access to movies anytime, anywhere, as long as I have my iPad. This was my first rental and I was happy with the whole experience. Fantastic movie, too!"
5,What game should we play now?,"A 4 person descent into hell that had me thinking of Sartre's No Exit line, 'Hell is other people'. Burton and Taylor put on performances that set a standard. Purely a dialogue driven film, the writing is beyond compare. Dancing nicely between horrific, funny, and sad with great grace. There are very few films able to bring both screen writing and acting together at such a high level. The ending is particularly satisfying with big question marks pocking all the themes."
5,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,A classic film! If you've never seen this movie it's one not to miss! Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton at their best.
5,"Who's afraid? I am, George, I am...","Highly kinetic, cinematic and troubling. Enter into the bowels of a marriage based on desperate needs and disastrous chemistry. George and Martha provide the linguistic gymnastics, which, when mixed with more than enough booze and vitriol, combust on the screen with more firepower than any blood-drenched thriller. Here is emotional assualt of Ivy League caliber. The violence is all too real, and the destruction palpable. Oscar winner in several categories, this one bears up over the decades! Recommend for literate, non-sqeamish, mature and loving couples as a cautionary tale."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The acting is inspired and the dialogue acerbic, but the film suffers after its amazing first act and at times the pace crawls; WAoVW is worth a look for people interested in film (it was groundbreaking in its time) but is not recommended to people in search of an enjoyable evening."
3,Of its time and place,"So many great reviews here that I think my expectations were too high. The performances were amazing, but the action and dialog seemed too theatrical at times (not surprising as this was originally a stage play. I agree with another viewer that it felt overlong. And the denoument (no spoiler here) seemed quite contrived. Still, a classic for its time and place, and undoubtedly a breakthrough in film."
3,Liz's signature role.,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a classic film from director Mike Nichols. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton set the screen ablaze, they play Martha and George who have a bitter and intense relationship. Taylor received her second Oscar for this film. Some of the dialogue is too long-winded and overwhelming which makes this film boring at times. This satire is good just not excellent, it's a mixed bag for me."
4,Good product,I had a problem with the first shippment but no problem for Amazon. They sent me another one right away and I returned the first one with no charges to me. TThe Qatsy Trilogy is something I had been wanting for a while and it is a nice thing to have.Thanks Amazon for great service.
1,"Eye candy fans, look elsewhere.","Attention: This is not a review of the movie itself, but the transfer to blu ray. Real fans like myself already own this on different medias (DVD) and were expecting a cleaned up version.I have just received the Qatsi trilogy, and I have just watched the Koyaanisqatsi film and I am quite disappointed.And yes I'm an absolute fan of this movie, it's a masterpiece, but the transfer to blu ray is dismal.The image is grainy and jittery, some artifacts still remain in the image which is a huge let down.To be frank, I was expecting the same transfer quality to blu ray as Baraka, but quite honestly you won't find it here.I have watched it on two different tvs to make sure that it was not my equipment that was at faultEye candy fans, look elsewhere."
3,not what I expected...,"From all the hype I expected this series to be absolutely epic. It, unfortunately, is not. If you've seen Baraka, then you have seen what these movies should/could have been. Save your money and go with Baraka; quite possibly the most profoundly important movie I've ever seen."
4,World Party all the time,"Just like I remembered when they first dropped the album. Had the cassette version, and now I have the CD. Brought back a lot of good old memories. Wished that they still made music like this in the mainstream."
1,This is not Karl Wallinger,"Sorry, but this is not the group World Party, that is the name of an album by the group 2 in a Room. It is also from 1995."
5,A welcome addition,"Brad Sachs is a prominent child and family psychologist who brings a very special expertise to ""When No One Understands: Letters To A Teenager On Life, Loss, And The Hard Road To Adulthood"". This 144-page compendium of experienced based commentary and advice surveys and addresses commonly held concerns shared by teenagers and includes such topics as relationships, breakups, drugs and alcohol, parents, family dynamics, coping with loss, dealing with depression, and the necessity to put life events into a workable perspective. A gifted public speaker and workshop presenter, Sachs is also a talented writer who, as a psychologist and an author, is able to communicate with equal fluency to both teens and their parents, making ""When No One Understands"" highly recommended and thoroughly 'user friendly' reading and a welcome addition to community library collections and personal self-help reading lists."
5,"Wise, readable, and important","Dr. Brad Sachs' letters to a teen client suffering from deep depression and suicidal impulses offers a course in life everyone should take. His way of explaining behavior, how to handle dark emotions and frustration produce the feeling that understanding the logic of emotions rather than berating ourselves and others will help us free ourselves to honor life and participate with meaning. The letter form works beautifully as it is a form that allows for an elevation of thought while remaining intimate. Thank you for writing this book!"
3,some good ideas,"This book had some good ideas, but wasn't anything special to me. I gave it to a neighbor, who loved it though."
3,Sleazy sax a bit dated,"The only other Lou Donaldson I have is the very different Gravy Train, which I love, so I am not an expert on this guy in particular although I do own plenty of be-bop CDs, including those from Donaldson's band - Shorter, Hubbard, Tyner etc. Donaldson was of course a great player, but while be-bop never seems to date, these late 60s sleazy cool sax standards don't wear as well. The album is very much of its time, with a film or TV soundtrack kind of ambience - just imagine the gumshoe detective with his collar up, hands in pockets, fag in mouth, walking the streets of New York trying to figure out the femme fatale. Easy to absorb, but somewhat syrupy and a far cry from progressive be-bop. The remastered Van Gelder CD was transferred from a test pressing since the master tape is lost, but the sound quality is very good."
2,An important topic with no literature,"I got this book out of desperation, since it is seemingly the ONLY BOOK AVAILABLE on the combined subjects of FEMINISM and FATHERHOOD. As the previous reviewer indicated, this book is way too absorbed in psychoanalytic/Freudian theory for my tastes."
4,God,"When I saw the price of the article I thought it was going to be, at least, weird. However, the item was in a perfect state. Better than I expected."
5,You May Enjoy This One,"After reading through many books on ActiveX control and programming this book was a welcome relief. It is funny and witty and short.This book is written largly based on using ActiveX control in VB. Anyone familiar with VB (even if they don't know ActiveX)will get most of the jokes and diagrams.I would recommand this book to anyone that has had just a little too much technical documentation and would like a mental break. Hey, you may even learn something in the process."
4,An incredibly easy fairy-tale perspective of ActiveX,"Even if you are an expert on ActiveX, you will enjoy reading this funny-bunny book! It gives you permission to read a bedtime story again, and teaches you about ActiveX simultaneously. I read it with my night-light on!"
2,Humorous but not worth the price,"I purchased this book at a Microsoft conference at the urging of one the speakers. At the time I was already quite familiar with ActiveX/OLE/COM via C++/ATL & VB. I enjoyed the wry humor that peppered the book and the constant strangeness had me laughing at loud at times. Still, the book is done in about 20 minutes and I thought it confused COM issues more so than brought them to light. I think it would have been better if ActiveX was ignored and the focus was just on Mr. Bunny & Farmer Jake."
3,"Great writer, but you'll need another guide book","This book includes lots of interesting history and background on the Florida Keys. But you won't be able to use this as your only guide book for the Keys. No useful maps or directions are included. Also, she doesn't include prices for lodging or dining. This book was fun to read and had good suggestions, but we definitely needed more information that was not included in the book."
4,"Excellent info, though dated from 2005!","Want to know all you can about Key West and the Florida Keys, this is a great book for doing so. Though last published in 2005, it is a wealth of information. History of course doesn't change, so that part of the book remains informative.When reading reviews about lodging, dining, etc. choices, just remember that this is an older book and will not be current.Other than that, I agree with another viewer that reading this book is as if a tour guide is seated in the back seat pointing things out as you drive around the area. I have no problem recommending this book in covering the Keys. Just remember it isn't a recent publication."
3,Guide Book Lite,"For those planning to use this book as their main resource for planning their trip to the Keys - don't. This is a great ""one-person's-opinion"" guide, but it is not all it's cracked up to be. One, June is not that great of a restaurant critic. We found we thoroughly enjoyed places that June panned (like the Half Shell in Key West) and did not really care for places she loved (like Kelly McGillis' restaurant). Used as a resource in conjunction with other material, this book has a lot of excellent insight into places you may want to go. One tip: Bahia Honda State Park is even better than the glowing writeup June gave it. Plan at least one day there! If diving and snorkling are your pleasure, get another book. This one does not really cut it. Last, June captured a lot of things to do in her book, but there are about a million more. Best thing is to be flexible and hunt around for the best deals. Have fun!"
1,Very negative views of Key West,"I bought this book for a trip to Key West. I had high expectations based on the reviews. I got the impression that Ms. Keith hates Key West! I had several guide books and ended up putting this one on the shelf because every review seemed to have a negative or snarky comment. Several reviewers call her ""witty"" but I just thought she came across as negative. I didn't read the other chapters, maybe she likes the other keys better! I found Hidden Florida Keys and Everglades: Including Key Largo and Key West very helpful."
1,Surprisingly Useless,"I just spent a week in Key West and found this book to be surprisingly useless. There are unnecessary negative comments in many of the reviews, even in places she likes. There is a negative thread running through the majority of the book. I cannot recommend this book for any reason. Fortunately we had another guide book which was very helpful."
5,Read...for a better understanding,"David France did an excellent job getting the story out. Until now, I heard only fragments of the fifty year span. He brought the history of my childhood and adulthood together into perspective in relation to the Catholic church which I belong. Everything makes much better sense to me. Hopeless is not understanding. Understanding is power. Thank you David."
5,Inspirational Book,"While ""inspirational"" may seem a strange word to describe a book about the scandal of the sexual abuse of children by priests and other church figures, David France's compelling read is exactly that. While taking the reader into the depths of the despair that any decent human being - that excludes, if one follows the story, many high ranking church officials - ought to feel when confronted with the abuse, France also inspires with his story of the abuse victims who had the courage to take on not only their abusers, but the institution that protected those perverts. A must read."
5,IT'S ALL HERE.....,"Here it is; it's all here -- all the sordid details about the horrid clergy sex scandal. This is journalism at its best and most thorough. Each chapter is like reading the headlines in a newspaper (specifically a Boston paper, but that's okay). It is such a sad story but it needs to be told. Actually, of course, it is not A story, but story after story after story...... Unfortunately. Thank goodness there are still journalists out there who can tell a story without inserting themselves into it. Excellent book, albeit difficult to read about so much needless human suffering at the hands of trusted adults."
5,Lay support in Church corruption,"I have many of the books published on the sex scandal in the Catholic Church. This book is thorough and is written with clairity. The book also brings forward the untruths and extent that LAY employees will go to continue to support corruption against their brothers and sisters as evidenced on page 356 and 357 of a conversation occurring between Bernard Law and the Press Secretary, Donna Morrissey. If this woman did not resign with Law, I hope she soon does and extends an apology to the gentleman she garnerned into cuffs and to the people of Boston.The Mass is A sacrifice and here before this woman stood a live, talking sacrifice which she decided to ""be careful about precedents,"" ignoring the REAL meaning of the MASS she was participating in. Not alot has changed from the Gospels of NT."
4,Reporting-Not Writing,"Like others, I found Mr. France's account of the current sexual abuse crisis in the American Catholic Church informative, sometimes oddly compelling and always disturbing. However, I would add the following caveat. This voluminous, blow-by-blow, ""you are there"" account is written by a Newsweek reporter. I was hoping for something more than that in Mr. France's book. I was looking for a writer. Not a writer in the sense of one who uses good grammar and punctuation. But a writer who goes beyond mere reporting and can sum-up, elucidate, break-down, and articulate an insightful analysis with a thought-provoking summation and conclusion. This is a fine piece of reporting, but not writing. As such its title is misleading and raises your expectations of a deeply personal and enthralling account of this shameful time in Church history. A more appropriate title would have been, ""Newsweek Diary of A Church Sex Scandal."""
4,Great writing (a little but though),"It's heroic, epic writing. Layer upon layer peeled off this mystery that really passed me by, the author sets about the writing in such a compelling manner, it's hard to put the book down. A little but though, sometimes it seems like he's not taking sides, other times, it seems he wants you to dislike certain people involved in the whole affair, he does all this without seeming to though. But overall, buy it!"
1,Garbage,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. While accurate in describing the crimes of numerous priests and bishops, the author's presuppositions and conclusions are devoid of reality. If you would like to get a true picture of the problem and its real cause, read ""The Devils Final Battle"" by Fr Paul Kramer. ""Goodbye, Goodmen"" is also an excellent, accurate book. Most salient of all, the author of ""Our Fathers"", completely avoids the fact that the problems in the Catholic Church are the result of rampant influx of homosexuals, liberals, humanists, and modernists who continue to be ordained to this day. ""Know the Truth and the Truth will set you free. The man who sins becomes a slave to sin, and the slave does not continue in the house forever."""
1,Utterly worthless,"There were many knots (clove hitch) that aren't even represented but that's not the real problem. I gave it 1 star because following Owen's directions (and not my own knowledge of knot tying) I got only the multiple overhand knot correctly (not even the figure-8!). The Morrow book, which I thought passable, looks like a gem compared to this one...The search continues."
5,Great gift book....,We went to visit our local ship museum. My grandson was very interested in the rope displays....Decided to get this along with some rope for him. He is making gifts for Christmas now. He is ten years old. Very good book to teach young adults to move their hands and learn coordination skills.
3,Not as great as expected,"I wasn't as pleased with these ear plugs as most other reviewers were. I have small to average size ears and found these uncomfortable not because they were too hard or too wide but because they are too long. It hurts to insert them as deeply as you need to for proper noise protection.Another issue that I have with these ear plugs is that I really doubt that they're NRR33. When I wear them, I can hear sounds that were blocked better by the ear plugs I was using previous to them, the Howard Leight Max UF orange foam ones.Now I'm stuck with a large quantity of so-so ear plugs. I was expecting better."
5,Best noise reduction plugs available!!,"I am a woodworker, and use a variety of large woodworking machines, as well as gas-powered equipment (specifically a HUGE 42"" chainsaw). These are the best plugs I've used; better than howard leight, mack's, etc. What makes these different from other 33dB plugs is that they fit the ear canal MUCH more securely than other brands available. When rolled between the thumb and forefinger to a small diameter cone, then inserted into the ear canal, they re-expand to form an airtight ( and consequently sound-tight) seal. When worn while also using earmuff protection, the result is much better protection. Sometimes when using a big chainsaw, or shooting firearms, just earplugs or earmuffs alone are not adequate. Take it from me; I am also a nurse and a musician, and value my hearing immensely.The paper envelopes make it extremely convenient to put a few pairs in the toolbox, glove box, and anywhere you might need them in the future."
5,Perfect for motorcycle riding,These are the most comfortable earplugs I've ever worn. Goes in easy and comes out easy. Extremely comfortable for long periods (1hr+). Superior noise attenuation. I wear these daily for motorcycle riding and am extremely pleased. Improved my riding experience 30%+ and saves your hearing!!
5,Very comfortable for normal-size ears,"I have used Howard Leight MAX1 Earplugs for decades, both for sleeping and noisy activities like lawn mowing and using power tools. My kids also have used them, but found them uncomfortable for their smaller ears. For them we found the E-A-R brand E-Z-Fit earplugs, which are just the perfect size for them. I was recently trying to find a substitute for these smaller earplugs that I could purchase on Amazon using my Amazon Prime free shipping. (Amazon does not carry the E-A-R brand E-Z-Fit earplugs.) I tried these Moldex brand Pura-Fit Soft-Foam Earplugs because many people spoke of how comfortable they are, and some of the reviews left me with the hope that they might fit smaller ears. Well, they don't seem to be much smaller than the MAX1's, so for the kids they're still too big, and we're back to the E-A-R brand E-Z-Fit for them. For myself however, I find them incredibly comfortable, and will probably switch to the Moldex earplugs permanently."
5,Molded ear pluags,I found these plugs to work great while riding my motorcycle. Maybe I didn't realize how much noise was generated when wearing a half helmet. It's a lot more enjoyable riding with these plugs.
5,Great for motorcycle,"After a thorough review of the best earplugs to where while riding a motorcycle, I decided to try the highly regarded Moldex. Well, they work great! There is a huge difference with wind noise yet I can still talk on the phone and listen to music with the speakers in my helmet. They cut out 'white noise' great and they are reusable, provided you don't lose them taking them in and out.If you have a motorcycle, deafness is not an issue of 'if', it's a question of 'when'. Get these and save your hearing, seriously. Studies have shown that decibel levels can go as high as 130 without a full face shield and up to 109 with a full face shield...these earplugs drop the decibels by 33. So, do the math..anything over 90 will cause deafness...wear a full face shield and use these earplugs...if you don't wear a full face shield, at least you'll be able to hear for a while longer (130db vs 97db)...Don't ride without ear protection..."
5,Awesome:-)!!!,This toy is a great toy for all ages. It is extremely durable. It is fun to play with and to roll up when you're done. I recommend this toy to anyone who wants to it out.
4,awesome dvd-audio,"This disc represents an awesome compendium of new music preserved on DVD and DVD-Audio. A great listen, and worthy of your audiophile library."
3,Got what I paid for,Shipped very quickly but two of the seven vents were broken. I was able to fix them but I bought them brand new for a very cheap price. Got what I paid for.
2,The New Tarzan?,"I have just bought this Tarzan no.25 by Fritz`Leiber.I have to say that this book is totally different to the book that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote on Tarzan!It is too tedious and explaining too details on all the not important things.Although the story is very good,but reading this boook is very tiring!"
4,Essential collection from a master essayist,"Although addicted to alliteration, Gass is great once he gets going. This collection boasts a plethora of provocative (and sometimes very funny) thoughts, along with prose so great you'll want to telephone friends in the middle of the night and read it aloud to them. Of special note are ""The Writer and Politics: A Litany"", which is just that, a VERY long list of writers' experiences with political power, and Gass's masterful anti-religion polemic, ""Were There Anything in the World Worth Worship."" The latter contains one of my favorite Gassean epigrams: ""...the chief point in life is to die of something and never for something if it can be helped."" Sane words in an insane time."
1,Not much of an essay writer,"Daniel Myers is right in saying this collection is not so good. In _Books in Canada_ for April/May 2004 I argue that the collection is very poor.Gass is completely off the rails when he favours Rushdie over Solzhenitsyn, for instance, and while comparisions of that type are invidious, it does make one wonder about Gass' internal compass that he can completely sympathize with the first while absolutely denigrate the second.In general Gass' thinking process is a mess, often contradictory and, if this can be said without a brick being thrown, typical of those writers who (grow to) consider themselves philosophers or thinkers. His writing praises itself, there is too much consonance and assonance, and the lure of the jab is far more attractive to him than sober thought. It's not just the ideas that are poor, but their vehicle."
4,Heavy and Punk!,"Actually, I am a fan of heavier metal stuff (Overkill, Grip Inc., Sepultura, Testament, Pantera,Anthrax...). That is why I like this L.A Guns's CD. This one is totally different than their other CDs. It is more punk and hard-core than R'n'R. Chris's vocal sounded like he was fronting Pantera! Tracii Guns 's guitar is awsome. This is properly a good metal album for the 90's. Get it, you won't regret."
2,Not nearly as enticing as their previous albums,This album marked a stark contrast to their previous albums and was not accepted with much applause. The album is much harder edged than most of their fans expected and have recently returned to their melodic roots.
1,Frustrating,I'm still trying to figure out how American Hardcore is an option on amazon mp3 and Wasted is not!This really is their worst album.
5,"HEAVY,HEAVY,HEAVY","I think even after being a huge fan of La Guns w/ Phil Lewis, that this album absolutely rocked. I had trouble getting it out of my CD player. Songs like Kevorkian that start off slow and then kick into high gear make this a music listeners' dream. I had the oppurtunity to see them live and refining the old songs w/ Phil was no problem for Chris and his capable voice."
2,Without Phil?,"Now when I first recieved this album, I was really excited to hear it being an L.A.Guns fan, but when I listened to the first few tracks I was truly dissapointed, for a few reasons1:They changed their name to ""The L.A.Guns""2:Tracii Guns was the only original member in this lineup3:They went into the Heavy Metal scene which is NOT L.A.Guns style at all.I didnt like how they changed to the heavy metal scene because im not all that into heavy metal for 1, and for 2 because it is not L.A.Guns, this album was just a pathetic attempt to gain new fans since they started to fall off the map after the Vicious Circle flop, now dont get me wrong, I thought Vicious Circles was a great album, but this album they took it a step to far, and with this album you can tell that they were truly hurting without the vocals of Phil Lewis. The only positive that came out of this album was some pretty cool guitar riffs. I only recommend this album if your a TRUE L.A.Guns fan."
1,"Not good. In fact, bloze.","I bought this cd in 1996 expecting it to be ""L.A. Guns"" is some form and I was sorely disappointed. The gig I saw shortly therefter didn't improve things (until they closed with Rip n Tear (rocked!)). But that proves the point: This grating, poser, grindcore a) isn't L.A. Guns, and b) sucks for any form of ""music."" If I want fast/aggressive music, I WILL buy (and ideally, see) Cannibal Corpse or Killswitch Engage. Next time I buy/see L.A. Guns, I'll ensure that it's the real deal (i.e. with Phil). Aloha."
1,Sucks,This albums horrible the only good thing about it is the guitar riffs and the only reason I own it is because im a true L.A. Guns fan
1,The Life & Times of Convicted InsideTrader,"George Soros was convicted of inside trading in December 2002. He engaged in inside trading of Societe General stock.""Mr Soros and three other defendants, the court found, bought Societe Generale stock when it was cheap, and cashed in their investment when the price rose after the bid became public.Two other businessmen implicated in the scandal - Edmond Safra and Robert Maxwell - have since died.""Maxwell killed himself after his billion dollar scam/business was exposed. He dove off his huge yacht off the coast of France. He left behind billions in debts and thousands of British workers lost their pensions. Soros is known by the people he associates with.It is not to hard to ""stay ahead of the curve"" when you trade with inside information.For more details - go to the BBC news web site and search for Soros insider trading or Google and type Soros BBC insider trading."
4,A reading to continue growing in life,"Good book, but too much philosophy on it. I was expecting more practical tools. Good to understand the mindset of one of the best. Anyway you always learn something to apply on a daily basis. Recommended."
1,Suspiciously in tune with credentialed leadership in Europe and the USA for a man who made his fortune betting against the exp,"Horrible, boring read; his ghostwriter should be fired. Also suspiciously in tune with credentialed leadership in Europe and the USA (for a man who made his fortune betting against the expected). Example: in this book Soros emphasizes the need for the Euro. He is either brain dead or shorting the Euro and making money off of those who are long. I suspect the latter."
3,What you'd expect from an assisted autobiography.,"Parts of this book are very interesting, particularly where they deal with Soros' marginal experiences prior to starting his famous hedge fund. It lends a human picture with a past to this powerful person.However as you make your way through the book, it begins to sound like many other books written by famous people at similar points in their lives. There seems to be a need to prepare oneself for a certain kind of statehood existence, and this is no exception. The last third of the book was a little bit tiresome.I would reccommend the biography as a companion to this book. In fact, sometimes it seems like this book was written as a reaction to the biography which was published at about the same time."
5,Kant will reward your tenacity,"Once one becomes familiar with Kant's special terminology, Kant's aesthetics unfold in amazing way. It's probably best to start with an overview such as Copleston's ""History of Philosophy"".The one criticism I would offer is that Kant, however brilliantly insightful, clearly was not an artist. His insistence on there being no rules for beauty may seem true for the average non-artist person and create mediation between supersensibles (and give rise to much bad art in the process). But at the very least, there are really big hints as to how we perceive beauty, gestalt psychology being an example. Otherwise, as art history has proven, there is no universal validity to beauty.Edit: One month, two readings and the binding has already failed."
2,You kan't get away from your own presuppositions,"Kant is a genius; I give him that. Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world. His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely ""objective"" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts. Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure."
1,Freaky Printer Errors Cause You to Lose 1/3 of the Poems,"Well, I got this ""free"" on paperback swap dot com, so I suppose I shouldn't complain, but on page 4 this book starts over from the beginning, and instead of giving you pp 5-36 gives you pp. frontispiece-xxxii AGAIN.This means you miss the end of Poem 1, the totality of Poems 2-29, and for some reason Poem 31 is also omitted.You do get Poems 32-98, plus prose selections (early diaries and journals, letters, and devotional writings) and modern critical views. (Oh, also remember that you do get the table of contents and pages i-xxxii of the intro TWICE!)Please, someone tell me that I got a freak printing of this book.I'm no Gerard Manley Hopkins expert and I just wanted a general introduction, so this will suffice, but it is definitely disappointing."
4,A view of Scotland,"""The Blood is Strong"" is a great way to introduce yourself to one of the best true Scottish bands, giving you a flavoring of what they can do, both instrumentally and vocally. The songs are culled from their work for a reason, though - they're the soundtracks to 3 films done by independent British TV. The instrumentals, ranging from moody to danceable, and the vocals, featuring the superb voice of Karen Matheson, catch the feelings of the Highlands at their best. I find myself drawn back to a family trip of a few years past that took us through the beautiful land of my fore-fathers. This CD is better listened to with the knowledge that it was done more to convey a feeling of a country than a ""greatest hits"" of a very talented group of musicians. If you want that, then ""Dawn to Dusk"" would be a better choice. If you just want to bring out the Gaelic in you, then buy this very well done musical collection."
2,Certainly not their best.,"This was the first Capercaille album I bought. I've since bought many others and love the band, not just Karen Matheson's vocals.But this CD was a huge dissapointment. I'd heard some Capercaille songs on compilation CD's before I bought this, and chose this CD because it had a large number of tracks.This is not the Capercaille I've grown to love. This CD isn't even what I'd call Celtic folk. There are about 3 or 4 decent songs on the album. But the rest are a mix of keyboards, synthesizers, and echoey voices. Strange, foreign, and altogether nothing like I expected.If you are looking for a place to explore Gaelic folk music, I'll always recommend Capercaille. But try ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" instead. I also recommend the band Solas."
4,pretty cool design...,"First time I ordered from Body Candy and their delivery was prompt, but the shipping charges were almost as much as the item itself.I like this belly ring--no sharp edges to hurt you. It's the first time I tried a spiral twist and it was a bit harder to insert. My only complaint is that the screw ball fastener is plastic and the twist is metal, so it's not going to last that long, but for the price, it's worth the short time."
1,disappointed,"My first Sallis read.Had high expectations,thankfully it was a very slim book.Long on the slow bits short on the fast bits.To me a lazy story"
2,Long on atmosphere and short on plot,"Long on atmosphere and short on plot or action, this slim novel ultimately disappoints. The plot follows a retired government assassin who is called upon to abandon his life as a sculptor to track down a former colleague who has turned freelance. Sallis captures the depressing bleak atmosphere of small-town strip-mall America, but there's not enough a a story to make it all worthwhile."
2,Oven worked great died fast,"When the oven worked, it baked the pizza perfectly, I even made casa dias on it. The problem is it died after 3 months, and the company wanted me to ship it to them at my expense and they would repair it and ship it to me at my expense. By the time I would have paid shipping, it would have cost me more than the original purchase price. I took it apart to try to repair it myself (Bad resistor)but the part was custom and no electronics store carried it. Would not reccommend."
5,Crisp Crust,"I bought the oven specifically because I like to eat leftover thin crust pizza and I like it to have a crisp crust. This oven works very well for this purpose. I use the dual control and it only takes about 5 minutes since the pizza has only been refrigerated, not frozen. The pan inside is very easy to wipe clean, too. The oven in my kitchen does not have a heating element on the bottom so I have tried many different ways to get the bottom of my pizza crisp. A pizza stone did not work and I finally had to put a lid over the pizza so that the bottom would cook more than the top. Using this oven is so much easier, has solved my problem, and I'm using very little electricity compared to heating up my large oven."
1,enjoy it because it won't last,"I actually had two of these. The first lasted about a year, and I liked it so well that when it broke I bought another. The second made it three months. It's a great oven when it works."
2,Only the good die young,"When the oven worked, it baked the pizza perfectly, I even made casa dias on it. The problem is it died after 3 months, and the company wanted me to ship it to them at my expense and they would repair it and ship it to me at my expense. By the time I would have paid shipping, it would have cost me more than the original purchase price. I took it apart to try to repair it myself (Bad resistor)but the part was custom and no electronics store carried it. Would not reccommend."
2,What the ?,"I purchased two Deni Pizza Ovens. The first one made a really great pizza and then refused to work again, so I've sent it back. But, I like this product so I'm giving the second one a whirl. Yesterday it made two great pizza's, but tomorrow nights pizza party will convince me to reorder another or send this one back too!"
1,Shipping rates,You all are ripping people off with shipping rate. This is against the law to charge double for shipping rate. I work for Fed Ex and your rates are not correct for shipping
4,Great painting!,This painting is exactly what is shown in the photo. Real paint on a real canvas (not a print). Looks great and the price is amazing for something so well done. My only complaint is the shipping. I ordered two paintings and they came in an oversized cardboard box face-to-face with no insulation or padding. There was also a big giant hole on the side of the box which more than likely happened during shipping. Luckily there was no damage to the paintings.
5,Diva Delight,"You really have to be a fan of QVC, America's leading retail broadcasting network, to appreciate this book. And if you are, you will! Within these pages, The Diva of Diamonique reveals everything! Secrets, desires, hopes and regrets. It's all here. If you watch QVC, you don't want to miss this book.How she can keep her hands off that impossibly handsome Dan Huges is simply beyond me! He makes my morning every single day! With his Morning Show, at 7 p.m. EST.Kathy's book is a real joy to read! Although most of us will ever get the chance to meet Kathy in person, this book offers us a personal look into her life.As a Proud Gay Man, I am not ashamed to admit that Kathy is a role-model for me. And my dream is to someday meet her. And maybe then she will introduce me to that hunk, Dan Hughes!!!"
4,NICHE ... Finding It and then Knowing You've Found It,"Kathy is truly one of those people anyone will feel comfortable talking to about anything. She is comfortable talking and being infront of the camera which is obvious to anyone that tunes into QVC. Kathy could sell mud on the air and we would be happy to buy it. The book is amazingly forthright most of the time but does gloss over some important events in her life. Too little is said about the change from hired employee to contract employee, this is a major move and how her co workers feel about her ""Diva"" status. All in all the book tells enough to be entertaining without being mean to a single soul. Well done."
3,good book,"The book wasn't in the best of conditins, but was readable and I enjoyed it alot. I realize it is an older book and would explain the condition. Good seller and quick delivery."
4,great story,very pleased to learn about long ranging of this spectacle in Tuscany' RN ABOUT THIS IN BOOKS AND NOW ON DVD
4,Rich documentary that takes you into another world,"Very interesting documentary about the yearly Palio horse-race throughthe streets of Siena, where each horse represents a differentneighborhood.The nearly religious fervor the population puts into the preparationsfor the race, and the intense emotions they put into the results arefascinating. Among the highlights are the sections about a 92 year oldwith the energy of a man 35 years younger, who still holds the race asthe center of his being, and the generally splendid photography.Not a super deep or emotional experience, but a wonderful chance to geta look inside a culture without almost any exposition, just images, andthe words of the people themselves."
3,got scared,"I was once engaged to a wonderful divorced man with a child until I panicked and called off the wedding. I really miss him and was hoping to find courage in taking on the stepmother role. But I cannot agree more with Ms. Dowdall's review below that this book is packed with information but is depressing. Reading it, I felt that perhaps I had been lucky to get out of the relationship in time. If I am judging solely the information contained in the book, I would give it 4 stars, but for the negative emotional impact, I would have to give it 2 stars, coming out to be an average of 3 stars."
1,Bitter and Negative,Unfortunately this book was very disappointing -Was looking for inspiration and insight but instead found negativity and resentment issues.Not recommended
2,"hmm, not what i was looking for...","i havent finished this book. probably won't. I have no children of my own and am planning on becoming part of a family with my boyfriend and his 2 children (deceased mother). And after reading the book, i feel like most of the information is common sense... it just seems like my idea of a stepmother is exactly that.... not a mother. another female other than the mother helping to raise the children... right? do most people not feel like that? (these are my questions after reading most of this book). i will keep the book for reference. but it wasnt very helpful. more confusing for me."
3,Best Stepmom book I've read so far but...,"This book gave good advice about being true to yourself and not being jealous of and insecure about your new family. However, like all the other stepmom books I've read, it focuses on the negative and the problems. Almost every example used is of a bad stepmom situation. I would have liked to read about success stories and what good stepmoms do RIGHT not wrong. I could not relate at all to most of the stepmom examples in the book. I also wanted advice on what to do if you love your stepkids too much, but that subject was merely touched upon."
3,"Helpful Info, Truthiness in this book","I ordered this book based off of all the positive reviews it included. While I did find some helpful tips, this was a difficult book to read. It was very matter of fact and a bit doom and gloom.The book seemed to focus on you having an ""out"" for your marriage too. It was a very tough read.It is also more helpful for those that have been married previously and have children from a previous marriage."
5,An important compass for every stepmother!,"This book not only clarified my role as a stepmother, but helpedme better understand my husbands situation as well. This wasthe first helpful book I have read on the subject ofsteparenting. The best parts for me are the ""Action Boxes""at the end of each chapter...they really aided me in taking aproactive role in being a sucessful stepmother. I am very thankful to have this book and refer to it often."
4,"A ""been there"", ""done that"" manual of stepmothering","Besides the obvious audience of current and wouldbe stepmothers, this book should be in the hands of all counselors, therapists, and social workers. Like books on good manners, Ms. Norwood maps out strategies for overcoming the difficulties inherent in the role of stepmother and dispels the myths that cling to the title. It could have been more tightly edited, as there is some repetition, but the overall message is plain to see: it takes more than two to tango."
3,More Comedy than Mystery,"This book won numerous awards for Best New Mystery of 2005, including the prestigious Anthony, McAvity and Agatha awards. I enjoy a good mystery, so I purchased the book based on the prizes and the good reviews.The book is well done, but is written more in the style of a madcap farce than a traditional mystery. None of the characters believe in a realistic manner, and a lot of the twists in this book are over-the-top.In short, this book is fine if you're looking for a comedic novel, but I would skip it if you're looking for a mystery/crime novel with a realistic plot and three-dimensional characters."
3,3 stars is generous It's A Chore to Read,So dissappointing as to be a chore to read. I looked at the book several times before purchasing it. Then wished I hadn't. The behavior of Wollie is more than a bit unrealistic. That would have been ok had the story been told a bit better. Too many things going on to follow with any ease. Although it has a few moments that make it rate 3 stars I was glad to get to the end. Perhaps as with a few other series the second book will be better. Check it out at the library before spending your money. If you like Janet Evanovich and sarah strohmeyer this is not for you.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!,"I am so sick and tired of celebrities getting their books published because of their names. People, there are real authors out there! This book, and I use that term loosely, is so poorly written, edited and put together, it's not even laughable. How sad that publishing, like everything else in our world, is more obviously about greater profits and bottom-of-the-barrel quality. Send a message to them...Don't buy crap like this. Just read the first page before you buy. It's all you need do to see the truth."
3,Disappointing when so much is done well,"Please read the plot summary; I don't like to redo it. This book has an engaging premise and the author is a fine writer, two characteristics that can be hard to find in the semi-cozy mystery genre. Wollie is a well-drawn character but the others who populate this novel beg for more time to explain their characters.What should have been an enjoyable and occasionally scary read quickly became somewhat onerous, as plot twists became so convoluted as to bewilder the most seasoned reader. Add to that several false, repetitive climaxes and one is rather pleased to reach the end of the book"
1,Wow was that bad,"Based on all the recommendations of others, especially about her second book, I decided to begin at the beginning. Yikes was this bad. Poorly written and her characters border on the retarded. What could have been humorous turned out to be sad. Too bad she didn't just stick to a book about the dating experiment. I think I might have cracked a grin once during one of the dates."
3,"Good, not great.","This is a delightful, entertaining first novel much stronger on characters than plot. But that alone made it an fun read and enough to probably make me look for her next book."
3,A Good Read,"This is a good light read. Those who like Janet Evanovich will probably enjoy this author. The plot was intriguing and kept me guessing most of the way through. The characters were funny, if not sometimes over the top with their antics.At times the similarities between the characters of Evanovich's Plum series and the characters in Dating Dead Men were a little too glaringly obvious. The main character, Wolley, is much like Stephanie Plum in that she acts brave while secretly being scared. She does crazy things and has crazy friends. And her love life gets her in trouble. Wolley's good friend and co-worker, Fredreeq, is much like Plum's friend Lula. She dresses outrageously and speaks her mind to everyone. Consequently, I found myself making too many comparisons between the authors and their books.Overall the book is well-written and enjoyable. Definitely a good choice when you're looking for something not too complicated, that will make you laugh and leave you feeling good at the end."
3,She's no Stephanie Plum,"I bought this book based on several reviews that compared Wollie to Stephanie Plum. While it's not a bad story, not once did I laugh out loud.I'm waiting for Ten Big Ones for my next big laugh."
3,Funny but convoluted,"I was recommended this book because I have read (and loved) all of the Stephanie Plum series and supposedly this was along the same lines. Well, the positive is this book is very witty and fun. The sensitive character development, especially of Ruby and P.B., is heartwarming. Now the bad part, this book was very hard to follow. I felt like everything was going off in different directions. One reviewer nailed it, it was like reading two stories in one. There is a certain amount of flow missing in this book. I recognized the author as an actress and I like her. For a first book, not bad but hopefully she will learn from her experience and improve on her next one."
5,Great Album,"Mr. Wolf has created a pop gem with this latest album. The combination of familiar forms with abstract sound create a beautiful record and one that will last longer than this year. I wont go into comparisons, because he sounds like no one else, but he pushes the boundaries of pop music like Bjork and it provides great results."
5,The legendary Music keeps Rockin!,"If you love the old stuff,well this cd is for you.I have had it for about 3 months.I play it everyday.It dosnt seem to get old and boring.When music is good,you can listen to it everyday.They have some ballards,some old time rock and roll.But you listen to it,it seems the old band hasnt lost a beat! icq 2475649"
2,All right. but....,"This reformed Lynyrd just doesn't have the energy of the original. This album isn't too bad if you don't compare it to the 70's recordings. The guitars sound rather lackluster and the tempos, especially on ""Voodoo Lake"" and ""Home Is Where the Heart Is"", are plodding in comparison. Watered-down, it reminds me of one of those biographical movies they make about a band or musician where they don't actually use any of the artist's(s') real recordings."
2,This album just isn't that great Skynyrd sound of old,"I have tried my best to like this album & the other post-reunion albums from Skynyrd, but I don't. Johnny Van Zant is a little too much ""rebel yell"" whereas Ronnie was a great singer songwriter. The guitars all sound the same. There is nothing even remotely as creative as the Gaines crystal clear solo in Sweet Home Alabama from the great 70s live album One More from the Road. They are now down to only 3 originals out of 7 members in the current band, which doesn't help credibility a whole lot, either. I would pick up 2nd Helping or Street Survivors instead. If your looking for some great recent southern blues music from the 90s try Where It All Begins CD from the Allman Bros Band."
4,Black?,"These cd-rs feature a black writing surface. It makes it look like PSX Disks. They work fine, as good as any blue/green surface CD-Rs.Recommended."
4,"great cds, only one gripe","I bought the 50-cd spindle of these and only one was defective! The quality is excellent. The only problem is that if, like me, you write the contents of the cd on the cd itself, these ones don't give you much room; you can only write on about half of the disk. Also, from an aesthetic point of view, the disks (which are black and a sort of weird orange color) are ugly as all hell. But if you're not too concerned about appearance, they're a great buy."
1,Careful ! they didnt work on my DVD,My Toshiba TEcra 8100 dvdrom drive could'nt read them at all. I am going back to the normal CD-Rs
2,Be careful,"The disks look cool, but my Dell Inspiron 5000's internal DVD/CD drive completely ignores them. However, they work ok in my external sony USB CDRW drive and in the few Macs I've tried them in."
2,Don't buy Memorex BLACK CD-R's,"Just so you know, I bought these with the assumption that they were the silver disks listed in the picture above but I received the ""Black"" version and about the only thing I can use these for is recording music for music CD players and my HP 820 burner. That's it. It writes data to the disk fine, reads fine in the burner but when I try to read it in a another desktop or notebook w/o a burner, it cannot read the CD in data or audio format. I've used the silver version of these CD-R's and they work great on all my CD devices."
3,Anyone else have trouble reading these in DVD drives?,"I usually don't review products (other than networking and security books), but I want to share my troubles with these CD-Rs.I have no problem burning to these CD-Rs, and I can read them in any CD drive I've tried. Unfortunately, my Thinkpad a20p's DVD drive does not recognize these black CD-Rs as valid media. At work, my Gateway Profile PC DVD drives can not recognize the black CD-R either. That problem severely degrades the usefulness of these CD-Rs.I'm curious if anyone else has encountered this problem. I shared my findings with the maintainer of a CD media FAQ, and he stated he'd heard such problems before."
3,Buy another brand!,"I used memorex for the first cd I burned. Originally I bought a 650 mb CD-R's. But then I decided I needed a 700 for those times when I need some extra room. I was disapointed in the pack I got, while the the first five on top were 698mb cd's, the ones under them were 648mb, the size of the cdr's I originally bought.So while yes, I've never had a bad cd, they don't all have the right number of megabytes. I'm just waiting for Amazon.com to come out with the 800mb ones."
3,"work well, but less room to write on them","These CDs work great for burning and for 50 of them, what a deal! However, I find the color inconvenient. With all but the bottom half of the front of the CD black, there's that much less room to write info about the artist & title. Next time I'll pick CDs with more space to write on the front."
1,Some Problems with Memorex CD-R media,"I have had some problems with the quality of Memorex high density media. First of all, when I played my copied cds, they had unusual popping noises that were especially apparent during loud sections of music. Not only this, there was also a noticable background hiss. The media burned well, but the after some use, the label and reflective top layer began to peel away in some areas which would create large breaks during playback, and in some cases, prevent the cd from playing at all. Although this occured on Memorex green-gold 700Mb media, the color of the media does not affect playback, and I would expect the same problems to occur on this black media, unless the black media is manufactured differently, which is doubtful."
5,Flawless Music Performance,"As a professional musician I use CD-rs to make demos and short run albums for stage sale. These have been perfect, and a decent price for the quality. The look of the black disc is different, but I never notice while it's playing!"
2,"Great Looking, but....","I was totally psyched to burn CDs on these Black CDRs. I already picked up a box of ten and they worked great. The problems began when I got a 50 disk spindle--so far I burned about 40 and of those I now have 10 very cool looking coasters. I never had such a fail rate before, and I do a lot of burning. I used to use the Kodak Gold, and I was hoping these Memorex Black disks would replace those old favorites...Still, maybe my spindle was a clinker--also, on a couple of the CDs I sucessfully burned, there were skips and strange sounds when I played back on my stereo--I don't mind the occasional flukey CD, but when burning a lot (I run a CDR label) I need consistency and these lovely looking Black CDRs have me wondering. Still, they ARE way cool looking..."
4,in response to pahamrick,"Just wanted to clear up a little 'misinformation' ;-)pahamrick, it is lighter colors that reflect more light, hence their bright appearance. black actually absorbs the most light, from sunlight to the light from the laser in your cd player. since I have not used the black cd's, I have no comment as to their performance, I only suggest that it is not the reflectivity of the color that makes them read better. maybe it is their non-reflective properties that give them better performance."
3,"Great looks, wakes you up",This little trooper looks great on the night stand and the alarm is very effective. In some cases it is a little too effective (induces panic from a dead sleep) and since there is no snooze you always run the risk of turning it off and falling back asleep. It may be more effective if you place it across the room from your bed.
4,A nice story,Good book about what happened to two different Jews during the Holocaust. I don't feel that it really portrayed the horrific events of the holocaust justly.
2,Holocaust? or Love Story,I thought the book was too complex and I thought it was a nice love story but they made the Holocaust seem like a cakewalk which it wasn't
2,Basicly a Fastgraph manual.,Even if it does discuss some interesting matters this book really is just a tutorial on how to write games using Fastgraph. If you plan to write your own low-level routines or use another graphics engine you don't get much help from this book.
3,"Good for beginners programmers, not others","This book provides code on how to implement a portion of the code that a user may use in order to create a game. However, I can not and will not recommend this book to any non-beginner programmer because if you get a copy of the graphics library, you can find enough information on the Web (free, at that) to outweight the cost of buying this book. Non-beginner programmers, save your money. This book isn't worth wasting it on"
4,"Well-written, packed with information","Noted game developer Diana Gruber provides step-by-step instructions for writing action arcade games in C. You will need to know something about C programming before you start, but there is plenty of sample code to help you along. The companion disk includes complete source code for thesample game developed in the book, some helpful game development utilities, a copy of the Fastgraph/Light graphics library, and additional sample games. Gruber is the senior programmer at Ted Gruber software, creators ofFastgraph. A well-known online personality, she has been writing games since 1987, and is a contributor to several industry publications. I like Diana, and it made me smile to imagine this book being narrated in her voice. This is a clearly-written, no-nonsen"
1,"I don't want to learn fastgraph, i want to learn game prog..","First of all, it would be helpful if they showed us how to resize video memory anyway we want instead of showing us a freakin' function call. Stuff like that comes up when you read the book. You learn basically nothing from the book, only how to use THeir Functions. Oh well it's dos anyways"
4,Will keep you moving,I bought this CD a while back and have dedicated it as my workout CD. If you're latin or just love latin music with a kick you will love thid CD. Every song will have you up on you feet shaking your hips to the beat of the drums. .
1,bad timing is just bad acting,"Art garfunkel should stick to music where he has much talent. In this film he plays a man 'obsessed' with Teresa Russell and there is nothing obsessing in his acting or his emotional delivery that makes us think that.The chronology mish-mash isn't interesting and the so-called suspense element is just too long to be effective. I couldn't help laughing at every cigarette consumed in this movie-trying to copy an art film, Garfinkel looks like a poor example of the Marlboro man he is trying to portray.Who is going to believe that someone like Russell would fall for Art in the first place. If I could have given this movie less then one star I would have. Save your money!"
1,Bad Timing DVD,"Mail service by the seller was fine, but the DVD did not work. We tried it in several players, but to no avail. When I emailed the seller, they said they would give me a credit and just keep the DVD. Why should I keep a DVD that does not play? Wasted postage, but what else can they do. And I still don't have the movie I wanted...."
3,An Intense Look At Sexual Obsession,"I saw this movie ten years ago at a Harvey Keitel retrospective, but all that is really memorable about it is Art Garfunkel's performance. Art's Lipton Flow-thru Is Right Out There."
2,Bad Timing,"I don't know what movie the other reviewers saw, but this is not a good movie. It moves real slow and the acting is bad. I barely made it through. This is a good movie to pass on, it's not worth watching."
2,A strange film,"This review is for the Criterion collection DVD edution of the film.Bad Timing directed by Nick Roeg is the story of a psychoanalyst played by Art Garfunkel who is having a relationship with another man's wife. The story begins with her being rushed to the hospital after a drug overdose and the previous events are shown in a series of flashbacks. A police inspector attemps to ascertain what has happened as well.The film contains some graphic sex scenes and is not for the easily offended.The DVD contains some bonus features which are an interview with director Nick Roeg, producer Jeremy Thomas, and actress Theresa Russell, a theatrical trailer, a slide show of production photos and posters of the film and some of Roeg's other films and deleted scenes."
4,"Good quality, low price",My four Borzoi (Russian Wolfhounds) really like the taste of the beef formula and they are picky about what kibble they will eat.
3,Not my dog's favorite,"I have a 95 Lbs Lab/Mastiff. He eats about 4 cups a day...I used another brand before but was tired to pay such a ridiculous price so I tried this for a little bit.I'm not really convinced, it's not bad or good, just Okay.It's cheap which was what attracted me.My dog had a little trouble to get used to it at first but now he is fine. Although, dog owners will understand, this food makes his poop hard to pick up..."
3,"Probably great for some, but...","I bought this for my german shepherd because of the label ""no wheat, no corn, no soy"". He seems to be sensitive to those things. After going through a bag of this food, his allergies are worse than ever, he even has scratched bare patches on his hind end now. I guess he is allergic to barley too. I wish I had paid better attention, barley is the second ingredient, and is a cereal grain just like wheat. It's a shame, because my dogs like this food. I just bought a second bag before I figured out the problem, I'm going to have to donate it and go hunting for another affordable dog food that my shepherd can tolerate."
3,Stop raising the price,Great brand of dog food if only they would stop raising the price! Please keep it the way it is.
1,Salmonella. Great.,"I just bought this brand of dog food for the first time because I was trying to find a cost effective quality food for my dogs. Not a week after it arrived, I hear on the radio that they have had to recall because people not pets were getting salmonella poisoning from handling the food. Thankfully my wife and I were able to avoid that unnecessary risk to our health!!! Now I had to waste my precious time to get the food out of my house and fill out their recall paperwork. Fail."
5,My dog loves it!,"We've had our dog for only a few months, but we already know he isn't picky. We've tried a couple of foods and he ate them, but none with the fervor that he does Diamond. He actually enjoys this brand and I enjoy the price.Plus, I love that the first ingredient isn't corn. What dog naturally eats corn as a main sustenance in his diet? Really. And that's mostly what pet foods consist of! I don't get it, so I won't buy it.Diamond isn't as natural as you can go, for sure, but it's enough to give a tightly-budgeted family with kids peace of mind when buying dog food.Shipped quickly."
1,DON'T MAKE YOUR PET SICK. MY DOG DIED FROM DIAMOND CONTAMINED FOOD,"This brand killed my 8 year old dog. he suffered a lot. The bag was contamined with Salmonella! DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND, AS THIS IS A DANGEROUS COMPANY!"
3,Too Salty for Me,"Ever since I became disabled living on social security I've been eating dry dog food with milk from my goat for dinner.Thought I give this brand a try but it was much too salty for my taste.I'm going back to Purina. I especially like the puppy formula, much easier to chew."
5,Our dog enjoys the food - quality seems about the same as Science Diet,"We moved from Science Diet lamb and Rice to Diamond Beef and Rice. Our dog, a 8 year old 75lb Rhodesian Ridgeback, enjoys the food (she enjoys all food.)and we're feeding her the same amount as before with no changes in weight since the switch. We're on our 2nd bag and I believe this is a good quality mid grade food and we will continue to use it as it offers good nutrition at a great value. I appreciate more than anything that Diamond has not increased price by reducing the weight of the bag. 10 years ago a 40lb bag was standard and now most brands are selling their ""big bags at 35lbs or even less. Just like with people food, price increases are often disguised with reduced quantity in similar packaging. Bravo to Diamond for not jumping on that bandwagon!"
2,Sickening for my dog,"I'd heard good things about this brand, and the price was good, but this formula caused a lot of digestive upset to my dog. We transitioned him over several weeks and tried to stick with it for a while after that, but the gas never ended. I think the brand is probably still good, but after seeing how many others have had problems with this particular mix, I'd try a different flavor."
3,Tribal fans will like this CD!,"Alright, I'll admit it, this CD caught my attention for two reasons. One, I gleamed the name of NY house DJ Lord G. I like his style on NY radio station KTU, so I assumed this CD was an extension of his talents. Second the marketing tactic of incorporating a NYC subway token, now extinct, caught my pop culture eye. Well, people, learn from me, THESE ARE NOT REASONS TO BUY A CD. Cutting Records put out this compilation. 10 tracks of Latin flavored house laced with tribal riddim's! Produced by Lord G, Track 1 New York Tribe showcases his production skills. Skip along the CD and ride some grooves, as this experiment in tribal house can at times get monotonous and just as quickly grab your attention like The Rio Deals Ella Ella produced by Norty Cotto. Keep your hand on the skip button! Caveat: This CD is not mixed."
2,mediocre,"From a recovery point of view, this book will not change your program or anything. It's one of those quick knock-offs that someone did when they needed money. I liked Mel B's work on ""Pass It On"" and the book about Ebby, but she really sold short on this one. You could simply read the chapter titles in this book and you've read the whole thing. And while vaguely illustrating her points, Mel wanders off into conjecture and personal opinion, and admits that's what she's doing!"
4,returned for full-size.,"I really like the shade and got a lot of compliments on it. I returned it for the full size version because the sun was still getting to my little one.-Easy to install-Easy to put away-I could still keep it on when I folded my stoller although I would not recommend storing it that way.-Because of the angle of the sun in the evening, we needed a little more protection for my baby's fair skin and light eyes.-Pay attention to the trim color on your stoller. I originally bought the navy one to match our green stoller, however the handles and everything else are black (duh!) and I prefer things to match. When I purchased the full size version I opted for black."
5,Great!,This shade works great- used it for a Florida vacation and it kept the sun off my six month old entirely. I have a MacClaren Quest. I like the fact that it folds up so easily and fits in the little bag as well. I also like the fact that I can fold up the stroller with the shade attached with no problem. Great product!
1,Wrong shape!,Whoever came up with this design must have been an idiot. There is a reason umbrellas and most sun shades don't curve upwards -- the reason is that you don't want to get hit by the sun or rain when you are facing it! This one appears to want to re-invent the wheel and of course fails miserably: when the baby is facing the sun this shade does not do anything to cover his/her face. What a waste.
4,Improved but not complete coverage,"The Compact Protect-a-Bub fits on my Kolcraft Contours stroller, a stroller similar to the Jeep umbrella strollers. The Bub is easy to put on and remove. I recently took a trip to Hawaii and stored the Bub with no problem. I tied it on upon minutes of receiving our stroller. The shade protects my baby from the sun more than the stroller's own shade. However, at certain times of day, the sun still shines directly on my baby's face. Many times the sun still shines on her feet. I would say that the bub provides the same amount of coverage as the sunshade on my BOB Ironman running stroller. I wanted better coverage, so I probably should have purchased the more expensive Bub that completely covers the stroller. Overall I am satisfied with the product other than the occasional sunny face issue."
4,Very Pleased,I was needing something to go that little extra to help protect my daughter from the sun....well this is it. It's easy to put on and off. I'm really glad I found this product.
4,Great coverage,"We live in (very) sunny Spain and most canopies were not cutting it! I bought this to use on our InStep jogging stroller. It fits perfectly and covers almost her whole body. I gave it four stars because it does not look beautiful next to my pretty pink stroller but keeping the sun off is more important, right?"
1,doesn't work on Chicco car seats,"The description says it works on most car seats. Well, it doesn't work on the chicco car seat. I have tried tying it in many different ways, but have yet to be successful. It is so frustrating that my husband usually winds up having to walk away from the situation. I was very hopeful about this product, but have been entirely disappointed."
5,It works great!,"I use this everyday for my baby's Maclaren Quest. It works pretty well. It's easy to put on and off, and most of the time you can just keep it on when folding the stroller too."
3,Miss my stroller umbrella for coverage,"Before going on a cruise, I had bought my son a Maclaren umbrella for his stroller. Because he can't help but play with it, he ended up breaking it. I thought I'd give this a try since I wouldn't have to adjust it and he wouldn't be able to move it. Well, I was disappointed. It fits great on my Triumph but it's very floppy. The kid can't see anything in front of him. I thought it'd stay arched like in the picture but it doesn't. Moreover, his legs are fully exposed. The shade gives him no shade at all. It does provide more than the original canopy coming with the stroller but nothing compares to the real umbrella. I will try to re-fit it again but I will probably order another Maclaren umbrella anyway. All in all, not recommended for the Triumph."
4,Versatile,"Good versatile product. I bought one for my smallish stroller to extend its canopy and then I bought another to provide a sun shade over the car seat. The ties that connect this canopy to the stroller are long enough and the shade is flexible enough that it works for either use, and I'm sure I could find more uses for it. I've been using it (not gently) for a month now (I don't remove it when I fold up the stroller) and have not seen any damage or frays at all. I am very happy with this product, which is why I bought a second one (it's better than having to keep switching it from stroller to car seat)."
3,Awkward on my Graco Cleo,"I'm still trying to figure out the best way to use this thing because it's awkward on my Graco Cleo. It covers the stroller and stayed on in the wind, but it just doesn't look right. For some reason it looks like it's tilting on one side regardless of where I position the ties. I also can't get it to cover my baby's feet - only a problem if your baby is barefoot a lot. Maybe the regular protect a bug is better."
4,"Finally, a readable business book!","I have a large collection of business books which I've purchased with the best intentions of finishing each one. I hardly ever make it past the second chapter. Damn, they're hard to read! Not so this book. I found myself curious to find out what would happen to Bill Partridge next. I was also curious about how he would use the Internet to magically transform his business. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no magic solutions. The decisions he made were challenging and sometimes painful. The story felt very real. The Internet didn't even show up in the story until some 280 pages in! It was a fun ride and, unlike with almost every other business book, I enjoyed myself and learned something at the same time. Nicely done!"
5,Very interesting,"A good, well-rounded look at a lot of different martial arts. There is the usual ""my art is the only good one,"" but if you look past that this is a fairly good overview of a lot of the better-known martial arts."
3,Ok book,"Was a bit disappointed because I thought it would go into the different types of martial arts than it does. My son is in Tae Kwon Do, so I think it will still be interesting to him."
3,Martial Arts Encyclopedia,"Very comprehensive reference for a MArtial Artist to be to attempt to figure out what they would like to pursue. Very good book and simple to follow. As an experienced karateka I would have liked a little more detail on basic moves, philosophies, and contacts for further information on each discipline."
2,slow delivery,"The order process was easy, the book is great like I expected, but the delivery took for ever.I ordered several items on the same day from other companies, all came just in time except the book from this company, they should change their delivery customs to speed it upRegina"
4,Italy Coffee Table Book,"The book is beautifully photographed. It has pictures of some out of the way places that some of the other brochures and books don't touch on. If you are looking for information, this is not the book for you."
1,I don't think it works.,"I used it for almost three months, combined with the sprays, I didn't see one iota of change in any of my five cats. The one who started spraying still sprays and the nervous one is still nervous."
4,Great for nervous cats,Our fat calico is a nervous nellie. She needs some assistance calming down & these plug-ins help do just that. We have 3 plug-in units throughout the house & need to refill each one about once a month.
2,Feliway Refill,"For me (my two cats) this didn't do anything to improve the bad behavior going on here. No chill in the animosity between the old & new fur-ball, they're still in hate with each other. The one thing it do was give me the most horrible allergies! I had the thing plugged in for at least 3 weeks- maybe 4, and I was so sick the whole time. When I finally put it together that the plug-in was the culprit (yes, I'm a bit slow!), I unplugged it and was instantly better! Just something to be aware of- if you have insane allergies."
2,Didn't work for me :(,"Worth a shot, but this product didn't mellow my cat out at all. It got here quickly and was less expensive than the pet stores."
4,Phew! It really does work!,"After losing one cat I decided to get another as, Little Joe, was very clingy and lonely after Fred passed away. I brought home a 7/8 month old kitten from the shelter who was very friendly and playful. Little Joe became almost obsessed with the new guy (Junior). He watched and followed him every second of every day AND night and kept making a strange throaty noise with every movement. I was getting upset as I was starting to think getting Junior maybe wasn't the greatest idea. A friend recommended Feliaway as her vet had recommended it. I tried it and after 2 or 3 days all was right with the world. I know it works as he reverts back to his old ways within a few days of the diffuser being empty.I'm very glad someone discovered/invented this stuff. They should receive some kind of award.And ordering on line is the best place to order as the larger pet store chains charge a small fortune for one!"
4,"Cat Scratch Fever, No More","This seems to be the only product that calms our dopey cat named Gus Gus from his anxiety which leads him to use our entry welcome mat as a piddle place. Since using Feliway he hasn't had an ""accident"". Although the price is a bit high it's worth the cost in replacing mats as well as potential repair of our hardwood floors caused by his damaging urine. This also acts to calm our multiple cat household, helping to avoid conflicts and the always annoying scratching of the furniture."
4,Helped Greatly.......,"This was an awesome improvement in my multiple cat household. Stress and illness caused much inappropriate urination and now I see an 80% difference in this. Very little clean ups and also stress levels have decreased, thusly the fighting has almost stopped. I would definately recommend this produst to anyone who has nervous, or, cats going out of the litterbox. I use the plug ins, one per large room. Seems to really do the trick."
2,Product does NOT match picture,"The picture shows a diffuser and a refill bottle. I have used Feliway before and the product itself is great, but, AblsolutelyPets sent me refill bottles only titled 'Comfort ZONE W/FELIWAY REFILL 48ML'. If you were expecting the product to match the picture, it apparently does not. So, 2 stars because I would rate the product itself as 5 stars, and 1 or 0 for the deceptive lack of a product description past the title and the deceptive picture which implies both a diffuser and a refill bottle. Note: to use the product requires both the diffuser which plugs into the wall and the bottle, which can be purchased separately as a refill, that contains the Feliway product."
4,Wow!,"I was VERY surprised that this product really worked! I never would have purchased it if a friend hadn't recommended it. I only buy it online though, when I buy it in pet stores, it's at least twice the price on Amazon. The only thing I don't like is how quickly it seems like it run out (about a month). Give it a try!"
2,Description does not match product recieved,"From carefully reading the description, one would think that this includes both the diffuser and the Feliway. That is not true. You get a great product, but it is ONLY the refill. Two stars for misleading product description."
1,Oil Leak,"I purchased the Feliway Comfort Zone plug-in, because my 6 month old kitten has not stopped biting since we adopted her 2 months ago. She is biting my husband, my dog and myself. It has been so bad that my husband had to go to emergency from an infection he received from one of her ""pit bull-like"" bites. This was recommended by someone at the SPCA and, having tried everything else, we decided to give it a try. It was very disappointing. After a week of having it plugged in, there was no change in our kitten's behavior and the unit leaked oil all around the electrical outlet! Fearing that this may cause a fire, we discarded it immediately. That was almost $40 thrown away and we still have a mean little kitty in the house."
4,Farnam Comfort Zone Feliway original,"Make sure that you only buy the Farnam Comfort Zone Feliway because the other brands are inferior to this one. My cat actually sprayed where the other brand was plugged in. Also, the trick to this product is that it takes a few months to really get into the air of the whole area that you want it to work in. I made the mistake of thinking that it did not work after a month. It did start working but now I see much better results. In the beginning, my cat had only one relapse but since then, she has not sprayed at all. It is expensive for me because I plug one in on the upper level and one on the lower level of the house mostly where she lays. There are four cats in the house and they do seem a little more mello. I still have the occasional tiff but the spraying was the real problem. Check amazon and other online sources for better prices. Cheaper when you buy in bulk."
1,Dont waste your money,"I read the previous reviews on the product which made it sound so good... before I committed to buy over $100 worth including the 2 refills from this order- Dont waste your money...I have not seen any change in my 2 most agressive cats they are still fighting and marking where ever they want- by the way they are two spayed females in a home with 11 other spayed or neutered cats, in fact they have now started to attack some of the other cats. it sounded so good I am very disappointed it didn't work and its been over a month....."
2,didn't work for us,We tried this and it seemed to work but then the other day our cat decided to mark the leather sofa. :(
3,does felliway work?,"NOT REALLY SURE. THE CATS SEEM TO LIKE HANGING AROUND THE PLUG-IN, BUT ARE STILL SPRAYING AT THE BOTTOM OF MY STAIRS EVEN WHEN I FATHFULLY USE THE SPRAY ONCE A DAY."
1,Worse than ineffective,"The refill was an additional waste of my hard-earned money, as the diffuser has proved completely ineffective--and I was so bemused by the advertising that I decided to go ahead and order the refill along with the diffuser itself. Surely, the manufacturer knows this product is more likely than claimed to be a huge disappointment, as well as a misuse of Amazon's usually excellent web site."
3,Not Sure If It Works?,"Bought this per vet recommendation because our cat was peeing on our bed. I'm not 100% sure of it's effectiveness, it left a light lavender smell in the room which was nice."
1,"Had no effect on my cat, just my wallet","I really wanted this to work. I used it for 3 months and spent about 40.00. Unfortunately, the product did not help with my cats anxiety separation issues or aggressive behavior. So I still have the same problems and less money."
3,Not what it used to be!,I ordered 2 Feliway for cats refills. I put them up in my house and one is already used up the other 3/4 gone. These refills used to last 2 or 3 months. Not the new ones! Very poor performance on this product.
5,Wish I hadknownn about his product earlier!!!,I have rescued many cats. This product has made my life much calmer (not just the cats). The amount of cat urine on the floors and elsewhere has dramatically increased. The cats are friendlier to each other.
3,cat distress problem,these are somewhat helpful but my coon cat -when anxious-sprays-and sometimes even with 3 in the house -it may help-and sometimes -not.
4,Feliway Refill,"We have many cats that come in the house. This is a good product, but with a number of cats, you still have to continually look for their marking their territory."
2,Linda,"Unfortunatly, this product did not stop my cat from urinating under stress. It seemed to mellow her out for a day or two but then her same behavior started within a few days."
5,"help for ""crazy"" cats","I have a rescue cat (13 years old) who apparently was abused as a tiny kitten. She has had serious problems with nervousness, restlessness, and inappropriate toilet habits ever since we rescued her when she was four months old. The difference in her demeanor since I started using this product three years ago is almost miraculous. She is so much calmer and seems peaceful. If I forget to change the diffuser about every four weeks, I can see changes in her behavior, especially in her elevated frantic attempts to get away from anyone attempting to pet her. She is 13 years old now and is usually a very contented cat."
5,Comfort Zone - 48 ml refill - Feline Behavior Modification Plug-In with Feliway,"This product has totally changed our cat's behavior. For years we have had litter box & urine marking problems in addition to our cat pooping anywhere other than the litter box. We have taken her to the vet numerous times and this time the vet recommended Feliway. Ever since we've had Feliway in the house, our cat has become the ""perfect"" cat. Urine & poop in the box AND covered. She appears to be more relaxed and peaceful too.If your cat has anxiety or behavior problems, I strongly recommend you try this product. I also recommend you purchase this product from Amazon rather than your local pet store...you'll pay twice as much in the store."
3,Feliway Diffuser,I'm not so sure about this product. I had the diffuser plugged in my living room and my cat still sprayed within 10 feet of where I had it plugged in at. That kind of discouraged me.
5,Miracle de-stresser,"I just moved with my cat after being at our last place for several years. When I brought her to the new place, she was very stressed and anxious, and spent over 24 hours refusing to come out from under the bed, wasn't eating, and wasn't using her litter box. I had tried to lure her out with treats, catnip, etc, but she seemed uninterested and depressed. I plugged this in and within 10 minutes, she came out from under the bed and began to eat and rub up against me, roll around on her pillow, and use the scratching post.I had initially bought one of these before when we used to live with another cat and they didn't get along, but I think the room I put it in wasn't contained enough, as it seemed to have little effect on either cat. This time, in a smaller and more contained room, it seemed to be a miracle product. I am going to buy the spray for next time I have to put her in her carrier."
1,I've given this a full try and it simply hasn't made a difference,"I have three cats, two of which are male. The two male cats pee all over the house. They pee on the bed, the carpet, the bath mats. It is not a physical problem (both healthy) but rather behavioral. I think they prefer soft surfaces to pee on. I have tried, quite literally, everything I can think of. They get lots of love, raw food, have two cat trees, tons of toys, and get outside time- but the peeing continues. I know I am up into the $1,000s when it comes to how much I have spent on things to fix this issue. I have been using Feliway plug-ins as well as spray for almost 2 years now. Right now I have 3 diffusers plugged in my house. I have never noticed a difference. I keep buying them because I keep hoping something will change, or that it will at least help them relax but have noticed no difference."
1,Not working,"I have a male cat who ""sprays"" around the house....I was hoping this would relax him and stop these actions...not working..."
5,"Settle down, lads....","This little bottle has been plugged in our family room for a month now, and I have to say, I think it's working. We have three cats, 2 of which are male, and there's definitely a battle for supremacy going on, feline style. But for the past week, we haven't noticed any spraying or marking, and there have definitely been fewer spats. Just bought a refill."
1,No joy,"Unfortunately I didn't get the result that so many others achieved. I guess my cats are simply too stubborn or willful for this to modify their behavior. Oh well, it was a pricey experiment that failed."
5,Great folk music,"This Capercaillie album is very well set up and it is a pleasure to listen to, recommendable to anybody who loves celtic music.Kurt KönigROYAL RECORDS INTERNATIONALHEERLEN / THE NETHERLANDS"
4,beware,I'm a huge fan of Was Not Was.For you folks thinking you found Ozzy's song Shake Your Head from the out of print album Laughing at Tornadoes think again.This is a new remix and nothing like the original at all.Otherwise it's a great collection.
5,CDP Review,This product was provided in a timely manner and in new condition. I would buy from this source again if opportunity presents itself.
3,"Like the looks, it's just the function","I have this travel system in Sahara and agree with the other reviewer. The stroller basket is not accessible when you have the seat in full recline (like when you use it as a travel system with the car seat!). Also, it is a pain with shopping carts as it sits up very high. Probably the only other thing that wasn't mentioned is that it is not compatible any jogging strollers, so if you want to try to use the Keyfit seat with one you are out of luck. I really liked the looks of this travel system, but if I had it to do over again I probably would have bought a Graco because of function (big basket, fits shopping carts, compatible with other strollers)."
1,I wish I could have rated it 0 star,"I decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it. I watched it with my girlfriend. Bad idea... The sex scenes are bad and very short, and the rest is downright boring. This movie is simply bad, and slow, and generally laughable."
5,best quality transfer i've found,"The double DVD ""Of Human Bondage/Blood on the Sun"" is the best quality transfer of the film ""Of Human Bondage"" that I have been able to find. It is extremely difficult to get information on the quality of DVD transfers for films which have passed into the public domain. I went through several other editions before finding this transfer. While there are a few places where frames have been lost, the picture and sound quality are superior. An excellent film which deserves Criterion treatment--and by the way, how about a Leslie Howard Collection on DVD? Where are ""Outward Bound"", ""Berkeley Square"", ""It's Love I'm After"", and ""Pimpernel Smith"", to name a few?"
5,Nice,Great looking rod fit and finish are excelent. Cant wait to wrestle a few blue fish to shore with this rod. Maybe even a nice striper.
4,oops,"waited for years to see this movie again, got it shoved it into the vcr and nothing but skip and jump it was awful, you could watch it if you played it in ff, but the seller was a good sort about it they told us to pitch it in the trash can which we promtly did, and they refunded our money, all and all other than missing the movie we wanted , it was a very smooth transaction"
4,The very best bar fight scene you will ever see!,This is one of my favorite movies. The bar fight scene is the best and most honest you will ever see.
3,Kind of simplistic,"This latest edition continues the tradition of essays that are models of clarity, with only occasional missteps, like claiming battery cable connector bolts are specially lead-coated. I was disappointed to see the illustrations, once a highlight, have suffered a little since the last edition, and that some advanced topics like valve jobs and turbo repair are gone. Previous editions seemed to offer an alternative in a crowded field of similar books, aimed at those who already know how to do the basic jobs, but this last has been dumbed down and joked up, just another ... for Dummies title."
2,Displeased,"When I signed up for this manual I thought that I was going to be able to select the kind of car that I thought that the manual would be for.Not too many years ago the automobile manufacturers used to produce a manual for their cars but they got cheap like almost every manufacture does in this world today. You can buy these manuals now from a auto publisher for $140+. Thats highway robbery.Your manual is pretty fair for ""general"" automotive work."
2,Hard to get into & doesn't really stick with you.,"The title is one way of saying there are ""no hooks"" to this album. Now it's not like I'm demanding it be a hair metal album. I realize Dokken couldn't stick with the '80's routine. And I actually like the sound of this album a lot. The last song, in particular, sounds great and more than the others is somewhat memorable.But most of the album sort of passes through my head pleasantly enough, leaving no memory at all. And that's kind of sad.Great band. Great players. I don't fault the performances or the sound. But the songs really don't connect, I'm afraid."
1,a reviewer from massachusetts,"the cover art say's it all,a buisiness man with his heart in a zip lock bag. this cd was a buisiness deciscion made purely for profit.on this cd the band went grunge and also did a beatles song.the grunge was probably lynch's idea,i bet don is sorry he ever did this,but unlike lynch,he didn't sell out his fans.this whole cd is bad and the band isn't getting along and it shows.after this don did two cd's with guitarist reb beach,and kept them rock he really snubbed his nose at the industry,(a true star) now metal is back i hope don replaces lynch with john norum again,or even better michael denner from king diamond and mercyful fate.as for this cd stay away from it you'll be sorry almost as muh as me,i bought the xtra track version."
1,Zero Stars Gawd this is AWFUL,"This is as bad as faux grunge can be. No harmonies, no guitar solos, no sing along songs or anthems. Just a lame attempt to hop on the grunge bandwagon. George said the purpose here was to kill Dokken...mission accomplished. Ignore the 5 star reviews by idiots saying ""updated sound"" or ""into the 90's"". Aerosmith, AC/DC, Black Sabbath all survived the 90 and are alive & well without updating their sound. But Dokken is RIP."
1,Disjointed,"As good as Dysfunctional was, I had hopes for more of the same on their new release. Boy, was I disappointed. The whole album seems thrown together and not thought out. Lots of noise, with bad lyrics sung painfully. I agree with the previous reviewer - SAVE your money. I can only hope the new release due soon (with Reb Beach) is more in the Dysfunctional style."
4,"Dokken at their, uh.. un-Dokkenest, but still good music.","I hate to see this album slagged because it's really great music. I guess so many people's expectations were shattered when they heared it and realized that Dokken was trying something new. I've heared many rumors, one in particular claims that George Lynch was trying to ruin the Dokken name by taking total control of the production and making a crappy album on purpose. I say that's a load of crap. Listen and you can tell that George, Don, Mick and Jeff were totally into what they were playing.I say if you played someone this album and you didn't tell them it was Dokken, they would probably dig it. If you want classic Dokken, then buy the newest albumLightning Strikes Again- Lynch isn't playing on it, but you'd never know it.Shadowlife is maybe not the best Dokken album, but a good album nonetheless.."
4,"Dokken and Co. show the ""grungers"" how to do it!","While it's not my favorite Dokken album, I would have to say it's my favorite grunge album. If the grunge bands could actually play their instruments, and could halfway sing it might sound a little bit like this and could probably be tolerable. I can understand why Lynch did not want to do the same Dokken sound though, the songs were starting to all sound the same. If you are looking for the same Dokken grind as always this is not for you by any means. But, if you are willing to hear some true musicians tackle the grunge era and make it sound pretty good, then give it a whirl."
2,3 parts grunge + 1 part dokken = just 1 part dokken,"The problem with this CD is that the guys are making a very heavy handed attempt to ""update"" their sound into what is currently popular. Nothing wrong with maturing, but come on guys! Do you really have to imitate Alice In Chains or STP?? Please!!There are a couple of decent tracks, but when you look back at Dokken's library, there are several releases in which EVERY song is great.Luckily, Erase The Slate shows that they have realized the error of their ways! :) Too bad George is not around, though Reb does good work.Don't buy this unless you are a very diehard fan."
2,"Unlike the vidoes, this rain is real!","This is a hard album to review; if the Dokken monicker were missing, a good third of this is one deadly post Seattle record, by way of Kings X. But it came out as Dokken so in spite of some forward moving riffs, and spitfire guitar solos (remember these were still out of vougue in '97), this gets weiged down with all of the baggage that this once gleaming star from L.A. has now been reduced to aping a genre that is from Seattle, which might as well be Mars. (and guys, there's nothing wrong with Seattle writing, it's CLOUDY up there 10 montns outta the year, what do you expect their songs to sound like? freaking sunshine?) Third song in and this little experiment pretty much nosedives, picks up again with some head snapping riffery, then back down into that massvie puddle of woe. I'm tellin' ya though, put this out as an unknown breakout act, and it would've been a different take. Don's psychedelic meanderings not withstanding. Paste this review to ""Dysfunktion'"
2,Dokken's weakest effort ever,"It is not the worst thing I have ever heard but it is not good either.They try too hard to be something they are not ,attempting to be grunge or something just does not work for these guys.I have just got there latest ( Lightning Strikes again)Lightning Strikes Againfrom 2008 and it is really good even without Lynch.Dokken fans you can pass Shadowlife up ,it is not worth your time or money."
1,Not at all representative of Dokken's other music,"Dokken is, in my opinion, the best hard rock/light metal band - ever. Their classic three albums - Tooth & Nail, Under Lock & Key, & Back for the Attack, remain their best. Of their newer albums, Erase the Slate sounds closest to the classics. Unfortunately, Shadowlife is nothing like their other albums, in style or sound. Not for Dokken fans of the past who want the classic Dokken sound, and not what I would ever recommend to someone interested in hearing the band for the first time. Dokken is about soaring vocals, searing guitars, and a dark-yet-melodic style. Shadowlife is a misguided attempt at the Seattle sound. I would also highly recommend Don Dokken's Up From The Ashes album, which is excellent, and has John Norum on guitar (he has just joined Dokken as Reb Beach's replacement)"
1,This is not the trademark Dokken sound anymore.,"What I really wanted with Dokken is their music. Unfortunately there is no hope in this album. George Lynch technical playing slowed down and worse they tried the grunge sound. Maybe they are capable of playing grunge but this album is a failure. Jeff Pilson sounds much better during his Dio stints than in this album. For Dokken fans who emphasizes their trademark sound SAVE YOUR MONEY! For those followers who wish to know how a band undergoes maturity, perhaps you can try this one."
2,Dokken meets Soundgarden - weak release.,"I've been a big Dokken fan for over 20 years, but I agree with a most of the negative reviews here. There are maybe three songs on here worth a second listen - most of this is pretty old-fashioned and uninspiring filler material. Sounds like Dokken got caught up in the grunge craze that is not their style, and it resulted in this mostly dismal recording (yes, some of it sounds like recycled SOUNDGARDEN). I got this only because I am a completist for Dokken material. I still think their best ever was Tooth and Nail, but anything they did in the 80's is worth buying as is Don Dokken's solo UP FROM THE ASHES. Unless you're a Dokken completist like me, pass this one up. However, if you're into the ""Seattle sound"" (which I am not), this might actually have more appeal then to those who are longtime Doken fans."
2,The Worst Dokken Album in the Catalog,"Being the Die Hard Dokken fan that i am and i do mean DIE HARD,i gave Shadowlife a chance even after i read how much Don hated this album and how George Lynch wanted to ruin the name Dokken.Well for starters the logo has changed (only for this Album) which sucks,they are attempting the grunge rock sound which is horrendous to begin with,and the songs arent even close as good to anything in their entire catalog.I mean if i had to pick one id say ""Puppet on a String"" is a decent track but other than that this is the ONLY DOKKEN ALBUM i dont listen to or give a near perfect rating to.Get ""Long Way Home"" or ""Lightning Strikes Again"" instead."
1,Avoid!,I listened to this one twice before relegating it to the dust bin. It almost hurts to listen to it -- especially for old Dokken fans. Even George Lynch isn't impressive.
1,Not Rokkin With Dokken,My friend Mike was dead wrong when he told me to buy this. Save your money and buy the Greatest Hits (which hopefully no songs on this disk appear).
1,"Dokken, Down The Drain","Just Read The Subject...That Statement Consists Of My Words Towards This Album, It Just Sucks...What Happend? Why Didn't George Lynch Do Something About It?"
3,a reviewer from massachusetts.,"this was a very good cd! most of the songs were good songs,sky beneath my feet,cracks in the ground,and hello in particular.the only problem was(as usual) mick brown banged the drums so hard it hurt to listen to it!"
1,Do waste you money on this,"If you think this album is classic dokken please litsen to me, this album is pure alternative crap,the only cool song from this work is on the japan version of it and that song ""Deep Waters"" is not a 1/5 of what dokken can offer in other albums please buy another dokken album not this one"
4,Yes - 'Keys To Ascension' (CMC International),"This beautifully-packaged 2-CD release was recorded live over the course of a three night stand performance in San Luis Obispo,California in March,1996.It boasts of a gem of a line-up of:Anderson,Squire,Howe,Wakeman and White.I wasn't even aware that Howe or Wakeman had anything to do with Yes anymore.Newly recorded tracks include ""Onward"",""Be The One"" and the twenty-minute epic ""That,That Is"".I sort of dug the Paul Simon tune they play,""America"".Anderson's vocals certainly give the classic a nice touch.The only two tracks here that I recognized were ""Roundabout"" and ""Starship Trooper"".'Keys To...' is pretty much aimed toward BIG-time Yes fans.Perhaps a little to artsy-fartsy for some.Great sound mix and production."
5,Excellent Live Album,"Yes really lost their way in the mid 80's and after trying to get it back and failing several times they tried again with the classic Yes line-up, apparently to see if they still could. This album of their live comeback shows us exactly what a live album should be. Hearing the boys as they are meant to be heard, live, is worth the price alone. The two studio tracks are not lacking, in fact they're quite good but I would have liked it to either be live, keeping in tone with the rest of the album or they should have been saved for a separate studio album of new songs."
4,Great recording,"I don't know how other fans feel, but I always felt ""The Revealing Science of God"" was one of their more beautiful pieces. So when I saw that it was performed live on this disc, I grabbed it. The recording and performances on all the live tracks sound fantastic. Great new material too. It's so nice for me to grow older and have my favorite bands still adding joy to my life. Now if the Kinks would record again, then I'd be in heaven."
4,Half a good Yes album,"They could have combined the studio material in this album with that of ""Ascension 2"" and left out the live stuff. With very few exceptions, the live material was on earlier live albums."
3,Bad timing,"This album is the reason Yes currently languishes in obscurity. I like it, but I (and everybody else who reviewed it, I bet) am a huge Yes fan. I was thrilled that the new album had a live version of ""Awaken"". Most people were not. I was NOT thrilled that there were only two new songs. Those two songs are very pedestrian by Yes standards. It was pretty clear to me that ""That, That Is"" was several different songs thrown together into one, which is pandering to everyone who refused to listen to Yes after/because Steve Howe quit. Don't get me wrong, there are nice bits-- it's some of Chris Squire's best work in awhile. But it's tiresome. ""Be the One"" is OK, though. Kind of radio-friendly, even. Rick Wakeman was AWOL on the studio tracks, for the most part.The live stuff is a nice momento of a nice concert. It's not going to win any new fans, though."
2,Doesn't last and too short,"This overrated grip doesn't last and is too short for any normal sized racquet. I know tourna grip sells an XL version, but why sell a grip that is only good for racquetball racquets? Very annoying."
1,Poor and out-dated product,"This may have been an okay product 10 or 20 years ago, but I found its construction just cheap. I just doesn't do as good of a job compared to other modern overgrips, and it really doesn't last. Actually, I'd say that Gamma grips that I used 10 years ago are better. My wife who is not a hard hitter also tore one up after a short amount of play and didn't like it. Overall, I am surprised at how popular this product is and can only assume it's all the paid endorsements.My strong opinion is that this product is obsolete. There are many newer, more advanced synthetic overgrips out there. By far, my favorite (in the same ""dry"" style not ""tacky"" as the Tourna Grip) is the Gamma Pro Wrap. Usually, it is also cheaper. What really sets the Gamma Pro Wrap apart over others I've tried is that the edges are reinforced whereas the others are just cut strips."
2,Fell Apart,We purchased two of these chaises and the wheels came apart and the chairs developed cracks. The glue turned white and desolved all within a month. We glued and clamped everything back together and sprayed them with spar varnish in hopes of salvaging them. We had also purchased the matching bistro set which had the same problems. Hopefully they will last awhile now. recommed you spray with outdoor varnish before you place them outside.
4,Light means light,Don't want to use for Yellowtail. We had one snap. Great for bottom fish if you don't hook into a monster.
5,Great all around hooks for many fish species!,"I've tried alot of hooks in the past, but these Mutu Light hooks are the only hooks I use now. I keep stock of different sizes for different species of fish. These hooks are the sharpest hooks on the market and stay sharp for a long time. Other hook brands tend to dull after a few fish, not these Mutu hooks. I use them for channel catfish, largemouth bass, crevalle jacks, bluefish, seatrout, and redfish. I'm sure they are very good for other species of fish too."
5,365 Saints:your daily guide...,Got this book to learn more about lives of the saints in a painless way. This is definitely doing that.
1,Not quite what I'd hoped for.,"Yes, this book has a saint for every day of the calendar year, however, most of the information for each day comes from the author's reflection or questioning of the reader, rather than from the life of the specific saint. I was hoping for a little more biographical or legendary material. Actually I was hoping for a LOT more than what this book provides."
3,Look elsewhere for meaningful reading,"I liked the author's upbeat intro, designed to break down any suspicion or boredom one might feel in the face of this material. But the body of this work seems overly reductive. The book is infused with a new-agey focus and an excessively chirpy tone. Despite my attempts to give the author the benefit of the doubt, I found myself increasingly unable to trust her conclusions (lessons she draws includes clinkers like, ""I am not growing older, I am growing better"" and ""how important is food in my life? Do I use food or do I let it use me?"") The saints might have a hard time recognizing themselves in these pages."
3,It wasn't what I expected,"I found this book interesting and it was an easy read. Every page has a date on it including a small paragrah on a Saint specified for that day.I liked the fact that each day has a thought or insight to ponder and apply to your every day life, but I noticed the bulk of information was the author's thoughts and opinions.I was looking for more information on the Saints, and from this book you really only get a few tidbits (i.e. two sentences of where they are from and what they are known for). Then the author describes how you can emmulate that person.Not very educational and not really what I was looking for...but if you just want a daily dose, then this is for you."
3,Not the best book on saints.,"The book, 365 Saints, is not what I expected to read. It only gave a brief description of the saint, and not the full story. It also asks questions, and gives answers on how we need to live our lives more completely. In other words, to live like a saint. I was rather dissapointed with this one."
4,Made me want to have a pint.. and I did.,"Fantastic light read. Finished it in a day, but admittedly, that day was broken in half by a late afternoon trip to the pub. There was so much drinking and smoking going on in this book that I was forced to join in! Not everything good has to be Tolstoy, and Crane's characters make for a delightful diversion."
1,Boring not worth it,"This book is a complete waste of time. I bought it because I thought it was going to be interesting learning how a 26 year old girl changes her life. Instead, is an ongoing storytelling of how she drinks and smokes at every hour of the day. She spends her nights drunk and her mornings hangover.The most stupid thing of all is that she never learns anything. She never matures or appreciates life and people, and her friends are just as boring as she is."
2,Not your best example of chick lit,"I've never written a negative review, and I don't want to be too horrible to this book. There were parts I enjoyed, and I finished the book. But overall, I was disappointed. Partly, I think, because the concept of the story appealed to me. Smart girl in a dead-end job goes to grad school in England. Sounds great, right?Unfortunately, the book never took off. I didn't really click with the characters, the plot wasn't compelling, the love story was half-hearted at best, and what the book mostly seemed about was drinking, getting drunk (very drunk), and recovering from the hangover in time to do it again. I'm no Puritan - I drink, sometimes a little too much - but this was rather appalling.I think that anybody who reads this book and thinks it strikes a chord should probably get themselves to an AA meeting."
1,Horrid.,"I don't like the characters. I don't know as there was a plot. I read many genres, and give up on few books, but I won't get my hour back that I spent reading the first half of this book. It was going nowhere fast, and I didn't give a hoot what happened to any of the characters.Decision: Not worth my time. Thank goodness it's a library book and I didn't spend any money on this worthless use of paper."
2,Perhaps the problem is just misrepresentation...,"As soon as I read the summary of this back, I grabbed it and headed for the checkout. I love books about England, and a book about going to school in England (a dream of mine!)seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately, this book is not about going to school in England, it is about drinking in England. Someone once told me that talking about drinking is the most boring thing in the world, and reading about it is close second. Not only did I find the constant boozing boring, I thought it was sad that a women in her mid-20s could waste an entire year of her life being hungover and experiencing teenage drama. I didn't like any of the characters, and there was no feeling of what studying abroad might be like. I think the problem is that this book presents itself as a student's experiences in a different educational system, but it is just about drinking and smoking--two of the most uninteresting things imaginable."
1,English as a Second Language,"I thought the premise of the book sounded cute, but after 3 attempts and a complete inability to get into the book, I can't recommend it based on my experience. My opinion on any book, however, is most probably as personal as it would be on art or perfume. One cannot base an opinion of a book strictly from a review from a stranger. This is one opinion only!"
3,Left me wanting more depth,"While I did find this book to be an enjoyable read, I thought there was a lot more details about the immature behavior, alcohol, stalker encounters and nicotine than the depth of the characters. I would have liked it more if the author had given us more insight into their past, how it affects their present and just their motivations and/or thoughts in general. I felt like several of them were a lot more immature than would be expected of someone their age, but I guess that does happen. And while I did appreciate the growth that the main character experienced in the end, I was expecting and wanting a bigger growth - more of a catharsis. Overall, it was a fun read and had some funny moments."
2,Disappointed...,"When it comes to chick lit, I am very easy to please. But this book just didn't cut it for me. It was very difficult to remember that the main character, Alex, is a 26 year old woman. The characters were not only immature, but they were also raging nicotine and alcohol addicts, which got old after the first chapter.It's hard to believe that Toby and Alex end up together at the end of the story after all the dumb fights they had. Suzanne was a waste of time and towards the end around the last 5 chapters or so, I only read the dialog. My favorite part of the book is Sean Douglas. If the author writes more, I'd be willing to read them, but my expectations will be very high.ONLY if you are prepared to be disappointed and you have a lot of patience, then I would suggest reading this."
2,not worth the hype...,"I had read so many great reviews of this book that I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I loved Crane's novel Frenemies, and hoped that this book would be just as good.Unfortunately, I was never able to really get into the story. It wasn't so bad that I stopped reading, but it was nothing more than average. I found the tone a bit too detached, and the character development was definitely lacking. It seemed to be little more than a stringing together of drunken shenanigans (that were definitely not laugh out loud funny)."
2,Disappointing,"I incorrectly assumed this book would be funny, with a unique spin. I was wrong. I found 'English as a Second Language' very lacking in plot, with a few cliches thrown in for good measure. You have a token supposed heroine, unsure about life--so she beings anew! There's the seemingly psychotic girl, a couple of hot men, and a lesson to be learned. I found the ending abrupt, and left me unfulfilled. I think there are several better choices out there."
2,Drunk Drunk Drunk,"This book started out promising, and went down hill the moment the main character landed in England. I've spent enough time there to know that the CONSTANT alcohol consumption is a true representation of the culture. However, it doesn't make for interesting characters or plots. Somewhere in a haze of tequila fumes and cigarette smoke the heroine learns some of life's lessons. However, we know from the get-go what they are going to be. Don't engage with psychotic people. Don't only fall in love with unavailable men.It had it's moments and some great lines. Overall, it was a mediocre entry into the fabulous world of Chick Lit."
2,Mediocre at Best,"See title. Mediocre at best. I went into this book, expecting wittiness and a fresh story, and left wishing it was over with already. For an author with a PhD in English Lit, I was very disappointed with her writing. She walked in circles for over 200 pages. Don't bother even reading the summary."
2,it wasn't that great,"I thought this book sounded funny but was I wrong! It could be interesting if the author actually ever got into the story but the whole time I felt like the author was just summarizing every situation which made it completely confusing and boring. Good for a summer read, but nothing beyond that."
2,"eh, not quite","Despite being funny in some parts, it was definitely not worth my $12. There wasn't much plot and the conclusion (wait, was there one?) was far from exciting. As another reviewer said, the main character acts more like an undergrad freshman than a 25 year old woman, and it gets boring to read about bars, cigarettes, and petty catfights over and over. Sorry Crane, try again."
1,Run away. Run away fast.,"This book was pretty much just awful. It didn't hold my interest, I didn't really care for any of the characters and was not at all motivated to see how it all ended. It was not that well written either. I like ""chick lit"" in general and read quite a bit of it... this book is one of the worst I have ever attempted to read from this genre. Don't waste your time. And if you feel compelled to read it, borrow it from a library. Don't waste your money."
3,Poor DVD Quality,"WWE Capitol Punishment is a good show. If you're a WWE fan, you will enjoy it. However, the quality of the dvd is terrible. The show looks like someone downloaded it from the internet. Thankfully Money in the Bank and SummerSlam do not look like this. I recommend if you are a collector."
3,John Cena battles Little Jimmy and a whole host more in this PPV on DVD,"Capitol Punishment took place on June 19, 2011 at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. On the card that night were the following matches:*Kofi Kingston, WWE United States Champion, facing Dolph Zigglerfor the WWE United States Championship*The Miz facing former protege Alex Riley*Alberto Del Rio meeting The Big ShowWade Barrett, WWE Intercontinental Champion, facing off against Ezekiel Jackson for the WWE Intercontinental Championship*CM Punk meeting Rey Mysterio*Randy Orton, World Heavyweight Champion, facing Christian for the World Heavyweight Championship* Evan Bourne meeting Jack Swagger*John Cena, WWE Champion, facing R-Truthfor the WWE ChampionshipAnother fun WWE event with some surprise guests along the way."
4,WWE Capitol Punishment Review,"The CM Punk-Rey Mysterio match was the best on the card and good reminders of Punk's bouts against Samoa Joe from Ring of Honor and Rey's matches against Eddie Guerrero back in WCW. The WWE title bout between John Cena & Ron Killings was desperately disappointing as watching Kevin James's film:Zookeeper. The World title match between Randy Otron & Christian was just as good as thier bout from Over The Limit even with the lame ""foot under the rope"" ending. The rest were ok. I give this event a 8 out of 10."
2,Maby it was just old,"The dvd came promptly but when we tryed to watch disk 2 it froze, completly looseing the first match on disk 2. This was a title match so it was verry disapointing to my son."
1,Does not work with most printers,I was very disappointed with this product. It did not work with either my HP all-in-one printer nor did it work with an Epson R300. The canvas is much to thick and bendable to work with most ink jet printers.
3,Weak Metal Part!,One of the screws on the metal part fell off the 2nd day i got it! Otherwise it was great! :D
3,Not Justin's Best,"This album is not up to par with ""Moving Mountains"" or ""Songwriter,"" but it does have some good songs. ""Troubadour"" is one of Justin's very best songs - if not THE best. Definitely worth having."
2,Justin Hayward - 'View From The Hill' (CMC International),"Looks to be Justin Hayward's most recent of five solo efforts he'd put out.Certainly nothing to write home about.Great for him he's got the Moody Blues to fall back on.Only tunes here I was even somewhat impressed with were ""Broken Dream"" and ""The Way Of The World"".I'd classify the entire 'View From...' disc as soft rock rather than classic rock,for which I'll assume this CD was aimed to be.For serious Moody Blues fanatics,die-hards and completists ONLY."
5,CD View from The Hill-Justin Hayward,One of my absolute favorite CD's. Wonderful songs and his voice was in perfect form. Would recommend it to any Moody Blues lover.
1,old musicain's poor album,"Often we happen to meet old musican's poor outing to the his brilliant younger days. That's it. No energies, no sizzling emotions & no musicianship.This album consists of tedious,tatsteless & very weak vocals plus just so-so playing.I waste my money.."
2,Poor printing quality,"Has a lot of interesting diagrams but some are ilegible (can not read them) cause is black and white all of them, only portrait in color."
1,What's Missing?,"Why weren't there interviews of suburban kids who shared classrooms with the METCO kids? I doubt it would surprise anyone to learn that the METCO kids were disruptive, stole things, and terrorized and bullied other students. Great for race relations, eh?There was one guy who was so bad, I looked him up a few years later to see if he was in jail yet. Turns out he became a drug dealer and got shot and killed. Of course the Boston Globe blamed it on ""easy access to guns."" Haha."
3,book review,Not what I had expected. This is a much simpler book than the original books. I use the book to teach and it is on a lower level that I needed. I will not buy any more of the set.
2,sleeves are way too long and stick out from short sleeved shirt,"These were purchased for a trip, and although the fabric dried quickly as expected, we were very disappointed to find that the long length of the sleeves made it impossible to wear them with a short sleeved shirt! This is just plain bad design."
2,"Great material, odd fit","I purchased a couple of these t shirts for trip but had to return them. I have no doubt the material is excellent (I own some of their boxer briefs) when it comes to wicking moisture, but the fit was really weird. I'm 6' with a slender build and found the sleeves to be really long while the length was way too short. There's no way it would stay tucked in as an undershirt, so I returned them. Perhaps, a large would have been better lengthwise but the sleeves would have fit like a 3/4 sleeve baseball jersey. I like retro but not that much..haha."
4,"So far, so good","Bought them for an upcoming Alaska adventure, to avoid packing too much. Haven't tried the drying out process yet, but they are a nice material and fit well. Have a couple pair of the boxer-shorts, and like the fit as well, and drying was fine. I suspect these will work just fine as well."
2,Length Too Short,"I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts. I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively. I am a perfect medium size and 5' 10"" tall. While the width around the torso is fine, the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line. I should have studied the catalog photo more closely, you can see for yourself, the proportion indicates a shorter length."
2,"It's an okay product, but I was hoping for more.","I'm not as pleased with these as I was pleased with the boxer briefs of the same brand. These aren't wearing as well, and they don't seem as tough. After purchasing the underwear, I purchased more of them. I will not be purchasing more of the t-shirts."
5,Just watch out for snags and the dryer,"It snags easily, and the dryer can be death. Hang dry and don't wear near pointy things. Other than that it is cool, dry, and a dream for traveling. Wash in the sink, hang dry overnight (or put on, which makes it dry really fast) and go."
1,Collar frays immediately,"I love this company's products, but the collar on this shirt frayed immediately. I don't know if it's because of contact with razor stubble or a beaded necklace, but it didn't hold up at all and immediately began fraying. That was a surprise given how wonderful their other products have been. Wouldn't purchase again."
2,Like it except...,"Great t-shirt except it balls up and has wear issues. The material is great. I could almost overlook the weird wear issues except it's very expensive. I like plain black t-shirts and this one became my favorite for about two weeks. Then it started to look worn out around the waist area, balling up and looking generally unkempt. If it kept it's condition I would buy about 30 of these, one for each day of the month. Maybe there is another black t that will get into 'exclusive black t' territory."
1,"Over priced, small sized and not worth it!","I wear a size large and ordered that size. I could barely get the shirt on. I wear a size 42 sport coat, so I'm not a big person, but this was sad. It was also over priced for the quality. Seems like Ex Officio needs to start making quality gear again."
2,NOT Odor Resistant,"The product description states, ""this tee is odor resistant"". Not true. First time I wore it as an undershirt, I sweat a little bit and I could smell it through my dress shirt. It's very comfortable though but not worth $31."
1,Neck pills after 5 wearings.,"I am really disappointed in the Tee from ExOfficio. The boxers are amazing, comfortable and seem to be durable. The Tee shirt pilled around the neck after only 5 wearings. I have purchased 2 and am returning them to Amazon. For the cost, they should be better quality."
1,Wouldn't get another shirt like it,"Pros:-Absorbs sweat-Dries *kinda* fastCons:-Gets ruined easily; backpack straps, anything velcro, they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.-Though it absorbs sweat, that sweat SHOWS-Doesn't look good. Definitely not a shirt you can wear out. (IMHO)Definitely wouldn't buy a shirt with this material again."
4,Great tee!,"This shirt does exactly what is advertised. I play golf and work in the golf industry. Often I travel and need many undershirts. I tried this tee when I went to Sandestin, Florida recently where the humidity was awful. This tee kept me dry all day and at the end of the day I washed it in the sink and it was ready to go the next morning. I was impressed. Only the sizing was off - I bought a small based not on the information provided, but rather based on the fact that I tried one on at a local store. I wear Medium in everything, but small was just about too big for me. Sleeves were a little long, but ok. Highly recommend it."
4,16 days 2 t-shirts!,This T-shirt was great for a 16 day business trip I took to 3 different countries. Because of difficult connections I had to carry-on my luggage. I brought 2 Ex Officio T's and 2 boxers for the entire trip. They dry very quickly after you wash them in the hotel room and they are quite comfortable. The only issue I had with them is that they are not as breathable as cotton. So they can be a bit warm under the covers if you also use them to sleep in.
5,Great undershirt!,Expensive but worth it. Shirt is very comfortable. It is easy to wash by hand and dries very fast. I purchased 2 shirts to take on a trip to Switzerland but like it so much I want to wear it everyday.
4,Comfortable travel undershirt.,"Performs as advertised. Great comfort but wrinkles easily - perhaps best as a base layer, not as a warm weather top."
5,Insightful and emotional,"As a student of pain management I found this book offered easy-to-understand examples, and appraoched the topic of pain very holistically by also focusing on nutritional aspects as well. One thing that that I have learned from my clients is that pain is not just physiology, but is instead an emotional experience. This book highlights that point, where many other books take it for granted. Personal interviews of people that deal with pain in their lives adds a personal touch. Clear cut drawings (that were expertly drawn) offered helpful exercises and stretches for common areas of pain. Overall, I would certainly recommend it and I'm glad its in my library."
5,Carpal Tunnel? Don't even think of surgery - Read this book,"I have one of those jobs that require long hours in front of a computer, clicking away on a keyboard and a mouse. It wasn't long before I experienced sharp pains throughout my forearms and wrists that made work painful and even interrupted my sleep. Like many, I thought I was developing carpal tunnel. To my surprise, surgery was far from what I needed. I needed Chapter 6 of Where It Hurts and Why (Pain in the Arm, Wrist and Hand)!! After doing the recommended stretches twice a day for one week (only one week!) my pain disappeared. In this digital age I know there are others out there experiencing wrist pain from this type of work. I recommend highly this book to alleviate the pain using simple and effective stretching and strengthening techniques."
4,One of the Better War Films,"The Brotherhood of war is about two brothers that get caught up in the Korean War. They face the had tasks of defending there country in a war they don't understand. The battle scenes are intense and realistic on par with Saving Private Ryan. But what is best is the character moments, seeing what they go through and how there country was torn apart from both sides."
5,Bond of brotherhood,"This is probably one of my favorite films. Don't really want to say much about the actual plot but it is about two brothers and their bond durning war time. The changes and scarifies that were made, and not just by them. It takes place durning the Korean War, when the DPRK invaded the ROK. Visually can be almost compared to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but there is a different sense of emotion and how they express it. Make the decision for yourself, pick it up. Highly recommend this film."
4,Greatest Depiction of the Korean War,"This was by far the greatest depiction of the Korean War ever made; from the viewpoint of the Korean people this movie ranks with Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Windtalkers. Spectacular visual and special effects, this movie is brutal; a roller coaster ride of extreme emotion. This is the story of two brothers forced to fight, ill prepared for the horrors of war. A tragic plot twist turns this movie on its head with a final savage battle, one of the best ever filmed, followed by a gripping ending. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loved Saving Private Ryan. Some of the supporting characters had less than desirable dialogue; however, this movie is a must to see.-Kevin82abn"
5,wow,Saving Private Ryan in Korea. When this one slows down use the time to take a breath--you'll need it!
5,Fantastic,"Excellent movie that shows the real horrors and strained relationships of war. Fantastic acting and great story, would watch it again!"
2,"too gory, blood & guts,","I do not have a tollerance for this much blood, guts and tragety. It could be an excellent story, but I could not watch the blood & guts. I this 20 words yet."
4,A melodrama with the war as background,"Contains minor spoiler.It is a meticulously made movie, the battle scenes were well done; the actors did a decent job. I wanted to be moved by it, but was left detached emotionally. The plot wove so many twists and turns in the characters' fate, that it bordered on manipulation. I found it implausible that the older brother switched sides so easily, was't the North wary of spies as much as the South?It is not a shoot'em up, good guy vs. bad guy war movie, neither is it an anti-war movie in the strictest sense. It feels like a melodrama set to a war background."
2,unremarkable and at times slightly absurd,"This isn't a review of the entire movie - just the first 45 minutes or so. That was my limit for this (almost) comically earnest tale of brotherly love and heroism. For those who suggest that there's no such thing as overacting in Korea, please.Interested in much better acted (and more intelligent) somewhat recent Korean films? Try Chunhyang (2000), or The Host (2006)."
3,"Not as good as Saving Private Ryan, but a nice try.","I had great expectations for this film and although it was a nice try it can not be compared with Spielberg's masterpiece. The film is full of action and is very realistic from the point of costumes and weapons used but the battles are pictured like a hailstorm of violence where nobody can see a thing. The story is good with a little over-reacting in some cases. It is really unbelievable that new directors have learned nothing from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and have not attempted to use the same tricks and effects which were very simple but genious."
3,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm,"Well, for those of you do not know what Tae Guk Gi means, it is basically the name for the South Korean flag. Its stupid how they had to change the title to the brotherhood of war. Anyways, this movie is alrite, its not that great. With the innaccuracy, this movie doesnt present a good movie, but the overwhelming drama, its kind of makes up for the inaccuracy of the movie. Along with Jang dong goon, and Won bin, this movie is alrite and i did enjoy some parts of the movie. Other then that, the ending quite reminds me of SPR (Saving private Ryan). By the way, next time you watch a korean movie about the past times, please notice the accuracy of the movie based on history. This movie wasnt made for history, but purely for entertainment. plus, when people get shot in this movie, they tend to move that if they were cazy or if there in a shock then they fall down, still moving crazy."
1,A pretentious film for suckers.,"This is possibly one of the cheapest knockoffs of ""Saving Private Ryan."" It copies what Spielberg perfected, but takes it to another level that it becomes completely pretentious and fake. The shaky camera movement during the battle scenes do not feel genuine. Instead, the director enhances it as if to suggest that Spielberg's war was not real or brutal enough. This is possibly one of the worst war films I have ever seen."
3,NOT A GREEN MONKEY,"I WAS HOPING FOR THE GREEN MONKEY AS PICTURED, BUT RECEIVED ANOTHER ""ANIMAL"" INSTEAD. MY DOGGIES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED."
3,Cute but not worth it-,"I thought the Tooth Tunes would be such a great idea, it was cut for a one time buy but I won't buy them again. The bristles very quickly become worn and it needs a new head, the problem is that you can not change the head on these. The 2 minute brshing rule is so important but once they figure out how the music starts they can just use it to listen to the music and you've lost the whole purpose behine them. Lastly there is no way to change the battery when it dies. We are going back to a battery operated tooth brush that the heads and batteries can be changed and using a small timer that they can operate."
2,Not worth the price!,"My kids really wanted the tooth tunes brush. When I saw the price of one I thought it was too expensive but then I found a good deal and bought three. I should have paid more attention to the packaging before I purchased it or I would not have. You cannot replace the brush head or the batteries!!! That is absolutely ridiculous, any powered toothbrush I have ever owned (even ones that retail for less than tooth tunes) has a replaceable brush head and batteries. Because of this I think this product is VERY OVERLY PRICED and would not recommend anyone buying one."
1,Enzo Women's Helenie Buckle Loafer,"These shoes are beautiful, but tight and flip flop off your feet. It looks like the designers are not taking into account for the arches of the foot. It's not just this designer but most of the shoes out there. So, from now on I will not buy shoes online. I will be trying shoes on and not waste anymore money."
4,Delicious memoir by a Delightful LEGEND!,"This chatty, funny book is just the tonic for those who find little to admire in today's wasteland of celebrities. This lady has been there and done it all, and lived to tell the tale. This book would make a wonderful basis for a one-woman Broadway show, which is HOPEFULLY in the works. The Channing that emerges in this book is a warm, witty celebrant of life who has worked for decades and even managed to find true love, at long last. A book for everyone who loves the theatre."
1,Scatter Brained,"With all due respect to Ms. Channing, I found this book to be rather scatter brained. She changes subjects in mid-sentence!It's also written for an industry insider. She drops the names of producers, set designers and costumers as if they are the big stars. There was one good bit at the end of the book where she talks about Ethel Mermann...but that's not enough. I read a LOT of entertainment biographies and was really looking forward to this one...but I can NOT recommend it."
1,Yawn,"I like autobiographies. I like Broadway. They are two of my favorites. So you'd think this would be a home run. But...It is probably the worst autiobiography - no, the worst book - I've read in years. It is so poorly edited - rambling stories - most of the interesting people she mentions, she does so in the third person ""I hear Judy Garland liked pink too.""A complete waste of time - Miss Channing has had a completely unique life - it's too bad she chose not to write about it here."
1,Save Your Money,"Once again, I've wasted my money on a totally unreadable book. It's not just that she flits from one subject to another within the space of a sentence, but a lot of them are not even sentences. I can't make sense of it. Not interesting at all."
2,A STORY ABOUT AN EARTH ANGEL,"This is the first autobiography I have read where a person's life has/had no bumps whatsoever. No hurdles, no challenges where everything happened perfectly and all persons she met were also perfect, wonderful, completely talented, and complimented her repeatedly. Oh me, 'twas quite sickening. Carol Channing is a talented, unique individual but an author she is not."
2,Denial is a River in Egypt,"Carol Channing's memoir is not candid at all. This is the story of a lady that spent 40+ years on the road doing tour after tour after tour because she was in a loveless unhappy marriage. Her abusive husband was living high off the hog with his male lover while she was out performing all over America. She had a terrible life until her husband's death...and only recently she met her current husband, a wonderful loving millionnaire whom she dated originally in Junior high. It's a fascinating story which you will not find in the book."
1,"This Edition, sold by Amazon LLC, is shoddy!","I wish I'd known that the book I was paying 14.95 for was a poorly reproduced knock-off of the original edition. The cover art is out of focus, and the internal photos all look like they were run through a bad photocopier. Amazon LLC doesn't let you leave ""feedback for the seller,"" so I urge buyers to proceed with caution when ordering their products. The options I'm able to find online are a)return the book or b)track the shipment. How about an option like ""complain that the book isn't worth 14.95, and ask that I be credited ten dollars."" Caveat Emptor."
5,Happy Birthday,"I told a dear friend about how pretty I thought these earrings were in a conversation with no real intention, she then asked if it was a ""hint"" about my birthday? I jokingly said it hadn't started that way but it was now :) then forgetting about the conversation i was very pleasantly surprised a few weeks later when I got these earrings they are very pretty and a good size they are not too big. I love them :)"
3,Goat's Milk,"Brand ( a dour, put-upon, hen pecked performance by Alex Van Warmerdam) is a kept husband who on top of his other failings, can neither read nor write. His demanding and successful wife Keets ( Annet Malherbe: portly of body and pushy of disposition) decides to hire Brand a tutor, Lena to teach him how to read and write. But witnessing the bonding of Lena and her husband, Keets projects into the future and sees babies: something that Keets cannot produce. And this is where the trouble begins.Director Alex Van Warmerdam has very little on his mind here but to show us the quirkiness of the situation of the triangle of his characters, the wholesomeness of goat's milk and the green pastures of the Netherlands.""Little Tony"" is a slight film: one more of situation and character than of anything having to do with the social or moral. As such, it is a minor success: quaint, humorous and profoundly anti-establishment."
5,Goddesses Don't Buy Green Bananas,"I bought this book for a friend waging war on her cancer. This book is inspirational. It will make you laugh, cry, smile, nod your head in agreement, encourage you to share it with someone special, & touch your heart. The photographs are so WONDERFUL!!! Lesley Daley did a wonderful job with both her words & photographs. A gift that will be treasured."
5,Inspirational!,"I received Lesley's book while I was going through treament for inflammatory breast cancer, I was 26 at diagnosis so needless to say I was going through a lot of emotions. I cant begin to describe how much this book helped me. It made me feel like I wasn't alone in my fight. Although each person has a different story the bottom line is the same, and Lesley's presentation of each person was amazing! The photos are a source of strentgth and the stories are inspirational!"
5,a doom metal masterpiece!,"classic doom with awesome heavy guitars and an original operatic style vocalist.Messiahs vocals are amazing.the guitar solos are incredible.some softer passages at times only enhance the listening experience.production A-1.the artwork fits the title of the CD perfectly.can listen to, start to finish.the demo versions on the bonus disc are OK,but this is still a great buy.I loaned this out years ago and never got it back,I am glad I repurchased it.I would also recommend Epicus,Doomicus,Metallicus and Nightfall by Candlemass.Rock On!"
1,"Return Request sent 23 days back, item still not picked from home !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",This item is not suitable for VAN. so I sent return request 23 days but still it is not picked from home...Big box waiting at home is very inconvenient.. please arrange for pick up
3,Wrong choice,"This was a wrong choice on my part, as the Customer Service Rep told me it was more ""clarifying"". I wanted something to use on occasion between Wen which is a great product but at times i wanted to use a ""regular"" shampoo in between to save money - but the difference in the way my hair felt was awful. It makes me sure that i want to use only the Wen and pay the price - but if you need a product for oily hair this one would be good - Just not for my fine, color treated hair - So i will use it as a bubbly bath - The scent is pleasant any way"
5,Excellent,Feels great in the shower! Goes on easy and is an overall excellent product for anyone interested in a great smelling shower gel.
2,Not for me,Lots of people rave about this brand and so I decided to give it a shot. It's said to be a shampoo/shower gel/bubble bath and the big test for me is to try it on my hair. I found it really ineffective and heavy and it left my hair oily. I wasn't up for using it as a shower gel or bubble bath after it did that to my hair. Maybe a different product would have better suit me.
1,very faint smell,i can barely smell the coconut...its great for someone with allergies probably who cant handle a stronger smell but for me its just ok...does lather nicely though.
3,Of the Harvard poets...,"Perhaps the constant praise of Rich is a bit silly, but she really does take exception to all that is objectionable in contemporary America. This is, of course, a threat to some, but I enjoyed reading this book for the most part. As a lyric poet, Rich is undeniably mediocre, and the usual comparisons that she and her adulating collegiate readers make between her and Emily Dickinson is offensive and ridiculous. However, she speaks her mind, and is an important voice in Lesbian poetry, particularly love poems. If she can't compare in poet greatness with other lesbian poets like Elizabeth Bishop, and can't hold a wet match next to HD, this is not to be regretted. Rich is an unusual poet, one who is determined to write political poetry, even when a different writer might perhaps know better."
5,An Incredible Read,"Okay, if you read the back of the manga, you will think its about four kids who want to blow up there highschool. If you think this is a disgraceful plot, then you may miss one of the worlds greatest mangas. In reality its about four people, all with problems that make them hate there lives. They meet up in a chat room and decide that the center of their worries is the highschool they all attend (one person turns out to be a teacher). The day the plan to blow it up is X-day. The story is not so much about getting X-day to happens as it is seeing four characters with nothing their lives come toghether and seeing love and freindship blossom. Realizing that they have other people out there that feel their pain, and that maybe after all, they do have a true friend in the world. In a way, its kind of beautiful."
5,OMGosh THIS IS SO AWESOME,"Okay, if you love playing Playstation ... and you can't get ENOUGH of it and want to play it EVERYWHERE like, in a car, in your bed, somewhere OTHER than the T.V. this is what you need. It is THE coolest thing ever! It's so easy to attach, and easy to hook up to turn on! The colors are awesome and it's VERY clear. I highly recommened it. If you are interested, but not sure, i ASSURE you. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT! It is so awesome. :-) Take it from the pro lol."
5,My round model is not bad,"First off, everyone that has a PSone must gett this screen. Sure it is a bit pricey, but it is worth it. The picture is clean and sharp. This screen makes the games look a ton better.I got the round screen. A lot of people are complaining about it. My friend got the Square one, so we compared. They were identical in picture. The round ones sound is a little worse.Anyway, buy this screen, I don't even use my big TV anymore. If you don't have a PSone, go get one then buy the screen, that is how cool it is. I can't play it in the car for more than about 10 minutes at a time cause I get car sick if I play it any longer. I got the battery pack and played it on the airplane and at school, it is so cool.BUY IT!!"
3,Not That Great,"For just a screen to use with portable devices it's OK. It's not great if you are trying to use it to make a portable system from scratch. The official PS One screen is the only way to go in that regard. Only found this out after opening up, which made it garbage."
1,Garbage,"This shows what hype all this has become. SCRATCHING is beautiful but this movie sucks. It is a live performance w nothing new. No tricks, jazzy is using a laptop. Mixmaster mike bites z-trips routine. and the x-cutioners show off that they can do a whole lot of noise and make everything sound wack.Final rating WACK AS HELL. save your money for your groceries or for porn."
1,IT [stinks],"1st off, if your into karate/stunt/gangsta/westside movies, this one is for you. Everyone else, to spare you the horrific 2 hours of this film ill tell you why not to even glance at it in a movie store. My freind and i bought this movie cuz it looked like a good south central/ compton or whatever movie. We expected a Menace 2 Society or Boyz in the Hood, and we got a ""Bruce Lee Visits The South Side"" joint. There are 2 main sound effects in the entirety of the movie, they are ""Ka"" and ""Pow"". There are also about 3 words said in this movie that have more than 1 syllable. Not counting the must-have 4 letter words. The whole plot comes down to 2 guys beatin the nuts out of each other in a strange gang/cult's hideout, and of course, the main character, Boo saves the day. So if you want to rent this movie, do it for laughs. If you dont want to rent this movie, good."
2,2 stars ONLY because it was funny,"Ok so tonight I go to visit my friends and they happen to be watching this movie. At first it seemed alright, the beginning is probably the BEST part of the entire movie, then you start noticing things. Like the timing is off [meaning the sound does not match the action/speech of the film] and seeing that they used a Kung-Fu based plot I guess that could of been on purpose. Anyway as mentioned in almost all of the other reviews the acting is HORRIBLE. The plot is questionable, I think they had a good idea they just didn't take enough time to complete the thought. Anyway the film will make you laugh, I seriously think that ""Thug Life"" is the worst title this movie could have, it is more of a parody if you ask me, but anyway it is worth a watch at least for some laughs."
3,I WAS IN THIS MOVIE,"Watching this film brought back great memories of visiting the set and eventually being selected as an extra in this film. It was made during the summer of 2000 here in Houston. I knew some of the cast and crew members and just happened to visit them the night of the shoot when they told me about some film being made. Anyway, it was this film. I also didn't realize that I was in the same film with Napoleon (a member of the legendary 2Pac Outlaws group). My high school classmate choreographed the kung fu moves and had a small cameo in the film as well. I thought the acting was cool. I did learn a lot of things while on the set.As for the movie, itself: after watching it, I thought that the acting could have used a little more work. But, the film was still watchable and enjoyable. I still watch it to this day and memories start flowing through my mind. Give this film a try. You might like it. I certainly enjoyed being a part of it as well as liked it when I watched it."
3,Thug Life (or is it?),"Well, I bought this movie for the simple fact that it had ""THUG LIFE"" on the front of the box. I didn't read the back of the box or anything I just got it cuz it said ""Thug Life."" Well, I watched the movie and I think that it's alright, it don't live up to Thug Life movies like Boyz in tha Hood or Menace II Society but it's alright. I recommend you rent this movie first and you decide to buy it."
4,Thug life,it was an alright movie.I liked it because it took place in my hometown which is houston and its representing that shut em down records and thats my familys buisness
2,less helpful,"this book has no answer key and needs to be accompanied with the answer key, which is sold separately. the explanations on some of the grammar exercises are a little lacking as well."
3,seen better dog training books,"I have been reading a lot of dog training books and compiling the different methods to see what will work best for my 3 dogs. overall the things in this book are great ideas. The only thing I see to be the real problem is the way it is written, it isn't easy to use and is extremely wordy. I think that the Liz Palika Guide to raising a puppy is much better. You get the same training methods and commands but you also get a guide to use if your puppy gets sick, help with grooming, housetraining, bonding, you name it. Its overall a much better book."
1,Works great for the first 20 minutes,"As implied from the title, after 20 minutes the cassette player stopped working. Playing on its own behalf, it decided to switch sides every 30 seconds and eject itself rendering music unplayable. Also, the sound is centered on the left side. Though I can re-balance my stereo on my car for it to even out, I should not HAVE to do this if the cassette player works properly.But that's just the item itself.The customer service I received was less than perfect to.After submitting a complaint to Satellite Radio, they emailed me informing me to call them. After I did, I received a very nice message that my order was NOT in their systems, even though I clearly ordered it through Amazon.Therefore, my recommendation is to buy another product, as I have heard from friend that their Cassette players do not break down after 20 minutes of usage. It might only be $4, but you get what you pay for as I have learned."
1,"Worked great for two weeks, then failed","This adapter worked as expected for two weeks, then went kaput during a long road trip (the adapter would make a high-pitched whine during playback). Would not recommend."
3,You get what you pay for,"I'm not a hard core audiophile but sound quality is pretty big for me. This converter does not in anyway do justice to the music I put through it or my car stereo system.Nonethless if you mess around with the sound levels, you can get tolerable sound out of it. If you turn down the volume to midway or below on your mp3 device, it minimizes the data being processed by the cassette converter, and therefore ups your sound quality. The catch is you have to pump up the volume on the volume on your car stereo so if you accidentally switch to FM you're in for a slight jolt.Without this minor tinkering you will get flat sound and static mush, esp with anything borderline rock.If you are a serious audiophile, do not even consider this.But if you are a mild audiophile with a limited budget or not an audiophile at all then this is a good temporary solution (with some tinkering).1.99 is a steal, don't expect greatness from it."
4,Good value,"Works great. Full ipod library in a cassette deck for the older car, more secure (take the ipod out when you get out) and much cheaper than putting in a new cd player with mp3 capacity (or trying to dig out old boxes of cassettes)."
5,Great Product,"Excellent, does exactly what I expected. I would recommend this to anyone with an mp3 player and a tape deck. Great sound!"
1,cheaply made,Broke in about 2 weeks. the wire is very chinsy. sond quality was poor at best. I would recondite a different brand
2,Not as described,"The item I received isn't what was described. Item I purchased was supposed to be a white Jensen product that I reviewed on other websites ahead of time as being a great product. What I got was a black knock-off, no-name product that doesn't even work on one side. Didn't pay enough to deal with returning it. Just buyer beware that what you get isn't what you're purchasing."
2,Ok if you can ignore the clicking sound,"I ordered this device so I could listen to music on my IPod or IPhone in the car. I had similar device that worked very well a few years ago, but it broke so this was my attempt at replacement. The device works BUT if the volume is not turned up very high, you hear a constant clicking sound coming from the cassette. It's ok if you can drown it out with very loud music or busy conversation, but if that's not the case it's pretty annoying and makes the device basically unusable. I would not recommend it."
5,Great item for the price,"This is a wonderful way to cheapy play your ipod touch or other plugin devices in an older model car w/out spending much money. Sound quality is good, and since all you do is pop in the cassette there is no assembly or work required. Obviously it is not going to produce the same output as an installed device, but for the casual listener it is a perfect inexpensive solution!"
4,Great Deal,"I have only had it for a short time, but it seems to work quite well, and for a great price."
3,Works ok.,"Product works okay.Do not expect high quality for the money you spend.You must have the volume on your mp3 player at the max.Then you will end up having to increase the volume on your car system in order to get decent volume on your mp3 player.Also, there is a slight hiss you can hear in the background.But the product does work fine for decent listening.Over all. I spent little got what I paid for."
2,The Bass is Too Damn High!,"Using this product, the bass was WAY too high, completely washed out everything else until I set my iPod to ""Bass Reduce"" mode, which solved the problem, but creates the whole new problem of having the EQ set to something I don't want it to be set to."
5,Much better than my last cassette adapter!,This adapter provides great sound quality and almost never tries to switch sides automatically like some of the others do.!
5,Genuinely Surprised,"Okay, okay, I finally broke down and bought a MP3 player and I was shocked. This thing produced amazing music. I started thinking that it would be great to use it in the car but, alas, I only have a 2001 Civic LX with a factory stereo. (Although I have installed Polk speakers all around.) I happened to notice this CHEAP gadget on Amason.com and figured I'd give it a try. Imagine my amazement when I found that THIS CHEAP LITTLE GADGET WORKS! As a matter of fact, it works great. It produces music much, much better than I thought it ever would. I read several reviews that said that they had a slight problem with hiss (sounding like tape hiss) but I could never get it to hiss at any volume level. I did't have any problem with the auto reverse like some other products seem to have. I can't find anything wrong with this. Give it a try - you'll like it. How can you go wrong for the price?"
1,Poor,"They sent me the wrong item ... and its terrible.. lot of noise, the wire is too thin, the stereo point is not good enough. All in all a bad deal for whatever you spend on it. ..end of story!"
1,"Did not work, it did not even sound in my car","As soon as I received the product, I put the cassette on my car, I tryed everything I could but it did not even work, but what can I expect of paying so little on a cassette player, I guess it was more worthy for me to buy the ""Monster"" cassette at $25 at the store and plays excellent!"
4,Inexpensive audio adapter,"My car has a cassette player installed so this was an inexpensive way for me to connect my iPhone to the car audio system. I felt that an FM adapter offered potential problems and cost a lot more. Since I'm not an audiophile the inexpensive option sounds like a good solution, and it is."
3,The bass is way off,Overall the product is great and works and plays my music. Doesnt skip or any of that. BUT the bass is awful!! I tried to turn the bass off but it makes no difference. There is a constant buzzing. At first I thought I blew a speaker but the radio is fine so it is only when i connect my ipod using the cassette that the sound is messed up.
1,Poor quality,You get what you paid for in this product. The sound is very noisy and quiet. Plus there is a constant clicking sound. Don't buy from these guys.
1,Low Audio Quality,"I did not receive the item as it was pictured. The one received was a generic brand. Audio had a lot of static, especially at louder sound levels. It did work, but was unusable. I threw this out because it was worthless to me. Spend the extra money and avoid this item."
2,Not great...,"At first, this product was working great. It sounded very clear and did not get stuck in our Jeep's cassette player. But about 3 months into our purchase, when we used this product, the sound was just awful. We thought our speakers were blown because the sound quality was terrible. Then we realized it was not the speakers, it was only when we used this product.So it lasted for about 3 months, after that it sucked."
3,Not horrible,"The book looked really good when I saw it in the christmas section of Barnes and Noble, so I got it and was really excited about reading it. It was kind hoaky at the beginning, but the story got better. The sex scenes made the hair on my arms stick up, I personally did not care for them. And it said the word ""hon or honey"" way too much for me. I guess I will stay with the fiction section instead of romance. :)"
4,My first Godard,"I must confess, this is, so far, my own exposure to Jean-Luc Godard (hey, the local Blockbuster doens't have ""Breathless!""), so I can't really compare or contrast this film to any of his others.But I did enjoy this film very much. I like the story, love the cinematography (did I spell that right?), and what's not to love about the Madison scene? My only complaint is the blatent b-movie and pulp novel references (did the narrator really have to say things like ""This is the part where we learn what the characters are feeling?""). Perhaps that's the whole point of the film, but I personally think the film would be just as good without them.But other than that, I say go see this movie...and bring me back ""Breathless"" while your at it."
4,"diverting for sure, great moments","Interesting that this film should have a scene where Romeo and Juliet is discussed; the phrase ""newly dead,"" referring to Juliet (I think) stuck out, as lines here and there do with all Shakespeare. And soon enough one of these characters will be newly dead. (The reviewer wrote: ""buoyantly unpredictable in its sense of romantic doom,"" and he's right.) And there are moments in this film that also stand out like great Shakespeare lines; the classroom scene, driving in the car, and, most especially, the dance scene, which is absolutely worth the price of admission. Perhaps the one scene that most typifies, and embodies, New Wave cinema."
4,The Cat Ate My Gymsuit ( a Parent's perspective),"I decided to read this book along with my third grader (it was on her list of reading material rated for third grade reading). She and i both liked the book ok. I felt that the material was too advanced for a third grader to grasp. There were so many life lessons in this book. It will be better understood perhaps by middle school students or perhaps high school students. I had no appreciation for the lead character (Marcy) always putting herself down. She was way too introspective of her shortcomings. And because her Mother was weak in character, she could not help Marcy see the beauty in herself. It seemed morbid at times the way that this storyline keyed in on Marcy's insecurities. I understand the time that this book was penned (1978). Things were different for some women. I remember women being strong and working towards their independence. In 2006, this book would be counterproductive for young and older women."
4,great reading for the age group,i remeber reading this book when i was in junior high. i loved it then and i still love it. my kid is almost old enough to read it and i will encourge it. i had the opportunity to meet ms. danziger when she came to my school and i still have the autographed copy. if you are looking for a good book for kids i recommend this one. i still love the part when her younger sister stuffs oranges into her teddy bear. that always cracks me up.
3,Nice story but not for elementary school.,"My son brought this book home from school the other day and I decided to read it to be able to discuss it with him. The school has it listed as a 4th grade book but it contains references to things I felt were not appropriate for younger kids. I don't want to bring my son up in a bubble but mentioning X-rated movies, underage beer drinking being better than drug use, and then Marcy Lewis thoughts of not being a sex fiend after only getting a kiss on the forehead, seem too much for elementary school. The story was a good one overall and my son seems to be enjoying it but I was surprised at the ending. A good book for middle school kids."
4,The funnist book ever,"This book is the coolest book I have ever read, it is exciting,funny. If you like cats you will love this book. Little minds will love it."
3,Hard To Believe It's Been 38 years,"I sort of get where the appeal is here. I get it that the idea is for the reader to identify with the heroine's ""teen angst"", but everything is so mild there's not much there, there. There's also not a lot of insight and the character development is pretty predictable, so I'm not persuaded that a reader will get much from the book apart from the thrill of recognition. That may just be that what was borderline outrageous in 1974 isn't quite so shocking and upsetting now, or that we don't value earnestness as much now as we used to.That said, sometimes validation and the encouragement that you are not alone is what a teen reader needs and wants, and is enough. So, I sort of think of this as a ""problem"" novel, where the problems are pretty mild. And, I certainly think there is room for teen problem novels where the problems don't include vampires and werewolves, and the book never once describes a pair of shoes by brand name.."
3,wow,it was a all over good book i thought. it seemed very appropriate for the age group that it is for. yes i for sure would reccomend it to other people.
4,Just a good book.,"This book had believable characters, and a good, sort of open-ended resolution (like what might happen in real life.) Some of the unhappy scenes are painfully accurate, and you can be glad for Marcy when something goes right."
3,"The Blimp -- a review by Hope, age 9","This book is about Marcie Lewis. Her father yells constantly! She thinks of herself as a blimp -- Marcie, the blimp. She always is forgetting her gymsuit on purpose and making up a silly excuse. Marcie is an overweight teenager. That is all she is, until Ms. Finney is her English teacher and her life begins to change right before her eyes!It was a little slow at the beginning, but pretty good in the middle, with confusion about Ms. Finney and Mr. Stone's suspicions. But the ending didn't make sense. It wasn't a happy ending but it wasn't a sad ending either, and just made me wonder what happens next. It was almost as if it was a cliffhanger, but no sequel. I think this is an interesting book with a strange finish."
5,The Cat Ate My Gymsuit,"So here I am writing a review of a book that I purloined from my 7th grade english class(27 years ago). Over the years, I have reread this great book about a zillion times. I mean... how can you not connect with a teen who feels out of place with her peers, is worried about boys liking her, will do anything to hide her acne, has dysfunctional parents and a brother who stuffs orange pits into his teddy bear? When I was 13, I thought that someone had written a book about my life (let's hear it for a book that features a plus size teen). I read this book and knew that I was not alone in my fears and concerns. Today, as a mom of 2 preteens, I am instantly put back in touch with the feelings my own daughters are experiencing as they set off into the jungle that is Junior High. This book has something to offer to parents and kids alike. I hope that my resounding reccomendation of this book will be sufficient pennance for that act 27 years ago. Sorry Mrs. Kastens!"
3,The Cat ate my gymsuit,"The Cat ate my gymsuit was definitely not the best book I've ever read, but if you want a fun read, check this book out. The book describes Marcy, a 13-year-old teenage girl, as she copes with her weight and the banning of one of her favorite teachers from her school. After reading about all the problems this girl has at home and with her self-confidence, it makes you almost frustrated and annoyed with the book. Overall, I'd say this book is okay, and definitely for kids below the age of 14."
2,Sorry but I was expecting more....,"I read this book with great excitement, since I'd read there'sa bat in bunk 5, and I'd heard great stories about the book. But a CatAte My Gymsuit didn't live up to the high expectations. I reccommend Edward Bloor By The Way!"
3,"A fun read, but a little too fluffy and schmaltzy for me.","I love to devour a nice, light mystery or romance novel. ""Something's Cooking"" was certainly light, romantic, and mysterious, but it was a little too fluffy, even for me.Angie is just too fictionally, stereotypically perfect. She's stunningly glamourous, perfect in face and figure, senstive, a great cook, an accomplished writer, and rich, to boot. Her only flaws -- she's spunky and stubborn (and when have those ever turned out to be flaws in a romance novel?).Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the book (I liked Paavo -- he was much more real than Angie), but it wasn't my style. When I want a mystery, I want a mystery; when I want a romance, I want a romance. I don't mind a little emotion in a mystery or a little grit in a romance, but I thought this book paid too much attention to the romantic/emotional parts of the story."
2,Disappointment,"The series starts out with an interesting mystery and characters that switch around the usual typecasts- this time the heroine is the rich one (though not self-made- she's more an heiress) and the hunky love interest is the cop with a dark past. [....] Having a somewhat ditzy woman to lighten up a loner guy could work... [...]For this book though, Angie is still tolerable. If you're looking for anything culinary from the series, look somewhere else- its something Angie only dabbles in."
3,snausages,Dog had to develop a taste for them. But now he likes them pretty well. This dog is a picky eater.
4,It works well,"Since Neutrogena pulled their salicylic gel (large tube of blue gel) off the market, this is the next best thing. Although the tube is small, there is enough product there to see results. I'm giving it only 4 stars because the product this replaces was triple the size and half the price."
4,Goodies!,"I bought the album yesterday and really liked it. I agree that she doesn't display a lot of vocal power, but she still has a nice singing voice and the beats are hot. I was not disappointed. I like all but maybe 1 song off of the CD which is good. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes ""Goodies"". The second track w/Missy and the one written by R. Kelly are really good, too."
3,Not bad at all,"It's nice, The Title cut is my fav and ooh baby. The Missy Joint is hot too but.... She needs to show more vocal power but the beats are good. It's almost an Aalayih vibe too it. It depends on what you feeling right now. God a man and in love? not to many love songs. Single? party, flirty, sexy, songs? yea, even the ones that are supposed to be love songs"
4,Her Goodies? Pretty Goooood,"With good production, song order and a lot of help, Ciara pulls of one heck of an album. Now when I first heard ""Goodies"" on the radio i loved the song but I assumed that she would not be a great singer because the vocals on ""Goodies"" are quite bare. However, Shonuff's first lady proved me wrong with one pretty good album. Her voice may not be up to par with say Alicia Keys or Beyonce, but with songs like ""Hotline"", ""Thugstyle"", ""I Want The Title"", ""Lookin At You"" and ""Goodies"", it really doesn't matter. Do not fear, Ciera creates a hit with her debut album, so check out her ""Goodies"" NOW."
1,ciara is not janet jackson,"ciara has not had 5 # 1 albums, 10 # 1 hit singles, 7 top 5 singles from 1 album, 5 grammys over the course of 22 years now has she?"
1,baadies,so wats this all about.. what is she thinkin in her mind ..that we are all dumbasses to buy every crap that comes inside the chart ..i'll tell you something take an acoustic guitar just riff it no matter you donno how to play it an sing along with it..that music will be much more better than this piece of poignantly arranged crap.i simply don't understand the kind of music pop? rock? punk? may be junk
3,alright,"I don't think her voice is strong at all but she knows how to make r&b/hip hop music fun with her dancing like michael and janet jackson in the music videos, which were very nicely done. Her music also reminds me of aaliyah from the one in a million CD."
3,Great beats straight voice,Ciara Harris is a wonderful dancer and got the hottest looks but frankly that's what all she is.she has so many comparisons to the late Aaliyah but I still don't see it I think goodies and next step are the only songs that showcase Ciara and not the producer. but this album only did good because of the industry and the fans they only like it if it's catchy and pretty it's not even about talent no more the ones with talent are on the d-list instead of A-list. Ciara on the other hand is on the Okay list.
4,A Young Aaliyah,"I have to admit, I was not a Ciara fan at first, her first single ""Goodies"" has a tight beat that will forever get any party started, but I thought she was overated and a thing that would pass... until I heard the album. Now I am definitely a Ciara fan. I was surprised to hear that Ciara actually has a really nice voice, showcased on ballads such as ""And I"". There's not one song on this album that isn't good, it's one of those cds you can pop in and never worry about having to skip a song. She can dance and sing, she's pretty and seems to be a truly genuine sweet person, she reminds me of a young Aaliyah who is holding her own. I think she is one young artist who will be around for a long time."
4,"GOOD , BUT 2 ALIKE","this cd is ur ordinary R&B female cd but with a crunk n funk sound ,she's a beautiful and talented girl and has a sweet voice just like AALIYAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! when i first herd ciara's first song i thought :great anotha aaliyah wnab"" but she's not the onli one so we cant blame her... this cd is a pretty good cd and i disagree eith the otha reviews saying it aint worth it , because if u like R&B then this d is worth it...TRUST ME.. REMEMBA IF U LOVE AALIYAH THEN U""LL LOVE CIARA"
2,if this is crunk&B i hate it,"dont belive the hype the only thing good about this album is a cute girl she shakes her butt all the but to bad her vocals dont match up to he performance i have seen her live i understand that 1,2, step is a good single and luda raping on ohh is why i bought the album but i gave the album more and more chances i lisend to the album over and over but i always feel like im wasteing my life so i say if you wany good vocals get brooke V. if you just want to buy it cuz of her and her body waste your money my friend but i wont judge her on only this album when or if she starts on a new album i know she caN DO better. New wave Janet no new wave Aliyah no New wave Palua Abdul yes cuz i dont get chills when i here her ballets sorry c fans but you know she can do better"
1,Never shoulda happen,Think about it ppl Goodies was horrible ok guest apperences helped a lot that might b the only way she selles cds She cant sing and she hess no A S S at all(sorry Parnets) But hey it had to b said Ppl Do not get this Cd Believe me she gotta goCan u say 1 hit wonder i mean wow i keep seein 5 stars Retards
1,We despise this Britney Spears clone,"Blue Racer: Snake lovers, this is your friendly Blue Racer here to trash Ciara who does she think she is a black Britney Spears. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, you are right. This yokomama is uglier than an old Toyota and she can't sing or dance to save life. Blue Racer: 1, 2 Step is retarded as is Oh with Ludicrous(the sexist rapper) and the title track. Japanese Beetle: She only sold records as lowly souls who look like stale sushi bought this trash and I deserve to give them a karate chop, HAASHA(chops Ciara in half and bows). Sayonara!"
1,"Ugh, Ciara","I am sorry but there is no excuse for not being able to sing. I dont care if she's making Hip-Hop, R&B, Crunk N' B, whatever you should beable to sing. This girl cannot sing a note. She is horrible. Ciara is overrated weather you agree or not. She had to have some kind of connection because there is no way she got by on talent. What about people like me who can actually sing that are doing any and everything for a record deal. The music industry is so messed up. When I see big artists who cant sing it makes me sick to my stomach."
3,"If You Like Good Beats, Buy This!","We all know Ciara can't sing, doesn't write or produce her own work, and makes music with little to know substance but she is a great dancer and has great beats. I got this album a year after it came out and I'm happy I did. The songs make me wanna get up and dance around my home. I love ''Goodies'', ''Hotline'' and my favorite ''Oh''. I also love ''Next To You''Now to the bad: Ciara sounds crazy trying to sing ''And I''. She doesn't have the voice for a song like that. Also songs like ''The Title'' and ''Ooh Baby'' didn't bring anything to the album and are overall very weak songs. This cd should only be brought if you like to dance and like hot beats. Nothing more"
3,"Ciara shows off her ""Goodies""","I like Ciara a lot. Her first hit ""Goodies"" caught me and pulled me in. I ended up buying her CD. And there are some great songs on it like ""Goodies"" a hip-hop song with a great beat, ""1,2 Step"" the awesome, fun song that makes you want to dance, ""Oh"" a spicy song about Ciara's hometown with some rapping from Ludacris, ""Hotline"" a catchy song, and ""And I"" a Beyonce-like ballad. All the songs are groovable and Ciara definitely has talent, but it's pretty much just a dance mix. Although a good debut album, it's on my shelf now, not in my boombox. I hear Ciara all the time on the radio, and the hits you're hearing now are the best on the album. So save your money and turn up the radio."
3,Satisfying,"Ciara certainly doesnt have the best voice, but she makes the most of it. People shouldn't be so evil like that past reviewer because karma will always come back and get you. The best song is 1, 2 step. I think she can improve and is capable of better songs, but in essence this album is a nice start to a good career."
3,most are fillers!,"OK album not bad not great.Main tracks:1.Oh 5/52. 1, 2, step 4/53. Goodies 4.5/54. And I 5/55. Next to you 3.5/5 (were the f*ck is R Kelly???)All others are obvious fillers, kind of lame. songs to skip:1. Pick up the phone -1/52. Hotline 0/53. Thugstyle 1/54. Other chicks 2/5"
2,"Good for party, not for true talent","Ciara is the type os singer that has a Cd full of songs that you want to crank up at a party. If you are listening for some real vocal challenging music to listen to, this is not the album. She is not the best singer in the world. None of her songs are vocally hard. She is doing good for her first album but comparing her to Janet, now isn't that just setting her standards a little to high. There will only be one Janet and she always make sure she let people know that. If you are looking for some party cranks, get this album but if you are looking for some good singing, You will waste your money."
2,NO CIARA!!!,"I AM GOING TO PUT THIS PLAIN AND SIMPLE. CIARA LOOKS ALRIGHT. SHE AIN'T NO BEYONCE, J LO, OR ASHANTI. THE CD HAS SOME GOOD PRODUCTION AND HEAR ME AGAIN. I SAID ""PRODUCTION"", NOT SINGING!! CIARA IS ONE OF THE WORST SINGERS OUT TODAY. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TODAY! FIRST IT WAS BRITNEY SPEARS NON-SINGING BEHIND. THEN, J LO'S NON-SINGING BEHIND. THEN, WE HAVE ASHANTI WHO IS TERRIBLE IN THE SINGING CATEGORY! NOW WE HAVE CIARA WHO'S VOCALS ARE EXTREMELY WEAK AND SHOW NO TALENT AT ALL. SHE CAN DANCE HER ASS OFF, BUT THAT IS IT. IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THESE COLLABOS ON THE ALBUM SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE. ""GOODIES""(PETEY PABLO),""1, 2 STEP""(MISSY), ""OH""(LUDA). CIARA STAY AWAY FROM THE MIC AND BE A BACKUP DANCER OR SOMETHING ELSE. SINGING IS NOT YOUR TALENT AT ALL!!"
2,Not enough good songs,"I'm sorry but they said Ciara Goodies sold 125,000 in the first week I don't know how this cd is not that good it's cool It aint nothing fresh there is really no feel to this album and if i'm hurting any ciara fans I'm Sorry but the truth will be told"
3,small splah in the R&B pool,"The Goodies album was a pretty good debut. It was one of those CD's where you just skip through all the tracks and look for the singles. As for those....Well they were pretty good, nice to dance to and catchy as h*ll. Still they had no substance. Nothing to be remembered for, especially in the pool with all the other R&B 18-25 girls out there. Not too bad for a first try."
3,Good effort,"Ciara's debut album has some good moments. The singles were hot and memorable. Other highlights include ""And I"", ""Thugstyle"", etc. Her voice isn't the best but she really made some memorable songs. Time will tell if she becomes a huge artist. We will have to wait for the second album to decide."
1,The Worst Singer Ever!,"HOW did this glorified stripper get a recording contract? Her singing voice makes Ashanti look like Mariah Carey, Beyonce puts her dancing to shame, and a fourth-grader could of written her lyrics. This better be her ONLY album!!"
1,No.,"I think we have substituted good R&B and soul music (Aretha Franklin, Tammy Terrel, Minnie Rippleton, Pattie Label, Chaka Khan, Glady's Knight, Anita Baker) for light skin and long blonde weaves (Beyonce, Ciara, Oliva)."
2,Ciara's Being Stingy With Her Goodies,"You know, out of the 13 songs on ""Goodies"" I only enjoyed 4 of them: ""Goodies,"" ""1,2 Step,""Oh,"" and ""Next To You."" That's pretty much it because everything else sounded bland. Ciara isn't a good singer- and she knows it- and that's why she does this whispering thing, like she's singing under her breath or something. If she wants to stick around for awhile, she needs to try to be innovative by coming up with tunes folks can dance to and creating some new dance moves. The girl knows how to dance, that's for sure, and I know a lot of you are only hating on her because she's in good shape. Don't be like that, you know? Put on ""1,2 Step,"" start moving around, and then you'll have a body just like hers. Let Ciara be your fitness role model."
2,i dunno bout this....,"Ciara started off with Goodies but she didnt supply the whole album with it, the majority of the album isnt good, there are just 4 songs that i like and listen 2 which are ""Goodies"" ""1,2 Step"" ""Oh"" and the best song ""Hotline"" !Look, Ciara is ok, i would rather listen to her then Ashanti who is just awful. I Believe that she is pretty good but failed to show it with her debut, wait for next release to determine if she is any good...anyway it's!!! Time to wrap it up!, Ciara's ""Goodies"" was just ok, could have been good but failed to do so, i do expect her next release to be hot but what do i no, anyway we will see what happens.."
2,no real treat here,ciara is what she is a verry well polished R&B; singer.like blackdragon6 said she's just a plain jane face with a nice hardbody whom can dance.if ciara wan't to last she has to bring something to the table thats different.cause i guarantee you theres gonna be alot of clones out there.so she HAVE to be different the next time around.now to the album at hand to be honest whats driving this album is her sex apeal and her high quality production.but vocally she's not bringing anything different to the table.i wasn't exspecting her to but i gave her a chance anyeway.the album isn't garbage but its not good enough for all the buzz surrounding it.
3,Good Singles...Sucky Fillers,"If you're feeling ""Goodies"", ""1,2 Step"", and ""Oh"" burn them or just buy the singles because the rest of the album is just medicore fillers. Ciara can't sing a ballad, that's why she never released one as a single, she has limited talent and is overhyped like most of the cookie cutter so-called singers out right now, moving the spotlight away from the ones with actual talent. If you wanna here people with real talent go to your local church...lol...Buy Teedra Moses' album instead..."
4,Solid Debut,"Although I love Ciara, I didn't purchase this CD until her third single ""Oh"" was released. I loved her #1 single ""Goodies"" and her second single ""1,2 Step"", but I had to really give it a listen. After that, I realized that I will be getting my money's worth once I purchase her CD. Besides the three aforementioned singles, other greats on this album include ""Thug Style"", ""Hotline"", ""Pick Up The Phone"", and her current single ""And I"". Besides her music, she is also an incredible dancer as evident in her music videos and live performances. I am really curious of what her next album's gonna be like. But for now, I recommend ""Goodies"" for anyone who likes good, simple music."
3,"Good Stuff, but not all of it.","I'm not sure if it's really worth buying. There are only three songs worth listening to, ""Oh"", ""1,2 Step"" and ""Goodies"", and the lyrics are pretty lame. But those three songs have an awesome beat, so if you really like them you might want to buy this album, but the rest of the songs honestly suck. More good songs, better lyrics, and LESS FILLERS and this would be a hit."
5,Totally Awsome!,"I, being a hiphop/r&b fan, totally love this cd. Keepin it crunk wit tha help of the party pumpin Lil Jon, this cd is filled with great songs. From great party songs like 1,2 step, goodies and oh, to love songs like hotline, lookin at you, and and i. ciara really brings out her soft voice on this cd. a great buy. the bonus track (goodies rmx ft t.i) is a really good song to listen to, but t.i juss doesnt bring in as much support as petey pablo did on the original. still, a greatt cd overall!"
3,"One, two step","I don't think i know any of the songs besides goodies, but i like it a lot. You should go to YAHOO Launch to watch the music video. It's pretty cool. It's like on everyday when i ride the bus to school. This song is literally a good song to dance to. Keep it up Ciara!!"
1,I Think I'll Pass On This One,"I heard this album for the 1st time like a month ago and I did not like it the way everyone else seem too. I was trying to get into this because I know alot people who has this album and Ciara is really really popular right now so I had to check this out to see what all the fuss was about. The music here is very medicore as someone mentioned. The best songs are definitely the singles relesed besides Goodies because I never cared about that song but the video is great. Ciara is not a singer as mentioned for the 100th time already. She lacks emotion, range, power, etc. She's basically a dancer which is really her only high point. Everything from her vocals to the writing to the music is mostly average. Anyone who can dance can easily come and fill her shoes."
3,Most cliched album ever,"I got this CD because I thought 'Goodies' was okay and I loved '1,2 Step' however the rest of the album is not that great in my opinion. First, Ciara can't really sing, and you can tell she was one of those artists signed for her looks, not her talent. Secondly, this entire album is one big cliche. Every song on here has been done before. Every type of r&b or hip hop song you've heard before has been done again. You have the ""boy, you're so fly, I should be your girl"" songs, the ""pick up your phone when I call you"" songs and a whole bunch of other overdone concepts that Ciara did nothing but butcher with her restricted vocals. While some people might like the CD for this reason, I disliked it and found it very annoying. However, I give the album 3 stars for it's catchy singles."
2,I can't believe it,"It's probably good she started out with Goodies for her first single, cause it's the only one worth listening to. Her cd is boring and is not worth the price it costs. Maybe she should have let Lil Jon produce her whole cd. Take it from me, listen first before you buy.!!!!!!!"
3,Alright for a debut...,"Since she is supposedly the second ""Crunk and B"" artist out there besides Usher i expected alot of tight beats, and there were. This cd had to grow on me though because to me it doesn't sound like any other stuff out there, which is good. But the main songs that i listen to are ""Thug Style"", ""Oh"" feat. Ludacris (the beat is crazy), ""Next to you"" with R Kelly, ""Ooh Baby"" and ""And I"" (my fave). The other ones i can tolerate but i usually skip them. The only tracks that could possibly make it as a single are the ones i named before and ""1, 2 Step"" feat. Missy Elliot because it would be tight to dance to in the club. But overall i think this cd is pretty good for a first. Her voice is not as strong yet and the lyrics are pretty weak, but she does ok. If it weren't for the tight producers on here then it probably would have been trash."
1,zero stars,"i wish i could give her zero stars, because she's talentless. this album was terrible and i didnt understand half the songs on it. dont feel proud just because youre the first lady of someone so crappy. ""go cici, go cici!"" YEAH, go home!"
3,"love ciara, but she needs a new lyricist.","overall, i think that she needs a new lyricist. the chorus of most of her songs is just the title repeated over and over (especially: pick up the phone). i love ciara, she's sexy and has a beginner-beyonce voice and a ghetto aaliyah beat/style. she has potential, but they should've worked on the album more before they released it.best songs: oh, one two step, goodiesworth listening to, but not too catchy: lookin at you, other chicks, next to you, thug style, the titlequestionable: ooh baby (does this remind you of a tlc song?? diggin on you? it sounds like a remix or something, they just recycled the words and beat)awful: hotline, pick up the phone"
1,An Album Full Of Fillers,"I loved ""Goodies"" and bought the CD. The song was so hot, so I figured I'd get the see. Besides, the single did hit #1 and stayed their for a long time. Then I got the CD...OMG its awful! Ciara why! Ciara, next if work to write and produce your stuff, instead of having people make bad sounds for you. Maybe if you create a better album next time, you'll get other hits. ""Oh"" and ""1, 2 Step"" both peaked at number 2 on one chart, but never succeeded at any others like the masterpiece which is ""Goodies"" did! Ciara, work hard on your stuff, take singing lessons (your voice is boring), and come back in a long time from now, and you may score another hit!"
5,"Yup, Ciara has the GOODIES!!","This record is totally hot! It has two of Ciara's big hits ""1,2 Step"" and the title track! Ciara has an amazing voice, and she can sing through the roof. More importantly, is that this young lady has what it takes for a promising and lengthy career. In 50 years time, everybody will be talking about Ciara."
5,The music is great,"i Finally got the cd! When you *BUY* a cd you hear the songs that are NOT on the radio, MTV or other means such as Music choice. The Goodies remix is GREAT! So is the hotline song!!"
1,Her Career Is Over,"After she became a 1-hit-wonder for ""goodies"" on the urban charts, they realized how untalented she was. her voice is horrible, she don't choreograph her horrible hooker dance moves, and she barely co-writes like 1 song. her talent stops their obviously. the urban charts realized her untalentless, then she became a 1-hit-wonder their. looking for some success, ""1, 2 step"" became a white kiddie single...where kids in white towns loved it because they thought is was cool...NOT. it was getting play on white stations, not urban..what does that tell you?! then ""oh"" was released and FLOPPED! ahh...this proves she is a true 1-hit-wonder..after beging banished for untalentless on the real charts, she has to use dumb untalented kids! well, ""oh"" flopped just like your album. your career is over dumbass!!"
1,Dumb,"If you want to buy this because you like 'Goodies'...........then go and buy the single, save yourself some bucks because this girl is trash and how dare magazines an television compare her to Aaliyah. Aaliyah's lyrics, arrangements, harmonies, and just MUSIC is LIGHT YEARS ahead of htis wreck. All of her songs are about 'boy why dont you call me'....'ooohhhhh he look so good'. These ashanti type-simple-young- lyrics. God, girl, enjoy the success of your one good song because you dont have any other hits on this album."
3,"Meh, not so Goodie...","For a debut, this is a pretty weak effort. Yes, Ciara has an encyclopedic vocabulary for phrasing ""Ooohhhwhoawhoa"", but not much else is in the spotlight. It's well produced, and if electronic squeaks and beats are your thing, you'll be happy with this. I give it 3 stars mainly for production value. If Ciara has any real talent, it wasn't shocased here.I got this by request from my daughter who loves it, so what the hell do I know?"
2,"Hot singles, luke-warm album.","I listened to her CD at my cousin's house and I skipped over most of the songs. The only songs that I like are ""Goodies"", ""1,2 Step"", ""Oh"", ""Thug Style"", and ""Hotline"". The rest of the album is wack. She cannot sing at all and this isn't really a ""CRUNK"" album. If she had a better voice I'd give it a 3 but her singing is very weak."
3,The First Lady of Crunk & B is her album!!!,"Ciara is like the girl that cme out of nowhere. With her firstalbum my favorite songs of the Goodies album are 1 2 step,ThugStyle,Next to You,Other Chicks and Pick up The Phone. I sosorry Ciara but you can't harrdly sing, but you have the Goodies,and some of the hot boyz to jump on it...."
3,janet jackson is better,"not bad for a first CD, catchy tunes on here and a voice that reminds me a bit of aaliyah, but with her videos and dancing I've seen janet jackson do it all and can't understand how people think she's so original."
3,For her Genre is ok...,"The new Crunk n b stuff it's been done before and it's nothing new. We'se seen it with artists like Beyonce, Monifah, Monica and even Brandy singing about thugs and with rappers and hardcore beats. Of course Ciara has to go ""Crunk n b"", because she is not a great singer, in fact, she is less than mediocre. So she is overshadowed by awesome beats, but no good vocals to back it up. She has said it herself that she is a performer first. Because she is a great dancer, but to tell you the truth, not much stage precense...She looks like one of those girls that can stand out dancing in a club, but not on stage, she needs more work. And of course a lot of more vocal work. Some of the beats of the album are really good, but theres are hardly any spunk or punch in her notes or voice."
2,WHAT THE HELL!,"Ciara is yet another fake @ss Aaliyah wanna-be. I'm sorry, but she shouldn't try to be like the late, great, real ""Princess of Hip Hop & R&B"". I won't front like she can't dance, or that ""Goodies"" wasn't a decent song. It's just that she needs to find a more original image because she clearly looks, acts, dances, and sings like an Aaliyah/Beyonce' clone. This CD is just ""good"" to listen to on the radio, but I would never buy this album for my collection. Fortunately, I borrowed it from a friend before I wasted my money. 2 stars is really being 2 kind, but I gave her 2 because that was one hell of an effort to pull off the most believeable Aaliyah impersonation. Right now, her and Ashanti are neck and neck for that title."
3,Ciara CD on the way.,"I recently ordered the Cd online and its on its way, what prompted me to purchase it was the song ""1 2 Step"" and ""Oh!"", in her videos she reminded me of Aaliyah (sp?). I am not comparing Ciara to Aaliyah, I just think Ciara's style reminds me more of Aaliyah than of Janet Jackson.Im looking forwad to listening to her CD!"
3,Good Album,"Ciara is definatly talented. She has a good R&B voice. I have to say I love 1 2 Step and Goodies. They are my favorite songs. In fact, they are the most popular songs at my school. Everyone loves them. If you haven't bought the album already, then you should."
5,OMG!!!,"I have her album, and this ish is hot!!!!omg, Ciara is tha bomb..i really think that she is going to make BIG money outta this album, make sure yall cop dat..."
1,GARBAGE,THIS ALBUM IS CRAP. DONT BUY IT. YOU DONT WANNA LISTEN TO HER ANNOYING WHINY VOICE FOR AN HOUR. I HATE CIARA. I BOUGHT IT CUZ I LIKE ONE TWO STEP AND THE REST IS TRASH. EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS SHOULD GET THEIR MONEY BACK.
4,Great album!,"I really liked this album usually i'm not a huge fan of rap but this cd waz really good.I think Ciara is really talented at singing and i can not wait til her second album!My favorite songs on this album are Goodies,1,2 step,other chicks,and pick up the phone."
3,.......UM......UH....IUNNO,she can sing sumwhat but not power house it like others. she can dance and she's pretty. thats what hse has goin for her her ass and her face. cuzi swear if she couldn't dnace she'd b dropped. or she wouldn't even b signed
1,"""Oh"" is possibly the worst hit song ever!!!","""Oh"" is such a terrible song I cannot even tell you. How it made it to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on TRL is beyond me. The song is basically ""Goodies"" with the beat slowed down so much that you can't even dance or do anything to do it. The beat is just slow, dreary, and awful, and Ciara's singing leaves much to be desired. This song was only popular because people liked ""Goodies"" and ""1,2 Step"" and so radio stations automatically played ""Oh"" but once they realized it was a vile piece of feces and people stopped requesting it, it soon dropped off the airwaves. The fact that Ciara's record label unleashed this plague of a song as a radio single is enough to rate the entire album 1 star."
3,Goodies,"1.Goodies-A very edgy song thats shows women power along with class.....8/102.1,2,step-Sometin we can all step 2. Although it's not a jump and dance joint it really gets ya feelin energy.....8/103.Thug Style-Not feelin this song.Ciara needs some more effort.....6/104.Hotline-A sultry type of love song.Its very nice 2 kick back and listen 2......8/105.Oh-The best of the Best.Great song to play when u cruizin.Bumpin this song is credit....10/106.-12.-Way to slow for some people..no review.13.Goodies{Remix}-A alright song but doesn't compare 2 the single. But i luv the Jazze Pha intro....9/10"
5,I Do Want The 'Goodies',"This album is just bangin' crazy. Her vocal ability is amazing. God has given her the abiity to dance sing and rwrite I'm truly in love with Ciara ""CiCi"" Harris buy this album with the nice slow jam balads and club jams"
3,She is alright,"I give her 3 stars because the girl can dance, but her singing is awful. I don't like Ashanti, but even she can sing better than Ciara."
2,Pretty Weak !!,"I'm not a hater at all. I give credit where it is due. Ciara is pretty and young, she can really dance. The song ""Goodies"" saves her life along with the dancing in her video. Not really strong vocal skills. I expect more from someone who has to be in the biz and compete with the likes of Beyonce'. Babygirl might just get knocked down to being nothing more than someones ""Crunk&B"" Princess. Like a step above Ashanti with her non-singing self. I gave away my Ciara CD to a girlfriend of mine. She'll bump it in her trunk."
4,Above average...,"I just bought this album for several days but I've already found out several standout tracks like:~ 1,2 Step~ Hotline~ Goodies~ Oh~ Lookin At You~ The Title1,2 Step is the best song on this CD and this must be a huge hit soon. I still haven't digged deep into the slower ones. So maybe there are some missing great songs from the list. Anyway, this is a cool, sexy and easy-listening R&B; album. If you like Beyonce, you should like Ciara. Their style, songs and even their outlook are similar."
1,As impressive as cheese!,"D@mn, put a little makeup on him and keep him outta the fat suit and Martin Lawrence makes a fine looking woman! Unfortunatley not amount of LSD can make me think he has anything to say, 'bout as manufactured and souless as it gets. Go back to making those fabulous movies Martin and forget about the teenpop. We can't all be divas."
4,An Almost Perfect Album,"Ciara's debut album ""Goodies"" is an almost perfect album. It starts off with the radio-friendly title track ""Goodies"" and goes straight to another high energy club track ""1, 2 Step"". With the exception of ""Hotline"", ""Oh"", and ""Lookin' At You"" the rest of the album is mid-tempo but in no way boring. 2 of the best tracks are ""Ooh Baby"" and ""The Title"" which both flaunt an old-school sound. (""The Title"" even has some nice horns in the background) The ""Goodies"" remix isn't as bangin' as it could have been but since the original track is so hot fans will enjoy it anyway. Ciara's voice isn't amazing but she can definitely hold her own. Lyrically the album seems geared towards a younger crowd but there's no problem with that. Plus, Ciara wrote all but 2 songs on the CD and she is only 18 so it makes sense that her music reflects herself. With such a great debut album you can only anticipate what her future music will sound like 'cause I'm sure Ciara will be around for awhile."
2,Not good at all,"Nowadays, music seems to be taking a turn for the worst. If you compare this album to others of its sort, it's the same damn thing. There's no substance (unless you count drugs) in R&B (if you can call it that anymore) at all, except for sexuality. That's it. The only reason this album isn't 1 star is the beats, which aren't even that good compared to other beats by the producers. So, if you don't have any other ""R&B"" albums and buy this one, don't plan on getting it for lyrics. Also, don't buy any others expecting any substance, either."
2,Doesnt bring the good (ies)!!,"Im sorry, but why do people think that just because a person writes their own songs, that makes a person talented..Anybody can write a song, but if your lyrics have meaning, then you might be working with something..Im listening to the samples of this cd and I wouldnt even want a burned version of it..She has an okay voice and from seeing the video, she is a good dancer, but thats really about it..I dont know how people are getting signed these days but its a shame b/c they are throwing contracts at anybody...Good if you want to get signed, but bad for the listeners..Case in point, her single , which grew on me, was hot, but this album is far from that..She needs a lot more work!!"
5,Very cool......,"I really liked this CD. My favorite songs were probably 1,2 Step and And I. I liked Goodies, but it was played so much that it got old. I hope Ciara comes out with a new CD soon. I'm so gonna buy it!!"
4,B+ worth checking out,"1. Goodies - A+: Tight beat, great singing, no wonder this was #1.2. One,Two Step - A+: Same as #1 only it went to #2 only wtf?3. Thug Style - C+: It's better than the other slow songs but not that good.4. Hotline - A: Great dance song, sounds like a 1, 2 Step Part II.5. Oh - A+: The vocals are decent, but this is the best beat I've heard in a long time. The best on the CD.6. Pick Up the Phone - B-: Good beat, strange lyrics.7. Lookin at you - A-: Decent song.8. Ooh Baby - B: It's was alright, above average because of the singing.9. Next To You - C-: Just not for me.10. And I - C: Didn't care for it.11.Other Chicks - C: I don't remember it just must've been ok.12. The Title - A+: Nice song. Kinda slow but the beat is wayyy better than ""Next To You"" or ""And I"".13. Goodies Remix - It's the same thing as the original except T.I. in ther beginning.Overall: B+ - worth checking out"
4,"Some good, some bad","I have to admit, I LOVE CIARA! But some of the songs on this cd were just plain bad. Sorry. Don't make me out to be the bad guy. I'm 16, and I think shes hot and all, but she really sounds a little immature. Some of her songs like GOODIES, 1,2 STEP, and OH were good. HOTLINE, OOH BABY and OTHER CHICKS were ok. THUG STYLE, AND I and THE TITLE were semi-ok. but, PICK UP THE PHONE, LOOKIN AT YOU, and NEXT TO YOU were just plain really, really bad. The songs she has been in with Missy Elliott (LOSE CONTROL) and Bow Wow (LIKE YOU) were her best, even tho they're not on her CD. She could grow with age if she doesn't bounce off the face of the earth, and maybe her next album will be better. But for 19, she is look pretty damn fine, and is ok voice wise. Surpisingly, shes better in concert than she is in CD."
1,Vocals are GARBAGE!!,"How in the hell did this chick get a record deal??? certainly not for her vocals cuz it is CLEAR that she can't sing!!! The album has good tracks and beats but her singing sucks!! I woul,d by the cd strictly for the beats, not the talent."
1,"Good eye candy,but hurts my ears","Ciara is good eye candy but musically there isn't any depth there.""Goodies"" is catchy in the club but sounds like the other 99 songs that Lil Jon has out.I was looking forward to the cut she did with R.Kelly""Next to you"" but his Vocals are speeded up&the track seems like one of His throwaway tracks&I can see why because Ciara just doesn't have much there in terms of Musical."
1,Aight,The album is ok I like the last couple of songs. But the begining all sounds alike. To be honest if I had to by the album I would save my money.
4,Goodies,I think that the cd is good. I think what if someone buys the cd and you only get to hear the 30 seconds of it. That is the part you like but when you but the cd it not what you like. I think that you should give it more time to play.
5,Ciara-A Stunning Debut,"Ciara really blew her fans and the entertainment industry away.Mainly,people quickly judged her as a quick one-hit wonder.We all know that`s defintly not the case on this now platinum artist.It`s been a long time since I really enjoyed listening to an album fully without skipping over a song or something.Anyone can relate to her laid-back,round-the-way personality.She also has a number of great collaborations on the album which includes her mixtape and radio hit with another Atlanta native Ludacris on ``Oh``,a marvelous r&b song that R.Kelly laced on ``Next To You``,the banging hit single``1,2 Step`` with Missy Elliot,and other than the original Goodies song with Mr.Petey Pablo but also the remix with Jazze Pha and T.I.Ciara is very talented in the songs that she writes,her sense of music,and her talent of dance.Ciara,keep doing your thing.Personally,I give this album 5 stars!"
4,A Dance Record,"We all know that Ciara has a limited range and ballads are definitely not her strong points so right off the back that ""And I"" would be the worst track vocally. The rest of the album you could listen to when you're cleaning your house. But she's definitely growing as an artist so i do give her credit. The best tracks would be the singles that were released as well as "" Thugstyle"", ""Hotline"", and ""The Title""."
4,Keeps you moving,"The best song on the album is Oh featuring Ludacris. The beat is insane and Luda's rap is on point.The hottest tracks are Goodies, 1, 2 Step, Thug Style, Hotline and the Goodies Remix.And I and Other Chicks are 2 sweet slow jams - her voice is so small but it fits with these songs.The other tracks are not as outstanding but are solid enough to round out an entertaining CD."
2,Nothing great,"Ciara debut album Goodies was met with a lot of hype, but she has yet to anything to really impress me to the point where I'd want to see her live, unless she was opening for an estiablished artist like Usher or Robin Thicke. The album yielded three hit singles Goodies, 1,2 Step and Oh. While all of these were great club songs they really didn't have substance."
3,I am glad I have it in my CD Collection...,"It is a fell good album. It's fun to listen to at night with the windows down and the music cranked up loud. All of the songs sound alot alike. I am glad I bought it! It is alot better than some of the albums I thought I really would like that I ended up not caring for! I have to say I love the title song ""Goodies"", I can't get enough of it. It's alot of fun."
3,There's potential...but still needs work.....,"I thought that this album was...okay. The first few songs, especially GOODIES, are hints at great potential in Ciara. However, after this, the album goes downhill in that everything starts to sound the same. Unless she comes up with some new beats to go along with her nice voice, I am mighty afraid that her reign at the top will be short-lived. Hopefully, she will take a few lessons from people such as Mary J. Blige and Missy Elliott. If she keeps the songs real, and changes up her style every once in a while, I think there are good things waiting for Ciara."
5,off the hook,"love love love i just love this cd i cant get enough of it. every where i go i take the cd with me. i love the whole cd but my favorite songs on the cd are 1.2 step, hotline, and oh. i love ciara as an artist also, and i cant wait till she comes out with another video for her next single."
5,Ciara's Cd,"The goodies ciara cd is so awsome, i have listened to that cd...i lost count, but dat doesn't matter, it is awsome! you should buy it right here online or go to a store, trust me you're going to like it. It is one of the best cds i like, i recomend this cd to anyone who is cool and likes rap/hip-hop/r&b;its really cool so buy it right now."
5,awesome ablum,"this ablum is awesome,I love the song 1,2 step and my favorite song is Goodies. this ablum is for anyone who loves r&b; musicCiara is very Talented."
1,NO NO NO,This is a really bad cd in my opinion.I think Ciara has a great voice but she's not using it in the right way!!!I have listend to it and to me all the songs just sound the same to me..I'm not really feeling the vibe her Ciara!! Sorry!If you would like to comment to me about my review please contact me at cracklin@3mail.com
3,GOOD FOR NOTHIN',"I was very disappointed in this album. The single goodies had me hyped. And when 1,2, step came out I was convinced to buy. Ciara can dance but she is not much of a singer. If you are a huge r&b; fan do not purchase this album or you will be upset that you spent the money. Other than the first 3 singles that you heard on the radio,the rest is very shabby and sounds thrown together just to make an album. I only rated it a 3 because of 1st three singles from the album. Burn it or borrow it. But Don't buy it!D-dubb - one"
1,She is POP Garbage,"Her music is wack that's all I have to say. Im not even trippin over her vocals because everyone knows she cant sing. Goodies is wack 1,2 Step is not that bad but it's still wack and Oh is just as stupid as the title. Overall Ciara gets an F but that's just me. I'm always hearing her songs everywhere like they are the jam when they're not. She is overrated because she can dance and that's it. Other then that she is nothing and she will be that because talent is a gift and that is something she will never have ever."
5,I bet I want her goodies!,"I looveee Ciara ! This album is so amazing ! If you love Goodies and 1,2 Step, youll like this album ! My favorite songs are 1,2 Step and Hotline ! But every song are amazing ! You must have it !"
5,Krakin,"I bought the ciara cd the first day it came out!! i do agree with some of the other comments, from listening to her debut hit single- goodies... i thought all of her songs where going to be upbeat and fast. but when i bought her cd, they weren't. it wasnt a bad thing at all, it just goes to show that she has multiple sides she can express through music and if theres anybody who thinks different then your jus closed minded and ignerent to the idea of expressing yourself in more than one way.I love ciara, and i am her no.1 fan!"
4,good cd,goodies was a great cd from ciara. that has songs that sounds very gangsta. and is the best of 2004.
1,A Britney Spears wannabe...,She is even worse tha Jlo... Thank God she did not get the best new artist grammy. Her collabo in the Sly tribute was awful. She got a grammy for missy's video.Grow up and focus your career in dancing!
1,SHE IS SO GONE!,"THEY DIDN'T ALL HIT TOP 5!!SHE 1-HIT-WONDER ON URGBAN CHARTS W/ ""GOODIES""""1, 2 STEP"" KIDDIE SINGLE FLOP""OH"" FLOPPEDI AGREE WITH THE ""HATERS.."" BECAUSE THEY AREN'T HATERS, THEY SPEAK THE TRUTH. SHE IS 1-HIT-WONDER! UNTALENTED! HE/SHE!JANET ROCKS...SO DON'T DISS HER!"
4,Does Ciara Bring The Goodies?,"Well, It's was hard for me to decide if I would answer that yes or no. I liked many of the songs on here, but I think they could have showcased her talent a little more, with less fillers and more potential singles. All the radio singles, I loved, so i had to get the cd, and I liked a few other ones such as ""Pick Up The Phone"" ""Lookin @ you"" ""Ooh Baby"" and ""The Title. Overall, it really wasn't that bad of a cd. I think next time she should break out of the tight mold that she was in on this cd. All the songs sound similar, but since I like this type fo music it was nice for me."
4,Good For A First,"I didn't buy Ciara's album but I listened to a couple of her songs on the internet. From the songs I heard they were hot. Goodies, 1,2, Step, Next To You, Pick up the Phone, Hotline and Thug Style are killer. 8/10 - B+"
4,More than just Goodies,"I don't know what's up with all these fools critical of this album. This is one of the best R&B productions of the year. 1-2 Step, Ooh Baby, The Title, Oh, and Other Chicks are stellar and Goodies is a crunk-Little John classic. Give this talented young woman her due."
1,a true review,"SHE IS A TRUE 1-HIT-WONDER. AFTER HER TIME WAS OVER, SHE BEGAN TO FLOP AS THIS ALBUM FALLS DOWN THE CHARTS AND ""OH"" WAS JUST PROCLAIMED A HUGE FLOP, THANK GOD!!LETS ALL GIVE HER 1 STARS...HURRY GO...WHY TO DO THIS: SHE IS AN UNTALENTED 1-HIT-WONDER WANNABE!"
5,i bet u want her goodies!,"goodies- yeah, not the best song on the cd but what launched the cd. ciara getz major propz for her amazing vocals and this cd is what u call good ol r&b. yeah yeah, what do i no im just 12. but i am pretty good with this stuff, for a kid who listens to indie rock, watches independant films basically every week. yeah so get this cd, great songs on it include ooh baby, other chicks and parts of 1.2 step. great buy."
4,wowowowowow,"seriously, this album is prettty good. i liked goodies a lot when it came out, but it got sorta annoying and now i'm pretty much sick of it. i just recently got the cd though, and it's awwwwesommme!! i recommend you buy it, or at least copy it off somebody..! you'll be jus as impressed as me. my favourites:1,2 StepThug StyleHotlineLookin' At YouThe Titlethe other songs are fukkkkin good as well. these are jus the ones im really into at the moment. anyways, this cd is HOTTT!"
4,Goodies is a great debut!,"This is the first review I've ever done on amazon.com. There's a reason I chose to start with ""Goodies"". It's not a perfect album, I'll admit that, but I have to say that it's one of the best $15.00 I've spent lately on any cds. It has an abundance of ballads/slower songs. But who cares?! Honestly! Her voice holds out, and the whole album ties together. It's got to be the best debut album I've heard in awhile. But anyhows, buy this album, you will not be upset. The album has its high and low points, but it'll make you move, and it'll make you sing along! The songs are catchy, and hot. SO! I give this album a 4.5 and hope you like it."
4,Crazzie!,"This album is madd hott! i listen to tha album so much i know the words to every song.and the good thing about the songs on the cd is that they have an message for every one whos going through some changes of love & life.Every song is an MUST hear song except number 9 which is:Next To You. i was about to die with the corny lyric cause she kept saying tha word boy i was like ""Come on, give a break from this horror movie song PLEASE!!"".And number 5 wit ludacris is corny except his rappin parts cause the beat goes more wit luda and to me it seem like Ciara was just talkin out the words i was like come on put me in the recordin studios and i will hook this track up wit the real thang herre! but you just have to listen to them yourself. Enjoy -Imani G."
4,Liked it alot,"I bought this cd because of 1,2 Step I liked that song and can work out to it. But the rest of the cd is actually pretty good, especially for her being so young and this being her first album. She also wrote, WROTE, all of her songs which means she is talented on other levels. Her voice is nice, and any young woman can relate espcially to the song with R. Kelly. It wasn't perfect but great first effort."
5,Nominated for a Grammy!,"Ciara was nominated for Best New Artist thanks to her sensational debut album! Congrats, Ciara! You deserve it."
2,Just another wannabe,"I agree that this album has weak vocals. Knowing that I dislike pop...well, thats what she sounds like Aaliyah! Don't get me wrong, Aaliyah had it all down right. The only thing making this album work is the due to the DJ/hip-hop beats being present. She's a wannabe.I would give this a 2.5/5, just for me enjoying the lyrics and beats, otherwise, I get tired of it easily. Not recommended unless in to poppish-vocals."
3,sampled LTD feat. Jeffrey Osborne,"The world will hear from me, be entertained by me soon because of my passion for music when music was music, when it had a message that resonated throughout one's soul. That being said, C.C. sampled LTD's Love Ballad song by Jeffrey Osborne on the track ""The Title."" The throwback to this classic was enough for me to buy the album and I appreciate one's knowledge of true musicianship."
1,No one wants her 'goodies'...,"I'm sorry but nobody should be checking for Ciara's ""Goodies"". It's a bad choice for your (...). It's just not worth it. This girl (if you can call her that, the rumor that she was born a man has been proven true), well this ""girl"", sounds just like every other played out female on the R&B scene. Brandy, Monica, Amerie, Tamia, Tweet....is it even necessary to go on? She's a clone, and has watered down r&b to become like it's rap counterpart. She and many other r&b artists have somehow connected themselves to horrible ""crunk"" rap and have forever damaged the once art form that was popular rhtym and blues. Forget about seeing another Whitney Houston coming and saving this music genre, it's dead already."
3,"Fast songs are off tha chain, slow songs are lacking...","I took a chance and bought this cd even after I read all the negative reviews. I wish I hadn't. The fast songs are strait. Goodies, 1,2 Step, Hotline & Oh are coo. The rest of the cd is mediocre at best, typical r&b music. The only song I hate is Pick up the phone wich irritates the hell outta me (how many times can you say ""pick up the phone in 1 minute? according to this song about 12..). the rest of the cd is tolerable. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Not good and Not Bad,"Ciara is a great dancer and songwritter. But singing is not her thing.The songs on the albulm are good,and has a nice beat, but I think someone else with a better voice would of sound better. And her style is not original, we all seen a lot of artist like her. Her voice needs to improve."
2,eye candy but no real treat,"ciara beats saves this dull typical album.if she had a stronger voice then my ratings would be higher.but she doesn't have a voice.shes just a plain jane face with a tight body who can dance.its all about the production on this album and her body nothing else.goodies was a huge hit for obvious reasons,mainly the video and the lyrics but this album is just flat like her voice."
4,"The title ""Goodies"" fits perfectly","""Goodies"" is a perfect name for an album like this. Ciara is a great new artist who has a lot to offer. The album is packed with awesome and creative beats. Her voice is very unique also, it isn't anything AMAZING like Christina Aguilera's or Alicia Keys, but it goes good with the flow of all her songs. The high-lights of this disc are of course the title track ""Goodies"" with Petey Pablo, but also ""1, 2 Step"" with Missy Elliott and ""Thug Style."" I can listen to basically the entire album but one or two songs. Go buy this if you like R&B and Hip-Hop!!!"
3,Goodies ain't good enough,"It is so hard to find quality music these days. Most music is produced, written and sung by artists who have no clue about what life is all about. I would be the first to admit that I enjoy a good love song. But do they all have to be a perverted as what we hear these days. Ciara is no exception to the pact with her lyrics about running after and needing some man ""call me"". Love songs are not about that, but rather the respect, intimacy, chemistry etc shared between two. Ciara voice is somewhat weak at times however she does manage to hit a few good spots. She may flourish after additional training and exposure but she will not be an overnight success story. Even if her single ""Goodies"" has spent some time in the #1 slot. How many one hit wonders do we all know? I may be axed for saying this but her voice reminds me of Beyonce's but not as seasoned. Overall, this is an average debut. I would not run out to buy it but a free download is not bad."
2,..it's just the hype,"very weak vocals, very good beat. If the vocals were great it would hae been a great album."
2,"Where are those ""Goodies"", Ci?","I expected to be giving this album 1 star, so I suppose it's a good sign that she's getting an upgrade to 2, although that definitely doesn't make this album special. Ciara's debut album begins with the smash hit ""Goodies"", followed by the second single ""1, 2, Step"". By this point you are expecting a good mix of hot club tracks, right? Wrong. Most of the rest of this album is slow rnb, which with Ciara's voice is...relaxing. Or rather, it's the perfect album to listen to if you need a nap. I can't even pick a standout track on this album because they all sound the same. Sorry Ci."
2,Completely what I expected..,"I'm not gunna spend alot of time on this review like I would with others just cuz it's not really worth the time and effort. Most of the album is crap. ""Goodies"" is kinda hot I suppose but it's DAYUM overrated. The hottest song is ""Hotline"" by far. ""The Title"" is pretty good too but nothin special. ""Ooh Baby"" is kinda hot until the chorus which is completely unoriginal. My advice would be to download these tracks and save your money for somethin better."
5,The Best CD this year!,"I think everyone should buy this CD cause it's hot and it's straight FIRE!!! If you're looking for the best CD released this year, GET THE GOODIES!!"
5,best album,i LOVE this album literally every song on it is good if u dont have it make sure u get a copy its HOT
3,An Alright Debut,"Ciara being young typically talks about the things that mainly females her age are dealing with. The album has a nice feel. Her voice is very soft and the music is very addictive. This is a good album for the younger crowd, but if you love ""Goodies"" and ""1,2, Step"", I suggest you just get the single.Song highlights: And I, The Title, Pick Up The Phone"
2,Its okay,"This is album is aight. Its not the best but its not worst. First of all, Ciara doesnt have a strong voice so she is limited vocally. She has good tracks like The Title. R.Kelly produced track was disappointing, r.kelly is losing his magically touch. Anyway, I was expecting better. I just hope her next album brings more to the table."
4,"Aaliyah and Janet, what!!!!","I dont think that girl sounds anything like Aaliyah, for the simple fact Aaliyah can carry a tune, and I dont know where pplz got that from saying that Ciara is like janet too. To me she sounds like Jennifer Lopez, neither can sing, i got the cd, and i like 4 songs, goodies, 1,2 step, oh, and the title, and i like them for the beats."
3,Ciara's stayin in charge...............,"Don't u dare disrespect the playa playaz.................i guess i'm playa hatin then. This cd is ok, but it needed something else to jazz it up. There are alot of good tracks like, ""thug style"" and ""the title"", and the hit ""goodies"", but ciara needs to 1,2 step it up a lil bit. She still jamz tho."
3,:::gay-homo voice::: This is a D-U- Bizzle Review!!,"Let me just say that this album was good, except for the songs that started with, ""THIS... IS A JAZZY PHIZZLE PRODUCTION!"" in that homo-sounding voice, which is about half of all the songs on the album. It got to the point that any song that started with that made me cringe and just skip the track. I hate no talent producers that throw themselves in good artist' tracks at the beginning of songs. They ruin good music. Nobody wants to here you! STAY OFF THE TRACKS!At least Puffy keeps it to an intro and maybe one song."
3,not good enough for price,"Good, but wasn't as ""malty"" as I expected, therefore, too pricy for less than perfect taste, but I'm picky.Sorry, but I won't buy again."
5,Blonde Heat - The Sizzling Career of Marilyn Monroe,"As cited by the previous reviewer, this book outlines and critques' Miss Monroe's career through her films. It is a well written book, and also provides the reader with numbered rating scale (stars) from 1 - 5; the number ""5"" being the highest of course. I have a large Monroe Library and this particular book is written and presented to the reader in a very unique fashion. Beautifully illustrated on every film that Monroe starred in from her minor roles through her most memorable (""Diamonds"" ""How to Marry A Millionaire"" - ""Seven Year Itch"" - ""Bus Stop"" - ""Prince & The Showgirl"" - "" Let's Make Love"" - ""The Misfits"" to her last unfinished film, ""Something's Gotta Give""). The reader will enjoy reading and perusing through this book. I'm very glad I bought this one!"
2,"Just OK, some quality issues","At first I thought these were a decent product at a good price. I understand that they are not OEM but it is really about quality. The large rubber ""studs"" used to attach the product to the vehicle loosened after a few months. They did not come out, but loosened enough to cause the headlight to bounce around on bumps. I have taken both left and right out twice now to modify these rubber attachment points. I managed to tighten them up, but with a slight design change, these would be much better... You get what you pay for, but in this instance these were not cheap...I did like the fact they came with bulbs already installed."
5,Great,Collar is of fine quality and craftsmanship. Great quality for a fair price. works exactly as designed. Shipping was fast. I would highly recommend this product
5,Add these to your purchase!,"I bought the Metrokane Houdini Wine Preserver which is a small pump that uses these stoppers. The set has two. It's amazing how nice it is to open wine, NOT feel like 'that one' and then not HAVE to drink it because today's inexpensive wines turn ugly too quickly.Just place in one of these stoppers, pump a few times and the wine's good for (so far) up to 9 days. It's like we've never opened the bottle.I have now bought five sets...two for us, and three as gifts (along with the Preserver Pump)...worth every single penny!"
2,Works sometimes,"These things aren't great, they work well sometimes, but other times when you go to release them there was no seal. wouldn't suggest getting them."
4,they do what they say,"While I do think these aren't quite so useful for long-term storage, and the seals aren't always air-right, I do find them VERY useful for day-or-two storage, and to keep bottles 'covered'. i'm on my second set, as people either seem to walk away with these at parties, or they get 'lost in the shuffle' and are thrown out, but they fit just about any kind of bottle, they do what they say they'll do, and I find them very useful.If you're REALLY picky about having an air-tight long-term seal, you MAY want to try something a bit different, as these aren't really meant for long-term storage, and the seals wear down over time, it would seem (or so i've noticed on my sets). But if you follow the instructions for use, you will have a very good run of use on these."
2,Not working well w/ Rabbit Wine Pump,"I had initially bought the Rabbit Wine Preserver (Pump and stoppers) and it worked very well. After a few years of use I had to buy new stoppers and these were the only ones I could locate. They clearly state that they are ""for use with Rabbit Wine Preserver and Houdini Wine Preserver"". I don't know if it's because of some incompatibility or just a defect in the stoppers but they don't do anything near the good job that Rabbit did. More than half the times the bottles now leak and/or you can tell the bottle hasn't been really sealed."
1,you have to buy the pump!,i thought the stoppers had the pump built into the stoppers. Without the pump its kinda worthless.
5,Metrokane Vacuum Wine Stoppers,These wine stoppers are great. They keep opened bottles of wine from spoiling from contact with the air for days if not weeks. The big advantage of vacuum stoppers is that you can store the opened bottles back in the wine cooler on their sides without worrying about dripping.
4,exactly what was needed,"I have used and enjoyed my Metrokane wine stopper. But, over time, several of the stoppers became lost or unusable. This is the exact replacement."
4,"The book is great, beware the Kindle edition!!","I really enjoyed this book, but I bought it for a class for Kindle, and the entire 7th chapter is missing! It just isn't there! So, if you want her theological reflection at the end, DO NOT buy the Kindle edition...so frustrated."
2,Not the best physio book,"I used this book in undergrad and, although the pictorial illustrations in the book were useful, overall I found this book to be more confusing than need be. They were overly vague in areas where it wasn't necessary, yet would go into detail in areas that were not key points. I would not recommend this text for a physio psych book. I have since found other books, such as Carlson's Foundations book, that I would much rather use in my classes."
5,Great sound,"These are the first decent pair of headphones I've ever bought and I'm very happy with them. The sound quality is excellent and I'm hearing new sounds in songs I've listened to for years. The durability of the build is solid. After over a year of use, I had a tiny piece of the headband break which was entirely my own fault, but I called up the manufacturer and they sent the piece to me in the mail free of charge, no questions asked. After over 2.5 years, the cover on the inside of the earpiece (pleather) is starting to tear, but I've really put them through their paces on airplanes and such. I do travel with them even though they're meant for home use - which shows I can't be without them!"
5,Amazing sound,"Just arrived today, and I quickly attached them to my Ipod. All I can say is I'm truly amazed at the clarity of sound. I just listened to Kurt Elling sing ""After The Love is Gone, and I heard sounds never heard before. I'm not an audiophile, but I know what I like, and I like these headphones!"
3,Compared to the ATH-AD700 It Lacks,"After having the 'open' version of this model line I tried this closed version and found it lacking in detail and sounded rather dark in comparison, returned it.Both headphones are extremely comfortable, no complaints there. Staging is much better with AD700, probably because it is an open design. In fact the AD700 seems to set the standard for staging even in its low price range, it's amazing.I understand in this price range it is all a matter of preference because you are not going to find the high quality sounds found in the upper end models of headphones but the A700X pricing leaves it out of the equation for return on value. It does have slightly better bass response but muddy sounding in the low frequency range to me.The model ATH-T500 usually found elsewhere for sale, sounds better to me than the A700X and can be found for less with its conventional closed headphone styling."
4,really good sound,They sound really good and are very comfortable. I don't really like the 3d headband thing but if you use a elastic band to pull it together it works really well.
3,Broke too soon,My son really liked these headphones. The part that disappointed me is that they broke after 10 months. I can see cheaper headphones breaking after 10 months but these were more expensive and I was hoping they would last a little longer.
4,Generally good.,"I bought these based on all the raving reviews I read. Generally speaking, they are really good. I feel that the treble or high frequencies are a bit brittle. That could be my own ears fault as I am a senior these days. On the way positive side I have heard things in recordings I have never heard before -- some real detail things. The soundstaging is amazing!Overall, I think these phones are geared toward today's music styles more so than jazz and more acoustic type recordings. The more I listen to them though, the more I am liking them. It takes time to get used to certain audio items as well as allowing time for them to burn in. They'll be just fine!"
2,Poor durability,"Headphones great when purchased. Within 5 months however, there appears to be a ""short"" in the cable.........only picks up one side of stereo track unless the connector is wiggled and held in place. And this with only light use.Poor durability. But the actual sound, when it works, is fantastic."
4,"great sound, weird overhead","These sound great, defined bass (I'm a string bass player) and excellent high end also.Comfortable over ears. Connecting bits over top of head include pads that press againsthead and wire connectors that sit above the head. Not sure what all this is about, willbe tough to wear under a hat!"
3,ATH-A700 seem a little unbalanced,"These headphones provide amazing bass, but the treble is a little much, with mids being quite recessed. It makes it hard(er) to hear some vocals and guitars. Overall the build quality seems top notch, and the weight of the cans themselves is much lighter than you would expect from something this size.I was using these with a HIFIMAN EF2A headphone amp. Overall, I would say that I prefer a naturally flat curve when listening to music and these seemed like they carry a natural 'U' curve on the equalizer. Detail was crisp and bass was great, I just don't prefer them. I listened to the audiotechnica M50s and they have a more balanced sound stage."
1,bad mechanical design (sounded good until the connector broke off ),"i enjoyed these headphones for six months. today they were dead, no sound. it turns out the 3.5mm trs connector had fallen out of the cable housing. the 3.5mm trs connector was joined to the cable using nothing but a small amount of adhesive. audio technica should employ a design that can withstand repeated use, plugging and unplugging from a headphone jack without falling apart. i am switching back to my 11-year-oldSony MDR-V900HD Studio Monitor Type Headphones HD Driverwith the tattered ear pads. i would return these audio technica headphones for a refund if i could."
3,"great merengue cd, actually integrating rap with accordion","This is a great CD that I picked up once when I was in the Dominican Republic. It's first cut was one of the top airplay songs at the time (spring 1998). The songs start out with hip-hop influenced merengue that is so popular right now in Santo-Domingo, but the latter cuts on the CD are more merengue influenced techno-house cuts.If you like Puerto Rican style hip-hop, latin-influenced dance/techno (like C&C music fatory, etc.) or rap-style merengue, you should like this album."
5,"A MUST ""HAVE."" FULANITO IS DA ""BOMB!!"" GET IT NOW!!!","I had no idea how damn good this cd and group is. My gush, when I DJ and play the songs on this CD, everyone will dance. It brings cultures together. Fulanito serves as an excellent example of today's Latin music. It is taking over. Hey, I have no time for Ricky Martin, because I listen Fulanito at home and at work. In fact, I have purchased more CDs produced by Fulanito. They can rock any party!!"
2,"IN LOVE WITH IN ON SCREEN, BUT NOT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT","Loved this inflatable bed on screen. My daughter received it for XMAS, but it took forever to inflate, even with an automatic pump. One of the rails had hole in it from beginning. Also, have to be careful...definite suffocation hazard. If you purchase this...be aware you should check on toddler often. As soon as my daughter would roll over, her face was in the side rail that was still inflated. Only the mattress top is ""cloth"", not the rails, ends or head that surround mattress. We exchanged it for another, but the second one was opened previously and then taped shut by Amazon (?). We just returned it for refund instead of taking second chance with the bed."
2,Fell in love and now heartbroken!!!,When I first seen this product I had no intentions on keeping it as an official bed it was only to be temporary but my 2 year old daughter insisted that it stay out forever..I bought this bed a little over a month ago and it had a leak in it about 2 weeks ago and still have yet to find it...also the other side got a leak in it about 2 days ago and now the whole thing collapsed. My daughter is very upset. Although I did not expect much she is still devastasted. Also the person that talked about dangerous is also right. The holes are very large and she has slipped in them plenty of times and i heard her crying only to find her head stuck in the bed. It is now occupying the trash can. I would not recommend for daily use or any use for that matter...maybe for playing but thats it...
2,It was perfect until...,"This bed was Beautiful. We got it for our daughter and she was just as happy as us.It took a while to inflate, but that wasn't the problem.Our daughter turns 4 in Jan. 2006 and we always had to keep something on the open parts next to the mattress because we were concerned of her head or whole body possibly stuck, etc..The little flags that hang got torn within 2 months. The material started to look dirty within a few months also and needed constant wiping with a wipe. The top (where all the princesses are) wouldn't always stay straight, mainly would lean forward. And to top that off, the mattress popped about 1 month ago. It comes with a patch, but it didn't work longer than 2 days (and we KNOW how to add them because we've dealt with this kinda problem before). So as nice as this bed looks, it might not last long....just a warning."
1,Cute but dangerous,"We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses. Even though we purchased it as a ""play"" bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child. We immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be. It's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably wouldn't last long anyway. I recommend you look else where for your child's princess dreams."
1,Misleading travel bed,"We purchased this bed with the intention of using it for vacations, sleepovers etc. However, we soon came to realize that setting this bed up is no easy feat. It comes in four seperate inflatable pieces. You need to first assemble the footboard to the headboard which is done by fitting plastic pieces into each other and turning them. The only problem is they keep falling out. The battery operated ( 4 D cell batteries) pump that is included is painstakingly slow. Even with an electric pump which we used, there are many different air chambers that need to be filled and it is quite time consuming. This bed can not be set up in minutes as they claim and as far as taking it apart, to fit it back in the storage bag you need to completley deflate it. I would not recommend this bed to somebody looking for a travel bed. We ended up returning it."
2,Suffocating Hazard,We purchased this for our daughter solely for a bed to sleep on. We feel that it was extremely inconvenient in the setup and takedown. We also noticed that during the night she would roll over and fall between the side and her velvet mattress. Because of the danger of her suffocating at night we returned the bed.
1,Very dissatasfied!!! Can't rate a product i did'nt receive.,"First i would like to start off by saying the first shipment was damaged,had to let them know so they could send another shipment. So when it Finally arrives it is the wrong cleaner x-14 Bathroom cleaner citrus scent UPC 041737 26401 Dark blue bottle. I ordered x-14 oxy citrus orange bottle, don't have upc because i never received that product. Order number is 260418. if i would of returned i would have had to pay shipping which i try to avoid doing.I am very unhappy with the whole thing!!!!!!Ms. christina Garrison"
1,lady macbeth is depressing and stark,"this movie, which i thought would be a Shotakovit's opera, is dark, both literally and figuratively. It is morose, lugubrious and difficult to watch. It does smell of mother Russia, poor and desparate."
4,CPT all day,"One of the greatest albums of rap history. Ren still kicks supreme gangsta ... with his amazin skills. Pure NWA .... , 100%!! West coast classic, dont miss it, dogg!!"
4,Best Kept Secret of Rap,"Again it's proven with another album that Ren is one of the best kept secrets of the rap world. He's never received the recognition he certainly deserves. He has a knack for riding the beat spot on, and attitude-laden lyrics peppered with dark humor."
4,Seaport: A Waterfront at Work,"This book like all of Jack Leigh's other books is wonderful to page through. Although, photographically his other books are more my style, I believe this is a worthwhile book to own."
2,my least favorite in the series,"I'm a big fan of this Winter Solstice series, have all of them & most i rate 5 stars. i see other reviewers here like this cd for some of the reasons i dont like it, but that's music. we all have different tastes.amyway, find the 4 vocals jarring, even though they are pleasant. i play Windham Hill CDs when i want a break from vocals.besides the vocal tracks, the instrumentals here are too divergent, steel drums, a little nutcracker, some solstice stuff & the first volume in the series where a few xmas carols creep in.so ure left with a Windham Hill CD with no focus. it's not solstice, its not xmas, its not throughly meditative. it does sound like a random Windham Hill sampler which is fine for picking out the few good tunes, but given the high bar set by the other CDs in the series, this one is a letdown."
5,"Five songs (three vocals and two instrumentals) make this the ""best of the best"" of the series.","""Christmas Bells"" by John Gorka, Barbara Higbie's ""Lullay, Lully"" and ""In The Bleak Midwinter"" by Pierce Pettis are three of the most heartfelt Christmas songs/carols I have ever heard on record. Add to them Tim Story's rendition of ""Of The Father's Love Begotten"" and Paul McCandless' arrangement of ""Coventry Carol"" and, in my opinion, this is the best of the original six ""A Winter's Solstice"" recordings."
1,No More Vocals Please !!!!!!!!!!!,"I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed. Tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious,the rest of the tracks are good.I cant get to my CD player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.I now sample every song on the CDs and dont take for granted that all Winter Solstices are created equal.People,please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement."
5,WONDERFUL,I received the cd sooner than expected and in excellent condition.Thank-you so much.Robbie
3,CD-R Version with no information on the artists,"The music on this CD is great. I especially like Of the Father's Love Begotten and Sleepers Awake. But be aware that there is a small note on the Amazon sites that says: ""This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com"". So this is basically a copy of the original. This might be OK for some CDs but if you are a fan of Wyndham CDs, you know they come with excellent notes on the artists for each song. This CD has nothing but the list of tracks and the name of the song. Even the main artist of each song is not listed. The artists are listed on the small and slightly blurry copy of the original CD art, but they are listed in alphabetical order, so you have to do some on-line research to associate them with the song. This was a big disappointment for me. You might do better to search for an original."
5,"Bought this for one song, but liked the whole album","There is one reason to buy this album, for the song Random Drug Enforcement, to which anyone ever told to ""donate"" should relate. The album also has a lot of novelty style songs and old rock-style songs."
2,Too much doo wop on this one!,I was a fan of brownsville station and wish they would't have thrown in the towel. Cub played at a free concert and hung out with everybody afterwards. He was one of the greats. But this cd is all over the place and very eccentric.
2,"Wow, you haven't heard of Cub Koda?","...There's probably a good reason. Koda is semi-famous for ""Smokin' in the Boys Room"" and a fixture in obscure guitar/""roots-rock"" circles. I don't know all of his oeuvre, but this is mostly a county-fair hashing of doo-wop era rock with some notable guitar licks. I got it for ""Random Drug Testing,"" an amusing field holler I heard on college radio which, consciously or not, parallels the drug war with slavery. It's also the most original, transcendent piece of the lot. Koda is noted as his own producer, using low-tech equipment, and it sorta sounds it. I fast-forwarded through on first listen. Maybe it will grow on me."
4,Give me a moment.,"The cover of the Misfits' tune is astonishing! I discovered this band through reviews for 'Captain Dead..' on this site. Jack Pot! If you have a big heart, it should feel this band!"
1,"CD SUCKS!!! Guitar licks FLAT, vocals OFF",...very disappointed in the quality of the music. The guitar playing is feeble and the vocals were grating. The overall CD comes off as one of those sleazy hotel lounge acts...Buyer beware!
1,Sad - Sad - Sad,"I was very disappointed in this album. It's very 80s with drum machines, bad guitar and synthesizers. The sound quality is poor. Definately not worth the money."
1,HAS NO FUNK NOR SOUL,"This record just has no soul. It's a series of tracks with no cohesion (other than they fade into each other), and there's no theme to the album except bad-mouthing women.It is not well-made techno, and it has no feeling within the songs. It leaves me feeling cold and wondering what the point of the cd was. With so much good funk and electronic music out there, one would think that DAG would have picked up on what makes the funk so good.DAG is defunk now , and never had much of success, largely because their music [isn't good] and their cheesey slick image."
4,Dag comes up with a winner.,"Following 1994's effort,""Righteous"", the blue-eyed funk'n'rollers from the Tarhills has sweetened the kitty with a solid sophomore album. It rolls non-stop with a ol' skool flavor like a mix between the Average White Band and Carmichael-produced Commodores. It is funky, so funky that I daresay some of the young hip-hoppers and rapsters ought to take note. Get it before your neighbor does."
1,YUCK,I can't believe this CD is still in the marketplace. This CD is beyond awful. There should be a law that outlaws terrible music by white boys trying to sound like true FUNK and R&B.
5,Scarlet Feather,"When reading Joan Grant, you enter into a new world and must simply continue reading it until the end. Good reading."
1,"Terrible, Predictable, just plain bad","The movie was terrible. I cant believe I spent 7 bucks to see it in the theater and I'm upset because I'll never get those two wasted hours of my life back. As soon as I walked out of the theater I forgot the whole movie because there was nothing memorable that happened. No good one liners, nothing. Just a bad plot, bad acting, bad everything. Dont waste your money and especially not your time on this wothless movie."
2,DEAR GOD this was bad.,"When Sly Stallone is the best actor in a movie, watch out! This movie was so bad, I wasn't sure it wasn't a comedy."
2,No Suspence,The problem with this movie is you can't play Rambo and then try to make a serious movie. There is an attempt at a story but nobody stands a chance against Stallone and that the problem. Every ten minutes or so he just beats up or intimidates another villan. I think Stallone is a good actor but I wish he would stop playing Mr. Invinceable. It would have been a better movie If the villan's were someone you should be afraid of. If this was a action movie you tend to accept one villan getting it every ten minutes. But when you try to make a film with a plot the villans should have more character. It would be nice to see Stallone in a film where he build the suspense. Where you have some doubt on wheter he could pull It off. A movie like The Fugitive; I think would be an interesting character for him.
2,Carter will help you catch your Z's,"I was sooooo bored with this movie. I could not wait for it to be over. This movie had very good intentions of being a good movie but just did not throw everything together the way it should have been. I thought that the plot was good, the movie was kind of hip, but just did'nt do it for me. More action, more action, more action. I mean come on, This is Stallone. Where is the action?"
1,bad stuff,"this movie is the worst. nothing happened. when i saw this in the theater, i walked out during the middle. i should have saved my money for something better."
2,I've seen better revenge movies!,"Not knowing anything about this movie, only knowing it was a remake of a movie made in the 70's, I went out to rent it. I was kind of excited because I'm a big Stallone fan.I was disapointed at how the movie drags on with stallone going to character to character, and than going back to that same character. The action scences(probably one or two of them) were okay, but they were to short. This was Stalones worse movie, he is although an actor who could play a good revenge role, but in this one he could of used a better script."
5,Fantastic movie!,"All i have to say is Stallone is one of the most underrated Actors in the Industry for whatever reason and hes proven time and time again that he is an Amazing Actor with Get Carter being no exception.The Movie is gritty Stallone fits the part perfect,Mickey Rourke is a slimy villian as he and Sly are my 2 fav actors this was a perfect pairing.Rachel Leigh Cook is really good as well.Good story,some gritty violence and a an all around Excellent movie.Get it!"
1,Nope,"First Sly movie that I ever questioned his ability as an actor. Really, the movie was that bad.The big problem was thst it didn't meet either of my action movie preferences,the loud 80s action film of big punches or the fast and slick Bourne Identity action-suspense film.Just blah and slow."
5,SURE IT DOES!!!!!!,"This is a real Stallone, a real, improved and renovated Stallone , this movie can be subject of cult for a few followers of good movies, getting by now away of commercial sucess Stallone has been trying in the last years to be involved in judgemental , troubled , confused and very human characters this is an actor ambition, good ambition , still he is in that process of maturity in personal and professional levels , this movie is quite an achievement , also i need to mention that co starrings are the best of the best , Mr Caine and Mr Rourke are awesome in their interpretation they complement each other in a very enjoyable way for the audience , specially Rourke with Stallone, check out the argue sequences , very real discussions they help you to comprehend how hard life is, I repeat this movie could easily become a cult film and if that comes to happen would be very well deservedHM"
4,Pretty decent film -better than what is said,"When Jack Carter went off to find out if his brother had been the victim of foul play he never thought he'd enrage so many viewers who found it boring or too violent or not violent enough. This movie does tell a story, and focuses on how Carter realizes what a waste his life has been, what he could have been -with his dead brother as an example- and of course he is not, and it does it very well. Not every movie has to be full of shootouts and gore. This is a great work of style, and the dull opinions of how the excess of style towers the plot (although respected ones) is a proof of how badly educated common audiences are (the ones who prefer linear stories). Forget the cynicism and watch this movie for what it is: a good piece of entertainment"
4,good movie for another era.Haven't seen the original but..,"If this movie was made about 20 years ago; I could see it being a hit. The trouble is that Stallone is choosing scripts that would have worked ...if done in the eighties.We've all seen this plot before. He performance is good but his character is too one note. He wants revenge for the death of his brother. I didn't believe his hit man with a heart of gold act though. The action scenes were good. The action was very influenced by music videos. While not a total waste of time the movie needed more substance to work.I could see Stallone in roles taken by Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro..I think that he needs a role that doesn't put him in the tough guy mode. ""Cop Land"" proved to me he could do Oscar material."
5,Get Carter,"although the story line was not exceptional, I found the cinematography wonderful stallone played well as did all the cast exspecially caine i wsvery impressed"
3,Apart from Sylvester Stallone....another thing impressive is the background music!,"Stallone is good...music is good...plot is good, but one thing which could have been good is the script."
2,.,"This is worse than my eighth birthday party. Some kid brought his pet Teradactyl and let go of the leed. Also, the hired band 'The Caz Dolowicz Experience' didn't show up. Something about a hijacked subway train. They think we're mugs? Anyway, the photography in GC was worse. Everbody too big in the frame and sort of artless and wobbly. How does Rachel Leigh Cook manage to appear in so many disasters? Does she have a homing beacon in her nose? It's a very small nose which just goes to show how amazing technology is today. Stallone looks like he's on Dialysis. I didn't watch the end. It either ends in a friendly game of Jim Rummy or a blowtorch enema. Gosh, I wonder."
4,Well Done stylish tribute to original,"Get Carter with Sly Stallone as Jack Carter succeeds in its purpose to pay tribute to the 1971 Michael Caine classic, and doesn't come off as a rip-off at all. The setting of this one is rainy Seattle and Sly, dressed like ""Frank Sinatra"" does a great job with this updated script, which keeps the original plot intact, keeping it a stylish action film with heart and mind. Michael Caine even has a role as one of the many bad guys Sly takes on.The ending is a significant departure from the original, this time being how we WANT it to end. It could be that with ""Copland"" and this Sly has found his midlife muse, really the same as he always was: the brooding tough guy with heart and soul.Of course the original is better...what original isn't? But this is the best remake anyone could hope for."
2,"This is not ""Payback""","""Payback"" was this straightforward story of a ruthless man with one fixed idea: getting the money which was due to him. It was dark and violent and the movie worked because the Mel Gibson's character was not calling out for our sympathy. ""Get Carter"", also a remake, is following a similar linear story line and gritty atmosphere but is failing in that the movie producers decided to make the Sylvester Stallone's character likable (being Stallone, I guess). And this is where it slips for the worst. Why did they have to put so much (twisted) morality in this guy? The scene I really hated is when Carter throws the bartender who abused his niece by the window after he tells him ""what would you think if it was your daughter"" and ""you already killed yourself (by abusing his niece and other women)"". But is it the Carter who in the same movie sleeps with his boss's wife and who beats bad payers to a pulp? Where is the morality here? This just does not make sense."
3,"Kinder, gentler Carter","[Review based upon Theatre viewing].Michael Caine can out-act Sly Stallone but he can't out-enertain him: I nver saw the 1971 original but Stallone, like John Wayne before him, eats up each frame, dominating the enterprise, kicking up a few notches, to use that millenium cliche.Glad he was on hand, because this one of those could-shoulda-been-alot-better deals: seemingly, at every turn Carter's behavior is criticized and analyzed by his exasperated sister-in-law and her teenage daughter. Another example of militant feminism being injected into a plotline that is really pitched to those men and women who like to watch a macho guy snarl, growl, kick, and smash down.Very effective musical soundtrack, with Groove Armada's ""If Everybody Looked The Same"", the stand-out. [Though not on the actual soundtrack album - check out Groove Armada's ""Vertigo"" CD]."
1,Expensive and hard to find,The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements. I would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612C black replacement cartridge C6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660C other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case.
1,poor quality,This ink product never worked. I contacted the company and they said it was passed the return time. I explained I buy ink BEFORE I actually need it so it can be in stock for the time it's needed. They were supposed to review and get back to me... never happened. This was the second defective product from them. I will never waste my time and money again.
4,My ink purchase,"I bought this HP cartridge thru a school project in Iowa.Everything was as advertised, and works well.Those people really work hard to please ."
4,Excellent but pricey!,This is a very good cartdrige for a very good printer. The one problem is the cost of the consumables. The ink cartridges are expensive compared witht the price of the printer. I bought the 610C years ago and it still works very well. If the price of the cartridge was lower I would give 5 stars.
3,HP No. 20 Blk. Inkjet Cartridge: TOO EXPENSIVE!,"The HP No. 20 Black Inkjet Cartridge performs very well. My only complaint is that it is simply TOO expensive, especially when compared to other inkjet cartridges. I print a lot and have to replace my cartridges often, so I feel the brunt of the expense every time I need to purchase a new one. I would love and appreciate seeing the price drop drastically in the near future. If there is a reason why this particular inkjet cartridge is so expensive that I could understand, it would help to ease the pressure I feel because it's the only inkjet I'm able to use with the printer of my choice which prints on both sides...A feature I need to save on paper usage and space. Of course, this is just my opinion. What I print out pertains to my favorite hobby and I'm not printing out anything to sell for a profit. Probably, that's why I resent the cost so."
2,"Started well, but that's about all....","Warning: The 80/20 rule applies to this book - 80% of the humour is in the first 20% of the book!I found that the interesting and humorous ""set up"" of the plot was wasted. It just wasn't carried through, with the plot finally fizzling out in an ending that reeked of ""my God, what's a quick and easy way to finish this?"" The peripheral characters seem to serve little purpose apart from the way they are introduced - once again, a waste of talented writing.If you think you *might* like this book, try ""American Psycho"" instead."
5,I Love This Book!!!,"As a budding author myself, I always love to read first novels by young authors. I love this book. The dialogue is authentic, and the character is truly believable. I truly am looking forward to Mr. Jaramillo's next effort...maybe by that time, my book will be out! (wishful thinking!)A must read...I am recommending this to all of my friends! It is funny, honest and very contemporary.I wish Mr. Jaramillo all the best, and I hope the warm reception he has received from his readers will be the stimulus for another book soon!( I am re-reading ""Going Postal"" as I write this!Thank you"
3,"Flawed, but more than worth three pints","Jaramillo's character is well wrought, but the plot is not. Ironically, his depiction of the Bay Area made me homesick."
5,fabulous piece by a wing-nut,"Dude, I love it, love it, love it!!! This guy is insane! Stephan Jaramillo has a special skill called detail, all the way down to the platform shoes. The images are fun and the dialogue is fierce. My only question at the completion of this book was ""what if the love doesn't work out? Is he going to pull a lil' O.J. with his Colt 45?"" and ""what happens to Callahan? Does he ever return?"" Do you see what I see.....?"
1,I'm being generous ...,"You know that old question, what would happen if 6 monkeys typed on 6 typewriters for eternity? Well, now we know. And it sure ain't Shakespeare."
1,"I'm a mailman, and this isn't funny.",This mocks the dignity of the letter carriers of the United States Postal Service. Frankly I'm disgusted.
2,"THE REAL POSTAL SERVICE WAS NOT ""EXPOSED"" TO THE PUBLIC","THIS BOOK HOWEVER FUNNY WITH THE WORKPLACE SHOOTING THAT AFFECT THIS NATION A BOOK THAT DEALS WITH CAUSES AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES WOULD BE MORE BENEIFICIAL TO AMERICANS IN AND OUT OF THE POST OFFICE. SUCH A BOOK EXISTS ENTITLED: THE ""REAL"" U.S. POSTAL SERVICE EXPOSED.(ISBN)#0967502004 THIS BOOK DETAILS MALIOUS CONDUCT BY MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS THAT OFTEN TIMES ""PROVOKE"" THIS VIOLENCE."
3,"Nice book, edit the Evolution part for you children though!","This book (1 of 7) is a good way to introduce that there are continents. It goes through the weather, type of landscape, people, etc. It is a nice book to have on hand for kids to flip through. You can read it to your 4+ year old or they can read it themselves in 2nd+ gread. Nice photos. If you want them to visualize there are 7 continents get these nice books. If you would rather just get them all in one get the National Geographic Beginners World Atlas! It has superb illustrations, great text, and makes a great book to leave out on your coffee table for easy flip-through! I woudl probaby just get the Atlas if I were doing it again, but these are nice books."
1,can eject car seat in accident,"In searching for a car seat I saw a Consumer Reports video that said their tests have shown this seat to be unsafe. They said that although the company claims its seat sits securely in the base, it did in fact eject the seat during Consumer Reports testing. Just be sure to do some serious research on this item before making the purchase as CR said to avoid it."
3,My favorite band of all time!!!!,"I'm 42 and when I was 18 my boyfriend took me to see the Kingbee's. I'd never heard sound like that from a 3 piece band.I fell in love with them..Then a few year's later they became the house band at my favorite local bar in Hermosa Bch., Ca.I thought I died and went to Heaven..Get it you'll love them as much as me!!!P.S. Hi Jamie XX"
3,Kingbees,"There are a few good songs on this cd, but a lot of it was a bit tiresome. Since it was a combination of their first and second cds and I saw that they have made several, I would listen to more recent work, with the hope that their music has matured and improved."
5,Brings back memories,I lived in Dick's hometown (Ann Arbor) in the 80's and I saw him play at least a hundred times. I bought the lp when it first came out. I'm looking forward to hearing it on CD.
1,Do not buy this edition,"As an avid reader of military history, I was keen to learn more on King Charles XII of Sweden. Unfortunately I am none the wiser on recieving my copy of this book. In fact calling it a book is a stretch, it is a photocopy of a book, a badly copied photocopy of a book. In some sections ink blotches cover parts of the text, rendering them unreadable. In other sections the text is barely visible, again rendering it unreadable. If you wish to study King Charles XII, find another publication."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I found this item on this site and went to a babyrus store to purchase it. I took the items out of the bag to look at them and I was so disappointed! The colors are not vivid like they are in the pictures. They are dull and faded looking already. I can't imagine what the comforter would look like after it had been washed a few times. The crib sheet was very thin and scratchy. The lamp was tiny and looked to be cheaply made as did other components of the set. I love the thought of an entire ""Nursery in a box"", but this set sacrifices too much in the quality department in my opinion."
5,This is a very cute nusery set,"I bought this nusery set for my sister, she loved it so much. This is a good value. you would spend this amount on just the crib comforter set. It also comes with lamp,mobile, wall hangings and growth chart. It is so cute. It is cuter in person. I would recommend this comforter set to anyone."
1,Horrible Helpers,"I wrote to Amazon and babies r us repeatedly and never once got a reply, nor did I receive a notification when this bed set came into stock, even though I had my name on a list to receive a letter stating they had some. I am very upset with tthe customer service. I have tried calling and while on hold they hung up on me. So I took my business elsewhere, I went to BabyUniverse.com and payed $10 more, but got free shipping, and I received it after 4 days! They even emailed me to thank me for my purchase. I think Babies R Us should check their people skills, because they've lost one loyal customer!"
4,question about bedding?,"Hi-sorry I don't have a review. I am 20 wks pregnant and thinking of registering for this bedding set. However I noticed it says for 12 months or older. Why? Does anyone see why a newborn couldn't use it? I was thinking because of the quilt (which I would just use later). Also, the person I spoke with at Babies R Us said the headboard animals are detachable. So if I detached the animals then would it be safe? The bumper technically doesn't go all the way around the crib-is that a safety hazard?Thanks for any responses I get to this!"
2,Goes flat fast,"I have a Labrador retriever and the first time he chewed on this toy it went flat and did not return to its inflated state. Then my dog lost interest in it because he couldn't get it to squeak anymore since it stayed flat. I think for my dog, something stronger, like a tennis ball, is better because he can chew on it and it expands and contracts with the force of his chewing."
2,No durability,"We have two rubbery basketballs about this size and were trying to get something similar when we ordered this. It took our 12lbs miniature doxi less than 20 minutes to chew a hole in it. The two rubbery ones we have? We've had them for about 6 months, he plays with them every day and they're still balls instead of piles of plastic parts. Definitely would not buy again."
4,Great reference book!,"This is a wonderful reference book. If you are good at drafting patterns you will love it. However, there are no color pictures and all of the quilt blocks are hand drawn. The blocks are great though and the author even tells you where you may find the blocks, e.g. KC Star, Laura Wheeler, Marie Webster, etc. Then there is a complete alphabetical listing as well. This is a must have for the avid quilter!"
4,Good Children's Story,"This is a good children's story with very good illustrations. Fun to read, and getting used to the word pronunciation takes some practice. This book also includes a nice little glossary of cajun terms used in the story."
5,Wonderful book!,This book is wonderful for any person! My 3 year old loves the accent and the story line. She just can't get enough and neither can I! This is a fun new (ish) story line for adults and kiddos.
5,As advertised,"Cute traditional story with a wonderful cajunland enhancement. There's even a brief ""dictionary"" of the terms for anyone who is not familiar with the terms (although I am not sure you would be drawn to this book unless you were familiar with them). Along with Good Night NOLA, these will be treasures for my grandson."
5,"Fun for the grown-ups, too... sho'nuff","One sentence into this book and even the not-keen-on-bedtime-readers will find themselves lending life & voice to Artell's characters in this whimsical updated romp of a fairy tale. What fun! The drawings are superb, but it is the story that shines here. You will find yourself speaking cajun almost as if you were born to it. At least that's what you'll tell your friends, when you recommend this book to them to dazzle their own children."
5,Petite Rouge: A Cajun Red Riding Hood,"Mike Artell wrote this book so precise that even if you don't know what a cajun accent sounds like, you can't help but read it with one. He grasped the characters and gave an alligator personality. This book was hilarious and I love his ""dictionary"" of cajun terms that he has in the back of the book."
5,Great book!,"Bought as a Christmas present. My kids absolutely love this book, a great spin on the traditional little red riding hood!"
5,a great book for all ages!,"One of the cutest books I've ever read. I read it to my 5, 15 & 20 year old children & they all loved it!!!"
5,You sho nuff need to buy this one!,"I bought this book after renewing it twice at the library. My girls (4 and 5) LOVE this book. It is read most every night and I don't get tired of it. The dialect rolls off your tongue easily, the rhyming is clever, and the pictures are cool too. I find myself still laughing out loud even after having read it a billion times. A definite must have for your kids collection."
5,I like dem story!,"This is the most wonderful of books! You can't read the book outloud without magically developing a Louisiana accent, for the phonetic system devised by the author is so easy to use. I love to make ole Claude, the alligator, have a rough, raspy voice. My four-year-old son absolutely loves this book, and his pre-school teacher read it to the whole class. It's fun, it's funny, it gives you a taste of Cajun culture and of the French language, and the illustrations are delightful! I've read it to my adult friends as well-- everyone loves it!"
4,Good ring for the price,My husband bought this for me to accompany my engagement ring. It is a good ring for the price. It's simple and comfortable.
2,Identity crises,"Well it seems everyone has their own differing opinions and this band seemed to have a differing opinion on what it was trying to accomplish musically. I grew up listening to these kinds of progressive rock bands and I really loved this bands first album, although I admit I kept thinking that it was an attempt by Rod Evans who had previously sung with Deep Purple, to sort of ""get even"" with his former band by attempting to out-gun them with his new musical line-up.The first record had a very aggressive though not necessarily ""heavy"" sound. The musical interplay conveyed a sort of rock ""drama"". If you liked the musical direction the first record took you probably won't like this follow-up recording at all. I was amusued at the ""Pink Floyd meets Santana"" analogy. This is unfortunately an appropriate comparison, what a disasterous combination! The bands first record was ""Definitely Listenable"", unfortunately ""Sufficiently Breathless"" left me ""Totally Bored""!"
3,lacks the passion of the self-titled debut,"This is far from the seamless debut album. The rock numbers seem more labored & contrived. The best things here are the title cut, which has an incredible acoustic guitar intro & great urban lyrics; Starglow Energy, a ballad with great lyrics that keeps building in intensity & is a great showcase for Rod Evans voice; and, Everything's a Circle, which has a great intro, lyrics, bass riffs, and Allman Bros type guitar. It's a pretty good album, but not nearly as great as their debut."
5,To me one of the top 10 albums ever made,"The first time I heard Sufficiently Breathless was on Birmingham,Al radio station WZZK back in the 70s. Father Tree was the D.J.! This is still one of my favorites. I work at a college & every student I've ever played it for loves it."
5,The SECOND Best Hard Rock Album you (probably) never heard of,"Captain Beyond!And, the BEST Hard rock album you probably never heard of is- the FIRST Captain Beyond album!I've not heard the third, but I CAN tell you that if you like intelligent , well thought out hard rock, then these albums are for you!!!I bought them both new in the 70's & I've never tired of them!There is a primal energy here that fails to surface in many studio albums ( the ""live"" album is where many shine); the studio is where bands are often good, but not great.Captain Beyond turns this paradigm on it's head!These are masterful, powerful studio albums done by an all star crew at the top of their game!!!"
2,Not A Good Followup,"I'll be brief. This follow-up to their first album lacks direction, is musically boring and not worth the price of admission. I am 50 years old and was wondering whether the first album was as good as I remembered. I got it 4 days ago and can't stop playing it. I bought Sufficiently Breathless a year ago, played it once and put it back in the drawer. I got it out tonight to give it another chance and it bombed! The feeling I get from it is that some A & R guy at their record company got a hold of the band and said they needed a totally different sound for record 2. If they had put half of what was in 1 into 2, it would have been great. But it isn't. Sorry, I have to call it as I hear it."
4,BEYONDS BEST,FANS OF EARLY PINK FLOYD AS WELL AS EARLY DEEP PURPLE FANS WOULD LIKE THIS DISC WITH DPS EX SINGER ROD EVANS. IT IS CLEARLY THIER BEST WORK.
1,Captain Bogus,"Captain Beyond's second album is so weak in contrast to their brilliant debut it's hard to believe it's even the same band. Whereas the first album is heavy with a variety of musical influences, the second album sounds like watered down Allman Brothers. Without Bobby Caldwell's excellent drumming the progressive quality of the previous album is gone. The only worthwhile song is the title cut which musically resembles ""And You And I"" from Yes' Close to the Edge album. Avoid this and get the first album."
4,"Hippie, Trippy Fun","Some of this is a little too 1970s for me (the expand your mind noise tracks for instance) but sometimes all that trippiness leads to the profound insights your neighborhood dealer always promised. This album is well worth a look for those who like classic rock and are looking for new discoveries that haven't been played into a bloody pulp by your local classic rock radio station, especially the title track."
5,As great as the 1st...only slightly different,"There are quite a few fine reviews for this - I would just add this: ""Evil Men"", ""Starglow Energy"", and ""Distant Sun"" are as good as 3 back-to-back-to-back tunes get. Enjoy!"
4,excellent,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this second Captain Beyond album except it is not the first,Captain BeyondThat was one of the most inventive in rock, creating new ways to align bass and guitar, and the drumming was simply amazing. So were Rod Evan's growling vocals.Sufficiently Breathless was after drum whiz Bobby Caldwell left. The bi-product is a solid hard rock album that uses folk, great playing, and all the other ingredients used in great hard rock albums in the early 1970s--back when they really knew how to make albums.On its own, this is above average and highly enjoyable, but it is not a revelation as was the first. Still, if you like early 70s solid rock, you can't do a lot better."
1,not really,"me and my buddies were there at Soap Creek all the time back then with Greezy Wheels and Marcia Ball and whoever, that is when somethin wasn't doin at Armadillo or Split Rail. this doesn't do justice to their original sound. too bad. fun then, dull now."
2,The title came from....,"Not too keen on this album, but I have a very soft spot for the last track, ""All the Way"". I'd recommend ""Cunning Stunts"", and ""For Girls...""But the title comes (I think) from an anecdote about Sir Noel Coward:Sir Noel is sitting in the drawing room with his niece, and on the lawn she sees two dogs, in the act. She asks him ""what are those dogs doing?"", and he replies:""The dog in front has gone blind, and the other dog has very kindly offered to push him all the way to St. Dunstans.""(St. Dunstans is a town in England.)"
5,Outstanding History!,"'Under the Cloud' portrays a fascinating and at times, intense, history of the development, testing and concerns regarding the early development of the nuclear weapons program in the US. A must for history buffs and for those interested in WMD related topics."
5,Great Book,"Have read it cover to cover a few times. This is a book that should be read in schools. A shocking and mostly untold portion of American history. To read about the extent of continental US Nuclear testing and the often covered up dangers (By the AEC) is a real eye opener. Many of the stories are told from the perspective of eye witnesses and include other bits of timely and relevant history that help to capture the moment. Pages of diagrams detailing the fallout patterns of many tests show that fallout was often scattered across the entire country (instead of just endangering the NTS area). A ""must read"" for anyone with an open mind towards real facts and American History."
3,Recipe miss print,The amount of salt (1 1/2 tablespoons)in the recipe Tuscan Sausage page 112 must be a miss print. It was too salty to eat. An expensive and time consuming disapointment. Other than that it is a good cook book.
1,"Great Restaurant, LOUSY book! Save your money.","Haven't been this disappointed since Obama was elected, frankly. I had hoped for a book that would give us recipes like the incredible dishes we enjoy at their restaurant. NOT happening here, that's for sure. It's like these 2 guys are trying to impress some elite, nose-in-the-air food columnist. The average Joe and Jane American hasn't ever heard of 80% of thesedishes. If you're looking for a good Italian cookbook, PASS ON THIS DOG."
5,Fallen Angel book,"Book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I haven't read it yet, but the book is in almost new condition."
1,AVOID!,Prohet starts off with a compelling argument. she then drifts off into her misguided view of spiritualism and inner power. She should test all her views against scripture and not take them out of context!
5,Remains of Giants Found,"If you do a search on giants you will see for yourself that giants really walked upon this earth. The bones of the giants have been found all over. In the mountains of West Virginia, many have been uncovered. You can find that particular page on the Steve Quayle Q files website."
1,Not for young Christians,"It is no secret that books on evil and the nature of spiritual warfare can be as dangerous as evil itself and this is a good example. The validity of the book of Enoch aside, the author of this book has no authority on this matter, does not cite sources when making important points and even goes so far as to alter Bible verses to prove her points. Any Christian who prays for discernment before they read this book and genuinely has faith in the power of the Spirit will see as I have that this is an evil book and should be read with the greatest scrutiny or not at all.Young Christians should not buy this book."
1,Cant stress enough,"Please don't take anything this woman says seriously. Just for fun is what I would call it. No not even that, Dangerous stupidity and conjecture for anyone who is uneducated I have read some of her stuff in the past and was in disbelief to hear her say that Jesus, God himself came to earth to learn from certain mystical religious groups in India and other places Give me a break. There are only three things God cant do, Lie. Die and Learn.Here again, more of the same BS."
2,Fallen Angels & the orgins of evil,I could learn all ahe had to say by just re-visiting the Bible. Nothing new or thought prevoking in this book
1,speculative,The interest here is in the actual Books rather than speculative opinions. These ancient Books were written for the few scholars rather than public mass consumption. A further limitation is the subject matter which narrows the readership still further from ancient Deism and Paganism. Salvific history is from the Creation. The Fall of Adam and Eve coupled with that of created eternal intelligence and Free Will. Salvific History its origins and consequences. The consistency of matter and material is also meant to be jigsawed into growing Dogmatic understanding and revelation. This is how the material is supposed to be used. The speculative sensationalism here displayed is phantasy in print!
2,"Unfortunately, Lacking","Overall I found this book disappointing. The basic premise of this book seems to be that the Book of Enoch was rejected/suppressed because it makes it quite clear that certain angels became fallen because of lust, not pride. And this is what was unacceptable to the church fathers who believed that angels where entirely spiritual and not capable of mating with anything physical. I think she makes her case well but I don't think this is much of a revelation if someone like me is already aware of this. The next and biggest disappointment was the translation of the Book of Enoch. Surely there must be a better translation in modern English available. Also the Biblical comparisons portion of the book didn't hold me at all. Great title, nice idea, but missed by a lot. Too bad."
4,very enlightening,This book was very informative and shed a different light on fallen angels. I really enjoyed it but found the author to be a bit too New Agey.
4,A good start off book,This was not one of my first books about the fallen angels or the war in heaven and the book of Enoch. I find it a good read even if it isn't the most accurate interpretation but it does make one ask the question of why the book was dropped by the early church fathers. I do have RH Charles Book of Enoch which is great. Elizabteh Prophet does a good job translating. It is still a good book to have.
1,pure baffles!,Not a good book I thought it was based on serious exegetical work but is more superstition than anything... could not even end it and I dump it!
1,"Hard to Read, Author is bias","I bought this book because I thought it would help me with an understanding of the Book of Enoch. I am so disappointed that I wasted my money on this book. It is hard to read and the Author has way too much bias in her own ""new age"" ideas."
4,satisfied,"Glad I bought it. I was a little leery of the author, however what I was looking for was the book of Enoch which was included in its entirety. So I guess I can live with a little commentary from a new age weirdo."
2,wasn't what I expected,"This book was not for me, to much religious undertone and sin in it. I wanted more historical aspect instead of the how we are all sinners, couldn't finish it & would of liked to get my money back but I threw away the receipt."
4,"Keep baby, throw out bathwater","Good translation of enoch from liberation perspective. I approached Clare with a grain of salt, and tried to consider her target audience when she was writing this intro to the text. If she is using metaphor to get accross her point then she is smarter than people are giving her credit, but then maybe I'm giving her too much credit. The interesting idea behind the book that no other reviewer mentions is its association of the watchers with the world's ruling elites, which Clare does touch upon to her credit. Credit also goes towards Clare for bringing the text to a wider readership. While they exist, you won't find any other copies of this text in a bookstore. Translation alone worth the small sticker price."
2,Was expecting something more historical,"I'm guessing I missed something in the book description, but I was expecting detailed information on the origins of the book of Enoch, how it was suppressed, by whom it was suppressed, and how it reappeared. It contains some of that information (less than 90 pages), but nothing I hadn't already found for free on the web. The bulk of this book is translations of the various Enoch texts along with other non-canonical texts. If you are looking for those texts, then it's a good buy. But if you are looking for more of the historical details of the Enoch texts, I would pass on this one."
2,Revisionist History,"Interesting from a historical standpoint but one familiar with the accounts of this period from documents and well-researched biographies will easily see how LBJ attempted to rewrite history in this book. Still fascinating if you're a fan of LBJ's drive to influence and create realities, and his skill as a masterful politician. Writing is choppy, more of a selling approach than a telling one, but I would recommend as a valuable read for those interested in presidential history. Of course I bought used for under $10; would not recommend at price point over $20."
5,A great horror short!,"This was full of suspense and intrigue! The star did a fabulous acting job and his facial expressions were great. There was no excess blood or violence, just a lot of good scary suspense. The film has a soundtrack that reminds me of Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and is excellent. Though pricey it's a movie worth watching time and again. Can't wait too see more in the future!"
5,GREAT BOOK! HAS ALL THE ANSWERS!,"Dan Gookin teaches in a non-threatening manner, and keeps up good humor in the meantime. It makes the learning process FUN, as well as simple. I especially like the way he throws in personal comments, as it saves me trial and error to learn the same outcome. This is definately an asset not found with other computer-book authors. It is evident that he uses computers, not just teaches them. Great book, easy to read, easy to use, and well worth the minimal investment."
4,Not as pictured,"I have yet to use the brushes, but thought I should warn future buyers that what you get is not what is pictured. The package only includes the 2 smaller brushes and the 1 small swab. None of the larger items are included, despite what the picture shows."
4,Actual interviews of people from the book Playing For Time,"I read the book Playing For Time and was delighted to see that there was a video of the actual people describing their experiences playing music while people were executed in Auschwitz. The video is an excellent documentary of the women's experiences. The book is more critical of the orchestra's leader, Alma Rose than the the women describe in the video. A new book entitled Alma Rose might add more information to the total story. The video is very interesting but has periods that are long and uneventful. This was a horrible time in our world's history. I am delighted that we have this record of the trials that these women experienced so that perhaps this kind of thing will never happen again. I recommend that you purchase this video along with the books, Playing for Time and Alma Rose."
2,Waste of money!,"I like Lowepro equipment and have quite a few of their items. So I was pleased to see that they had come out with a line of straps. I was particularly attracted to the non-slip grip feature. I just put the strap on my Canon 20D and am very disappointed. First, the strap is rather short with no capacity to make it longer. The worst part ... the non-slip grip feature is totally ineffective. It wouldn't stop anything from slipping off your shoulder. It doesn't even feel tacky. My old UPstrap is going back on the camera and this thing is going in the trash. What a waste of money! Why did I give it two stars? I don't even know!"
2,Can be described in two words... TO SHORT,After doing some research and reading the opinions I purchased this strap. As usual Amazon delivered the package in a flash. I own a Nikon DSLR and wanted a strap that can be removed when i'm using my holster case. When the package arrived I was impressed by the packaging. The strap looked great... seemed to be made well but as soon as I removed it from the package I noticed that it was short... real short... There is no way I could wear this any other way than around my neck. i had intentions of slinging it over my shoulder but it wasn't going to happen. The camera would end up in my armpit!And as the other reviewer stated... there is no room for adjustment.It would be nice if they sold some sort of extenders...To eliminate this problem Lowepro should include a picture of someone wearing this strap attached to a camera. It would have saved me a lot of trouble. Withing 5 minutes it was repacked for return.
2,Not useful at all,This camera strap will NOT stay up on your shoulder unless you prefer to drap it across your chest on the other shoulder. The product says it has non-slip fetaures but this is not the case. The so-called non-slip material is actually just a stringy-decorative-like pattern that provides no grip at all. I bought two of these...one for my camera (Nikon D200) and one for my father's camera (Canon XT) and the straps do not work for either of us. Our factory straps have better grip. These are already boxed up and ready to return. It's a shame really because it IS a very nice strap. Very comfortable and nice....just won't stay on the shoulder.
4,Works just as it claims!,"I find this strap to do just what it was intended to do ... for those who found it too short, they need only read the description ... it is intended for over the shoulder or around the neck. For slung across the body carrying, the S model is the one ... ""Designed for adventure photographers who wear their cameras sling-style across the chest, the straight Voyager S strap is also the perfect upgrade for photographers needing relief from those skinny, stock straps."" *caveat emptor* Latin for RTFA"
5,Lowepro Voyager C Camera Strap,Strap is much more comfortable then the Canon strap that came with the camera. It is well worth the money.
3,Comfortable but Bulky,The Lowepro Voyager C Camera Strap is comfortable around your neck. It's not itchy like the strap that came with my camera. It is rather bulky and I can't get it to fit into the Lowepro Slingshot 100 backpack while attached to the camera. So I detach it and store it in the side pocket until I'm going on a long shoot where it will be around my neck all day. I haven't had any problems yet with the quick clips that allow you to unhook the strap quickly but it still makes me nervous that my camera could be unclipped and fall crashing to the ground. I'd like to see this same strap without the quick clips. I also recommend buying a bag that is large enough to have the strap connected to the camera so you don't have to carry two straps around all the time.
3,Missing one major detail,"Ordering the Lowepro strap I figured it would be the perfect solution. The ""factory"" strap on my Sony was not wide enough and was constantly slipping off my shoulder. When I got the Lowepro it looked great except the little squiggly lines under the shoulder pad did not look very non slip. And they are not. It stays on my shoulder a little better than the original but still slipped off. I've used Lowepro for years and this was very disappointing."
5,Very Comfortable,I rarely put a camera around my neck. I hang it on my shoulder like a purse...and this is just right. And the CF pouch is handy to have. I'm spoiled for life.
4,The OTHER Cloud Atlas,"I bought this one by accident, thinking it was the Cloud Atlas the movie was based on. It is not that book. However, it is a fascinating read about a subject not many people know about: the war effort in Alaska during WWII."
5,"Up, Up and Away","I loved this book. It was haunting and moving, while at the same time telling a fascinating and exciting story from our country's wartime past. It's clear that the writer very thoroughly researched many elements of the novel, including its setting, Alaska, and the audacious attempt by Japan to float bombs to U.S. soil. But Callanan knows another subject even more intimately -- the human heart."
5,A great start for the author,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was initially attracted by the subject of balloon bombs and the Alaskan setting. The author's excellent research would have made this book worthwhile for just those two items; however, the plot and the characters are what made this such a treat to read. Callanan has done a masterful job weaving a rich tapestry of human emotion, religion, and mysticism against a fascinating historical background. I hope I do not have to wait too long for his next novel."
4,The Bookschlepper Recommends,"[Two books by the same title were published the same year; the other of this name went on to the best-selling list. I bought this one in error but, as it was about Alaska, I kept it and have now read it.] During WWII, the Japanese bombarded the US mainland with incendiary balloons. This campaign was not revealed until after the war. This is the story of a young man sent to defuse the bombs; he also needs to defuse his commander. A local Yup'ik woman fortuneteller is involved with both men as well as a Japanese spy. Lovely scenes of Alaska but also new information on the balloon campaign. Well-written and suspenseful, the book adds a hint of native spirituality to the mix and the story moves along nicely."
2,not for me,"This book did not catch my interest. After 30 pages, or so I closed the cover and stopped reading. Doubt I'll go to the movie."
3,The Cloud Atlas,"I saw the trailer for the movie, which inspired me to buy the book. I was dissapointed. Although I was intrigued by the story of the balloons, i didn't quite grasp the story line. It seemed jumbled and confusing. Especially Lily."
3,"Great story, mediocre dialogue, cultural stereotypes.","I read this book because it was recommended on NPR. The story itself is compelling and unpredictable. The beginning and the end move along quite well, but near the middle of the book the tale begins to ramble.The things I disliked about the book were the corny dialogue and the stereotypical, mysterious ""Asian Female"". Overall I'd recommend the book but the author should probably get a new editor."
4,loved this book,"A book with a priest as the central character is not one I'd usually pick. But Cloud Atlas was wonderful -- a great story that keeps you on edge, characters that capture your imagination as their stories unfold, plus the environment of Alaska, spirituality, and secrets. And I ended up really liking the priest!"
5,"A lovely, luminous book","I saw this book at the library and thought the title rang a bell; probably a confusion with the other Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell. What a beautiful, touching book! It is one of those too-rare novels that succeeds in creating a world I don't know and probably never will: small-town Alaska. It's not the Alaska of polar bears and igloos, or the Alaska of high mountain adventure, it's a very believable place, populated with interesting and unusual characters: the town drunk who is also a shaman, an aging priest who was once a bomb disposal expert, a beautiful half-Yup'ik woman who seems to have mysterious powers. The ideas of Christian and Yup'ik spirituality weave together, and the question of what is real and what is imaginary or faked floats through the story the way the balloons float across the barren landscape.A wonderful first novel. Here's hoping Liam Callanan gives us another story as good as this one."
3,Too introspective,"I though there was too much introspection and remorse in this. The story has interest, but I don't really think the author was able to make this as interesting as I would like. More action would have helped. Less mysticism as well. But, what do I know!"
1,The Cloud Atlas by Liam Callanan,"I thought the little-known fact of the Japanese Balloon bombing was very interesting, and I believe it alone could have supported the entire story line without all of the added mysticism, introspection etc. (Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction) Also the book contained way too many flashbacks (back stories). I was at times confused then bored by the 'First Person' presentation, however some scenes in the book captured my complete attention."
1,Not what I had expected,"I was disapointed by this book,the whole story seemed very intriguing. Imagine what it was like to be a young man, sent to the arctic for bomb disposal.The bombs are secret japanese balloon bombs, made by every japanese citizen and launched to land on the United States. Several of these bombs landed in California, the state of Washington and most in Alaska.But beyond this, the story is very dull. The main characterBeik, rambles on about a dying friend and about his fears of meeting up with a woman of japanese descent.He takes abuse from his surly superior officer. I could not finish this book becausethere was no point to it."
5,Can't wait for lawsuits,"I just want to say I hope lawsuits are continuing go be forthcoming on collusion to keep e-book prices so high.... I mean seriously, there's no production cost yet it costs the same for the paperback as it does for Kindle. NOT FUNNY."
4,Great Start! - What's Next?,Based on his background as a SEAL and a CIA person I took a flier on Captain Couch's book. I devoured it in two nights. Now I need to know more to make my attempts to protect my family more complete. Could the Captain expand his checklists (the most important part of the book) and go into more detail? Sure would help us landlubbers.
4,"So far, so good","The first unit did not work. Philips replaced it with no problem. The second unit works perfectly. It plays DVD's fron US and UK. I bought this player to watch ""The Professionals"" which are only available from the UK."
4,Very Good,"I really like my player, I was able to put in a region 2 DVD in and it played at once. The only thing that is a draw back is as others have said before me, the remote responeds slow. It looks very good with my other electronics and it plays all my DVD's including recorded ones."
1,Broke in 8 months,Stopped playing DVDs and skips CDs in 8 months of light use - 1-2 movies per months. Waste of money!
5,My first amazon purchase!,"It plays all region dvd's, burned dvds and it still works! I bought it back in 2007 and I still use it today. Well worth the purchase."
1,Buy it cheaper from Amazon instead,"This PHILIPS DVP 5140 is identical to the one amazon sells for nearly half the price atPhilips DVP5140 Multiformat DVD Player with DivX, MP3, Windows Media Support. Although it ships from Amazon in region 1 mode, its a cinch to switch it to multi-region mode following the instructions in one of the reviews there (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJZ8ZG9KQRL7/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) - I know 'cos I just bought one. I plugged one of my PAL region 2's in before changing anything and it gave me a region error, then I followed the instructions and my region 2 PAL DVD magically played, and on an NTSC TV too.I only plugged it in for the first time today, but it just worked first time with no set-up at all (other than the multi-region thing).Only down side so far is the delayed response to the controls, both remote and buttons - other than that, I'm totally pleased.1 star reflects the price of this page only - not the product."
3,Not bad,"Our last multi-region lived for so long, it was like losing the family cat when it died. This one's fine. My 2 peeves: (1) the buttons on the remote have to be pressed pretty hard and it has no ""eject"" button; (2) there's no S-video connection, which I was expecting (maybe I should have checked first), so I'm having to use the yellow/white/red wires, which produce slightly crappy results. On the plus side, it works (so far) and it's not too expensive."
1,Worst Electronic Device I've ever owned!!,"My BF bought this for me Christmas 2006 because I had just purchased a Philips 42"" LCD flat screen and needed a DVD player. I cannot say it ever really worked well. The remote was slow to respond, when it responded at all! It's just very slow in it's overall performance when you want it to do something. About 6 months into use, and rarely was it used, it really just stopped working. I would say it would play about 1 of every 2 DVD's we'd play. Now we're lucky if it even starts a DVD and when it does it doesn't play without breaking and pausing and stuttering. It's really, really, really bad! I would estimate I've used this DVD player less than 40 times in the past year. Unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. Of course I doubt we can get Philips to do anything about it. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!!"
4,Great DVD player for the price,"I really like this DVD player, as it plays most anything. The only flaw is there is no resume feature if it goes into sleep mode and shuts off. You have to start from the beginning and fast forward. The worst thing is the remote. The design is awful and causes you to move closer for it to work. No resume, and no open/close. But a good player for the money."
2,Cannot play DVD's from Israel,To my great disappointment this DVD player could not play many of my DVD's that were produced in Israel. Previous zone free DVD players I had could play these same DVD's. Beware Israeli users!
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I bought this CD based on these reviews. These must have been friends of this author because this CD has to be the worst meditation CD I have ever had. The first half is repetitious basically talking about watching your breathe and following it. Nothing else! The second part is no better. Let me just say, I don't write reviews and for me to write this review means it was a terrible CD."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I'm fairly new to the whole meditation scene but I loved this CD. There wasn't too much talk, no new age music, just simple calm instructions that really helped me focus. I definitely recommend it."
5,Just what I needed!,"I love this CD! It has 2 mindfulness meditations and 2 relaxation sessions on it, each about 15 minutes long. I find I mostly listen to the meditations, but the relaxations are good too. I'm one of those people who is always in my head - thinking, thinking, thinking. These short mediations are great for slowing down, breathing, and letting my mind relax and refresh. I am new to meditation and having these guided meditations is helpful. I like that there's no music or bells, just an extremely relaxing voice guiding me out of my head and into my body. I would definitely recommend this to folks who are new to mindfulness meditation, or anyone who wants a short, simple approach to relaxing."
4,Creating Calm,"I found this CD very easy to follow, and very helpful. It helps me relax when I am stressing out about things, and believe me, I've got some stress!"
4,Good if you are a novice,"If you're just beginning, this is more of a step-by-step that will get you set up in your meditation space. She takes you through the basics of getting comfortable, posture, how to relax, etc. Great for the novice. Honestly I prefer a little background music with my meditation, but that's me."
5,One of the Best!,"Rivka Simmons ""Creating Calm in Your Life"" is one of the best guided meditation CDs I have used - and I have listened to many! I own several copies, including one for my office and one for home. I have given ""Creating Calm in Your Life"" as gifts to many friends. The four 15 minute tracks are varied enough that I don't get bored, long enough that I truly achieve relaxation, and short enough that I am able to do one each day at work during a break. Those experienced in meditation as well as beginners will find this CD a help; I am now at the point where I can meditate on my own, but still enjoy using Rivka's CD when I meditate as a supportive presence. This CD is a great gift to yourself and others to enhance meditation, relaxation, and stress reduction."
3,a little too hippie for my wife,"she found the material good for helping her relax, and calm down when she feels stressed or nervous, but it was a little too hippie"
3,Tricky,"A first novel that holds your interest, but is sometimes too tricky for its own good. Holds promise for future stories."
2,Insulting my intelligence,"The story told is logically inconsistent in several areas, and the inconsistencies ruin the book. At one point in the book, detective Jack Paris follows the killer's white BMW, but apparently makes no attempt to get the license plate number. Shortly afterward, Paris is voyeuristically window-peeping at ""Pharaoh"" and bit character Andrea Heller, but is unable to get a glimpse of ""Pharaoh's"" face. Does he do anything to catch ""Pharaoh's"" attention to make him look at the window? Of course not! This is one stupid cop--but he's supposed to have solved eighty-one percent of the homicides he's investigated. The superhuman strength and stealth attributed to ""Saila"" are entirely implausible and unexplained, and the way women keep throwing themselves at Paris boggles the mind, especially since he's described as rather ugly, and something of a loser. Montanari gets two stars for style, but no points for a very weak story."
2,Hollow,"If you're on a plane, or the beach and want a page turner, Deviant Way will satisfy. If you're looking for depth, analysis, plot related research, or closure, you'll be sorely disappointed. There is no question that the book holds one attention, and Montanari deserves credit for that ability, but what he gains in style, he quickly loses in depth. There is no obvious research or attention to detail as in a Chricton novel. There is no analysis into the central characters' psyches as in a Harris novel and there is no closure or satisfaction in the end as in a Steven's novel i.e. ""By Reason of Insanity."" In short, as a fan of intelligent, creative, provacative, and well rounded mysteries, I was disappointed."
2,cheesy,"Lots of fake dialogue, wooden but physically beautiful characters, a shallow story posing as deep, powerful themes trivialized by moralizing and politically correct messages, SLOW pace, and finally, annoying relationships between characters (particularly the mother and the son). Can't you tell I loved this film? The most intriguing thing about this film is what it says about 1947 Ameri...that according to the Academy Awards it was the year's best film. A frightening thought."
4,Gift for mom,Sent mom this film for the holidays. She loved that it arrived quickly. John Garfield is a cousin of hers. Thanks.
5,See it through to the end...you'll be glad you did,"I agree with another review that the movie plods a lot in the first half. Someone could miss the first half hour or so and you could catch them up to the plot in less than 30 seconds.But wait it out, get up and make some popcorn or knit a sweater while you watch, and make sure you watch to the end, cause it's the last ten minutes that deliver that powerful punch.Pay close attention during the conversation between John Garfield and Dorothy McGuire, toward the end of the movie, and you will feel the movie hit home. You may see yourself in the dislikable character of Green's fiance, Cathy, all of a sudden and half to admit, I do that all the time. She forgot that there is a big difference between not liking racism, and doing something about it. Don't we all?Watching a movie like this is like this: ....yawn....stretch...yawn...POW!See it."
2,too much talking,"As my Grandson would say ""too much talking"". Prejudice, racism and bigotry can be preached against to the extent that the listner's eyes glaze over and ears go numb."
2,Save your Money,"A disappointment by any standard. I am a big of fan of this type of action Science Fiction books, but nothing in this book impressed me. Although the author Shepherd gave page after page of character background and thinking, he failed to generate any interesting characters. Even the action sequences left me cold. I suppose if you're blown away of the possibility of complex networking systems that can be hacked in less then one second then maybe this is the book for you. Or maybe you love to hear rambling philosophical musings of how earth cultures developed and adapted to the colonization of planets. I barely managed to finish the book and will not burden my friends with a recommendation."
2,Better Choices,"I recently picked up a copy of this book and there are better choices for romantic suspense. For the large part, the characters were downright annoying, they all deserved to remain alone. Though at times, the characters' revelations or actions had me laughing out loud because they were so stereotypical.The story has merit, but for me the hodgepodge of characters and the predictibility of the villan's identity all detracted from the story's goal of being suspenseful."
2,a little disappointing,"This was a very mediocre story with characters and plot that were totally unbelievable. Taylor did very little to make her appealing to anyone, let alone her new neighbor, Shane Donovan, 'the hunk'. At one point in the book, even Shane commented that Taylor hardly ever smiles. Is that supposed to make someone like you? There are other ridiculous circumstances in the book but to discuss these would divulge plot and I will not do that. There might be people who will enjoy this book. I am not one of them."
1,Corny and repetitive,"The editing in this book is terrible, just like in TRUST NO ONE. So many blatant errors it's just irritating.Repetitive phrases and descriptions, just like in TRUST NO ONE.Too many explanations points!!!!!Nothing about this book works well or is believable. The 'hero' thinks about his hard core life before yet melts like a marshmallow and falls in love instantly with the 'heroine', who I found silly and weak. Her feelings and thoughts are repeated so often it's hard to tolerate her.I usually keep the books I've read, but I'll sell this one because there is no chance I'll ever want to read it again.I apologize for the harshness of this review, I usually find something positive to say about an author's work. I just can't do that in this case.This is the second of Ms. Sawyer's books I've read. I have one more to go but hold out little hope of actually enjoying LADY KILLER.Shelley Dawn, author ofDark NightsandSweet, Sweet Jessie"
2,Questionable,"I haven't found any redeeming qualities yet, about 160 pages into the story. But off the top the premise that a dying woman would take the first person to present herself as her long lost daughter without any proof is far fetched. Guess she's not worried about fortune hunters and to heck with her kids that have built the business to what it is now. As for Shane, he doesn't seem to be too sharp at anything he is supposed to be an expert at. I have read 3 or 4 other books by Ms Sawyer and don't remember being so disappointed."
3,Hard to get through!,"I am such a fan of Meryl Sawyer's so I was disappointed to have such a hard time getting through Every Waking Moment. Even the main characters didn't interest me. Look for her older books, i.e. Hide Away."
3,dysfunctional,"Although I managed to finish the book, I found the cast of characters for the most part unlikable. Taylor, the heroine, spent most of the time in self doubt. The hero, Shane Donovan, although not well developed, deserved better. Taylor's family took the fun out of dysfunctional."
5,Wonderfully eclectic,"This is perhaps my favorite interior design book. Each space featured has a warm, unique and personal style that is not usually seen in the typical glossy interior coffee table books. Many of the homes are vacation or weekend cottages but they all share a feeling of great comfort and individual charm. I not only enjoy the beautiful photographs but the text reveals the personality of the owners and how the spaces reflect their lives. ""California Cottages"" brings a refreshing view of eclectic, somewhat bohemian living spaces that feel intimate and real. It's also nice to have a West coast perspective among the many interior design/style books that tend to favor East coast locales."
1,California cottages,"The decor was cold, not a warm cottage feel. Only liked some of the architecture and that's not why I purchased thus book."
4,"Not for Vegetarians, but GREAT","I'm not a vegetarian, but am married to and the mother of vegetarians so I do a lot of cooking to suit their needs. I think Gary is amazing from a nutritional perspective and find that the recipes in his books are delicious, not hard to prepare, and quick. While I agree that calling this book vegetarian is misleading, it is oriented toward vegetarians and very much toward eating healthy and well. I highly recommend his work."
1,This is NOT a vegetarian cookbook!,"This is NOT a vegetarian cookbook! I picked this up from the vegetarian section as a competitor's bookstore, and was deeply disturbed that both its placement and title were misleading. It is FULL of fish recipes. Where do fish grow--on fish trees? Don't buy this book if you are looking for a good vegetarian cookbook--there's plenty others out there for true vegetarians. Shame on Gary Null--this book smells fishy!!"
4,Great Purchase,I purchased this book after observing my Pastor using it during bible study. There's so much information and I recommend everyone to invest in one.
4,Great product - great price,NLE and DVD authoring. Editor is very well constructed; DVD Architect more tan satisfies my requirements.
1,Horrible!,"This is supposed to support HDV? Maybe unless the camcorder is a Sony! I connected my Sony HDR-HC3 and the program doesn't recognize it! I tried Pinnacle and no problem. If you own a Sony HDV camcorder and want to edit in hi def, you may want to avoid this program at least until Sony updates it to recognize its own camcorders."
5,Well worth it!,"While I am not as technologically savvy as my husband, I did buy this for both of us to use. We recently put together a hilarious montage of our Fourth of July party, complete with the 1812 Overture as background music...carefully timed with our fireworks, of course. Adding these effects, creating chapters, editing with transitions, adjusting sound...all were very user-friendly."
1,Don't Buy This Product if You Have Windows Vista,"I own four computers and have installed hundreds of software programs over the past several years. I have been trying to install this program for the past two days. Windows Vista tells me that I need to reinstall the program after uninstalling it. After doing so, I get the same message, trapping me into a circular hell that doesn't allow me to use the product. I believe it has to do with Sony's hyper-paranoia about copyright protection - I bought the Foo Fighters CD In Your Honor (which is on the Sony Label) and had similar problems rendering the CD unusable. I'll see how their customer support is, I'm not expecting much"
5,Perfect,I bought tis as a gift for my wife from our daughter. I put a picture of the two of them in it and she loves it. It is proudly displayed in our home.
4,stunning and cunning,"I had the vinyl version back in the mid 70ies, I always liked this group. I like the usage of viola, flute and guitars, keyboards. Jazzy-folk-rock with quirky lyrics."
2,Overproduced,"I am a fan of Caravan, especially their first three albums, but this later album, Cunning Stunts, I found overproduced, overorchestrated and totally lacking the charm of such albums as In the Land of Grey & Pink. There seems to be too much Mike Wedgwood here, where he sings on most of the cuts here, such as the ever mushy ""Lover"". David Sinclair is on this album, but you hardly even notice him at all, it's almost like he didn't care at this point, which is even less surprising since he left after this album to be replaced by Jan Schelhaas. Caravan had made some of the greatest Canterbury prog albums out there, but sorry to say, with Cunning Stunts, the band messed up here. Don't make this your first purchase. Try an earlier release first, like In the Land of Grey & Pink."
2,Could do better.,"This is definately not one of Caravan's better efforts. This mid-seventies recording presents some of Caravan's weakest compositions, still the musicianship is up to their usual level of excellence. There are two cuts in particular ""Lover"" and ""Welcome the Day"" that are particularly weak and actually sound out of place on a Caravan record. Give this one a pass and opt for Waterloo Lily, For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night or In the Land of Grey and Pink."
2,2.5 stars,"One of Caravan's weaker moments. Couple of decent songs, some weak ones and the worst they've penned-Lover. Some interesting moments but not many. Save your money as this is not worth owning. Turn to In The Land Of Grey And Pink, Waterloo Lily, If I Could Do It All Over Again I'd Do It All Over You or even, For Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night...Simon"
4,Wider please,The cushion I like very much. I can easily spot clean it and it dries quickly after a rain shower. My only minor critique would be... it could be a bit wider and fit the chase lounge a bit better.
5,These cushions are very plush & comfortable,"Very happy with these 2 cushions. Durable, sun proof, waterproof, and o yess, very comfy!!These are the color of red dirt or brick and don't show the color of dirt we have here."
1,NOT WELL SUITED FOR THE STRATHWOOD CHAISE,"these are nice enuff on their own, but they are WAY TOO thing and small for the Strathwood Chaise lounge frame.Amazon should not bundle them.You will be A LOT happier with the Strathwood Lounge cushion in Pearwood.Have a great summer!"
2,dye problem,"Have had this for several months, and today the green dye came off on my husband's swim suit and on his feet. Has anyone else had this problem?"
4,as expected,"seemed comfortable and expected. it is new so i do not know how long it will last. now i have had is some months. it began to deteriorate rather quickly, the color coming off on our clothes etc, had to cover the cushion with towels to sit on it. it is now tattered and coming apart. do not recommend the cushions. the chairs are holding up well and comfortable"
1,Don't buy these!,There is something very wrong with these coushions. The blue dye runs all over everything. I've tried to rinse them off with hose but it never stops. There is also some kind of manufacturing problem. When you pick them up your fingers go right through the fabric and cause holes. Very frustrated by this purchase.
1,Don't buy. Dye/powder coming off!,"Pretty much what the previous reviewers have stated, after a while blue dye starts to rub off on everthing! Not happy at all. Love the chairs, hate the cusions."
1,Absolutely Unequivocally HORRIBLE!!,"I purchased/received these cushions on or about April 20, 2011, and by June 30, 2011, they were already DISINTEGRATING! Literally. I realized it when I pushed my finger against one of them to wipe something off, and my finger went right through. Then I examined the other three that I purchased and realized they were ALL falling apart in the same manner. Moreover, the blue cover had literally turned to blue dust that got all over everything! DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THESE!!"
3,Okay cushion,"Cushion itself was comfortable, but as it was out in the elements the dye began to seep out. As a result, when you sit on the dry cushion, you come away with blue skin. Didn't make it through the summer."
5,Beautiful.,"This album is a brooding, haunting cacophony sounds. It's beautiful. It does sound a bit like the Beatles' psychedelic music; especially ""Drag,"" which sound reminds me of ""All Across the Universe."" But they have their own unique sound, and its good music to listen to when you're in a 'soul-searching' mood. My favorite lyrics: ""maybe someday I'll find that one thing that makes me feel like I want to feel."""
2,Decent group but CD doesn't match their live show,"I just recently saw this group in concert with Placebo and Stabbing Westward in Toronto recently and these guys rocked. Other than Stabbing Westward, they were the best group on the stage. Huge guitars, heavy bass, and catchy lyrics. I was instantly hooked so I bought their CD. After playing it wondered what happened to this group. There are only 3 good songs on this album (Freezer Burnt, Maybe Someday, and Anthem) but the rest of the CD is filled with annoying high pitched vocals and a too mellow and sappy sound. This group shows a lot of potential but falls short. If you want to hear good music listen to them live don't waste your money. Maybe Flick will relize this before their next album."
2,not 100% cotton as stated,"Stated 100% cotton, but actually is 10% spandex. Other than that a nice bra, however if I ordered the same bra again I would order a larger cup size."
5,Shorty and sweet,This is a great starter book if you are thinking about starting a writing career of any sort. She has some great tips and ideas of how to get those ideas on paper and they are written with Janet's trademark snarky witt.
5,Fave writer,Janet Evanovich is one of my wife's favorite writers. She is writing her first book so I thought this will help inspire her.
4,Informative,"Good for learning some of the habits of prolific writers. Following Evanovich's schedule would enable one to turn out a lot of words, even if they're not good ones."
3,"Good, but not the best","Best selling author, Janet Evanovich, explains the secrets of writing and getting published. The fact that J. Evanovich is a best selling author does add to the credibility of the book, but the advice in it is nothing new. Considering that I've read a lot of ""how to write"" books, this one actually held less writing help then most others. However, this book did have a lot of help in the publishing department. It had a real example of a query letter, and the advice on how to get published seemed more complete then those in most other books. All-in-all, this was nothing new, and there are better books out there when it comes to writing help, but it was a quick read."
4,"If You Like Evanovich, You'll Like This Book","I've been a fan of Janet Evanovich since her first Stephanie Plum novel. I like her breezy and humorous style, and it's in great evidence in How I Write.There's nothing new or earthshaking in this, and there are better books on writing. But it covers a lot of bases and does so painlessly. The book is, unlike many books on writing, eminently readable.I couldn't help feeling uplifted and motivated by Evanovich and Yalof's book. And while there was no new material, the reminders of certain techniques were helpful...and frankly, any writing book that motivates you is going to get a high rating in my worldview."
1,Ultimate in Irony,"This book is the epitome of irony.It is akin to Kevin Costner writing a book on how to act.What I wouldn't give to read a book by a writer that speaks to things that matter, with raw honesty and real people living their own lives, instead of today's cartoon cut-outs that speak sitcom-ese or the equally idiotic pseudo-mafioso clowns trying to be the next Godfather. Where, where, where are the great writers of today?"
5,Helpful - and loads of fun to read!,"Evanovich's signature style shines through in this playful, humorous, and extremely useful writing guide. ""How I Write"" is almost as much fun to read as her Plum novels themselves!Lots of specific examples round out Evanovich's personal advice for writing, revising, and publishing a first book. ""How I Write"" has plenty of relevant details without overwhelming or bogging down the reader - instead, it inspires the novice author to take the plunge into professional writing.Question-and-answer format is fun and easy to read, and book organization is logical and linear. A table of contents provides the road map, but ""How I Write"" would have benefited from a detailed topic index in the back.If you are interested in writing and publishing contemporary fiction, don't miss this quick, fun, and useful read!"
2,Nothing new here,"The book is designed for someone who has never written anything. If you've even read one issue of Writer's Digest you will have everything shared in this book. If you really want to write mysteries Hallie Ephron's book ""Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel"" is much better. If you are a novice writer completely ignore the formatting information Evanovitch gives in the back of the book. 14 pt Genva with 1.5"" margins is NOT the industry standard. 12 pt Courier or Times New Roman with 1"" to 1.2"" margins is. If you're a bestseller you could turn in a manuscript in crayon and they would still publish your book, but unknowns don't have that luxury. If you just want to read it for fun, it's an easy read, but if you want real information look somewhere else."
3,THERE ARE WORSE BOOKS,"HOW I WRITE is fun to read but it doesnt reveal anything that isnt in every other how-to-write book. Evanovich gives you the basic stuff without disclosing anything that makes her writing special. I didnt expect she would.Most how-to-write books dont really explain how to write beyond the general prescription, which is lacking in good details."
4,Excellent!,"Incredible Author, insightful advice. Not a dumb-down version of a ""how to write a book."" Recommend it for Evanovich fans and for those pursuing writing fiction."
1,Rip-O-Rama,"I rented this thinking as others have, that there would be some good tactical warfare.There is none so I was disapointed, its actually kind of funny in a weird way (the lead actor looks scared 90% of the time-guess he knew that the script blows chunks) and he blinks every time he pull the trigger. Perhaps he should lay off the coffee and work at the 7-11.Bad story waek acting and generally a true ripoff."
1,Navy SEALs Rip Off... Literally,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever scene. Scenes from ""Navy SEALs"" were literally taken and put into this movie. The actions seens did not even look realistic, the plot was lame, and the broadway cast of ""Rent"" could have done some better acting in an action flick. If you want to see a Spec Ops action flick, rent or buy Navy SEALs. Don't waste your money with this damn movie. I feel like going back to Blockbuster and demand my money back. However, it might be even more embarassing showing them that I rented this movie."
1,Worst Military Movie Ever,"To be honest, this is the worst military movie I have ever seen my entire life. It is true that politic can screw up the lives of soldiers, but the whole story in this movie doesn't make any sense. As a U.S. Army ROTC cadet, this movie is disgraceful to the U.S. Army Ragners. And I cannot believe this movie is copied and pasted from other movies such as ""Red Heat""."
1,Not the pictured item.,"I looked long and hard to find the older model of the Kun shoulder rest with the real rubber feet made from rubber hosing. I have read reviews of the plastic-rubber hybrid that Kun switched to some time ago and wanted to avoid the problems they mentioned (and now that I have seen it up close I can understand - this stuff just isn't that grippy).So, as I just mentioned, the shoulder rest I received is the newer plastic-footed kind. I sent a complaint about this through Amazon's feedback system and the seller told me that the photo is selected by Amazon.com or something. They said ""the picture is pulled from an Amazon image previously loaded by another vendor and is NOT our picture.""Even though this is Amazon's fault, apparently, Amazon.com customer service says this is the proper venue for complaints, so here I am, & still looking for an older style shoulder rest. (I guess this is also a general disappointment in Kun as a company, too.)"
4,Cheap yet very effective,"When I tried this shoulder rest, it was very snug.The only way this would slip off your violin is if you didn't iton your violin all the way.This is a good shoulder rest, for those who are looking for an economic shoulder rest."
4,Read The Fine Print!!,"I can't in all honesty tell you how this component performs, because I failed in something basic-I didn't read the fine print. This card uses more power than the rest of my system combined, and my power supply was just not up to the job. Now I am waiting for a new power supply (which is running the total price up another $84!)and I have to ask myself why didn't I just buy something cheaper?At any rate, before I spend this much on a component again I will investigate for 'hidden charges'!"
4,"Excelent Card, 0 Noise and Great Graphics!","The card is really amazing, great price, and performance, but in some games news like CRYSIS run in a low settings, is a best option for gamming and business."
3,not bad but was expecting more,"I bought this card replacing my Nvidia 7300, of course the card a lot faster but was kind of expecting more. is a good card for the price but if you want to play the latest games with full dx10 you better get a 8800gts. One of the reason that I decided for the 8600 gts was that it supports DX10. But the truth is that DX demads more from your video card and for me, the 8600 gts is still short. so at the end you will end up playing with DX9c because of performance.I hope this one gets resolved with better drivers"
1,Another MUST read,"Anyone who is interested in complementary medicine or natural medicines and cancer treatment should get John Boik's new book, Natural Compounds in Cancer Therapy. John presents the scientific evidence for all natural compounds, gives excellent educational backgrounds on vitamins and natural compounds, and is unfailingly honest. His work is a superb reference guide, as well as clarifying what may or may not be helpful. I have no connectio n with him, other than his help in curing my best friend of Stage IV non small cell lung cancer. This is not ""alternative"" medicine fru-fru."
5,Great Devotional!,"I've found ""The Lord Will Answer"" an excellent devotional based on Scripture using the structure of Luther's Small Catechism. For many years I've heard it mentioned that the Small Catechism can be prayed as well as memorized. Now I see how true that is! I would highly recommend it for personal, devotional use."
1,Watch out for these glasses,BE CAREFUL WITH THESE THINGS! I just got this set and I have already had 4 of them explode on me. No joke I was rinsing one out under some lukewarm water and boom it blew up in my hand. I had three others blow up while they were just sitting in the dry rack air drying. I'm afraid to put any fluid into them now as the last thing I want is to go to take a sip of beer and BOOM! Glass everywhere and I've spilled my beer :(
4,Beer Glasses they are!,How in the world can you review an empty beer glass? I just went and filled one and lo and behold they hold beer!
1,Disappointing quality,"I have ordered 2 or 3 sets of these glasses, and each time something was wrong. Twice, there were scratches in the glass (long and noticeable). Another time, there was a large ""wrinkle"" in the glass, also very noticeable. As I am giving these for gifts in sets of two, they are unable to be used. Will have to search for better quality."
1,"Very poor packaging, received broken and scratched glasses.","I bought this set of 12 glasses, and only 8 survived the shipping...nothing protected the glass from other glass, only bubble wrap around the entire set of 6 in 2 boxes. Those glasses that made it, most of them have scrapes around the bubbled section...I'm very disappointed not enough care was taken."
5,Great Shape,"The book was in great shape and has been really helpful in my research this summer. The book arrived before the expected shipment date. Great Shape, Great Service."
3,Good text - not recommended for commercial labs,"This is a fine introductory text for proper laboratory notebook/logbook entries. As our lab is working in environmental testing, I found the book not very useful for commercial testing labs that are working in a regulated environment. The book is certainly excellent with respect to research work and patent development protection."
5,timeless guidance,"Glad the book is still easily available. Great, timeless guidance and review text for lab folks of all levels."
5,Horace Andy,"this 2cd album anthology is and it is sad to say but, the only work that is worth getting when it comes to horace andy. his smooth voice tingles my spine true to the culture of reggae. Get this if your looking for some roots reggae, one of the best. Get it when its cheap its now for less than $10 these albums by trojan are rare and are no longer in print, if you can find a import from u.k. for cheaper get it, those are worth a lot more than u.s. versions. thats only if you intend to resell it. do not pay more than $15 for this item. one love."
4,Hmm... Slightly Dissapointing.,I have to say that I looked forward to this DVD alot. I was slightly disapointed with Yomiko's voice. I know that it has been a few years but what is with the british accent. I am hopeing that it just her depression over her current situation and it gets better as the series progresses. Over all this series keeps you on your toes. It is very enjoyable.
5,Lo mejor de Paloma - The best of Paloma,Your not a true fan if you don't own a copy of this cd + dvd!!! Es un cd que para cualquier fan de paloma que se respete debe tener!!!
4,Retire a millionaire in le$$ than 147 years,"This is an easy,fast read and gives lots of examples of how compound interest works for you.It inspires you to believe it is never too late to start saving."
1,Forget It,"I quit on page 2. The hero is African-American. He is National Security Advisor to the President. He is sober, driving within the speed limit in his BMW. Two white DC policemen stop him -- and call him the N-word, the MF double-word and like that. Gimme a break.1. I doubt there are two white policemen in DC much less two driving together.2. Why doesn't he flash his credentials? Are these birds really going to hassle the National Security Advisor??This scene is nonsense. Why bother to read more?"
4,"Cute, fun film","I picked up this film for a dollar, not knowing if it would be any good. It was cute, fun, and clean in a thirties sort of way. It was much in the same style as the books by Carolyne Keene, with Nancy and her convertable roadster. If a viewer is or was a fan of the original Nancy Drew series, or is a fan of thirties film efforts, this is worth having."
4,"Nancy Drew, Reporter meets Hitchcock - well, kinda....","Nancy Drew, Reporter (1939) is a very good entry in this series. I watched it for the first time the other night and was amused by two scenes with Psycho references. Since the movie was made over 20 years before Hitchcock's masterpiece, the scenes are pure coincidence, but worth sharing...during the movie, one of the characters appears in drag looking eerily like Mother Bates! and in another scene, which takes place on a rooftop, there is a sign in the background advertising the Bates Hotel! I had to smile. Check it out."
4,Good Old Nancy,"The movie is played mainly for comedy; there is neither hide nor hair of Bess and George; and why on earth would they call him TED Nickerson?All in all, this movie does depict the fun and excitement that you would relate to any Nancy Drew book. Nancy comes across young, smart and with a lot more opportunities than anyone has a right to expect. But she's not spoiled and you can't help falling in love with Bonita Granville's portrayal of the heroine.The movie is short, fast and funny and will appeal to children and younger adults."
5,A Digital Masterpiece,"Marble is a dynamic album that truly rocks and rolls! Building on a strong foundation of acoustical roots, Johnny Ireland ventures into the digital realm to ceatively expand his art. From haunting ballads to more lusty grooves, this album has a well-rounded flavor that is sure to satisfy your musical palate. I suspect we've only just begun to hear what this artist is capable of and I for one am looking forward to his next project."
5,get this album,"I went out to coffee last night and ended up hearing one of the most amazing voices ever. I only heard two of her songs and that was enough to get to to go buy her album ""Live"". Colleen Sexton has got a great voice. She writes some powerful songs and does great covers."
5,Bright Eyes,Excellent movie with the song the girls were dying to hear. Bought this for my granddaughters to have them see the production.
5,My Granddaughters loved it!,"My Granddaughters absolutely loved this movie!And now they know where the song ""On the good ship lollilop"" came from!"
5,Bright Eyes,"A Shirley Temple classic that i bought for my Granddaughter, who would dance and sing along with Shirley. Good buy."
5,Shirley Temple Is An All time Favorite,She is one of the Best Child Stars ever to Be Staring in a Classic Movie even if your are 5 to 55 you're Never too old to Enjoy Shirley Temple.
5,Gosh O Gee Look at Shirley,This movie was definitely to say one of her best movies. You can't help but cry when Shirley's mom cracks up and goes to heaven and the parents meet up there together.Shirley is in a 3 waycustody battle & she wants them all. Jane Withers (Joy) is a hilarous addon to the movie and she doesn't have any compassion for anyone not even her own two parents and not even't dear little Shirley.When Shirley hears the parents of Joy talkin about her harshly she decided to run away.......
5,hot like fire,if you know anything about real island music this is the cd for you. the guitar is a master and hes white! go figuar
1,Not so great,This is not the same as their other clear spray.. It's basically a milky lotion in a spray bottle. I would not suggest it.
2,"Not a spray lotion, just sunscreen in a spray bottle.",I didn't think it was clear that this product was simply regular sunscreen dispensed from a spray bottle. I've used a spray Coppertone sunscreen before and assumed this was the same.
3,Dry Rituals Anacronistic Vision,As far as books concerning the Celts published by Llewellyn go this is one of the best. The MacCrossan has a good basic knowledge of Celtic linguistics and history but he treats the cultures as if they were things of the past. His rituals are also so dry that the ancient filidh and druídh would probably cry. I'd suggest that you pick up a copy of _the Apple Branch_ if you can find it. When entering into Celtic Paganism it's important to remember that the Celts are still posses living cultures and languages.. MacCrosan really seams to forget that.
3,a point to note,"I am only passingly familiar with MacCrossan's book, but it does appear to have certain fundamental flaws- such as dry ritual scripts, and an anachronistic focus on reconstruction rather than living Celtic tradition. But as far as I know, and according to Celtic scholars who have read the book, the basic historical information is for the most part correct. I'm posting this to balance out the previous review- anyone who considers Cunningham a reliable source cannot possibly know what they are talking about."
4,Great story,I tend to not finish books that do not hold my attention. I finished this one and will read a second. I love murder mysteries that have a wit about them!
5,Extremely helpful for improving focus,Sri Siva has a lovely voice for chanting and certainly a deep connection to the ancient mystical sounds of India which he is sharing with the West. Ara Kara is a very charged mantra to help one really focus meditative energies and become more productive. Sri Siva's explanations are very lucid and one can use the chant in the background while doing tasks like dishwashing or use the meditation while sitting still.
3,"Interesting, but Wayne Dyer is easier to use and understand.","Baba Sri Siva may have inspired Wayne Dyer but he could also learn a little from the student is this case. Dyer uses the principles that Siva espouses in this recording, but Dyer knows that you need to teach the lesson then get out of the way so the student can use what you've just taught. I found the meditation portion, which was my prime reason for getting this product, was not useful when you actually tried to meditate using the recording. I did find what Siva was teaching helpful but I found myself wishing for the sound of the meditation rather than the teacher. Interesting and informative, this in not a useful background for active meditation."
