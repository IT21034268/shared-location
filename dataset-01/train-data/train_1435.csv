3,Smackdown vs Raw 2008,"This is my first wrestling game. The only realy issue with this game is that while you are able to create 30 Divas or Superstars after about 9 or 10 the game will not load on the PS2. I don't know if it is my PS2.(Purchased in 2001) or weather this is fairly standard no matter PS2 year purchased you have. Also would like to have created divas in their birthday suits, know what I mean Vern. But the less clothes for the divas is allright to. The game will not let Melina be controlled by a real person and lose her belt. I tried four different times and won each time but the belt never changed hands. There is no Bra and Panties match. If there is it must be locked or I could not find it. Also could not create my own Championship belt without ""Paying"" for it. That's just plain wrong. However I enjoy it and give it 3 thumbs up."
3,"Great songs, not the best compilation","This album is supposed to be a ""Greatest hits"" collection, but incredibly, some of her biggest HITS are not included. ""Tu angel de la guarda"", ""Con los ojos cerrados"" and ""Me siento tan sola"" are some of Gloria Trevi's most important titles, and do not appear on DE PELOS! On the other hand, other tracks that never reached the HIT status do appear here, like ""Satisfecha"" (Gloria's cover of Rolling Stone's ""Satisfaction""), ""A gatas"", ""Si me llevas contigo"" or ""Ella que nunca fue ella"". Another thing I dislike about this album is that Trevi's debut single, ""Dr. psiquiatra"" only appears as a very bad remix, the original and much superior version was not included. Gloria is a very talented, unique and controversial artist, and if you want a real taste of her ""greatest hits"" get ""RECUENTO DE LOS DANOS"" or ""ELLAS CANTAN ASI"" instead of this."
3,MP3 Player,"I purchased this for my wife because she wanted one to use while exercising. She rarely uses it. I had to set it up and I really cannot stand using the windows media player to manage music. This was purchased because it has a radio, which works decent, picks up TV signals and plays MP3 of course while fitting in you pocket. I think it was cheaply made but good enough for the purpose it is intended for."
3,Disappointed,I ordered this Sansa Express after I already owned one. It was for a friend to use on trips together. When I add the expansion card and attach it to my computer the expansion card is not seen. The intenal memory works fine.Bob Dettling
2,defective device,i thought this would be a refreshing product to purchase after hearing about how ipods tend to die alot..and for the price and cute color- mine is pink- it seemed like a great buy. With the usb stick ending i didnt even have to deal with cables. But the problem was that it is supposed to hold 500 songs wma format- and for some reason it would not take more than 110. I continually have emailed the sandisk customer service- the past 5 days and they keep telling me to download things- which haven't helped. It's junk and i would not recommend purchasing inferior products like this one. Total dissapointment.
3,Mixed thoughts,"Cons: I bought this for my 8 year old and it is too complicated for her. Sometimes for me, too! Audio books downloaded from the public library get inconveniently filed with songs (whereas books downloaded from paid sources get conveniently filed in audiobooks), the display goes off (to save battery power) way too quickly, the volume is not as high as I'd like it and rewinding can be onerous. You really need to sit down and dig into the instructions before using it, a minus for impulsive,""open-the-box-and-use-it"" types like me.Pros: It is small, cheap and it does the job."
3,Don't bother if you use Vista & ITunes,"I purchased this for my son and of course didn't even think that ITunes wouldn't be compatable (MP3 va MP4). Not only did ITunes not work, but later I was told that this unit is not yet compatible with Windows Vista. I'll stick with Ipod for use of convenience if nothing else!"
1,Won't power on anymore!,"I've owned this player for about 2-3 weeks and have been generally very happy with it... Until today that is... Like some other have reported my player will no longer power on. In my case it is not due to overcharging, I was using the player and it was almost fully charged. Just in case I just tried to charge it, but it won't even begin to charge.The problem happened when I chose a song to play, instead of the song starting to play normally it suddenly started playing the music funny (like super fast-forward) then it powered off and won't turn back on.I didn't buy a protection plan so I guess I am going to have to contact Sandisk for support. I didn't see anything on their website about this issue.Before this problem I would have rated this player with 4 stars"
2,"Great, until it died after 30 days.","I really liked this little DAP, especially the OLED display and microSD slot.It did tend to lock up sometimes. Plugging it into a USB port on my computer always brought it back to life. The other day it suddenly stopped playing music and powered off by itself. I turned it back on and it got halfway through ""refreshing database"" and turned off. I tried the USB trick and hard resetting but alas, she was gone for good. Since it was on the last day of the 30 day BB return policy I brought it back for a refund."
3,You Get What You Pay For,It serves its purpose as it plays MP3s and holds a relatively large amount of audio files. The main problems I have with this is that it doesn't automatically go to the last file that was played before turning the MP3 Player off and the forwarding and rewinding of large audio files is very slow. I should have just paid a little bit more for one of the better models.
4,Excellent for the price,"I trust the SanDisk name. Their products are excellent, especially their flash drives. I was impressed by the quality of this product considering the price and its size. It's not flimsy and recordings are very clear. I wish I had bought the 2GB instead of the 1GB. Unfortunately you can't record from the FM radio to the external flash memory."
1,It just died after only 3 months...,"...what more can I say, other than it wasn't that great while it was working. The device wouldn't power on even with a full charge. Sandisk support could not explain why this would happen and offered no real help.Buyer beware - don't waste your money.I'll be ordering a second generation Zune later today."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"I loved it the first day ! Then it locked up on me and I couldnt get it to do anything. It finally fixed itself and the next day while charging it it locked up again. It just froze ! The display says "" connecting "" and there it stayed until the battery died and I wasnt able to do anything else with it. JUNK ! JUNK ! JUNK !I tried to contact Sandisk....yeah right they were no help !"
1,Good for 1.5 Years,"I purchased the Sansa Express in Oct '07. After 1.5 years of light usage, the device is now unusable -- specifically the volume increase button ""shuts off"" the device. I have no means of increasing the volume! Multiple installations of the updated ""firmware"" have not resolved the malfunction.When the Express was working, the sound quality was good, the device easily slips into a shirt pocket."
1,I've gone through 2 of these,"Beware of this player! I loved this thing until it broke (wouldn't power on). I loved the size, the fact that it had a full-on USB connection, the PM tuner. So, I returned it and bought another... mistake! My second one lasted 2 days. I didn't abuse it or anything, so I can't help but think it must be an issue with the Sansa Express product line (or perhaps a bad batch?) Someone else mentioned that you can ""overchage the unit"" on their review. This sounds bizarre. I can't imagine that this can be true, but either way, this unit is not the one for me. I'm returning the second and going with something else..."
2,"I hate to agree with the nay sayers, but...","My Sansa Express lost its power within a few days of taking it out of the box, even though I charged it as instructed. The techie at Sandisk said it was defective and so I could exchange it. With my new player, I cannot get the firmware loaded or get the player to show as an E: drive. After reading the recent comments above, I've decided to return it to the store before my 30 days expire. What a shame! I REALLY wanted to like this product and avoid the iPod craze."
2,serious waste of money,"Overall this is pretty poor product, most importantly I found the volume extremely low. This is really their entry model with a face lift. The controls are poorly designed. The software isn't good and most importantly, the sound quality was horrificGood- Small & Light- Expandable memory- Battery lifeBad- You'll never want to use it since the on board software is difficult to navigate- Badly designed. The little cover piece with string is annoying. The controls are flimsy and outdated. Not very well thought out and very cheap feel.- Sound quality and volume are poor.- You can't see the LCD outside"
1,Junk,"This product has great potential, but it just doesn't cut it. The most annoying problem is that it doesn't remember where you left off when you pause or when you skip songs (yes, I upgraded the firmware). If you're 30 minutes into a 1 hour podcast and you accidentally advance, forget it. Game over. Avoiding Pause and using the off button actually maintains your place, but what a hassle. Finally, the whole thing kicked the bucket after about 6 months. I loved the fact that it had an FM transmitter. Sad, definitely sad.I've found a better solution to this piece of junk: stick with the iPod shuffle and use Media Monkey. Works great."
1,"Very, very frustrating","The product details claim that with very little charging time the battery lasts for 15 hours. In fact with 8 hours charging time the battery lasts for 5 minutes.The product claims in it compatible with audible. Not True!!!The menu two or three slots each time you try to move one and for some inexplicable reason when you want to listen to music, or audio it keeps jumping back to record voicenotes.I am NOT a satisfied customer!"
2,Perfect example of you get what you pay for,"I am currently on my second Sansa Express 1 GB because the first one locked up all the time.It took quite a while arguing with Sansa support explaining to them that their piece of equipment was not functioning normally. After sending in my ""broken"" express, two weeks later antoher brand new one arrived in the mail.I was fine with the whole ordeal until this morning my new Sansa Express locked up just like the old one where the opening ""Sansa"" screen hangs and the device will not turn all the way on. I have been able to kick it out of this hang by plugging it into a USB device, very inconvienent if you don't have one around.Anyway, I'm out - after their painful customer service and half-functioning equipment - I will never buy Sansa again."
4,Good product if you can do a little geekwork,"The product is pretty good but the firmware may need updating. Otherwise they have a tendency to brick. Adding to the fun, the firmware installation program does not run under Vista (Vista is mostly a story of lost capabilities) but does run fine under XP. That said, once you fix it, it works fine. Mine is almost 2 years old now."
4,Sansa Express,"I really like the ease of this mp3. I had no trouble downloading the music and books to it. The sound is great too. The only problem I have is the neck-strap is connected to the USB cover, which comes off. At this point, it has been fine but I am worried that later on down the road, it may fall off and I will lose the whole thing."
1,MicroSD does not work,"Liked the product until tried to add 2GB Kingston MicroSD card. Player became unstable, and extra memory was undetected. Web discussions indicate others have had same problems. Very disappointed."
2,Great until it stopped working,"As others have indicated, this seemed like a great little MP3 player until it wouldn't turn on a week after I got it. Other annoyances include the inability to delete tracks or recordings without being hooked up to a computer, and one music-listening session where all the music would be garbled until you hit the back button to start the songs over. Not sure if new firmware would have fixed the latter problems, but I don't want to spend my time hunting down updated firmware for a $60 device."
3,"Sleek, slim, but awful shuffle support","I purchased my Sansa Express last week as I was looking for a very compact flash-based music player with a screen. The Sansa Express was the only one that really fit the bill.I'm very happy with the size and storage capacity. I'm supremely annoyed by the shuffle support. One of the other reviewers mentioned it as well, but it's worth repeating: the Shuffle functionality is terrible. If you play all music and turn shuffle on, you'll wind up hearing the same subset of songs over and over again. I have 1GB of music loaded up, but keep getting the same 15-20 songs played. As far as I can tell it has something to do with powering off the unit in the middle of the playlist. When powered on it doesn't pick up where it left off: rather, it goes back to an earlier portion of the song list.It's a shame, because otherwise it would be such a great player :("
5,Excellent product...so far,"This is really a neat and useful device for the price. The customer service was good too. As its a recent purchase, I can only hope it will continue to work well. Will keep u posted on its durability/longevity.Added: July 12, 2009. My Sansa is still working. Love it."
4,Great for the Price,"The Sandisk is a great MP3 player for the price. It has all the features for which I was looking. Its sleek design is cool! The earbuds are lame and fall out of your ears. Also, it is not the most intuitive for the non-savvy. Overall it is pretty awesome!"
3,Shuffle problems? Read this review,"OK, I'm copping out on a full review. My main purpose here is to tell you how to fix the Shuffle problem that I and many others have been experiencing. You won't find this in any Sansa docs, so here goes...First you pick your music category (usally All, but you may pick a particular playlist or Album as well). Then you turn on the Repeat All feature. Then you turn on the Shuffle feature. You *must* do it in this order or it won't work.After that you should get random shuffling without any repeats or ""favorite"" songs coming up over and over again. This trick worked for me and I hope it works for you as well. I returned an Express then spent a lot of frustrating time figuring this out when the second one had the same behavior. Sansa deserves a real bashing for this oversight in documentation but otherwise their player is top-notch."
1,The worst mp3 player on this planet,"This is the worst mp3 player I have ever seen.1. When I copy files to it, it always show message like ""the device has stopped working or connection is broken"", then I have to take it out and plug in it again in order to copy more files.2. My files are titled like 01xxx, 02xxx, 03xxx etc. However, the player displays them in revised order, and plays them in revised order!3. If you pause it in middle of playing an mp3 file, you will have to play from beginning of the file after the player turned off automatically.4. It's hard to switch between MTP and MSC mode....I had a Sansa e260 before, though they are both from Sandisk, but Sansa e260 has none of above problems. So I'm very disappointed to see it's such a player.I have used some other mp3 players from Creative, some other no-name brands, my conclusion is: any player on this planet, including Sansa clip and e2xx, is much better than this one."
1,Buyer beware,"I just plugged in my new Sansa Express, and immediately my hard drive crashed and now appears to be damaged beyond repair. (I am running PC Doctor now.) The computer in question is a ThinkPad X60s which has run flawlessly now for 4 months. It seems unlikely that the Sansa is the culprit, but as I say the crash came within seconds after I plugged it in. Thought you should know."
2,"OK, but stopped working after 1.5 months",Bought this for the value and worked just fine until the menu buttons stopped functioning like they should. I'll be returning this cheap product now.There's a 1 year limited warranty...hoping Sansa takes it back.
4,You can't beat it for the money.,"I have owned the Sansa Expresss for over a month and am quite happy with it. I bought it mainly to use with Audible Book downloads and it works seamlessly with Audible software. But I also have used it for music and just to store a file like a memory stick/flash drive. Sound quality is largely a function of the ear buds or headphones that are used with it. The ones that come with it are junk but better quality ones make the experience just fine. The screen is difficult to read in bright light and twice when I start it it was stuck on the opening screen. I don't use a lanyard but attaching it to the USB cap end seems like a dumb design, even though the cap fits nice and snug, I'd be afraid it would fall off.But for the money? You can't beat it."
1,It did not last very long...,"Very easy to use, connects easily without a cable and is straightforward to navigate. Unfortunately mine stopped functioning after less than three months. I would not recommend it."
1,Died within minutes of synching,"Well, plugged it into my USB and synched some random songs. Plugged in the headphones and tried to play it. It tried to play the first song and stalled. It powered off a couple minutes later. It's just dead now. Can't charge it or power it on. Taking it back to the retailer. Read the reviews on this and didn't think I'd get a lemon, but sure enough... Beware of this product. The people complaining about this are for real. This was my first experience with Sandisk. I'll never buy anything from them again."
3,"Not bad, if you're a windows user... okay otherwise","If you use WMP and use it to sync with the Sansa Express, this is a nice device. You can create playlists and organize files nicely.But... If you're using the SE as a USB drive under any other OS, or just don't want to use WMP, it's a pain in the neck --- the Express ignores any directory structure you place the files in, and you cannot create playlists (like m3u's) by hand.That said, I like the rechargeable battery feature and the fact that I don't need a cable to connect it to my PC --- makes it perfect for use while riding my bike to/from work.So, it'll do for what I am using it for, but as a general purpose MP3 player for someone NOT using WMP, I think it needs a few firmware changes."
3,Ease of Use?,"Really impressed when I recieved this. I bought it as a gift for my husbands 60th birthday. He loved it, but we have trouble navigating through the function list. At times I get stuck on recording and can't get it back to the music I want to listen to. So, programming ease of use is lacking. I will continue to try and work with it but I recommend a larger unit with a bigger screen, navigation may be easier."
4,a short note,A good CD when you want to forget about your life and simply let your mind wonder to someone else's
3,Enjoyed this.,"A friend turned me on to this band, and I have to say, I resisted at first, but I really dig them now."
2,"Horridly poppish, boringly childish,","I listened to this album because of the high rank it got on AMG and it's supposed emotionally-sweeping lyrics.As much as I hate to use such harsh words, this is little more than your average MTV package, lyrics that may have been written with sincerety, but fit all-too-well to very familiar patterns. Nothing new, nothing touching. Nothing meaningful said throughout the so-called ""Album of the Year"".The music itself, too, is nothing to really talk about.Try before you buy."
1,does not fit the MFC-456CN!,This ink set does not fit the MFC-465CN! The box once it arrives clearly does not include the MFC-465CN on the list and it is a different form factor than the LC51CL ink set you really need! i bought two sets of these that do not fit. Do not waste you time/money on this one. It is particularly annoying that amazon includes a popup that says it does fit. It does not!
2,Generic ink for Brother MFC 240,"The ink did not last long. 2 out of 4, blue and yellow cartridges leaked. The leakage is not worth the amount of money saved. Towards the end of cartridge, color combination was very poor. Do Not buy this generic ink, even when you get it for free. It is a very fast way to ruin your printer. The ink leaks as you open the cap of the cartridge and start inserting into its place inside the printer."
3,Good Price but does not print on economic mode,"Hello: I have installed the cartridges on my printer and is quite a lilte tricky. You have to take out the cartridges again and then they start printing. They worked good on normal mode, but when you use them on economic mode the quality goes really bad. Anyway I think for the price is ok. Just have to wait if the cartridges has an aceptable durability"
5,Very decent quality product,1) Very good price.2) I printed photos with the color inks on photopaper and I didn't see any differences from the original ones.Recommended!
3,Great!,I was a little concerned buying the cartridges but when they arrived it came with very basic instructions and walked me through step by step on how to install them. I use my printer frequently and haven't had an issue yet. I will continue to re-order =)
5,Works as expected,"Received this product from Abacus 24-7 - on time and in perfect condition. Installed the color cartridges about 2 weeks ago, but have not yet installed the black. No problems so far. Print quality seems about the same as the Brother brand cartridge that came with the printer. Assuming that this continues, I will definitely order this product again from the same supplier."
4,review,"good transaction and delivery. For whatever reason, the cyan color not longer functions. I think it got gumed up. I simply don't know if the previous Brother cartridge did it, or this new one did it."
4,exceeded all expectations,"I decided to try these because of the amazingly inexpensive price and the good reviews. Never the less, I feared it would ruin my printer, as it was not approved Brother cartridge, or at best, give messy or poor results. I'm delighted to be wrong. Quality, ease of use, everything exceeded all expectations. I'll never waste money on name brands ink again.NB I've not yet tried it on photo paper."
4,Kipper gets mixed up!,"I got this book for my son in preparation for his second birthday and he loves it! I't teaches children (and parents) about the importance of being organized, but it also teaches the importance of friends. I love the illustrations and most of the language. My one criticism of the book is that one part is particularly confusing for kids (when Kipper himself is confused about his birthday, so I guess that's appropriate)."
4,Another Cute Kipper Book,"Like the other Kipper books this one is easy to read and the illustrations are great. It's a bit ""busier"" than some of the authors earlier works and lacks the simplicity of the earliest stories. I've also found a companion sticker style activity book which is nice but the stickers are not movable from page to page."
3,A bit confusing for a preschooler...,"Today, tomorrow, yesterday? We found this book a bit confusing for a 3 year old. Kipper is a favourite of ours, but this one was just ""ok""."
2,???????,Typical US representation of ... ...well anything. Overly simplified and seems almost to talk down to the viewer. Check out the BBC if really want information about the universe.But if you need superfluous information and electronic transition graphics repeated over and over and... ! Again this is typical time filler that gets sold to underachieving TV executives.
5,Sour Milk Sea...,"Unfortunately I can only review this on ""Sour Milk Sea"", but this is worth getting if just for that single...One of the BEST harrison songs ever written ...could have definitely (and maybe should have been) on the White Album..."
5,Sour Milk Sea,It is worth the price for Sour Milk Sea alone. Even if you do not know anything about the backup band.
4,A Must Have Album,"This Greatest Hits Collection is Los Cadetes' version of Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue""...if you only buy one album of ranchero y corrido, this should be the one.The production value is good; all the instruments ring loud and clear, and yet it sounds organic, like they're playing in your living room or garage. And the overall sound...geez, makes you want to grab a beer and throw a ""grito"" in sorrow.There's an old saying in Spanish, even the memories hurt...these songs sound like that."
2,not what we ordered,"what was sent to us is not what is pictured. we rcvd a smaller handle, cant lower it as low as pictured item. We're keeping it cause I dont want to deal with returning, but a little diappointed cause cann ot use."
2,Great Social Commentary but Third Rate Musical,"""No For An Answer"" is a meager musical with a great 1930's leftist message. If you're looking for social protest, the recording is mildly interesting. If you're looking for musical theater, go somewhere else. Marc Blitzstein has written some rather majestic orchestral works, but the music is thin here and what's there is too often just a snippet. Disappointing as entertainment."
4,Quick and cute...,"""Jinxed"" was really a cute book. It was fast paced and chock full of fun characters. Afia St. John has bad luck. Her whole life she has considered herself to be Jinxed and the recent theft of her fortune is just one more mishap in her long line of troubles. Enter Jake Leeds. a sexy PI hired to keep an eye on her. Afia thinks that Jake needs her to be his assistant, and has no idea he is being paid to keep her out of trouble. The chemistry between Afia and Jake just sizzles. They were a fantastic couple and Afia had some great friends in her life that lit up the pages as well. Jinxed was a great little book. I am so happy that i found it and definitely plan to look for more work by Beth Ciotta."
3,Sweet Book,"This book reminded me of a sweet Marilyn Monroe movie, in the very best of ways. It was sweet and cute and made me happy, even though I'm not really a fan of women who need a man to care for them.Afia has buried her father, two husbands and has been bilked out of a small fortune - but somehow she manages to keep naiveté and sweetness. Her sweetness makes the story. I enjoyed the fast pace of the story and all the little digs at superstition."
4,enjoyable read,"Book was quite enjoyable and a fairly quick read. Love story has just enough steam to be hot, but not enough to be pornagraphic."
3,Not for everyone,This romance includes new age theology and homosexual romance neither of which interest me. There is a lot of humor and the story is well told though.
4,Entertaining and educational,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was entertaining and informative, and I learned the sometimes sad stories of those men who were true ""originals"". The subjects of this book are not ones we have learned of in normal educational channels. Some of them are related in some way to people we learned about in school, although most of these men were previously unknown to me. They did, however, each have a distinct impact on the world of their time."
2,Not the Same,I was not happy when I installed this item the remote cables are to short. I had to fight to get it to work right.
5,A stunning book,"This book is simply stunning, and a bargain at this price. It is a large coffee-table sized volume that combines beautiful production values with scholarly articles on various aspects of Champlain's eventful life. Many perspectives are included, from historians, archaeologists, art historians, archivists, museum curators from around the world. For the professional historian or just the lover of history, this book is a real treat. Original maps and illustrations, photos and images of all kinds delight the eye. It makes Champlain - a true Renaissance man - and his world really ""come alive"", as well it should, for modern audiences. Dive in and read sections as your interest leads you. The only downside is that because of it's size, you'll have to read it on your lap."
4,as described,"Item received quickly, as described. the box it came in was HUGE, so don't be fooled into thinking it is not what was ordered. LOL"
5,Just as expected,"The perfect sized drip pan for small places.Super fast shipping, and the pans even arrived with no shipping damage!Great product, Great price!"
3,not for the experienced magickal person,"If you're already familiar with how magick works and you practice it yourself, you won't need this book. It is aimed towards those who wish to practice magick but aren't sure how it works. I will say, though, that it is a very good guide for a beginner, but I found that I already knew much of what was in this book. Overall, not for the experienced magickal person."
2,My Mistake Buying This,"My daughters love Thomas and I imagined them hanging out in this tent as a fort. Unfortunately, there isn't room for them to both be in it and it collapses if it's touched with a little too much force. It is currently folded up in our garage, as it has been for many months. There are many more interesting and educational toys I should have spent my money on."
5,Great imaginitve toy for Thomas fans,"I purchased this play tent for my nephew who is turning two. He adores Thomas, and this play tent is just what he had always dreamed of. He crawls inside and plays for hours and feels secure and hidden away from the rest of the world where his daydreams and imagination can come to life. Highly recommend this toy for anybody who has a little fan of Thomas the Train."
5,thomas tent,"son loves thomas and his tent, we can hardly drag him out of it. perfect design in that it folds easily into a small, thin bag. about 20 times easier to fold than my pop up hunting blind."
5,The fun train,"There is a world of imagination hidden in this toy. It was the hit of the party for my grandson's second birthday. If you know a youngster who is a Thomas fan, this is the toy for them to foster their creative spirit."
4,All aboard!,"As soon as my 3 yr old crawled into this tent, he loved it. Sitting on the floor it was not very sturdy and would keep falling over. I put it on his bed and it seems a bit more sturdy and frees up floor space. The folding directions are not clear and I could not master them. Over all, I am pleased w/ the purchase for the cost."
5,Joy for an autistic boy,"This Thomas the Train tent was a gift for an autistic boy's 4th birthday and he has played with it daily. The parents have set the tent up in their family room and find it a constant delight for a boy who loves trains. His dad is a real car buff and likes to show his special car. When he takes his son to car shows, he also takes this tent as it keeps his son busy during the whole day, can even be used for the boy's napping spot, and gets folks to visit his car. This was a great purchase and I'm delighted it is being enjoyed to the fullest!"
5,Great for imagination!,"My 2 year old son just HAD to have this after playing with it at his cousin's. It is perfect for our tiny house because it folds flat for easy storage. It is extremely easy to set up and also to put away. Easy to clean up after a busy day of playing. Big enough for at least 3 kids to play in comfortably and my little one loves to eat his lunch and take naps in it, too. We got more than our money's worth."
4,Thomas Toy,I bought this for my grandson 2 years ago and he still loves to play in it. There is just something magical about being able to get into something and think you are hidden. I wish I were small and young enough to play in it.
3,Fold up issues,"Overall, very cute product. This kids love it!However, the supposedly easy fold up is a joke. You have to try your best to get it small enough to cram it in the carry along bag. If you let go, wham, it opens right back up again.Glad I got it, but best to keep it at the house as it is not portable."
3,Thomas Train Play tenr,"My son got this for Christmas, he loves it. Althought, he loves anything Thomas. I wish the directions would have explained where the black pole goes in the train, I figured it out, but on Christmas eve you want to set it up quick. For the price it is a great toy. It arrived pretty fast too."
2,Misleading = Beware,"My mother in law ordered this for my 2 year old son. It DOES NOT come with an inflatable steering wheel. We have had a replacement sent and it did not have it either. Also, there is a stick that goes in the head of the train that comes out easily while playing inside. It can be very dangerous when the little ones get it out. My son pulled it out and came running out with it. I was so afraid that he would have fallen and shoved it down his throat. We have removed all parts - so its just the train that you see - which is know safer."
3,Thomas has no bottom!,"I excitedly purchased this tent for my Thomas-the-Train-obsessed 2&1/2 year old, thinking I would just replace the 'ball pit' I had--essentially a child's play tent with plastic balls in it for kids to play in. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed when I realized, after putting up the tent, that there is no bottom to Thomas! So when I put all of the balls in the tent, they do not stay there, especially when my son crawls in. It's cute enough, and sure, it's Thomas, but it's not very durable and moves around very, very easily--and it has no bottom! Essentially it's just a three-sided train. For that reason alone I give it only three stars. And the instructions are very vague, but like I said, more disappointed than anything."
2,Thomas the Floppy Tank Engine Tent,"I have 2 toddlers (2 1/2 and 1 years). They were very excited to see this tent when they got it, as they both love Thomas. But the tent has no floor to it and is very flimsy. So everytime the boys go in or out of the tent it either falls over or half collapses on itself. So basically, the tent always lays in a half-folded and half-open position somewhere on the floor. It was a great idea, just poor construction. Needless to say, we will not be keeping the tent around much longer."
1,My Nephews LOVE their Thomas Tent!!!,My 2-year old twin nephews LOVE their Thomas tent!! On Christmas Day it was their favorite new toy. They took all of their other presents inside and they love to take their naps inside of Thomas. My sister-in-law loves that it folds away easily.
2,disappointing purchase,I ordered this for my grandson who loves all things Thomas. It is much smaller than I thought and it is very flimsy. He was not at all interested in it because it is so small. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Waste of money,"I bought this because my boy's love trains. They did not like playing with this, it is too small inside. I put it outside in the summer hoping they would like it better out there but they didn't and it tore up pretty easliy, so I threw it out. Build a blanket fortress in the corner of the room and your kids will love it."
4,Nice toy,"My 2 year old son loves it, but I was very disappointed to see that it is made of a thin material that is used in some disposable goods, I though it was made of another material when I bought it. My son was 18 months old when I gave it to him and I am surprised to see that it still looks nice almost a year later, I thought it wouldn't be durable enough because of the material that it is made of. Anyway, it's a cute and fun toy, my son really loves it."
1,Cute but flimsy,"My 18 month old son got this play tent for Christmas. He loves Thomas, so he was quite taken with it. The sleeve for the plastic rod split open immediately, so the tent had little structural integrity. If I didn't hold it up when he went in or out, it collapsed.The only fun he had with it was pushing it back and forth across the floor."
4,What a hit!,The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because my niece hasn't been able to tell me how well it folds back into its container--because my little grand-nephew (2 1/2 years old) doesn't want to get out of it! He adores Thomas the Train so this engine playhouse is perfect. It can also fit a friend (and the dog). Great fun--I recommend it.
5,Grandson loves it,This is the best thing I could have gotten for my 2 year old grandson. It was a big hit on Christmas. I Recommend this to everyone. Even I got into it with him to play. Lots of fun.
4,Amazon purchase,"The Thomas the Tank Playhut is a really nice product. The only problem that we had is that it does not fold up as easily as advertised. It is a big hit with the kids, and it was a good value, and the shipping was prompt,"
3,confusing,"My 2 year old son got this for a gift, he loves it, but it falls over very easliy, and I spent half the time standing it back up, also the directions on how to fold it and put it back in the bag are not very clear,"
2,always sidways tent,"My mother purchased this for our little ones, 2 and 3. It does not stand up for long, the kids just lean against it and it is on its side, and I constantly have to stand it up. It is reeally flimsy. The kids seem to enjoy it, but fight over it when it tips."
4,Successful birthday present for 3-year-old nephew,"My nephew loves Thomas the train. He collects the trains, watches the DVDs and can name all the trains. We bought this for him for his third birthday and he absolutely loved it. He spent the rest of the party playing in the tent and getting his mom and I to join him (which is no easy task). He even sat inside the tent and watched a DVD on TV through the back window rather than leave the tent to get a better view.For the parents - the tent assembles in seconds. It just pops right open. I believe it also came with a storage bag, but I'm not sure how difficult it was to get back into the bag since it was still set up and being played with when I left."
3,Fun for the kids - difficult to fold,"We bought this for my two kids - 4 and 2 - for Christmas and they enjoy playing with it everyday. It is very lightweight and nothing to worry about like small pieces or loose strings (there is a string on the bottom when you open it up to keep the walls the right distance, but appears to be secured very well). However, the instructions for folding it are not completely clear. We can get it folded to the point where it is flat very easily, but it's that last fold that is tricky to do. We have yet to figure out how to get it back into the size where it will fit into the travel bag. Otherwise, I would have given it five stars."
4,The Kids love this !!,My nephews got one for Christmas and it was a big hit then and still is now. When other kids come over they ALL want to play in it
1,HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this for my 14-month old because he likes to crawl under tables, chairs, etc. I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened it - what a piece of GARBAGE!!! It is made of some paper-like product (like a Bounty paper towel) and it smells horrible. My son had ink all over his fingers after playing in it for just a few minutes. I am definitely returning this item. How annoying that the material of this product is nowhere to be found on the box or in the online description."
5,this should come in handy,"recently bought a 2000 expedition that needs some TLC so I bought a chiltons for it through amazon. Service was prompt and I had the manual in my mailbox in a matter of a few business days. The manual I received covers 97-09 full size ford pickups, expedition and navigator, not 97-00 per the item title. Very happy with my purchase, and I know the manual will pay for itself."
2,Purchase the vacuum seal model instead!,"Pay the extra cash and purchase the vacuum seal mug instead. These look similar, and while the seal on the lid works well for spills, my coffee is cold after 1/2 an hour. Save yourself the hassle and get this instead:Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Ounces, Black"
2,Should've pay extra for Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel,"I got this ""his and her"" mugs thinking it should be as good as Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel. It's heavy and it doesn't hold much beverage. I should've just pay more and get the real deal -- Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel keeps the drink cooler even after a hot day in the car. keep body hydrated is good for health. Just don't put beverage that's too hot. rinse it and keep it dry every night to prevent mold. Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel is like a hidden jewel, wish we know about it sooner."
1,AWFUL!!,"I bought these coffee mugs because everyone at work who has one raves about them. I wish I had passed. They only keep my coffee warm for one hour but worse than that, the red one got water between the layers and now it will mold and be ruined!! I feel I wasted my money on them and I really regret buying them. I am now going to have to buy another travel mug to replace these and I have only had them for a little over a week."
2,Quality really fell off on this Model,"I regret not paying attention to the customer comments brfore placing my order. As many said they would, they did ...These cups cracked their seals, where now moisture builds in between the layers as well as the plastic cup (vrs stainless) does not hold their temperature (HEAT) nearly as long.GO STAINLESS, its worth the extra bucks"
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I gave these tumblers as gifts and have one myself. They are the best on-the-go/travel mugs. They are spill proof and durable. They alaso come in great colors. I am going to get many more of these to keep in other places and give as gifts. My friends and I have dubbed these the ""adult sippy cups"". The Best."
1,Absolute Joke,Dont even think of buying this. I have two coffee mugs from nissan and attracted by the cool looks and promise of keeping coffee hot and the price I bought it 4 days.While it looks good on my desk it only keeps coffee hot for the first 20 mins. as if they went by a dollar per minute criteria while designing this. I am tempted to throw this away it is absolutely irritating to have non performing mug however cool it might look.What a waste of money.
4,Love Contigo products!,This product is great for travelers. The no-spill feature is the reason this product was purchased. Very happy with the purchase. Plus price was very reasonable for the set.
2,Ehhh--,"I LOVE Contigo products. We have at least 6 water bottles and 4 metal travel mugs. These were extremely disappointing. The red one broke from a minor fall within days, and they really don't hold all that much liquid. There's much better contigo mugs out there."
2,Condensation,"This type of Contigo mug doesn't hold up like its metal Contigo counterpart does to condensation. I bought it thinking the insulative properties were the same as the one I had before, but sadly, it isn't."
2,Not the best...,"Only the lids are dishwasher safe and water gets inside the plastic and will not come out. Also, not BPA free."
2,no insulation,"The coffee doesn't seem to stay warm very long. Not like the metal mugs. They do not leak though, no matter if you lay them on their side."
5,Essential.,"If you fancy yourself a philosopher, I would assume you are familiar with this work. A giant of a work, possibly Maritain's masterpiece. The Introduction alone is sweetness to the scholar...."
4,McNabb's on solid ground with On Thin Ice,"Brian McNabb has given us a very satisfying group of stories, all about a normal boy growing up and making choices about who he wants for friends and about how he should conduct himself in his world of family and school and town. All the stories are told from the point of view of a young narrator between the ages of about 7 and 13. McNabb's talent comes in giving us an authentic voice. We hear a boy, not an adult pretending to be a boy. ""Neckbreaker"", though awkwardly titled, is my favorite of the stories. As it follows our hero over a period of several months, we see him gain insight into himself and others. It's a lovely rendition of an oft told tale. Much to McNabb's credit, he resists the urge to moralize. The stories are good as stories, they are enjoyable. Well done."
2,Not so good,"This particular cover was sold to me on the promise that it would fit my motorcycle perfectly. It didn't. But it is ok. What is worse is that it was torn apart (where one piece was glued to the other) by wind in 2 weeks. And it doesn't have any ventilation holes thus leading to condensation and rusting.In general, PVC is not a good material for a cover."
1,Literally blew apart after less than one week,"Not much to say. I bought my first Nelson Rigg cover (same as this model) last October. It developed several rips through the winter that I attributed to winter wear and tear. The rips got so bad I had to buy a new one. On March 22 I received the same cover (figuring it'd last longer in the warmer spring and summer months). I get home from work yesterday and the front looks like it literally blew up like a popped baloon. Unreal, total waste of money. I have a picture but not sure it's possible to upload."
3,Worth what I payed for it,This cover does the job for what I need it for. I didn't want to spend very much money on a cover so I bought this one. The material is cheap and it doesn't vent moisture. It's ok for me because I only cover it on days it rains which is not very often in Southern California. For the price it keeps it out of the rain. It doesn't compare at all to the more expensive covers but you get what you pay for. I don't plan on keeping my sport bike much longer so this works well for now.
3,Ok for the price,"If you are looking for a cheap way to cover your bike this cover will work. If you have a windshield on your bike the treatment on the material will leave a rainbow glare that tough to get off, but overall it's not a bad cover."
1,PARK SMART CLEAN PARK,"I didn't want to go through all the ""work"" involved with painting a concrete garage floor so i chose this product. first of all, it was not as thick/heavy as i thought it would be (which i guess is partly is my fault for not know what thickness this ""mil"" was) but i figured i could live with it. i bought 2 of the 9 x 20' mats and thought they would come on a roll like a carpet - not folded into a small box. it is unbelievable how many folds and wrinkles there are. i wrote to the manufacturer to see if the folds would come out and was told ""over time they may relax some but will not go away"". there are no corners available so there are open spaces at the junction of the sides and the back. they warn it is slippery when wet but we haven't had any rain so i haven't found out exactly how slippery it is. overall i hate this product and am sorry i bought it. it is certainly not worth the money as far as i am concerned. don't waste your money"
2,Save your money.,"It got us through the winter, which is what I intended for it to do untilit warmed up enough that I could do the necessary work to get the garageto drain into a sump. But, by spring it was pretty much junk. Sand fromwinter street sanding and other things the car tracks in on the tires madelittle holes all over in the plastic film. It was stained and ugly and doesn'tcome clean no matter how much you scrub with soap and water. It left earlyin the Spring... on the garbage truck."
2,Falls apart,"I agree with many of the comments here. I've had a 9x20 in my garage for years to help with my Silverado pickup mess in New England. It does help keep the slush,snow,water and oil off the garage floor and from spreading all over the garage. The problem I have is that the weak plastic edging (which is a pain and time consuming to install. Believe me it does not insatll in seconds) breaks easily especially on the garage door side which is driven over and over. I called the company and they were nice enough to send me free replacement edges, but the same thing keeps happening and after a while the vinyl mat starts to tear and looks ratty. If they would come up with some edging on the garage door side that will not crack and break so easily it would make this product so much better and less of a hassle to maintain."
3,Garage floor,"I have painted my garage floor with epoxy paint, but in the past year some has come off with the hot tires. This mat is perfect to protect the paint and makes clean up of the floor very easy. I thought it would be thicker but otherwise no problem."
1,Don't waste your money,"These mats were a pain from the start, the pieces around the edge didn't fit together well, the mats bunched up over time, water pools on them and they are impossible to keep clean because the dirt gets caught around the edges. I could not get rid of them fast enough!"
3,Product review,Directions could have gone into greater detail. Lots of trial and error. At the best thus far I would rate this product as average.
4,Atomic Age Secrets You Don't Really Want to Know,"Reporter Trish Cagle has a long-time bone to pick with the editors she's worked for: they always seem to sidestep the important and often-controversial stories she wants to cover. As this heavily researched novel begins, Cagle is about to embark on a journey into the murky depths of the atomic age. She soon discovers that editors around the world have ignored or buried the greatest coverup of her lifetime: the nuclear power industry has a far-worse safety and bestpractices record than we can possibly imagine. This book represents Cagle's personal quest and, as such, is told in large measure through dialogues with her mentor and friend Max Rogers, nuclear/environmental experts and the victims of the tragedies themselves. When all is said and done, the answers Cagle finds at the end of her journey are almost more dramatic than dangers of nuclear accidents she sets out to uncover."
3,"Attractive, but......","These are the nicest looking brackets! The specifications were exactly as published, however they don't work very well with glass shevles that are more than about 6"" deep. My shelves are 12 inches deep and while overall they look nice, there is not enough bracket support to place weighty items on the shelves. And, the shelves themselves tend to slope downward because of the need for additional support. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend them."
4,Yamanni Ryu - Okinawan Karate Bojutsu,"I have trained with Toshihiro Oshiro Sensei learning Bojutsu, Saijutsu, Tunfajutsu and Kumibo. This video is an indispensable tool for the practitioner or instructor of any weapons art. The video is perfect for the beginner or the advanced student. Tsunami has done a great job."
5,"one word for this tape, EXCEPTIONAL","when are you going to make a vol. 2, vol.3 ........ of this tape, i cant wait, please make as many vol. as you can about this style..."
1,Old film - bad color,The DVD was supposed to be from 2007 but the date that played on the DVD was 1996. Color was washed out. Do not buy this DVD.
2,What's with the price tag?,"The personnel of the MJQ? Wow. Where are you from? The review below is correct except the spelling of Connie (not with a y--I know I'm nitpicky, sorry I can't help it); I have to add that that is the ONLY personnel MJQ ever had, with the exception of Kenny Clarke for a short time at the beginning until CK took over in 1955. ""Jasmin Tree"" and ""Space"" were my introductions to MJQ and they may not be their best-ever performances, but they will always be my favorites. As a young teen in the early '70s I had never heard anything like it, nor have I since. It was just as magic to me then as all the electric psychedelia I was also listening to at that time, and more beautiful. I would love to hear it again without all the decades of scratches on the vinyl lp, but not at that ridiculous price. Do other Apple cds cost that much?"
5,Great Scent,"Like the scent, it's one of my favs, I use it as a baseIt's strong enough to stand alone, which is nice"
2,Great Name....Very poor quality,"Smells too much PA Pere' Old Man smell....Nothing like the name,.,,,,Opium.....an insult to the Originalwas not what I expected with the name ""Opium"""
3,Not What I expected,"Not sure what I was thinking, but ends up that it smells like old lady musky scent. It came super fast, like in 1 day! I was amazed at the delivery speed. I bought two other scents, the Egyptian Goddess and Rose. Love both of those, and for the low price, I don't mind getting a dud. I'm going to try some others."
5,Love It!,"Just received this in today and had to put it on as soon as I opened the package! I am a very picky person, but this I love! It has a musk smell mixed with a little spice, very different!"
2,Strong fitting name. Too strong for me.,Although I love Auric blends and hadn't found one I didn't like things have changed. This one was overpowering. I touched it to my skin and it was hours before the scent eased. Maybe if I stood out in the 60 mph winds we're having today it could work. My favorite is African Musk by Auric Blends.
4,Nice Fragrance,"The Black Opium oil is an exotic fragrance. I do not like flowery, sweet perfumes so this was a perfect choice. However, I find that it fades quickly so it needs to be re-applied. As a result, I'm using more and will need to re-order. I did not receive it on or near the promised date. For me, this was a drawback considering the shipping costs. Overall, I am pleased with the product. I will re-order and hope that it is delivered on time.PB"
2,Tooo STRONG!,I order a few of these oils. Different ones and Rasta happen to be one of them. I ordered the Rasta and other ones from the reviews I read. Rasta is not one of my favorites. It is too strong for my taste. I think the one I like the best would be Egyptian Goddess and One Love.
2,Smells Like Your Grandmother,"If you want to smell like your grandmother, This is the one for you. I bought this thinking that the opium smell would have a bit of a musky undertone but the amber just makes it smell like straight grandma."
4,Good product,"Right now it works like a charm, I hope it will work for a long time too, this remains to be seen. For now we like it."
3,Sax Rohmer mystery,I'm not familiar with Sax Rohmer (Fu Manchu never attracted me) but I recently read one of his ebooks and liked it enough I thought I would try another. He is a very good wordsmith but the story was a little hard for me to get into. I'd try another one though.
3,A Mediocre Messiah,"There is nothing very special about this Messiah. Some of the soloists clearly have pronunciation issues with the English. Some tempos are markedly different than ""the norm"" also. This is not necessarily bad but I do not think the choices always capture the spirit of the inspired text! The choir does good work though!Overall you will do much better with performances by Pinnock or Parrott with the Tavener Enemble (both period style) the old C. Davis on Phillips (small scale with modern instuments) or for a larger scale ""Messiah"", Andrew Davis on EMI, to name a few."
3,quick delviery,this is a great reference book in regards to instructional technology and design. I am always using it to refresh and apply new designs.
2,go for sham tickoo,"This book is ok for starters. Just about ok.It omits (intentional) a whole bunch of features. Toogood barely touches drafting (pro/detail)(omits BOM tables, balloons, some important assembly features - they are available in advanced tutorial). This book leaves a lot to be desired. Only the basic - very basic proengineer tools are discussed in this book. If you really want your money's worth, go for sham tickoo's proengineer wildfire for designers. In tickoo's book, you get a fair knowledge. He discusses good number of menus and options. It is easy to refer back in case of any questions because of the organization of the book. Hope this review is useful."
1,Very sorry to see this,"There's simply no comparison between this version and the original. The illustrations in the original ""Bible in Pictures for Little Eyes"" were profound, mysterious, some of them even dark and frightening--they gave us things to wonder about and left us with questions we could not answer; the present illustrations are trivial. Yet another example of the aesthetic bankruptcy of American evangelicalism: when only the ""message"" matters, the inculcation of ""Biblical truth"", the aesthetic dimension is lost."
2,Portrays a very angry God -,"I bought this for my 4 year old. He loves Bible stories and we've been through several children's Bibles.I have to say this one is rather dark. Nearly every story in the Old Testament portion tells of someone being killed or dying with the implication that they sinned against God and thus God struck them down. I find myself softening the words up a bit as my son frequently looks worried while we read this particular book.I want my son to know God and see Him as a loving, caring God, not an angry, violent God. I know as an adult that God is a loving, sometimes angry God, but for teaching a 4 year old... I don't know.I think this particular Bible would be better suited to an older child (8 or 9) and it really is not marketed for them. Clearly it is aimed at the preschool kid. I thought it too heavy and a bit odd for the target audience."
2,What happened to the Art?,I grew up with the Bible in Pictures for Little Eyes. It used real art for many of the stories. The art was so good that I can still remember many of those paintings 35+ years later. I wanted to get a copy for my niece and nephew..but the new art style is cartoonish and not at all special. I will look for a used copy of the older version.
2,I would not buy it again,"This book is well written in the respect that it gets readers involved and thinking, but I don't feel that it sticks close enough to The Word. I found myself having to edit things as I read to our son. That is a no go in this family."
2,Too simple for four-year olds,"This isn't our kids only Bible story book, and the stories pale compared to other books. The stories lack detail, context, and are plain boring. Simply put, you can't tell every story in six or eight sentences.For example, the story of ""David and Goliath"":""A giant has come to fight against God's people. The giant's name is Goliath. All the men of Israel have run away from him. They are afraid to fight him because he is so big but David is not afraid. David knows that God will help him. David does not have a gun but he has a slingshot. Do you see it in his hand? He takes some stones and uses his slingshot to throw a stone at the giant. The stone hits the giant in the head and the great Goliath falls over dead.- What is the giant's name?- What did David hit him with?- Why were all the other people afraid of Goliath?""That's all to that story. For ages four and up, look somewhere else."
2,Inferior illustrations,"My children (now in their 20's) loved this book in its previous format with the older illustrations. The text is very good, but it was really the pictures that won their hearts. These were the old pictures that I enjoyed on my Sunday School take-home papers in the 1950's. I don't think publishers realize that children don't know or care if pictures are ""new"" or ""old"". My children loved the illustrations in the 1980's just as much as I did in the 1950's. And children today would enjoy them too. The fact that the older illustrations are different from the average children's book today sets them apart & makes the book special. After all, the Bible is not just your average book either! I hope someday the old pictures will reappear. In the meantime, my kids argue about who will get our copy someday!"
3,Older is Better,"I love this book and always give it as a baby gift to new parents. But I sorely miss the older version with the beautiful mural style paintings as illustrations. The newer ""cartoony"" pictures don't do justice to the text."
4,"Good, but not organic","It says about 80 times on this page that this pasta is organic, but it's not. There's no USDA label on the box pictured and the De Boles site makes no mention of this or its other corn pasta being organic. Other than that, although I'm loyal to Mrs. Leeper's, this is good stuff and is appropriate for celiacs."
2,Encyclopedia of Straw Man Arguments,"Well the title of my review pretty much sums up the entire book. As many other reviewers have already communicated, most of the book is made up of silly arguments. I'd guess at least 95% of these arguments are easily refuted. I wouldn't be surprised if even the common, ignorant Christian could refute many of these claims of errancy.If you're looking for a book full of excuses/reasons to not believe in Christianity (and not interested in an accurate examination of the text) I'd recommend reading this book and taking it at face value. You can be as ignorant as your favorite Christian for only $50.If you're truly interested in learning about the Bible, I'd recommend reading something that is actually scholarly and not aimed at angry teenagers. I'm not a Christian, and I don't care what you believe, but this book is, for the most part, only useful in pointing out obvious absurdities in the Christian bible...the one translated into English."
1,Laughable,"I took a look at this book using the ""look inside"" feature, and I noticed the author faults a verse in 2nd Chronicles (4:2) for talking about a bowl with a diameter of 10 and a circumference of 30.The author says anyone with an understanding of math and the value of pi would know that the circumference has to be 31.4I could barely keep myself from laughing. People were not allowed to round numbers 2000 years ago? The Bible is not a technical manual. I thought 30 was amazingly close to 31.4! I don't think they even had a decimal system back then! I was considering reading this book but this kind of foolishness reflects so poorly on the mind of the author that I can't imagine wasting my time on trash like this."
1,It is a question of faith ?,"When I read about biblical errancy, an important point comes to my mind . If I should be able to give my life in defense of my point of view. Mr Dennis McKinsey, should you do it ? Jesus Christ dying in the cross for all unfaithfull people of the world and his ressurrection from the death, I think it is the uncontestable thuth of the bible and dissipates any clouds of doubts that could come upon our hearts. But as you can say as a matter of fact It is a question of FAITH ."
1,TOO RIDICULOUS TO BOTHER WITH!,"Poor Dennis McKinsey. He has such an axe to grind with Christianity, and this book only makes him look like the ""fool"" Psalm 14:1 warns us about. He often uses absurd examples, such as referring to a ""Gospel"" as a biography of Jesus, when anyone with a modicum of intelligence knows the true meaning of ""gospel"" is ""good news."" McKinsey insists those trying to refute him not to use other biblicists or apologists in their arguments, but show proof from th Bible, yet he constantly goes to Ingersoll, Jefferson or Paine to back up his proof, thereby rendering himself without credibility, let alone consistency. Its always that way for those who refuse truth.If you want a great (and even humorous)..."
5,A Remarkable Piece of Work,"Just to add to the praise - before reading this book I had assumed many of the erroneus biblical statements to be accurate ..even though I am not a Christian. McKinsey shows us nicely just how successful Western Christian indoctrination has truly been! Although scholarly, he does engage a tone which is far from objective - and some readers may indeed be have a problem with that. However, he wins thoroughly by taking the argument to the fundamentalists - and in doing so, dimantles the whole foundation of Christianity . Read it and be awakened!"
5,"Useful, keep it by the front door.","I have actually read this book, and I recommend you keep it handy to debate door-to-door evangelists. I now invite them into my home and sit down and talk with them. Using McKinsey's book, I have yet to lose an argument about the bible. I am amazed at how many people are able to shrug off the problems and fall back on ""God said it, I believe it, that settles it"" in spite of the fact that McKinsey rarely (if ever) goes outside the bible to prove it false. As he says in the EBE ""...the Bible is its own worst enemy."" One need only to read Genesis with an open mind to see this. It seems some people are able to take one weak argument from McKinsey's book and claim it invalidates the entire book, yet the bible has hundreds of mistakes in it that somehow are irrelevent. The EBE has mistakes in it, but Mr. McKinsey doesn't claim to be infallible, he leaves those claims to the fundementalists."
5,The definitive reference for Biblical studies,"If you can only own one book of Biblical study and/or commentary, this is the one to have. Every topic is thoroughly, comprehensively explored.If I were to offer any criticism, I would say that the author sometimes comes across as too polemical, which may add fuel to the fire of a fundamentalist dead-set on judging the book on author bias alone. If you're trying to persuade someone, it does no good to insult the very person you're trying to persuade. Be that as it may, however, the author's tone in no way diminishes the facts he uncovers.Although there are two indexes at the back of the book, both word- and scripture-, one thing I thought may have been helpful would have been a topical scripture index listing all the relevant scriptures under one subject heading.These two items aside, this book was very good. It made me wonder how and why I ever believed in the Bible in the first place."
3,A little Over-Kill but a worth while look.,"A found this book to be reference book for contradictions in the bible. It is a down and dirty aproach which might be offensive to beleivers. Probably a more compasionate aproach would be a better angle, but I am a proud owner of this book."
3,Bland,"A rather straight forward narrative of the first American expedition to the Pamirs in the former Soviet Russian in the 70's. A lot of death on this expedition, but the telling of it is rather bland. Overall uninteresting unless you are interested in the history of mountaineering. Roskelley and Jeff Lowe were on this expedition."
4,Good read.,"It all starts with Jean St. Michel when he is sixteen-years-old. Infamous Nadia Petrovna sets her choreographer's sights on young Michel. Her choreographer, Charles Crown, is considered talented, but dangerous, within the dancing art circles. But Michel can't afford Crown. At least not until a certain letter arrived.Jonni Kendal is determined to be an actress. When she and Michel get together, sparks fly. But it is not all rosy. Both, especially Michel, will be pushed to their very limits... Perhaps beyond.**** Author Rebecca Horsfall takes the glamorous life of the arts, strips it down to its harsh reality, and presents it to you, the reader. See what the world of art is really like. At the same time, you will cheer characters on as they reach for the stars. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
5,life saver,"I almost gave up breastfeeding because my nipples were just raw and cracked and the pain when he would nurse was horrible, I would be in tears while he ate. little did i know , he was not latched on all the way. At my one-week doctor visit, i was introduced to this shield, my only question is.....WHY DIDN'T THEY SHOW ME THIS TO BEGIN WITH????????? buying one for my best friend so she can be successful without pain!!!"
2,Poor results,this product just did not produce much of a change that I could find so I felt disappointed very much so.
4,"Lingering, detailed view of women's lives","If you like films which aren't rushed but take time to slowly reveal the people within them, you might just like this one - as I did. Rather than telling one main story, this movie reveals several different stories, each one centering on a particular woman. There's Holly Hunter playing a bank manager who unexpectedly finds herself 6 weeks pregnant and decides not to have the baby, Glenn Close as a doctor who isn't as together as she appears to the outside world, Calista Flockhart as a tarot card reader, etc. The subtle interactions between these women and the gradual unfolding of their lives made this film an absolute delight to me."
2,Pointless,"A brief snapshot of five blonde-on-blonde women, in a washed-out world of self-absorbed affluence, each staring vacantly off to the horizon as the world goes on around them. Even the two women that have emotional connection with other people are still wooden robots, silent witnesses to another's anguish, and then they they go about their day.Nothing happens. You get a bit of the source of their emptiness. Then it's over. The end."
5,great flick,I rented this not knowing I had seen the last half one late night probably on IFC. Wow now I get all the connections. Really good flick
1,Things you would hate just by watching this movie,"Great actors, that can't be denied. But a horrific movie. Boring, shallow, self-absorbed people making dull, obvious choices to leave empty lives. Get a group of people together and see if there is any plot ""twist"" you can't predict. Pretentious, obvious and insipid.But did I mention the actors are great?"
2,Give this as a gift to someone you hate,"I decided to get this movie because it was on sale at a local store and I saw that it had 4 stars here at [amazon.com] I thought it would be a good movie to watch with my girlfriend...whoops!The movie had no meaning for me. I thought maybe female viewers would relate to the movie better, but even my girlfriend wished she hadn't wasted her time watching this movie. We were really depressed after we finished it. The stories in the movie could've been interesting but were too slow. On the plus side, the cast was great.The video quality wasn't good for a DVD but the audio was decent. There were a couple of times I turned my head because I thought the sound was real.There are no extras on this DVD except for the theatrical trailer.Not a recommended purchase."
1,Just put your head in an oven,"I thought this movie was TERRIBLE. Oh, the cast is fantastic but the story lines suck. They lead no-where, just like the pathetic and joyless lives of these women. These women's lives haven't ""turned a corner"", as one reviewer suggested, they just went to sleep after a terrible day(s). Not a single thread gets resolved, questions are raised, but never answered. And PLEASE, the ""wise bag lady"" cliche! Have the writers ever been close to a real homeless person? I seriously doubt it. This was one of the worst and most pointless movies I've ever seen. Save your money (and your time) and get something with some life in it."
4,A pretty brooch,A very pretty brooch that I wore to school as a visual to describe symmetry. One student even stated that she wanted to steal it. Definitely a lovely addition to my pin collection.
3,"NOT a Review of Hugo`s Novel, nor the Movie","This is NOT a review of Victor Hugo`s NOTRE DAME OF PARIS, which is an exciting, intriguing, and heartrendering novel on its own. Read it if you`re old enough. Justine Korman and company, however, have performed the amazing feat of condensing a substantial Disney animated movie, which in turn is based on the novel, into a short (under 30 pages, most of whose space is filled with images from the film) and simple version for children. A pleasant souvenir of the movie."
4,"Perfect for a quick, easy bathroom makeover","I bought this wall kit to cover the tile surround in my bathroom. The tiles were really really difficult to keep clean & I decided to try this kit & its worked out very well. Its easy to install & easy to keep clean. This is a very basic kit that comes with 4 separate panels, so if you are looking for a more expensive looking solution, a solid tub surround would be better. But for a small budget & a quick fix, this is an easy to care for choice."
5,Economical and easy to install.,I bought this Jiffy Tub Wall Kit to install around an older bath tub that couldn't be fitted with a standard size surround without doing some major remodeling. It was easy to install and easy on my wallet. I'm very satisfied with this product.
3,"Ugly, but functional","I bought this because I needed a quick, cheap, temporary solution. This thing is ugly even by the already low standards of multi-part tub liners.If $60 is all you can budget at the moment or if you really want to tile but don't have the time to spare right now, this item does at least allow you to take showers until you come upon better circumstances. Mine has been in use for about four months now and are doing fine, but its days are numbered."
3,Egon Schiele by Erwin Mitsch,"Usually love Phaidon books but was irritated by numbers of blank pages in this book. Would rather have seen more of his paintings and was dissapointed to find that several favourites weren't included whereas many unfinished sketches were. I also disliked the fact that information about the painting, such as size, medium was not given next to it (despite a blank page beside every one and loads of white space surrounding them!). Instead I had to look this up in a separate index at the back, each time. Also dissapointing, was the fact that there were no close-up views of the paintings at all. Some of Scheile's paintings are huge and when reproduced at a size that will fit on one page, much of the detail is lost.However, it's still a lovely book and I did enjoy it."
4,"Good, but Orbital has done better","Despite being a good album, I was disappointed with Diversions. After getting Middle of Nowhere and In-Sides, I was hoping for a little more out of this older album. From what I had heard, as far as Orbital goes the older the better, but that doesn't hold true in my book. If you're new to orbital, I'd recommend Middle of Nowhere as your first choice. If you're looking for some more good quality but not mind blowing Orbital, diversions is an excellent choice."
3,pretty good remixes...,"i love track # 2... that track has a strong vibe... i don't know why, but it feels really strong and, perhaps, sadly triumphant. i really Njoy this cd for that song. its one of a few from the john peel sessions.the fyrechyld/"
4,"""Sophie"" is Choice","This album is a collection of demos, covers, and more of a wonderful score. When you hear the tunes, you wonder how it could have failed. The score is witty, tuneful, and above all, fabulously rendered. It also features some great versions of three of the songs sung by Steve Allen and Judy Garland. If you are a musical buff, this is highly recommended."
2,Wanted: Editor for Photoshop Book,"Don't get me wrong...There is a ton of useful information in this book. The included CD has a great collection of images that really make the lessons work.But this guy is a horrible writer. That's not his fault. The floggings should begin with the editors. (Which begs the question: Were there editors? Some are listed, but what did they do?)I don't mind dense text, when it knows where it's going. But being verbose on the excuse of being conversational just doesn't make it. Also, there are no conventions used in the text to help you navigate. Remember -- the reader will be splitting his/her attention between screen, book, and maybe some scribbled notes. Text conventions like bold-face for commands, different font for filenames, etc., can go a long way.I'm using it in a university course right now, and the instructor feels compelled to explain what the book is trying to explain. That just aint right."
2,Poor Print Job,"I have purchased and used 3 previous versions of this book, the material and quality was excellent, but this version was rushed to press and the illustrations are unreadable, I contacted the authors and publisher and there response was that they will correct it in the next edition. I would not purchase this book till the printing is corrected."
2,Confusing!!,"I'm currently using this book for a digital imaging and video class. I agree with others, the writing is not good at all!! Its confusing and the instructions are poorly written. Half of it doesn't work. Maybe its because I'm using CS2? Who knows but I dont like this book!"
1,Dark side of story wasn't developed!,"Time should have been spend developing the relationship between the characters. The concept was good, but the overall plot wasn't executed as one would expect. If you are going to write about the dark side of anyone, you should make the reader feel it. That didn't happen here. Overall, the story was weak, but because of the writing, I would probably buy the authors next attempt."
3,Somebody Help Us,"Please, somebody, write a book that does not have 250 pages of two guilt ridden women having nightmare issues, being exhausted (all the time), needing food, feeling they are not good enough for each other and of course the ever present elderly, wise, advice toting grand mother character. This book had the girls sleeping (in each others arms of course) WAY too much.The only one of these uber stories that did not get old after the 1st chapter was the trilogy about Ice and Angel.The action was good, but not enough of it and way too mushy.We want adventure and some new story lines!!"
5,What could be better?,"What could be better than Peanuts comics? This book is great, full of the comic strips. A fun read that doesn't need to be read all in the same sitting. =)"
3,it's okay,Got it for my son. It wasn't as good as earlier writings I had as a kid. He prefers my old Charlie Brown books as well.
4,Great gift for my husband,"Elegant, sturdy warmer set. My husband loved it. Only wish the snifter was a bit bigger, but its pretty cool."
3,Image is NOT exactly what you get,"UPDATE!My review was for a Dec 2010 purchase. As of Dec 2011, the change in design has finally reached the notice of Amazon's illustration.What you see is not EXACTLY what you get!The style of the holder I received (as of Dec 2010) has changed.The base is a four prong legs, not a flat ring as shown, and makes the whole thing look quite insect-like. Also there is no 'handle' that the image shows to the far right.Glass clarity and quality of both the snifter and the candle holder (which rocks about in the metal frame) is medium to mediocre.Wire frame is composed of sturdy metal, with solder between them.Label on the box is ""Wine Enthusiast""I got this as a gift for my Father (a wine aficionado) who appreciated it, but it looks a bit out of place on any table, perhaps too gadgetry.See my added picture to illustrate the different design that I received, the sellers need to change lead picture."
4,product is only ONE set,"I just recieved my package today way earlier than expected which was nice. The product is undamaged and and looks new.. the brandy (snifter) glass is HUGE !! I though it was a lot smaller, but I'm deffenetly not complaining about that.... However, I did believe that the purchase would bring FOUR glasses & warmers.. I was not correct.. even though it clearly states : >>""Brandy Warmer 4-Piece Gift Set""<< it kinda sounds like your getting 4 ""sets""... It actually means 4 pieces in the 1 set... Being the snifter glass itself, the glass holder, the candle holder, and the candle.... I guess I should of asked the seller first 2make sure..... Overall I am happy, but I deffenetly would of liked to get 4 sets of them instead of just 1 set...."
1,Beware: Misleading description,"The title says 4-piece set, I expected four glassesYou get ONEThe four ""pieces"" are: the glass, the tea candle, the candle holder, the standI noticed that the box doesn't use the misleading phrase ""4-piece set"" only the seller's description"
3,Nor here or there,"I got the set for my husband's birthday, and it was very disappointing. Although the product is cute - much smaller than I imagined - it was broken. I didn't notice until he opened the gift package. It was wrapped well, but the glass might be too thin and easily breakable. I was able to return it and got a refund for it."
3,Good quality but takes forever to warm the liquor,"Good quality snifter and stand. But I think the candle may be set too far from the snifter - browning the snifter with the flame would not be good, but it takes forever to warm.Still, I use it, I just have to plan ahead for when I want my warmed Frangelico."
3,Decent gift,"My friend liked the gift, but I thought the snifter was a little too small, and the holder does not hold bigger ones. However, still a decent gift."
3,BOY MEETS BOY reissued on CD: A Gem In The Rough,"The original off-off Broadwayproduction of BOY MEETS BOYwas quite a landmark in it's time. Aside from featuring a bright and energetic cast framed by crisp and colorful Art Deco sets, the show managed to present it's theme of a boy/boy relationship in an elegant, romantic and almost Noel Cowardian way.The original cast recordingis quite good on the whole butsuffers from low-budget production values. Bill Solly's score is for the most part melodious and cleverwith only one number verging on inept..(""Clarence's Turn"")All in all I'm delighted to see BOY MEETS BOY on CD but I feel that without having witnessedthe show first-hand, most people might find it a bit difficult to relate to the recording."
3,Useful but cheap,The brush works but the case is very thin and it dented within the first two weeks of normal use.
3,Hot Pink not Red,"It's hot pink in color (not red) but still very pretty, and it's sturdy enough. The brush tip itself is white in color, firm and much thinner than than expected (for a lip brush) but works very well for lining (shaping/defining) not so much for filling, which would be easier with a thicker brush. It's okay but not exactly what I expected."
2,disappointed,The brush is very very very precise small brush. It really doesn't deserve all this money !! !! !! !!
1,Disappointed,"This might be a good book if you're Trustee of a multi-million dollar estate, with multiple stocks, million-dollar properties, and yachts. It was not useful for my situation, which I couldn't determine from the description and reviews. If the estate is that complicated and that much money is involved, I'd get an attorney. It would be worth it."
1,ummm....wtf?,"Trying to rehash the glorious moments of sascha konietzko's KMFDM in which these folks played the role of side-men, this record is an utter abortion. The lamest programming ever, the guitar sounds like it was recorded in the woods somewhere, the vocals and most especially the lyrics a laughable attempt at what ??? exactly.Amazon's editorial review is full of lies.En esch and gunter were NOT founding members of KMFDM,Gunter came into play in '89 and en esch (klause schandelmeyer) was in the band not before late '85. KMFDM formed in early '84 however.It is amazing to me that slick idiot could put out an album even worse than their first one, dicknitty. but this is definitely MUCH worse.Ddon't waste your money on this record."
5,Well worth the wait!!!,"Slick Idiot has done it again! They've managed to pull off another great record despite their hardships. This album was not what I had expected,... AND I'M GLAD!!! That's what keeps it real and keeps it fun! The whole album has a great ""flow"" and keeps you interested becuase each song is so unique; sometimes heavy, sometimes funky, always fun and always fresh with subtle hints of their ""past"" sprinkled in.When Esch and Guenter left KMFDM, I could tell where KMFDM got a lot of their uniqueness because there's sort of a void there now.So pick up SCREWTINIZED, not for a flashback of KMFDM, but for a new, refreshing sound to break up the monotony of ANY music collection a bit. Nothin' but praise for this album! (Hopefully, a tour will follow!)"
3,Not KMFDM,"If your buying this album looking to hear KMFDM you wont. Its something new and different. I wouldent really call it worse than the 1st album, just different. Personally im not to fond of this album simply because some of the songs arent my style. Im not critisizing Slick Idiot and saying they suck, I still love the band and several songs om the CD which is why I give it 3 stars. If you want to try something new go for this album."
3,Disappointing,"I was looking really forward to this release and expected a lot. Their first album, DickNity, was spectacular! One of my favorite all time albums. When I finally heard Screwtinized I was disappointed; I expected it to be along the same style as DickNity. However; there are a few tracks on the album that I really enjoy. It isn't a complete waste of money. My suggestion, though would be to buy Slick Idiot's first album instead. Or, Güenter Schulz's other preject Schultz: What Apology?. (Check out schulzmusic.com). If you already have those, whatever.Slick Idiot is a group started by two former members of the industrial giant group: KMFDM; En Esch and Güenter Schulz. (Personally, I like the direction Slick Idiot is going more than KMFDM) After breaking up with KMFDM in 1999, they went on to do various cover songs, and whatnot, then formed up Slick Idiot a few years ago. If you like KMFDM from the 90s, you'll love Slick Idiot."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!,"If you are looking for the original Sunshine Woodspice, this isn't it. The photo is of the original and i even called the company to confirm it was the original and not Sunshine Spa. I was assured it was and the photo was correct.What was delivered was the foul smelling Sunshine Spa. This is blatant bait and switch.Don't Bother!"
3,Very impresive,I think this book was very interesting I couldn't stop reading it . It was shoking how many problem a person can have. Vienee just has to take it easy everthing will be ok.
2,keshia's review,The book was okay. It could have been better. I only liked the ending of the book. It was mainly about vivienne and her three friends who all had problems. They solved their problems by staying strong.
2,keshia 5th period cleaning closet,This book was okay. I rated it a 2 because it confused me. The stories kept jumping from person to person. It was good at the ending. I think that books that are somewhat true are good but thi one was okay. I liked the part when they reunited at the end of the book. A lot of college friends don't try to reunite with each other after so many years. This book showed how 4 women with their own problems survived by staying strong.
4,Ham Seasoning,This seasoning is fantastic! I've put it in peas and it's great! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to see a lower sodium version. Other than that I highly recommend it and will buy it again.
4,Great Value!,"I have seen this tv and tried it out in a store and i can tell you that this is one of the best tv's i have ever seen under [price]. The sound works great, realistic, and the picture quality is average. If you want cheap value from a reliable brand, this is the tv to choose."
4,Witty and Romantic!,"This book was a fun, light read. The hero and heroine fought all the time in way that makes you love them even more. If you are looking for a somber, serious read look elsewhere. But if you want a light, hilarious, clean regency that is full of romantic tension, try Duel of Hearts."
5,"A fast-paced, can't-put-down kind of book!","I read this book based on its ""desert isle keeper"" status at allaboutromance.com and was certainly not disappointed at all. The story is very fast-faced, a real page turner indeed. The main characters of Drake and Lilah are over-the-top funny and definitely are at a battle of wills. They think that their strong attraction to one another is something to be repressed and that their ideal mates must be submissive types. They fight tooth and nail not to get together and seeing them fight the strong, undeniable attraction is hilarious. It wasn't until the last page that I realized that there were no love scenes, yet I felt the characters passion much more than any more graphic stories I might have read recently. I absolutely adored Drake and Lilah and will defnitely be keeping this one."
2,a teenage romance,"Diane Farr writes in her usual elegant style, but quite wastes her talents in a teenage romance set, for some inexplicable reason, in the regency period (not that we see much of it besides the dresses). The two main protagonists meet and quarrel their way towards marriage, and while this is amusingly written (if a bit repetitive), I was often quite bored with their antics. It is hard to believe that Drake is in his late twenties, and Lilah of age (21 at least), because throughout the book they are depicted as so incredibly self-centered and stupidly immature that I found nothing whatsoever to empathize with - one of the joys I expect from reading a romance. As I said, this might have been more acceptable had Diane Farr written a teenage romance between a 19-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl and marketed it as such."
1,horrible....,"I hate to be so harsh but this book is horrible.While I make many allowances for accuracy (or lack thereof) in a historical romance, SOME inaccuracies cannot be ignored.When an author so blatantly ""rewrites"" the behaviors and speech of characters in a historical period as to be laughable then I'll be the first to say skip this book. This is the case here.I quit the book by page 30. By then we know the heroine is a spoiled, supposed upper crust lady who treats her servants terribly. The hero, an EARL, is beyond rude, leers at her and calls her a brat when they first meet in a tavern, even after he knows she's a lady of quality and doesn't even know her name! Even if she was a peasant-no Earl would ever talk to someone the way Miss Farr has her male lead speaking and behaving.Another reviewer points out the obvious immaturity of the book and I wholeheartedly agree! Do yourself a favor and skip this book.1 star for a pretty cover."
2,encourages the lying deceiving monkey in all of us,"Being involved with German programs I have seen this film twice. The constant theme of cheating on one's partner is useless entertainment that is embarrassing to watch. The movie may give you some insight to German society of the DDR, but otherwise it just lowers the intelligence of the viewer.Watch Goodbye Lenin, or Mephisto, or anything with quality instead."
4,Oidos sordos para la mente del inocente,"Entre otras cosas esta pelicula refleja la buena disposicion y la inocensia de una niña con un modo de pensar muy particular. la historia refleja la situacion economica de el pais (mexico) y su impacto en la familia de clase media-alta (que porsupuesto se devaluo a media baja) en el 92. Pero esta pelicula no es solo una historia de la situacion economica sino mas bien la historia de una inocente, noble e inteligente niña que peco de inocensia. Es tambien una critica a la cultura mexicana en especial a la forma en que los padres inconcientemente ignoran la psicologia infantil. Interesante y divertida pero para los avitantes de la gran ciudad, perturbadora.TQMGEDP"
3,Get what you pay for.,"Not a high end micrometer by any means, but for the money it works just fine. Best priced micrometer I have seen. Great buy for a large group of users. Downside - to adjust to zero you have to spin the bezel. Could cause problems if users don't pay attention to bezel position before using."
4,Paper thickness gauge,We use the gauge for determining paper thickness used in the early manufacture of postage & revenue stamps - the thickness can mean the value difference from a few dollars to $1000's. The product is robust & appears to accurately measure paper thickness - it is too early to give a resounding opinion but all indications are that the product will provide years of good accurate service.
3,My own fault,I should have bought up. This works but needs to sit level to measure which is not always an option.
2,Initially intriguing but ultimately cloying,"Sometimes the lack of critical distance in online reviews compels me to chip in with a two-star spoiler, if only to temper the five stars rashes that seem to be endemic. When first viewed, Katchor's work has an engagingly ethereal quality: crude yet strikingly filmic illustrations are underpinned by liltingly meandering Magic Realist musings. After a few pages, however, the subtle charm becomes smug, narrative rhythms begin to seem like simple repetitiveness and the whole enterprise appears flimsy and self-satisfied. I realise that these are separate newspaper strips not originally intended for consumption en masse but I still found the collection as a whole to be disappointing and ultimately rather irritating."
4,You can only get it here,"Ben Katchor's eerie cityscapes evoke the ruins of the kind of world that appeared to be happening in the background of 1950's films noir, and his fanciful industries, charities, and fraternal organizations hearken back to the same imagined time. Reading his work, one becomes nostalgic for a time that never existed. This form of humor is subtle. In fact, it is not the humor for which I buy Katchor's work as much as it is for that strange feeling of fictional nostalgia. You can get humor anywhere, but Katchor's world view is unique to the man himself. If you ever get jaded, remember this review: immersing yourself in a book of Katchor's is unlike anything you've ever felt before."
5,The Great Depression,"Again as an educator, this is just another teaching tool for me; I wanted my students to experience that era so I TOOK THEM THERE! And once again when they put their thoughts on paper, I could plainly see they enjoyed the educational trip.I suggest to many educators out there, if you want to really get your point across about any topic - don't just say it with notes, show it and then discuss your notes; you will not ""lose"" one student's attention - trust me on this."
3,The Panic i On,"Was interesting, but we liked other video about the depression that we ordered better. ('The Great Depression', and that one was longer and cheaper.) It did have a couple of short movies at the end that were worth watching."
4,Lie to Me - KDrama DVD,"To be perfectly honest, the first time I started watching this Kdrama, I didn't get beyond the bee scene...After watching Yoon Eun Hye in Goong and Coffee Prince, I decided to try it again. Glad I did. It's become one of my favorite lite entertainment dvds. There is a lot of chemistry between Yoon Eun Hye and Kang Ji Hwan, and the soundtrack has a couple of great tunes on it. Of course the Cola kiss scene is great, in fact this kdrama really bends the staid boundaries on kissing on screen. Its a nice change, without it getting overdone. The supporting cast was great, and the story silly but showed how lies, jealousy, avarice, and greed all lead to a slippery slope if you aren't careful. I think it was nicely done for the genre and plan to watch it again soon."
1,Great actors completely wasted,"The lead actors are great and do their best to make the show work, but even their palpable chemistry can't float this leaden boat.The first few episodes are great and set a quick and lively tone of what happens when a little lie becomes a big misunderstanding and both sides feel aggrieved. Lie to Me starts out so well that it makes the sudden downfall into a complete muck of a plotless mishmash even sadder.Yoon Eun Hye is stellar in the deservedly popular 1st Shop of the Coffee Prince. Kang Ji Hwan is great in Hong Gil Dong. Watch those instead and pass on this one."
2,watch it for free on netflix,"lived in Hawaii for 10 years where korean drama was always FREE .. PCS to Kentucky, never in my life would spend $20 plus on Korean dramas... Well Im satisfied netflix customer because i can watch all these Korean Dramas for free... Go on netflix!"
3,You could have lied to me more,"One reviewer's comment ""cute but not much else"" sums it up. If it had gone the all-out comedy route, like Seinfeld - a lie leads to another lie, clueless side-characters propagate the confusions even further and things go out of control - it would have been great. Instead after the promising initial setup, it just goes the same-old-Korean-soap route: persistent and manipulative old flame comes back from a foreign country (at least it is not US this time. It is France!), a disapproving mother figure intervenes, so on and so forth. There is not much development in sub-plots and side-characters either.The actors are all attractive, especially Yun Un-Hye, and it could have been a whole lot better but instead it just feels like yet another recycled story. Unless you are a die-hard fan of melodrama and/or these actors, it gets old after a while."
3,Lie To Me Korean Drama,"One of my favorite korean dramas, but this DVD omitted some scenes and the english translations were not that good. Probably because it was a cheaper copy of the drama ($12.00)."
5,delicious!,The meals that I have prepared so far are delicious! Can't wait to continue making more meal from this book!
3,Big Nothing,"Punisher crosses paths with an old army colleague from `Nam who went from killing US soldiers, stuffing their bodies with drugs, and shipping them back to the US avoiding customs, to doing more or less the same thing without the bodies and on a larger scale.This a book from 1989 and isn't a bad story but having read the far superior series written by Garth Ennis, the Punisher of this book is very amateurish and dated. Castle gets captured by Cambodian drug dealers and gets beaten up by his army buddy who really shouldn't be able to considering he was only a supply sergeant and Castle has dedicated himself to being the Punisher. And then there's the classic Punisher outfit that you couldn't get away with today (those white booties!).Not a terrible book but a very minor one in the canon of the Punisher. Good title, but average story and art, more of a footnote in Frank Castle's history. ""Return to Big Nothing"" is far from a must-read and only for Punisher fans."
4,Not original cast but Gertie is Great.,"In my opinion this CD sounds like a copy of one of Gerties shortened radio show Versions, though I am not certain.She did 30 min and 45 minute verions of all of her plays on her radio show she had in the 40's-50's. The talking part of this CD is excellent and Gertie, and the supporting cast are great. The script is very funny, very witty with an interesting plot. And Gertie is hysterically funny in certain scenes,She is the best in this kind of many faceted role of Liza. But the Music parts are shortened Versions and the sound quality is terrible though Gertie's singing is fine. so buy this CD if you want to capture Gertie and her acting talents, but if you are a Music conisseur forget it it's terrible."
1,Lousy Lady,"Don't go near this. It's a third-rate recording of a fifth rate Radio Show. Orchestrations are soupy, badly played, and terribly mixed - often drowning out the singers. It's all talk - good but dated talk with"" Jenny"" sandwiched in. If you're expecting to hear show tunes, with Broadway zip and sparkle - then this ain't for you."
1,the music sounds muffled and muddy; speaking voices OK,"My advice is to stay away from this CD at all costs. Although the speaking segments are OK, the music sounds like a defective record from the 30's."
3,Meglio per me,"There is no reason to skip the first song! It is a tribute to Ayrton Senna, the F1 driver who was killed at Imola, and is very heartfelt. On the other hand, this is the album that finally converted me to accepting Dalla. (And I fought hard not to like him)"
3,"A good album,though not as inspired as Dalla's previous work","Canciones is a superb song, full of rythm and beat. If you don't know Dalla, I would suggest to start with ""Bugie"" or ""Viaggi Organizzati"" not with this one."
3,Not exactly what i wanted,this toy isn't what i wanted because it doesn't work as a tent it leaves small room for playing in. i don't really reccommend it.
3,Not what I expected,This toy is not what I had expected. It isn't very durable at all and it's HARD to put together! I don't highly recommend it.
2,SpongeBob Junk Pants!,This sleeping bag is NOT worth the money. The tent part is very flimse and tears up easily. The sleeping bag itself was nearly destroyed after I washed it.
2,Not worth the time or money,"This playhut was very frustrating for our children. My children enjoyed it when it was left in the slumber position. Our trouble began when we turned it into a tent. The sleeping bag is one side of the tent. It's heavy so it sags leaving little room for children to play. After about ten minutes, the playhut was turned over and on the ground. We returned it..."
3,"toot is great, wiggly bay is boring","wiggly bay is really badtoot toot chuga chuga chuga big red car, it travels near and it travels far. That's wonderful.This was an unfortunate choice of packaging. I don't know if toot toot by itself is worth the price. I would say that wiggly bay is probably the weakest of all our beloved wiggley movies"
3,Good,"It's small and good. But initial days, very confusing. It's not helpful in the nights. You will really not guess where the vehicle is. And looking regular mirror and again into blind spot, you will not get good idea in the night based on vehicle lights appear in both the mirrors."
4,True to product details,Product was exactly what I expected. The rotating feature is really handy when outcomes to installing. Good for blind spots.
5,works as expected,"This works great, sticks to the mirror with adhesive strip, adjusts etc. One per car is probably enough...on the driver's side..."
1,what?,What is this DVD? NO information and it comes up as music in the cart... I dumped it from my cart because I already have mind wave music... DESCRIBE IT!
5,A worthy space opera,"Drake can be a spotty author, with a tendency toward overly graphic violence and language and a sloppy sense of continuity. None of that detracts from this book, which is the best (along with companion novel ""With the Lightnings"" which should be read first) of recent space opera (meaning the last couple of Weber or Moon novels.) Engaging characters, interesting non-military themes (library and data science, natural history) running through the books, and rollicking adventure. Also the only really engaging space battle I have ever read. A homage to Aubrey and Maturin that works and is a great addition to Drake's canon."
4,A Rip off of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series,"Normally, I can't stand Drake's writing because I can't get to know or like his characters. This series different, Lt Leary is perfect as the dashing shipmaster Capt Aubrey and Officer Mundy superb as the ingenious (and clumsy) Dr. Maturin. Drake remained true to Mr. O'Brians swashbuckling series set during Napoleonic Wars... I loved it and hope for many more books. Complicated plot, heavy on the action and weak on the character... just like O'Brian. I am really amazed at how the role of the communications officer was so integral to the mission! I think I'll start on Belisarius series next. Mr. Drake is growing on me."
3,Good (Space) Sailor's Yarn,"This book contains good space sailor's yarn: Leary & Mundy are in space again and fighting for their Republic of Cinnabar, a cross between old pre-Caesar Rome and early Imperial Britain.However the characters hardly evolve. We learn about Daniel Leary's skills in sailing the matrix and Adele Mundy's in retrieving data from enemies, but they don't have to face their nightmares and find inner strength like in With the Lightnings"".The plot is without much depth, its basically the two heroes going on with their business. A lot of potentially interesting sub-plots get started but somehow get lost. The story ark seems to evolve slowly but then ends with a quick bang as if the author had to speed up to meet a time-table.But again: good yarn. Easy reading for a long flight or after-work hours. And with the characters of Leary & Mundy the potential for a great series is there. I'll look forward for the next book."
1,"Lt. Leary, Commanding","As a David Drake fan who reads a wide variety of fiction, I am very disappointed in this effort. It is so close to the character portraits and tone of Patrick O'Brians ""Master and Commander"" from his outstanding Aubrey and Maturin series as to be almost a direct steal. Not one of his better efforts."
4,Worth the wait,"I can't get enough of this group since they reinvented themselves in 2000 as the epitome of acoustic/acid jazz.Jazzhole is simply one of the best bands extant. Their music is always TRULY soulful, warm, sexy, inviting, soothing, inspiring, and calming.It had been 4 years since their last set and ""Poet's Walk"" was more than worth the wait. From the stroll-in-the-park-with-your-mate instrumental title track to the opium-laced blue light reading of Take Your Time to the joyous bossanova of It Would Have Been Enough, this brief album is rock solid, top-to-bottom. The tracks range from good to exceptional.""Poet's Walk"" is perfect for a romantic evening, a small get-together, or just winding down. This is as real as it gets."
3,"it's pretty good,but i wasn't feeling the covers","i've always dug me some Jazzhole&this album as with there previous musical offerings has versatility&balance of styles,vibes&moods. my major knock here is that the covers on here just don't do it for me. ""Low Down"" Boz Scaggs Cover ain't working here. same thing with the SOS Band's ""take your time do it right"". I needed some Bar B Que Flavored funk on that&this Cover version gets the Microwave treatment which takes all the flavor away. but other than those two bumps in the road this is a cool listening Album. I always enjoy the vocals&overall arrangements."
4,Crazy for Coflex,I love coflex. This stuff is an amazing wrapping material that bonds to itself and not your hands or clothes. Works great. I would recommend this product
5,War and Peace,"In a world of increasing violence, we need this book more than ever. We need it to remind us of the consequences of war and those left behind in the tragic aftermath. What surprised me most was the hope that some of the stories and poems deliver. Buy this book! And give it as a gift to anyone considering joining the military."
4,"Veterans of War, Veterans of Peace","As a professional counselor who has dealt with veterans and their issues for the past 24 years, I found this book very tantalizing. In their own words, the memories, hauntings and overall experiences were stated in as they recall them, and expressed as healings to those experiences few, if any who are not warriors, will ever experience.I learned of this book on Mn Public Radio, with the author speaking on behalf of herself and those who participated in this exercize. I recommend this to anyone who knows a combat veteran, or someone who may merely have experienced a traumatic or series of traumatic events. My hats off to the veterans who contributed, and who shared some of their own naked experiences. Thanks so much for your sacrifice, and may peace be found in your lives."
2,Pointless,"First of all, I loved Crossing California. I thought it was a beautifully written and insightful slice of an era. That being said, this book is really pointless. The characters are no longer new and fresh and the whole novel feels forced. Why did the author not leave well enough alone? If he had something new to say, this could be excused. But the book seems to have no reason to exist except to make money."
1,A Disappointment,"What a disappointment. Crossing California was a wonderful book, full of interesting characters rooted in a specific time and neighborhood of Chicago. Washington Story reads as if Langer's publisher asked for another book just like the first, demanded it within a 6 month time period, and then didn't take the time to have it edited. This book should have been reduced by several 100 pages, whole story lines cut out. It rambles and makes pointless references to historical events and places in Chicago. The central story is forced and unsatisfying. This may be an overly harsh review, but I expected so much more after Crossing California!"
4,one of my favorites,"I like a color that stands out, and not many pens write green. I get comments when I use this green. A couple of my fountain pens work better with this ink than with black Higgins ink --maybe because it might be a little thinner ink? I'm having fun with this color anyway..."
3,A Good Historical CD,"Even though this is a very helpful CD for understanding what the show was like, there is a lot of dialouge and not much music. So for those who are expecting a CD full of song and music be aware that it is like listening to a play on CD with musical interludes. That said it is still worth buying, as the recording will make an impression."
5,Accessible Poetry,"I have never been much of a poetry reader--mostly because I have often found it to be obtuse or irrelevant. My opinion changed, though, after reading Eric Shaffer's work. I loved PORTABLE PLANET (his first collection of poems), and LIVING IN THE MONASTERY, WORKING IN THE KITCHEN was even better! His poetry is fresh, humorous and filled with simple images that manage to evoke complex emotions. ""Will good and evil deeds be weighed?/Who ponders such nonsense is lost."" -- simple truth, eloquently stated. Buy this book and forget your preconceived notions about poetry. Eric Shaffer will blow them out of the water!"
3,"Grate look, but a few problems.","Well the look is grate, they are really detailed but i dont like the fact that the aliens mouth has to be open at all times.Allso i think its stupid that the Predators arm can fall off. You cant hardly touch the Predator at all without his arm falling off. Allso you cant make the Predator stand normaly. He allways has to stand the way he stands on the picture. Allso it does not help that the characters cant really stand up on their own.But like i said they do look grate."
5,the best...toy there is,this toy is the coolest most funthigh you cood have i have the whole colection of predator and alien toys and out of all of them this one is the best.but they should make it an action figure not a collecter!
4,For fans,"...and for adult childs, is a very good piece of collection, but a little bit fragile (not for REAL childs)...."
4,Sum of the Parts Worth the Wait,"Although this piece is amazingly detailed, it is not as detailed as it was represented on the advertisment. The base looks nice but is very flimsy. The figures themselves do not stand on their pegs and they are not as articulated as I'd like to have seen. Also, to touch on what I read in another review, I think this item would have been better had it come with the Predator's mask."
2,The title is misleading,"The book's title indicates that you will learn specific ways to train for software rollouts, which is not the case. If you have never done any training before it may be helpful, but there are other books out there that are much better. I expected this book to hone in on techniques for software rollouts, which it did not. Overall it was useless for me."
4,Cute little coaster,"This is a set of cute little coasters for your desk or coffee table. The rug design is pleasing. I knocked it down by one star because the non-slip rubber backing smells a bit unpleasant. I've had them for a few months now, and they still smell."
3,Better Then Usual For Alpha,"While still ""collector's quality"", this is a much better print then I would normally expect from Alpha (normally Alpha appears to have little to no quality control; their dvd's often look like they were mastered from a 5th generation VHS copy). Previously hard to find early Bela Lugosi film in MUCH BETTER quality then the public domain dvd's on ebay."
2,Lugosi as Chingachgook,"Bela Lugosi's Chingachgook flashes past but is the best thing in this confused telling of James Fenimore Cooper. Filmed in 1920 in Germany as two features, mashed down to this one-hour cut for 1923 US release. Competently made and occasionally pretty. Brutal abridgement means film often flirts with incoherence, and Emil Mamelok plays Hawkeye like a stolid German burgher. Much energetic canoeing. Lugosi's role is largely cut, but he shines when onscreen. This edition offers a soft 16mm print, ungainly intertitles and no extra features. Essential for Lugosi completists, not without interest for students of early German film, otherwise pass."
5,"Awesome, as usual","Amr Diab doesn't cease to amaze me, he is such a great musician and singer. He has such a way to blend Western beats with Arabic music. I love the songs ""Leily Nahary"" and ""Dayman fi Bely""...in-cre-di-ble! try it, you won't be dissapointed. Actually, there isn't one album that you can dislike from him, really...try his compilations of best hits and latest albums first, though ;)"
4,Great background and technical information on Abys,"As the breed has evolved throughout the years, we can see a marked difference from the Abys detailed in this book to present day trends, but the basic information on care and breeding is very good. The text is easy to read, just technical enough to keep it interesting, and it is obvious Ms. Faler is well versed on her subject. A good reference for the Aby breeder."
2,Yawn,"This Book is EXTREMELY outdated! It was copywrited in 1983 and has not been updated. The pictures of the cats are not even how they look today, let alone the picture of one breeder which makes me laugh by just the thought of their picture. The kittens are similar to a point but the ears on the pictures of this breed of cat seemed to be much smaller back then. Also it says the 'blue' has not been recognized yet and doesn't even mention the fawn colour. It has some relivant information, but for the most part, in 25 years too much has evolved for this book to be useful."
3,morse CD,"CD in great shape well packed and fast shipping. Makes for nice background music when driving. The theme music, while similar to the opening and end credits, is not performed with the same effects, i.e. the Morse code is neither distinct nor dominant enough."
3,Odd compilation of disparate recordings - a recreation.,"Someone loves this minor Rodgers and Hart show enough to attempt to assemble a studio cast recording by grouping popular recordings of most of the songs from the show (four are left out). Since this show has never received a cast album,it does fill a gap, but the score is not one of the team's best (only SPRING IS HERE and I'LL TELL THE MAN IN THE STREET were hits)and the effect is more of an oddity than a joy. For Rodgers and Hart fans only."
3,Not everyone sings like an angel,"I believe the music on this cd is a blending of the music sang by Gordon MacRae and Lucille Norman for a Railroad Hour radio show episode and the cast of a Liberty Music Shop production. Gordon and Lucille did an excellent job!! Their singing was marvelous - Gordon singing with his usual emotional renditions and Lucille with her beautiful clear soprano. Gordon and Lucille's renditions of ""I Married An Angel"" and ""I'll Tell the Man in the Street"" are absolutely gorgeous!! Unfortunately, the other singers on this cd have just average ability and there is a noticeable contrast between the sharp recordings featuring Gordon and Lucille and the scratchier recordings made by the rest of the ""cast."" Without Gordon and Lucille, it is just a fair musical and quite confusing to listen to. It would have been better just putting the complete Railroad Hour episode on the cd."
2,Ok Fit,"Runs a bit large in the waist and are VERY VERY long. i am 5'8 and I have NEVER had to hem jeans like this in the past. Even 4 inch heels weren't tall enough to keep me from having to hem them. They are sitting in the bag, never worn. i am not hemming jeans! A total waste of money!"
5,Exceptional collection. Words. Music. Performance,"As with others in this series (Francis Xavier and Don Quixote), this is an exceptional collection. Several hundred pages of multi-lingual commentary (the English language version was extremely well done). An eclectic collection of period music and words performed in a manner unique to Savalli's recordings and Hesperion. This collection falls within the bounds of true rarities of unusual excellence. As a real fan of early music and history, it takes a special place in my collection alongside those on Don Quixote and the more recent work on Francis Xavier."
5,old school in da bones,"one of my favourite rap albums. raw, powerfull without any anoying extravaganza. just hard knocks on your ears. ""a dirty cop named harry"" is a must have on every rap sampler. i wish there would be more albums like this."
5,EXCELLENT MUSIC!!!!,"I heard this album after I got it for X-mas and I loved it. It's worth every penny. It's so emotional and well written. If you want to hear some good music that can tap onto your emotions, here is the one for you. He is an excellent artist and his music should be enjoyed by everyone."
5,The most slept on golden era record eVeRRrrrrr!!!!,"A true hip-hop fan would either say....""oh yeahhhh i remember Blue Cheese or my personal fav..""One to Grow On"". Kool Kim RIPS his 2 verses on song #1. One to Grow On! Lyrically WAY ahead of his time & it's 2010 & many listeners still hunger for such magnificent word-play. You keep listening in awe as they conquer tracks like Morals, Blue Cheese, Jive Talk with excellent vocals, & dope instrumentals to back them up. ""Never Never Land"" is probably one of the SICKEST tracks & concepts ever recorded for hip-hop. The song sorta like the movie ""Children of the Corn"" displays the concept ""and a child shall lead"". The impact is followed with ""Anyway the Wind Blows"" & its catchy sing-along hook. Finally, jumping into ""It's Gonna Last"" leaves you sad & nostalgic about what the blueprint of ""dope"" music is....Again, if you claim this sacred culture to be yours, then COP this cd!! Nuff said...."
5,a classic when rap was hip hop and not pop,"I had this on tape and lost it in a move. it took a while to finally find it on CD. damn, memories of my youth. I got emotional when my girl pulled the vid on youtube- back in the video music box days on ch39- lol! this album reminded me of why I fell in love with hip hop . It was beautiful, dynamic, real, jazzy. And these guys are not throwing curses every 3 bars. I listen to a lot of Gospel Hip Hop now but this remains one of my favorite albums of the 90's. am I overdoin it? to each his own. Listen and judge for yourself because I STILL bump this and smile. I'm not an ignorant kid anymore - and I hate artists bragging about dope dealin. This reminds me of sunny days and playing in the fire hydrant, staying up at the park playing ball all nite, mom calling me out the window for dinner, when my old neighborhood was a community. Ahhhh memory lane. now go check out diamond d's album and The Fu-Schnickens. Yes u can love hip hop and have fun and be happy!"
5,"excellent album,highly reccomended",this album is one of the best albums that i have heard.i have been looking for years to find this cd and now i guess i have.i reccomend this to anyone into the mellow type of hip-hop.
5,"Overlooked, Underrated and Forgotten","Another 1991 gem that does not get it's due. This group got lost in the sauce for real. Standout joints are Blue Cheese, Morals, One to Grow on, Kraftwerks, It gonna last, and Any way the wind blows."
4,Hip-Hop Classics,"Awesome B-Boy Hip Hop,this early 90's gem comes from an era when jazzy beats and flowing and rhyming with intelligent lyrics were the rule rather than the exception like todays mainstream hip hop, definately a lost classic.If you are a teen or someone in their early twenties who likes Pop Hiphop like Nelly or 50 Cent who seem to only rap about bling,money and shooting people, you probably will not appreciate just what an brilliant album this is."
2,A Very Funny Rip-Off !!,"Let me start by saying that I love Leslie West as a guitar player, always have and always will.Having said that, I have to agree with Pascal; I was expecting an in-depth discussion of West's entire signal-chain, from his strings to his cables, from his effects to his amp settings. I was NOT expecting the Lenny Bruce of guitar players (no offense to Lenny intended), but that's what you'll get if you buy this DVD.The freakin' guy doesn't even let you see the pedals he's got on his pedalboard !!What saves this DVD from getting only one star instead of two is Les' ribald sense of humour. I particularly enjoyed his ""witty banter"" with two Russian pole-dancers from the strip club next door.Bottom line: this DVD is little more that a mediocre Las Legas lounge act featuring a world-class GUITAR PLAYER !?! Forwarned is forearmed -- move on to your next selection and don't look back."
1,Hmmmm...,"I bought this book because of the good reviews it received. I was disappointed. The illustrations where cute. The idea behind the story was good, but it was not carried out very well. When it got to the point of week days jumping off a calendar and talking, I thought this book was a dud."
4,Someday: Is Not A Day of the Week,"A great read (to the class)! The students loved the story and pictures. It's a story to be read over and over again! It helps second language learners understand the differences between the days of the week and ""someday""."
5,The Blonde Bombshell Scores!,"I bought this album as a gift for a friend, and what a shame I didn't buy one for me! There are some real gems on this one, some of the wittiest songs ever written for the silver screen by Frank Loesser and others. (Just check out the wacky distillation of ""Hamlet!"") If you see this disc, grab it!Now, any chance that ""A Square in a Social Circle"" will ever make it to CD?"
5,The all-around best book on pet selection and care,"This book is the most comprehensive guide to animal care and selection that I have ever seen. It lists pets by category: Easy, Difficult and Impossible, and goes to the trouble of explaining why some animals (listed in the ""Impossible"" section) just do not make good pets for the average person. There is also a lot of information on the basic care of the species and covers, in all, somewhere around 84 species. Recommended reading for anyone who loves animals."
1,Impossible pets?,"As someone who works and lives with ""exotic"" animals, I found this book to be full of misinformation, both on anatomical and temperment. I have personal experience with a number of species she has listed, some of her ""facts"" are totally unfounded. Perhaps if you only see these animals in a zoo situation, they may be as troublesome as she contends. However, this is supposed to be about PETS. No, exotics are not for everyone. Yes, you do have to rearrange your life around them. The same holds true about any pet. Several of my friends also read this book, we all felt it was unfairly biased. The hidden agenda seems to be, anything unusual belongs in the wild or a zoo. We share our homes and lives with several ""impossible pets"", amazing how we seem to be surviving and loving it. The title is totally misleading. It is not a guide, but a tirade."
5,The absolute best!,"Our daughter is 18mo old and had thrush 3 times in her first 2mo. We just kept passing the yeast around, she had it orally and vaginally and I had it on my nipples which made breastfeeding even more challenging. She didin't eat for 2 days because her mouth was so sore. I truely feel this spray played a huge part in the elimination of the yeast. It allows you to change the diaper without touching the baby with your bare hand and re-contaminating the tube of cream with your finger. Even if you wash your hands immediately, you still have to tape up the diaper, redress, and hold on to the wiggly baby. unfortunately I can't find this product anywhere locally, it's not avail on-line here, and I'm down to my last spray. If anyone can help, please let me know. Thanks. Evelyn's Mom in Fl.aparilallyear@verizon.net"
3,daily affirmation,"Owen takes some everyday observations about human nature, mixes in common sense and good humor, rejects a few widely held beliefs and delivers a hundred pages of readable advice.http://www.randomwalkthroughlife.blogspot.com/"
4,JEW appeases the radio and fans alike,"While ""Futures"" is no Clarity, it sure gets closer than ""Bleed American"". One of the most disappointing parts of ""Bleed American"" (which is a good album) was it's radio-friendliness. ""Futures"" continues with that for about the first half of the album. Songs such as the title track, ""Work"", and ""Kill"", are sure to be potential hits and expose the more popular side of JEW. But the best part of this album is the second half, especially the ending. ""Polaris"", ""Night Drive"", and ""23"", are some of JEW's best songs in a while, capturing the Clarity style again. The only lacking song on the album is ""The World You Love"" which is so poppy and melodic it gets annoying, possibly the worst song JEW has ever written.As a pretty hardcore fan, I would like to sometime see JEW do songs dating back to material on ""Static Prevails"". But this is a definite must buy for any JEW fan. Just know that the radio probably likes it as you do."
5,Rocking harder,"This CD isnt as upbeat as thier last album.. in fact its much more somber. BUT, that doesnt mean that they arnt good. THIS CD IS THE BEST I have EVER heard as a whole. Each song individually rated should be like 4-5 stars... its so good. MUST have for any collection"
4,"""I'm in love with the ordinary...""","Jimmy Eat World's Futures is a beautiful and layered disc. Standout tracks include: Kill, The World You Love, Drugs or Me, Polaris, Pain, and Night Drive. Could the track Night Drive be anymore perfect and gorgeous, ""Kiss me with your cherry lipstick, never wash you off my face, hit me I can take your cheap shot, leave you with the love we made."" Drugs or Me had my hooked after first listen, ""If only you could see the stranger next to me, you promised you promised that you're done but I can't tell you from the drugs."" The song Kill is so haunting and amazing, you'll love it! ""I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel I wish I'd go to you..."" Futures has to be the coolest rock album to be released in the last couple of years, you won't regret this choice of music."
3,Feels watered down from previous work,"I've been a BIG fan of Jimmy Eat World ever since hearing ""For me This is Heaven"" on their ""Clarity"" album about 5 years ago. I enjoyed ""Bleed American"" and was eagerly anticipating ""Futures"". However, I found the whole album a let down. The lyrics seemed cliche and the music supporting them seemed redundant and un-inspired. Tracks like ""Pain"" seem like they were written with a 13 year-old boy who just got grounded for swearing in mind. The tracks I did like, particulary ""23"" seemed to get old after a only a couple weeks of listening. Other tracks showed brief signs of life, then soon after became watered down in mediocricy. Still, Jimmy Eat World has always been a favorite band of mine and I may be overly critical because of my disapointment. Check out the ""Clarity"" or ""Bleed American"" albums for a true representation of their musicianship."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I was turned onto Jimmy Eat World on the day that Bleed American was released having heard the first two tracks on a demo CD. I soon bought Clarity, which easily ranks in my all time top five.Futures was kind of a disappointment for me. The songs all have a mushy ""same"" quality to them, despite the generally darker tone to the album than their prior two. There are a few notable songs, like the cooing ""Night Drive,"" but for the most part this album simply doesn't get playtime in my MP3 player.Clearly I'm in the minority in my opinion, but the wonderful thing about Amazon is that you are free to sample the music for yourself, or even download a few of the more popular tracks and the rest later if you like them.Cheers."
4,Nice,"I figured with such solid songs as Pain and Work with such succinct titles, it was only apropos that I title my review with one word that sums up the Futures CD - Nice. Honestly, it took a few listens. After a few, however, I began to read the lyrics as I was listening to it and really started to appreciate the depth of the songs as well as enjoy them.While songs such as 23 and Killer are weak in my opinion, the introspective and addictive Just Tonight..., the solid guitar work and intensity of Nothingwrong, The World You Love, and the guilty pleasure track of the album, Night Drive, more than make up for them (not to mention the obvious choices of Pain and Work). Futures (the song) is a little on the poppy side, but I enjoy its feel-good optimism nonetheless. All in all, Futures is a nice CD that, unless you're a total misanthrope, can't help but enjoy."
5,Not sure why this album gets a bad rap...,"Ive read that this album isnt as ""fun"" as bleed American. While I agree it is a little heavier and maybe a bit darker, its just as good, tho a bit less poppy. It might take a couple listens to get it, but thats how it is with all good albums. Well worth buying!"
5,On their way,"JEW has been around for quite a while, but have only fairly recently become big. They show no signs of slowing down. When all their albums have been good, it's hard to say that one is better than the other. Futures very well may be their best. Either way, they are proving to be a solid band that we can count on for good music. I bought this album the day it was release just hoping it would be as good as I hoped. It was, and I will probably buy every album they release because they have proven to be reliable."
4,Futures,"If you're a REAL Jimmy fan--hence not someone who knows them for just The Middle and Sweetness...you'll (hopefully) like this CD a lot. It can almost be compared to sounding more like Clarity, it's not as upbeat as Bleed American but it has an edgier tone to it. Some people will say they hate it cuz it's not as poppy or its too poppy...the truth is it's just good music and if you like it you like it and if you don't you don't. If you like J.E.W listen to the album a couple times and give it a chance."
1,Not worth it,"This album is way overproduced and the performance lacks emotion for the most part, especially the vocals, which is one of my favorite things about this band. It's just bad. I bought the double CD special edition, and after I listened to the first disc, which is the studio album, I almost went and returned it. Then I listened to the bonus disc, which is demos of all the songs. It was SOOOO much better. The writing is better, the production is better, and the performance has so much mor energy. I showed the difference to 3 other people and they all agreed that the demos were better. I don't know what the band members were thinking, but they should have released something more like thte demos. The studio album sounds like generic bad pop rock, whereas the demos sound like good music. So, if you are thinking about getting this album, just go for the double cd bonus one."
1,Nothing like their last CD,"I loved Jimmy Eat World's self-titled CD (with Sweetness, the Middle, etc). When I heard their new single ""Pain"", I thought it was so fantastic, I couldn't wait to hear the Futures CD. But when I finally heard it.... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Everyone else here seemed to love this CD and maybe it's good in its own way, but for fans of their last album, this one is much quieter and nowhere near as much fun. I could go to sleep with songs like ""Kill"" and ""Polaris"". I know everyone says that the guitarwork is brilliant, yadda yadda yadda, but I don't care... about 75% of this album is really boring.The decent songs on the album are ""Pain"", ""Futures"", ""Work"", ""Just Tonight"", and ""Nothing Wrong"". All the other songs are very slow, ballad-type songs. But if you like that kind of stuff, by all means go out and buy the album."
2,ugh no no no wrong.,"no way it's just a bunch of slow songs!i only like 2 songs, Pain and just tonight, those are the only fast and good ones. my friend Alex Kisor, burned it for me, and it sucked. and i was going to waste my money! don't get it."
1,Not good JEW,"This album is a disappointment. JEW has sold out. Sure, this album is okay if you like cheesy poppiness, but what further evidence do you need that the band sold out than a techno-pop ""Last Christmas""? Sadly, most of the tracks even lack a catchy melody like they did in 'Bleed American,' making me wonder exactly what this album's redeeming values are.Definitely not Emo, and not even good for pop."
5,Comfortable,"I don't know if my laptop needs to be kept cool or not, but this is a nice simple stand, regardless. Just a slight rise and angle, which makes keyboarding and reading the screen comfortable. I use one on a bed tray and the other on the kitchen table, which makes me feel more safer using my laptop in spill-friendly environments. As long as I don't dump a beverage on the keyboard, should a spill happen, the computer's just high enough to avoid a flood. Light enough for travel. On airplanes the stand keeps your laptop from sliding off the tray table."
5,Great Solution for my MacBook Aluminum Unibody,"I used to own Targus Traveler Coolpad since my iBook day. I switched to MacBook Aluminum Unibody about 3 years ago, I sticked with Coolfeet since Targus discontinued Coolpad. I just found out last week that Road Tools still carried it and I order right away. With new ""Lego"" feet design, It even better sit still and more rigid. I just left my 2 years old Coolfeet at home and replace with this Coolpad. It is cool as it name!!"
3,Not bad. . .,"Finding this book was a welcome surprise. I have enjoyed L. Ron Hubbard's early fiction writing, and I'm glad that someone has decided to publish the old stuff rather than his Scientology stuff.This story is fast-paced, but shallow. A vagrant runs into a mad scientist performing sensory-deprivation experiments. The mad scientist postulates that wha we know as fiction is reality in another dimension. Our hero finds himself in the City of Brass of Arabian Knights fame, encountering ghouls, djinn, and, of course, a lovely princess that he has to rescue. At 125 pages, you'll probably read through it in one sitting."
2,Super Star cast typical remake lack of recreation,"I bought the original 1946 version from AMAZON and loved it. The DVD included 2 versions and I enjoyed sitting through both. It has suspense, lots of bodies, killers known and unknown. The remake was set in Britain and its 1978 English adaptation of Raymond Chandler's famous ""The Big Sleep,"" was a let down. Robert Miotchem was super and held the weak movie together. The ""R"" rating was because of the two ""perky"" women showing skin which highlights their unstable character ,and beauty, but little else. The plot in both stories was complicated but the 1978 version ending was lacking in closure. I bought the 1978 version used and the Jimmy Steward title on the cover was just a bit part. I can't rate this movie over 2.5 stars and it hurts me to do so given the legendary character of the star strewn cast."
4,An exciting but confuseing book,This book is completely difrent from the other books wicth is good. but the book makes it seem like with out the Animorphs we would be infestted. The end is a bit confusing.
3,Good but very cunfusing,i though it was a great book but there was one main trouble i had no idea how jake got anywhere and the ending made no sense
5,Great light set at a great price.,"The S-V (401455) KF2U 2-LITE THRIFTY KIT is an excellent product at a very affordable price. I have used the lighting kit on several occasions, including senior pictures and prom pictures. In both of these instances the lights worked excellent. They are very easy to use and set up in minutes. They work as well as a more expensive strobe light set that I purchased earlier. For the armature and even an experienced professional, this light set is a great addition."
3,Good value,"If you have to have protein and hate the taste of protein shakes like I do, this is the best of very few alternatives. The 6 pack value is good for me to have about a 5-6 week supply of protein powder."
4,Well made and is great for the money.,I did a lot of looking around for a chain/lock and have found this set is the best bang for your buck. The quality of the Trimax THEX5060 combo set is really heavy duty and well made. I would but this over the Kryptonite chain any day.
4,good for the price,"this chain was much cheaper (in price) than the other chains I looked at. I've had it for a couple months and so far I haven't had any problems. The chain is really heavy duty and the noose makes chaining it to things much easier. The U-lock seems to be the cheapest part of the set, but so far it's done it's job."
3,Sheer nostalgia,"Why can't they write melodious music and witty lyrics like this any more? World-weary cynical critics, I guess!A modern digital recording would increase enjoyment even more.Ken Munday"
3,Pleasantly enjoyable,Light and frothy. Good voices unknown to me. Probably would not be successful in a revial tto much of it's own time.
4,STARTER GUIDE,This is a fun book to have when you are thinking of getting a HUSKY. Great way to get a idea of what you are getting into and a nice idea on how they will move your life in a great direction.. I recommend it as a first husky book then move the Siberian Huskys for dummies.
5,Excellent Service,"The service was excellent, the book arrived in a timely manner, in less than 2 weeks, and was in the condition described. Would purchase from this seller again."
2,"Good introduction to basic training, but no new information","This book would be great for anyone considering a Siberian Husky, or a new dog owner as it contains basic dog care tips and an introduction to training techniques. I was looking for a book with some special hints for training huskies (as they can be difficult dogs to train) and was disappointed. Although the title is 'How to Train You Siberian Husky' a large amount of space in the book is dedicated to caring for your dog - not training."
3,Can you train a husky?,"Train your Siberian? Most Sibe owners will laugh out loud at this. Sure, they will do simple tricks for treats, but you know they are just putting you on. Husky owners would welcome a book that addressed the unique character of the husky and described methods of using the husky mentality to teach and train. This book is very much in the genre of those dog books which are 75% generic and 25% breed specific. Much of the text is not husky specific, though that in no way makes it not useful in general. The rub in the case of the husky is that as husky owners we want to address those unique husky traits that defy our best efforts at training.This book may be found lacking for experienced husky owners, while those new to the breed will surely find this useful. You may also findBreed All About It Season 4 - Episode 22: Siberian Huskyof interest!"
3,pretty good,"my 2 year old was non stop whining and i started reading her this book, i think it helped her understand that mama doesnt like whining! worth the investment1"
1,terrible for your child,"I watched this once with my child and never watched it again. It is the worst kind of irritating kids entertainment/education dvd. The songs are sung at a garbled, much too fast pace; the upbeat mood is sugar-loaded, artificial and forced; and the adults who push it along its helium-fed course are an inane, insane clown posse. Save your money."
3,Just Okay,It is just OK and really doesn't clean as well as advertised. I had to use it several times to get the cleanliness I wanted
2,so so,bought this for my outdoor grill.Took nearly the whole bottle for one cleaning...was a bit disappointed for the price.
5,Lives up to its title,"This book is really written to be useful practically, and in that sense it is very successful. It is also written very concisely, so it is likely that it will clear many doubts. However, there are almost no theoretical explanations at all. In this sense, it is not a book that contributes to the theoretical understanding of statistics; so don't expect to know more about theory of statistics using this book; instead get ``Principles of Statistics"" by M.G.Bulmer. This is a book to keep on the desk to help do practical statistical calculations and make inferences."
3,Needed for class,"Needed this class for a quantitative class - because the book is old, the examples & methods (& humor) are a bit outdated, but main methods of statistics are under there somewhere."
4,"Great Detergent, Lousy Container","I really enjoy this detergent, as it works well on all types of laundry. My main gripe is with the container itself. It doesn't pour right, which results in a lot of excess detergent spilled all over the bottle. Despite this, my laundry always comes out smelling clean and Method's commitment to making environmentally-friendly products at reasonable costs is great for the consumer."
1,Method changed this formula and it smells terrible!,"While previously happy with this product, it seems Method has changed the formula for this detergent (Method confirmed this)and the result is TERRIBLE! It smells like dirty paint!! The picture for this item needs to be changed to reflect then new green bottle which contains the new terrible-smelling formula for the free & clear detergent."
4,Can't find it locally,"I am pleased that Amazon offers Method detergent and other Method products as my local stores have stopped carrying them. My family has been using Method laundry products for a few years now and we like the fact that we're not releasing harmful chemicals into the water supply every time we wash our clothes. The Free & Clear is exactly what the bottle says: there are no strong perfumes, dyes, or other irritants."
3,Less expensive at Target...,"I love Method products! But I miss-read the case pack - thought it was a pack of 6 - but it really is a pack of 4 - in the end, even with free shipping I paid $2 more per bottle then I do at Target."
4,Easy to Use,"I purchased this book because I needed to see Spanish verbs written in all of their tenses and persons. I had been using ""verbal-only"" instructions and wasn't sure I was making correct inferences about what I was hearing. Or saying! I'm satisfied with what this book provides."
2,Big mistake !!!,"It is not a fabric, it seems to be some sort of low quality micro suede...Do not like it at all. Very cheap one .... This purchase was a mistake ... Very poor description, seller must describe the item correctly declare and explain what is it made from, fabric, natural or synthetic material. Not comfortable, and looks very cheap...."
5,Nice Skirt,"This is a nice skirt. It can be dressed up or down. It is very comfy . The price was great, and the company always delivers on time."
2,Love the style NOT the fabric,"I haven't worn the (black)skirt yet and it's been a month. It could be great for a costume piece (witch). I doubt that I will wear it given the fabric is suede and it doesn't exactly fit the style of the skirt. In my opinion, Suede isn't suitable for a ruffled skirt. I decided not to send it back given that I paid like $12 for it."
3,"Pretty skirt, but not what I was expecting","I thought the fabric on this skirt was going to be a little more lightweight, with more flow. It actually feels almost like suede. It's a very full,heavy fabric.Other than that, it's very well made,lined, and great for fall/winter, paired up with some nice boots. I'll make it work!"
2,not for me,"I dont really care for the fabric, it seems to be some sort of micro suede...and its larger that the normal size,, its too big for me."
1,Dissappointment,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 yr old son. He was excited about them when he opened it and immediately started knocking the ball around inside the house. Within 20 minutes of normal play the leather on the club had ripped. I was prepared to just fix it with a patch of some kind. However within an hour the club was broken in two. It was a break that could not be repaired. My son was heartbroken that he broke his brand new Christmas present. I boxed up the set and returned it to the place I purchased it and I am still awaiting a refund. Though, I think this is a fun item for kids, it is not durable at all."
2,"Pretty set to look at, hard to use.","My son is 19 months old. He had a ""cheap"" set of clubs that he could swing well and he connected with the ball every time, like a little pro. But this ""cheap"" set fell apart so we thought we would get a better, more expensive set because he plays golf practically all day. We got this set and have quickly discovered that he has a difficult time using the set. The clubs are too heavy and the rubber on the ends of them skid against the floor making it difficult for him to swing properly to connect with the ball. Not the best set. Pretty, but not functional. Now we are going to have to spend more money to buy a new set so he can continue to improve his game."
3,Puzzled...,"If you have to purchase it for your class - sure, go for it, however, I would never recommend it a bedside reading for people interested in microeconomics - the content is very dry and puzzling at times..."
4,microeconomics,The product arrived at the expected day and in great condition. I am pleased with the purchase.
1,"Not ""New""","The seller indicated that this book was ""new"" but when I received it the book was clearly used. The cover is in good condition but someone has highlighted passages on the inside. I paid $70 for what I was told was a new book while many of my classmates paid $5 for the same used book."
3,Book Review,"I found this book to have clarity in the major topics of microeconomics which could help you to understand the basics. However this should only be used as basis reading and other books should be used to cover the various topics in more depth, such as Koutsoyanis and others which give more insight on specific topics. All in all it is a good solid core text book which can give you the basic knowledge needed in microeconomics."
4,"Very clear, even if you never had economics.","Although long, the book has very good quality material. Exercises are appropriate and cover all material.The only thing that should be improved is the index for easier research. Index was incomplete and every time I need to search something specific, I had to go trhough the chapters to find it."
4,Microeconomics Study Guide,"Smooth process of ordering and receiving the book. No problems.As far as the material in the book is concerned, it is a great overview of key concepts at a basic level. One drawback is the lack of practice problems on transfer pricing."
2,Does not live up to what it claims,"The book basically gives a good overview about the most important elements of microeconomic theory and is easily understandable for the beginner in this field. However, the author's consistent emphasis on economics being a proper ""science"" leaves some shale after-taste due to lack of mthematical and logical rigor throughout the book. This is finally underlined when one attempts to work on some exercises - scare, careless sample solutions with very low information content are not suitable to give any benefit to the student. Did some low paid staff provide the solutions ? Did anybody review them at all ? ulrich lautenschlaeger"
3,"Its clearly written, however laughable as an inter. Text","The book is clearly written, however, I found that it is to simple and somewhat weak as a intermediate level text. I agree with most of the other comments that it would be more suitable as an entry level Economics text. This book would probably be better suited for students who are buisness or non-economics majors taking the intermediate course."
2,A Beginner's Text...,"Although billed as a text ""suitable for students with a broad range of backgrounds,"" as an intermediate student using it this semester in a graduate public policy program core class, I've found this book of little value. Topics are rarely covered in depth (e.g., utility effects of taxation and subsidies are consigned to roughly two pages), examples, though clearly explained, are rather basic -- mathematical formulas are scarce and calculus is nonexistent -- and the graphs are less descriptive relative to other intermediate texts. (If you've used either of Nicholson's texts, this one is certain to disappoint in comparison.) In short, beginners may benefit; others should not waste their money."
3,Pindyck's textbook needs more solved problems,"This text uses clearly-written definitions and lots of colorful charts. However, it is missing a crucial element for learning the subject of microeconomics: lots of problems worked out in a clear and systematic manner. I had to buy a Schaum's guide to make up for this deficiency."
1,Not worth the price unless it is free,This is nothing more than a very small piece of cotton cloth that is over-priced. The size and usefulness is such that I would only expect to see these as give-aways at a trade show or something. What a joke - there are much better values to be found on Amazon such as the Nikon Micro Fiber cleaning cloth that fits into its' own pouch. I wish I had found it before I purchased this piece of worthless scrap.
5,Great Southern Rock lives again,"Call it rock-a-billy, southern rock or country rock, it is alive and well. This cd is well worth the wait and the price. It fits well in te tradition of the Van Zant family."
1,Kudos to Amazon,Amazon rocks. They pulled they infected CD's from sale and allowed these reviews that tell of the problems. Shame on Sony they not only messed with the consumers but also the artists. This is sadly just another chapter in a long litany of similar arrogant acts by Sony. The good news is they are not making any profit as they are operating in the RED. Unlike Amazon the biggest bricks and mortar retailers are still selling the DRM Rootkit CDs even after Sony caved to pressure and recalled them last week. The sony bmg website has a webform to get a free UPS shipping label and they will not only send you a new rootkit free CD they will also email you details of a free MP3 download after they recieve your CD. Because in addition to the rootkit virus problem this was also a lame attempt to defeat copying to an ipod but the free MP3's will work on an ipod.
1,BEWARE - COPY PROTECTION CONTAINS TROJAN THAT COULD CRIPPLE YOUR COMPUTER,"From CNET.COM:""the software uses a sophisticated cloaking technique that involves a ""rootkit""--something not dangerous in itself, but a tool often used by virus writers to hide all traces of their work on a computer.""""In the case of the SonyBMG software, trying to remove the software manually could shut off access to the computer's CD player [permanantly], researchers said.""BEWARE!!!!!!!Futher info: www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/01/sony_rootkit_drm/"
5,Excellent Collection of Workouts from Men's Health Magazine,"This book delivers what it promises: A Collection of total Body Workouts.The fact that every workout is in Poster format is great and practical, you just select the workout you want to try, take the specific poster out with you, and you are done to begin training. I really love the functionality of having the whole workout in just one page.Its a fantastic idea for a training book, well executed, and with the total body workouts included I believe its a great deal."
4,Luther Allison is one of my favorites,"Although he has been gone for a long time, I enjoy many of his songs. This cd has two of the songs that I really enjoy."
1,"NOT ""Pk of 4""","I was quite upset when I recieved this product because in the name and description of this product, is says ""Pk of 4"". I assumed that means that I would get 4 totes with my order. I DID NOT. I only received one (1)."
5,Knock Sensor,"The time had came to change my knock sensor for my 2003 subaru WRX and decided to go with this, and it was straight plug in, install took about 30 mins and I was very happy. Nice product and excellent price"
3,Only Amusing,"This collection of dumb laws does provide entertainment. Each page is one dumb law, followed by an explanation of it, and the majority of them are funny. However, there are only 101 laws in this book, and in total it takes about 10 minutes to read. Also, it isn't funny enough to the point where you can keep rereading it.The question, then, is whether the book is worth buying. Unless you plan on putting it on your coffee table for party amusement, it really doesn't provide the amount of humor you pay for."
1,Disappointing,"The authors have found a couple of really dumb laws, but most of the book features unusual scenarios that the authors create that are technically illegal. The title is an example of this. The law actually states that the fire hydrant should not be blocked by anything- so yes, it would be illegal to tie the alligator to the fire hydrant. But is that really a dumb law? Each page features one law and the authors comments. Not much substance to this book."
3,"dumb, dumber laws","This book is hilarious! Even funnier is that dumb laws still exist, and in the USA of all places. Talk about ""rational ignorance""! And it took high-schoolers to bring the dumbness of it all to attention. The book illustrations are great. This is not superior non-fiction, for sure. It is enjoyable, and I loved, nonetheless. You will too, I bet.Amavilah, Author[...]National Wealth Accounting and Baseball Player Exports: Economic Implications for PerformanceISBN: 978-3838330099Economic Versus Non-Economic Dimensions of the Well-being of Nations.ISBN: 9783838320984Modeling Determinants of Income in Embedded Economies.ISBN: 1600210465Quotable Arthur Schopenhauer.ISBN: 9781430324959"
3,Great Numbers Book -- But Not for Baby or Early Pre-Schooler,"This is a wonderfully inventive book about numbers for children -- but you'll be disappointed if you buy it as your child's FIRST numbers book.The book consists of number exercises that are just too sophisticated for a typical pre-schooler. My three-year-old loves the book but is interested in the colorful illustrations and the idea of numbers, not the actual questions that the book poses. He just isn't ready for its brain teasers that require the child to scrutinize the page for clues to the answers!Your child may find the book charming because it features the same adorable rabbits in Alan Baker's series, but don't expect too much interaction early on."
5,Kidsongs _ A Day at the Circus,"My children loved this video when they were younger, I loved being able to get it again for my grandchildren, who also loved it."
3,pretty good,If you like Jim Brewer comedy then you cant go wrong with this one... my wife and I both laughed pretty good at this one and I can watch it more than one & still laugh.
3,Not as good as I expected,"It seems Jim spent too much time talking about himself rather than things in life he finds funny. I enjoyed the show, but it's not 5-star worthy. I didn't buy this to get the behind-the-scene on goat-boy, or hear about his history with SNL, or how he got the part for the movie Half Baked; I wanted funny material about things in life we can all relate to. This was nothing more than a story about his life, and as much as I like Jim, I really didn't buy it for that."
5,Funny!,This special is hilarious without the typical dirty jokes that stand-up comedians love to use.
5,The new high-water mark in dad comedy,"I saw the bit where Jim's daughters get him out of bed at the crack of dawn to play kitty about a year ago, and since then have been waiting for this vid to be available. I swear it's one of the funnier riffs about being a dad I have ever seen, and it's so true. I had to pause the show several times so I could stop laughing enough to hear the rest. My whole family loved it. And who'd have thought that Breuer could do such a wicked kangaroo impression?"
1,Beware: This Phone Cannot Store Large Numbers.,"While the price is hard to beat, this phone becomes dysfunctional should you try to store numbers longer than 10 digits. Yes, ATT will tell you that storing large numbers is possible. Here's what they dont tell you:'the Directory ""hangs"" on every, single entry in your phonebook that includes a calling card number, 10-10 dial around number, etc. This means that if you had 10 numbers stored in this phone, it could take as much as 10 minutes to reach the final number, because the program ""hangs"" for at least 45 secs on each number as you try to toggle through the list.This made the phone basically useless for us, as we do alot of international calling, with a dial-around prefix."
1,3 month and failed,"after minimum use touchpad failed...i use back of a pencil to dial thus putting 5 pounds of pressure to dial keys 3, 6, 9"
1,Buyer Beware: Not All Features Work,"Handset and touch tone dialing work well. Speakerphone does not function consistently, Caller ID name removal is tedious and repetitive. ATT Customer Service website and 800 number do not provide support nor answers to questions. Phone manual is very limited and does not provide thorough troubleshooting answers."
4,Good phone for a reasonable price,This phone has met all my expectations for a basic speakerphone with Call Display. Purchased from Amazon several years ago and have never had problems with it.
4,Loaded With Useful Features,"I have used this phone for a year with no technical problems. Sound quality is OK. LCD display has good contrast, which is also adjustable. Good features besides those mentioned in other reviews are a line status light to let you know if the phone line is available without picking up the receiver, and a ""Directory"" function that can capture caller ID names and numbers and display them sequentially in alphabetical order for later retrieval and automatic dialing. Lots of functionality for the money."
5,Delivered.,"TV delivery went smoothly. Six days after the order, the delivery company called to set up the delivery time. The delivery guys arrived on time, carried the 150 lb. TV up two flights of stairs, unboxed it, carefully set it down on my stand, then took the packing with them. Kudos to Amazon and Eagle Delivery. Great job.The TV has exceeded my expections. Great Picture! Easy set-up and ajustments. I did read the manual two days after I wired it up to the home theater, dvd and vcr, and had played with all the settings, but needn't have bothered. The good speakers and sound was unexpected. I only use the home theater sound for DVD viewing."
2,"So Far, Disappointing","After reading other purchaser's comments about the picture, I had somewhat high hopes, I suppose, but for ""$..."", I'd expect to get a picture without so much noise and distortion. The problem consists of a quite noticible line pattern. Perhaps this is a problem with all larger screen TV's, but this picture really compares poorly to my 6 year old JVC 27 inch set. I just received the set and may return it if I can't improve the picture quality."
3,3 Years Old and Wearing Out,Even though this model is no longer available I thought I'd write a review since mine is now on the verge of dying. Bought it in November 2001. Great TV until about summer 2004 when picture started getting a noticeable green tint to it. Around Nov. 2004 the TV started turning itself off at random moments. It used to happen about once every couple of days but it now will only stay on for 5 minutes before shutting off. Paid $850 for this TV and it isn't even 4 years old. I've always been impressed with Toshiba quality in the past but now I don't know if I want to take another chance with one of their TV's. If you're looking into buying a Toshiba you might want to think twice.
5,Very Happy with my decision,"I spent a long time in stores just staring at the various 32"" TVs. I decided that I wanted a flat screen, and it seemed the choice was between Sony and Toshiba. I went with Toshiba because I just liked it a little better, and there are alot of bad things said about the Vegas (good things too). I am delighted with my choice. DVDs look AMAZING! My PS2 looks fantastic on it as well. I highly recommend this set."
1,another one bites the dust,bought a toshiba that died 1 year still under warranty... decided to try antoher bought this model and it too has died less than 3 years after purchase... Spent about $850 on TV. Would highly not recommend!!
3,Amethyst Sparkler,"The stones in this bracelet are much lighter than in the picture. I would describe them as pale amethyst. The faceting, which I believe is called checkerboard, really catches the light. 7 1/4"" in length, 5mm wide."
3,Not as nice as I expected...,"I think this is a great knife, but there is a little play between the blade and handle. I own several of the smaller Twitch knives, and when they're open, they have a rock solid feel. On this knife, the blade is a little sloppy. You can make it tighter by adjusting the screw, but then the blade doesn't spring open properly. Still a great knife."
2,That Funky song you're looking for isn't on this CD,"If you're like me, you pulled up this CD hoping to find the funky instrumental that provided the background for one of the game scenes. That song (for some unknown reason) isn't on this CD. The song you're looking for is called ""Super Bad"" or ""Call Me Super Bad"". It's from the Godfather of Soul, James Brown. You can pick up the original version on his greatest hits CD available from Amazon. I've been unable to locate the 100% instrumental version. I suppose it's possible that version was cut and mixed exclusively for the movie.By the way, if you like that kind of funky music, but you have a hard time finding sources - I suggest you pull up a group called Galactic. These guys are from New Orleans and they're fairly current..I really like their ""Coolin Off"" CD...great production values and musicianship."
3,HELP NEEDED!!,"Love the film, love the soundtrack. Only problem i have is trying to locate an album by the 'Venice Beach Boys'!! I love the 2 tracks you hear at the start of the film, and know they're album will be the nuts!! any help would be appreciated!"
3,Good pump up tunes,This cd is good for those who like to listen to music to get themselves going. It is a quality cd for getting the blood pumping.
3,how can I get the Gloria song??,"ya this was a sick movie but I was wonderin where I could get the song ""Gloria"" thats in the movie...don't know why but I was feelin it and can't find it anywhere...same with the accapella with the older guys outside the court..."
3,bogus shipping costs,Bogus false advertising. The shipping is listed as almost the same as the price of the stand?
2,bad bag,"Just didn't hold up under regular use. The drawstring ripped after 3 uses. The interior coating pealed off about the same time, leaving little blue pieces of coating on everything. After a week of use I threw it away as it was in pieces."
1,Very cheaply made,"I bought this bag for my Scuba class and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a bag. I should have spent a little more to get something that would actually hold up. The first time I took this bag to class the front area that connects the drawstring to the mesh ripped, this wasn't that bad and I didn't mind. What really got me was when the strap ripped after the third or fourth time using the bag. The stitching ripped away like nothing and now I'm forces to carry it by the drawstring or under my arm. I was very disappointed by this product. Spend a little more money and get something else!"
5,Solid Book but a supplement not subsitute,"This is the best book on boxing I've encountered. The author does a good job of explaining technique and providing drills for exercise. However, ANY book on boxing will be inadequate for learning how to box. Good boxing skills can't be learned from a book - just the way you can't learn to dance well from a book. To physically know how to box you need a trainer and you need to get in the ring and spar. To master the techniques, it must feel right. You acquire that feeling by watching your trainer and having him/her correct your mistakes. You have to be physically next to that person (Anyone who's learned to box or dance will tell you this is true). You polish those techniques and gain confidence in using them through sparing. Yet the author does deserve credit for putting out a fine book."
2,Dishonest Seller,"I am keeping the product but would never purchase from Polkadoprincess72 again. I was assured that the book had ""never been read so the pages are intact and tight."" The book arrived and was most obviously used and worn."
5,Killer artist. Killer CD,"I bought this cd as a recommendation from a friend. I'll admit that I was a little worried about paying an import price for an artist I'd never heard of. But in all honesty, this cd is really good. The music and lyrics are so fresh, I didn't expect that from someone as young as I am. I would recommended this cd to anyone who likes boyzone. You won't regret buying this one."
4,Very Nice!,"I like this CD. I usually buy a CD for one song, but on this one, I like the majority of the songs. Stephen Gately has such a beautiful voice. You can't help but feel good when you listen to his music."
3,Bicycle tires.,These tires were what I ordered but I ordered the wrong size. Be sure you know what size you need before you order tires because it cost more than half what I paid to ship these back. I just decided to keep them and try to resale them.
4,Sophomore Slump,"Not quite as giddily brilliant as Season 1. The ingenues are vapid, and the ""villain"" one dimensional. And although the writing is as sharp as before, McKinney, Coyne and Martin have bitten off more than they can chew, juggling way too many plotlines. Subsequently, some of them are wrapped up in hasty, unconvincing ways. Personally, I would have preferred some juicy cliffhangers going into Season 3. But there are some delicious bits here, primarily Ellen's tax audit (which culminates in a wild, hysterical twist) and a deeply moving one involving an understudy and his crumbling marriage. Any way you slice it, this is superior television, with some of the most inspired comic performances and moments you're likely to find anywhere. As intelligent entertainment, ""Slings & Arrows"" could not be bettered."
5,Just as expected,"Item was used, and arrived in perfect condition, just as described. My little ones love singing along to all the songs."

4,A luxurious read,"The basic premise of this book is that the essence of style, in all things fashionable, culinary, and otherwise, was set in France with Louis XIV. Some things he invented outright, while others he merely popularized; either way, these qualities became (and continue to be) national characteristics of the French as a whole. Each chapter covers a different luxury and provides its history. Some choices are obvious, such as haute couture, but others, like umbrellas, are surprising. While highly readable and un-academic, the author used primary sources to get her information, and her argument works. This book is recommended, especially if you have already succumbed to Francophilia."
5,Great book,Bought this in both hardcover [my copy] and paperbook [to loan]. This is an excellent source book that I highly recommend.
5,Fascinating,"I found this book very enjoyable, well-organized and researched. I liked the way that history was made so accessible and related to modern day. Although I read the book some months ago, I think of its content often."
3,In desperate need of a good editor,"This reads like separate articles -- maybe lectures? -- thrown together to make a book. A good editor would have smoothed out the bumps. And it needs many more illustrations. That said... it's fun to read, well researched, and fascinating as we're led to consider how much from the time of Louis XIV still influences how the wealthy spend their money today!"
3,ok,Purchased through Amazon. It's difficult to say more than this is a common acrylic box and was delivered intact and on time. You can't ask for more than that.
3,it's ok,"it's a nice little box, but it is veerryy brittle. picked up the lid and a piece chipped off, later dropped it and another piece chipped off, and then picked it up again another time and had another piece chip off"
2,Typical product today,Arrive with all 4 courners of lid cracked-this was not from a damaged package-it came that way. . . .
3,A nice turn-around after some really disappointing albums,"This is a much more pleasant group of songs than some of Byrne's more recent offerings, which have gotten pretty dismal. Some songs are reminiscent of the joyful silliness of ""Uh-Oh"", although there's still a lot of the churning cellos of the dreary ""David Byrne"". There are some wonderful string arrangements, but too little of the complex percussion that used to be Byrne's hallmark. It does grow on you."
4,"It's kinda like love, but a better emotion","This album is wonderous. It gets a little tiresome at points, but the high points reach very, very high. U.B. Jesus is an absolutely phenominal song. Go and buy."
2,I heard this was his best work since Talking Heads...,"If so, then I'm glad I didn't bother with any of the other albums. I know it's not fair to compare his solo career to that band. I would have the same complaints had I just heard Frank Black for the first time since the Pixies. But... if you are looking for a more Talking Heads style album, don't look here. Fairly interesting album art concept, though. However, Mr. Byrne is quite the performer and I'm sure these songs would be more appreciated if heard in concert."
2,"Good music, horrible singing","I was impressed with the music arrangement but the singing absolutely killed the experience. The singing is worse when he performs live. I caught a performance on the Late Show. The string arrangement was beautiful, the incorporation of drums was perfect, but when David started singing ""The Great Intoxication"" I couldn't help but say: UGH!"
4,the return of Rei Mo Mo ?,"I like this CD but, it reminds me of ""Rei Mo Mo"" which is my least favorite ""Byrne CD"". I was hopingfor a sequal to ""Uh Oh"" or ""Feelings"".I do enjoy ""Rei Mo Mo"" and ""Look Into The Eyeball"".They're just not my Fav's.(check out Tom Ze')"
5,Best Album of 2001,"WOW - David Byrne is so brilliant! ""Look Into the Eyeball"" is definitely my favorite so far ... this album is excellent from start to finish. It is diverse, melodic, dance-able, and fun to sing along with! It only took one listen - and I was hooked! This is a must have album for Byrne fans! (And while you are at it, check out his live show ... SUPERB!)"
1,Oh my god...,"WTF.This guy should be shot or at least locked away forever for attempting to make money off of this travesty. And someone should beat some sense into letterman, too.Then I read that he was the frontman of Talking Heads; that explains alot.There isn't one redeeming quality to this drivel. Lyrics, music, voice are all pretty sorry.If you listen to this you'd be better off converting to (c)rap."
5,David Byrnes Delivers!,Again in his genius method of turning everyday lifes doldrums into amazing pieces of art. David Byrne once again shows us the rythms that course through lifes simple moments. A great album for people that enjoy the obtuse.
1,Just a bad movie,"How bad? Very. Poor acting. Terrible cinematography. Horrific sets. All of that would have been okay had they stuck to the story of Homer, which is what I was expecting, but they even changed that. Terrible. Boring, slow, worthless."
4,"As good as a tv movie can get, read the books","As a tv movie Helen of Troy was above the average. It was good for what they could have done. This movie was not as deep in mythology but was created to bring out the way man behaves for, during and after war.This was not based on Homer's version of the Trojan war rather a mixture of other versions. There is barely any supernatural forces involved compared to most mythology stories of Trojan war. If you read Edith Hamilton's ""Mythology"" that version and the movie are almost identical in the story except for the fact the greek gods are not involved with the exception of Aphrodite.As a tv movie, i give it a 4. To Homer's master piece i give it a one, i suggest anyone to read the book."
1,prior reviews lack perception,"I am sick and tired of these two-bit movie watchers that know nothing about good acting pretending to review a performance. In the process of reviewing this 3rd rate movie some people have seemed inclined to put down the theatrical release of ""Troy"". Wrong ! To the point: Brad Pitt. I have watched him give silly and idiotic performances and I have watched him give great performances the result of great focus. Troy is a great performance - period !!!. The problem that occurs is that just because people consider him good-looking they automatically feel that he can't act. To be honest, this time around Pitt looks much older than usual. The point is that once you get past the looks factor you have a deep, well-focused performance. Period !"
3,Helen of Troy,"On part one of the movie, half the story was missing. I already have this movie, but its getting worn, so I wanted another. I know how the story goes, so I know that important elements of part one are missing."
2,Too long and rather boring...,"I remember starting to watch this mini-series on TV and feeling quite bored with it. While the actors are attractive, I found Helen wanting and the screenwriting terrible.The movie TROY with Diane Krueger and Brad Pitt is infinitely better, on many levels, even though they condensed the story a lot. (the Trojan war supposedly lasted 10yrs, hence the 1,000 ships)I say ""skip this version"". >>Buy TROY instead.<<"
4,Much better than the Brad Pitt TROY movie,"I just finished watching TROY (with Brad Pitt)and I was greatly disappointed. At least Helen of Troy sticks to the story - for the most part. In the movie TROY, Menelaus is killed by Hector and Achilles & Agamemnon both die inside Troy during the sacking. In Helen of Troy there aren't any huge mistakes - at least not on the scale of TROY. Why oh why can't the directors just stick to the story?????"
1,A complete abomination,"I'm not going to waste time specifying the reasons why all extant copies of this movie should be thrown into a gigantic crater and covered over with cement. Suffice it to say that ""Helen of Troy"" is garbage. In the casting, the special effects, the acting, the script, the lack of dramatic tension, the perversion of the original story, this movie was in every imaginable way a failure. Do not- I repeat- do NOT expend your money or precious moments watching this movie. Read the Iliad- the definitive Trojan War movie has not yet been made."
3,Helen of Troy,"Helen of Troy was amazing for a TV movie. The notion that the winners write history was challenged in this movie, which almost directly portrayed the victorious Greeks as bloodthirsty waraholics. The character of Agamemnon was unforgivingly brutal, and excellently portrayed by Rufus Sewell. My favorite character was Menelaus. Lots of people say he was wimpy, but he was actually the coolest person in the movie (But that's just my opinion and the opinion of every straight girl I know). Just because Menelaus didn't go around raping helpless women and continuously jabbing swords though people's guts doesn't make him wimpy. It makes him a peacemaker. The Trojan horse was badass, as well. It was pretty unbelievable for a tv movie."
2,interesting but disapointing,a fairly humdrum affairinteresting in that the usual hero roles were not as cut and dried as we are used tobut in the end i did not believe that the lovers would risk everything as the attraction between them seemed non existant mainly due to the fact that Helen was more wooden than the Trojan horse.still the battle scenes were very well handled and the fall of troy was quite moving
1,What....!!!!????,"uugghhhh!!! This movie pissed me off so badly. Accurate my a--!!!! How are you telling the story of Helen of Troy or Troy for that matter and leavig out the Gods. What the hell was with that poisned arrow seen, perfect time for male bonding. That's completely changing Homer's work. This was a dissappointment.A couple years ago they made ""The Odyssey"" into a made-for-TV-movie, and they were on point. So, this movie could have done the same.I spent a month reading ""The Iliad"" in it's original form, then I turn on the TV and see this crap. They totally butchered Homer's work.I have to disagree with most people here, Troy was a lot more accurate than this movie. This movie was a disgrace."
4,Helen of Troy-The DvD,"Cast is Wonderful. Sienna Guillory is great as Helen. Matthew Marsden is well cast as Paris. Rufus Sewell as Agamemnon. Stellan Skarsguard reminds me of Leiam Neisen. John Rhys Davies as King Priam(not a dwarf) if you've seen Lord of The Rings you know who I'm talking about, fine actor. The only one who was miscast was Achellies, but you would have to read The Illiad to know that. It would also give you a better handle on the difference between movie and story. Several editions are available here. If you are offended by any sort of nudity, this may not be movie for you, but this is greek myth, and the only full length shot is Helen from back. If you love greek myth this is for you. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars it's short on extras."
5,Greek storytelling at its BEST on TV,"Is a grand scale movie that could easily been made for the big screen, but as a made for TV mini-series it really exells in every way of production values.From the adaptation of the story to the props. The cast is made of terrific actors from many countries, even if they're not celebrities, they're far more talented than those who have made it big in Hollywood.The sex and violence are there but they're NOT extremely graphic, and everything was tastefully done.Is a visual feast and the directors and producers really went out of their way to visualy bring this old world back to us in every aspect you see from the sets, costumes, props, etc.All lovers of the ancient Greek tales and mythology should own a copy or at least watch it."
1,Homer would be turning in his grave,"Aside from the names, i dont think the movie had anything to do with the actual story. Thyeus as far as I know died way before the Troyan war. Plus, he was killed by king Lycomides of Skyros, not Polideukis. Ifigenia was not a little girl when her father sacrificed her, and she did not die. The Goddess Artemis took her in a cloud and left a deer in her place. Achileas was no where near the other kings when Helen was given to Menelaus. And that is simply because at the time his mother Thetis had given him to king Lycomides to hide ever since he was a little boy. There are so many other things... All I have to say is that i switched it off way before the Greeks hit Troy... Whoever is looking for Homers epic story ""Iliad"" should NOT watch this movie."
5,Great Deal!,Im glad.it was just was i been wishing for since a long time!!! the delivery was great and everthg cool! thanks
1,This Trash Departs From Homer to Depict Graphic Rape.,"Boring, sadistic, exploitative version of story, altered to include graphic nudity and graphic rape of Helen. Disgusting!"
1,"How do you say ""Horrible"" in Greek?","This movie was horrible! Why did they choose such an inexperienced actress to play Helen? She wasn't that beautiful and I just couldn't see anyone making a big fuss over her. Also, her acting wasn't that great. I just didn't get into this overly long movie, which probably didn't do justice to this great story. Was a complete waste of time. If I could give it a zero, I would have."
4,Better than TROY !,"This movie, although its less glamorous than the new Troy with Brad Pitt, is closer to the truth story. Menelaus and Agamemnon don't die in Troy just because they are the bad guys!!! Hello!!! Who wrote the script to the movie called TROY anyway? He was having a bad trip, I can tell you that! The only negative point in HELEN OF TROY is the almost bad acting and Achiles was bald??? C'mon give me a break! Better shoot some nice horror b-movies guys! You should better read the real thing!"
2,very disappointed,"i am a big fan of greek myth and was very VERY excited to learn that there was a mini series on helen of troy. but, sadly, i was extremely disappointed. the person who played helen was somewhat of a good actress but wasn't convincing to be the person who 'launched a thousand ships' (and her dress seemed to be falling off at some parts of the film). and the visuals were TERRIBLE. It was annoying to watch a few hundred FAKE ships sailing the seas. cassandra was annoying as well. the story wasn't really that great either. the guy played agamemnon fit the role and john rhy-davies played a good King Priam (it was nice to see him as someone rather that Gimli from LOTR).Overall - C-Acting - BSpecial Affects - CStory - B-Costumes - BI sincerely hope the new 'Troy' movie will be better."
1,Helen of Troy,"TV movie bowdlerized version of a classic tale. Although this story has held up for centuries - this version falls flat. However, Rufus Sewell as King Agemmenon is brilliant and deserves an Emmy Award. Rufus Sewell is the ONLY really strong performance in this film - the rest of the film moves at a snails pace and is BORING. Serena Guillory as Helen of Troy could not act her way out of a paper bag - she comes across as a petulant spoiled brat - definitely not a maiden who could launch a thousand ships. I watched it for FREE on cable and still felt ""I want my money back"" - but the magnificent Rufus Sewell has many shining, illuminating moments and makes it worth watching if you fast forward to his scenes and skip over the rest of the wooden performances. This is a vanilla flavored ""lite"" version of the classic tale."
5,Tilda is marvelous!,I love the smell of Tilda Basmati rice and use my rice cooker to make it. Instead of water I use a can of chicken broth and instead of oil I use a tab of butter! It goes with any meal! I'm making myself hungry now with thoughts of chile over rice! I have had many other brands of rice but this one is marvelous!
4,This book is a must read for career driven women.,There are few women with the insight to write such a profound book. We are a complex species and Ms. Thayer does a wonderful job of not only portraying our wide range of emotions but evoking them from ourselves. This is indeed a rare gift. I picked this book up as a light summer read not expecting to be inspired to do my own soul searching such that the main character Joanna does. Congratulations are in order for Ms. Thayer and for the women who read this book and discover the meaning with in it.
2,Disappointing,"I read. ALOT. But, I have not read any of Nancy Thayer's books. I did not care for the main character much, mainly because she seems to have a thing for married men, and not much of a conscience where that was concerned.However, I will not give up on this author, but try another of her books."
5,All I know...,"...is my good friend knows a guy who owns a health food store and this is the stuff he takes. I was convinced, and then I tried it and it's amazing. I've been taking it for a while now and with my (average American) diet, I gotta get some natural energy supplement. I laugh at what our ""Monster Bull"" society spends on their silly and worthless energy drinks. It makes so much sense when you realize how worthless tablets are. Convenient ""squeeze-a-shot"" technology makes it easy to take a shot after breakfast and chase it with water or juice to equally distribute throughout your body or mix it! Tastes fine.I honestly want to say Thank you to Liquid Health for this product!"
2,MC Profile lacks Skills,"This work celebrates the catalogue of the Sound providers over a three-year period. After this time three became two, as the MC left to pursue a solo career. Not wishing to be unkind, but maybe that was the best thing to happen to this group. Production wise, they are innovative, with great use of jazzy piano samples and such. They are let down by the MC, who is pedestrian at best. With a half decent MC, the Sound providers are more than capable of progressing to the next Level."
3,Not the best... but good enough,"Still believe Think of One has better albums, like Marrakesh Emballage Ensemble 3 or Camp Shaabi. Honestly, the other good ones are really difficult to find because of the limited copies that came out originally into the market. Too bad really since the band is one of the most fruitful and original when it comes to their music. In sum, this album is for collectors only."
4,A good Survival book!,"This story is about Rebecca Whittier, the daughter of the captain of the Vigilance-a whaling boat hunting for whales in 1844. Rebecca wishes she was back home in New Bedford, with her friend and cousin. John Lowe is a free African American about Rebecca's age. John was indentured by his father to work on the Vigilance, but John hates the work. When a sudden hurricane hits the Vigilance and the lifeboats leave without them, Rebecca and John must help each other to survive the violent winds and waves. I think the other Survival books were better than this one. They spent too much time describing the whaling process and not enough time during the hurricane. It was still a better-than-average book, though."
1,poor book,"This was the most boring book I have ever read. The author spent way too much time on details and not enought on interesting stuff! My son had to use this book for a book report where he had to pick out 10 important details and find objects to help describe them. This was the most difficult task ever. All we could come up with was a cat, a harpoon, a whale a boat and oil!Horrible."
2,Ivanhoe Without Rebecca,"Scott's ""Ivanhoe"" is one of my favorite stories. I have seen every movie version, and I was curious about this one, so, I bought it. This is one of the oddest. It has been dubbed -- badly -- from what appears to be Russian. It is short. To make it short, the story has been gutted. Gone are Rebecca and her father Isaac of York. Since the story centers around Rebecca, and the love of Ivanhoe and Brian de Bois Gilbert (whose name has been altered, for no apparent reason, to ""Brian de Buge Gilbert"") for Rebecca, it really isn't ""Ivanhoe"". Also, Gilbert lives in the end. Go figure.I write this review, because I read the other reviews before buying this DVD, and I wonder whether the reviewers watched the same movie that I bought."
2,Not a good movie,"I have no idea where this movie was filmed or what language the actors (all with English names!!) were speaking, but the overdubbing was absolutely atrocious. The voice-over actors hardly made an effort to sound enthusiastic, and the voices were terrible. (Would've been better with subtitles.) The movie also could have been trimmed by about a half hour of meaningless and repetitive scenes of shooting a message arrow, trotting through the hills, etc. And them maybe they could've included two of the more critical character's from Scott's novel: Rebecca and her father. Odd that these characters were dropped.)Overall, I thought this a terrible movie, and I am usually very forgiving of anything with swords or knights."
5,THE LEGEND WILL LIVE ON,"This was an outstanding adventure film for the entire family. A young knight wrongly accused as a traitor, fights to restore his King, Richard the Lion Hearted to the throne stolen by the king's brother, Prince John.Only the beautiful princess Rowena believes Ivanhoe is innocent, and she shall stand up to all who would defame him. My kids loved the great battle for the castle fortress with it's wall to wall fighting and sword play. No matter what you're looking for,""action, romance, adventure; IVANHOE delivers it all""."
4,Part of an excellent trilogy,"While not as good as Sabriel or Abhorsen, Lirael is a good story in itself. The main complaints I have with it is a somewhat drawn out beginning, and no strong conclusion (fixed by simply reading Abhorsen next."
4,Pretty Good... but...,"After finishing Sabriel, I could not wait to start this one. It did not take me long to finish it, and overall it was very good. However, I did not like Lirael as much as Sabriel, who was barely in this one. But the thing I did not like most was Sam, Sabriel and Touchstones son. He was very whiny and annoying, and self centered. He was very off putting and I hope he will grow up some in Abhorsen- which I cannot wait for! Don't get me wrong, this is a great book, but the characters are not as good. Though not as good as Sabriel, i still reccomend it for those who liked Sabriel."
5,Lirael: A wonder of Literature,"Lirael is fantastic, a book with believable characters and an apocolyptic plotline. Don't let the word Apocolypse bring you down, this book is as original as it gets. Created with drama and imagination, this whole series is poised to become a classic to sit alongside the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Read it before then, it's a true wonder to be sure."
4,"After Sabriel, this was harder to get into","I found this a harder book to get into than Sabriel. It is hard for me when the authro changes protagonists half way through the trilogy. The first part of the book was a bit slow, hence the lower rating than I gave both the first and third books. Once the action started through, I was hooked. I do not like it when an author leaves you hanging at the end of a book, but since they were all three already published, I can live with it. (Don't you hate it when an author leaves you hanging and then you have to wait a year to read more??!!) If you get into this one, you'll have to read the next."
5,Old Kingdom,Nix and Stanek are two of my favorites for YA teen books. I read all of Nix's Keys to the Kingdom and now reading the Abhorsen ones. Sabriel is my favorite so far of this new series. what I liked best were the parts with Sameth and Clayr.
4,Great series for fantasy readers of all ages.,"Older readers may be put off by the marketing which puts this fine book in the young adult market, but they shouldn't be. It's strongly written and compelling by any standards and is no more of a children's book than Lord of the Rings.I didn't find Lirael quite as strong as Sabriel, hence the four stars rather than five. But I'm still going to read the follow-up book as soon as I can."
4,Pretty Good,"I really liked this, which surprised me since I usually don't like stories about kids of characters in previous books. It got a 4 star rating because I thought it was a bit slow in the beginning. This book may be a bit better than Sabriel in the sense that you don't know what's going to happen as much. Being a prequel to Abhorsen, it let's you get to know the characters, but the plot does not surface till the end and then continued in the next book.I found the switching of veiws somewhat annoying because I liked Lirael more than Sameth (the prince), but that might be because I'm a girl and Sameth's a boy. All in all, this was a pretty good book."
4,good,"Though this book wasn't as action packed and enthralling as I'd hoped, I still love it. I'm disappointed with the fact that it really was a couple hundred pages just to set up for the final installment, but I can't help but love it in spite of myself. I'll probably read it again in a few years :)"
4,Great book.,"Lirael is the second book in a great trilogy by Garth Nix. Lirael is a Daughter of the Clayr, women who can see into the future. Lireal is growing older, and still doesn't have the Sight. She is not like the dark skinned, fair haired Daughters of the Clayr. Feeling like an outcast, she escapes to the library of the Clayr, where she makes a friend, and a few enemies. This book follows her adventures and the adventures of the young Prince Sameth who she meets during the book.Lireal was a great book, detail, action and fantasy all mixed up to make a great story. Sometimes it could get a bit confusing, but in the end everything seemed to work out. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good fantasy book.M. Sulc"
5,Best Sequel Ever!,"Most sequels aren't as good as the originals, but this one was great! It is about Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr, but a misfit even among her own people. No one knows who her father is and even her mother was considered a little strange. The worst part is that she is the oldest girl in the Clayr without her powers. She is so frustrated that she goes looking for trouble and eventually ends up creating her only friend- a dog made entirely of Mage marks. Later, after overhearing Sabriel and her husband talk about the troubles in the Old kingdom, she embarks on a boat trip where she meets the prince of the land.The book ends rather abrubtly, leaving everyone yearing for the next book, to tell about the evil magic that is to come. I know that I can't wait!"
5,Read Lirael,"You have to read this book. It is filled with everything anyone could want, romance,emotion,magic,and a plot that could be that book, what was it Harry who?The only thing that could be better than reading this book is living it."
5,Deep,"This book lirael is one of th deepest and moving books I have ever read. (and trust me I've read a lot of books) lirel and mogget, two very likeable characters blend into plots twists and always keeps the reader on their toes. A crackling good read."
5,Intriguing!,"A wonderful new story that is told in the Old Kingdom. This story revolves around Lirael, a daughter of Clayr. There is only one problem; she doesn't have the Sight. At 14 it's unheard of for a daughter of the Clayr to not have the Sight. Well, that's not the only problem... her mother has left her and she doesn't know who her father is, and she doesn't look like ANY of the Clayr. Though this story centers around Lirael, it is also has a sub-plot about Sabriel's son (if you don't know who Sabriel is, you should read ""Sabriel"" first.) Sabriel's son, Sam, is not the perfect Abhorsen that he thinks he should be, but the last thing he wants to do is disappoint his parents, and going into Death. This is an intriguing story filled with twists, but it alsot deals a lot with destiny, and what you are made to do. Although I dislike the thought of destiney, I still liked this book. I'm waiting not so patiently for the next book in the series, Abhorsen."
5,Not your ordinary sequel!,"As a sequel to Nix's Sabriel, Lirael holds as much mystifying enchantment as the first novel. It is now many years into the future and Sabriel has 2 children, a daughter and a son. The land has been myseriously attacked and she and her husband must risk themselves terribly to keep the kindom in tact. But behind all of this, there is one of the Clayr, a bastard child who is diffrent, visionless. She who is key to the upcoming surge between the forces of the Charter and necromancy.Follow Lirael's new generation's tale and be prepared to cry out for more when the book ends. Believe me, you'll be aching to read 'Abhorsen' by the time you finish."
4,Prize this book,"While this book begins a story and leaves it hanging, it is the real thing. There are very few books that create a compelling alternate reality, although many authors try. Garth Nix' characters seem real, and the magic also seems real. Not quite enough is revealed about the way the magic works, or the history behind it - the way Tolkein never said much in LOTR about the other rings, or other wizards. Nix gives you an inkling, but not an understanding. In Lirael there is less time spent in death than in Sabriel. If you read Lirael, you will wait impatiently for the next volume."
4,Good but not great,I had waited years to finally read the sequal to Sabriel which I consider one of my favorites and equal to anything I have read in adult fiction. Lireal was descent and interesting but a very slow beginning to the series of two new books. The ending was abrupt and the meat of the novel didn't really begin until the last say 50 pages. However I eagerly await Abhorsen since the real story seems to be underway.
5,Not the best book in the series but better than most books,I like Sabriel better but I don't think you could get a better book than Sabriel. That's my opinion. This one was too long compared to the other Sabriel but way way better than the books my teacher says I have to read in order to grow up.
4,I'm very picky.,"Not many books get 5 stars, that's saved for those so good I refuse to put the book down & read it in one (maybe two) sitting(s). This is a good book for younger folks (those past the few pages/large print books)."
1,Loved the first one....,"The first one was the best i loved it. When i found out there was a second book i jumped at the chance to buy it! I started it and could never finish it. I really liked Sabriel and her character but when i started Lirael i was like 'what is this!!' i hope the third book is better but i dont see much hope in it. Like a fool i will buy it since i have the other two and i MIGHT (notice the BIG might) get around to trying to read Lirael again, but i doubt it. I would not recommend BUYING this book. Read the first one, then BORROW the second. if u like it then buy it. but dont spend ur money right away. i dont think its worth it."
2,Hoops,Earring were not strong at all. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. They are stylish for a younger girl.
2,Cheap quiver attachment,Why Horton would design the cheap cheap attachment that holds the quiver to the crossbow I don't know. Mounting nuts strip out of the quiver block very easily and no fix that I can see. I would hesitate to ever purchase another Horton product based on the cheap design of this attachment.
1,conservative punk,"I would give this band 0 stars if I could.Horrible music, horrible band. they are also conservative 'punk', which is the biggest oxymoron ever."
1,Falls Apart,"We loved this system when we first installed it (professionally) but soon found that if you do not pull it straight out (and only up to 2/3 of the way), it falls apart and you have to reassemble the whole thing which takes several minutes (not just a simple matter of sliding a drawer back in). This does not work in our reach-in closet where you are pulling the drawers open from a slight angle and it does not work for my 6 year old daughter. I reassemble a shelf/drawer at least once a day."
1,Terrible,"This book is one of the worst books that I have bought thus far in college. I am in Calc 3 right now and my opinion keeps getting worse of the book. They should have at least put the correct answers in the back of the book if they were going to put any at all. It's really hard to learn what they confusingly try to teach you, let alone not even know whether your answers are right or not."
1,Horrible,"I am a college student in Calculus 2, and my experience with Calculus books in the past force me to believe that a monkey could have picked a better book. It is hard to understand and confusing."
4,What?,"All these great songs and no ""Islands In The Stream""? The biggest coutnry hit single in history? Must be a labeling conflict! Yikes!"
4,Best 36 inch for under $1500,"Originally sought a 44-52 inch projection TV, but the performance of this set for the price won me over. Great picutre, good color, sufficient connections for a true entertainment centers (2 cable In ports, - 1 for TV, 1 for Satellite - 1 cable Out port to split to another set, Component Inputs, 2 RCA In ports, 1 S-Video for DVD, 1 RCA Out to Amp). Terrific as a gaming/DVD viewing platform. Lighted multimedia remote is terrific, compatible with a mix-and-mash entertainment center (Technics, Samsung, Sony & Motorola parts, all compatible)..."
4,Booties Review,"Good quality. Used and abused for one week straight, everyday. They held up and still look new."
4,"Comfortable, but not for extended use","I bought these for my trip to Bonaire since the boots I use in Monterey are heavier than I needed or wanted for warm water. They fit great (no size issues whatsoever) and the purge in the back was a nice feature and worked well.The only problem that I had was the pull tab at the back chaffed my skin raw above my ankles. Granted, I used them for 3 to 4 dives per day over several days before this happened. In the end I folded the tab down behind the heel and held them down with my fin straps so I could give my scabs time to heal. I will be removing the tabs later this week so I can continue to use them for all of my warm water trips and pool work.Long story short - great boots, but remove the ankle tabs (or replace them with a fabric loop that hangs down)."
2,Product Review,"I bought this product as a Rosecea sufferer wiling to try anything. it worked for my mom so I thought I'd try it.It looks like some reddening in my cheeks has gone away. But if that is the case, it is very slight. After using it twice a day, daily for 3 weeks - would I buy iy again? probably not."
4,Disappearing Redness,"WOW, this product really works. I put the lotion on and it really does tone down the redness, I was skeptical at first but when you have rosey cheeks all the time your willing to try just about anything.The downfall is the size of the product compared to price. It says to use twice a day and there is only alittle over 1 fl oz in the full size bottle.I will still be a life long customer :)"
3,Wacky movie,"I bought this because i remembered it coming on mtv years back and i never seen it all the way through. Well after watching it at a later age now, i can say i kinda regret purchasing. Well it isn't horrible and i'll probably rewatch it sometime. Comes with regular version and the dubbed version with the rappers, not a bad deal."
3,the subtitles...suck,"I had/have no desire to watch the ""rapper"" dubbed version, but the subtitles for the Korean version are perhaps the most annoying I have ever encountered. I can tell when someone is ""yelling"" and have been able to identify ""thunder and lightning"" since I was a child. Every time a door slams the subtitles will let you know...so, here's the trick...the story is simple and a bit ridiculous...turn off the subtitles...you won't/don't need them. It's Saturday morning crazy fun. Everyone is cute and over the top. It's mindless and will leave you wanting to kick and buy a wire so you can fly. Wanted to like it more, but, well...I can't. It was very OKAY!"
1,This is a joke,"We Americans need to get with it, or at least the studios should give us more credit. To think you have to show a bunch of hip hop rappers prominently on the cover of a movie that doesn't and shouldn't have anything to do with them is sad. Sad that most Americans wouldn't take a second look without that being used as the cover and sad that the studios feel they must do it."
3,"Like the Matrix, it's Overhyped","This movie was generating some hype on some movie forums and by word of mouth, so I decided to check it out. In the end, I have to agree that the plot was kind of ridiculous. Usually, special effects complement the movie, but this one just went overboard on this one. If you want a movie that uses special effects wisely while retaining that aura of pure fun and enjoyable experience, I recommend something along the lines of ""Shaolin Soccer."" I might even recommend ""Ping Pong"" over this. It has a very comic book feel to it, and to be honest, I thought it was at least better than the slew of recent comic book movies (e.g., ""X-Men 2"", ""Hulk"", ""Spider Man"", etc.). I was expecting more from ""Volcano High"", but there are some people who might get a kick at the adrenaline-like antics this movie provides. Might be worthy enough to see once though."
4,One side crap - other side great,The first side of this movie has the 80 minute American MTV version dubbed by rappers and the like - and is quite honestly crap. It is supposedly the directors cut - but the way it is cut changes the original storyline and is confusing especially if you have seen the original.There are three cuts of Volcano High the original Korean version(122 min) the International version(100 min) then the American version (abt 80 min). If you flip the disk over it does containthe original Korean version(with Eng subtitles) this does redeemthe movie to some extent.The basic plot stays the same in all three movies a good boy with supernatural powers who has been kicked out of 8 or 9 high schools gets one last chance at Volcano High where everyonein the school knows martial arts and is after a secret manuscript.my recommendation is for the International version of the movie(it is not too fast -nor too slow) then the original versionthen lastly the American version.
3,"Fun movie, good picture/sound, stupid CC Subtitles","If you're in the mind for a over-the-top, crazed, charged, genre-bending action-comedy movie, then VOLCANO HIGH is a good choice. It has great energy and interesting performances from the stars. The anamorphic picture is quite good and the sounds is very good. It is really nice to have the original Korean movie, as i find the MTV version nearly unwatchable, but the real annoyance here is that the english subtitles are CC english subtitles, which means there are things like, ""[Thinking]"" or ""[Rumbling]"" that show up in teh subtitles, which are just too irritating.4 stars for the movie-1 star for the bad subtitling."
5,awesome movie,i bought this movie today and i think tha MTV verson was funny and k but tha orginal was way better do to tha fact that i wasn`t edited...
1,Movie sabotage? Accomplished.,"Ok, it isn't like this film was the Film of the Year or anything, but it was entertaining... until MTV got ahold of it and ghetto'd it up with a bunch of rappers doing stupid voiceovers. The voice acting on this is sooo out of place and honestly embarrasing. I would ask ""what where they thinking"" but judging from the cover art, it is clear. You can practically hear the Viacom execs saying, ""Hey the kids like those rappers and that Wu Fu Clan game is popular! Let's get rappers that can't act do the voices for a Korean fighting movie! Word!"" Yep, it is that sad. Buy the import, avoid this turd."
1,This is complete piece of crap. Don't waste your money!,"The people giving this piece of crap five stars are either insane or work for MTV or have actually had a hand in making this waste of space and are trying to rip you off to cover their own butts and whomever's money was spent to pull off this fiasco, If you are unfornuate enough to sit through this boring dud, you can tell the artists don't give a damn about it and probably read their lines, grabbed their check, and hit the road in under ten minutes. Don't needlessly throw away 81 minutes of your life on this and don't be fooled by whomever is planting five stars on this turkey or the use of the artists pictures on the cover because they obviously aren't into it just like you won't be."
3,Fits with the movie,"I, myself, thought the movie was quite fun to watch. It wasn't boring, and the activities never seemed to stop. The songs did add a lot to the movie. Although some people did not like some of the songs, others did. My favorites were ""I will learn to love again,"", and of course ""Mr. Roboto."" But who am I to say if its good? You watch the movie, listen to the music, then decide."
4,a good love story,"This is the on again, off again love affair of Gabrielle and Dante who's a pro football players. At first I wanted Gabrielle to keep on forgiving Dante for all his wrong doings, but then I realized he was just to selfish for his own good. She went through so much trying to make him happy. But it's a good read to find out how they try to make it through all the problems they had."
5,Snap shots,"J.Jermayne is one of the best authors of all times. The novel snapshots is a winner. The book will keep you wanting more. She will for sure reach the homes of millions with this great book. Her work is so real you feel where every character is coming from .I am so excited about her up and coming novels. This novel will be a best seller,We need to be more realistic about what's really going on in the real world. She covers all of that. You Go Girl!........"
3,Snapshots and the Glamour,"This book dislayed a love story not usually written about in books. It was very insightful as far as the ""glamorous"" relationship goes. It had a major twist to it, which made it so fun to read."
5,THE UPS AND DOWNS OF LUV!,"THIS BOOK WAS EXCITING,AND PLENTY OF DRAMA I LOVED DANTE' BUT THEN AGAIN I HATED HIM FOR THE THINGS THAT HE DID TO GABBY. IN THE END I GUESS IT WAS WORHT IT. THE STORY COULD NOT HAVE HAD A BETTER ENDING!!!! I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR N-E BODY SO TAKE HEED EVERY-1 BUY THE BOOK AND READ THE BOOK.YOU WON'T PUT IT DOWN UNTIL IT'S OVER.IT'S LIKE MS. JERMAYNE TAKES THE THOUGHTS RIGHT OUT OF YOUR MIND AS SHE WRITES.IT'S THINGS IN THE BOOK THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO."
5,SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE,"I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK BECASUE IT SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING WE CAN ALL REALTE TO IN SOME WAY. IT TEACHES YOU MANY LESSONS ON LIFE AND HOW CAREFUL YOU SHOULD TAKE THINGS TO BE. IN THE STORY, THE MAIN CHARACTER'S(GABRIELLE)LIFE SEEMS TO BE PICTURE PERFECT BUT FINALLY TOWARDS THE MIDDLE IS WHEN LIFE IS NOT SO GREAT ANY MORE. THIS BOOK HAS REALLY GOT ME TO THINK ABOUT LIFE AND TAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT MORE SERIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU CAN COME ACROSS. LIFE IS ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE, JUST LIKE IN THE STORY. THE BOOK SHOWS US DIFFICULTIES IN LIFE, THAT MANY OF US GO THROUGH. THROUGH OUT THIS YOU MUST KEEP ON GOING IN LIFE AND NEVER GIVE UP. THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE MAIN CHARACTER DID. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT MIGHT TEACH YOU A FEW THINGS YOU WOULD NEVER EXPECT TO HAPPEN."
4,This book kept me on the edge! It really is good!,"This book is great! J.Jermayne gives the positive and negative sides when falling in love with a person. She also writes about the sacrifices that have to be made in order to be with the one you love, and how to know you truly do love that person. Once you finish reading this book you will know if you truly are in love if you are willing to make half the sacrifices that many characters made. J.Jermayne is a realistic writer and this book should definitly be a ""must read"" book for all the young adults."
4,Interesting,"'Snapshots', by Jacquelyne Jermayne, was a very interestingbook. I liked it very much. I give this book four stars. In spare time, I would consider reading this book again. I would recommend this book to people torn between their careers, and their love life."
5,Much greater than superior!!!!,"I liked the book ""snapshots"" because it gave me a picture of what was going on. Also, because I felt what the characters were going through. If you want to fell the ups and downs and turn arounds, I urge you to read this book. You're be amazed at the outcome."
3,TRUE LOVE,THIS PARTICULAR BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING. IT DESCRIBED MANY CONFLICTS THAT YOUNG AND OLD COUPLES HAVE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE NEXT NOVEL. TIERRA GIVENS
3,Twists and Turns,This is an easy read with a few twists and turns ! The writer makes you feel the pain that each character is going through.
4,Lifelike Situations,I thoroughly enjoyed reading Snapshots. I have known many football players in my life and it was very interesting to see the way they were depicted. I felt it was a truly dead-on description of the ups and downs involved when dealing with someone who is used to being idolized. The difficulties for both parties to come together and make it work were very realistic.
4,IT KEPT ME READING,I loved the book Snapshots by J. Jermayne. The book kept meon the edge of my sit until the very last page. The book toldall about the problems in life and relationships have. The bookkept you glued to it. Making you not put the book down until youwere finish. I give it 4 stars; it is a great book that all teenagers should read.
4,IT KEPT ME READING,I loved the book Snapshots by J. Jermayne. The book was very interesting. The book described all the problems in life that relationships have. Snapshots had you wanting to read the entire book that day. I give it 4 stars; it is a great book that all teenagers should read.
5,The guy from New Mexico doesn't know what he's talking about,"Not only does this guy not know anything about comedy, but obviously has no sense at all, since he agrees with Leonard Maltin. While I'll say that I liked ""Delirious"" more than ""Raw,"" they are both utter classics. I can watch them a near infinate amount of times, or just listen to his 3 comedy cd's. New Mexico man says that all Raw is, is Eddie using the F-word a lot. Well, New Mexico, have you seen any comedy inthe last 30 years? all the comedians use the F-word too much. But the difference with ""Raw"" is that it is used in context, and it doesn't dampen the effect of the rest of the comedy. New Mexico man should consider going back and reviewing ""Raw"" and maybe trying to look around on Amazon auctions for a sense of humor"
2,"A ""Raw"" Deal From Eddie Murphy","Disappointing follow-up to Eddie Murphy's ""Delirious,"" with some genuine laughs overshadowed by mean-spirited misogyny. Though his dazzling mimicry remains intact, Murphy lacks the incisive brilliance of Richard Pryor and gradually burns out his concert material. ""Raw"" also suffers from Robert Townsend's generic direction - surprisingly uninspired for a theatrical feature. There's a reason why Murphy abandoned stand-up comedy in the late 1980s: He had nothing more to say."
5,love it,"it very funny i love every minute of it. eddie murphy at his best, no other like him. i love it"
2,A Big Disappointment,"Taped it off of cable but wouldn't pay money for it. The problem is that this is where Eddie is now a star and thinks or seems to think that everything that comes out of him is funny. ""Delirious"" was new and fresh and Eddie came off as suprisngly likeable and cocky and talking about things that are genuinely funny anyway like relatives and family outings, Elvis, etc. whereas this just sounds like Eddie yanking his own chain, trying to convince himself or someone that he's ""made it"" to the star ranks with Michael Jackson and Mr T and instead of 18 year olds getting their first experience we hear about Hollywood lifestyles and so forth. This is less funny and basically Eddie should follow his own advice and squeeze some jokes in inbetween the cursing."
2,It Depends on Your Tastes,"This was a gift for someone who can take the ""Raw"" part and thinks it's funny. They love it; for me, it's just not my cup of tea, although I like Eddie Murphy in his movies. I'm just not a ""Raw"" person. I don't like that, even from otherwise favorites."
1,Reason Why Mr. Murphy Now Makes More Family Films,"This stand-up comedy act is sexist, racist and dumb! Mr. Murphy attacks everyone equally but now it is easy to see why he makes more family oriented movies. At least he woke up and discovered that all comedy need not be full of foul language to make people laugh."
4,Definitely Funny But Not As Funny As delirous,"Eddie has some funny moments in ""Raw"", but it failed to have that rolling on the the floor effect that delirous had. All in all this was Eddie at his best, and the Eddie we see now is far removed from that era; however, he seems much happier now."
2,Not so Funny,"My husband chose this movie because we wanted to have a good laugh, it didn't even made me smile.. Movie/jokes too old? Maybe."
5,Very funny.,After all these years Eddie Murphy is still the best. Very funny and entertaining. Had to keep the kids in the other room though.
5,Classic Comedy,"Eddie at his very best, certainly not for the kids but funny, he defines funny in this one!"
5,Eddie Murphy Raw,"This is one of Eddie Murphy's released movie version of one of his live stand-up performances. Eddie talks about divorce and relations between the sexes, but also goes into some of the problems he's encountered because of fame, including offended listeners and fans who continually greet him with his unprintable catch phrases. Whether you like Eddie Murphy or not, his performance in ""Raw"" is quite a show, and his song medley at the end is a hilarious finish. If you've never seen this movie you're in for a treat."
2,NOT ALL THAT FUNNY,"THIS CONCERT, WHICH IS EDDIE MURPHY'S 2ND CONCERT FILM, IS VERY DISSAPOINTING. MOST OF THE JOKES GET REDUNDANT AFTER A WHILE AND SOON, IT JUST BECOMES UNFUNNY. THE BEST MOMENTS ARE WHEN EDDIE MAKES FUN OF BILL COSBY AND RICHARD PRYOR, WHEN HE MAKES FUN OF THE ITALIANS, AND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HIS FATHER. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS MOVIE COULD'VE AND SHOULD'VE BEEN A WHOLE LOT BETTER. THE LOWEST POINT OF THE FILM IS THE FINALE IN WHICH HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE HAD TO EAT TOYS BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS SO POOR. I'M A BIG FAN OF EDDIE MURPHY, BUT, I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THIS IS ANYWHERE NEAR AS FUNNY AS ''DELIRIOUS'' WAS. IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T CHECKED IT OUT YET, DON'T EXPECT TO LAUGH TOO MUCH WHEN YOU SEE THIS MOVIE."
3,Considerate Seller,"The product was not in stock, but I was reimbursed quickly. Please try to make sure that products sold through Amazon are in stock and available for delivery."
2,Not that good.....,"Eddie Murphy is awesome, lemme say that right off. However, this video is subpar in my opinion. He seems to spend most of the time complaining about how women are out to steal his money, and most of it is sorta funny at best. Check out his video ""Delirious"", it's 5 stars, and way better."
2,Not as funny as the reputation states,There is little doubt that Eddie Murphy is a great Comedian. However I was highly disapointed with his supposed best work in the field of Stand Up. His jokes only focused on 1 primary area and that is how women and men are different. For 90 minutes it is one long run on joke that gave me a few chuckles in between. Overall this is not as great as the reputation states. This is in fact a renter at best.
2,look n read 1ST,It wasn't what I thought that was. My fault. Everything else was a-ok tho. I thot that it was a greek commentary ann not just a few comments on romans .
3,Fair DVD,"Not as good as the other Indian Head Massage DVD or books that I have read or seen, but fair, and a fairly good deal for the money."
1,For just one song... Ugh!,"NOT my kind of music. I could not find ""Stay"" as a single ANYWHERE. This album might appeal to heavy drug users or the lunatic fringe. Stay turned out to be a VERY expensive song... I guess that is why they came up with iTunes and buying just one song in the first place right?"
5,LONG LIVE THE SISTERS,"HORMONALLY YOURS is the best album I know.The voices of Siobhan Fahey and MarcellaDetroit work together very well on thisalbum. It's an album full of dark pop.Music and lyrics are brilliant.My favourite song is ""Hello"". It interpretsthe loneliness, the isolation and individualizationin our society and sounds beautiful and melancholic.""Stay"", ""I don't care"", ""Moonchild"" and ""The troublewith Andre"" are other highlights. There's no songon this album that is terrible. Two women go theirway! This is also shown in the video collection."
4,Hormonally Yours- Shakespears Sister,My resent purchase of Hormonally Yours by Shakespears Sister was very securely and very well packed and arrived at my doorstepsafely. My receipt was well pesented and packed securely. Overall I was very happy with this product and I highly recommended itto anyone.Vanessa FordHormonally Yours
1,Terrible optics,"I had purchased this telephoto lens adapter to screw on to my Canon EF-S 55-250mm. Had it functioned well, I'd have an effective 800mm focal length (250mm * 2 (lens adapter) * 1.6 (crop sensor)).Unfortunately, the lens is terrible. It's fuzzy and produces a hazy look. At full zoom, the camera has difficulty focusing and objects look as though they're being seen through a dirty window...or cataracts. Moreover, chromatic aberrations are extreme. Blue and red fringing on both edges of any high contrast object.I've not tried this on my shorter focal length lenses, so I can't determine what the quality is for those or how much the haze is diminished. What I can say is that this is NOT good for long focal length lenses."
1,Junk,"This came with my ""kit lens"" for my Canon camera. I really thought I got ripped of on the camera because I could NOT get a good shot using this. Took camera to local photog store and they diagnosed my problem - in life you really do get what you pay for. I wasn't the problem, my body wasn't the problem, this extension glass is. I've learned if you want to take good zoom pictures then you need a good (read - expensive) lens. Same goes for the wide angle made by the same company. Both worthless and unfortunately going in the trash can because they are useless on my camera."
3,Ok For The Money,"I wanted a telephoto lens to try out on my Olympus Evolt E510, being stuck on a tight budget at the moment, this is all I could afford.It looks well made, fits good and seems to work fine. I took some nice photos with it that came out very well.A decent starter lens!"
4,Good Deal for under $40,"I bought this exact lens (digital concepts 2x lens) with a 0.45 wide angle and macro lens in a package deal. It is well made, durable and does what its suppose to. However, beware of the following:1. The listed magnification is dependent on your sensor size: only type 1/3"" and smaller will experience the listed 2x magnification (I have a nikon coolpix p5100 with a type 1/1.72"" sensor and get a 1.26x magnification)2. The lens only uses 2 elements in 2 group so there is some sharpness degradation at the perimeter of the lens (decent quality)3. As with all add on converter lens, even the expensive ones, your optical view if you have one will be blocked among other things (focus beam etc - depends on camera)"
1,"""International"" version","Everything the previous reviewer said holds true. This kit is an ""international"" version, which does not include any medication or medicated ointments."
1,Numerous missing items,"This seemed like the perfect kit to bring on vacation -- light, fits in a pocket of my cargo shorts, and has a little bit of everything to handle just about any mild injury suffered along the way.Needless to say, when I popped it open to retrieve some ibuprofen today (the first time I've used the kit), I was a bit surprised to find that not only was there no ibuprofen: There was no aspirin, no antihistamine, no antibiotic ointment, and odds are I've missed something else which they left out.I guess when they call it a ""light and fast personal kit"", they mean it's light a couple items because they packed it fast.Very, very, very annoyed & disappointed."
5,A Great Movie,I taped this off HBO and must have watched it 75 times the summer of 1987. It is without a doubt the best baseball movie I've ever seen and it always makes me remember that year of playing baseball and watching this movie. It seemed like that summer lasted forever.
5,"Agreed, great movie","I'm with everyone else rating this movie. I think it is one of the greatest baseball movies ever. The humor, satire, and irony that comes out from the love affair is great. The social issues of ""teen"" pregnancy (not sure if she was a teen or not) and race relations in the South are played on greatly by the actors. If you can find it, keep it, they ain't making no more of them."
5,William Petersen Rocks!,"It's been years since I've seen this film, but I would buy it on DVD in a flash! I saw it on HBO when it first came out and it is truly one of the best baseball movies ever -- and just fun even if you're not a baseball fan. I was a fan of William Petersen (one of the most bow-legged actors ever!) prior to CSI and this was one of the main reasons. (Another fun movie of his was ""Hard Promises"" which is available on DVD) As other reviewers have said, Long Gone captures the real character of minor league baseball and the characters who inhabit it. Would love to see it again!"
5,Great feel for the game,"I love baseball. I grew up watching AA and AAA ball in upstate New York. . This wonderful little gem of a film captures the feel of minor leaugue baseball better than any other film I have ever seen. Bull Durham is certainly a better known film, and Kevin Costner showed some real baseball skills, but it lacks the gritty humor of Long Gone. Petersen nailed his role as Stud Cantrel. He plays a man who has come to terms with his limitations but still has some fire left in his belly when it comes to the game. I agree with many of the other Amazon reviewers. This is the best baseball film of all time."
5,Simply Put,"This is by far the best baseball movie ever made. When do we get to see it on DVD? Cecil ""Stud"" Cantrel is not only the best character from a baseball movie; he may be the best character in any movie. William Peterson is the man. Is there two better movis than Long Gone and Manhunter? I doubt it."
4,The best baseball movie you've never seen.,Like any movie your characters have to be enjoyableand they are. Studs(Bill Peterson) is so real and fun.I watch it every summer.Because it takes place in the 50'Sit doesn't look dated like Bull Durham. It doesn't takeit self too seriously it has it's story to tell andtell's it.Waiting to see it relesed on DVD.If you like Baseballyou'll like Long Gone.
1,Switches Die,"I had purchased three of these flashlights about a year ago. The outside construction of the flashlight looks good and has a quality feel to it. However, the battery holder inside is very cheap looking. The switch for the flashlight are in the back end base. The switch action is hit and or miss, sometimes the light comes on, sometimes it doesn't. Of the three Dorcy flashlights I bought only one has a still working On/Off switch. Not impressed!"
4,I can see now!,"I've had this for about a month now and was very impressed with the brightness of this small flashlight. This is my first and only LED light. Great spot and intense white light.Brighter than my two cell AA mag light, and other two cells but not nearly as bright as my five cell D mag light.I don't use this a lot. Perhaps a minute or so per day. There is a marked change in brightness over the month, though I'm not sure that it is time to replace the batteries. The light is now about equal to the small mag light.Initial impression was five stars, but I've lowered that to four and may comment more after I change batteries. Still a very good buy."
2,The sound and clarity is not very good,"While this is the Swan Lake performed by the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, the sound and clarity of the film leaves a lot to be desired. The filming of the ballet is poor and the screen is mostly dark and close ups to show the facial expressions are missing. Hence, frankly I was a bit dissatisfied with the purchase."
5,My book is actually called 'Drina Dances in Italy',"Due to the different names I got mixed up and thought this was the second book not the fourth. This one is really fantastic and Italy suits Drina so much. Some of the best in the series are the ones where Drina is abroad, such as this one, because the descriptions are so vivid and of course the stories are excellent! Please disregard my previous review as it was on the wrong book."
5,BEST THRICE ALBUM EVER!,"This is a must have if you're a Thrice fan. So totally differnt, yet so good! Don't pass this buy, if you are having ANY thoughts about buying this album, DO IT! You'll thank yourself!"
5,....,"perfect...only owned it for two weeks and its by far the best album ive bought in a long time. gives me more than my needed dose of musical healing... ""Of dust and Nations"" and""The earth will shake"" do nothing less than remind me of the way rock music is supposed to resonate and shake the foundations of our existence."
5,WOW!,This album is a whole new experince. I fell that this album is almost emotionally draining. The best work of thrice to date in my opinion!
1,I used to like thrice but grew out of it.,A friend of mine bought this cd when it came out. I borrowed it and listened to it a few times. It's just whiny emo like everything else you'd expect. I liked thrice about 4 years ago. Can't stand them now.
1,This CD is just boring!,I have to say if your looking for a cd that is powerful and intense and full of raw emotions then this is not the cd for you!I was very let down by this cd.Im not saying that musically these guys suck at all cause they are very talented.BUT THIS CD IS ALOT SLOWER THEN THE PREVIOUS CD'S THEY HAVE DONE.It seems like the majority of the tracks on this cd start out with a boring piano part.I became very upset when i first got the cd and was trying to find a song to really get into.Most of the songs are predictibale for one.Very little Screaming going on.Their is nothing exciting about this cd at all.
1,THRICE-VHEISSU,"THIS ALBUM SUCKS. THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO NEW JERSEY, WRITE ANOTHER ONE, AND RE-SUBMIT IT TO THEIR RECORDING LABEL. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED , I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER THRICE ALBUM AGAIN! UNLESS, IT'S TWO TO FOUR YEARS OLD."
1,"These screamo bands just don't stop coming, do they?","All the screamo bands sound alike, and this is no exception. These guys are the same talentless musicians seen in the other screamo/emo bands. Whiny vocals and p***y lyrics coupled with puke screaming and simplistic instruments. Other than that, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Avoid this and get Kreator's Pleasure to Kill.Alan Hargrove can go pack fudge, because that's all you're good for. Go back to playing ""wiener whistle"" with the members of Thrice.Thanks to the 1 star reviewers for backing me up."
5,It's all in the name,"This being my first Thrice experience I must say I am thrilled! Their artistic talent is seen clearly in this album. Being a frequent student of Etymology, their artwork, lyrics, and overall mesh of the God and man connect the listener to the reigning goal of Thrice as artist, to give the Creator all the honor."
5,Astonishing and Phenomenal,"Thrice kicks the cliche modern rock music scene in the face with this album! Vheissu is everything the you wouldn't expect Thrice to create! This proves that all rock music is not heavy distortion or about being ""so cold"" or ""cold""!!! This album has feeling and meaning. Thrice fans will definalty be pleased, though it wont be anything you expect at first, after a few listens you will be captivated by this record! Thrice does not get enough credit for this masterpiece!!!"
2,"exciting for some, disappointing for others","I'm one of the old fans of Thrice, one of those blown away by ""Identiy Crisis"" and ""Illusion of Safety"". Like the others said, these guys are very talented...but are now a completely different band. If you listen to the tracks and pretend that it is not the old Thrice, its not such a bad album.HOWEVER, for those of you old fans that were disturbed by the transformation that presented itself in ""The Artist in the Ambulance"", that was the tip and ""Vheissu"" is the iceberg in its entirety. Teppei's guitaring has been reduced to a BGM (this hurts the most as I am a guitarist), the drumming has become very mundane...the list goes on.In conclusion, if this is your first look at Thrice, go for it by all means. For old fans, lets just say that I'm demoting them to Twice."
5,One of the best albums I have ever heard (Coming from a new thrice fan),"First off I am not a kid I am an adult I just did not feel like signing up for an account.This was the first Thrice CD that I bought and boy oh boy is this a GEM.I am a huge fan of music, I listen to Radiohead, The Cure, Oasis, Coldplay and other such bands, and this cd is nothing less than SPECTACULAR.I was reading previous reviews and someone said that this album is almost emotionaly draining and that is exactly how I would describe it.I would put this album with OK Computer, Disintegration, Whats the Story, as my all time favorites.Folks, you dont really get much better than this.I went back and listened to Thrice's older stuff after buying this and it is terrible especially TAITA.Vheissu is not just an album IT IS AN EXPIERENCEIf your a fan of any music do yourself a favor and please get this."
5,A new change,"Everybody who is giving bad reviews likes to base it off Thrice's older music.Their old music was good, but Vheissu shows a new Thrice, a band that has moved on to a deeper and emotional album. If you have never listened to Thrice before, this is truly an awesome album, and if you have been a long time Thrice fan, listen to the album a couple times before you blow if off."
1,The Most Disappointing Album Of The Year,"I am a huge Thrice fan, and I love every album that they have done up to this point. If you like any of Trice's earlier albums this album will surely put you to sleep. It is a total change from punk/hardcore to a mellow, easy listening, pseudo Cold Play music. The radio friendly We Are the Invisible is the only half way decent track on the album, but you'll be sick of it after you listen to it twice. This album is boring, lyrically weak, and bears no resemblance to anything Thrice has ever done. If you like anything you've ever heard by Thrice buy any other album but this one."
2,Not thrice,"I'll make this quick; If you loved the heavy, technical sound of thrice's previous records, you won't like vheissu. There are only 4 songs on here that sound like the thrice I knew, the rest are a complete 180 from the original sound. Download ""image of the invisible"", ""like moths to flames"" and ""music box"", then call it a day. Not a bad record, but not for me. I give them credit for trying new things, but the only reason I really ever liked thrice was for their heavy riffs and catchy melodies. Without those elements, thrice just isn't the same."
2,Why did you do this THRICE?!!!,"First off, Teppei, who I believed to be one of those most intellcual-guitarists is virtually non-existent in this record. He was once quoted in saying that in the Illusion of Safety he did nothing but riff the whole time. Well not anymore, and if he does you can't hear it. Thrice's music seems to have taken on an artsy flavor, as if to say ""we're smart and we think about stuff so were gonna go out of our way to make a record that isn't our style so that we can prove we're versatile"". Well to me all they proved is that they abandoned what they were best at, which was amazing musicianship and intensity. This record is very whiny and there is generally no complex musicianship, with a few exceptions. Almost every band puts out an experimental record, and they all suck. So yeah."
2,Disappointing,"Definitely the worst Thrice album to date. While all the songs are decent, nothing worth listening to, except maybe ""Earth Will Shake."" The other 10 songs are, in my opinion, boring and repetitive. Also, Teppei's guitar playing is absent...they seemed to focus more energy on the minute long introductions and strange Radiohead-ripoff background noises instead of the actual music. I still love Thrice but this cd is terrible, to say the least."
2,This has been the worst year ever,Wow... lots of high hopes for this album... lots of dissapointment to follow. i see nothing wrong with a group playing with their sound... but when a band that has done basically the same thing for three albums completely places themselves into a different genre... i get a little upset. this is a post-hardcore band tyring to create a post-rock album. this album is slow and not heavy at all. very little screaming... very little riffing. thrice basically made themselves experimental post-rock... they even used morse code on the album... wtf? if you're a big fan of thrice... you're going to hate this album... but you should give it a try anyway... just because it's thrice
2,Just don't like it,"Truth be told I don't like this album very much. I am trying to give it a chance because this has happened before but i just can't into it. With their other albums, I put the CD in and just let it play. I find myself skipping songs on this album which to me makes it not worthy. Just a little disapointed. While i fully understand that they are growing, I just want something not so polished, that is what drew me to them in the first place. I hate polished and over produced. Anyway that is my two cents."
5,Album of the Year?,"This new release from Thrice is nothing short of stunning, I understand it is a big departure from some of their previous works but for me it is perfect.If you were looking for influences then you could namecheck bands including Cave In, Deftones and Dredg but to be honest Thrice have created a unique sound all of their own.The songs are beautifully crafted with crashing heavy guitars one minute and piano-led melody the next. I must confess to not being a fan of 'screamo' bands but the small amount of screaming on this album somehow fits perfectly with the songs and is almost necessary, the majority of the vocals are melodic and epic which also best decribes the album as a whole.Genuinely this is probably going to be my album of the year, I can't imagine anything coming close to being this good for a long while."
2,It's all been said.,"Every negative feedback on this album review seems to fit it perfectly. Don't get me wrong I love Thrice and I own their other albums but this album was either extremely out of charector, or it was just awful. I've tried for days to grow to like this album. Not only that but I leant it to 3 friends who are huge fans of thrice as well and they don't even want a COPY of this album. Why steal music you don't want to hear?"
3,coldplay?!,"I'm writing this review as many here keep referencing coldplay.The Americans must have a very different view of coldplay from us Brits do, they shouldnt even be mentioned in the same breath as a hxc band, albeit a hardcore band that evolved into more of a rock band. Coldplay are a dull , insipid, overblown indie band who thirty something squares listen to and cry along with."
2,All Over The Board,"Thrice appears to be in that crossroads that many bands face: Do we stay our course or do we veer in a different direction? Unfortunately, Thrice doesn't seem to be sure of which way to turn judging by all the different styles they attempt to employ on this recording.And to make matters worse, if that isn't Skid Row's ""Youth Gone Wild"" on the opening track, exactly how much closer could Thrice have come if they did a cover version of it?"
1,New Thrice?,"I've been listening to thrice ever since their debut c.d. came out. they've remained hard-hitting and in your face rock through all their c.d.'s. i noticed on artist in the ambulance a change. not a change like the new c.d. has but still hard-hitting but more singing, more melody in the vocals. it was still awesome. the new c.d. is slow, slow, slow, with the exception for about 2 or 3 songs. the lyrics remain awesome as usual but for the actual music of ""thrice""...i would say people that fell for thrice for their hard sound, ripping guitar riffs, and screams of anger...you wouldn't be too happy with this new one. it's still good, i mean if your feeling depressed but as far as how it compares to the old thrice...they might as well have changed their name and never used the name thrice again."
3,"not what they used to be, yet some creativity still shines.","Short and sweet. Old stuff is better. Love some of the new stuff. Lacks flow, Can't listen to over and over, and it's (though I regret to say it) a mark of the end of a band that had ( and has ) something special. Although they took a great chance, and it holds in some places, it fails in the end. STILL a Thrice FAN, but still very sad."
2,wow,"IF YOU ARE EXPECTING ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY HEAVY, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! i cant believe they made us wait almost 2 years for this crap. probably the most disappointing release of the year. this was the only rock band i still listened to (i've moved on to metal/grind/tech metal that sort of thing). Now i cant even enjoy my last guilty pleasure. Thrice, you should be ashamed of yourself."
2,ummmmm..... thrice?,"terrible, if i could some up this cd compared to the illusion of safety and identity crisis... this is TERRIBLEdo not get me wrnog, this may be your thing if your into more emo/screamo. its just not thrice anymore, bottom line.1. image of invisible - sounds like artist int he ambulence2-5 screaming mroe screaming more unneccessary guitar shredding.6- artist in the ambulence sounding7 and 8 - screaming9 - this is the good stuff. dust and nations stays true tot he original melody of thrice upbeat, rock, screaming mixed in with lyrical sounds10 - screaming11- i geuss thrice always has one slow song, but i dont even count this as a song.save your money, get the ""illusion of safety"" or ""identity crisis"" or the new ""if only we could see us now"""
2,A Cave-In Rip Off,If you dig this album just buy Cave-In Until Your Heart stops they were years ahead of these Thrice copy cats. And they are better too. Trust me.
1,Thrice goes Thursday?,"...thats what I remember thinking after listening to ""vheissu"". I hate thursday, and even though thrice has been compared to thursday in the past, there was almost so similartity. Now there is. If you like coldplay, thursday or radiohead, you'll like this. If you want the REAL thrice sound, get artist, crisis, or safety instead."
2,Dissapointing sound...not talent,"Well its not what I was expecting. I do like the fact that Dustin actually sings and sings very well, but its just not Thrice to me. Illusion and Artist are still my favorites because they are close in style and music. I miss Teppeis wild runs and Eddies crunching bass riffs. Riley has definetly improved on drums, but the album as a whole just doenst do it for me. I like hardcore and metal that has melody, Im not just a screaming junkie. As far as comparing them to Coldplay...I felt the same way after song 9. Im all about bands maturing and writing better music...but this doesnt sound like Thrice except for a few songs. Ive been with this band since Identity Crisis came out and will remain, but Im just dissapointed with the sound...not the talent"
2,Boring,"I wouldnt say its really horrible but it kinda sux. Its so boring. I loved,""illusion to safety"" and ""the artist in the ambulance.""Most of the songs are slow. It makes me want to go to sleep. They got way too soft.From the reviews you either like this album or hate it.Most of the old fans of thrice ...do not like it and neither do i."
2,Thrice? where are you guys,"wtf!!!!!!! what happened to the fast moving punk attitude with the hardcore/ metal approach on illusion of safety, now that album is one of my favorite albums ever, coming from a huge metalhead, and now let me tell you i love alot of soft stuff too, like alot of prog rock and this just sucks i want to hear the old thrice, this is not even progression it sliek they did nothing to these songs theres only one good song, Image of the invisible, now that is some amazing thrice right there, but every other song is garbage, why do none of the other songs have the energy that that song has, amazign singing, chanting, awesome chorus, guitar, i tried for days now to listen to this and see what its all about but there not even the same badn anymore, the last album rapes this, and that one is kinda diff too but still thrice, this is just BOREFEST"
2,Where'd the rock go?,"Dissapointing after ""image of the invisable"". The rest of the disc is slow. I understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it, which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd, but I'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another Artist in the Ambulance or Illusion of Safety. Did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album? Maybe the songs will grow on me, but they will never feel like the good old stuff."
5,"Not a Crisis of Identity, an Evolution","I have been a Thrice fan since I heard the version of T & C from First Impressions with that crappy solo and Dragon Ball Z intro. And yet, unlike many of the so-called Thrice 'fans' posting reviews here, I have no problem saying that Vheissu is the best Thrice Album. Nothing will ever replace Illusion of Safety. Nothing. It is what it is. But Vheissu is better. The guys aren't 19 anymore, they have grown up, their musical tastes progressed. If a Thrice fan has a negative review of this album, it is because they have a short-sighted, narrow, and poor understanding of the wide musical spectrum. A fan of music is not someone who likes only hardcore, or only punk, or only emo. A fan of music understands that music is music, and is valid in all its forms. Thrice, with this album, has done something new, and yet retained their identity. This is no crisis of identity, this is just Thrice, grown up, making their most mature songs to date."
2,What the hell happened????,"If you were expecting anything resembling any of Thrice's previous works.....then you will be severly disappointed. Gone are the fast drum beats and awesome guitar work replaced with slow repetitive songs. The only resemblence between this album and old Thrice are the great lyrics. I'm all for change and all but this is something completely different and is in no way experimental in any way contrary to what the album is being marketed as. If I wanted to listen to a Radiohead or Coldplay album (which I would definitly NOT want to) I would have done that instead. The only saving grace of this album are the songs Music Box, Image of the Invisible, and Red Sky and that is why this album did not get one star.I still support Thrice nonetheless and really do wish them the best because they are really great people, I just wish they hadn't come out with this album."
3,Some Ok. fighting but....,"I put this DVD (a friend gave it to me?) into my player and awaited the titlescreen to appear. And so it did.. This was not at all what I had expected, something out of the ordinary. You really have to see it for yourself, I can not give away the plot. I would just like to recommend it to all of them karate nad Kung-fu fans outthere"
3,Not worthy of 5 stars,"I've been listening to a lot of piano trios these days, mostly in recordings by the Beaux Arts Trio. I picked this CD up due to its (at the time) 5-star-only reviews on Amazon, and since there aren't many recorded versions of this music out there. This CD is ok, but I don't connect to the extremely romantic-era, expressive playing of the Florestan. Sorry, but I just don't consider this trio to be in the top tier of trios. (I do prefer the pianist to the two string players in the trio.)I'm still looking for a great rendition of these trios. This Florestan recording isn't it."
4,fun unusual item,had it about 4 months now - works fine so far.made of plastic it's marginally cheap in feel but on the wall it looks great. Gets plenty of comments.EDIT: Dec 2009 - Still running fine!
3,squirrel feeder,"I have not had much luck w/ feeder. In rainy season, when the food comes out it gets wet and mildews."
4,Slow going,"Although this book was a good mystery, the text moved at too slow a pace. It wasn't a mystery that I couldn't put down. It's worth reading if you like the Jessica Fletcher character."
2,"M:I-2 Impossible, Improbable, Impotent","This doesn't look at all like the John Woo who directed Face/Off. I would say that John Woo was way off mark with this one. Brian De Palma did a much better job with the first, M:I-1.M:I-2 is all flash and no story. There's not much more to say. We've seen all before."
3,A tepid Woo-fest action flick,"I tried to avoid being caught up in the hype for MI2, but was still disappointed. The love interest seemed very out of character for the Ethan Hunt we saw in the original MI, and left me somewhat cold. The amount of face changing going on made me think the movie should have been Face/Off 2, not MI2. And Woo's directing trademarks had a habit of distracting me from the movie, leaving me thinking 'oh yes, another Woo set piece'. For me the movie was a great disappointment, but I'm sure many people will love it."
3,Good action flick but implausible,"Fast paced, lots of action, but really implausible. The incredible disguises seem to appear magically. Still, we enjoyed it and Phillip Seymour Hoffman makes a terrific bad guy."
2,Not a good use of story or characters,"Over the top action, movie went too long for the story being told. On the list of movies I will watch only once."
4,love it,Love this movie. Third installment is still my favorite though (hence four out of five stars). Good quality picture and sound.
1,AWFUL,"This movie was not only stupid, but it also stained the MI series with a huge inconsistant sequal. The storyline is just plain shaky. Tom Cruise was NOT the Ethan hunt that he was in the first one. He turned into some into some guy who laughs at everything, he lost ALL of his charm that he had in the first movie. This was a TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! The characters were so differnet then the first one, and gosh the worst part of this movie was how inconsistant it was from the first one. Only buy this if you absolutly have to, but let me warn you, it is a WASTE!!!"
2,Hugely Disappointing,"As a great fan of Mission Impossible 1, I had great expectations for the sequel. Oh, what a disappointment to see the franchise ruined by tedious and all to common car chases and fight sequences. Ethan Hunt is too smart to get into a fight such as the one in the climax of this movie. Where is the intrigue, the espionage, the thinking man's Ethan Hunt? Apart from the cool opening sequence there is little in my opinion to redeem this movie. The Producer made a fatal mistake in getting John Woo to Direct this movie. Whereas Mission Impossible 1 is firmly entrenched in my DVD collection, the sequel will not be viewed again by this reviewer. Not recommended."
5,Superior Sequel,"I'm surprised about the negative reviews. This movie had what the first lacked--a plot. Also, John Woo's directing is amazing as usual"
1,"Another Hollywood ""Blockbuster""","Here it is at its finest, the typical hollywood ""pre-fab"" movie. Boy meets girl. Boy-Girl falls in love. Girl gets herself into dangerous situation. Boy rescues girl and saves the world in the process. BOO TO MR WOO! This movie was one of the most predictable movies to date. I'll give mine away if you pay the shipping!"
4,It's just an action movie,"People need to calm down and look at this movie as it really is...an action movie. Of course the stunts aren't realistic and the love story is pretty cheesy, but that's the magic of movies. The movie supplies wonderful eye candy and you can't help but love or hate the characters. Get this movie and sit back, relax and soak in the magic of John Woo."
2,m:i-2,"This movie does not compare with it's predecessor, the plot is very cheesy, and the love scenes even cheesier (especially that terrible car twirling scene). The action sequences are nice and tight, but that is all that John Woo knows how to do well. The entire movie is laid out, and predictable; which on the other hand, being what made the first one so good (all the back and forth temporal activity, much like a Pulp Fiction style). Worst of all, this movie has the feel that is was just made to make money, and boost Tom Cruises ego, stardom, and bank account."
2,Movie 3 stars - Streaming 2 stars,"Saw MI-1 and somewhat believable but this was all about action stunts which were pretty good but way over the top bordering stupid. Too many super close ups of Tom Cruise and not enough of his hottie co-star.I would have given three stars but Amazon streaming and picture quality not very good. I purchased HD version and several times movie stopped citing bandwidth but never have this issue using Apple TV, Hulu, or others."
5,Don't let the impossibility of it get to you,"It is a visual masterpiece and a MUCH easier plot than the first Mission Impossible. Just don't let the horrible shooters, overly done explosions, and other things of this nature get in the way of the movie, focus on what you r watching and enjoy it, its awesome, highly recommended"
3,It doesn't work on centain DVD players,"I rented the disc and won't play on my Philips DVD850AT player. I tried on the famous Apex 600A, it worked! While the DVD 850AT (that has a Dolby digital decorder built-in) was made in Japan and cost nearly 3 times more than the Apex 600A. I never have any problem with neither players, this is the first time I have trouble with a DVD disc that won't play in my player. I believe a lot of people will face the same problem that I had, because that Philips DVD player was made by Toshiba, as far as I know.I think these DVD asso. people are stupid enough to put region code on it and now, they are doing some even more stupid trying to get some new standard out that won't down competible to the original standard!The sound quality of this movie is good, the picture quality is the worst I have seen among all 40 + movies I have seen (at work and home). The story is far worse than the original Mission Impossible movie."
1,Bad!,"After I heard that John Woo was going to be making Mission Impossible 2. I new that it would be all action and no plot. Boy was I right and everyone else out there who predicted the same. I understand that movies are here for us to enjoy. But I predicted 98% of this film. The chase on the mountain with the car was ok but the motorcycle chase was totally unbelievable. Cruise is not at all believeable enough, to be able to flip a gun up in the air from the sand with his foot like he did at the end. I did not enjoy this film from the begining. The acting was cheap and bad. Only Anthony Hopkins was good. The sound and special effects were also bad. Grade:D+"
1,Unusually dissapointing,"Although a usual fan of both Cruise and Woo I found myself fighting the urge to leave midway through the movie. As incredible as Woo may be in his gravity defying stunts (half the stunts could win the high jump in the Olympics), this movie was just a bit much. I loved Face Off, but MI2 has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Boring plot, bad dialog, no charismatic acting, a general bore."
4,Mission:Perfect 2,"I enjoyed this sequel to M:I. Several years have passed. Ethan has changed quite a bit and so has the world. An average plot but a very interesting and sexy love triangle between Ethan, Nyah and Sean Ambrose keep you intrigued. All of this going on while Ethan tries to keep his mind on Chimera and how to stop it.John Woo adds an interesting, and active pace to this sequel. The only complaint I have is the rating on this film. If this were rated ""R"" I definitely could see myself giving this 5 stars in this version. The cinematography was mind blowing. My favorite scene was with the motorcycles. The high speed car chase between Nyah and Ethan was great too! Anthony Hopkins was a suprize cameo appearance. As I said in my review of M:I, don't compare this to the first M:I. They are two very different films."
4,Good Movie,"good movie. cheesy at times. many of the stunts seem impossible to pull off, but the shots are awesome. does anyone know who is singing when Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) is rock climbing in the begining"
1,PURE CRAP!,"This movie stinks! The acting is average, the directing is good but bad for John Woo's average. Why so many close-ups?? There wasn't that much action until the end. The scene at the lab, very similar to M:I1 and if that was supposed to be one of the first action scenes why fill it with slow motion?? The story was a bit similar to the X-Files movie! The thing with the virus and the female lead infected with it and the male lead saving her. (In my opinion the X-Files: FTF was much better) - Also there are many cliches in this movie, predictable. In total, terrible movie. Be sure to expect after the success of this in a couple of years M:I3"
3,Not Bad-Not Good Either,"I was a bit dissapointed by MI2,especially considering the talent involved.Director John Woo could make riveting cinema out of a trip to the ATM,and Tom Cruise is usually much better at heroic lead roles.I thought the plot was a bit forced and illogical(thogh not as bad as the first one),and we've seen all the stunt sequences before.Even the great Anthony Hopkins couldn't generate any heat in a sly supporting role.And am I the only one who's sick of that peeling-off-the-mask-revealing-a-good-guy-when-you-thought-it-was-a-bad-guy(or vice-versa)gag? That got old really fast.Still,it's got a good soundtrack,and it certainly doesn't give you much time to contemplate it's flaws when you're actually watching it,as it roars by in a fury of explosions and wooshing camera moves.The DVD doesn't offer much more than the usual extras(interviews,behind the scenes,commentary),so if you're already unimpressed by it,I wouldn't waste your time."
4,"Grab a beer, sit back, and enjoy!","...This my friends is what we like to call an ""entertaining"" film! Please tell me why films were first invented?... To entertain us! Not for us to go ""Well thats not very realistic!"" Let your self go for christ sake!! This is a good all round film. You have great action, lush locations, beautiful lady (and Tommy boy for the ladies!), and lots more. The thing is about most of the other reviewers is that they have a serious look on the film. Its John Woo! Expect great action, fantastic cinematography, and a fast pase! So what if the first one was beliveable with a better story line! It makes the two nice and different! Don't get me wrong the first was better but don't take movies so seriously! I dont want to talk about the plot though. I find it far better to watch a movie when you know little or nothing about it! So enjoy! It looks great, it sounds great, and it is great! Thats all you need to know my friends!"
2,This is not Mission: Impossible,"When they teamed up Woo and Cruise to make this movie, they should have just called in something else. They eliminated almost all of the M:I team, leaving only Vinge Rhames to play 10 minutes on the screen. This is a Cruise-fest, plain and simple. And Woo's insipid filming technique, which for the most part does work in martial arts only movies, falls on its face. In a story that is supposed to be somewhat believable, we watch Cruise and cast complete hilarious stunts including a midair chest to chest impact of Cruise and baddie going at about 60 mph (120 mph impact) each. Please! And the repetitive use of rubber masks, upon rubber masks became boring, trite, and downright stupid after awhile. If they would have titled this movie something completely different, I would probably like it more. But this IS NOT Mission: Impossible."
1,What a disapointment,What a disapointment this movie was. I used to love MI as a kid and it was built around the team concept. Where is the MI team here? This is nothing but Tom Cruise doing dangerous stuff. (That should be the name of it!) Granted the action scenes were well done but so long and added nothing to the movie. It appears Mr. Cruise wants to be a poorly acted James Bond. Well if that was where he was going he got there. My recommendation! Rent it don't buy it.
2,Its So Bad Its.......Bad,"What a steaming pile of .... this is. I thought Tom Cruise was better at choosing his projects but this is a return to his Days of Thunders/Cocktail days. The movie is just so high on itself. The scene where the two motorcycles fly up in the air while the two ""heroes"" fight belongs in a cartoon. Don't get me wrong I like dumb cartoonish movies like Starship Troopers but John Woo takes this movie too seriously. Even Anthony Hopkins's eyes (his cameo) were missing his usual fire.Some people in Hollywood are WAY OVERPAID."
2,"High On Action, Low On Everything Else","Mission Impossible II was a movie that was good on action and low on everything else. John Woo's great action sequences are second to none and should be well applauded. The story line of this movie though completely sucked. This movie should have been called, ""John Woo presents: Ethan Hunt and his worthless team-mates and foes. Ving's Rhames performance was almost as non-existence as Halle Berry's in ""X-Men"". And I `am sorry but, Dougray Scott did not make a believable villain. How this movie grossed so much money I'll never know. This was almost as bad as watching ""The Perfect Storm""...almost."
1,Mission Impossible 2 Directed by ... Tom Cruise?,"This has got to be the worst John Woo movie I've seen since Broken Arrow. I really don't understand why this movie didn't do anothing for me, but I was on the verge of falling asleep through the whole thing. No action sequence for about 1 hour and 15 minutes? This isn't Woo! When I go see a John Woo film, I go to see the cinematic gunplay and the beautiful camera work. The camera work is there, but the action is absent until the end of the film. I won't go on much longer, but it seemed to me John Woo took a back seat to Tom Cruise, who was directing himself .......... Sigh, another disappointment in a long line of disappointments. At least one good thing came from this film -- the makers of X-Men fired Dougray Scott because he had to finish filming this movie and they got Hugh Jackman (kudos!)."
2,Jackie Chan or Tom Cruise?,"This film did not live up to it's billing. I went to the theatre wanting to see ""Mission Impossible,"" but was forced to settle for little more than Jackie Chan.The story line and plot were descent, the execution of it was farless than! If you are in the mood for quasi-martial arts, this is your flick. If are interested in high-tech gadgets and gizmos that are synonomous with ""Mission Impossible,"" better look elsewhere.In fact the only thing impossible about the movie in general was the fight scene at the end. Could it have possible been longer, more unreal, or more unlike what ""Mission Impossible II"" should have been?"
2,Ohh Dear......,"...Mr Woo is well known for his flashy camera work but he went abit over the top with this film. Impossible shouldn't mean completely unbelievable. The effects are, as you might expect, excellent and all the actors do a passable job under the circumstances. I have quite enjoyed some of John Woo's previous movies but feel this film would have been a lot a better under someone else's direction (Renny Harlin maybe). My advice is try before you buy."
2,Pity about the plot,This is a example of how special effects has been taking over films rather than acting. Don't get me wrong i love big budget action scenes but it helps to have a plot. Its clear that the plot has been written to fit around the action sequences not vice versa. Lets hope there is no M:I3
1,this is a very bad movie ..,"i dont know what has gone wrong with mi2 .. the first was good .. it was one of my favorit's .. but since i heard that John Woo is going to make this one i knew that some thing well go wrong .. i hated this movie i realy hated it , i mean i realy tryed to faind something good about it but i cant .. the story would make a 6 years old kid feel stupid .. the acting was way too bad , even the effects .. there wasnt any .. it felt like a van dam movie .. but a lot more worse , if you didnt see the movie yet dont buy it ,you only can rent it and see it once i mean some of you may like it .. but i dont think that any body could stand seeing this stupid movie more than once."
1,Bond is better.,"Mi2 just steals from bond movies,so cliché, pigeons..etc. Seems to me that people who thinks mi2 was original and good action movie, havent seen much films, or they watch only films that are ""hot"".. MI1 was much better.. Woo has surely lost something,imagination."
2,even tom cruise can't save these movies.,"Missin Impossible is about a GROUP of agents who fight the enemies of freedom, criminals, and drug dealers etc. This movie is the second one to feature a lone agent fighting american traitors. snorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. It looks better on blu ray but I had to sell this after I watched it because it's just a bad movie. Imo, tom cruise is actually a good actor, he was great in several movies too but this series is just another bad secret agent movie which can't even find decent villians to fight. Hollywood made money on this one because cruise was in it but most people will not like this flick after they see it. Why not come up with villians we can relate too? evil madmen , cults, evil drug gangs, communists , far right fanatics, muslim or other relgious fanatics. but not another evil agent flick."
2,A Decent Sequel - Must be an Impossible Mission,"There was no plot, very little character development and even the special effects weren't very impressive. Buy it used, if at all. Not a very entertaining movie."
1,VERY VERY BAD sequel -- get the first one insead,"Mediocre story, too much hype, and dismal acting (Tom, what were you thinking??), made this one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. Thank god I didn't buy this one or pay full price at the theater... I was very close to doing that based on the merits of the first one.In a way it's a fitting followup ... take everything that made the first movie work (gritty action, special effects, suspense) and show how NOT to do it. Trust me -- rent it first."
1,A great failure of a movie...,"MI2 is simply a bad movie. It is classified as an action movie but really most of it is not action, just bad dialogue. MI2's premise is not bad, Hunt trying to recover a deadly strain of influenza from his arch enemy, but it is all just flushed down the toilet. There is some action, but in no way does this film compare to its predecessor, very disappointing considering it was directed by one of the very best action directors of all time, John Woo. If you are a serious fan of MI or a Cruise fanatic then rent this (certainly don't buy it), however for casual fans of action films, you can do better by just watching the original again."
3,Sexy but too shallow. Too bad they didn't see the potential!,"Well... since the long awaited second release of Tom Cruses Mission Impossible series came out I really did some thinking! This movie isn't all that good! The first Mission Impossible is so much better, with better plot and action sequences than this one.Since the totally cool James Bond films came out the pressure was on to make this movie sexy and sleek but as they tried that they lost a lot of the potential.I actually prefer the James Bond films because they do such a great job at making it all blend."
3,Mission to Make a Blockbuster,"If you're looking for great action and...effects this film does it all. If you're looking for a deep plot and expect to be emotionally involved don't bother. I was entertained and that is sufficient for me for this type of film. But what I found really fascinating was the way in which an old Hitchcock plot was reworked in the script. It used many of the same plot points of my favorite Hitchcock film 'Notorious'. A woman of questionable moral standards is sent in a top-secret mission to use her charms with a criminal who happens to be an old intimate acquaintance. There is a car chase together to heighten the...tension between the government agent and the saucy heroine. There is a poignant scene at the racetrack. The woman falls ill by the villains hand and the hero must save her thus sealing their love. How interesting that Tom should be the new Cary Grant, but I guess it was inevitable."
3,Great special effects and action but........,"...the plot was defintley lacking. Not much acting going on here. The special effects and action is the only reason this got a 3. When this movie came out, they gave it 3 of 4 stars because of the action and special effects and said it had no plot. They said the same thing about ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and gave it 2 stars. Of the 2, I liked ""Gone.."" better than ""Mission..."". A big part of why this didn't do it for me was there were too many dead parts. It needed more action. Also, the widesreen really took away from this as about a third of the screen was taken away from top to bottom. I couldn't believe just how narrow it was. Though I did like this movie, if #3 comes out, they better make it more like the 1st one, or it's gonna flop."
5,Outstanding Action Movie,I love the action/adventure genre and this is one of the best. This movie is good enough to watch more than once and is a must own movie.
3,Mission Improbable,"As a Bond fan I was looking forward to seeing this action film. The storyline is very weak (as in Bond). However the characters seemed very one dimensional and did not interact well and seemed unbelievable at times. That said the action sequences are very good, just what you would expect. Loud, in your face, fast and the chase scene at the end is almost like a queue of stuntmen and directorrs all having 3 minutes to outdo each other as the finale becomes more frantic, outrageous and improbable utilising every type of vehicle the production people could get their hands on.But these scenes are made for DVD to play over and over, and coupled with enough extras to keep even a region 2 fan happy, it has to be said it is value for money."
4,Action-packed Feast,"Tom Cruise has once again captured the minds of his fans. The only problem was all the face-changing, you couldn't really tell when they were real and when they were wearing a mask. Action-wise, this film could possibly be better than the previous Mission Impossible, with great effects, and many great points."
4,Good Story,"Hey if you liked the original Mission Impossible with it's cool gadgets, latex masks and surprise endings you will be mostly satisfied with MI 2. The only bad thing about the story is it's very predictable. Mission Impossible was great because of the complexity of the story, in MI 2 halfway through the movie you know exactly what is going on!Many things can be said however for the special effects, the awesome stunts, (performed largely by the star himself Tom Cruise) and great cast. Overall MI 2 is a success and definatley worth renting if not buying! Especially if ya like Tom."
4,MI 2,"100 times better than MI 1. This one is a fun, fast, and enjoyable thriller with all the action needed to get no break at all. Its still very vague on plot line, but that didn't bother me. A very enjoyable watch."
1,A Travesty Of A Film,"As a diehard fan of the original television show Mission: Impossible, I was appalled by what Tom Cruise and John Woo have done to this once-honorable franchise. They took what was a subtle, creative, sophisticated package and turned it into a completely generic action movie. Mission: Impossible was about outwitting the enemy--in this travesty of a movie, any enemy who gets in Cruise's way is simply killed--Pathetic and generic. To top it all off, Cruise and Woo are obsessed with gunplay throughout the movie, something the producers and directors of the original television series INTENTIONALLY did not use. They wanted their characters to THINK their way out of situations--Woo and Cruise just shoot everything until somthing works. I had high hopes for the potential movie series after the first one came out, but I will NOT be seeing any others--I'll just go watch Face/Off again (A MUCH better John Woo movie....)"
4,great movie,I taught this move was good. There was allot of action and it keep you alert to see whats going on next. I really taught this one was way better than the original MI1. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the fake mask making crap kinda cheated throgh the movie
4,"Great movie, but with some minor generic action scenes","This movie is a great action movie, and in my opinion, even better then the first Mission: Impossible Movie. The movie has awesome explosions, fight scenes and chase scenes, but also contains some generic ""action movie type"" scenes. Nevertheless, this movie is still worth buying, and once you get bored of the movie itself, the DVD's extras, such as a short about the making of the film, will keep you watching."
2,Worst kind of ripoff,"Remember the days when you were writing term papers and realized that every third sentence was a quote, so you started parephrasing, but it just didn't sound as smooth? Well this is what this movie does. I am amazed that the scriptwriter has the guts to claim this as his own. He ripped off the scipt from Hitchcock's ""Notorious."" Of course he changed the Nazi's trying to get their hands on uranium to the ""evil greedy corporations"" trying to get their hands on a deadly virus only they had a cure for, but the rest is the same. My favorite part came on the ""making off"" part, where Tom Cruise talks about how good and original the writing is. It made me gag.To be fair the special effects and the stunts are good, but I think they might have plyed better on a video game."
2,A major disappointment,"John Woo is one of my favourite directors. Face/Off is probably one of the best five films ever made. But this is just awful, lacking all the elements which made Face/Off what it was - the strong story and the human element, not just the spectacular action sequences.M:I 2 is just a money-making machine. The story is just another Bond-film reject script which won't hold your interest past the first ten minutes. And the film is full - completely full - of blatant product placement.But. It's still got some decent John Woo action sequences. So it's not a total failure. But it comes close."
1,"YAWN ! Another ""Cruise Tribute to Cruise""","The opening was beyond belief! The photography was spectacular and the stunts so unbelievable as to be, well, impossible. Of course, if you're a die-hard Cruise fan, ""acting"" or plausability are not material. The first hour was better than sleeping pills. The last parts had some pretty good (visually) scenes although still only designed as a tribute to the demigod Cruise. Everything else was just dumb. Glad I only rented this one and with a coupon... better yet."
3,"Yikes, some people are hard to please","This movie was a visually stunning, exciting watch. No, it's not a Citizen Kane, but it's a fun and exciting Mission: Impossible. Don't listen to those here who say it was unwatchable, that's just plain ridiculous. I get bored very easily with bad movies, but this one just isn't boring, but lots of fun. MI1 was better IMO, but this one is good. Recommended."
1,This movie is ... awfull.,"Its just plain stupid. I got it out for the climbing scene, which isnt worth seeing and the rest is sooo dull. It takes itself way too serious to be worth seeing just for some cheap action. Tom Cruise you are no Timothy Dalton and you cant direct to save yourself.Eugh"
3,"All style, no substance...","This is a movie that looks great, with a killer soundtrack, some amazing stunts and a halfway decent plot. As a summer blockbuster, it's pretty darn efficient. It has slightly better effects than MI1 (also 3 stars) but a slightly worse story. Like most other summer blockbusters, especially in the action genre, it's ultimately hollow inside. This is a renter, not something you need on your shelf for all time."
1,CRUISE IN HIS WORST PERFORMANCE EVER.,"It will be a while before I watch another Tom Cruise movie again, because the dissapointment I felt after watching this movie is unbeliavable. First: Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunt, the TV-series character didn't deserve that. 2) The chemistry between Cruise and Thadie NEwton is non-existant. 3) Most action sequences are laughable, ludicrous - the car chase with the female thief, the moutain-climbing without hopes, the jump from the motorcycles, with the two ""macho"" men clashing chest agaisnt chest in mid-air; 4) The mask subject is repeated over and over until it becomes a joke; 5) The coldness of the movie is so shocking, it makes clear the totally formulatic concept of the movie; 6) Hopkins presence is a farse, so brief it is.If all of these motives are not enough to make this movie a turkey, then I don't know nothing at all. I repeat: even watching this as a brainless action-adrenaline movie, it's a horrible motion picture, ..."
2,Woo drops the ball,"Am I the only one who thinks that John Woo is overrated? I have enjoyed many of his films, but he has become a parody of himself. In any given John Woo film, you are sure to see doves fluttering through the air, a stand-off between two protagonists simultaneously pointing guns at each other, a woman whose only real reason for being in the film is to form a triangle with said protagonists, far too much slow motion photography and a healthy dose of obvious religious imagery that has little, if anything, to do with the story. This time around, I just couldn't work up any interest in what I was seeing. It all felt so tired and old. And that motorcycle duel belongs on a short list of the most ludicrous action sequences I have ever seen. This film is only for those who believe that Woo can do no wrong."
2,Just Bad,"I REALLY enjoyed the first Mission Impossible flick, but man, what happened? This movie was really bad, I mean BAD! I got to see this movie for free and I felt so cheated, I wanted to bill them for my time. There seemed to be no heart or anything out of the ordinary/special about this film. I think it is based on a rejected James Bond script. Hey, I love action movies more than most, but this was a poor attempt to capture some of that Matrix market with supposedly great special effects. I felt the fights and action sequences were cornier than Charlie's Angels, which was tongue in cheek all the way. I can best associate this series as going the way of the Batman series. MI:2 - Bad, but still better than English Patient"
1,I'm ashamed to admit I own this DVD,"It truely is THAT bad. I generally catch the majority of movies at home on DVD. It's worth it to me just to buy it and not go through the trouble of renting. I wish I had rented this one. The plot is idiotic and contrived. The whole way through the movie I was telling myself, ""Ok it'll change gears in a minute and all this BS will have been some type of foundation for what comes ahead."" Wrong. This is by far the worst movie I'd watched in 2000. If you have sooo much time and your hands and are bored to tears with absolutely no way to entertain yourself ( no paint drying or grass growing anywhere to watch ) then buy it but be ready to turn it off as soon as somebody starts painting. Also have a good hiding place for it so it isn't visible in your collection else you suffer the embarassment of owning this pathetic excuse for a movie."
1,Lets take a holiday in Australia Tom.,"Oh! please Tom, lets take a holiday in Australia. I want to see my Mum and Aunty Flo. And , hey, while we're there you can make a poxy, unbelievable crappy sequel to that 'b' grader you made a few years back. We can overkill on all the sights of Sydney and fill it full of cartoon-like fight scenes and irrelevant shots of Sydney Harbour and it don't have to have a viable story line or anything...what do ya think huh???? Do you think the mugs will go for it?? Hey, and while we're there we can catch the Olympic Games and everything. THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTE EMBARRASMENT"
4,MI2,"Much more action than the first movie. This one however, should have been called Mission ""Yeah Right"". Many over exagerated moments..."
3,chase and fight scenes becoming boring,Story ok but and would be good movie. The chase scene and fight scene get boring as they drag on too long.
2,Stupid!,"So many times in this movie you just think ""really!"" Stupid! Story line. Action stunts. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! and Stupid!"
5,mission impossible,"A fast paced, action adventure film. Excellent plot and a movie one never tires of re-watching. Always a unique story"
2,Can we say plagiarism?,I was watching this on TV recently after having seen it only once before when it first came out and it dawned on me that it has the same basic storyline as Hitchcock's Notorious with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman (1946). But the result is vastly different. Notorious doesn't rely on high-tech props or unbelievable stunts - just pure good acting and suspense like only Hitchcock can do it.
3,More Explosive Than The First,"The first movie was pretty good. The second movie is a decent followup with more explosives, more action, and more stunts. The only thing is that it slowed down on plot, story, and its appeal towards a mental capacity above the third grade.A lot of people really appreciated how ""smart"" the first movie was. Some people complained about it being a bit confusing so for the second movie they dumbed it down. Did it work? Well, it is hard to tell. First of all, the second installment did make more money but won less critical and audience acclaim. Personally, I prefer the first movie over the second.My biggest complaint was that they tended to do the face-switching game way too much. Every other person wasn't who he claimed to be. In the end, they just used it as a copout whenever they couldn't further their plot without something original."
1,overachieving action flop,"This has be one of the worst movies ever made. The prolonged slow motion fighting scenes, the sentimental music, the pathetic apperance of Anthony Hopkins playing the cliched older wise man. All these things combined produce strong vomit reflexes in my gut. When Tom Cruise and his enemy charge at each other as in a joust on motorcycles and then leap off them to land on top of each other the unintentional guy on guy action oozes all over the screen. And when the movie ends with children carrying baloons i know that i have wasted precious timw with this garbage.unfortunatley metallica sells out and lends their music to this dud."
2,"Yes, Cruise can carry a terrible movie.","Most who watch this lukewarm movie-making mess of a debacle will wonder why they waited around till the visually stunning (if not Woo-cliched) final action sequence, which is the only redeeming aspect of the ""film"". Tom Cruise, a usually competent actor, gives a sub-par performance, but manages to look pretty through harrowing action sequences. Depth in a performance is achieved only by Thandie Newton, who isn't really seen much in the film, unfortunately."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!,"I'm out of breath after watching this movie ... What was going through the producers heads when shooting this thing ? Only money, I guess ... There was a way of making a better folloup than this tragedy here: I think Cruise, Woo and the others could just sit in front of theirs VCR's or DVD's and watch the first movie... People that are saying that this is better than the first must be John Woo diehard fans, forgetting to see the truth, which is: this is one of the worst story lines ever made on screen, on the same level of the worst Van Damme's movies !! With one big difference: TOm Cruise is on it. I can't believe it. The team is gone, Ving Rhames plays a ridiculous small part, the leading female character is not good at all in acting skills..well, enough. See for yourself."
1,dumb movie,"i don't like this movie. it's extremely unrealistic. almost nothing ethan does is possible. I know it's suppose to be mission impossible, but come on! Some of his stunts are so outrageus, it just looks stupid. The storyline was bad too. but there was one good part, where he used the masks to switch places with the villain's right hand guy. but that's the only good part! watch the first one and the third one. they're awesome! but skip this one. it sucks."
1,DUMB!,"I was SO excited about seeing this film. I am a HUGE fan of the first film. I even went out and bought the soundtrack.This movie was a terrible dissapointment! I put it in, watched long enough to see Ethan Hunt degraded to womanizing, and then decided, that the creaters of the film ruined everything we liked about Ethan Hunt, and then some.I hated this."
2,Wait a second-wait a second-way overdone....,"This was very disapointing to the superior Mission Impossible from 1996. A flat plot, as a plague threatens all of Australia. Oh NOOOOOOO ! Aieeee !Ethan Hunt is sent to assist a former flame of the villan to search and stop him from doing harm down under.Stunts, hardware and action are almost non-stop.Wow. John Woo makes far too much Impossible to happen. Gets you dizzy and laughing.Examples :- blowing a hole in the wall of a high rise and then jumping out of the hole, that's ok, but you could kill someone down below-falling debris..hint-hint!-jumping from your motorcycle at around 70 mph and then jumping in mid air into the other guy dead on???? You'd BE DEAD!!!! LOOOK OUT-OOOOF!!!and other scenes that are stupid are for you to find out...t.oo bad...it wasn't awful...just not good.....way too..well, IMPOSSIBLE."
3,"Admit it, it is fun.","Plot? Who needs a plot with this movie. This movie requires that you suspend disbelief, hop into your seat, buckle up, and just have fun. If I want plot there are plenty of other good movies to select from. But if I want a roller coaster ride, I'll take this movie. I give it a 1 for storytelling and a 5 for fun."
2,What happened?,"I thought that there would be an interesting plot for the sequel, i was wrong. I thought that there would be interesting action sequences thanks to John Woo, I was right. But, as we have all learned, in this day and age you can not make a movie with just a bunch of special effects. There has to be some sort of a plot to make me want to sit through a film like this. Alas there was none. It was like a second rate bond film. The difference is that in Bond films they do not pull off their faces constantly. What was that all about. It was cool the first couple of times, but after that i only tired of it."
2,Notorious on speed,"Recycle the plot of Hitchcock's Notorious and dress it up with hot motorcycles and computerized special effects and you've got this flick. I like Tom and enjoy the action sequences but the film has no soul. Rent it, but don't buy it, even when the price goes down."
1,Are you an idiot who enjoys being insulted? Then buy this!,"This is crap-ola. John Woo, who really should direct music videos and leave feature films alone, shoots a flick full of slow motion, fire, guns, more slow motion, insultingly improbable stunts (come on, the magic-tired-motorcycle that Tom Cruise can skate beside wearing boots and, when he tires of that, he can shoot backward, aiming with the side mirror?), clothing changes with a speed Clark Kent would envy, and hardcore heroes who fall in love after about 1 hour. Maybe if I scrape out what is left of my frontal lobe, which shrank markedly after viewing this tripe, my lizard-brain will allow me to enjoy all the rapidly moving lights and pictures on the screen."
1,No Plot? No Problem,"This movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen. John Woo tried to cover up his lack of plot by throwing in even more kung fu and explosions than he usually does. After seeing the first film done by a director that actually has talent(Brian De Palma), this film is hard to swallow. The worst thing, I think, is that Sir Anthony Hopkins actually lent his name to this film, if you could even call it a film. I still can't believe that the same brilliant actor who played Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs would agree to do this film."
1,Woo and Cruise fail to deliver.,"With all the advertising hoopla that preceded this film, who would have expected it to be such a huge disappointment? If you have watched the trailer of this film, then you have seen all that is worth seeing in the full film. Woo does not seem to have come out of the 'Face/off' mode, with the slow motion shots and the pigeons flying reminding the viewers of the classier, more enjoyable 'Face/off'. Cruise does not seem to have learnt anything from the first part fiasco as this film slips from mediocrity to outright ennui. The first scene and the last scene are tolerable, but if you fell asleep during the middle part, you were not alone!"
1,NOTHING AGAINST,"I have absolutely nothing against brainless action movies. I liked most of Arnold or Stallone's action movies. But this MI2 cast Cruise in his worst effort ever, a totally commercial effort aiming just at money, money and more money, with an awful cast ( Hopkin was thrown into it to act for three minutes ... ) There's no chemistry between Cruise and the female thief... The villain is a joke, one of worst performances by a bad guy I have ever seen. Let's check the ""action"" sequences: the one in the motorcycles is disgraceful to the genre, mainly when the two guys jump from their bikes. I'm not complaining about reality, I'm shocked by the way Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunt's character forever, changing him into a kind of arrogant and indulgent Rambo. The opening sequence was made, I guess, to show the audience not the lies that would come, but just the lack of heart this movie would show... Irc. The worst action movie I ever watched."
1,Should have gone straight to video!,"This movie has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I am a big fan of action movies, and anything that is similar to James Bond with cool gadgets and cool cars. I understand that some movies will have portions that are unrealistic and difficult to believe. This movie takes that to a whole new level. There is not one thing in in this movie that is believable. They could have made some part of it where an average person could have done one thing in this movie. The acting is terrible, the action is way over done. By the time you get to the end you just want it to be over so you can say you watch. Honestly, I say don't even waste your time renting it like I did on Pay Per View. But at least see it before you buy it. I could never recommend this to anybody."
3,Ho-hum,"First movie was way better, this one is too much about the flashy things, like the stupid car chase where they're spinning around and then it goes into slow motion. This movie lacks real substance, and while the opening mountain climb sequence was really cool, most of the movie drags along too slowly. It relies heavily on the masks and voice changers instead of actual plot. Ving Rhames does a good job with what they give him. I would give this movie 2 stars, but the special features (like the MTV spoof with Ben Stiller) are good."
2,John Woo filtered!,"I am a big fan of John Woo, one of the best action directors in the world! But I must say that it was a big disappointment to see such a weak and trite movie from one of the biggest stars in Hollywood and one of the best action directors in the world! Not only was the story trite and weak, but also the action was very old and unimaginative. To see the brilliance of John Woo, check out Boiling Point and the Killer, two great movies with another great actor Chow Yun-Fat. And most of the action from MI2 was from other Woo movies. Not only did the final battle look fake, but the frantic and fast pace of Woo's other movies were missing here. One thing Hollywood loves to do is to import great foreign directors, then to take away what made them great. And if I see one more white Dove in a John Woo film, I might go crazy. I know it's his signature, but enough is enough!"
2,Not impressive,"When I saw the trailer to this movie it looked awesome. When I saw the movie I swear I heard snoring. Tom Cruise's acting is almost goofy. The film made me laugh but I don't think it was supposed to be funny. Everyone gets beat up by Cruise? How bout no. Story was dull and lame. Steals a line from Last of the Mochicans. I enjoyed the last 20 minutes. And what's with everyone using a mask? Chessy, corny, and dumb. John Woo made a major dodo of a film here."
3,"Viz-stunning, emo-numbing","Who here did honestly not like Face/Off? Or Broken Arrow for that matter? They were both done by helmer John Woo, who left Hong Kong for Hollywood several years ago. Now he has created the second installment in the MI series; which proves to be little more than a nonchalant Tom Cruise vehicle. Not that I hated it, I just expected more. Much more. The cinemotgraphy is of course beautiful, and put together in a sort of arty Jerry ('Con Air', 'Gone in 60 Seconds') Bruckheimer way. But the excitement is only really there for the first fifteen minutes, and the last thirty-five. Predictable it is. Although the acting, especially by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is for the most part crisp and realistic, the overall impression of pic is a slightly lacklustre momentum, interlaced with short bursts of entertainment. That said, I'm still getting the DVD."
3,Great Effects But No Storyline,"Mission Impossible 2 has great effects but i feel that the story line is weak. There are plenty of fight scenes and guns, but not many gadgets this time. Unlike with the first this one didnt grip me and i lost interest within half an hour. After sticking with the film i still wasnt interested, and i think that this film will only appeal to diehard Mission Impossible fans"
1,Fell asleep,Boring. I would enjoyed a rerun of one of the old tv shows much more. I honestly fell asleep. Boring.
1,Roxburgh too good for this film - he deserves better!,"I would have given this movie more stars if Tom Cruise wasn't present in it, and Richard Roxburgh would have done a one man show. The scenes with Roxburgh, and only the scenes with Roxburgh was what kept me alive during the film. Although when that stupid Tom Cruise killed Roxburgh's character the movie ended right there. The scene was when he switched their faces, and I thought Roxburgh's character had beaten the crap out of Cruise's character and they killed him and I was feeling quite happy for the moment, until, they pulled the face off of Cruise and it was Roxburgh instead. I was DREADFULLY upset. And then it showed Roxburgh running, but it was really Cruise since he hadn't pulled off his face yet. He should've left Roxburghs face on (at least he would've looked better), and then he ripped his face off and it was Tom Cruise, thus the movie ends."
3,First one was much better,"I thought this movie copied ""the Matrix"", ""James Bond"" and almost every other kick em' up shoot em' up action film out there. The first one was much better, this one was more for the use of shooting, blowing up, kicking, and fighting. it's just your typical action flick, nothing spectacular. It's worth seeing at least once, but just know it's nothing like the first one. Much more blood/gore."
4,Summer action fun,"If you're looking for a movie that will a)change your life b)move you c)challenge your artistic senses, don't get this one. If you're looking for something that's designed purely for fun, here's your summer action flick ticket. It has beautiful people, stunning visuals, and lots of action. Cruise is just as fun as always. Thandie Newton is beautiful and talented. If you've seen Ever After, it's a trip to see Dougray Scott as the quite wicked villian. And I just adore Ving Rhames - my only problem with this movie is that he wasn't on screen enough! As for the plot? Who cares! The world was threatened and a dedicated team of adventurers came to the rescue. And they did it with flash and style.When I'm looking for plot and art I look for something along the lines of Shakespeare in Love. When I'm looking for thoughtless fun, I look for Mission Impossible."
3,"Cool scenes, but not much plot","If you want to see some pretty fun car and motorcycle stunts and some other pretty good special effects, this movie is fine. The plot is fairly easily followed and very predictable, but the ending does have an interesting surprise -- the way Cruise gets out of trouble. If you haven't seen the movie, go rent the DVD at Blockbuster -- it isn't worth buying. If you've seen it, you know whether to buy the DVD here."
2,MI2=poor film,"After enjoying Mission Impossible I was really looking forward to the sequel, but it was a major dissapointment. The plot is absolutley horrible. The only time I was impressed by this film was in the action schenes, still they were totally unbelivable. I was expacting for this movie to be a action thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat, but in turn it was a poorly scrpted bomb that did not impress me at all. I do not recommend this movie to any one, if you want to see it go to your local video rental store, it is not worth buing a movie in which you will only want to see once. I'm sorry for my very negative response, but this is how I feel about this movie."
1,They forgot to add a plot,It's amazing how a good concept can turn out so ugly in this movie. After watching the movie I looked to my wife to ask her a question but she was already asleep. Why would you spend so much on special effects and make a movie that plot wise would compare to Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure only worse.
2,"Amusing, but it gets wearing...","It begins well enough, I guess. We seem to be in for a re-make of Hitchcock's Notorious. Cruise needs to recruit a female thief to aid him in his latest impossible mission, and finds himself falling for her. And anyone can see why: she's beautiful, sexy, and a full and interesting person in her own right. Unfortunately, that doesn't last long, and she just turns into a plot device...I must also say that I am getting tired of the John Woo never-ending action sequence chase, in which people do incredible forward aerial triple flips while delivering punishing slow motion kicks, and still manage to land in just exactly so that their hair falls exactly into place."
2,Biggest joke of the new Millinium,"There are allot of horrible movies out there but this is the Worst Big Budget movie of the year. First Eyes Wide Shut and now this. Maybe because it was suppose to be serious and people were laughing in the theatre during parts they shouldnt be . I used to watch the TV show. This was nothing like that. It only took the name. The old show was about ""A Group of agents who defeated the bad guys. They did it slyly and at the end you were sitting there stunned. During this movie, I sat there Bored. I love action scenes but these were moronic. Hollywood at it's worse. If Thandie Lewis has a career after this, nothing will surprise me although Denise Richards keeps getting movie rolls so.... Avoid this and go rent a good action movie like T2 or Gladiator where is actually character development and not just images thrown at you to make money."
4,Scary but good,"It was acctually great! But a little scary for kids at lease untill their 10. Their was one kinda scary part... It was called ""Don't turn around"" But only about 20 seconds of it. Its in the end of it thought but just remember the qoute of the movie in that secene ""Whatever he's looking at he doesn't like it."" But the rest is ok enough for kids."
4,I like having the set.,"Above average remake, driven by special effects. For me, this is quite different from the TV series which was so enjoyable for its twists, and last second resolutions. Still, these movies do deliver good entertainment."
4,Action baby!,"To me, this is the best M:IP movie. Great action and the story is great too. John Woo directed this so of course the action is very stylistic and cool. I think people will and have enjoyed this film"
2,Slow Motion Movie,"It seems like 95 percent of the movie is in slow motion. Every so-called action scene is slowed down to a crawl. When the action scenes are slower than the parts where people are just standing around talking, you know it's a bad movie. The behind the scenes action footage of M:I-2 was much better because it was at normal speed. If you hate slow motion, avoid this DVD."
1,this movie was a piece of crap,"this movie was horrible. it had nothing to do with the mission: impossible series, let alone any plot or any substance. it was basically a Hong Kong-styled action rolling picture tacked on with a good title. it was messed up, and a perversion of movie action, with ridiculous moves and fight scenes. what a waste. perhaps the director should resort to doing short-segemnt action commercials."
3,It sucked,I am literally insulted by the stupididty of this movie..Ok so the mask thing worked ONCE in the first MI But Three times in the second?! give me a break..
3,"Not perfect, but still entertaining.","This movie is definately different from the first. This movie has a lot of hard-core John Woo action at the expense of the stelth spy games and gadgets, which is what Mission Impossible is really about. The movie starts off very slow and then supercharges for the climax. Some of the action is so over-the-top it gets ridiculous. Normally director John Woo is good at this, but enough with the pigeons all ready! Some shots are devoted to just pigeons, an attempt to be over symbolic. Still, John Woo fans will once again like his style here.Basically if you like John Woo films, watch this, but don't expect it to be true ""Mission Impossible."" If you own a DVD player, this DVD has a good ammount of features and it would show off your home audio.Reccomended for John Woo fans."
1,Waste of time and money,"Last night I had a terrible experience of watching this movie. It is a real waste of time and money (it was fortunate that I was presented the cassette). Actually, this shame must be rated zero, but music is nice and 1 is a fair rating for it. Everything is not interesting at all. Visual effects, fights and races are poor; the plot is more than ordinary and it is terribly realized. Acting is awful if it is possible to speak about acting in this movie. I would rather prefer seeing a good Quake-player (or some other gamer) playing instead of entertainment of this type. Woo is not himself - if he goes that way he'd better change his name for Woe."
1,Plot is ripoff of Hitchcock's Notorious,"Am I the ONLY person who noticed the similarity in plots between this movie and Hitchcock's Notorious?! It's basically a remake. Why didn't any of the critics notice this? Save your money and buy that flick instead. I'm still underwhelmed by John Woo's direction. And that stupid motorcycle jousting scene at the end, PLEASE!"
2,"Does the word ""lame"" come to mind?","This has got to be one of the most overhyped films I have ever seen in my 14 years on this Earth. The story was idiotic, the acting was SOOOO lame, and it all made no sense. The fighting scenes didn't even make any sense! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the action is a little cool at times. But what it all boils down to is that this is a stupid movie. A lame, illogical, overhyped movie that requires no mental effort. Thank you."
2,The first movie was MUCH better,"As others have mentioned, there was no Mission Impossible Team, except for Ving Rhames, and Anthony Hopkins, the boss, (Interesting, we got to see the face that goes with the voice on the tape that introduces the case.)I thought the worst was the agonizing slow motion flips and kicks (often while shooting a gun in midair, upside down)."
1,WHAT WENT WRONG ???!!!,"I just would like to know why Cruise transformed a great character ( Ethan Hunt ) into a silly so-called ""action-hero"" ? Why they destroyed the almost perfect chemistry developed between characters in the first movie, and changed this MI 2 into a ludicrous production, full of cliches, action sequences that lead you nowhere ??? I think, from the first scene with Hunt ( the one in which he's climbing mountain with bare hands ) the producers warn you: "" DON'T expect nothing worthwhile here. Don't try to see possible things heres. Just be prepared for journey of impossible deeds, lousy acting and a new ""action-hero"" that's marked to last just this movie."" What a waste of a time."
3,this is a great action flick,"the fight scenes, car chases, special effects and action in this movie are top notch. the plot, like most 007 films, is irrelevant and pretty much non-existent. unlike MI1, this plot is barely noticeable but you really don't care because the directing and effects are super-duper. if you enjoyed Matrix, then you should find this to be entertaining.""my one regret in life was that i was never a banker"""
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ... !!,"I can't believe Cruise helped to produce this crap. Maybe director John Woo's fame is so big that every actor wants to make an action movie with him. But the result in this ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH 2 "" was disgraceful. The movie is worst than the first one ( a classic case of a bad sequence ), it's totally commercially driven, heartless, the action sequences in slow-motion are cliched and boring, the plot is ludicrous. All in all, one of the worst films ever featuring Tom Cruise."
3,"MI:2, my class review-ty","mission impossible 2 is like the first, full of baffling twists, action packed scenes, hanging from cables, chicks, and most of all, masks. overall i think that mission impossible 1 is better because it is less predictable. however, 2 has better action thanks to the genius of John Woo. all of the action scenes are crisp and believeable except when in the motorcycle chase their tires change from street to dirt. i recomend this movie if you are bored.-tyler (how's this wyborney?)"
3,A disappointing sequel.,"I found the story in this one fair more involving than the story in the first Mission: Impossible movie. I really wanted to feel for the sacrifices that the two main characters made for the sake of the ""mission"". However, I found the rapid-fire, almost music video-style direction distracting to the point that the story was often lost (as was my attention to the movie). Based on other reviews, I had expected more. Although I know that most reviewers disgree with me on this, I find the first film effort a more watchable choice. Perhaps upon a repeat viewing, I might come to like this one more than I do."
1,If you like really stupid movies buy M:I2.,"One of the worst movies I've seen this year, weak script, weak story, stupid camera angles, about 500billion close-ups, the climbing scene wasn't nothing spectacular, only the little motorcycle chase at the end was a bit entertaining but the rest of the movie pure junk. It had a budget of 125 Million dollars! Where did the money go? And this is the #1 movie of 2000 and has grossed over 500M worldwide! What world is this!"
1,Why can't we select 0 stars?,If this movie sucked any worse we would all be in trouble because the low pressure caused by such suckiness would create a black hole destroying all life on this planet. Matter of fact if it destroyed all copies of this movie it might be worth it if the planet was swallowed whole by a quantum singularity.
2,Don't shoot the messenger,"Tom Cruise as an actor is simply a messenger. As a producer, he is creating the message along with the director and screenwriter. And the message conveyed, the messengers appear 2-dimensional, and in Cruise's case, certainly not wanting to cheer for.One reason for this is Woo's style. It's weird that bullets never ran out in Hard Boiled and it managed to be quite delirious and original. One can sense the angst and uncertainty of early 1990's Hong Kong where its citizens seemed to ignore the looming imminence of the Chinese takeover of the city.Yet when Cruise's character almost never gets a scratch, he seems too cocky. Too smooth, and therefore nothing we can latch on to identify and feel for the hero. I found the toys in Toy Story/Toy Story 2 more charming and believable. They seem better ""actors"" than Cruise can ever be in this forgettable movie (only this -- he is a great actor in his other films)."
2,James Hunt or Ethan Bond?,"Somebody should have told Tom Cruise and John Woo.....the James Bond franchise is already taken. That's what this installment looks and feels like, no question. Vastly inferior to the first MI film, this popcorn movie does little to compliment the Mission: Impossible mystique. Instead we get John Woo's tired slo-mo action sequences, a ludicrous storyline and Cruise walking through the movie knowing it's critic-proof. Sure, the action stuff is fun, but I expect more out of Mission: Impossible. I expect my brain to get a workout. Not so, here. Predictable at every turn. And not a subtle frame to be found. This is a John Woo film (Brian DePalma was accused of ""facelessly"" directing the first film....EXACTLY; as this one should have been!). Woo's fingerprints are all over this thing. It's excessive to the max. Waste your money on this turkey if you must."
4,Ethan and Nyah are perfect together!,"I loved the chemistry between Ethan and Nyah. The action was still there but now they gave him a love interest who was not a colleague but was just as clever and unique as he is. Using the biological weapon as the national threat was credible and on target with today's problems. Add the spectacular opening shot with Ethan rock climbing and add a setting as gorgeous as Sydney, Australia and what can I say ""Wow""!!! If you love motorcycles this will also pique your interest in the film. Women get the romance, men the blood and guts, or vice versa,and everyone comes away from the movie content and feeling that everything turned out the way it should."
3,A bit of mindless fun,"Yes, you have to put your brain on hold and suspend your disbelief higher than the cliff Cruise's character dangles from but if you want a movie purely for stunts, you will probably enjoy this one. The plot may be tired and thread-bare but the movie is a nice filler when you don't want a deep movie but one that just carries you along for a fun ride. Yes, it's loaded with a bunch of cliche-type elements and characters but some of the stunts truly were exciting and innovative -- even if many of them stretched belief way past the breaking point. If you want a movie with character depth, heart, unique stuntwork and kick-butt fighting sequences watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If you want testosterone-laden stunts without the bother of needing your brain, this one may just fit the bill."
1,BAD-very unreal,"This movie i hated for a few reasons A)There was a very little plot, just stuff blowing up B)There are a few VERY unreal scenes one being(you might have seen it in the perveiws) where tom cruise and his enemy drive as fast as they can at one another and jump and hit each other...YOU WOULD EXPLODE LIKE A RIPE MELON and other various things of which no normal person would serviveRating-i give it a one because in my opinion a movie is not mad up of explosions and cool vehicles and doodads, its the plot that matters...it you disagree, give it 5 stars"
2,"Bad movie, just plain bad","I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1, because I am assuming when I fell asleep wathcing this in the movie theater that I missed something incredible. I would not reccommend this movie to anyone, maybe if it is on HBO and you are flipping through the channels and have nothing else to do, you could watch maybe 25 minutes of it, before getting upset and turning it. It is hard to beleive how bad movies can be, and still make so much money. I wonder when people are going to help each other out and tell them not to waste their money on certain movies like this.D"
1,Horrible Movie,This is nothing like the first mission impossible which had a great story line and a great mystery behind it. This one is weak and all of a sudden Ethan Hunt becomes an action hero. What is that all about the first one is espionage this one is loaded action most of it not possible. Too fake of a movie. If you liked the way the first one was made like i did don't watch this but if you like watching a movie of just stunts and one you don't have to think hard in go ahead. Terrible.
2,The movie what is concentrated on effects,"MI-2 is fo sure much worse that MI-1. The two series of MI are so different that the only thing what is common there is a character of Ethan Hunt. While MI-1 has a strong scenario, MI2 is so weak in the idea that sometimes you feel that this movie has nothing to say and the only thing what makes this movie strong is its special effects and beautiful sceneries. It seems that the producers had to fill up the time in the movie and therefore put in a terribly long and nonsence scenes like the opening sequences and also scenes in Sevilla. I even do not understand why was so lot of music behind needed. Sometimes it seemed that the film looked like a big commercial of the high level cinema techniques of the millenium. But anyway, if you enjoy good visual and sound effects, you have to see it."
2,Vapid & Insipid,"They should have named this movie ""Matrix Wannabe"". This is everything that is bad about Hollywood summer action films. The action sequences were beyond ridiculous. This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall repeatedly. I found this movie only slightly less annoying than cleaning my cat's litterbox. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it is visually entertaining."
2,boring,"i am disappointed in paramount for allowing the MI series to go in this direction, the James Bond direction. are they just trying to woo (no pun intended) the james bond crowd?they have taken the central idea in MI and made it into a one man show. the original series was a TEAM effort, and the first movie still had a team effort, even though the team was decimated at the beginning. also, the tv show tested your brain capacity somewhat, which the first MI succeeded very well--how many had to see it three times in order to get what the hell just happened--but this one was so straight forward, it was boring.simply put, it was boring. don't buy it."
1,"All flash, no bang","While the action sequences were very good, the plot and script left a lot to be desired. Even with the glitzy action the movie had me yawning at the half way mark. The plot in this movie and it's predecessor lack the style and subtilty of the original TV series. If there was ever a question as to whether this was simply a Tom Cruise vehicle your suspicions are confirmed at the end of the film with the ""Making Of..."" interviews.Your time would be better spent watching one of the old Bond films than wasting a single moment with this turkey."
1,Worse than the first.,"Just when you thought Tom Cruise might make a decent movie after the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" debacle. Well, it didn't happen. If your into guns, guns, guns, and more guns and unrealistic disguises, then this movie might be good enough for you. This movie has the age old plot of the bad guy wants lots of $$ and destroy the world in the process. The only cool part of the movie has to deal with the motorcycle chase, in which are totally impossible to do some of these tricks. Personally this movie is not worth the cost to make the actual dvd."
2,Inferior to both the first and third in this series,"Although not entirely without merit, this just did not meet my expectations from the first MI with Cruise. Interestingly, MI-3 is the best of the three movies and I would give it a 3.5 - 4.0 rating."
2,Script needed a rewrite- Worst of the 4 movies 1 and 3 were the best,"Script needed a rewrite! Worst of the 4 movies 1 and 3 were the best, and number 4 was good but not has dark as 1 and 3 were. This movie was far worse than expected- the script needed a huge rewrite- a few things were off in the movie, does not seem to flow well and seems choppy in regards to the unfolding of the story."
3,movie rating,i only got to see part of it as they removed it from my kindle fire before i got to finish it.
3,"Good storyline, ridiculously over the top stuntwork","While I enjoyed the story line, the stunt work was so ridiculously over the top and unrealistic that it ruined the movie for me."
2,Does not deliver,"The original Mission Impossible stories used to take one, or on a special occasion, two episodes for special occasions, to tell their story. Dated they may be, but they are streets ahead of this disappointing sequel to the revival that seems to drag out a flimsy story into over two hours. It takes 40 minutes for the story to start properly, and then when it does there is way too much invested in lovey-dovey nonsense. This isn't supposed to be a love story; it's supposed to be an action flick and as such needs to move fast. A few fancy effects yes, but who can't do this there days in movies. Does not deliver."
4,The Truth,"In a world full of people with nothing better to do than bad mouth a movie that, in the first place they could never make themselves, i have but one thing to say "" If you haven't tried making or acting in a movie, don't comment on the people who can"" MI2 is much better than the first at least Cruise does seem human in the movie, he does bleed and get hurt(not like james bond movies were bond always seems to beat rivals bigger and stronger than him)Don't get me wrong bond movies have there place just like x-men, the perfect storm, star wars... Compare apples with apples, oranges with oranges...MI2 has great action scenes and a believable love story(love at first site). Just remember it's make believe, sit down, relax and enjoy."
3,Just does not keep in the MI tradition,"The problem is that this is a John Woo film. The action scenes are brilliant and fun. The shots are just right, the action fast-paced and truly a fun experience. So, perhaps one would think I would give it a good rating?The problem is that I came out feeling pretty good about the movie - THEN I thought a bit more about it. Then I also saw Mission Impossible (the first one) which I had not seen and I realized that the wool was pulled over our collective heads. This was not a true MI movie! This was a John Woo film. And maybe if it was something else, like Face Off 2, I'd give it greater consideration. But it simply did not follow the feel (dare I say, zeitgeist?) of MI. This movie was trying to be cool, hip, action packed and fun. But it lacked substance in favour of form.And....just how many times do they have to use that mask thing? It was a BIG cop out and went over the ""suspension of disbelief"" line."
3,A lot different from the first...,"...this comes from having very different director's styles.John Woo with his all-action blow them up, shoot 'em up scenes verses the first MI movie which was very much like the TV series. If you want to see some spectacular, mind-boggling stunts then this is the movie for you. I was also curious to see how this film showcased Sydney - the city where I live. In fact a lot of the movie was filmed around the building where I work. Weird seeing such familiar surroundings in a blockbuster movie.This is one to see first on the big screen and then one to relive over and over on the small one...."
2,Another bad transfer. Not exactly an HD telecine film,"I bought many Blurays although I already own DVD titles before only because I wanted to upgrade into High Def. Some of them are quite satisfying in terms of video quality as well as audio quality.This one is one of the total failure. Video quality is the same as DVD, MPEG-2. There are a really few bluday titles released in MPEG-2 that have good quality. This isn't.Audio does not have HD sound because it was released early.Now I don't even know why I bought this title.Above all, I think I have waste my money on this. The thing is I don't even wanna keep it."
1,Not worth it,"In the first Mission Impossible, Ethan Hunt was an ordinary spy caught in an extraordinary situation and was able to come out on top. This movie's Ethan Hunt is an adrenaline junkie who is suddenly 'the man'I can suspend disbelief for the sake of a story, but even I have to draw the line somewhere.If you like John Woo, then you will most likely enjoy this movie (criticism's of Tom Cruise notwithstanding..)If you enjoyed the character premise of the first movie (that was brought back a bit in the third..), then you will not like this movieThe latter is where I fall and sadly this movie just doesn't hold its own."
3,was disappointed,"came in less than 3 days, was in the condition the seller said it was in. All 3 of these were great movies the 1st time I saw them, but after buying them I gave too my ex wife, she likes T. Cruise"
5,this movie rules,"this movie is really awesome! i really don't care about what other people say cause this movie was really good. I thought it had really good elements. although any MI sequel could never beat the first one, this one came in for a close second. i really dont give a care about wat these stupid film critics say cause they're prob paid to say things about movie in which the people that pay them dont like or dont like the actor starring in it. so screw the critics and the people that thought this movie sucked cuz guess what IT DIDN""T SUCK!"
1,What were they thinking?,"I don't know why you would give this a thumbs up. I thought this had to have been one of the worst movies I've seen at a theater. I was ready to walk out towards the end. Sure, some movies you have to take it at face value for unbelievable action sequences, but since when did Tom Cruise become Bruce Lee? The MI series revolved around all the characters and not just one man. In here, Ethan Hunt is James Bond and Ving Rhames becomes a two scene side-kick doing whatever James Bond wants. The story was the same old recycled stuff, why not develop that more on the terrorists, etc.The last fight scene and chase were so unbelievable and long (felt like an eternity, especially the bike scene....year right, drive on your shoes off the bike?), I was half out of my seat towards the door, but my girlfriend wanted to see the ending. If you want to spend $20, spend it on Gladiator or the Patriot because this will just gather dust in your collection."
1,Total waste of time.,"Worst acting in years, worst attempt at a story, can't even compare to the worst Bond movie. I'll bet this is the first ""action movie"" that many people dozed off in."
1,John Wooendit,"There is over the top and then there's MI 2. Every moment was unbelievable. Stick with MI 1&3, Still over the top but way more realistic. Que the F@#*ing doves."
1,Worse than the 1st?,"I think it's quite possible that it was.Seriously,Tom Cruise sucks and he proved it once again with this piece of garbage.Thinking about buying this,don't waste your money."
3,Another one who tryed to copie James Bond!!,All i can say about this movie is Copy-Cat.Compared to the first Mission Impossible we no longer see intresting Tactical Operations or inteligent deductions.No! To make more money they create another james bond who alone with his Pistol takes down a whole armada.Whats Great!- Special Effects- Music- ActorsWhats Cheap!-Story-One man army james bond styleWell rent it if your at home stuck because of a bad rainy day!
2,another sequel.......,"You see, when a film like MI 1 comes out u expect a decent sequel, but, unfortunatly u never get one. The plot is very familiar to any one who knows Syphon Filter on PS 1. Special agent Eathen Hunt has to stop Dugarry Scotts villan who threatens to release a deadly disease. Cruise acts the hardman but hes no Connery and Thandie newton is no.. I must be dreaming.... yes i was after watching this.."
3,What was that bike stuff???,"I bought it 'cuz I watched it in the theater and I though it is a cool movie. But as I watch repeatedly, I started to get tired of it because of the long bike-racing and fighting scene at the end of the movie. (I think first and middle part of the movie is pretty good...)If it is'nt ""Mission Impossible 2"", it's acceptable. But I felt these scences spoiled the theme of Mission Impossible.If you really like the original one, I don't recommend U to buy this stuff."
3,Entertaining,"Great effects and fight sequences, but a silly and unbelievable plot. Tom Cruise was cool and he had great chemistry with Thandie Newton. I was even more impressed after watching the making of 'MI2'. WOW, they put DAYS into some small scenes just to get perfect effects. I was also shocked that TOM CRUISE did almost all of his own stunts, which are VERY dangerous (walking through fire, having a knife a half-inch from his eye, falling from the top of a very high platform and landing four inches from the camera, doing risky motorcycle stunts, etc). I must admit that I disliked this movie the first time I saw it, but after seeing it again, I actually liked it! ALMOST 4 STARS"
3,It wasn't MI:1... thankfully.,"Very good Mission Impossible movie. Lot's of action, plot, machismo(I've always wanted to use that word in a review). If you're looking for a movie with lot's of explosions, and very good angles, Woo is the man to deliver. If you are looking for a tear jerker, or something with substance, it won't be here. Not that is a bad thing, as movies are supposed to entertain. And this one pays up."
4,Good Action Film,"Action fans will not be disappointed by MI2. John Woo, director of the John Travolta/Nichols Cage film Face/Off, has done some visually stunning action scenes in MI2. The plot is simple, but action is the keynote of this movie. The only problem with the film is Tom Cruise - he is just not an action star. Note for film buffs: the plot of this film is a techno update of Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious. Tom Cruise & Thandie Newton take on the roles played by Cary Grant & Ingrid Bergman, while Dougray Scott does the Claude Rains part. Scott's relationship with his head bodyguard is similar to James Mason & Martin Landau in North By Northwest. And the producers claim MI2 is an original screenplay!"
2,Why must they ruin everything???,"It was nave of me to think that maybe, just maybe, they'd include the Japanese language track and 'not' Americanize the characters in this video game like they did in the series. One Piece is quite simply my favorite anime of all time but the American TV version is mindless garbage with little or no plot and abysmal voice acting that has zero resemblence to the fantastic series from Japan. I will do everything in my power to play the Japanese version of this game somehow, some way..."
1,Very disappointing and biased,"I read this book four years ago in preparation for a graduate history seminar. It was so poorly researched and filled with over-wrought prose that I told the class as a work of history it was near worthless. The pro-Southern, Lost Cause mentality of the author taints every statement. The book was written back in the 1920s and it shows. The topic is a fascinating one and a new, well-researched, and balanced account of the last privateers would be welcome by scholars and history buffs. This book is a waste of time and money."
5,Can You Say Taboo??,"Talk about a hush hush topic. Black men having sex with other men on the DL. Now this is not the kind of book I go around reading, but after I was treated to an excerpt I was truly captivated by this forbidden subject matter. This author needs more exposure because this book is well written and is developed quite well. The story is about Trent Mathews. By all signs, he has got it going on completely. Nice career, decent looking woman by his side, church going, but he secretly lusts after men. He really loves men, the way they look and how they can please him. I am not exageratting, this book is so naughty you won't want people to see you reading it and the author hit a definite home run. This book reads so real and it doesn't seem like anything capitalizing off of the recent DL trend. Check out this naughty book and don't let anyone see you reading it!"
3,My first question is...,"This book is pretty much a dramatization based on the ideas discussed in the book ""On The Down Low"", by J. L. King. The subtitle is misleading as one may infer that it offers more information on the DL ""phenomenon"", but is really IS another urban fiction book. That said, it is expectedly sexually explicit and somewhat sensationalist. The characterization is somewhat flat at times, but it's entertaining if that is what you are looking for. The writer writes TS/TV fiction under a pseudonym, so one may be interested in looking them up."
2,Fiction,"Down Low Secrets ""piggy backed"" off the success of J.L King's, On the Down Low. It seems to me that Ames took King's accounts and fictionalized it into a story about men who sleep with other men, while they appear to be hetrosexual.Some passages of the book are sexually graphic.There's nothing great, outstanding about this book."
1,Worst CD I have heard for years,"I like Plaid, but if anyone would charge me a $ for this double-CD I would be offended. I only found disharmony and tunes without soul on both of the CD's. Plaid is not evolving anymore, this is a major setback."
3,Useful USMLE Prep,"This book has been helpful in my USMLE preparation due to the case-based format, high yield emphasis, and the anatomical pearls. However, this book was poorly edited -- there are numerous errors in the text, mislabelled diagrams, etc. If you plan to use this book, have an anatomy atlas at your side, so that you can have a second source for accuracy."
3,Too small figures in Kindle version,"I like the paperback version of this book,Case Files: Gross Anatomy, 2nd Edition, but the Kindle version has a flaw -- some of the figures are too small, or low-res, so it is hard to see details and texts in such figures."
4,It's Abridged!,"I don't know how I missed this fact since as I now look at the description I see it mentioned twice, but this is an abridged version. I'm giving it a try since I bought it and opened it, but I always try to buy unabridged.I have finished disc one and am enjoying it so far. Elizabeth McGovern does a very good job with the voices and accents: mens's, women's, American and British. There is not much classical music, just a few short passages, but they add to the ambiance of the narration."
5,Great Seamless,Very good price in comparison to stores and great seamless. I always get my seamless paper from Adorama. I rather have it shipped than carry it with me. Very well packaged. Would shop from this vendor again.
2,Just another Jekyll & Hyde.,"Why she called it ""Vile Acts"" is beyond me. This is your standard fare vampire-type serial killer with a little ""Jekyll and Hyde"" thrown in. Apologies to Anne Rice, but hasn't this genre been about pounded to death? (Maybe not: people keep buying carbon copy serial killer novels.) Now get this: one's a vampire but the others are kind of ok because there were TWO formulas! (Give me a break!) Dorothy McMillan wrote a great dark and macabre novel titled ""Blackbird."" It is hard to believe this grade ""B"" junker was written by the same author."
5,consumer,"Simply the best there is , nothing compares to this , it has everything you could expect.I've investigated and searhed for a new tv. Until I saw this it passed with flying colors,the picture , sound ,sharpness, etc.. look for yourself and compare and you judge . Thank You ! Toshiba !"
5,Awsome TV,"This was not the lowest priced 16:9 TV on the Internet...BUT, if you want stellar service you buy from Amazon. The picture is awsome, couple it with a nice progressive scan DVD player and you are walking in high cotten. This is living!"
3,Bubba lives,"It is difficult to give a real rating for this book as I am still waiting for my first edition signed hardback. However, I have had the privledge of eating ice cream with Elbert and reading some of his rough drafts I know the book will give me lots of entertainment. In the meantime I'm watching the most fascinating birds in the lagoon here on Ambergris Caye and shopping for a good bird identification book. I can tell you the one titled Birds of Guatumaula & Belize is absolutely useless. Miss Harriette"
4,you want more LSF,"An effective prelude to the singles collection ""Inches."" ""IC Timer"" manages to anticipate ""Meet Me In The Dollar Bin"" while sounding nothing at all like it."
5,Sibling Rivalry,Hilarious storyline with Kristie Ally at her best with Sam Elliot. Couldn't stop laughing. Recommend this comedy for teens up.
4,THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY,I thought this was really funny. I love Kirstie ALley's acting and she was really good in this movie.I ordered it because someone told me about it.Bill Pullman was good in it too.
4,A funny little Movie,"This movie has some scenes in it that make you laugh until you cry. Kirsty Alley's character who is a bored wife of a Doctor has a crazy fling with Sam Elliott's character. She thinks it's a one night stand until she finds out he is her husband's brother returning to the US after being away for years. When her brother-in-law dies of a heart attack in the motel room, the movie takes off as Bill Pullman a nerdy blind salesman tries to help her make it look like her brother-in-law committed suicide. Carrie Fisher plays a snotty Sister-in-law. A Great cast and a funny movie."
1,A Disappointing Tutorial,"I've used many different CAD systems for over twenty years. And, now I'm learning Pro E. This book is very disappointing for several reasons. First of all, the instructions for each example are not complete and very difficult to follow. And, there are very few pictures of the command menus. Worst of all, the parameters of each command are not well explained as to how they relate to each part example. And, it has no Index. So, it is difficult to use as a reference. I've decided not to continue using this book and to look for something else that is less frustrating to use. If any of you know a really good Pro E tutorial, please let me know..."
1,I got a lemon!,I bought this TV in February and have had a repair person come to my house 5 times already and they have yet to fix the problem. The TV does not show the color blue so the sky and everything that should be blue is green and anything that should be white is yellow. Last week they replaced the picture tube and it still did not fix the problem. My TV is getting new parts one at a time service call by service call and none of it have fixed the problem. Each new part has to be ordered and that always takes a few weeks. It is covered under the warranty but who cares because I have looked at a horrible picture for the last 6 months. I just want a new TV!
4,"Very Catchy, and Surprising Divas fill this Bubbly CD!","I bought this cd mainly because of Miss Kim Criswell, the DIVA. But let me tell you I was blown away by the rest of the cast, mainly Diane J. Findlay, and Walter Willison.Ofcourse Miss Criswell delights with her gorgeous soprano and dazzles with her brassy belt, as always. Kim does well in her solos, belty, particularly in ""Man At the Piano,"" and ""Give A Girl A Break."" But the major shock was how DIVA Miss Diane J. Findlay was! She knows how to work when she sings ""Nobody Needs A Man A Bad As That!"" and her wonderful acting/belty solo ""Better Bein' Loved is a amazing! Also Walter Wilson belting ""Good Ol Mammy Song!"" and ""Mazzie.""This Cd is filled with hidden gems! A great, catchy cd! Highly recommended for Musical Theatre lovers looking to try something new, or interested in Belty Divas. This is for u!"
5,Great Camera,I am not a professional. I take pictures for my work. Upload to the web. E-mail pictures and video. This camera makes everything easy. The quality is incredible. I am still learning how to use the features. My brother took some pictures printed out 8 1/2 X 11 and put them in frames. They look professional.I would recommend this camera as this camera was recommended to me.
5,Great camera,"This is a replacement for another Sony DSC-F828 camera that I have. It is very useful, it records voice notes wonderfully. I am happy to have found another one."
4,THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA,"I BOUGHT THE SONY DSCF707 AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE. I BOUGHT THE DSCF828 TO UPGRADE TO A 8 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA. THE 828 IS A GREAT CAMERA. IT HAS NOT FAILED ME ONCE. IT HAS MANY GOOD FEATURES AND ONE OF THOSE IS THE 28-200 LENS. I REALLY LIKE HAVING A WIDER ANGLE LENS FOR TAKING PICTURES IN CRAMPED SPACES. THE OTHER IS THE CAPABILITY TO TAKE PHOTOS AT ISO 64. I LEAVE THE CAMERA AT THIS SETTING AND ADJUST THE EV TO GET THE LIGHT I NEED TO TAKE A GOOD PHOTO. I HAVE TAKEN NATURE, PORTRAIT, AND FAMILY PICTURES WITH THIS CAMERA AND THE PHOTOS SHOW DEEP RICH COLORS WITH FINE GRAIN. THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT GIVE IT 5 STARS IS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE AUTO ZOOM. I HAVE HAD NO PURPLE FRINGING. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SHOOT INTO THE SUN YOU WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PURPLE FRINGING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY, YOU'LL BE PLEASED."
1,Too Much,"One of the reasons why you will buy a camera is Value for Money... clearly, with its hefty price tag, this is not value for money. Yes, this model may be a good camera but why pay almost $1000 for this?"
1,$1000 for this?,"This would've been a good camera (not great but good), but paying $1000 for this? Ha! Its not even a real SLR.... too costly."
2,"Replace my DSC-F707. Not yet, maybe later.",I was going to replace my 707 secondary camera with the 828 but after taking side by side identical pictures with both cameras I have decided against the 828. The build of the camera and picture detail is nice but the purple fringing is horrible and unforgivable and leaves me very discouraged. I read the reviews in DPreview.com and thought I would give it a chance but it's not going to work for me. I returned the Sony and will keep the 707 as my secondary and Digital Rebel as my primary.
2,Too much money for too little,"While 8MP sounds great, this camera has too many problems to make it competitive with other cameras in this price range. For $999, you can get the 6.3MP Canon Digital Rebel which has far superior image quality and considerably less noise per picture, AND is compatible with all of Canon's EF lenses. I recomend looking at sites such as dpreview.com and look at the test images generated. For a slight reduction in picture size, you can get vastly better quality with the similarly priced Canon and Nikon Digital SLR cameras. And get more features to boot."
1,A big disappointment,"This camera was such a big disappointment, I am so frustrated with it.I have had this camera for over 3 years, and I just hate it. The lens and the sensor size don't allow you to do much.I had the Sony DSC-F717 before the 828. I loved the 717 at the time, but I dropped the 717, and though that I would go with the 828 as an upgrade to the 717.The 828 is not an upgrade at all, sure it has more pixels, but the picture quality is not as good and I have a ton of problems with purple fringing in my photos.I have shot over 10,000 pictures with the 828 and and over 10,000 with the 717. It is my opinion that the 717 was a better camera, even at only 5.1MP than the 828 is at 8MP.One thing that drives me nuts on this camera is the fixed lens. It is an average middle range lens. It doesn't do wide angle, and it doesn't really zoom, so its not much good.Don;t waste your money on the 828, especially today where there are so many other better cameras out there. Go with a Digital SLR."
1,Purple People Eaters!,"Perhaps Sony made this camera specifically for Prince. I'm not sure who else would enjoy having all this purple added to nearly every single picture. It's terrible that for 1000 bucks, you have ot put up with this shoddy performance. Folks, 8 megapixels don't mean a darned thing when the implementation is this horrible. I returned mine and I used the money on a Digital Rebel and a Sigma 75-300 mm lens for the same price. I get much better pictures, and I can use the lenses I buy on future cameras I buy. Good riddance, Sony. Now apparently your cameras are as bad as your customer support has always been."
5,Excellent product,This a fantastic equipment for those who love serius photography. I recomend this products 100%
2,"Noisy Noisy Noisy, very dissapointed in image quality","This Cam was huge let down,Noisy Noisy Noisy, very dissapointed in image quality:http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydscf828/page14.aspJust look up this cam and you will find the info about its noise factor. The optical chip set is from 2003 technology and it shows.I spent hours fixing the images from my trip to the southwest. Forget capturing green, btw.This Cam has many options but what pro would want to fool with them when the Cam itself introdces tons of noise.When First getting this Cam and after seeing the dissapointing results of most of the the photos I took I descided to see if it was my lack of pro experience that my picts where noisy. I mean I've talken picts for years for great results with a decade older cam, so I was expecting really nice picts from this, this was not case.Read up on this one before you spend 700$ on 2003 technology."
1,There are real problems with CA and purple fringing!,These problems just ruin the camera. Some owners may deny it because of their personal ego investment - but it is much worse than my Canon 4MP. To some extent it exist in other cameras but it is terrible in this one. Wish they had done better.
2,"Overpriced, overhyped crap - Give me the Fuji S7000 any day!","I purchased a Sony DSC-F828 as a second camera. Here's what I found:Horrible at action shots.Picture quality is abysmal when going above a 4"" x 6"" in size.Lots of noise at most any speed.Easy to get your money back on eBay because everyone seems to want this technological piece-o-crap.For the money, the Fuji S7000 is a far superior camera...and I've blown up the 12MP JPEG images on that to 46"" x 52"" without the problem of noise or purple fringe in low light situations AND I've used those pictures for professional art gallery shows in Los Angeles.Sony needs to get their act together in the digital camera realm. This model was rushed to the floor - and I think everyone expected something with far better quality and versatility."
2,Not ready for sale,"For reasons unknown Sony sold this dog before the bugs were worked out. The F828 has several very bad design goofs and as is I wouldn't buy one. And neither should you. Oh, but it looks cool!"
2,Good... but TOO EXPENSIVE!,"This camera is a good one. Ease of use, quality... good blend of form and function. Problem? TOO EXPENSIVE! Why pay a thousand dollar for a single lense camera? Canon and Nikon has their real SLR digital cameras that costs the same, with the lense already! This may be a good camera but let's face it, it is no SLR. If you're willing to spend this much, go for the Canon 300d or Nikon's soon to be released SLR. Sorry Sony Fans! This would have earn more stars if not for its ridiculous price tag."
1,Don't be fooled by the pixel count,"Apparently playing mega pixel gamea and putting flashy stickers on camera body is more important to Sony than image quality. Images from this camera show excessive purple fringing and noise. Don't get me wrong, I like some other aspects of the camera, such as solid built magnesium body, great zoom range (28mm-200mm in 35mm equivilant), dual storage support(CF and Sony priporitary Memeory Stick). However, it comes way short in the most important aspect of a digital camera, IMAGE QUALITY. I rather have clean, well defined 3-5mp images than fuzzy, noisy 8mp images. I don't want to waste my storage space on noises. Thanks and No Thanks to Sony."
1,unconvincing,"I simply was not convinced by this book! very disappointing, especially since i love jean seberg. but her character is ravaged and the prententious prose gets in the way too! a glorious opportunity wasted."
5,The Classic,"This book is the ""Classic"" photo book of Mustang and Lo Monthang. Most of us will never get there (tourism is severely limited, and the hike in is difficult at best) to see it ourselves. This book takes us on a journey to a place that is also a step way back in time (no electricity, phones, etc throughout most of the country). Highly recommended for look at a ""country within a country"" (Mustang is within Nepal), that most don't even know exists."
4,Useful tool,"60-Day food planner. Good tool to briefly record food plan, thoughts and emotions, what went well, alterations to the plan for food, exercise, water, etc. Includes daily scripture to read that complements efforts for spiritual, emotional, relational and physical healing. This food journal is most useful if used in conjunction with Steve Arterburn's ""Lose it For Life"" series, which includes: Textbook (5 stars), Workbook, and Daily Devotion (4.5 stars) Get all four and get ready for change. As it is said, ""You can't do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result."" Be willing to change and the results will come, provided the material is diligently worked through. While I agree with the previous suggestion re: spiral binder, don't wait to get one just because of that. I'm buying an Interactive Journal Planner for a friend today."
2,Shoddy Research!,"The Recovering Catholic would more properly be titled, The Recovering Christian, as many of the reasons for leaving the Catholic Church as given by the women who responded to the author's questionnaire were reasons common to the teachings common to all Christian denominations. In addition, many of the reasons given had to do with disagreeing with doctrines which the respondents believed to be ""Catholic"" but which were, in fact, neither doctrines nor dogmas embraced and/or taught in Catholicism at all! Far too many sentences within this shoddily researched book began with phrases such as ""It is well known that..."" However, the author provided not a shred of evidence to support those openers.Steer clear of this if you are indeed in recovery...from anything!"
4,unknown band,"This reminds me of tesla somewhat,but with there own flare.Pretty coolif you like sleeze.There are some cool guitar in here too.I gave it 4stars cause the production could have been better.But still cool ifyou like this kind of rock."
5,my favorite Norma Fox Mazer book,"Although the paperback caption focuses on whether he can disclose the secret to his new girlfriend, the story is more than a romance. It's a powerful account of the effects a parents' fugitiveness have on a teenager. Pete Greenwood is very loyal to his parents and so will keep their secret; but he is plagued by nightmares (the ""White Terror""), the constant fear of being watched and caught by the FBI, and the pain of being separated from his parents. Mazer has strong vivid characterizations, credible plot, and a moving storyline. The novel has suspense, drama, and romance. Downtown is my favorite Norma Fox Mazer book."
2,Prog brit-pop!,"I have fond memories of seeing Levitation, Slowdive, and Blur (on the same bill!)at the Marquee Club in New York in 1991, during the height of the shoegaze movement. I had Coterie on cassette then and was captivated by the track 'Firefly'. The cassette is long gone so I got my hands on the out of print CD recently to re-live those long past days...and was disappointed. 'Firefly' is still a great track, just as good as 'There's No Other Way', 'Sweetness and Light', or any other standout British tune of the period. But the rest is overlong, wanky self indulgence that has more in common with leaden prog rock than shoegaze. The exception is 'It's Time', a dissonant beaut, but the only real reason to own this is for one track, 'Firefly'."
3,not bad,"Wing ninja's accuracy is nice.If you have a loader, it's rapidfire stat goes up depending onwhether you put on the dhb oneor the big one.(the big one is better!)If you know what shot control is, pleasewrie a review on any bdaman you like.thank you!"
2,UNBALANCED,my friend has this b daman and he let me try it and it sucks.first the foot armour is made of rubber so it has bad balance.the wing grip is kinda heavy so it makes it more unbalanced plus it doesnt give good control. DON'T ADD A LOADER ITS HEAVY AND U NEED TO SUPPORT ALL THE WEIGHT.
3,Flava flavs,"This is a collection of modern bhangra and indian-influenced music, made mostly by British groups.The cd spans a few musical genres, but all with a distinct Indian musical flair attached.Some songs are very hot and catchy while some are just ok. I think a lot of this music could eventually catch on and go more mainstream because the beats are so creative.Overall it's a good overview of a different type of music though. A good way to sample a bunch of quality relatively-unknown artists at a semi-reasonable price. 3.5 stars."
1,Even drunk this wasn't funny...,"Bought this expecting it to be bad in the Ed Wood sense (I could have lived with that) but it's virtually unwatchable. There is nothing redeaming about this film...it makes ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" look like ""Citizen Kane"" and that's saying something. Disregard all these other reviews and stay very, very far away from this utter waste of time."
5,Good CD....BAD price!,Do not buy this CD for $99.00. If you want a new CD buy it for $14.99 on this website. These sellers are trying to rip you off!http://www.lonestarmusic.com/
5,Wonderful Picture,"I have been using this television now for a couple of weeks and I love it. I bought a Toshiba DVD player to go with it, and I would rather be watching them than at the movie theater. The picture is wonderful and it is very easy to set up."
5,YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED,"...I JUST RECEIVED MY TOSHIBA 27A41 27"" FLAT SCREEN T.V...IT IS ONE FINE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. ""YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED""..."
3,Potential for 5 starts but for bad geometry performance,"The first thing that struk me after the TV was delivered was the amazing picture. As soon as I swithed the channel to TV guide, I saw the horizontal and vertical lines were skewed. Thinking that it was my cable that was doing it, I played a DVD: the same problem. I called Toshiba and they said it probably was a defective unit and also asked me to keep the TV away from any external speakers to eliminate magnetic interference. I did and it was still the same. I went back to several stores and saw that the Toshiba was doing it more than any other television (almost all flat screens in the store did this though but to a very lesser extent). I exchanged it with the Panasonic PureFlat Tau series CT-27sx11. Minimal geometry problems with this set but it still doesn't beat the Toshiba in picture quality. The Toshiba would have been a 5 star, if not for the geometry."
1,Bad at Geometry,"And, I'm not talking about high school math.Like some other ""flat screen"" TV's, this model can ""bend"" what should be straight lines in the picture. If you look at this TV in a store, find an image that contains a large box - like an on screen menu - or any image that you know should be square.The model I viewed on display at an electronics store in Chicago bent straight lines inward - along the left side of the screen, and bent straight lines upward toward the top right hand side of the screen.The picture color and clarity are brilliant on this model, but who cares. Once you know the geometry is off it will make you nuts.Did I view a single bad set? Probably not. I read a review of this TV on another website. That author purchased this TV, noted the bad geometry, and had the same issue after replacing it twice. He finally opted for a flat screen set from another manufacturer"
2,"geometry bad, picture good","There is definitely a geometry problem that ruins a really good TV. it's not incredibly noticeable but is definitely there if you look at it.you think flat screen would have straight lines...but that is not the case here.otherwise, the picture and the case are very sleek and nice but skewed lines ruin it."
5,Review.,"Harding's provocative title promises in no uncertain terms to tell a good story. I experienced suspense as the Book of Jerry Falwell carefully delineated an important dimension of the story of America, then, more broadly and intensely, the story of speech, and of listening, making calmly powerful suggestions about the nature of both. With the hint of an irony that is at once intelligent and warm, Harding has written a rare book, a familiar book, about a culture often seen, from the corner of our eyes, in the side-view mirrors of our cars, one much closer than it appears. This author doesn't need to stray from a thorough elucidation of her subject to meditate intently upon larger questions, which is a continual delight. This book augurs well for anthropology in America."
5,Inside Jerry Falwell,"In light of Rev. Falwell's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, I recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand, ""Why would that guy say that stuff?"" Harding presents an objective, intelligent, perceptive analysis of the way that Fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world, and how Jerry Falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active Moral Majority of the 1980s. Harding combs through Falwell's history and sermons to observe how the language of ""being born again"" affects the listener, showing Falwell's shift from separatism to political activism. She critiques both Falwell and Falwell's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way. Good reading and good understanding."
4,american graffiti,"Okay guys here's the deal,I am ( unfortunately ?) old enough to remember what this film looked like during its original theatrical release. It didn't look that much better than this Blu-Ray.I have always loved this period-perfect nostalgia piece & having experienced this era for myself I can attest to its general veracity. I have seen a number of reviews critical of this transfer, but having owned the VHS & DVD versions rest assured that American Graffiti has never looked better. Yes there is slight edge-enhancement if you really look for it & a bit of Black Crush in the darkest scenes & occasional depth-of-field limitations here & there,but the majority,I'm convinced, is due to source limitations.I suppose that a hurculean effort by an entity like Criterion might be able to improve on this transfer,but only marginally.If you love this little gem of a movie like I do, you can buy this with the confidence that it is about as good as this movie is ever likely to look & sound."
2,Great film - Lousy DVD quality,"American Graffiti has always been one of my favorite movies; I have absolutely NO critcism of the film. I would rate the movie itself with 5 stars. But... this review is in regard the extremely poor quality of the DVD. I am purplexed that many say the DVD picture qualtiy is good, because that is my major complaint. The scenes are all extremely dark; you can barely see what is going on even after adjusting the light levels on your televison. I played this DVD on a HDTV 50 inch large screen televison - maybe if I played it on an old tube TV the picture quality would have been better?? Also.. as others noted, the sound quality is not as good as the original film. Very disappointing purchase - I expected better picture and sound quality from a DVD."
5,My All-Time Favorite movie,"American Graffiti is my all-time favorite movie, and the Blu-Ray version is pristine! The disk is also loaded with making of documentation, and screen tests of the main stars. I have seen the movie quite a few times, but the Blu-Ray version made it stand out."
3,poor copy,"The movie is as good as ever, but the coloring in the copy to DVD didn't come off real good."
5,Rock and Roll!!!,"Before Happy Days and Star Wars and Jaws, there was this great fun movie with Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, and Richard Dreyfuss, and cast of hundreds, not to mention ""Wolfman Jack.""This is a slice of the 50's when boys would be boys and girls would be the gender the boys went after, not to mention all the nonsense the teenagers were up to, like drinking, and trying to make a score, and chasing after girls in fast cars. Harrison Ford has an interesting role as an arrogant, cowboy-style of race car fanatic, and his smirk is so reminiscent of ""Han Solo,"" no wonder that George Lucas tagged him for the role.If you like the oldies, this is it. If you like to laugh and giggle, this is it. If you like to take a trip down memory lane, this is definitely it. Get the popcorn and the drinks, and snuggle up for a nice time of entertainment!!!"
5,an American classic,"Lucas made a movie filled with American archetypes that was followed by dozens of inferior imitators, which turned them into stereotypes. This was the one that started it all. It still seems fresh today. There are moments of pure corn, sure, but many too of sheer exhilaration - the joy of being a teenager on a night out."
5,A Nearly Perfect Movie,"I didn't want to watch the movie as much as dance to it. It was nice they showed what happened to the men, but what about the ladies?"
5,GREAT CLASSIC MOVIE,"""American Graffiti"" is a story about one night in the lives of a group of small town teens. They are all on the verge of something great, but none of them know it yet. That something is called growing up. This night is their farewell to innocent youth. It is an obvious parallel to what America was about to go through. Within a couple of years, most of the people that the film's characters represent would be affected by the chaotic events that occurred in this country. But on this night, none of that existed. These kids were still dealing with the all important activities of cruising, muscle cars, going steady, street racing, the choice between beach music and rock & roll, and whether or not they should wait a year before going off to college. It is the last great American night."
4,American Graffiti,Always an American classic. I was a teenager at the same time and can relate to all the characters. A great introduction to Harrison Ford. Before his scar on his chin.
5,No matter how old you are...,"I wasn't fortunate enough to be around when cruising was at its prime, but after this movie, I wish I could have been. The cars and the atmosphere are something to behold. DVD does the movie justice with high quality sound and clear film. The bonus materials are also a pleasure with a surprisingly long making of the film. No matter how old you are, I think there is something for everybody in this film."
3,Was Better When I Was Younger,"I enjoyed this movie when it came out many years ago. I purchased the DVD to share with my daughter and her friends. The music is still fun and Wolfman Jack is wild, but the overall movie was slow. I was actually bored watching it. The best part was picking out young celebrities that are now as old as I am! I won't tell you it's a bad movie...its a movie for a rainy day when there is nothing else to do."
1,Blu-Ray Review,Blu-Ray Quality stinks. I have no idea what the other reviewers are looking at. I have an OPPO BDP-83 and this Blu-Ray doesn't look any better than a standard dvd.
4,Great Deal,"I will start off by saying I really love this movie. That being said this is really a great deal to have 3 different versions of the film available.On the downside, the picture quality is disappointing. I understand the film is almost 40 years old but it's really easy to tell Universal didn't do much to restore/correct it but simply upscaled the DVD version to a better resolution. Overall the picture is more clear and you can see things (actor's acne, storefront signs) more clear than in previous versions but there is a LOT of digital noise and film grain present throughout the film. On the plus-side the audio seems to have been tweaked a bit so the soundtrack and dialogue sounds great.I give it 4 stars because the film is great, having a digital copy is awesome, and the price is amazingly reasonable."
5,Blu-ray Delivers,"The Blu-ray version of this classic iconic movie is a must have for any collector. The image transfer is impressive especially considering this movie was shot mostly at night. The scenes where the 58 Chevy and the 32 coupe are at Mels are eye popping. You want to stop the film and admire the cinematography. American Graffitti is now better than ever if that is even possible. Feeling down; just pop this blu-ray in and your spirits willl go up. When watching this movie for the umteenth time, I am amazed at how many lines of classic dialogue are in this film. So many laughing out loud moments. Buy this version of American Graffitti and enjoy."
2,"Love the movie, not the DVD","The movie is of course a classic and always fun to watch. What I was disapointed with was this recording. For this being remastered, the sound was awful. I was constantly turning it up and straining to hear. It was reallly awful."
4,Good Boomer Movie,"This movie was as good as I remember it, but (probably due to its age) it's not worth paying extra for Blu-ray. The resolution was no better than standard DVD."
4,The classic coming-of age-in-the-60's flick,"Great tunes, but mediocre video quality-but who cares? A classic!"
5,One of the best movies,"Great movie about us teenagers that grew up in the 60's. This blu ray dvd has great color and sound and has all the interviews of how the movie came to be , how the actors were picked, how the filming was done. etc. I still have a 56 Chevy street rod all hopped up that I go out cruising in on summer nights. I did quite a bunch of the cruising and drag racing in Coalinga, California back in 67 -70 and this movie depicts truly how it was back then."
3,beware of double dip,"Just FYI the ""High School Reunion collection"" version of American Graffiti is just a repackage of '98 version.. Boxart on reverse shows 2003 copywrite but the dvd inside carries a '98 date..and quality of dvd transfer is definitly of that vintage..also prices at wholesale clubs now down below $5..new version must be around the corner??"
3,A Nice But Disappointing Film,"Just before purchasing this film, I saw it on TV and apparently what I saw was a ""Director's Cut"" version. It was very good. Then after seeing the ""Collector's Edition"" on DVD, I was left disappointed due to the deletion of certain scenes, which in my opinion were necessary for the fluidity of the film. This version, has also has a couple of scenes that are so dark that it's hard to make out the actors' faces. At the end during the credits a very thin white edge can be seen on the right side, which makes me wonder if I bought a pirate copy or not.The good part about this version is that the music, which is what really makes this film along with all the nostalgia of the early 60s, is clearly recorded and without the obnoxious bass over-boost that is so prevalent in so many re-makes of old films.For a film that costs just a couple of bucks, I can recommend it, but for higher quality, I would have to recommend a different version."
1,Lucas needs to fix this one too,"Like star wars and thx 1138, there are many spots in american grafitti that are a bit boring and could use the Lucas magic cgi brush to make the movies more exciting and accessible to a younger audience. Lucas could take some tips from great new films like fast and furious and really add some pop to this weathered looser of a movie. Main problem the movie is old the songs are from the 50's(note to Lucas...could use some 50 cent or soldja boy)and there are no special effects to make the driving scenes more awesome. A few superjumps and maybe a shoot out while driving 100 mph could have saved this movie. Where is the lucass magic in this movie?! Its no willow that's for sure."
2,American Graffiti,"I like the movie (story)/acting. The sound that was digitally applied to the DVD, must have been done by someone with no clue how to do their job. There is greast 'DO WOP"", musice tha taccompanies the actors through everyscens. HOWEVER, the music is so loud, it is impossible to hear what the actors are saying, at least 70-80 % of the time.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PARTICULR VIDEO."
4,I was there in '62,"Like Grease, this is a generational classic captured in the wild by George Lucas. I was in high school in 1962 and my brother was away at college.He had a purple hot rod Mercury that got stolen in '62.For us this was a movie about the end of childhood.Rock and Roll will always be deep in our hearts.Wolfman Jack was a real disk player in the 60's the LA area:I had a friend in college who was devoted to his show.The Viet Nam war changed everything...The Beatles replaced Elvis and we couldn't afford the gas for muscle cars after '75. I didn't see this movie when it came out, but heard a lot about it.It was good for the hot rod business of old classic cars that my Dad the hot rodder had.The past is gone: we have to face the present, but I still loved this movie."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An engaging-enough nostalgia piece, American Graffiti has an entirely undeserved reputation as a classic but it's sweet and enjoyable enough to be worth recommending even if it feels somewhat slow due to its unplotted, episodic nature."
1,Poor Quality Film,"I LOVE American Graffiti and was so excited about watching it.. that is until I got it home, and popped it in my DVD player. Everything is so dark, I couldn't see a blasted thing! I realize this is mostly set at night, but I had previously watched this on Direct TV, and remember it to be much brighter, crisp & clear. Just wondering what happened when they made this DVD, that it ended up being so dim. There is a ton of action going on and I'm sitting there just lost, because I can't tell what is going on. It totally ruined it for my viewing pleasure. I'm wondering if there is a particular copy I can get that is not so dark. I don't believe it's my DVD player or television, as I can play other DVD's with no problem. If anybody knows of a different copy that might be more light friendly, could they please recommend. The movie itself is 5 stars, unfortunately the actual film/DVD quality is not. At least not to me anyway."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"Entertaining, uplifting, funny and the cast is outstanding. Harrison Ford is the sleeper and went unnoticed until he played Han Solo in ""Star Wars."""
5,American Graffiti DVD-Wonderful - It's a classic,"Loved that movie since it first came out. Only had a VHS version, so wanted the DVD. It's one of my favorites"
5,A Movie for All Time!!!!,"Fun music!!! Fun people!!! What more can I say? This movie accurately depicts a night of cruising back in the 60's, at least where I grew up in California. I will still be rocking out to this movie when I'm in the old folks home."
5,Exactly how it was.,"Our favorite movie depicting the time that we were teenagers. Cruising, the drive-in, all of it. Love it."
2,A one time film,I didn't find this movie to be that great. There were some funny scenes here and there but nothing special. The movie was very slow with meaningless dialogues. I do love the way the movie was directed. This is a movie which starts during night and ends next day. I really loved that idea and found it unique. It wasn't a movie with a time frame longer than 24 hours and that was neat. The characters were likable for the most part . So why Did I rate this movie so low? I thought the movie could have easily been less longer if it wasn't for meaningless scenes that added nothing to the movie as a whole. Too much dialogue and very boring. There was no point to the movie besides showing people what it was like to be a teen during the 50's. This is the first and last time I watch this movie. A one time movie for me nothing more.
2,Corny,"American Graffiti is really the sort of film that can be regarded as a classic, without its actually being particularly great. It's entertaining, and it makes you laugh, but it's very corny at times, none of the elements are particularly well done, in fact the only reason it's so famous is that it's a clear sign of the times both in which it was made and in which it is set.The various stories it tells about four friends at life's crossroads in the sixties, and the events that befall them on one particular night, are all really quite good.So overall, despite occasional hammy acting or corny line, American Graffiti is definitely worth a look. A sign of the times though it is, it still gives you a good time and a good feeling all these years later"
2,as faraway as mars,"was any place in the world actually like this? I graduated from high school in 1972, and things may have changed a lot in 10 years, but these kids are as foreign to me as would be teenagers who lived in 1500. so, as a person to whom this is not loved for its nostalgia value, it's just plain boring. no story, just cruisin'. you could delete all dialogue and not lose much; its like a long, early pop video."
5,The First Day of the Rest of your Life,"American Graffiti is not only an American Classic, it may be George Lucas best film. The movie centers around a group of just graduated from high school teens and their last nite of Childhood. A very young Ricky Dreyfus and Ron Howard are the two real focal points who are bound for the East coast and college the next day. Between the unbelievable Rock and Roll soundtrack and the Bravo performances this is a movie that will be just as good in 50 years as it was when it came out in 1972. Also the picture looks very sharp on this new Blu Ray disc. Two thumbs Way Up!!!"
4,very good but not great,"While I love the read-aloud Bible stories from Ella Lindvall I was a little disappointed with this Bible. The one thing that I didn't like was the fact that it does have pictures of Jesus in it for the New Testament stories. Lindvall seemed to make a special effort in the read-aloud stories to have images of Christ from behind so that there was no ""face-shot"" but it is not so in this little volume. The illustrations are very good and the stories are nice and short and easy to read. Overall I liked it much much better than many of the other illustrated Children's Bibles out there but might go with the classic volume by Voss if I had it to do over again."
3,"Good, but be careful!","While I appreciate the simplicity of the stories, I just thought to mention that there are a few things that some Christians may not believe to be biblical. Especially troubling to me was the statement that God no longer speaks to people today like He once did in Bible times. Certainly, I agree that all prophesy must be weighed against Scripture, and if what seems to be a word from God contradicts the Bible, it is false. On the other hand, according to my understanding of 1 Corinthians 14:39 (quoted below), it is also wrong to say that God no longer communicates with men directly, even by speaking to them.""Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.""There may be some who support the author's view; however, I wanted to mention that to people interested in this book so that they are aware of what it teaches. May the Lord guide you as you consider this purchase."
3,theological differences,"I got this Bible for my 16 month old, and so far it has been fine for her daily Bible stories. However, I would have liked the stories to be a bit longer, but still it is nice there are so many. I also like the size, which is perfect for her at this age. She enjoys looking at the pictures.One major issue I have with this Bible is that it depicts Jesus' baptism incorrectly. In the picture, Jesus is being 'poured' or 'sprinkled', when in reality He really was immersed. Since we do not even believe in sprinkling or pouring as forms of baptism, this was a bit upsetting for me. Just wanted to let others know if this would concern them as well."
2,Not what I thought.....,"Although the stories are supposed to be 2 pages long, alot of them are 1/2 page. Any time I read this to my 2 year old, I feel like I should keep going with another story. I only bought this book because it was recommended as a Bible lesson book with her preschool homeschool curriculum. Have since moved on to a better book."
1,568 Universal Adapter,The item arrived and when I opened the box I found the item 568 had two parts missing. The evelope had been slit open in the back and the parts removed. IT was useless.
2,not as good as the older one,I have the older version that folds as I lift the handle. It still works after possibly 15 years and has been safe for me.The new one has a locking feature that is practically impossible to unlatch so it can be folded. Still works but I have to keep it open which to say the least is inconvenient. I would not buy another as long as it has this locking feature. Shorty
4,Exactly as described,"Cosco excels in this type of product, we were confident that it would be exactly as described and it was."
1,Not for Lovers of Musicals,Don't buy this if you're looking for a recording of the music from this operetta. This recording is hideous. I was hoping for a soundtrack but this is a children's retelling of the story--and they couldn't even get THAT right with poor recordings of some of the songs. I was terribly disappointed.
5,Serengeti Lion a Study of Predator-Prey Relations.,"""Predators are the best wildlife managers,"" writes George Schaller. His book from the ""Wildlife Behavior and Ecology Series"" is a result of a three year study in the Serengeti National Park. Supplemented by charts and action-depicting photos and drawings, the book describes almost every aspect of lion life, from social structure and behavior within the group to food habits, hunts and the impact of predation on prey population. Although it briefly mentions other predators (mainly the cheetah, leopard, wild dog and some others), the book concentrates mainly on the lion and is highly recommended to any lion fancier or serious conservationist."
3,Not 'popular' writing,"There was a lot of interesting facts about lions in this book, including some that breaks the 'typical' lion I'd learned even though the book is older than I am (for example, male lions don't always fight to the death to keep their pride). However, it's very scientific, a bit dry to read and has a LOT of tables so it's definitely not an easy read."
1,FAKE HORSE POWER,I purchase this product several times before and it is actually a great product but when I purchased it from amazon it was not the real horse power. It wasn't until I purchased it again from a direct supplement company till I realized the difference. The product that I purchased from amazon didnt give me pump at all no energy and taste like kool aide I have been using horse power for 6months and this one just wasnt the real deal even the container is different. and the color of the product.
3,Cute Case,"I had one problem with this case. It was advertised for a k1 krzr, but it is actually for a k1m krzr. However the company was wonderful about refunding my money since it was the wrong item. I would gladly do business with them again. It really is a cute case."
5,Blind Pig Artists: 20th Anniversary Collection,Well packaged and the quality of the recordings were excellent. I love the old Blues and was not disappointed in the selection of songs and artists on the CDs. I'm happy to have them as part of my collection and will enjoy them for many years to come.
1,Complete Waste of Money!,"As a Finance Professional I must say this book was completely unintelligible and I wouldn't recommend it. After reading it, I purchased PIPES: A CEO's Guide to Private Investments in Public Equities"" written by Kleiman and Richards and that book cleared up a lot of my confusion. It is a lot more clear and does a good job of explaining the process of completing a PIPE. If you want a lot of words that don't say anything, buy this book. If you want a quick read that teaches you something, buy the other."
5,Great CD,Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She has thoroughly enjoyed it. I have also listened to it several times and find it very enjoyable. I can highly recommend this CD.
5,great for kids and us adults,"I work in the infant and toddler room of a daycare and we use Jim Brickman's cds for naptime music all the time. But this cd is without a doubt my favorite. It's mellow enough to play during naptime and the kids enjoy it but the adults in the room enjoy it too. And we don't go crazy from hearing another rendition of something like ""5 Little Ducks Went Swimming One Day."" The renditions of classic Disney songs include my favorite ""Reflection,"" but then there's the original song ""Beautiful"" with Wayne Brady that is absolutely Disney like. And the formal American Idols Kimberly Locke and Josh Gracin are wonderful. In short it's a great cd for kids and adults."
4,FORGET the SINGING,I would have liked the CD much better without the singing.The piano playing was all that was needed.
5,Walt Disney Records Presents,"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart makes, and if you grew up in the 50's, 60's, or 70's, this is an album you probably have dreamed about. It isn't just piano music, although Brickman brings out the best of Disney's music with his classy piano retoric. This great album features Phil Collins, Elton John, Sting, Tina Turner, and John Gracin. It is absolutely Califragilistic!!!"
5,Great for All Ages,This is a wonderful album for children and children-at-heart alike. Up-beat yet melodic... these tunes will warm your heart and put a smile on your face.A great present for Disney lovers and new Moms!
3,"Nice, pleasant, okay","Sometimes a Jim Brickman composition transcends normal background music and is absolutely heavenly. I was looking for something to send a 3-year-old who loves music, and insists that his parents play him some new and favorite songs every day. I had read other reviewers' notes on this, and thought it might be the perfect thing - great for kids, great for adults. Actually, I have listened to it twice, and it seems like the kind of pleasant, quiet, familiar music that just melts into the background. Not as creative, dramatic, or varied as I was expecting from this marvelous musician. Perhaps I just need to play it a zillion times much louder (to simulate how it will actually be used in the 3-year-old's house!)."
4,No MP3 available for any of these songs!,"I've searched and hunted but besides ""You"" (which i think there are better songs on this album than that) there are absolutly NO MP3s available for these songs. Especily where i live in Mexico you can't download from the states. Even if there are, they're from these underground sites that don't work no more. CMON, EMI! Make these songs available on MP3!"
3,"Harrison up there with Lennon or McCartney, but not on this album","If you're making a CD-R collection or iPod playlist of a Beatles 1970-2010 comprising the best of their solo years, there's not a lot to pull off this album except `You', the worthy hit single. `Tired of Midnight Blue' almost makes the cut, but its air of fed-up-ness and boredom with the whole late-hours party scene rubs off on the song itself, de-energizing it from appealingly laid-back to near-comatose. `This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)' has a nice guitar solo that could be juxtaposed with the catchy chorus of `Can't Stop Thinking About You' (separated from its tunelessly vapid verses). And that's about it. The rest is strictly for George-only fans as opposed to Beatles fans who simply want to see George with the higher Beatles profile he deserved as of `Abbey Road'."
4,Extra Finely Textured,"Another generally forgotten album from the usual reviewers to George's post Beatle releases, but very mistakingly so because there are some classic songs here that I appreciate based on their own merit. From the 1st song You to This Guitar and Ooh Baby finishing off with His Name Is Legs, from 1975 these tunes show George had songwriting skills from way back that were just always overshadowed and always will be by Lennon/McCartney.This review is worth an easy 4 stars!"
4,Looking forward to the projected remastered version!!!,"I had read the reviews of this album before I had a chance to listen to it, and after being immersed in most of George's other work, I agree I was a little disappointed - AT FIRST. But when I gave it a second listen I found myself really enjoying the numbers on this album.There's a bit of a bluesy, jazzy quality on some of the songs on this CD, and I think George was ahead of his time with that sound. I highly recommend listening to ""The Answer's at the End"" and ""Tired of Midnight Blue"" for that bluesy/jazzy sound.""This Guitar Can't Keep from Crying"" is also a nice song. It harkens to ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" with a heavier sound to it (love the bass riff).George is planning on rereleasing his whole catalog of albums. I suggest not passing this up."
2,George's B-sides,"for me, You & Tired of Midnight Blue are good & His Name is Legs is ok, but the rest are dull & forgettable. the prior lp, Dark Horse had better songs but George singing with a sore throat, which marred what could have been a great lp.this one, his voice is fine but the songs are not. nice album cover though."
1,Overproduced,"The overall material on ""Extra Texture"" just isn't half asstrong as ""Dark Horse"" OR what was to come.""You"" is a fairlytrifling Spectorish tune while ""His Name Is Legs"" is pleasant if minor pop/rock but the album finds the otherwise dynamicGeorge Harrison,great Beatle songwriter,cluttering the production with a string section that's downright boring.Chockedfull of lame songs with no real melody it's BEYOND me why Georgeeven recorded or released this.It was obviously never finishedand it shows-probably a contractual obligation album.EverythingHarrison made before OR after this (including his newest album)are highly recommended over THIS.Not even for completists!"
3,Great to play Late,"This album is a notch above ""Dark Horse""....the opening track is ahea dof it's time, with an 80's feel, already in 1975! ""The Answer's At The End"" is an exquisite track, worthy of his earlier efforts...""This Guitar"" (Can't Keep From Crying is enjoyable and grows on you with repaeted play.....but the true hilight here is a track called ""Tired of Midnight Blue""...excellent, deserving to be placed with his best...George is returning to great form, and his best period artistically 1976-89 was looming ahead..."
1,Just Awful-Hideous!,"This was a truly failed attempt at a decent album. I often wondered what George was thinking when he put this hopeless record out!There were no good songs on here, buy All Things Must Pass."
5,Titanic Model,"Ok...let me just start with WOW! This item is very detailed and the pieces are very tiny and will take lots of time and patients to build. This is truly a model for an experienced builder, however, the results are spectacular."
2,New twist on Myers Brigg?,"Probably not even a new twist. If you want a personality test that tells you the same thing, then the Myers Brigg Type Indicator is the most recognized 'test' available. This book rehashes the same materiel that has even more scientific data and analysis backing it up.The indicator in the book does not include the scoring mechanism, so it becomes difficult to actually use, or be of use."
3,more like wool,"When I buy cashmere, I expect the softest material. This one felt like wool and was thin. Not what I was looking for, so I sent it back."
4,Cashmere Gloves,"Great value for the price. The gloves, ordered as a gift, arrived on time. However, I ordered the ""white"" gloves and the color was not a true white, more of a cream color. Definately not white.The cashmere was very soft and she said they were kept her hands warm."
3,hot men,"this movie is good only cause pf the ,male actors. Especially David Usher and John smith who show of their incredible bodies as they screw. buy it now"
4,They're nails - Ok Brads,"I needed some 1"" nails these feed and drive as well as any. The price was sufficiently like competitors so that what is probably a five years supply for a hobbiest isn't cost prohibitive and it was convenient to order them with other stuff."
3,Nails were rusted,"I may have simply gotten a bad batch but many of the strips of nails in the box were rusted and couldn't be used so keep that in mind when ordering these. It's a risk you always take when you buy these types of products online and like I said, it may have just been a bad batch that I got."
3,"Its pretty good, however","Its pretty good for something from 20 years ago, however, I was worried my toddler would get A.D.D. watching it because the scenes are constantly changing and erratic. My toddler enjoys ""Toddler Tunes"" and ""Silly Songs"" by cedarmontkids much more."
2,really generic,Would not recommend this to a freind.Boring I made the kids sit through it once and then it was put away for ever!!!
4,Lasted through the years,I am a Grandmother now. My daughters had lots of videos they watched when they were younger but this one tops their MEMORIES.I recently purchased for my new Grandbaby!
3,Not the best of the Kidsongs videos,"My 2 year old daughter loved ""Kidsongs - Baby Animal Songs"" so much that I bought this product sight unseen. I have to say I am a little disappointed. Baby Animal Songs is really good and mesmerized my daughter (I give that video 5 stars). For this one, she makes it through about 5 minutes and starts yelling ""nooo!"" I have to say that it is a little dated, but beyond that, it is also sort of creepy, especially the scarecrow character. I also think the songs are ordered wrong and it starts a little too slow. Your kid may love it, and it definitely is better than most of the videos out there, but my picky daughter didn't care for it."
3,"A little dated, but entertaining","I bought this video because my 22-month old son loves animals. The video is pretty dated and the quality is not the best, but he was entertained. There really isn't as much focus on the animals like I had hoped, but the songs are cute."
5,Memories,"I grew up watching this on video and my mom recently gave me a stack of Kidsongs Videos that she was going to through away. I'm so glad she asked me first because my 20 month old, busy boy, who never sits still has loved sitting and watching these videos. I'm so excited to have found them on DVD so he can enjoy them for many years like I did."
5,Best video ever!,"My 19 month old son stops for nothing...except this video. He was mesmerized from the first time he saw it, and he begs to watch it at least once a day. We have other videos that we've borrowed, but he doesn't even act like they're on. Old MacDonald's Farm is great! Kids, songs, animals, dancing...it's got it all! I highly recommend this to anyone with kids!"
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS CARNIVAL DIABLOS,BUT WAY BETTER THAN ALL FOR YOU",WHEN I HEAR OF ANNIHILATOR RELEASING NEW ALBUMS A CERTAIN COURIOSITY COMES OVER ME.I GUESS I EXPECT EVERY ALBUM TO BLOW ME AWAY SUCH AS CARNIVAL DIABLOS DID.SCHIZO DELUXE IS WAY BETTER THAN ALL FOR YOU BUT IT STILL IS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT.IM NOT A BIG DAVE PADDEN FAN.I THINK WITH A BETTER VOCALIST THEY COULD BE WAY BETTER.I DO LIKE THE GUITAR RIFFS AND THE MUSIC DOESN'T DISSAPOINT BUT IF THEY CONTINUE WITH DAVE PADDEN I MIGHT HAVE TO SKIP THE NEXT ONE.
5,THE SONGS OF A LIFE,"THE GREATEST SONGS ARE COMPILATED IN THIS 2 CD. YES, FOR LISTENING FROM THE FIRST TO THE END, BASIC AND COMPLETE. BUY IT!"
1,No Cure for Bad Writing,I really enjoyed the Inspector Banks series which has interesting characters and plots. This book has neither and is written in such a trite way it is impossible to finish. I started the book on two different occasions and just decided this book wasn`t worth my time. I can`t believe that Peter Robinson wrote this book or that someone thought it was fit to publish.
5,Great big sound,This sounds so good for the money. No........ its not a Bose system but for the money you cant go wrong. The bass sounds good as it should since it has an amp built in that needs plugged in seperatly from the system.
2,Had to return it ...,"I had to return this item because the power button for the radio was not working. The first night after I received this, it suddenly powered on the radio on its own. I was woken from my sleep and first I thought maybe I had set the alarm while trying things out and so I just tried to snooze. But nothing worked and I was not in a mood to investigate and just pulled the plug.The next day I checked and plugged it back and the radio did not come on automatically. But couple of hours later, it again started on its own and I was not able to switch it off. The only way to shut it down was by plugging it off.On a positive note, the projection was neat and my wife liked it very much. We projected to the ceiling and we could just wake up, open our eyes and see the time. I will checking for similar clocks and buy another one.The clock also had the option to switch the projection upside down and so basically you can place the clock anywhere and can project the time to any wall .."
1,Clock,"I purchased this clock, took it out of the box, plugged it in. IT DID NOT WORK. Should I say more?"
1,bad projector,"I liked the looks of this model, and the big numbers on the clock, but the projection had a mind of its own! It worked fine the first two nights - after that it would sometimes turn on, sometimes not - if I got it on, then it might go off in a hour or so, and maybe come back on several hours later. After almost a week it just quit completely - nothing would get it on! My husband told me not to buy an Emerson! I should have listened to him - then I wouldn't have had to return it. Don't waste your money - buy a better quality brand even if it cost a lot more!"
1,Used not new shouldn't sell it,"This item was not new, it had been used unlike what you posted. The stickers on the clock radio face were re-applied badly and clumsily hiding a scratched screen. The clock does not keep it's time nor does it ring accurately if at all. It is already been put in the garbage as it is too expensive to return to the seller. Bought two clocks at the same time. One is in the garbage, the other one is only being used for displaying time as alarm does not work. I had purchased a same clock-radio model from a local retail store 4 years ago and it runs beautifully. That is why I wanted 2 more because they are so dependable. You fooled me greatly and I am very displeased. Will never buy from this seller again. You are my first online purchase disappointment in numerous years of buying online. Thank you for making me one of those ""doubtful"" customers.M"
2,Not for sound sleepers!,"Works great! Easy to use...great features. My only beef is the buzzer alarm and it's real deal-breaker. It starts at a whisper and gradually crescendos to a conversation-level tone. Or rather, the level of a conversation you might have in, say, the same room with a person you didn't want to wake up. With all the nifty options on this clock, it's disappointing they didn't include a volume adjustment for the buzzer. To be fair, an adjustment is available for the radio option, but if you're like me, you won't wake up to a radio until they play one of those emergency broadcast system tests."
1,"if you are anything other than a very light sleeper, this is not for you","the basic functionality of this product is very good, the big problem is that the alarm is not loud at all. I need an alarm that will wake the dead, not an alarm that might wake a lightly sleeping kitten."
2,Good product - horrible customer service,"I purchased one of these clocks and was pleased. I decided to purchase two more as gifts. After placing the order, the distributors of the clock - ANTONLINE cancelled my order with no explanation. I emailed them directly over a week ago and have received no response. This is not a good position to put me in given I was planning to give these out as gifts. I will not recommend a product from a company that leaves you guessing as to whether they really want to sell their product or not."
5,Wonderful Clock,We had one of these clock/radios in our room and put one in the guest room....Our guest love it. So we purchased one for a gift and I think they too will give one as a gift....Love not having to get up to see the time in the middle of the night....great price fast delivery...thank you
4,Pretty good alarm clock,"Nice clock, does what it promises to do. I have only a few complaints:1. First and foremost, the alarm will stop ringing an hour after the time you set it for, even if you've been snoozing it all that time. This is a big problem for people who like to snooze many times before getting up, because after the 6th snooze it will not ring again.2. Secondly, the interval of snooze is not settable, and is around 9 minutes.3. The snooze button is big, but not too prominent, and when I grope for it after just waking up it takes me 2-3 seconds to hit it - but this is not a deal breaker."
3,BIG numbers,I bought this for the large time projection and this feature works very well. Reception of the radio is disappointing.
4,Easy to see...great product!,"We've had our SmartSet for at least three years and have been thrilled with it! No more having to rollover to see the time or trying to see over my husband's shoulder. The projection feature is terrific in that it is bright and big enough to read without being offensive. We just had my sister-in-law and her husband spend the weekend and let them sleep in our bedroom. They liked the projection feature so much that I ordered one for them the next morning! It would have received five stars but sometimes the radio reception isn't the best. However, we use it more for the projection and alarm features than we do for the radio. It's definitely a good addition to our bedroom!!!"
1,Projector is dim,"The projector would not work at all when I opened the box and set it up. Later in the same day I tried again and it worked fine. I set it up in my bedroom. The next morning the projector worked but was very dim, much dimmer than the night before when I set it up. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked fine again. Went to bed the 2nd night and it was dim again and will not get back to its original brightness. Very disappointed. Now I have to package up and return. BIG DISADVANTAGE TO BUYING ON LINE, RETURNS!!"
2,On my third one,I love this clock I just wish it would stop breakin. The first one would on play AM stations. The second one the projection stoped working (that was the main reason for purchase of this one) Now I purchased these at Target not thru Amazon but it is the same item. Now I am on the third one and am crossing my fingers.
1,I don't know how this clock gets such a high rating,I bought on of this clocks at radio shack and within a year both of the alarms stopped working. I foolishly bought another and within a few months one of the alarms stopped working. I expect the other will fail at any time. There can always be one lemon in a otherwise good product but two in a row leads me to believe it is a flawed product.
4,digital clock,"Nice clock but the digital projector is unnecessary... I should have went with the ones without.... But, if you like light shows you will love this product...."
1,Good Thing it's discontinued,"This thing died after 4 months. Started showing the wrong time, error messages, the radio going off for no reason and wouldn't turn off. It's a good thing they stopped making it as its a piece of junk."
2,all was dandy until the projector bulb blew,I have had this clock for eleven months. I loved all the features about this clock until the bulb went out for the projector feature. I tried to take it apart to see if I could just replace the bulb but there isn't just a lightbulb component once you get inside of it. It is a giant part that is soldered so the entire part would need to be replaced and I am guessing that one part probably costs as much as the entire clock. I really loved this clock until the projector decided not to work anymore and this was the primary reason for choosing this clock out of all the others.
1,Projector display started burning out after 60 days,"I have a different version of this clock at my home, but I ordered this one for an apartment out of state where I work. Unfortunately, the projector display started to burn out at about the 60 day mark. I'd avoid this model and move up to the unit with the dual-color choice. That is still working after a few years."
1,"Nice, if and when it works!","This was my second Emerson CKS3516. I very much liked my first one, but it failed to function after a power outage in our neighborhood, although no other electrical or electronic devices in the house were harmed. I purchased another, through Amazon.com. The tuner was of such low quality that our favored, local NPR station could not be pulled in with a legible signal, even though every other radio in the house (including the first Emerson CKS3516) receives this signal with no trouble and with great clarity. This deficit caused me to return the radio. I read online reviews, and discovered that many buyers complained about non-functioning radios, many breaking within the first few months of use. The features are wonderful, but there appears to be no reasonable expectation for a reliable product. That is a shame, since the time projection system is a rare, but useful, feature."
2,Love the features - Hate the lack of quality,"Bought two of these from Target because I and my daughter wanted the projection feature and like the dual alarm modes. Only can use the red projection because the blue and green are too bright even on low. They setup pretty easy for a clock radio and all seemed well. After less then a year my daughter's completely died...no clock, no radio, nothing. Around the same time the center line on the ones digit of ours stopped working...and it started to make a very high pitch electric whine. I have to get rid of it because it keeps me up at night. Other one already went to electronics recycling heaven."
2,Projection Broke,"I really liked the clock when I first got it, but the projection broke after about 2 weeks. The numbers are all jumbled looking. I'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem. If it weren't for this I would be happy with the product. I do not have the box anymore, but am going to try and return it."
3,Not bad for the price,Great display-large numbers and i like that you can rotate the numbers depending on how your shining the display (ie....right wall left wall ceiling etc.... you can rotate the way the numbers show so it is never backwards.)
3,"Lovely playing, but the performance is soporific (and the timing stingy)","You'd have to be a maniac for the Sibelius Second or for the Royal Concertgebouw to settle for a 44 min. CD, even if it does come in excellent SACD sound (which I listened to in regular two-channel stereo). Early in his career, when he put the Oslo Phil. on the musical map, Mariss Jansons scored a success with a vital, fresh account of this symphony. The new one is only a couple of minutes slower, but where's the life gone? Caution and elegance of expression, the hallmarks of this performance, are the last things Sibelius needs. He asks for epic sweep, a mystical conneciton with nature, and primordial strength. If Jansons has an inkling of this, he doesn't display it here. Given the number of cautious CDs Jansons has released so far on the RCO Live label, I wonder if the good people of Amsterdam aren't having second thoughts about his appointment."
2,"Lightly Padded, but don't seem to be for Girls","I was looking for slider shorts for my two girls when I came across these. I was happy to see youth girls sizes. I'm sorry to report the crotch seems to have extra room for a boy. I could have bought these anywhere. Dissappointed... though they will work, the girls are a little grossed out."
5,great tool for keeping fit on the go,"This deck is a great tool to help you add strengthening and stretching into your overall exercise plan more often. The deck is easy to take with you, on business or on vacation. The workouts are written so you can squeeze it into a short time interval or a longer one depending on what youhave. The cards are easy to follow, even for kids. This has been a great tool for me to use as a fitness instructor for children to get them more involved in these types of activities. It is fun for them to each pick a card and then in turn lead the whole group in that particular stretching or toning exercise. I highly recommend the deck for anyone who likes to keep things simple while seeking some guidance and structure to their exercise plan either at home or on the go."
3,NYX Golf Sunglasses Tour Shield Crystal Black Frame with Traditional 3 Lens Set 99401,The NYX Golf Sunglasses Tour Shield Crystal Black Frame with Traditional 3 Lens Set 99401 are great except for the Temples with the rubber on the end. That part of the glasses frame breaks over time! They should do away with that and just make it completelly out of plastic! Do away with the rubber ends on the temples! Period!
5,An HO Favorite,You'll marvel at the detail-from the precise re-creation of the locomotive engine to the familiar Santa Fe color scheme.
5,Nighty Night,"My 5 1/2 year old daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She has always had a hard time winding down. I was a little skeptical but thought I'd try it out today on my 2 1/2 year old son who has been trying to give up his afternoon naps. My daughter had no interest in it as she was afraid that it might actually work! My son was asleep by the time the cat in the video began to close his eyes (about 5 minutes into the video). This was pretty impressive since his sister was in the room making fun of it the entire time, pretending to fall asleep and fall off the couch onto the floor several times. I think there should be an age limit. For my 2 year old, it worked like a charm. By the time the child is 5, they become too smart!!"
4,Surprise - It Works!,"When I first saw this video, I was astounded at its short length and its simplistic redundancy, and I thought we'd been ripped off. My 2yo daughter obviously felt otherwise: this video calms her down at the end of a day so that putting her to bed is easy! She has absolutely no interest in it during the day - it's definitely a nighttime thing."
2,Works great on adults but not our toddler!,"We were excited to get this video after ""Dr. Phil"" raved about it. Well, the quality of the tape was a disappointment. Our toddler started to watch it and enjoyed the animals, but lost interest when they started showing the stars a lot. Although the music was calming, it did not get her sleepy nor in the mood for bedtime. It did, though, do a great job in making us parents sleepy. So, if any adults out there have a difficult time sleeping, then get this video for yourself!"
3,Not Sure,"I bought this because my daughter refused to sleep in her room. I'm not sure that it worked. She liked watching the animals. It would keep her quiet and interested, but when the video was over 9 times out of 10...she was wide awake! (Mom and dad may not be!!) I'm going to try it again though. Not to send her to dreamland. I am going to try to incorporate it into her routine at night as a calming down of sorts. It's a cute video, the animals are great, the music is great but it DOES NOT make my child simply fall asleep!"
1,Don't Expect Miracles for the High Need Child,"I am happy this works for some children. My child has difficulty winding down to go to bed at night. Due to its reasonable price and great reviews, I was willing to try this product.I just want to let you know that it does not work for all children. If you have a high need child, don't expect this video to be a miracle to put them to sleep. I played this video for my high need toddler (2 years old) and she watched it all the way through then asked to watch something different. She hasn't asked for this video again. When given the choice of two videos, she doesn't ever choose this one.If you have a high need child with difficulty going to sleep, then I suggest you read Dr. Sears' book Nighttime Parenting: How to Get Your Baby and Child to Sleep and Elizabeth Pantley's book The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night. They will be more helpful to you then this video."
5,Bedtime Peace at Last,This video is an answer to our prayers. It transformed our nightly bedtime routine from trauma to tranquility. Our kids (2 and 4) actually look forward to going to bed now that they can watch this video. Well done!
3,The little video that could...,"You won't be disappointed in this little video (emphasis on ""little""), parents, if you remember 3 things: It's short, it's very low-production, and don't rely on it to put your toddler right to sleep. I almost didn't purchase it, due to so many of the customer ratings being ""I like it, but..."" Ultimately, though, I'm glad I did. The strength of this tape are the darling animal segments, which I'd describe as well-done amateur photography. Some of the accompanying music sounds homemade, which is simultaneously charming and annoying. My little boy loves the animals, but gets bored with the starry sky & Liberace-style piano, which makes up about the last third of the tape. Once the animals are gone, he asks to watch something else. My biggest complaint is that it's way too short, with too sudden a change from action to sleepy time--- not enough of the winding down stage. Overall, though, it's a worthwhile purchase."
5,Mr. B does it again!,"Mr. B has done it again. He has made his unique blend of boogie-woogie and blues sound both fresh and fun. When he's not touring Europe, he plays in the Ann Arbor area. I have seen him perform many times, and he just keeps getting better! Just listen to ""30 Days in Jail"" and you'll be hooked. It's too bad some of his early vinyl offerings haven't been transferred to CD."
3,Polished ho-hum with a little oomph!,"I like blues, boogie and jazz and play the piano. Mister B is a mixed bag, with a polished style and some nice licks but he mostly stays within the confines of his predecessors. So, in my opinion, you get one good song out of four or five and the rest are OK but nothing new - pleasant but style-wise fairly mundane. My own tastes run to Pine Top Perkins,Memphis Slim, Dr. John, Otis Spann, Prof Longhair. James Booker, Henry Butler, etc. When I want to hear period stuff, why get it re-packaged? Mister B is pleasantly OK and every once in a while outstanding. I remember how much I enjoyed hearing him play ""Little Brother"" and I spent some time stealing some of the licks . I would purchase this recording - I just wouldn't give it five stars or expect that your hair is going to stand up the first time you put it on. Leave that to the masters!"
4,Wow - great to hear Mr. B again.,"Haven't heard Mr. B in years. Used to see him with Steve Nardella Band and that was quite an experience! I remember him rolling up to a closed off intersection at the Ann Arbor arts fair, sliding the piano off the truck and sitting down to play in the middle of the intersection. The crowd would swell instantly! Hey, maybe you gotta have soome Ann Arbor connection - but this man is great. I just got this CD yesterday and I'm lovin' it. Everyone walking by the office is asking about the great music...."
5,Excellent for those Christians ready for real change...,"No feel-good message here. No fire and brimstone either. Just clear, biblical exhortation from a man with an obvious heart for following God. Murray's main point is that complete obedience, while impossible to practice, must be an absolute commitment on our part for us to walk in Christ. Basic things that are rote memorized truths in Christians minds are here restated in a way that will prod you to reconsider your level of true, deep obedience. I highly reccomend this book for anyone hungering for more..."
3,Disappointed...in cost,"Disappointed in this purchase. It isn't easy to find scented stickers anymore and I was looking forward to giving these to my 9 year old daughter. When I saw 525 stickers I figured I'd be getting a lot, especially with the $12 price tag. The stickers are nice and I like them but I think very overpriced especially with the $6 s & h charge. I expected a box of stickers. Overall, product good, pricing not so good."
3,Eh.,Sickeningly sweet. My littles need more substance than this. Why do so many authors assume that kids are stupid?
1,Installation problems for Epson 4870 USB 2.0 Windows XP,"The scanner works fine, but slowly in USB 1 ports. When connected to the USB 2.0 hub, although the scanner was recognized by Windows XP, there was no response from the scanner, although on and properly connected. Several hours of uninstalling and reinstalling its software and downloading USB patches and updating drivers from Viaarena.com did nothing to solve the problem. If the problem isn't cracked in the next day or so, the scanner is going back where it came from."
4,4870 & Digital Ice,"The ""Digital Ice"" technology ONLY works with color film--even on a dedicated film scanner, so this is normal. As an inexpensive flatbed scanner that can also handle film scans, Epson has done an incredible job. (Inexpensive compared to high-end scanners) All this in a sub-$500.00 package, with a D-Max of 3.8 is really outstanding and worth the investment if you are an artist or photographer on a shoe-string budget. Worth the price, if you're also willing to tinker with the software settings before making your scans, and you're using Adobe Photoshop to finish the job when the scan is complete..."
2,The video head tape is dirty!,"My kids love car, boats and trains. Although, the video head tape is dirty, they still seem to enjoy it. Thank you!"
5,This aint Michael Moore...,"A really unbiased entertaining presentation of the people of Crawford, with excellent character development. This is a really good movie, and I highly recommend it."
1,Completely unbiblical,"Hebrews 9:27 states: ""it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment.""We come to the judgement only once, we will see the terrors of hell or the joys of heaven only at our appointed time of death. Anyone who tells you that they've had extra-biblical visions of heaven or hell are false prophets, and believers should flee from them.This movie and the book are in enmity with scripture.1 John 1:6 states ""If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.""What greater darkness is there to lie and not practice the truth?"
4,The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven,"I thought I had ordered the book but instead it was a DVD. I obviously did order the DVD and I'm happy I did. It was more vivid seeing it along with ""reading"" it. It was very good and in mint condition. Thanks muchPatsy Cookpatsycook70@cox.net"
5,worth the price alone...,"yeah, they play all of reign in blood. but let's forget the coolest reason this is worth owning: the band have taken ""raining blood"" quite literally. during that song actual red dye floods the band and the stage, making that stormy thunder in the beginning of the song that more ominous. a trick they will use during their jagermeister tour. awesome"
3,Good Live Footage but Not Much Else,"This DVD is pretty much a 30 minute concert of the entire Reign in Blood CD with some ""extra footage"" that is lumped in. The sound quality is good. The band commentary is short but informative. If you are a long time Slayer fan you will not learn anything new from the band commentary but it is a nice addition.I would say this DVD is a good buy if you are a die hard Slayer fan and want to see the Reign in Blood CD performed live. Expect that this is a short DVD. I have to say as a long time Slayer fan I am pleased with this DVD."
5,WARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!,"no words are neccessary for this--IT IS SLAYER--buy it or Kerry King will hunt you down & physically KILL you!!!!Secondly it is Reign In Blood played in it's entirety, which for all those who don't know already, it's the fastest, most brutal, while still being musical, METAL ALBUM EVER MADE!!! PERIOD NO QUESTION.Speed, Thrash, Metal in general begins & ends with this album, sorry Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax or anybody else you can conjure up. NOBODY DOES IT FASTER OR BETTER THAN SLAYER!!!In fact buy this DVD & the CD Reign In Blood at the same time.ALSO to all SLAYER FANS OUT THERE on 6/6/06 SLAYER will be releasing an exclusive EP only in Hot Topic stores & it will feature 1 new track from the new album (WITH DAVE BACK IN THE FOLD) & also 6/6/06 is the NATIONAL DAY OF SLAYER so listen to them LOUD & PROUD or again KERRY KING WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!!!!"
5,great quality DVD,"Awesome band, and a Nice DVD: Great Sound, great picture, as well as one of the best finishing sets I have seen since GWAR (you'll see what I mean)Anyway, my only MINOR complaint is that the audience didn't seems as thrilled as slayer did about going through the entire album. Fans where not as active on some songs and had that look of ""when are they going to play my song."" On their faces...or ""what song is this"" maybe it was a more mainstream slayer crowd...any show I ever scene them at (which I have seen them about 5 times live) their audience was way more aggressive than this one on EVERY song. As a matter of fact, the first time I seen slayer in upstate NY I seen 7 people taken out in stretchers....Anyway. Great DVD...support metal and buy this!"
5,Slayer really are Still Reigning,"Slayer having taken their ""breakout"" album Reign in Blood, recorded the entire performance live last August. Although Seasons in the Abyss is my favorite Slayer album, this DVD is killer. The camera work is flawless, and the documentary is better than the one than in War at the Warfield. There are also a few extra songs played live."
5,There are many ways to achieve death...,"I can't figure out why I just puked...was it my girlfriends' Thai food leftovers, the Smirnoff green apple, or perhaps the savage headbanging I found myself unable to stop doing as this disc played...probably a combination of the three...Slayer man...rad."
3,Great concert and audio but not Anamorphic,"I just saw Slayer a few nights ago in Sayreville, NJ and they were awesome. I was hoping to see the entire Reign in Blood album performed live but they did not do that instead they had a set list that was like the one on War at Warfield. The concert footage and audio on this DVD is great. However, the video is non-Anamorphic unlike War at Warfield that was Anamorphic. I assume that Universal had something to do with this since they were involved in this release unlike the War at Warfield release. I have deducted two stars for the non-Anamorphic transfer. Anamorphic transfer have been the industry standard for a couple of years so it makes no sense why Univeral would provide us with a letterbox non-Anamorphic transfer."
5,SLAYER LIVE 2004!!!!!!!!!,"As long as MAB never sees this DVD, the world will be left insane...I just got my copy locally for $9.99...I rate this DVD a 5... yes 5 missing songsI'm not understanding why they cut the 5 songs...especially after the delays (AGAIN AND AGAIN), and they original anounce ment of the track listing the day after the show in Maine..and last but LEAST, TOMM WHATS UP WITH THE SETLIST...Last nights show in MilwaukeeSlayer2004-11-03Eagles BrawlroomMilwaukee, WI""4 More Wars, 400,000 More To Die""AT853's > SP Bass Roll-Off 107hz > PCM-M120 Feet from Jeff's Stacks Left SideDiscipleWar EsambledAt Dawn They SleepFight Till DeathStain of MindBloodlineMandatory SuicideHallowed PointNecrophiliacDead Skin MaskSeasonChemical Warefare >Hell AwaitsSouth of Heaven >Angel of DeathPostmordum >Rain In Blood - [NO BLOOD BATH ]*Breaks in setlist is how Slayer takes Breaksshow was 90 minutesGo see Slayer this JagerFest Fall 2004"
2,I really can't review this....................,"This DVD is strickly for full fledged head-on Slayer fans. I got curious and bought it to see how they all played out on stage since I purchased the CD ""Seasons In The Abyss"" which I think is great! Slayer sends the wrong message all around in concert and that's only my opinion. Slayer fans enjoy this one because it is very ""raw"" to say the very least."
4,Great resource for home & small group therapy,"This is a very complete guide to using swiss balls (also known as therapy balls or gymnastic balls). The exercises are grouped by skill with the goals of the exercise clearly described. The suggested modifications for children with disabilities are also very helpful. Though the book is clearly targeted at school phys ed programs, we found it very easy to use at home with all our children."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!,"Be careful before considering buying this unit! The description does not tell you that it is not compatible with many PCs because it requires a so-called ""fully powered USB port"" even if this is not specified in the description on the Amazon site.I ordered one in May, it did not work on my hardware (even though I tried on several PCs that were supposed to have fully powered ports, even tried on powered USB hubs) and since then I am struggling to get it fixed or refunded: Amazon tells me to contact Optics Planet, Optics Planet tells me to contact Meade, and Meade is simply unreachable.So if you are willing to waste 700$, go ahead!!"
2,Five Jokes Per Penny. Any Takers?,"At the rate of 5 jokes per penny how could this book not be a good deal? The jokes by now are very dated. It is really a history of what used to be funny. The problem is you have to search through so many old jokes to find one you might use. I have belatedly discovered that jokes books are not of much value in public speaking. Using other peoples old jokes could really ruin your image. May be this book is good for a humor historian. It may be useful in stimulating your own joke creation. All in all for some the book is worth the price, just be sure you can accept all the clutter before you buy it. The editorial reviews are deceptive--look out."
5,Another Great Blind Pig Release,This is a great album with a bunch of friends coming together to have a good time. I am a big fan of any Blind Pig Records; so much so that if I see one of their releases I get it. Never have I been disappointed. They seem to be a record company that the musicians like and it comes out in the quality of their releases.
2,Not a satisfactory ink,I expect fountain pen ink to be opaque and to stand out well on the page. This ink does not satisfy these expectations. The ink is thin and watery; in fact in the bottle the ink appears transparent. It does not stand out well on the paper and has more of an orange hue than I would expect for a red ink. I'm going to stick with Noodlers for my fountain pen inks.
2,The color is misleading...,This ink is not what you would expect from a red ink. Although the Lamy green ink is an acceptable shade of green( though I still think it is a little too light) this shade of red is almost pink/orange. Half the time i'm convincing myself that this is red at all. I mixed it with some Lamy green ink and it turned to a nice Burgundy color. 7Part red to 1 part green is the formula.
1,Awful!,"I was looking forward to this album, but after listening to the first disc ( and wanting to turn it off sooner, but wanted to give it a fair run), I found the sounds to be poor even on quality equipment. I enjoy doo wop, but this was too ""screechy"" and difficult to listen to."
3,Tastes like their nonorganic version,"Although this popcorn is soooo much better than Newman's, I did not feel I should rate it 5 stars since there has been a lot of concern in the organic community that the standards for USA organic certification have been drastically lowered so the major food conglomerates may easily get their products organic certified. It is therefore possible we paying premium price for a questionable organic product like the issues w/ ""organic"" products from China. Knowing this, why did I order? Three reasons-just finished a case of Newman's which took forever since I didn't really like it, but it was expensive so I felt I HAD to use it; prior to ""going organic"", I was a loyal Redenbacher fan; and the enticing coupon special."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,I've reread this novel 3 times. I've read all of this author's kindle books and this is one of my top favorites. I love the characters. I love the story. So real and yet so gut wrenching as the secrets are revealed. Don't miss out on this one.
3,Took a while to get into....,"For me, this book was very slow to get into the actual story. I felt bored in the first 150 pages and felt as though many of the conversations were useless and quite meaningless in those pages. The characters were not introduced or developed well in the beginning and I think that was part of the problem. I really didn't get a feel for them and who they were until late in the book. It just seemed really poorly organized for what could have been a poignant story had I known the characters better earlier on. To give credit, the writing and the story improved in the second half."
4,Very Good Read with Lovable Flawed Characters - LOTS OF PASSION,"This book was very easy to get into. The first few chapters made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed getting to know all of the characters (and believe me, there are many of them). At times, I had to stop and figure out who was who.Ms. Carlyle's writing makes you care about the characters, even the ones who aren't perfect. ESPECIALLY the ones who aren't perfect. The love ""scenes"" are passionate... very passionate. And although I enjoyed them very much, I found myself speed reading through a few of them to find out where the story took Freddie and Bentley's relationship. I desperately wanted to know Bentely's secrets. I had my suspiscions (and I was right), but I didn't KNOW I was right until almost the very end.This is a beautiful and touching love story, and I highly recommend it."
5,Dark and satisfying,"Since many others have before me, I won't bother with a plot synopsis. I will say that this is a dark story tastefully done with incredibly lifelike characters. Freddie is young and pregnant, so naturally she's a bit on the hysterical side when it comes to dealing with her incredibly moody husband. Bentley is obviously more than just a carefree rake and finding out what drives his self-destructive behavior explains it. Carlyle goes into dangerous territory here, but she handles it well.I had not read any of the other stories Bentley, Freddie or anyone but Kemble appeared in before this one and I did not find myself overwhelmed by secondary characters or shortchanged in terms of main character development."
3,Darker Subject Matter,"This was my first LC book, and I felt that I missed a lot by not having read the previous stories. There was very little back story for Bently - the author assumed we already knew him. And, I needed more background on he and Freddie. It seems like they were thrown together on the second page.This was a good book, but after reading all the rave reviews, I really was expecting a lot more. Freddie came off a little nagging - always wanting to plan for the future. I get that she was pregnant, and wanted security for the baby, but she yapped about it way too much.Also, the dark subject matter of Bently's childhood was a bit much for me. Not really into that stuff for my romance novels. I like them to be light and fun.I'll end by saying it was a good book, and had I read the whole series I may have enjoyed it more."
1,Boring,"I bought this book because of the recommendation on the cover by Linda Howard. However, I'm glad I only paid half-price of this. Outside of the first chapter, the book is boring. ""Freddie"" barely stands up for herself. ""Bentley"" was by far the best character in the novel, but I had a hard time feeling sorry for him, even after the ""reveal.""I would recommend check this out from the library."
3,Tragic Love Story,The Devil You Know by Liz Carlyle breaks your heart. Frederica and Bentley have know each other for years. They have one night of adventure and it turns their lives upside down. Bentley has some many secret and one lost note sends everything into chaos.
2,Not so good,The story line was alright...but I got lost with all the many different family members histories. If you haven't read any of her other books this one may be confusing....I do not plan to read any of her books again.
1,Perfect if you have a fifth grade reading level,"This book is horrible. It is written using the most elementary language possible. In fact, I can't believe a grown woman wrote it. The dialogue is boring, uninspired and juvenille. The heroine is a silly girl that whines her way through the story, and the hero is a sap. I like sentimental men that aren't afraid to show their tenderness, but this guy just grated on my nerves. I can't believe how many times I rolled my eyes in disgust or exasperation. I made it a little past halfway, and I just threw it in the donation pile, I couldn't read one more page of it. If I could, I'd give it no stars."
2,not impressed,"The characters are strange. Not sure exactly what their history was, so it's hard to understand why they act the way they do. I didn't enjoy it and I didn't like the characters."
4,Not bad...,"The story in this book was what caught my attention, but I found the writing hard to swallow. It was almost like she was writing to a younger audience, with adult themes. The story was great, but I can't give it five stars because to be honest, the book didn't hold my attention like it should. I found myself skimming, instead of reading."
5,"stunning photographs, extraordinary research","Astounding images abound in this book, which will draw you into the world of stepwells. Little-known even in India, these architectural constructions extend deep underground, into a shadowy world of water, dust, filtered sunlight, reflections, and shelter from the oppressive heat. This is an amazing book, a comprehensive and thorough survey of this forgotten architecture."
3,Black and White Simple Minds,"Strong evocative album. Certainly far from their best(New Gold Dream, Sparkle In The Rain, Real Life) but it's a nice solid record from them. it helps to be a Simple Minds fan to enjoy this album. Standouts: Different World, The Jeweler, Part 2, A Life shot in Black and White, Kiss The Ground, and Dolphins."
3,a collection of near misses,"Im 33, and have been a fan since ""Real Life"", baby. I prefer the variety of songs on ""Cry"" to ""Black and White"" and find the new release frustrating. With the exception of the brilliant ""Stay Visible"", most of the songs are too repetitive and don't have the power as those on ""Cry"" Even the finale ""Dolphins"" fails to deliver due to the repetitive nature of the song. Not surprisingly, the song evokes an expansive image of the ocean, yet the vista seems constrained and more like a lake.Sadly, all of the songs have moments have inspiration , but only a couple deliver in a way youd expect of Simple Minds.If you havent heard Simple Minds in a decade, skip this and check out Cry (4.5/5 stars). Three stars for ""Stay Visible"", ""Dolphins"" and good sections from the rest of the songs."
5,they are back on route again,"This album is a great offering and can be placed next to other classic Simple Minds albums such as their most commercial New Gold Dream. Again we are treated with good melody lines and Jimm Kerr sounds back in shape, we all can sing along again. Old fans should definite give them a new chance and listen to it , I am sure you won't be disappointed."
4,Simple Minds - Black & White 050505,"When you start the first track (Stay Visible) you hear the great sound of the 80's.Other tracks it's following that feeling with sometimes a little electro sound.The single ""Home"" was probable a good choice to come back with.But I think that some other tracks could make the same come back.After you hear the whole CD you don't have the feeling that you did getting something new, pity for them who searching that.For others who just like the Simple Minds a great CD."
5,The big picture,"In reading the Bible, it is easy to 'miss the forest for the trees'. Baxter's book is perhaps the most insightful and useful reference on 'what the Bible is all about'. This scholarly, yet extremely readable, work will be appreciated by both the new-comer as well as the accomplished Bible student. It provides a useful framework as to how the various parts of the Bible fit together, and helps clarify some of the more 'difficult' passages as they are viewed in their context of the whole. Currently out of print (hopefully only temporarily), this is the single most valuable book about the Bible I've ever read."
5,NICE!!,"This is is nice piece to add to the collection, very quick delivery. Nice big size so you can see the sign from far away.."
1,Over weight!,The information shows this bracelet weighs 14.5 pounds. I find that incredible and bet it's a mistake. I would not want to order and try to wear a bracelet that heavy!!Flo Philips
4,Convenient Entertainment,"Our toddler is 2 years old and after about 30 minutes or so he tends to get bored in our van. We always bring things to keep him entertained and occupied, but this Travelview by far is the best thing ever invented to make our trips more peaceful and our toddler much happier...and better entertained for sure!!! It is great and well worth the investment. If you look around online (and in stores), you wont get a bargain like this and you wont find something as durable either. We love it!!!"
3,Don't purchase for SUV,"I purchased this because the description indicated for use in an SUV or minivan. I drive a Mitsubishi Montero Sport and it was about three inches too wide to fit between the seats; therefore I had to return it. The Travelview was a great piece of equipment, I'm disappointed that it didn't fit!"
4,Good Entertainer for the kids,"Overall, we really enjoy this product. There are two flaws-we didn't receive the remote or any instrucion manual that we were supposed to and the plastic on the inside cracked as soon as we put it in :( The kids love it so that's all that matters to us."
2,"Problems, problems everywhere.....","I purchased the Travelview for the long car ride to Disney World with a 2 year old and a 6 month old. The Travelview is an excellent product, as long as it is working, which apparantly it doesn't for very long. After only using it for 2 months, the vcp began eating the tapes, rendering the unit useless... I LOVED the Travelview for the 2 short months that it worked..."
4,Great alternative to install,"We have twin girls (then 18 mons) facing a 13 hour drive for vacation - we have a minivan but did not get the dealer install drop down screan. After looking at all the alternatives, this worked great. Price is good. Install is easy. I prefer a tube to computer type screne since you can see it fine at an angle (twins...) and the size of the screne - 9"" verses the panel screne's 4.5"". The inside casing is cracked - hope it does not crack any more! (that's why only one star!)"
2,Something missing and not working,I just opened the box and I am very disappointed with the item for the following reasons:First noticed cracks in the case holding the TV.Second the TV and VCR would not play. I took the unit apart and found that the audio and video cable were backwards.Third - the remote is missing
3,Another solid melodic rock album from the pre-grunge 90's,"Bob Rock is best known for his role producing bands such as Bon Jovi, the Cult, and Metallica, but in 1992 he started up his own band Rockhead, producing, writing, and playing guitar on this self-titled debut album.Rockhead is your typical early 90's pre-grunge hard rock album. It's a straightforward melodic rock album with a slight blues flavor and arena rock production. It's not quite as polished as say Bon Jovi or Mr. Big, but not as sleazy as Junkyard or L.A. Guns either. Split the difference and you'll come close to Rockhead's (and more than a few other 1992 bands') sound. Rock provides some very solid guitar work to the album, but for my money is overshadowed by vocalist Steve Jack. Richie Sambora and Billy Duffy make guest appearances.This is a perfectly decent, but not particularly memorable rock album. If you love the commercial rock sound of the late 80's and early 90's, you'll probably enjoy Rockhead."
3,It's just ok,"I found the main character, Eleanor, to be cringe worthy. She was unpardonably awkward at times with no filter. For instance, she blurted out that she was the oldest virgin in her town before a guy with whom she had no real relationship. There was no reason to do that. I just cringed during that scene. The love interest, Cole, though, was ok. I think that the author tried to portray him as somewhat troubled and I understood his motivations for doing what he did. All in all, the book was just ok."
5,Excellent Picture,"I just set up my new home theater system. I have this 27A41 TV with a Toshiba 2150 dvd player using the Colorstream component cables. The picture on dvd is incredible, especially for a $... tv. I was impressed not only with the detail and resolution, but the richness of the color as well. The only bad thing about the TV is that the speakers are not that great. When I watched the first dvd on my new setup, the picture was so awesome, but the sound was not that great, so I decided to get a home theater in a box system, so the sound is not a problem anymore. The tv is definitely a great option if you want a sweet system while keeping the total cost of your home theater under $...."
2,Poor sound quality,"This set has good picture quality but the sound quality of the built in speakers are poor and tinny. You will need additional audio components for this to work in a medium/large room. However, the unit is not Dolby Surround compatible."
2,Not suitable for tall people,"This guy showed up in the gym at my office building. I was very excited to be able to do dips and chinups.First impression was this piece of equipment isn't going to last... it's not commercial quality.I'm 6'6"" and this machine is not built for tall people. The assist pad goes on an angle such that you slide off when you're at the bottom of a chinup, dip, etc. Putting a towel helps some but not enough. It's not tall enough to do hanging leg lifts. The arm padding feels cheap and doesn't provide enough near my elbows when doing regular leg lifts. The only thing that does fit me properly is the dip handle width.I gave this a 2 star just because I'm taller then the average person and wasn't sure how much it cost."
3,Awesome for 92-93.,"It's amazing how much I heard them in the early 90's, and then suddenly never again. This is a good sound of the times though, and almost holds up even now. For the most part it's dance/techno, but there's a few slower pieces too. The biggest and best songs here are ""Something Good"", which samples Kate Bush, and ""What Can You Do For Me"", which samples both Kiss and the Eurythmics. Everything else is good, just not as club-ready as those two were. If you like the genre, this is worth getting if you find it. There should be a few used copies between here and ""Utah""."
4,Best A/V quality for these 2 Eddie Murphy flix,"I was really surprised by the superb video quality of these 2 movies on bluray. Clarity and colors get a huge boost compared to the old DVDs. Granted it will never equal the glossy transfers of newer films on bluray but taking into account these films were from the 80s, these are the best they will ever get to look for quite some time to come. And the nude scene of Jamie Lee Curtis in her prime in total HD glory---worth every cent I paid.;)"
4,great movies,these are two classic movies that i wanted and for the price for blu-ray it was perfect. dvd's works great. Coming to america dvd was rattling around in the case before i opened it which sucks but dvd works perfect no issues. classic movies a must have
1,Flimsy and it died quickly,"I got this phone directly from Uniden and it died after 5 months use. Like the previous post, nothing in the troubleshooting section worked, and it was out of warranty (90 days), so in the garbage can it went. Also, the casing on this phone is pretty cheap... it looked to be in worse condition than my 7 year old Sanyo phone."
4,The programmable rings make the phone,It's a trip. You don't need to look at the caller ID. All you have to do is take a few minutes to program the memory dials and the ringers that go with it and your off and running. Now I know when twinkle twinkle little star is playing it's my mom.ON the serious side. The features are nice/functional and it is a great product for the price you pay.
1,It died in less than 6 months.,"It was a fine phone, while it lasted. After about 6 months, it worked only sporadically, then died altogether. I followed all the suggestions in the troubleshooting section of the manual, but nothing worked. I won't be buying another Uniden."
3,difficult reading,"This may be a very good book, but it did not meet my needs. The author has written dozens of books on the Middle East and Asia. There is little doubt that he is an expert on the subject."
3,Fathers and sons,"A prominent coach was once asked why it was that he thought black athletes were so dominant at the higher levels of professional sports. He replied that in his experience, black sportsmen were better because they trained harder and acted in a more professional manner. Furthermore, he suggested, the reason why he preferred to work with black athletes was that typically, they were involved in sports for a reason; to gain money and fame. ""Most of the white athletes aren't"", he added ""For the most part, they seem to me to be in sports because they're trying to sort out issues with their fathers"".Food for thought."
5,Out of Print ....TOO BAD AND NOT FAIR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great cd with many classic tunes ""No Time For Time, ""10,000 Words"" (which was also recorded by Ms. Dionne Warwick)I agree that if you can find this cd used, it is a keeper!!!!Peace & Love"
3,"Great,but not her best","I would give this cd 3 1/2 stars. Its Undeniably has good work in it and Brenda Is one of My favs.It goes without saying No Time for Time was great. Soul Talking was ok (I prefer Chaka Khans version),Matters of the Heart and 10,000 Words are keepers. My favorite was the duet between her and Bobby Caldwell,""Who Are You"".The rest of the album is just mediocre compared to what I generally expect from this musical genius."
5,Great tub,Made in North America (Mexico) and of nice quality. Gauge is thick enough to be a tool rather than just a planter. Everything I hoped it would be.
3,Unhappy customer,"I am very unhappy because, I ordered 2 wash tubs which were in stock and billed for two with no back order statement on bill. Even though Amazon says they will credit me back for the parcial order....I need the complete order since I am using the two tubs for their actual purpose of washing clothes...one to wash and one to rince. Now I am stuck with an incomplete set up and have to search again for another tub.."
3,I CAN'T STAND THE DVD HOLDERS!!!,"I just recieved the Magnum dvd's and already I have broken off 2 of those clips that say ""press here"". These dvd's are so stuck on those clips, that you end up having to bend your dvd while you press that center button and lift the edges of the dvd. Anyways, 2 of those 'press here' center buttons broke completely off while I pressed them while I tried to lift the dvd's. Very frustrating."
1,"Show is great, but the DVD's are AWEFUL!!!!!! Is there a ZERO Stars?","WARNING ... Watch these discs as soon as you get them so you can return them if they are bad. Don't trust that they have no visible scratches, I have discs that look perfect but when played have about 15 minutes that are unviewable on BOTH sides of the disc. Double sided discs are terrible quality, I don't think we have the technology to do this yet properly. The policy of a time limit at AMAZON.COM means you need to watch ALL the discs before I got a chance to watch more than the pilot episode, so when you order be sure you have about 22 hours to kill."
5,Universal ***Please Wake UP!!!!!****,Magnum pi was the best action show ever on TV!!! Hey Universal...what in the hell is wrong with you??? There are thousands of people just like me waiting to buy this series on DVD. You release shows that had a run of 2 years and you ignore a show that ran for nearly a decade. Please wake up from your coma and finally put this classic show on DVD.
5,Regars,Yesterday I received the product I bought. Excelent product and very good disposition from Amazon when the first product I bought lost it. Thank you very much.RegardsAriel.
3,Magnum P.I. first season,"I didn't watch Magnum when it was on TV primarilly because it just didn't interest me. I have since, become a huge fan of Tom Selleck; my wife too. But the Tom Selleck in Magnum is not the same guy we have come to so appreciate over the years. Quigley and Jesse Stone and other characters are more of what we have come to love. So Magnum is a disappointment."
5,Oh My GOD!!!,"Err, sit down Higgie Baby, take a chill pill.This was easily one of the best TV series ever made. In many respects it symbolized the vibrancy and optimism of the 1980s, following the dismal malaise that followed the Vietnam war."
5,At last!!,"I received my DVD yesterday and it is everything I had hoped. Each episode includes a synopsis and air date. The early episodes also contain the rare, original opening credits with the kitschy Ian Freebairn-Smith theme. This is usually dropped in syndication. Also, in addition to containing all of the episodes from the first season, there is a bonus disc. On it are the Simon & Simon crossver episodes and ""Echoes of the Mind"" parts 1 and 2. The Simon & Simon epidodes are never seen in syndication and ""Echoes of the Mind"" is a fan favorite from season 5. Way to go Universal!!"
5,Magnum Series 1,Enjoyed watching these over again. I look forward to getting more of the series some time in the future. :)
5,Good old times,In very few scenes (don't ask me wich one) the audio is not dvd quality an the video have the same drop of quality...get blurry.But...is a 30 years oldThis apply also to the 2nd season
5,Finally....,"I have been waiting for quite some time for Magnum to come out in DVD format, and I am not disappointed. My package arrived within two days of being ordered, and I promptly set out to watch the first four episodes. Like I said, I am not disappointed. The episodes appear to be in their original format, including the old Theme Score from the early seasons. Included with the original 18 first season episodes, are four more... The two Cross Over episodes with ""Simon & Simon"" and the two part episode with Sharon Stone ""Echoes of the Mind"".Each episode also includes the previews that were shown prior to the next episode. Although they are played right before the episode, they are a nice touch. There are no bonus features, but I am not bothered in the least.The format is full screen and dolby 2.0, and the DVD's are double sided. I have every episode on tape but the upgrade to DVD is well worth the money.Enjoy"
4,Magnum P I season 1,"Well if you loved the TV series how can you go wrong with this? It is so campy and the first episode is so good (""Don't look at the dogs work the lock. You looked at the dogs!"").If you love Magnum this is well worth the money."
1,Defective double sided dvds,"This is a great show with great writing and acting. Unfortunatly I had to purchase & return this 3 times (season 1). Once from Circuit City, twice from Amazon.The 1st disc freezes and skips and is basically unwatchable. I think Amazon should pull his item from its inventory and complain to the manufacturer. They should have never put this on a double sided dvd."
2,Be Warned!,"I received the Magnum DVD set as a birthday gift, and thoroughly enjoyed watching a favourite childhood tv show. My problem was with the discs, there are four discs each with a side A and side B. Side B on two out of the four discs did not work! Please, if you have received this DVD set review and ensure that all the discs work!"
5,Magnum P.I. a series built with strong characters,Well I think most have said what I agree with. Very few series come and go but have the staying power like Magnum. The cast built true relationships that showed on TV. Even after all of these years Magnum is still very popular. I am not looking forward to the movie since as of now Tom Selleck and the rest of the cast will not be involved. Brian Grazer is making a huge mistake.Anyway I just picked up the Universal DVD set of Las Vegas with James Caan and there was an insert stating that Season 2 of Magnum is coming on March 8th. I hope the transfer is a bit better but then again I guess its better than nothing.
5,MAGNUM ROCKS!,MY WIFE AND I GOT INTO MAGNUM DURING SYNDICATION RERUNS AND WERE LOYAL VIEWERS FOR 5+ YEARS. TO BE ABLE TO WATCH MAGNUM PI WHENEVER WE WANT IS FANTASTIC! WE OWN THE COMPLETE FIRST 4 SEASONS..
1,thanks for the nightmares....,"Lone star for being one of the worst TV series EVER. Horribly bad! The stupid 'staches, lame rainbow-bright helicopters, magnum's gay appeal, his ugly lame ferrari, the constant arguments w/ Higgins.Aaargggg!!Can I have part of my childhood back now please? What a waste. Believe it! P.I. is weak"
4,Magnum P I The Complete Sixth Season,"I have watched three of the DVD's so far and most are entertaing and the quality is good. However, the third one broke up a good bit and I had a problem watching it to the end. I enjoy watching Tom Selleck. He is my favorite actor."
5,second season april 12th,The second season will be released on april 12th. And will contain bonus episodes from knight rider and the A-team. So all you magnum fans get ready!
2,Hoping that new batches of discs might all work,"Two sides out of 8 have problems. The last side is unrecognizable as a DVD in any DVD player or computer, it is that bad. So it is all the media and not the program. Obviously Magnum PI rocks."
5,Great fun entertainment,"Surprised how well the first series stacks up after all these years. There's hardly a dud episode in here. We very much enjoy watching these DVDs, but the dobermans are tops! Plenty of them in this series."
5,Great portable body lotion,Long lasting body lotion that doesn't leave my skin with any irritation or oily residue. Perfect for healing your hands after a long winter or use every day to keep your skin feeling baby soft.
3,Met the need,"These were sent as a gift to women in prison. It seems to have met their need, although small."
3,It's alright,It's alright but it is a little bouncie and maybe a tad light for indoor soccer. The players do like the visibility.
2,Poor Investment,"I have had 2 of these bucks. When they are working, they are great. However, one of the buckets quite on me after one season. The other bucket stop working after 3 seasons. I also had a bird bath heater made by Allied Precision that also failed after one season. It's now the middle of winter I and I am once again looking urgently looking for bucket heaters."
4,Disturbing,This brief account of the life of Frances Farmer of Seattle is disturbing in many ways: the local reaction to her high school essay on God's death; the local treatment of her as a communist when she visited Russia; her abuse at the hands of Santa Monica police and the criminal justice system following a mere traffic stop; and her ultimate wrongful committals by her mother and the authorities to an insane asylum.The doctors and public officials responsible for the asylum Farmer was housed in should all have been criminally charged and convicted and sentenced to the same treatment she received!!!!!!!!
4,Excellent PDQ performance,"If you have never seen Peter Schickele (aka PDQ Bach) in performance before, you should see this one. The CD's are entertaining in themselves, but, with live performances, there are other visual jokes that are just as humerous as the musical. I have always enjoy ""The Seasonings"" (Schickele number 1/2 tsp), and would like to perform it. THis group did a great job. IT is a recording of a live performance, so the sound is sometimes a bit garbled. But, don't let that dissuade you from SEEING PDQ Bach as well as hearing him. Schickele is a genius in this genre, so enjoy it."
5,Classical -- With a Twist,"If you love classical music, but can enjoy a good parody, this is a concert for you. Having a good background in music theory comes in handy to truly appreciate the way Schickle has shifted keys, combined themes, etc. Having performed ""The Seasonings"", I understand just how difficult these pieces truly are. It's great fun."
5,Hilarious,"I saw the noble Professor in concert nearly 3 decades ago, and I'm glad to have finally found a DVD that has some of his on-stage humor. Maybe more perfomances (like perhaps the Stoned Guest...?) will show up on DVD"
3,"entertaining, but Drags here and there.","Much of the program is very clever, very entertaining...classically funny.The main problem for me is that the parts that do drag damage the overall enjoyment. Perhaps, the best approach is to not watch the entire program in one sitting."
4,"It reads like a suspense novel, but fiction it is not.","Confronting cruel mob mentality and irrationality of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the author's ability not only to survive but to escape and thrive shines through the drama. Although we worked together, the author so focused on the professional issues at hand that there were only whispers of his past.Skillfully woven among the details are messages of meaning at other levels, such as human rights, power of government, impacts of culture on individual behavior, individual strength, and hope for the future."
4,"Excellent, but not for undergraduates","As a 2nd year graduate student, I find myself referring back to this book constantly. The explanations of the output are excellent, along with the model APA-style Results sections. The included data sets and instructions have allowed me to teach myself many of the analyses that were missed in my classes. On the other hand, I got the book in an undergraduate data analysis class 3 years ago, and have to say, that at that time, it was all very much over my head. The book's explanations are way too dense and jargon-loaded for undergraduates, but if you've had 2 or 3 stats courses already, you should find this wonderful book extremely helpful."
2,an inexpensive machine,"was a real cheap machine. will get your espresso, foam your milk, but I can't say I I was sad it died within a year. Better than a steam machine, but there is better out there. Actually I have not had good luck with any haier product"
2,"Full Disclosure, Please!","Two stars for historical value only. The recording quality of this disc is horrendous, despite restoration, and is for die-hard theater buffs ONLY, virtually unlistenable for everyone else."
1,Credit card charged for items not in stock,"Amazon's site made no mention of the products not being in stock, charged my cc, and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered. My first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else, and my second call (upon not receiving a return call) revealed the real facts. Having a credit card charged for items not in stock is *not* cool. Beware."
1,Don't break the base antenna!,I called to order a replacement base antenna which only costs .97 but they have a minium order policy of 5.00 so in total it would cost about 12.00 to order this and I was told they can't tell me where else I can go buy it. The phone is great but their customer service is terrible!!!
1,uniden phone rating,the sound quality of this phone is shameful. my mobile phone produces a better connection.
2,Cardboard Chart,"This is easily damaged in the assembly process and the different parts should be plasticized as it created a lot of interest and students want to touch it as it encourages a more tactile learning and understanding which is great, but......."
2,sound is bad,"The minimal design is nice (there's not much but screen to see from the front), but with the speaker holes relegated to the back, the sound is bad."
5,Entertaining Nautical Fiction,"This is an excellent novel for those who love nautical fiction the likes of C.S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. Doctor Dogbody is like a Forest Gump extraordinaire of the early 1800's. So, ""Heave to"" nautical fiction fans for a humorously written historical adventure."
2,Not as good as i had hoped it would be,"""Johnny Hit and Run Paulene"" had always been a favorite song of mine by X, so I went and bought this and was very , very , very disapointed. I couldn't believe how bad this was , and i couldn;t believe it got so many good reviews. With the exception of ""Johnny Hit and Run Paulene"" , this is just terrible in my opinon ."
5,steam engine era,this was a great buy from amazon it was a brand new in box item for a great price. I will contiue to shop for other train items from amazom.troubledog2012
3,Some useful suggestions but also serious limitations,"The book features a good range of simple exercises to build up strength. But there is insufficient coverage on developing an adequate program of running and swimming, far too little for someone who might contemplate BUD/S training. Similarly, the section on nutrition is wholly inadequate. What is surplus to requirements, however, is the detailed description of each part of the obstacle course. The vast majority of readers would have no access to any such facility, so the entire section is of mere curiosity value. Overall, this book is fine up to a point, but leaves too many important areas neglected."
1,The book was boring and uninteresting,"From the unbearible beginning to the unfulfilling end, this book provided no interesting information whatsoever. Really, I should have stoppped reading it after the first ten pages, because reading this book was an abosolute waste of my valuable time."
3,Not that bad... really!,"Okay this movie was pretty bad, but then again we Westerners don't get much of the underlying text to Asian movies anyway!The best thing about this movie was the acrobatics of the hero. He was really skillful and pulled off the physical comedy well. Not one I'd recommend running and out and buying but it's definitely a rental for those who appreciate the physical skill of the martial artists."
2,A Triple Feature is Not Always a Good Deal,"My husband and I enjoyed watching Green Card years ago, so when I discovered ordering this triple feature cost much less than GC alone on Amazon, I thought it was a no-brainer, despite being unfamiliar with the other two films. Big mistake! Hope Springs is a mindless, plotless piece of drivel in which a couple of the main characters disrobe under the pretense of innocence and none of the characters is particularly likeable. Mumford is instantly forgetable once viewed. We would not have wished to have either in our personal DVD collection had we seen them first. I also find it inane to mix an R-rated film in with two PGs."
4,Bought specifically for Green Card,"My wife and I love Green Card, we saw it together when we were dating. We love Green Card. We have not even seen the other movies."
4,Works just fine.,"No issues yet. I am very happy with it. It was a gift for my husband, and he's very happy."
5,Great Sight,I've used this sight several times at the range. Very easy to dial in once it's attached and is accurate. Using it with both eyes open is a pleasure. The only caution that I have is that once you've attached it and put rounds down-range make sure that the mounting screws are still tight or it will pop off. I would purchase again.
4,The best,"Excellent sight, easy to mount & adjust. But, EOTech folks must have a 5-year retirement plan for their executives based on their prices and that's why only 4 stars."
5,Great optic at a great price.,"This was a really good purchase for my AR-15. Easy to zero, fun to shoot, and overall good quality product from EoTech for the price."
4,Service issues,"Scope was ordered and received in a timely manner. Scope meets and exceeds all expectatons. However, the scope cover was not shipped. When Optics Sales was contacted, first I was told that it wasn't part of the order, that you needed to order the kit. When I pointed out I did order the kit, I was told we are out of covers and we will mail it to you. 30 days later I am still waiting. As I have expressed to the folks at Optic' don't advertise what you don't have in stock just to snag a sale. Am in the serice and about to deploy, could have made the purchase elsewhere withouot the hassel and will in the future. The new word in todays world is customer service. Didn't happen here."
4,Good product but...,"Irecieved the product in a timley manner and it works fine, but it was to include a scope cover and was not in the package. I called Optic sale and have only recieved the run around for five weeks now. I WILL NOT DO ANY FUTURE BUSINESS WITH [...]"
5,Amazing holographic sight,"Easy to zero, easy to adjust. Don't know about battery life yet, but I chose this sight over the XPS model because I prefer AA batteries instead of the CR123As ... claimed 1000 hours at mid range brightness with a pair of AAs?If they do run out, I'm probably using some Energizer Lithiums to get them to last long.Very happy with my sight, currently mounted on an FN SCAR-L."
5,Nice Optic,"Classic EOTech sight. 65moa ring and 1moa dot look as cool as you think. The ring is made of little pixles, so its not just a hovering perfect circle, but if you're shooting the right way you wont even notice that. Downsides are it is a bit wider than the standard AR platform, and if you used the Magpul MOE handguards and MBUS its hard to operate the Power/bright and dimmer buttons. The EOTech will be as far forward as possible and the MBUS will be as far back as possible and it will be snug. At least on a standard AR15. I ran it this way for a good while, so don't be dissuaded, just don't expect to make easy changes to the dimmer if you have gloves on."
2,Blurry Reticle,"I read reviews before purchasing this item. They mentioned that the reticle was a bit pixilated or blurry. I went ahead thinking that for my use ( A Keltech KSG Shotgun ) it would be fine. WOW, the other reviews were not kidding. There were so many scattered random dots that Sort Of formed part of the outer Circle of the reticle it looked like an Etch-A-Sketch drawing. Very poor quality control and or engineering. The rest of the unit seems fine but the reticle made me wonder if this was a Chinese Knock off instead of a real one. I know someone who has a counterfit EOTECH ""same model"" and the reticle in mine looks no better. He paid $250 less for his."
3,tries too hard,"Kenneth Karpinski's little book is a quick read and has its better moments.But his humor is sarcastic, his tips are very basic, and the project has little or nothing to do with what *women* hate. They're simply matters of good taste and self-awareness. Men don't learn well by being made fun of. We carry enough weight already.This book makes a convenient stocking stuffer and is good for a few chuckles in that way. However the Rutledge Press 'Gentlemanners' series is more helpful if you really intend to elevate your game."
2,Why did they chose this title?,"Let me start by saying that this book is somewhat funny.The title makes no sense. The book is written by a man and has more to do with what is professional than what is fashionable. The title should have been ""Mistakes Men make that Employers hate."" It is a pretty good guide if you are looking for a job and don't know how to dress yourself. Otherwise, don't waste the money.The only reason I even gave it 2 stars was because of the humor."
3,beware,"I love gold! Unfortunately, the item pictured here is not what you get if you order. I ordred 2 of these and, as you can see that Goldmember pictured above features the 'smoke and a pancake' accessory. Both of the ones I got feature a gold box with a key in it in his hand. Overall, it's still cool, but a little disappointing."
4,Great songs from a great movie,"The album is what it says it is: a soundtrack. All of the songs you heard in the movie are here.I left off a star, however, because I really, really hate the version of ""The Flame Still Burns"" that's on here. It's basically the same song sung by Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy in the film, but they've add an unnecessary group of back-up singers to vomit over the last few minutes of the song. Utterly terrible, and it ruins what is otherwise a beautiful piece. I always have to stop or fast forward before they cut in."
4,"Good, solid phone--NOT Great, however.","It's everything a phone should be--clear, convenient, holds its charge well, etc.. I like the feel of the handset. However, the speakerphone .... It's in the base unit, so if you are dreaming of putting the handset down for hands-free use while you cook in the kitchen or whatever, dream on. Only one person can speak at a time with the speakerphone--if one person is on the handset and another on the base speakerphone (a common arrangment when my wife and I are phoning family), the speakerphone cuts off while someone else speaks. That is, you can hear them, but they can't hear you until everyone shuts up and waits a second or two for the speakerphone to turn back on."
1,Terrible phone,I bought one new. Terrible interference when using a headset. Returned/ replaced. Terrible interence persisted. Terrible phone- stick to the 900 mhz.
3,I returned the lastest version-- the Tru3485DSS,"I returned this phone as it had an annoying echo/reverb sound when speaking into it. Listening to others speaking to me--well--they sounded great. But when I spoke there was this nasal, echo, sound of my own voice--I just could not stand to hear it!!!! Others listening, had no such sound. Quality to them was great. I bought a panasonic KX-TG2563 (which the sound quality is the best!). Problem solved! But this phone does not have an answering machine--I use a separate machine--as I did not like the quality of the panasonic answering machine system. The two I bought (KX-TG2583 and KX-TG2670N) had a ""grown sound"" between messages, when playing the messages back? I returned both."
5,Best cordless phone I have ever had.,"Have had this phone for 8-10 years, and have never had a phone this good. The only drawback is that the answering machine comes on after the fourth ring. Sometime it's hard to find that soon. Would give it 5 stars."
