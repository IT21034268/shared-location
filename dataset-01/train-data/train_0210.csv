3,"Interesting, but some characters not well-developed","The author had good ideals; however the characters could have been developed more. For example, Janeen, Veronica, and Debra could have been flushed out more. Also, the author appeared to rely too heavily on the thesaurus. However, I would share the book with a friend. Overall good read."
1,Horrible!,This author didn't make black men or women look or sound very good at all. She seemed to imply that black male/female relationships are futile. A self-hating odyssey of an confused black woman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Perhaps she should get to know more black men.
1,Just say No!!!,"If you reading this review before you buy this book, DON'T DO IT!!! Save your money! The book was awful. Disappointed is a mild word to use. Our book club read the flap and thought the book would describe us (bold, strong and spicy)...we changed our book club name after we read this book. The only good thing about this book was the artwork. I guess it is true..you can't judge a book by it's cover."
1,I was totally displeased with this book!!!!,"I read this book last November thinking that I would find something interesting from a fresh, new voice in African American fiction. I was very disappointed as I read further into the book. There were too many characters in the story that I was left wondering about at the end of the book. However, even though I did not enjoy her first novel, I think that it will be interesting to see what her second novel will be like."
1,"The reviews made it sound Oh, so Good, but it wasn't.","I must agree with every reader who gave this book one star. I was put off reading about the Armani, Bill Blass, Chanel etc., etc., etc. chi-chi stuff. Who cares who wore what from whom and what color it was, I wanted something to get interested in. Skipping around with no end in sight is maddening. I was left cold in the attempts to create characters who went no where. They should have been more fully developed than they were. It took me forever to finish this book and then I found myself skipping whole pages to do so. I'm sorry Delorys, it really could have used some more work."
2,Too much soap like a soap opera.,This book was okay even though I had a difficult time getting into the read. Some of it was too Hollywood and pretentious. Aletha's and Desiree's parent's were quite humorous and should have had more of a role in the story. I would have enjoyed the book more if Ms. Welch-Tyson had not left the other characters hanging.
2,Not The Greatest!!!,"I feel that the author included to many characters whose lives where entwined. Although, I finished reading, I would not recommend to anyone. Keep trying Delorys!!!"
1,Still Waiting for the Headliner!!!!,"This book kept me reading for ""that big moment"" that never came. I finished the book feeling like I just wasted several days of my time. It is not at all what I expected. There was no excitement but the author kept making it seem like she was getting to the apex but never developed the story that far. This was merely a collection of short stories that really had no point.Better luck next time."
3,Okay but could be better!!!,"I read an awful lot of books in my spare time. I felt as though this book was a waste of my time overall. I'm sure with more practice that Mrs. Welch-Tyson will improve. It generally takes me 3 days to read a 300-page novel, this was one was reasonably short and it took me a week. The characters lacked a lot of something,I just can't figure out what that something is yet. Good luck next time."
5,Good Girls Finish Last,"What an awesome book. From page one to three-hundred plus this book is a page turner.It all starts with Anna's wild, uncontrollable behavior that gets her sent to Camp Archstone on Andros Island. Everything is mechanical in this wilderness camp for bad girls. Every girl has a story to tell and Anna doesn't know who she can trust. On a camping trip something goes horribly wrong and the real adventure begins. The girls must fight for their lives and the reader feels as if they are truly a bad girl. There are so many different scenarios, and secrets living within the island. The whole time Anna has flashbacks of her own secret that she's hiding. Who will make it to safety, if anyone?This book was a great read. The ending wasn't as strong, it was kind-of sappy in my opinion. Other than that, this makes for a great summer read. I would say it's for the young adult 18+ crowd."
4,An Adventure in Survival,"When I first got the book, I thought this would just be a book I would read as I got to it, but when I would take it with me to work, and I enjoyed it very much. Once I got through the first few chapters, I was able to finish the book in a week. I liked all the suspense and the characters of the girls. It was crazy to think of all the pain and experiences the girls had to go through, but it all seemed realistic. I think this book reaches the teenager and women community. I recommended this book to one of my friends to read as well."
4,Fun and Thrilling,"Like others said, this book really does read like a movie. At first, I thought it was stupid, like, ""who wants to read a book about some bratty girl and her bratty new friends?"" but I was pleasantly surprised. It's different than most of the books I've read-- It really has a lot of suspense and is a big thriller! I'd reccomend it to girls (and guys) who like action/adventure books and movies about other strong girls. One problem I had with it was the location of the island. I didn't know there could be an island off the coast of Florida so uninhabited, but... Overall, a good read."
4,Madness,"This makes a very good coffee table book. Everyone looks at it twice, before smiling and changing the subject. a"
3,Too Big,"This bank has a larger capacity to hold more money, but 24"" is too big. Real bowling pins are only 15"" tall..."
5,Love it!,I can't wait to surprise my son with this Bowling Pin Bank @ his bowling party. The guests will have enough room to sign their names and my son can also store his money in it. And this company shipped super fast. Received it within days of placing the order. Thank You!!!
4,A great resource for my family and teenagers,"I loved all the actual stories they gave. I can see that these guys have 'walked' with a lot of teens and know how to help make a change in their lives. I can already see that their advise has made some differences with my kids.I also loved the fact that they use a spiritual approach to inspire and coach teens. There's nothing more powerful to bring out the best in teenagers.One suggestion however, is that parent's are going to have to be involved with the process to get the best results with their teens."
5,good quality,"good quality, easy to work with.good quality, easy to work with.good quality, easy to work with.good quality, easy to work with.good quality, easy to work with."
1,Save your money!!! Doesn't work with Sony Batteries,I bought this unit thinking it would solve my travel charging needs. Wrong. I have tried three Sony OEM batteries and the charge light comes on but doesn't charge. I have bought the Sony travel charger since. Wish I had done this first and saved the $40 for the Digipower paper weight.
1,Couldn't even charge a Sony battery,"Out of the box, ours would not hold a Sony battery in place in order to charge. One would have to physically press it against the charger in order for it to make contact. Even if the contacts worked, the tabs to hold the battery in place would not hold the battery when it was plugged vertically into the wall. I don't even think wrapping it in tape would work since the tape would relax and the contact would be lost."
1,I DON'T RECOMMEND IT,When the program arrived I immediately attempted using it. Within 3 hours of using the program I was unable to load my video onto my computer with sound. I am almost completely sure I was doing it correctly because I am experienced with similar software and thoroughly read the users manual. To make matters worse my (computer) system shut down (what it said was) due to new installed hardware.Do not do the same thing I did: I read the negative reviews and thought I would give it a try anyway.
2,Not BAD but I'd recommend trying something different,"Some reviewer said ""Easy to use interface, well balanced features, and stability stability stability... Formerly MGA, now Roxio (that's to bad)."" What a load - probably from the Roxio company. I have the program and while I haven't had as many problems running it as some of the other people who have reviewed this software, this is anything but stabile. It's basic and a few of the features would not work no matter what was done. This is for the beginner and depending on what your intended output is, this could be great or it could be a real pain (i.e. simple mpeg movies - great. DVD or web - a REAL pain).Don't part with your money if you expect too much but I still use this depending on what kind of an output I'm looking for."
1,Save your Money,This product don't work. I did everything correctly and never could get it to work. No Help from Roxio either. Save your money.
1,MONEY WASTER,"They brag about having the chroma key or whatever. But there is one problem, you have to have the perfect lighting and all that stuff. Otherwise only a few specles change. It looks so easy on the website but it is not. If you wanted to get it like I did just to make a few small ""productions"" such as and have little to no budget THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I tried to use it for a school project and it is a total waste of time and money. I tried for an hour to get the right lighting but it never worked. This one is way more confusing then the first one also. This software is not worth the money. Sure some things are good on it, but if you want to use the chroma key and you are not good with lighting such as myself, I really feel this product is not for you"
4,Excellent Starting Point in the History of the Jews,"If you are wanting to expand your knowledge of the history of the Jews, this is a good book to begin with. It will give you a detailed overview (without getting bogged down in minutiae). The only drawback is that it was written in the 1960s, and while it says that it was updated in 1994, the updates did not (and could not due to space constraints) do justice to the upheaval and turmoil that has occurred in the decades since it was origninally written.A slightly newer history that might serve as well is Paul Johnson's A History of the Jews (1998). For an overview of Islamic history, you might check out Karen Armstrong's Islam."
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited about this book, but I was very disappointed. Writing about a religious community in a secular way is very awkward. The writer has to fall back on specious claims to justify what happened(he will later say""Oh yeah, the relgious people believe this...) but the focus seems to be on secular atheism. He also throws in something out of nowhere about Darwinism for what reason I don't know. I am not a Christian, and I am not very familiar with the Christian church and history, and I found his repeated references to Paul and the church(pretty much at every significant point) confusing. This book was a real let down for me."
4,Good general survey but needs to be supplemented with detail,"This is a good, accurate book. For those with little knowledge of the subject, it is a good start; however, it oversimplifies and overgeneralizes in many areas. I would suggest that a reader of this book supplements his background with more detailed studies of the various topics."
4,Not collectible (anymore),"Purchased this through a zShop. One minor nitpick, be aware that despite the fact that the description says that there were a limited number of copies released and that each copy is numbered, there were in fact TWO editions of this album -- each with their own ""limited numbering"" -- released, and what you are likely getting now, as I did, is the second edition, which is printed into the side of the box cover (the first one apparently sold out very quickly after this was released).Still, if you go through one of the third party sellers, you can get a *great* price on this album now, I saved over 75% off the list price, so I can't complain too much. Just don't think you are going to get this at an amazing markdown price and then be able to sell this for hundreds of dollars later, and if you order a copy marked ""collectible"", BE SURE to ask the seller if it is in fact the first edition!"
3,Some good stuff in there.,"I love these musicians and they came together to make some great music. The more ""pop"" radio stuff is the best on the CD's. The other stuff has it's goods and bads. To me, the Petty stuff is the best and the Dillon stuff is the worst. However, as a group, they are good and the Wilburys slant is good. I wish there was more on the DVD. It pretty much covered only the making of the first CD, however, if you are a fan of any of these musicians, you will love it. I recommend getting it. It is a good buy, but the songs range in diversity, so you may not like all of them."
5,"Vol.1, one of the best albums ever!","Traveling Wilburys, Vol.1, is without a doubt one of the top rock,or pop, albums in rock music history! The lyrics are sharp and smart. The performances are all first rate. It is an album that you will want to listen to from beginning to end, then listen to again! I am not a big fan of any of the individual performers, but here they come together with an album that is very special. That said, I have never listened to the second cd, volume two. From what I have read, though, it is a notch or two below volume one in quality. I gave the set five stars based upon Vol.1. Volume 1 is that good! The price for the set is a bit steep, so I can't say go buy it. If I had listened to volume two, perhaps I could say buy it. Forty dollars is a lot to pay for one album. For what it's worth, I have a couple of remastered sets put out by Rhino Records that I am very happy with. Peace!"
3,Who Was In The Band? The Chicks?,"The DVD was really the only reason to get this set. I had the originals when they were released. The sound is a bit better on these but who really cares? As for the bonus tracks, a total waste of time.They missed a lot of potential tracks which were overlooked as well as a ""B"" side. They could have even padded out the rest of the CD's with the 12"" mixes. Nevertheless, they put Olivia Harrison in charge with Roy Orbison's widow assisting & this was the result! Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan & Tom Petty should have had the say so on this one, not the widows. After all, who played in this band? Enough Said!"
4,newest favorite,This was purchased as a gift for a friend . His wife says it gets air play and video play at least every other day . It seems to be his new favorite pass time . It was a random thought after Roy Orbison's Black and White night which he plays often . Price was excellent and shipment was the fastest that I have had with Amazon . Thanks for an excellent new pass time .
5,The best of all!!!,"This is the best cookbook of all. I am NOT a vegetarian but often forget while browsing through this book. Every page hass pictures of the dishes AND of the preparation instructions so if there's something you've never heard of or have no idea how it should be done, you're can be safe from making big mistakes."
1,Terrible,"This cookbook is poorly organized, and the recipes are unsatisfactory. The ones I have tried ranged from lacking in flavor to inedible. It has been a total disappointment."
5,very nice,"citaozinho & chororo as they where known in Brazil, or Jose y durval in Spanish, this is the best ever disc of the meninos do brazil. My favorites songs, cowboy do asfalto, bom dia, nuvem de lagrimas y evidencias are the very best song of this singers of the brazilian country music."
4,a woman's viewpoint of early New England,"For historical reasons, this book is interesting. The author was a woman who wrote in 1704 of her travels in the New England region of North America. When this was largely still raw frontier.We get a first hand account of colonial life, apparently uncensored. Many aspects come thru her narrative. Including the presence of slaves. Her descriptions of them and their experiences and duties, at least as perceived by her, are rather neutral. She does not condemn slavery but accepts it as a natural order of things. It is perhaps this casual acceptance that can be the most jarring feature of the book, to the contemporary reader.In passing, you might also appreciate that white women then had a fair amount of freedom. Less than white men, but not oppressed or constricted as some women today are, in some Muslim nations."
2,Could have been better,"This film was billed as being a monster film but it realy plays out as a jungle film from the 40's.The monster effects are adequate for a ""B"" film of the era but the story needs a lot of work.If you want to see a jungle movie,this is for you.But if you are looking for a good 50's monster film,this is NOT for you!"
3,HUGE wasps.,"This movie is O.K. It's about some rocket full of wasps on an experiment. Then, the rocket crashes in Africa. The wasps get mutated by space radiation and grow abot 100 times their original size. Let's get to how good the movie is. The wasps rarely get shown. A dissapointment for fans of old Sci-Fi movies like me. The movie is also slow moving (so many scenes of the characters walking). It also gets of track at times. This is an O.K. 3 star flick."
2,Competent acting & effects don't help - it's just boring.,"I've always been a fan of old sci-fi flicks, even if they're corny with bad special effects, even if they're so bad they're funny, like Ed Wood films. Some of my favorites are The Monolith Monsters and Panic In Year Zero. I'm sorry to say this one is just downright boring. The acting is good, and the special effects are certainly better than some other 1950s B-movies, so there's not much to poke fun at. The idea is good in the beginning - a satellite crashes in the jungle, and a Wasp on board was exposed to radiation, making it grow giant. But most of the movie follows the scientists on their trek through the jungle to find it, and is no more than a pointless safari movie, like those old black and white Buster Crabbe films. They finally do get to some monster fighting, but by that time it's hard to keep paying attention. I'll give'em two stars mainly for effort."
2,"No, Green Hell is not about eating bad Mexican food","This film truly stretches the limits of filmmaking! Just how much footage can you steal from another movie (in this case, 1939's Stanley and Livingstone) and still call it your own? Wasps return from space, crash land in Africa and terrorize a population of several!That buzzing sound you hear isn't wasps, it's the rest of the audience snoring. Kinda fun, though."
1,Truely a Green Hell,"As I buff of the ""oldies"" of filmdom, I must admit this is perhaps the worst of them all.Stock footage of many jungle flicks, tons of talk and in about the last 15 minutes we get treated to the superimposed plastic wasps that eventually get over shot with see through sceens of an erupting volcano. Sitting through of about 70 minutes of this movie is truly........."
3,Monster From Green Hell: a MUST SEE!,"Typical 50's sci-fi plot of laboratory insects being sent into orbit, and returning to earth. These particular wasps land in Africa. Lots of talk and clips of giant plastic bugs, this really hard to find video is a must for any sci-fi (cheesey or not) fan."
3,IMAGE DVD!!!!!,The print on this Image DVD is quite good. But they really screwed up big time by not including the color footage for the ending of the film. Look for the hidden trailers.
3,A good biography and nothing more.,"I'll be brief since one reviewer elucidated my points quite well.There's no doubt that Taslima Nasrin will go down in history was one of the greatest writers the south Asian community has even produced. She has clear vision on contemporary issues within the south Asian world. Her recent novel is of course a ""magnum Opus""that will be remembered by many. My only contention is that she tends to have a rather fervid tendency to over-generalize excessively. At times her statements about Islam in the book contradict her statements in speeches and other prints. Her critique of religion regurgitates old-fashioned arguments that stymies the reader( at least this reviewer). A good biography indeed. However, don't use it as a critique or religion."
4,Good product,The product is good. We have been used it for more than 3 years now. We will continue to use it.
3,Normally an Amazing product,"Normally this is the only conditioner I use. I love REAL Kerasilk. The product I received smells totally different and is as thin as water. My hair is still soft but its not as manageable, as it normally is with what Ive purchased at the Salons. I will spend the extra money next time to get the real thing."
3,Not as good as Morrocanoil Intense Hydrating Mask,"I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Morrocainoil Intense Hydrating Mask. This product has a watery consistency and works just ok on my very dry, color treated hair. For really hydrated locks, I am going to have to spend the extra money on the Morrocainoil products. I tried the small size of this produce, which was only about $8 on Amazon, so it is worth the try because everyone's hair is so different."
5,Perfect!,These help roomba keep my floors free from all the cat hair that 3 cats can produce!! I love it!
3,RoBo filters for Robo 400 machine,"The filters are very nice, look great, delivered on time, nice looking product. The only problem that I have is that they are the wrong filters. I ordered filters for the Robo 400 these filters are for he Robo 4910 they dont fit this Robo 400 machine. NOT WHAT i ORDERED. In trying to make areturn I was informed not returanable.David Hendricks"
1,Not iRobot filters!,"When I was looking for Roomba 400 replacement filters I came across two listings on Amazon; this one, for replacement filters by iRobot and another, replacement filers by Duogreen.I chose to go with the iRobot ones even though they were a few dollars more at the time because I wanted to make sure I was getting a quality product. However, I did not receive iRobot filters! I received the Duogreen filters. The seller (iOttie) is selling the same filters on both listings, advertising them as different products, and charging different prices.The filters are not the same quality as the ones from iRobot. Next time I will pay a few dollars more and but from the iRobot store."
5,Great price!,"These were half the price of ordering off of the iRobot website and the same thing. They are a great product and were a great deal, thanks!"
5,Replcement Filters work as advertised,These will last a very long time. I used one to replace a filter that had worn out. These are good to have on hand.
3,ok,The only filter for my model of roomba. Works fairly well. I have to change it maybe every two months. I wish they were sold in more stores. If they ever stop making these I will be out of luck seeing as though the roomba would not work well without them.
1,poor,"All of the online sites that I researched looking for iRobot Roomba 4910 replacements filters sold them in a package of three and the picture of the items sold through your amazon site showed three replacement filters, but the package that I received only held two filters.I will not purchase items from that company again."
1,Overpriced Necessity,"These little filters are a must for the Roomba. But they are grossly overpriced on anybody's website for what they are; about 3 square inches of filter fabric sandwiched into a specialized plastic frame. There is not an easy way to just replace the fabric due to the design. So Roomba has engineered a very pricey maintenance part. As soon as our Roomba dies, that's it. It's not worth the high maintenance. And replacement batteries.....? Forget it!"
3,Roomba filters,"The only complaint I have is cost: for 3 replacement filters you pay $15.00, with shipping. $5.00 apiece seems kinda steep for a product that probably costs $0.50 to make.."
3,Delivery of Roomba replacement battery and filters,"The battery was easy to install but there were no instructions. The battery works great and is all I anticipated. The filters meet expectations.Delivery of the product is another issue. It is rated with 0 stars -- minus 1 star if possible.The product was delivered more than 1 week after the delivery date provided. The shipping notice arrived with an estimated date and the product disappeared from the tracking site after being within a few miles of my home, showing up 3000 miles away a few days later. Amazon never answered either of the 2 messages I left about the delivery. If I had not be satisfied with previous orders I would never go back to Amazon for another purchase.Totally unacceptable experience with Amazon."
3,"I love Gooseberry Patch, but","If you're a real gung ho Christmas person you might like this book. However, if you already own a lot of Gooseberry Patch books (like I do) you may be disappointed. There are lots of repeated ideas and recipes. Maybe not exactly the same but extremely similar to those in other Gooseberry Patch books. Be cautious if you're a collector."
5,Another Golden Gooseberry,"For those of you who are familiar with the Gooseberry Patch Co. series, you will not be disappointed with this great cookbook. For those of you who are not familiar with it, what are you waiting for? This series (as well as Holidays at Home specifically) has recipes that are so easy to use, it doesn't matter if you're Julia Child or a 20's male bachelor (heh heh), it's easy to make everything in here. And it's delicious!While I feel this particular volume doesn't separate itself from the rest of the series, that is not at all a bad thing. It still has the recipes, memories, and ideas that they all have, and you're bound to enjoy it! Plus I'll plug the Old Fashioned Country Cookies title from this series. It's simply amazing.Happy cooking!"
2,New Creation Realities,"Dear SirsI was very unhappy with the condition the book was in. The first few pages fell out of it's binding. And there were sentences high lighted with a marker on many of it's pages. I paid full new book prices for a very used book. I was not a happy camper with this one book out the four I ordered from you.Yours truly,Richard Hanson"
3,"An oldie but not a ""goodie"" for me!","This was a required text book for a college course I'm working on and I could hardly get through it. If it wouldn't have been ""required reading"" I would have never finished it.If you like works dated in the late 1800's or early 1900's you may like this book. It seemed to me like it might have been quite a few sermons compiled together to make the book.On a positive note, there is a lot of Scripture throughout the book and Kenyon does bring out deeper revelation to some basic Scriptures."
3,Rhubarb,"Rhubarb is in hardcover, a very very ancient, yellow-paged relic of H. Allen Smith's salad days. I was pleased with delivery time and the book."
2,Rhubarb Falls Short of Smith Work,"Although Rhubarb became H. Allen Smith's only book-to-movie effort, his fiction lags behind his nonfiction. The plot is scattered between a millionare feline and a cast of hopeless charecters. If Rhubarb is the only book of H. Allen Smith's you read, please try some nonfiction before giving up all hope."
4,Hidden Secrets video,"Found this to be an excellent video detailing the lives of several individuals, and their interconnectivism. I did not like the negative image of Christianity that one individual portrayed withher harsh negative responses but in the end she came to be shown where she needed to change as well as another person totally needed a lifestyle change.Overall it was great and I recommend it. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise."
5,HA HA......,"very funny and halarious. David ar white (and his wife) are two of my favorite actors. They are simply funny and a wonder to watch. i enjoyed David as always. This was a story about destiny and learning how to walk in the light of the Lord and not in our own ways. The Lords ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts.this movie proved how some differnent people with the help of the Lord can get along in some shady circumstances.Funny, yet encouraging and uplifting ;)"
5,Amazing movie for Teens and Parents!,"This is a film about a weekend spent between life long friends and the ""secrets people keep"" even from each other! As a comical twists come in and out, old relationships resurface and unsettling feelings arise all while all in town for the weekend for a funeral. It's not what people expect from Christian dramas, this is truly amazing! Great cast, very talented and the soundtrack alone will have you buying this movie. It's an amazing Christian drama with an all star cast. After we watched it 1 X we begin a search to own it, and we can't watch it enough. Highly recommend everyone check this out if you've got teens ( NOT RECOMMENDED UNDER 15, PLEASE it's very intense) PLEASE watch with them!"
4,You Have to Check Out Wildflower!,This song is hot. Do Ya'll Wanna makes you wanna just get up and dance plus she doesn't sound like any of those other female rappers out there. She's completely different and she commands respect. She has another song on the other side which is hot too called If You Had to Rap N'ked. Check it out! It's worth the money.
4,Irish in America,A wonderful presentation of O'Neill and his work. It is remarkable for someone to produce his masterpieces after he had already been awarded his Nobel prize. O'Neill was obviously an extremely complex and complicated genius of the theatre. I would quibble a bit that more could have been presented about O'Neill's relationships with wives and children.
4,"Looks good, but cannot test fit.","Good cleavage and smooth under tight tops. Unfortunately, not being in a store means you either order one of every size and send back a bunch, or live with your best guess."
1,Do Not Buy; Said and Chomsky are Pathetic,Any book that includes articles by Edward W. Said and Noam Chomsky is NOT worth buying. Save your money.
4,Down dirty blues,"I own a copy of this vinyl, but would love to have a CD. I guess I will have to rip it myself.Seems to be rare now but if you get a chance....Check out ""Tobacco Road"". The best version of the song I have heard.Plodding, Slow, Bluesy, Nasty Guitar. Mean vocal."
5,UN BARROCO POR DESCUBRIR,"Este es un agradable encuentro para todo aquel que quiera conocer la magnífica obra del compositor barroco cubano Esteban Salas. El trabajo meritorio de la joven agrupación de musica antigua que, junto a la investigadora Miriam Escudero, ha ido recuperando las partituras de este importante músico caribeño es merecedor de elogio. Aunque otros interpretes han grabado obras de Salas (específicamente el coro de cámara Exaudi), no sin éxito, esta es quizá la oportunidad ideal para conocer la música del cubano en todo su esplendor. Los instrumentos de época y el cuidadoso trabajo de los solistas vocales nos adentran en el mundo musical sacro del Santiago de Cuba del siglo XVIII. Loable es también la participación del coro de la Catedral de Metz, que bajo la dirección motivada y precisa de Teresa Paz, brilla junto a Ars Longa en este disco que no debe obviar ningún amante del barroco musical americano."
4,"Engaging writing, fun heroine, but...","I read this book in one sitting, which speaks well for the pacing and the writer's voice. There's not much original about this marriage of convinience tale but Claybourne tells it with plenty of wit and humor. Melisande is a fun and endearing heroine. William is missing some important details - why did he run away to America and such.I'll hold on to my copy of this book for now and be happy to lend it to a friend, but I won't fret if it doesn't come back."
2,Not so bad and not so good either,This book read like a Johanna Lindsey book. Alot of cutesy stuff but kind of boring and dry. Not very sensual.
4,A Surprise! What a delight!,"This is my first book by Ms. Claybourne and I loved it. I am definitley going to order more. It's always great when looking for a new author, you find a book you can't put down. Keep them coming!"
5,Good Driving Jam's......,"Love his music, this is a kick ass CD. His guitar work is so crisp and clean, I love the sound. If you ever get a chance to see him live, you will not be disappointed.."
1,"save a little, lose a lot","Reasonably decent information, but this is like doing surgery on yourself - you can do it, but you might not like the results. I met a woman several years ago who saved $200 by doing her own divorce and lost a quarter million in her husband's retirement. Use at your own risk."
4,helpful and informative,this book gives you all the legal information you would ever need to obtain a divorce in north carolina. definitely for a person who likes to know what they are entering into and doesn't just take a lawyer's word for it.
5,A sweet little folktale,"I read this book to all of my kids, but my daughter liked it better than my boys did. It's a corky, cute little tale, about a butterfly who thinks her beloved mouse friend has been eaten by a fish. Out of this comes a story that follows the same format as ""There was an old lady who swallowed a Fly."" This happened, then this happened, then this, etc. It's a zany little book, especially at the end. It has a happy ending. There are 26 actual pages, not counting the cover page and dedication page. There are 5 pages of full color illustrations included in the 26 pages. The illustrations are bright and lively. It's probably 1st grade level, maybe second. Young children who hear the book several times will be telling this story, I'm sure. I'm also sure they'll want to hear it again."
3,Origional quality,"The origional quality of the filming of this story is horrible. There are plenty of movies out there that are older yet far better. Also, the telling of the back story that doesn't exist in the play, but only become known to us through the dialogue is so much better. Ibsen could write extremely well and his work does not need to be revised."
4,Good for an old computer,"This is excellent software, I've used it and it's very powerful. For the price it is a good buy if you have an older (pre-Leopard) Mac OSX. This software DOES NOT WORK ON LEOPARD nor SNOW LEOPARD. But it's still good stuff. If you want something modern, try FCP (Final Cut Pro)."
2,"OK movie, but terrible DVD quality","I have been a Rutger Hauer fan since Ladyhawke and Blind Fury, so after reading the plot and some reviews of Beyond Justics, I assumed it would be a pretty good movie. Oh boy was I wrong. The movie itself is barely OK, some good action scenes, but a pretty weak plot and the action scenes looked as if they were shot in the 70s and not in the 90s. But the quality of the DVD was terrible. The cover was cheaply done, not even printed right, and the DVD quality was grainy, worse than copying VHS to DVD, and the sound was horrid. It's beyond me how amazon.com can sell such a low quality product. Keep your VHS if you like the movie."
4,Beyond Justice - The Best Family Movie,"The movie Beyond Justice is a great movie for everybody to see. For anybody over the age of 10 should be able to understand the meaning of this video. I have received a sneak preview of the movie from a company that advertises it. If you like comedy , family , action movies with out violence then this is the movie. So buy this movie right away for yourself or a family member it would be a great gift. A AWESOME MOVE !!!"
2,THIS AIN'T REALLY THAT GOOD OF A MOVIE,"A WEALTHY WOMAN [CAROL ALT] SENDS A TOUGH MERCENARY [RUTGER HAUER] TO FIND HER SON. MOVIE TAKES TOO LONG TO GET STARTED AND THE SCRIPT IS FILLED WITH FLAWS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE HAS A DECENT CAST, THIS MOVIE FAILS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE. FANS OF RUTGER HAUER DESERVE A BETTER RUTGER HAUER MOVIE THAN THIS FORGETTABLE MOVIE. AT LEAST OMAR SHARIF GIVES A GOOD PERFORMANCE AS AN ARABIAN MAN."
1,Do not be fooled by the positive reviews,"I am quite sure that this is the worst action movie I have ever seen. Rutger Hauer is fair in it. Omar Sharif is good in it. Even these quality actors could not save this pantload. The sound was awful, The plot was almost nonexistant and full of more holes than a seive. I am shocked anyone could find this film entertaining. Luckily it has a very nice black plastic case, so it is not a total loss. I put my copy in the trash after I broke it. I would hate to think I had subjected the trashman or anyone else to this kind of vapid, tedious, film"
3,Purple Martin House,"I love the looks of the house. It is too late this season to attract the purple martins, so I don't know if they will like it next year. The biggest problem with this is building it. It took me 8 hours to put it together. (I do have long nails and I was doing it myself) If I could have purchased this already put together, I would have paid an extra $50.00 for it. It would have been worth it."
2,Too many pieces and assembly time is extensive,"I'm disappointed at how many pieces there are and how many hours (yes, plural) that it takes to assemble. The plastic perches keep popping out. I just bought the house with two floors. I had hoped that a piece of thinwall conduit would suffice for the post since I don't really care if it telescopes. The additional post is another $50. The mounts in the house are tapered and a standard piece of conduit doesn't seem like it is going to work. If I had it to do over again, I would leave this one alone."
1,Piece of Junk,"Don't buy it! It was very difficult to put together, taking 2 home maintenence teachers 2 hours. If the house gets invaded with other birds, it is almost impossible to remove the nest material without completely disassmebling the entire house. You cannot open the front without unscrewing the attachment to the next box. (I will probably have to disassemble the entire house to clean at the end of the season.) The perchers fall off and I have yet to figure out a good way to secure them--it will be raining baby purple martins. The two levels don't stay together well so the lower level tenants might get rained on. The cupola does not stay on so it had to anchored with a screw after this was discovered--naturally after it was up on the pole.I have another house by a different manufacturer that is sooooo much easier to work with. Don't be fooled by the cute appearance. Cheap material and bad design are simply not worth it!"
3,Heath 12D Aluminum Martin House,"First the good news. We put up the Martin house and the Martins are already moving in. When this house is completed, it makes for a very nice and attractive house. Now for the bad news. This house comes out of the box in lots, and I mean lots, of pieces. Some of the pieces are quite small and you have to be careful not to cut a hand or finger in the assembly process. The nuts and bolts are also tiny and have to be inserted in very tight spaces. You will drop each one a couple of times before finally getting them started. It simply takes too long to assemble. If I figure my time at say, $15 per hour, the finished house cost me about $300. Still, it is nice now to see the martins moving in."
4,AH-12D Martin House,"well,like everybody says,there is a lot of parts,it does have sharp edges,so be careful handling parts,it really is not that bad to put together,just sit down relax take your time.watch a program on tv or listen to the radio,it will take about 2/12 to 3 hours,taking your time,finished product looks great,putting one together again would be a piece of cake,i would buy another one no problem,hardest thing to put on was the roof,TAKE YOUR TIME!"
3,Major assembly required,"The finished product is great, but took over three hours to assemble (probably 100 or more parts, poor assembly instructions). When ordering, I saw no information indicating ""assembly required."""
2,Not What I Thought,"Product was time consuming to put together and did not fit snuggly together (lots of gaps in the flooring between rooms). The aluminum was extremely easy to bend, especially when trying to attach the railing, which does not stay in well. I will be searching for one better made. If it wasn't so... time consuming to put together, I would have taking apart and returned."
1,Worst bird house made,"Purchased this through Amazon.com. Package arrived quickly. After receiving the house I tried for 4 hours to put it together.The parts would not line up for a proper fit. I put it together twice. Once completed, the house looked terrible. I boxed the house up and returned it to Amazon. Check out the other reviews, they had similar problems. I wish I would have listened to them. Don't waste your time on it."
3,House of Starlings,"Hard kit to assemble. Use gloves! The kit was imcomplete, but the mfg. quickly sent me the missing part. The house only attracted a family of Starlings. Maybe next year?!"
1,huh!,"I am sorry I wasted my time with this. The acting was terrible. The plot was silly. Why they used a potato gun to kill the zombies I will never understand. The one good thing about this movie was, oh wait there was nothing good about this movie."
2,Poor film quality,Expecting to get a film with the quality of most of the Film Noir series I was disappointed.The color is faded. The photography is not sharp.I would expect that this old film be re-mastered like so many of the others.A disappointed viewer
1,Garbage,"It's complete garbage. I sent the first one back to the manufacturer for replacement after it stopped working a week after I purchased it. They sent me a second one, well that one worked for all of about five minutes!...total rip-off! not even worth it to send it back this time..."
2,A Tragic Attempt at a Mathematical Model,"The greatest difficulty of the Mathematical Mind is its inate inability to move beyond current linear scientific thinking in forecasting future outcomes. Any author who has to labor their verbiage to such an extreme extent as Professor Tipler is struggling with his own believability. The professor spends more time telling us what it is he is going to tell us than he does telling us, then contradicts what he it was he told us.For all its academic intensity, it boils down to a nonsensical and unsubstantiatable theorem. I grant this book a rating of ""2"" only because Dr Tipler is in all other aspects such an outstanding intellect and scholar."
1,A poor argument at best,"When an author comes out with a new theory, it is nice to actually support it with something that causes the reader to consider their idea. This book was filled with premises that ""support"" the author's conclusion that themselves were hard to swallow. Buy this book if you are in need of a good laugh... but if you are offended by pseudoscience as I am, steer clear."
3,crazy wisdom masters,Tipler has justified the existence of the eternal world (as if it needed justification). This scientific work he has brewed up is like a comforting blanket to all those who refuse to believe in the higher power that manifests itself on planes we can only glimpse at through other known conscious. Now all you geeky 'intellectuals' who know everything can justify a belief in something other than sci-fi futurisms. Try and live upward and drive hate and competition out of your lives and focus on the oneness of this beauty called life.
1,Insurmountable Blabberdash,"A collection of poorly edited lines of arguement that go off at a tangent to each other. The relationships between the different ideas are barely demonstrated and proven properly before the synthesized new idea is used as a launching-pad for another discussion on another 'breath-taking' idea. He does not address many of the fundamental issues of religion. He also does not elucidate his definition of 'God', which handicaps my understanding of his point of view, and therefore, the intention of the whole book."
3,Funny and unintentially illuminating book,"One hysterically funny book! I didn't know Tipler was such a wild and wacky humorist. It also clearly outlines the psychosocial common roots of Materialist science and the God of Abraham. Tipler lays out the Tribulations, the Rapture, the Kingdom of Heaven all in a neat, little theoretical bundle. The problem is that Tipler is in a search for absolutes. He's indefatigable in his literal quest for an endgame scenario in which he can believe.Still and all, Tipler is wonderfully bold in his theory. We need more bold theorists, so long as we all understand these are just concepts to play with, and not dogma. No reason to be afraid of it (the reviews of such a book are as telling as the book itself - so much fear and rage over a book).It's just the Extropian Book of the Dead. Doubt will still be a virgin in the morning."
1,One of the most disappointing books I have read,"While the mathematical speculation and logic in the beginning of this book is interesting, the idea that future humans would have any desire or reason to create machine emulations of all humans is unbelievable and unsupported by the book. I also have to agree with a previous reviewer: I fail to see how a programmed emulation of myself has anything to do with my immortality. How can a machine emulation be considered a resurrection of an individual? And why would anyone have a reason to create this emulation in the first place? Sadly, I am afraid this book argues for mortality rather than immortality."
2,Philosophy under the false guise of hard science.,"Tipler presents some intriguing ideas and tips his hat toscience (with a wide sweep across biology, physics, computerscience with a selective use of history and creative use ofmathematics.) However, by the end of chapter 1 he is firmly inthe realm of philosophy. In chapter 2 he crosses intoscience fiction. Complete with an intimidating ""Appendix forScientists"" (presumably to lend additional credibility), buta disapointing lack of thourough understanding of the seminalideas he so frequently quotes. Exciting as fiction, intriguingas philosophy, disapointing as science."
3,"Bait and switch, but still a good read","I first bought this book thoroughly excited at the prospect of a unification of science and religion, which is what I had read about the Omega Point Theory and the way it seemed in reviews. This is not what this book is. In the end, it is a scientific alternative to religion. It is a theory, and a highly speculative one, I find, about what may happen in the very distant future of the universe. And there are correlations, or perhaps only coincidences, of this possible future to the prophecies of many religions.I was disappointed in it, feeling that I had been tricked in what I bought. Being a lifelong Christian, I heartily disagree with Tiplers conclusion. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy the book. It has some great concepts and touches on a lot of interesting information about artificial intelligence and such like.Read it for the information, but if you're looking for something real to believe in, look elsewhere."
5,"It's Science, Folks!","It would be difficult to have a sufficiently deep and comprehensive background in general relativity, particle physics and information theory to be able to evaluate the merits of Dr. Tipler's arguments. One of the things that makes this book so impressive is his complete mastery of all these areas, when mastery of a single one would be a real achievement for any one person. Even if I am not in a position to cogently critique the theory presented, I will tell you that many people will find reading this book a tremendously powerful experience, especially if you would like to believe (as I would) that death is not permanent."
1,Von Daniken Redux,"Tippler has managed to create a work that surpasses, CHARIOTS OF THE GODS.This work shows why scientists should not write on religious subjects.It is laughable."
1,P.O.S.,"Tipler says many times ""as I have proved"". Huh? What the f is he talking about? There is no proof in this stinking pile of filth. He's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-I'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense, but I don't think it should matter. I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense. His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time. The more books you read, the sooner you know when to stop reading, put the book down, and read a work of fiction instead, which can play with such ideas without boring you to death."
2,not good science,"while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective. skip this one!!"
5,One book that put me in awe for a lifetime,"I am a science scholar and have read numerous literary works that explain to me the universe, but never once have I encountered as much knowledge as I did while reading The Physics of Immortality. The book told me more about what I didn't know than I ever knew existed. It gives a prediction of our future in every area of major study. The book overflows with knowledge and plans that I have never even heard of. It is a masterpeice of hard work and ideologies that we should all be aware of."
3,Tipler's prediction has failed,"I read this book some years ago, but if I recall correctly, the principle prediction Tipler's hypothesis makes is that the universe will recollapse to a point of infinite density at some point in the distant future. Again, going from memory, Tipler stated that if, in fact, the universe does not recollapse at any time in the future, then his hypothesis will have failed.Current cosmological understanding is that the universe will not only continue expanding indefinitely into the future, but also the rate of expansion is increasing. Therefore, unfortunately, as attractive as Tipler's hypothesis may be, it appears that it has been falsified."
5,Interesting read.,"I'll preface my review by saying that I rarely take this kind of edgy pre-theory read too seriously. I prefer to read such work purely to stir my mind, not change my thoughts on subjects that have no true bearing on my daily life.That said, this book presents an interesting far-reaching theory that attempts to unite universal religious beliefs with physics. I felt certain early assumptions were skimmed over too quickly without full proper proof, but again any book on the subject matter is ultimately using theory not law.The theory is interesting and the writing kept me engrossed even if I have not rushed out to declared I believe in it."
2,wings are not what you expect.,"So I ordered this costume just a few days ago to get prepared for this years trick or treat. Costume arrived very quickly and I had no problems with the company, at least not yet. Down side is the wings are clearly not the ones that are in the picture. You can look at the edge of the wings a see that the ones pictured are significantly larger. The wings pictured also curve more and come to points, giving it that bat wing look. The wings that come with the costume look like purple and black butterfly wings. The remainder of the costume is identical to what you see in the image. Disappointing considering the thing that makes this costume appear so adorable are the wings. The other problem is the head piece fits me, and this is supposed to be for a 0 to 6 months child. Glad I ordered this early as there is plenty of time to make my own set of bat wings, find a different costume or return this P.O.S."
1,complaint,"I order halloween costume for my newburn on 30 September.Right now, first November ,I still not reseive my purchase.I reagret ,that I purchase from this company.On my son's first halloween,he was without costume...."
2,Boring,"I should have read the title better....""Life and Death of An Oilman: The CAREER of E.W. Marland"". (capital letters mine). This was mainly 90% about the business life of Marland, whereas a true life story would have been VERY interesting. How he married his step daughter and lived in that wonderful mansion, but very little is said about any of that. Hence, I skipped through the book and read hardly any of it. Glad I bought it used."
2,Way too British,"I disagree with an earlier reviewer -- this is indeed a travel journal. The author describes his experience living temporarily in Cuba, and the tango lessons and the cult ceremony are all part of that. However, my primary objection is that he writes in either an extremely British style, or in a haughty style (it might be a mixture of both). I read a lot in many genres, but many times I found myself saying ""What is he talking about?!""Interesting subject; mediocre book."
3,"OK pen, not really ""black"" ink","It's a pen. It's fairly easy to write with, producing a smooth even line on non-glossy paper. (All the gel inks seem to do very poorly on glossy paper anyway.)Two gripes: The ink is not really very black. I'd call it more of a dark gray. The color of the paper can still be seen underneath, and the line is wide enough to notice that the edges of the line are very slightly darker than the middle.Second gripe: It dries out periodically. It's easy enough to take it apart and fix it - just poke the ""floater"" in the ink reservoir with a long pin or something, to push a drop of ink down into the rollerball. But for a cheap disposable pen, ""fixing"" is a chore that shouldn't be necessary.I usually buy the equivalent from Pilot (their G2). I picked up this ""Velocity"" in a pinch when the store didn't have the G2. Now that I've picked up some more G2s, the ""Velocity"" is stalled in a desk drawer..."
1,hate these,"They skip and it's hard to write continuously, hate these pens! Also, run out of ink much quicker than most pens."
5,GREAT BOOK,JUST WHAT I EXPECTED AND WANTED. THE BOOK ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION. HAVE ORDERED SIMILAR BOOKS. WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR BOOKS ON GUNS OF THE OLD WEST.
5,lever guns a must have,levers guns of the old west is a must have if you are going to shoot these old guns.loads are listed in each section with the models of marlins and winchester. enoughtsmokeless and black powder loads are listed to give you a good idea on powder-how andwhere to get brass to shoot these old timers. a must have for your reload library.
1,El Primer Instinto,"Una recopilacion de exitos pero tocados de forma acustica. El disco comienza con una version muy mediocre de ""Quisiera ser alcohol"" y ""No Dejes Que.."", los arreglos son muy limitados y la voz de Saul Hernandez nunca se ha oido peor.No todo el disco es malo, algunas canciones como ""La Llorona"", ""Imaginame"" y ""Antes de que nos olviden"" son salvables. ""La Celula Que Explota"" es destrozada al ser tocada en mariachi, ""Como Tu"" cae en el mas vulgar estilo tropical.Sin embargo, creo que lo peor de este album es haber incorporado una cancion de Juan Gabriel para tener exito (si, igual que Mana), ""Te lo pido por favor"" es probablemente la peor cancion que ha grabado el grupo.Canciones Recomendadas: solo ""La Llorona""."
4,"Jaguares, El Primer Instinto","La más nueva producción Caifán/Jaguar nos presenta una recopilación. No es una recopilación normal, en ésta existen nuevas versiones y todas acústicas de las canciones más propias para ésto.Como nuevo disco, hay nueva gira en la que es un nuevo concepto que proponen de medio concierto acústico y medio concierto eléctrico.Se preguntarán ""¿y qué pasa con la emoción del rock caifán/jaguar cuando lo vuelven acústico?"". Creo que es sólo una alternativa más y una muestra de lo buenos que son... de la buena música que traen.Vienen dos nuevas canciones: ""Te lo pido por favor"" una versión de una canción original de Juan Gabriel; y ""Arriésgate"" una nueva canción de protesta política, las dos serán sencillos.Esperemos que Saúl y su compañía nos sigan sorprendiendo con mucha más música y duren para rato, ya que son la mejor banda de este lado del mundo, ¡algo que nadie puede negar!"
4,CD only for true Caifanes/Jaguares Fans,"I must accept that there are a few song that are quite bad in the album. However, there are 4 or 5 song that save the album. Starting with a beautifull arrangement of strings in ""Matenme por que me muero"" and great ""prehispanic anthems"" in La vida no es igual"" and ""la llorona"". Most people were expecting to much I think, including my self, but I found out that this album is a great sentimental journey for those true Caifanes/ Jaguares Fans."
5,I LOVE THIS GROUP!,"This group has consistantly put out great music, and Primer Instinto is no exception. Whether they do hard rock or acoustic, these guys have the goods, and I like their rock music equally as well as their acoustic music. ¡Excelente!"
2,Why? - 2.5 Stars,"I got this album a few days in advance of it's public sale date and unfortunately, this album does not live up to the expectations. Saul Hernandez demonstrated throughout this album how his voice is shot and miles away from his glorious Caifanes days. The music was not bad, actually pretty good, especially on the track ""Como Tu"", which featured La Internacional Sonora Santanera. But Hernandez' voice was off pace and really a let down to the music.I honestly don't see a reason for creating this album as none of the tracks here are anywhere near the caliber of the original studio versions. I'm sorry to say that his voice, in fact, ruined some of the classic tracks. And also going back to revist the Caifanes music? I would have much rather preferred an acoustica or unplugged live album instead of this.By the way, many of the reviewers [most being in there mid-teens] here will probably be praising this album, giving it 5 stars, and saying how it's the greatest since Sgt. Peppers, hehe."
4,great book,sometimes people forget about things and hard to appreciate for what we have.this book should be one that will remind us to appreciate and remember things that we've forgtten.
1,Slow; not challenging; dull,"I purchased this software second hand; I had high hopes based on the reviews, but did not have a five star experience. With all of Mattel's dollars, they could not produce a computer game that was interesting, didn't work at a snail's pace, and had some kind of real challenge for a six year old. This software isn't even a deal if it were free. You ride a course & occassionally jump over something. That gets old real fast. Teresa asks for the same race over and over again & the race is where you run straight & jump over two things. Supposedly you can pick ""missions"" for Barbie, but they didn't work. You can groom the horse which consists of washing her with a brush & then brushing. These challenges would be better fit for a younger child, but since the software freezes & glitches up consistenly, there's no age that this software is good for. Save your money for a better video game system!! So disappointing."
1,Pathetic,This is the most pathetic video I have ever purchased. I will probably never buy a french video after this experience.
1,Much too flimsy!,"I got these as a gift my sister-in-law to match my Empire Red mixer... like other people have noticed, they are a shade or so darker (though not the really dark cinnamon). The rubber base is great if you're whisking something up, but my whisk (a metal kitchenaid one, btw) scratched the bottom and sides. Mine also faded in the dishwasher and the smallest one cracked at the lip when i tried to pour the contents of that bowl into a larger one.I won't buy these or any other plastic bowls again; stainless or earthenware is the way to go!"
2,Cracked after a year of use,"I was thrilled when I found these and thought they'd be good quality, being Kitchenaid products. For a year they were great. Sadly, the other day when I was cleaning one I found a large crack in it's side. These did go into my dishwasher, but were also hand washed, and stored carefully."
4,Nice bowls if you don't put in the dishwasher.,"These are nice, basic mixing bowls. They are of nice size and pretty well made. If you wash in the dishwasher the bottom seems to fall off a lot - so we just hand wash them. A small inconvenience for a nice product."
5,Fantastic Bowls,"I bought my original red Kitchen Aid bowl set at a Kohl's Department Store, paying $25+ for them.I love these bowls. The complaints about dishwashers and hand mixers should be discounted as these bowls are not meant to go in the dishwasher except on a top shelf and a hand mixer will break off chips of any plastic bowls. Hand mixers should be used in glass, ceramic or stainless steel bowls. When mixing we use our big Kitchen Aid stationery mixer and the accompanying stainless steel bowl. Any plastic bowl is not going to hold up if not properly used. When using these bowls for food preparation I always immediately wash them by hand as I am cleaning up.I have had my bowls over a year of heavy use. One only cracked at the top due to my fault of pressing it to put away in the cabinet. If I would have not been in a hurry, this would have not happened.Today I am ordering another set of these fantastic bowls."
3,Very lightweight,"The shapes and sizes are fine and the rubber on the bottom is nice. I have only handwashed these and they are easy to handle because they are so lightweight. On the other hand the lightness makes them feel cheap and flimsy, If I had paid regular price for these I would be very upset but I bought them on sale and it was easier to keep them. The color is a dark muddy red, not that attractive, it looks nicer on my computer monitor. What bothers me the most is the sharpness of the top edge, especially the spout. The edge is actually sharper than my stainless dinner knives, you couldn't cut yourself it just feels bad when washing or drying the bowls. Since I paid less than half price using the sale price and buy 4 get 1 free I can't complain. The regular price is outrageous!"
4,"Great plastic mixing bowls, a bit pricey...","I like these bowls, but have a couple of 'negatives'...the positives are that they have rubber grips on the bottom to help them stay put, and the capacities are clearly marked on the bottoms. In addition, they have pouring spouts. Now the negatives: I think that for the Clearance Price, they're a bit thin. It would have been helpful for Amazon to put the construction (i.e., plastic) in the product description, and when I went to the Kitchenaid site, they didn't have it there either! The other negative is that I expected them to match my Kitchenaid Empire Red stand mixer, but they are a shade darker. All in all, I'm pleased, but not overwhelmingly so."
2,Cheapy bowls,"I received these in May 2009 as a wedding gift and have used exclusively since. As a mixing bowl set, the sizes are nice and they nest well. What sucks about them is that they warp in the dishwasher, despite being described as dishwasher safe. All of them have also cracked in the bottom around the same time and now I need to replace them. The handles are uncomfortable also - if you are holding a bowl full of cupcake batter in one hand and trying to fill the pan using the other hand at the same time. I did get a few years out of them, but for a 'professional' set I expected them to hold up longer after light use."
2,Good before they fell apart...,I actually bought these at Target a while ago in the white color. They have all slowly cracked along the bottom so anything liquid just seeps out of them. Waste of money. If I spend $33 on a set of bowls I expect them to last more then a year or two...
1,scratch & scuffed,"I received the bowls rarely quickly. They were packed great. But the bowls were scratched & scuffed all over, at least the larger one on the outside. I didn't open the package to check the 2 inside bowls. Because of the condition of the largest bowl. I called for a return or to send it back & get a set of bowls that wasn't damaged. Because of a severely broken leg & ankle, I can't walk or drive. The customer service rep. told me no problem he would have Fed-ex to pick them up. Well Fed-ex still hasn't picked them up & I still have the damaged bowls. I feel they should issue a pickup but now I would like my money back because of poor customer service. Karen Lamb"
3,decent SNES fighter,"I've always thought FF was underrated. this is another variation of FF2, with the 4 boss characters and additional characters (duck king, tung fue rue, and geese). this is basically the same as part 2. The controls are a little tight, but hey, the best fighters are the more difficult ones right! I still prefer fatal fury (or any of the SNK fighters) over Street Fighter, and definitely the lame mortal kombat games! a great find."
5,The Healthy Exchange Diabetic Desserts Cookbook,I love it. Great receipies. My cousin and I can share tips and ideas by phone. She has the book and has made lots of the receipes.
5,"Impeccable performances, soothing music","The very first time I heard a recording from this CD was on NPR several years ago, and it featured excerpts from the Cyrillus Kreek piece. Needless to say, I was in awe of what I heard and consequently had to get the CD. It was one of the most worthwhile purchases I ever made!The choir performs with ubiquitous energy and notable vigor when a selection would require it. Furthermore, there are many contrasting works featured on this disc, from the ethereal Cyrillus Kreek selection, to the folk-inspired Spring Song and other, more avant-garde repertoire.It may be the case that one will not instantly fall in love with every single track on this disc, but I would make a case for the fact that there are a number of universally appealing choral works on this disc that, next to the somewhat affordable price, would certainly warrant the purchase!"
5,The ONLY thing to wear in season,"Hopefully, the NFL will resume this fall, but this is the only jersey for me. High quality material and looks great."
5,Christmas Special = Good! Episode 25= Good!,The christmas special is good as a side story that doesn't really take place but follows the theme of the story exectly. As for the 25 episode it is the continuation of the story. But for some reason the creators of the anime did not make all of the episonds according to the Magna that they took it from so if you want to know the whole story i suggest that you read the Magna after Vol. 12.
1,Didnt like this movie,Ok i like love hina just not the xmas movie. Its just to slow moving for me. You want to see a good anime movie then get Sakura Wars the movie great dubbing chracters and story line. But this is my least fav dvd that i own. Im more into Sakura Wars. You want rare boxsets then go to www.animekrazy.com www.animecollector.com. Thats where im getting the love hina complete collection on dvd. Love hina is a good series but movies are kinda of slow for me.
1,Beware the Penguin,"Great story originally, but the Penguin version is condensed and simplified for kids, and reduced to 83 pages."
5,Delightful.,"I think I'll read a Wodehouse every year. The stories are largely the same, the characters quite transparent. But the style is just wonderful. My favourite run of novels are Blandings related - pig husbandy and theft, various misjudgements of the heart, mad Aunts. Its all here in spades."
4,Maybe this will help,"from the back cover of the 1975 Signet editionThe Terran Empire was crumbling -And it required the remarkable talents of Sir Dominic Flandry, bon vivant and universal troubleshooter, to put the pieces back together. A hint of trouble and the purchase of an aristocratic slave girl sent Flandry on a quick flight to Diomedes aboard his well-equipped spacer, Hooligan. As he suspected, there was a deadly plan for galaxy-wide insurrection and civil war that could blast the tottering Empire into its component planets. Time was running out, and only Dominic Flandry, half a universe away, had the knowledge to prevent an explosion which could spark the beginning of the end for Terran civilization..."
4,A fair beginner's book to socket programming,"This is very readable and usable as a beginner's guide to socket programming. One particular aspect I liked is that the author took the pain to illustrate the socket structure well which many book glossed over. Also, the sample codes are short and illustrate the use of the socket calls well. The book could have been expanded to cover HTTP,SOAP,XML, etc to give it a 5 star. Also think that the publisher could have used better quality print material."
3,Does NOT cover IPv6,"In spite of the description in the Editorial Reviews on this site, this book does not even mention the term IPv6 anywhere. Not even the slightest mention. This is distressing to me, since I specifically wanted reference examples for an IPv6 project I'm working on.If you need IPv4 info, this seems to be a good book."
4,Eddie Murphy at his best,"This is a classic. Funny, good 80s action/comedy genre, and still watchable even after all of these years. If you only know Eddie Murphy from his recent stretch of family films, you should watch this and your mind will be blown.It's too bad he doesn't do stuff like this anymore."
2,Not Good At All,"This movie is not good to me at all. This movie has a thin story line, Axel Foley makes drug busts for cocaine. The movie seems like they took a Miami Vice episode and made it a movie. This movie released in late 1984 grossed an astonishing 234 million dollars. The only highlight to this movie was it's soundtrack... Get the sequel at least that was better."
4,Great Movie But Disapointing Taste!,I liked this movie but it didn't stand out to me to be one of the best movies I have seen. The one thing that did bother me is that this movie is rated PG-13 and there is a nude dancer scene...not to mention nowhere on the dvd there is brief nudity.
1,Cannot believe how lame this is,"Missed this huge 80s hit until now. It's .... terrible. Except for Eddie Murphy's laugh, why was this movie a phenomenon? I don't get it. Features the usual Keystone Kops take, but this time, it's the BH police force made to look like they wouldn't know crime if it hit them over the head. Completely unrealistic right to the end when the police chief doesn't believe the ultra violent shootout that just happened was called for. I laughed twice: when one of the villains gets thrown into a salad bar, and when Eddie Murphy stuffs three bananas into a squad car's tail pipe. The rest? Sterile at best."
1,beverly hills cop (BLU-RAY),The transfer to blu-ray is (SUPER GRAINY)very unhappy with it.The is movie which most of us already know is a 5 star movie.eddies best.I just wanted to let buyers know this before they buy it.thanks
4,If only Eddie's movies stayed this way,He would have still had his core audience. Now he does nothing but family-orientated movies. BHC is a classic and probably his best and funniest movie ever. You can never get tired of it!
2,It could have been better,This is one of the many movies that could have been. It has a few lasting jokes and a loveable cast but otherwise I don't see why people LOVE this movie.It spent its WHOLE time developing the story and the cast.(but I have to say part 2 redeamed itself)
4,East force meets the West force,"This movie is a slick 80's film about a cop from a rough town vacationing in sunny Beverly Hills, but he's really there to find the truth about his friends death that he witnessed. Eddie Murphy had good stance and puts a good pace in the film and doesn't let your eyes droop from any of his actions to find out some clues to the death of his friend. This movie is a must have for any fan of the comedic/crime blend."
3,a so-so transfer of a well-known movie,"When this film was made it was interesting and amusing. The set-up has aged somewhat with three movies in this franchise, plus its imitators. I wasn't as entertained watching it now, and Eddie Murphy's foul mouth isn't the surprise it was then this film was new. Still, this is the best of the series, and it has been given a reasonable transfer to Bluray. I have seen much better transfers, even for significantly older films, but this one is good enough."
5,movie,"Man this movie is a classic, it is funny and entertaining the whole way through. I really miss those 80's movies where they played all the popular music and had silly situations all the way through. This movie can be watched over and over and over. Trust me, you'll be quoting Axel for days, and don't get me started on his silly laugh! Don't forget to slow motion the scene where Axel fights someone and they put a stunt double in, its totally obvious that it was LESTER from 227!!! hahaahahaha! have fun."

2,Cat uninspired,The cat just ignored it. Not enough catnip I guess so that he could smell it. Disappointed in the product.
4,Exactly what it says it is,"I couldn't find one less expensive. Very convenient for the 5 times a year that I need a metric socket. I am sure it's not the highest quality, but it works for me."
1,low quality,"I am disappointed from the low quality of the product. Tried to use the 10 socket and it expanded while tightening the bolt of my front disk brake. I did use another snap-on wrench and did the job, but the sockets are made of poor quality steel. Money lost."
5,Wonderful,The table was exactly what I thought it would it be. It was even more beautiful than in the picture. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who loves dragons and he was completely taken away by it. I would absolutely recommend it to others who like dragons.
1,seller is horrible!!,"I ordered the product thru Amazon.com. After several weeks went by without hearing anything about shipment, I contacted seller by email. No response. I called, no response, I contacted Amazon, they contected seller and was told it will be shipped. I still got no info on shipment and afte 3 days i contacted Amazon again. They called seller and got no response. Amazon stood by thier A-Z warranty and refunded my money. My child never got the table. I would have given them a worse rating but that's as low as it goes."
4,good book,I received this item promptly and in good condition. Dana Stabenow is a good mystery writer.
2,Too Much Preaching; Too Little Mystery,"In this book, Kate Shugak finds a body while picking mushrooms. It turns out to be the body of a person who has been missing for quite awhile, but whose father never reported him missing.Kate is always arrogant with her beliefs, but this book really goes too far. I fully agree with Dana Stabenow's views on religious fundamental extremists. However, she goes too far when she starts trashing all religion and people who believe in them.I really liked Kate's remembrances of her first year of college and of the professor who turned her on to literature. But none of this makes up for all her preaching against religion, people from other states, people who listen to different music, etc.The mystery itself is unsatisfying, too. I agree with the other reviewer who lamented the lack of suspects, red herrings, etc."
2,A Fanatical Look at Fanatics,"I have enjoyed several of the Kate Shugak mysteries. This isn't one of them. This seemed less of a mystery novel and more of an attempt to promote her ideas on religion in general and strict biblical faiths in particular. It isn't that I don't support Dana Stabenow's opinions on fanatical religions. However, her views are as distorted as are those of whom she describes. As a previous reviewer stated, you might consider skipping this particular novel in the series."
1,Try another of her books,"Dana Stabenow writes good mysteries so this book was a surprising disappointment. There is no mystery, barely even an attempt to write one. There is only one suspect, a group of people the author doesn't like, and that's who did it. No red herrings, no other suspects. What kind of a mystery is that? If you do read it, be prepared to be beaten over the head with the author's prejudices on nearly every page. Skip this book and read some of her actual mysteries. I've read four others so far and liked them all."
1,One of the worst books I've read in a long tme,"Dana Stabenow takes her religious predjudices and slaps the reader in the face with them in ""Play With Fire"". I have read, and enjoyed, her other books. This book has very little plot and is poorly written. Maybe instead of bashing religion, Dana should have focused on writing a readable story. This book has already been deleted off of my IPad."
2,Not Her Best,"I was disappointed in this book, she trashed religion in general and made comments that people who believe in religion are basically lazy people who do not think on their own, I would say writing a book and taking this viewpoint shows laziness and lack of creativity in her writing.It's so easy to take the religious extremes and equate that to all religions and pass that off as the truth when it's far from it. Her characters point out how many people have been murdered in the name of religion, a fact for sure, but she doesn't mention how many more millions are killed in the name of non-religion, communists like Mao and Stalin, not to mention Hitler. It's not even a close comparison at all, but again I guess Stabenow is too lazy to look at the facts.All in all I like her writing although of course it's all fantasy what Kate gets herself out of but then this book was boring throughout, from start to finish with a dud of an ending."
2,Not the best of this series,I have liked all in this series up to this one. The subject matter (fanatic religionists) wasn't my cup of tea. And then the fact that in the end nothing was done about it was strange. I say skip this one and go on to the next. I haven't yet but it will most likely be better than Play With Fire.
2,"preachy, preachy, preachy","Kate Shugak is getting more and more arrogant and more dislikable. The mystery seems insignificant in comparison to Stabenow's seeming need to preach. The book is about 100 pages longer than her previous books and most of it can be attributed the preaching arrogance of the main character, Kate Shugak. Her arrogance and high-mindness are a real turnoff. For example, she disses all people in organized religion as not being able to think for themselves, declares all states that end in a vowel to be redneck states, disses all music that she doesn't like, and if someone isn't enjoying the outdoors in the manner that she doesn't see fit they really don't deserve to be outside. It is all just a little too much for me! This will be my last Kate Shugak mystery. (As an aside, the love angles are just a little 8th-grade for me."
2,"Too Much Talk, Not Enough Action","Yes, Kate Shugak is normally a cerebral person. She has to be, as much as she chooses to go it alone. And, usually, that makes the character more interesting. In this book, however, it's just BORING! Reading an actual treatise on picking mushrooms might have been more interesting. The reader is certainly clear as to Kate's (the author's?) views on religion and education. Unfortunately, the mystery doesn't just take a backseat -- it was left by the side of the road somewhere. My advice, FWIW, is to read any other book in this or the Liam Campbell series."
3,Play With Fire,"Stabenow has an interesting setting to write about, the main reason to read the books. I was annoyed with Kate when she profited from the bear gall bladders in an earlier book, and almost did not go back to read more. This book, with its lack of resolution, and the weight of death loaded onto a child's shoulders, the failure to make an attempt to bring justice (though it may seem pointless), the failure to close the door when two men she is close to are aware of what she is doing (Jack and the Trooper) and will expect closure all lead one to feel that she could not find an ending that was satisfactory.I will keep trying though. I started this series at the beginning, and I am on book 5. Will see if it improves."
2,Styli-Style Flat Pencil-Lip Liner,"I was a little disappointed with this lip pencil. It was nice, the way it is designed; flat; but, it was very dry and too dark."
1,Not real happy,"After all the time I spent searching for the product could. Not find the shade I wanted, so I thought i'd try a different shade. waste of my hard earned money! ,,does not go on well at all color is bad nothing like chart shown and I was waiting for a matte ,lip pencil it wasn't at all. Very dissappointed!"
3,Lip Pencil,"It's dryer and pinker than I expected--otherwise, it was as advertised. The price was reasonable and the shipping very fast."
3,paris,This show is all about entertainment. So don't take is seriously. You know some part of it is fake : Lines/plots thrown in here and there. Anyway the show is about 2 rich girls thrown into the world of rural folk. See the lifestyles clash and enjoy the ride.
4,Guilty Pleasure TV! It's always FOX isn't it?,"I watched ""The Simple Life"" periodically on FOX during the few months it came on. It's funny in your-so-stupid kind of way. I can't believe Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie act like this. They're real life sitcom stars!The boy crazy rich and bratty 20-something girls move from posh and pampered Los Angeles to a small town farm in Arkansas with a family for a month. Thence they pluck chickens, milk cows and cause havoc on the quiet and unsuspecting town. Both girls struggle to fit in accordingly with the family. They get ordinary jobs but fail miserably at them. They have no moral integrity! But that's the beauty in this show!Paris and Nicole sometimes don't realize how brainless they are. But at the same time they mock fun of themselves and know how silly they are to people. I take that back, theyre not brainless! It's just reality television! I won't get the DVD though, just watch the show on FOX."
5,Blonde Entertainment At It's Best,"Anyone who doesn't find this show at the very least amusing needs a sense of humor asap! Taking two rich, spoiled blondes out of their natural, Los Angeles habitat and putting them on a farm with no cell phones, no credit cards and watching them as they struggle to hold down a normal, everyday job is hilarious. As soon as Paris and Nicole come on screen, their charm quickly ignites the small town and us viewers. You can't wait to see what adventures unfold for these beautiful, bubbly ladies. From farming to fast food jobs to curfews and country living, Paris and Nicole's worlds are turned upside down as is the family's that lets them in. While Paris and Nicole try hard to live the simple life, they always find a way to put their spin on things and it will keep you in stitches. I would recommend The Simple Life to anyone that likes to laugh and have a good time and to anyone open minded enough to see the way life changes people and how people change life for others."
1,Why would anyone put any effort in producing this?,"Ok, take two spoiled rich white girls(who dont show a single speck of intelligence or decency) put them in a scenerio where they try to do what blue collar workers do everyday to survive, yet they do it to amuse themselves and the idiots that watch their show religiously, they do it so they can remind everyone that they are just there to make a joke out of the things that people put their muscle and sweat into just to make ends meet, that is the sick humor that spoiled worthless little runts like Paris Hilton exploit just to add to their multimillion dollar bank accounts and get their faces on every magazine in every convenient store in middle America.........I saw one episode of this, I became an existentialist on the spot....the power of the media prevails"
4,Out of control,"I honestly think that Paris and Nicole are a guilty little pleasure. Every week my friends and I would watch the show and crack up, thinking how could they do that?! It's a fantasic show and completely addicting. Paris and Nicole are sweet girls, who seem to be misunderstood and truly sweet inside."
4,Great show....very educational....,"I believe this is a perfect example of how anyone of their age and social class would act, they are really normal girls, with an extraordinarily rich up bringing. I think they are really great................."
5,They are hot rich and wicked!,I dont know why people bag them out they are really cool and i watch their show every thursaday night at 8pm. they arent sluts they just like to have fun! they feel comfortable wearing clothes like they do so people should stop baging them out! maybe people are gelouse of what they wear because they look so good in it. So what if they really do act like they do on the show people should stop judging them they could be really nice people! keep up the great work paris and nicole.
4,not the best--but pretty good!,"i love the simple life. ever since i saw season two/road trip, and learned how silly and fun (and extravagant? ridiculous? but in a good way!) paris and nicole are, i have really come to enjoy the show. season one, where they live on a farm with a family for a month, is funny and endearing in it's own right, but really two is the cornerstone. definitely though, if you like the show at all, all of the seasons are worth watching."
1,Should be called the stupid life,"Paris Hilton is not a bad person, she simply has nothing of value to add.This video set shows that.If you like Paris Hilton, you really must have a shallow and empty life. Not a simple one."
1,A disgusting piece of crap.,"This is a disgusting piece of crap. I would give it no stars if I could. I was disgusted and appalled at these people's behavior. They are the two LEAST deserving people in the world. They are vapid, stupid, witless, crass, vulgar creatures, and deserved to be slapped. Don't waste your money and time. I may not be wealthy, but at least I have manners, compassion, and class. And that's worth more than a million dollars."
5,this dvd is hot thats hot,paris hilton and nicole richie are the best i heart them laugh laugh laugh this dvd was good because it made nicole richie famous and paris hilton even more famouse do you love it loves it thats hot
3,Not as good as the following seasons...,The Simple Life Season 1 acts as a foundation point for what turned out to be a humourous and entertaing television experience as it follows around spoilt rich girls Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie as they experience the 'Simple Life'.At this price buy Season 1 just make sure you get Season 2 as it is the funniest of all the seasons and has much more humour and interesting things happen throughout it's duration.
1,When stupid shows happen,"Why anyone would purchase a DVD like this is beyond me. There is no purpose to this show except for the obvious fact that Paris and Nichole want to be in the spotlight. This show may give some of the yonger viewers the impression that if these two can get away with the way they behave, that its okay to behave this way.This is the stupidest show I have every watched and I hope it only lasts for one season."
4,interesting show,"I am from just about 30 minutes down the road from where they shot this show and I enjoyed it. I've only seen a few episodes, but I thought it was great, because they just had fun. They got to do things that I've always wanted to do, like milking a cow, and doing all sorts of weird jobs without worrying if they would get fired or not. I didn't think it was demeaning at all for Arkansans."
5,worth the laughs,This may seem like a really stupid show but my whole family got tons and tons of laughs out of it. It's only tv so don't let them being snobs and dumb blondes stop you from buying this entertainment. You really can't go wrong if you just think of it as two dumb girls put out of their place. But if you are against blondes and reality tv shows then don't buy this.
1,The bombast of the unpure and frivolous nouveaux-riche,"If watching unintelligent degenerates insult and make a mockery of middle america, namely the bible belt, than this jaunt into drivel filled waste is just your cup of tea. I'd personally rather watch paint dry than to let my morals soak in this tepid cesspool of filth."
5,SOCIALITES RULE,"Bad reviews are from bitter, jealous people to be honest. Paris is a sweet, rich, girl who hasen't had to work a day in her life - seeing her try is funny, Nicole is a dirrty minded laugh, both of them on te screen are dynamite. Paris dosen't disappoint, shes stunning! Totally get this DVD, socialites rule!"
1,"When you really examine it, it's pathetic and boring","What exactly is to laugh at here? Watching these girls live up to their reputation as idiots as they wreak havoc in a small town and create nothing but distress for those poor people in Altus? It's not funny, but sad. Sad for these very immature girls who have no respect for others and barely any education even though they could have afforded the best. And sad for the people whose lives and businesses they created so much grief for.It may be ""just a show"", but is it entertainment? Not really. There truly isn't much that goes on, except for these braindead brats pretending to work for about a whole minute, and then rudely ignoring the rules of the man who was gracious enough to let them into his home. They've got ALOT of growing up to do. ALOT!He should have kicked them out ..."
3,"Great, funny show. Horrible DVD.","I absolutely loved this show. It was so funny. But be aware that this DVD sucks. First of all, when you put the DVD and the main titles comes up there is no music at all. But you can tell from what's going on on the screen that there should be some sort of sound. Also, this only contains the ""official"" 7 episodes. The reunion special and the never before seen episode is not on it. The ""special features"" is pretty much just scenes from the episode that aired when the season was over. Usually FOX DVDs are great, but this one left me wanting more. A lot more! Other than those problems, the 7 shows you do get are hilarious."
4,Just entertainment,"So they're lazy, irresponsible, not very smart, and prove in this show they can't do any real work accept persuade people with their looks. Who cares, They're not my kids. The show is just funny to watch how 2 girls who have never done anything in their life try to adapt to a different life. I enjoyed it as entertainment only and not about rich girls being rich. If you don't want you kids to watch this than don't watch it around them. I think most kids can comprehend that this is not real life for an average person and will understand that if they do the same things then there will be consequences. If not then your kids are just as dumb as these girls. The show is funny to me and worth watching. Don't expect to learn much though, it's just TV."
4,TAKE IT or leave it,"TWO CHOICES, you like the show, or you dont. The girls are hilarious, and the best part of the show is the girls subtle mission to change how celebrities are seen as. They are people too, and can be pretty good ones too. They respect you if you respect them. The message is clear...they dont look down on you...if you dont look up on them...well its clear to me anyway...the show starts out funny and stays that way, but just a little seriousness and emotion creeps in at the end. The 'purse'episode/incident really upset me, the redneck bums sat on their barstools...anyway, theres also another message, no one family is going to change these girls...and thats good, they are great the way they are. The second season is also good.also recommend:BUFFY The Vampire Slayer:MASH"
1,I can sum up this show in one word,"STAGEDYes, it is sometimes funny, cute, or whatever other adjective you want to substitute but a reality show it is not."
5,"""The Craziest stuff I ever seen ""","this dvd earns 1,000,000 stars for me because i love to see 2 blodes stuck on a farm for 30 days with out their luxury lifes tyle !lol"
5,Excellent Job to Fox and Paris and Nicole,"This is truly the most excellent show on television. With all of the riff-raff going on about Paris and Nicole, an average person would expect them to be skanks, but no way! These are truly kind and generous people, always saying please and thank you, telling people and reassuring them that they are hot. I love them, and they are hot. I can't wait to buy this DVD. Heck, I might buy 10 of them!!!"
3,Bought for daughter,"It came quickly and it worked is about all I can say since I do not care for the show, but my daughter wanted it since she knew one of the boys in the hosting family in Altus. She was happy so she must of seen what she wanted to see and now, as far as I know, it has never been played again."
5,So funny,"But also a bit outrageous. I mean these girls are so disrespectful and crazy at times, but that's the show and that's why it's so funny and entertaining to watch..."
4,"Charming, old-fashioned fun","After encountering an early-morning broadcast of this film years ago, I had to track down a copy to own. Those who prefer Rogers in musicals may not enjoy this, but those who like to see her stretch and take on unusual, challenging roles should enjoy her winsome performance here as--of all things!--a pickpocket in training. Her Fagin/Svengali is the consummately nasty Basil Rathbone, but in this sweetly old-fashioned story true love conquers all obstacles. This isn't a classic of the calibre of Kitty Foyle or Bachelor Mother, but it's got a quiet, wistful charm of its own."
2,poor quality recording,This is a very poor quality recording. I wish I had spent the couple extra dollars and bought the better version.
2,Did I get the only bad copy ever made?,This may be a good movie; I couldn't tell because the picture and sound qualities were so bad. This may be a good movie; I couldn't tell because the picture and sound qualities were so bad.
4,Gilby + Tracii = blistering live album,"'99 Live is the best live recording that I have bought in a long time. Gilby and Tracii's double barrelled guitar attack pumps the raw energy of the show straight out of your speakers, it's great stuff. Eric Singer's precision drumming really stands out, this is a tight band on fire. It's also very interesting to listen to Tracii's versions of the solo's originally recorded by Slash (monkey chow, Tijuana jail, cure me...or kill me...). My only gripe is that 8 tracks is a bit short, 10 or 12 tracks would be more satisfactory. It's not as though Gilby doesn't have enough good material in his back catalogue."
4,Sky Cappelletti delivers a wonderful album,"Sky Cappelletti's ""Intersection"" is a nice blend of insightful ballads (""Just outside the wall"") and edgier songs(""Wrong with me""). But the highlight of the CD is,without a doubt,the first three songs; catchy pop tunes that will have you humming for a long while!"
5,The best DVD yet!,This is the best set of episodes put together since Volume 17. If your a fan of InuYasha then you should get this DVD.
5,Way to Wisdom: DVD 19,This DVD cannot have episode 54 on it because that episode is on DVD 18. This DVD probably has episodes 55-57 on it. We'll see when they finally get a picture up for it.
5,Convenient!,"I love this containers. First of all, I am a big fan of the Isis Breast Pump, so these containers are perfect for me. I express into these containers--freeze them--thaw them out--replace the sealing disc with the nipple--warm it up. Then my husband is ready to feed the baby. It's one of their times together, and I get to spend time with my older children. Perfect."
2,polycarbonate plastic a concern,...These would be great except they are made with polycarbonate plastic which can leach a potentially harmful chemical called bisphenol-A. The problem worsens the older and more worn the plastic becomes. I would be concerned if I were to sterilize these containers frequently or if I sterilized formula while in the container (but most people don't do that anymore...
1,Too long to prepare,"If you are going to use these bottles as storage for frozen milk, beware. They take a VERY long to defrost and with a screaming infant as your side, you don't want to wait any longer than you have to to feed your child. Also, they took up most of my freezer space. If I wanted enough milk storage back up, I would have had to purchase a separate freezer. I switched to Gerber storage bags and even though they are floppy, they are much easy to store large quanities of milk and only take a few minutes to defrost and warm."
2,They leak!,"I would recommend getting breastmilk storage bags instead. If you don't carefully tighten the lids and get them on exactly right, they leak everywhere, including on your baby when you are feeding them."
1,THEY LEAK!,"If you plan to pump and then store immediately upright in your fridge, these will work great for you. If, however, you plan to travel with these containers, be prepared for them to leak your precious breastmilk. The caps are not airtight! By the way, if you purchase the toddler non-spill spouts to go with the set...they also leak. I've experimented with varying the tightness and wetting the cap, but all to no avail."
4,Excellent Guide Not Enough Cases,"This is an excellent book for undergraduates who are looking to prepare themselves for an interview in consulting or finance. I took account a couple years ago and didn't remember everything about it. But this book gives a good review of all the necessary topics that would be needed during an interview. It covers business strategy technics, marketing strategies, and finance related topics. While the review covers half of the book, another tenth is focused on some real interviews from MBA students or other companies. Another quarter is actual case interviews. The author does go through on how to answer these cases. However, the maximum length give to each case was 2 pages. To me, that was not nearly enough for a case. And also, there are only about 15 real cases, there are about 15 practice ones. The last 15 percent is dedicated to guesstimates and brainteasers.So overall, it's a good book; however, I wish there were more cases."
1,Beware of this!,"This is an older show. Made in 1990. I wanted to see the old Coney my dad told me about. I only experienced the 60's at Coney Island! This is a very sad over blown doc. Sorry, but there is NO joy in this piece. Coney was a place of joy for millions of people! This doc shows non of that. The heavy hands who made it tried too hard. There are some good film pieces that show much of the parks that existed, but there is so little joy and happiness, and there are long voice over quotes from famous writers and such that linger on sad pictures with even sadder music!BEWARE>>>>> there is SEVERE animal cruelty shown in this!!!! This is a scene where they show the electrocution of an elephant! It is totally unnecessary and cruel to show. So disappointing they felt this was needed. There should be a warning on this! Do not let a child watch. It is so disturbing.What a sad piece of film making."
5,An entertaining picturebook biography of the life and adventures of Katherine Stinson Otero,"Katherine Stinson Otero High Flyer by Neila Skinner Petrick (with exceptional pastel artwork illustrations by Daggi Wallace) is an entertaining picturebook biography of the life and adventures of Katherine Stinson Otero who was the fourth American woman to be certified as an airplane pilot in the earliest days of aviation. Guiding young readers through the inspiring accomplishments of this remarkable young woman, Katherine Stinson Otero High Flyer is very highly recommended reading for all young readers, as well as an excellent picturebook resource for librarians, teachers, and parents wishing to provide young girls with inspiring role models."
5,Nicely written and very interesting.,"I wanted to read this book because I so enjoyed the author's participation in Ken Burns's baseball documentary. It was interesting to learn that she actually wrote the book AFTER that project, because so many people started asking her about her baseball memories. The book tells the story of her own life - family experiences, Catholic upbringing, etc. - interwoven with her love of baseball and esp. the Brooklyn Dodgers."
4,A delightful and vivid memoir of a Brooklyn childhood,"I must strongly disagree with another customer reviewer who pronounced this book ""boring."" I thought this memoir was beautifully written and that it vividly evoked the world of the author's Brooklyn neighborhood in the 1950s. It's so rare now to read about a happy childhood. Doris Kearns Goodwin balances the happiness and innocence of the child's view with the wider knowledge of her adult self. It's a lovely book, and one that you might enjoy even if you don't care about baseball or Brooklyn."
5,Doris Kearns Goodwin makes History more fascinating.........,"Never has one author caputured the art of writing especially about Baseball, the Kennedy's, the Roosevelts. I love to read her reading, she is most intelligent and makes me want to absorb more and more history. She brings back great feelings of a girl/her father/the love of BaseBall. Thank you Doris !!!"
1,Is this orginal work?,"My first response after reviewing this book was where did I read this before. In the past two years, I have been reluctant to acquire anything written by this author as she has a reputation for rewriting what others have done before. Fear and trepidation consume me that I will be revisitng other authors' work. The amazing thing is that the author is so brazen that she even tries to repesent she is responsible for anything she writes. When I taught I always impressed upon my composition students that they project their own feelings and ideas. I question whether the author has an idea of her own. Rather than refer to her work any longer and use her books as a model, i embarassed she has exploited the works of others. This book may be presented as a rewite of history but I am more afraid that it is a rewrite of other authors' works. This is dishonest and makes me want to return all her books for a refund from her."
1,"Doris, is this really you or a copy","I use to read Ms. kearns books and was mesmerized by some of the information. Unfortunately, now my only excuse to even peruse a book is to determine whose work she was stealing this time. It is a disgrace to think she is capable of pontificating and expoinding on subjects when her ideas are those of other more original and creative thinkers. I wonder what she is capable of producing on her own."
3,Boring - if I was 10 years older it could be my life,I was very disappointed. This is just a nice little life in suburban New York rooting for thie Brooklyn Dodgers in the 50's. It's perhaps too similar to my life - in suburban Chicago rooting for the Cubs in the 60's-70's except my team never won.
2,a bore,"This is a VERY easy read that has a few very funny moments. However, it is a trivial narrative that only a baseball fan or someone who grew up in Long Island in the fifies would be captivated by. Too cute and with little point for the rest of us, but so short that anyone could give it a shot."
3,Wait Till Next Year: A Memoir,"My book arrived quickly but was more ""beaten up"" than I expected from the product preview."
5,Wait Till Next Year,"Since I am a baseball fan I thought her love for baseball was what I could relate to. However, i am St. Louis Cardinal supporter"
5,A great book on taking your daughter to the game!,Great book. It inspires me to take my two little girls to games. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,Absorbing look at baseball ... and life,"Dr. Kearns Goodwin produced a very good book here. Her enthusiasm for her subjects - the Dodgers, her neighborhood, her friends and family - is infectious. After finishing the book I felt I knew all of the people in her neighborhood personally. The book was alternately touching, laugh-out-loud funny, and informative. I highly recommend Dr. Kearns Goodwin's book to all who love baseball ... and life."
5,Wait Till Next Year - Awesome!!,"Even as a die-hard Yankees fan, I loved this book. The author paints a beautiful picture of life in the 1950's, when baseball was purely a game and not a business. It was a pleasure going on a ride back to a more simpler time."
5,Sweet Nostalgia,"I, too, grew up on Long Island in the 50s and early 60s (two years in Queens and ten years out on ""duh oyland"".) I'm a few years younger; the Dodgers were already in Hollywood and I rooted for the hated Jankees. But the images of this beautiful memoir were so resonant with my childhood, from soothing sound of Red Barber's voice coming from the tinny transistor radio to the edicts from the diocese of Rockville Centre, read periodically in lieu of a Sunday sermon, mostly asking for more money.I have only occasionally returned to Long Island since we moved away when I was 14, and like everywhere else, it is just not the same. Ms. Goodwin's experiences are just about as close as I have ever come to going back home. For those of our generation who grew up in parts of the country other than Long Island, I believe, at least I hope, that these recollections can return you to that wonderful time the way they did for me."
5,Made me yearn for a seat in Ebbetts Field,"I completely enjyed every page of Wait Till Next Year. I must admit that I am a baseball fan who grew up on Long Island and that made this book very endearing to me. I am also a huge fan of Goodwin's other works. I am a child of the seventies though and not the fifities. Ms. Goodwin's prose, while simple, did suceed in bringing Southward Avenue to life for me. One can almost feel the excitement at Ebbetts field. It held my attention from start to finish ( I actually read the whole book on a very long plane trip) I do admit that I felt that Ms. Goodwin could have probed a bit deeper into the break up of her town as a community. I also felt a bit like the book came to an abrupt end - I wanted to find out more about the changes that took place in Rockville Center. All in all I loved the book. She truly captured an era and intertwined it with some great baseball stories. If you are at all a lover of the game it is well worth the read."
3,Damaged goods,"At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK."
2,Not as good as other canned chicken,"I have purchased numerous canned chicken products before, and of course none compare to real chicken. However, that being said, this product's quality is considerably below that of most canned chickens. Other canned chickens have large chunks of white meat, while this product is full of small discolored pieces with pieces of what appear to be skin or fat. Considering the price is also higher than the store bought competitors, I can not recommend this product."
5,Great chicken in a hurry!,"I've always been a snob when it comes to my chicken; nothing but fresh chicken would do for me. Then one day I found an amazing recipe which oddly enough, called for canned chicken. I trusted the source of the recipe so I bought a couple of cans at the store, and I am SO glad I did. This stuff is great.It's true that it doesn't have the same consistency as freshly cooked chicken. It feels more like rotisserie chicken, as it tends to fall apart very easily. This is actually great for casseroles! I prefer it over the texture of sauteed chicken.All in all, I'm very pleased with the product, so I came to Amazon and bought a whole lot of it to put in my pantry. It was delivered, for free, in two days! Thanks Amazon!"
2,Herschel Bernard sings Fiddler On The Roof,"I think I might have all the CD's and DVD's of Fiddler On The Roof. I read the other reviews, but had to have the CD to see for myself if it was as good as the reviews I had read. Well..............I don't think so, he sounds like any other singer, but nothing like the original soundtrack. I just saw ""Fiddler On The Roof"", starring John Preece as Tevye, in Birmingham, AL. at the BJCC, and I'm saying John is much, much better than Herschel (sorry Herschel). John Preece was so good, he received 3 or 4 or more standing ovations....Too bad, John doesn't have a CD, but none sound as good as the original.......that is the case in most everthing."
4,A modern Japanese Classic,"This classic is a moving portrait of a Japanese childhood. The main character, Kasuko, (the young Yashushi Inoue) is skilfully drawn and sympathetic. The book focusses on his confusions growing up in a complicated family atmosphere and his feelings towards various female members of that family, notably his adopted grandmother, with whom he lives, his absent mother and his aunt (whom he sees as an older sister). The book is readable, beautifully written and well-translated. The only shortcoming is that this is a translation only of Volume One. Volume Two appears not to have been translated at all."
3,Pinata Ink will stay on metal!,The white is bright like white out but not thick. I haven't played with them enough yet but I did color a hot fix gem with the yellow and am happy so far.
2,Not good metal at all...,"SACRED OATH is a good band... Let me say that... Just not on their first album... While the guitar work is alright, it's the terrible vocals that make this album unbearable. They sound exactly like early FATES WARNING (especially ""The Spectre Within""). Just a vocal range that's all over the place and not good... Only KING DIAMOND can pull off the falsetto-sound (and even he only sounds good sometimes)...Just get their other two albums: ""Darkness Visible"" and ""Sacred Oath"". Now those two albums are solid metal... While Rob Thorne is still singing, he's matured a ton and really toned down the 'wailing'. I know ""A Crystal Vision"" is considered a classic, but I'm not sure why (and I was there when it was released back in '87).I will say to get this album used so you can sample it for yourself..."
1,Review of Kindle edition of complete set,"This is not the complete set. It's merely volume five, The Middle Ages, and the TOC is not active. Since the complete set is fifteen volumes, it's more than a little bizarre that only volume 5 is included."
5,the class of two bands merged,"Mick Fleetwood sucked the life out of Peter Green, Bob Welch, and Christine Perfect, taking all acclaim/credit/awards as a member of the no talent Mick-and-Nicks team that was passed off as the totality of ""Fleetwood Mac""... lacking truth and soul. Sorry to see Bob suicide himself, but he did it with class again, not wanting to burden his wife with another AMA [well-practiced] back surgery botch. Give Bob Welch, Jeremy Spencer, and Peter Green credit and some earful listening if you want to feel what Fleetwood Mac lost. This and the follow-up ""Big Towne, 2061"" release show Bob's versatility."
1,Wrong Item Pictured & Sent,"Was supposed to be an album by the Bob Welch group Paris (as was pictured), instead received a coffee shop disc of songs about the city of Paris, France. Hardly the same."
3,"Nice book, but no Compact Disc included as title indicated.","This book looks fine enough for kids learning to play the guitar. I bought it for my son for Christmas, to accompany his recently new guitar. However, I was counting on the compact disc being included as stated in the title, but there was none. The book was still shrink wrapped, so I don't think it could have been taken out prior to the sale. Inquire with seller prior to purchasing."
1,Waste of money,"For starters the handle cushion started to come off after the 3rd use, not a good sign.The oil was gone after the second use.It is loud and very heavy (I guess its a plus if someone needs excercise)It takes a while to start it up (cold start) about 5-8 min, the best way to start it is press thered button 3-4 times wait 3-4 min press it again, wait again than after the 4 pull it will start.It chokes off on moderate high grass.The grass bunches up, than it gets spit out on the side, better to bag it but it still leaves a lot on the ground.Stay away from lawnboy, these new chinese wonders are JUNK!!!"
4,OK Now,works but I can only delete files when in camera. no matter where the tab is i can't delete from pcAddendum. It was me. You can delete from disc but it must be in camera attached not inserted in card reader
1,SDHC Flash Memory no recibida...,No recibí este producto!!!... como puedo hacer para reclamar que no llegó en el paquete con los demás productos entregados ese dia???
3,undesired issue,This SD card as-is from the envelope momentary reboot my notebook!Photocam takes this OK and i formattted it in cam.Now it is working greate.
1,until todayC I still have not received the goods,until todayC I still have not received the goods. why? I this sunday have to go to China. what should I do?
3,Transcend 8GB SDHC,"I originally purchased this card for use with a digital SLR. If you take images in RAW format, you know how quickly memory fills up. With an 8GB capacity the less you're swapping cards, the more photos you can take. The downside is a problem with a single card can mean the loss of a day's work. Which is exactly what happened to me. I filled the 8GB card and when I went to review the images the camera told me the card was empty. Luckily I was able to recover the photos using recovery software but the hassle was a bit much. I'll be using the card for something other than photography now."
1,"Not a ""frustration free"" experience with Transcend","I purchased this as a gift for two friends of mine who had rushed off to the hospital to have their baby early. Great capacity for a good price; perfect for taking videos and pictures. Or so I thought.The card worked fine for three pictures taken a few hours before the baby was born. Proud dad went to snap the first picture of his newborn son, and the card had died. The camera would no longer recognize it and take any pictures. Good thing he had a SanDisk card nearby.Three card readers on two different computers, and nothing could read this card. Getting a refund, and telling others to steer clear of Transcend."
4,"Good, but no case - pay a little more for the other version","I ordered a few of these for an upcoming trip to hold my pictures and other media files. They all are fine. However, I also ordered this:Transcend TS8GSDHC6-S5W 8GB SDHC6 Memory Card with Card Readerwhich I would suggest you order instead.The other option is only a few dollars more, includes the exact same 8GB memory card, but has 2 important benefits:(1) it comes with a memory card reader for easy upload to devices with a USB port and(2) it includes a case for the memory card, which this version doesn't.It's so much easier to switch between memory cards if you have somewhere safe to put them when they're not in a camera or computer, and this version doesn't offer a case."
1,What product?!,"I am disappointed in the product in that I never received it. I found a good deal on it through Amazon and elected to utilize the free super saver shipping but the package was empty. The envelope wasn't very heavy and appeared to have sustained damage and opened up sometime during shipping or processing via the USPS. Upon arrival in my mail box, it was inside a seperate ""apology"" plastic bag from the USPS with no contents. I attempted to resolve the issue through the post office and also sent an email to the vendor prior to this review but met with no success. I PAID BUT NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT - JUST AN EMPTY ENVELOPE!"
3,refund qucikly,"I ordered it during Christmas, not get it yet. but Amazon refund it quickly, I ordered another one from Amazon, It will take my another couple of days to wait. not too bad."
2,very disappointed,"Bought the 16GB thinking that I don't need to carry extra cards all the time. Started using it in my new Nikon D5000 for a week. As it reached 4GB limit, it stopped writing. I thought it may be the camera limit, tried it on my other camera, its the same problem. Thought may be I have to format it, because I never formatted since I got the card, and formatted from my laptop and thats it.The card is no longer being recognized by any of my cameras. Tried to format in different formats, like FAT/FAT32, no use. Other cards which I have from different manufacturers works great after several reformats but not this one."
3,I need a refund!,I refused delivery of this product and it was returned. I have not received a refund. Its been a month.
4,Transcend 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card,There isnt anything remarkable to say about the memory card - it is doing the job as expected. And Amazon was impressive as always with their good prices and fast/reliable delivery.
1,Card stopped working mid use,"Upon the first use it, took approx 800 photos and downloaded then all without trouble.the second time, I was had taken approx 300 photos and then after taking a shot my camera displayed ""can not read card"" I turn the camera off and on and the camera asked me if I wanted to format the card.I removed it from the camera scared I would losse my photos. Once Home I was unable to view the cards information on my PC (My PC also wanted to format the card) In the end I had to purchase a $40.00 recover card program to retrieve the lost photos (that worked luckily). So this memory card has cost a total of $68.00 and could only be used twice.I cant even reformat the card.PS. my Camera works fine with my old 4 Gb cards."
5,good sd card,It was what I ordered and came in a timely manner. I just wish it came with a case to put it in.
5,Camera Memory,I felt it was a fair price for this video card. The size allows me to take many pictures before needing to empty it.
4,SDHC Card,"This card allows for thousands of pictures with the camera, even at high resolution. I am pleased with the purchase and quickness of getting both items before Christmas. Thank you and have a wonderful day."
4,Great value,Purchased this SDHC card for my son's camera. Works great but make sure your camera can handle the HC format. Most newer cameras can. Card has fast response time for our needs. Overall very pleased. Only problem was with Amazon - order was not shipped for 5 days although it was in stock. Would have given 5 stars otherwise.
1,memory card,I do not like not like the flash card I ordered from amozon. It will not read in my computer or my HP photo printer. All I can do is look at my pictures on my camera.
1,"Thanks, Transcend!","Product failed after only a few uses, which made me lose some very important data. Thanks, Transcend! I *really* appreciate that."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,These three Transcend Class 6 SDHC 4GB cards I recently purchased work great in my NIKON D80 digital camera. I notice these cards load extremely fast in to my computer using a SDHC card reader and a USB input. I highly recommend this item for any digital camera use.
5,Works great with Nikon D60,I got this to use in my wife's Nikon D60 and it works like a champ. It's very fast and cost effective.Simple device that does what it claims.
4,Canon FS100 identifies as a class 4 and not a class 6,"Card works good, but my Canon FS100 does not recognize as a class 6 type. The higher the class the faster the transfer rate, and that is important when you are transferring 2 hours of video. Cant beat the price for 8gb now so, it will get me by for now."
5,perfect so far!,"This memory card has worked great for my Canon TX1. it shoots HD video and requires and highspeed card, and so far, everything has been great. The only thing is it takes a while to unload to whole 8g on your computer, but its not too bad. go for it!"
2,transcend 16GB,this sd card is junk. i used it taking video about 4 times and only 2 hours and it crashed on me.....waste of money in my opinion
5,someone please help me,"Transcend 8GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6E in GE X500 is a good flash memory card but i have a problem. i can`t use this. when i`m taking picture ""write protect"" < this is writting on my screen . and i also can`t delete pictures. can someone help me ?"
4,"Works, and is a bang for the buck item",Bought on a blowout sale. Does the job for my camera. Wish it was a little faster for rapid fire picture taking but it serves its purpose and was a bargain to boot. Would by again and would recommend.
1,Shipping Issue,"I'm sure this product would've been great, except it was never delivered to my home. The shipper reported the address was incorrect while it was the same exact address used for 2 other items on the same order, both of which was received. I would not order a product from this sender."
5,Fast and reliable 8GB SDHC,"Based on the specifications for class 6 SDHC memory cards I presume that his card has a speed rating of 133X or even more since my camera requires a write speed of approx 10MB per second.This 8GBs card is impressive through its flawless read and write at such high-speeds ( neither during playback nor during recording, have I experienced any glitches. I would like to note also that the audio and video have always remained in sync, and whilst in record mode, I encountered no lagging or frame drop)."
5,Inexpensive and Works Perfect!,"I was sketchy at first about buying an off-brand card, but after looking at the reviews, saw that every brand had at least a few people with bad experiences, so decided to try the Transcend card.I shot an entire 16 day vacation on just this card with a 10 megapixel camera on fine jpeg with room to spare!Absolutely no problems so far and would gladly buy another or recommend it to a friend."
4,Great price for card,"I don't understand why Canadians pay so much more for flash memory cards, this card is twice as much or more in Canadian stores. I'm glad I live close to the border so I can order stuff from Amazon. This card is being used in my Canon DSLR camera. Capacity is excellent, it holds something like 1300 photos at highest resolution. Speed is decent, but not great; if I snap maybe 3 or 4 photos in quick succession, it can sometimes pause before allowing me to shoot again. If you need speed, you might want to check out other cards, although I'm not sure how much of a difference that would make. But for me, I find it works great."
1,Card corrupt after minimal usage,"I used this card in a digital camera. During a photo shoot, the card became unusable. After investigation it was determined the card had gone corrupt. The data on the card was also unable to be recovered. While this is a pretty good price for an SD card, ""you get what you pay for."""
1,YES....ANOTHER JUNK TRANSCEND CARD!!!!,"Though not the same failure as others, but I did twice get file failures but was able to reformat the card. But the card just fell apart. Split open on one side and I again lost pictures. Now, I could say maybe I did something wrong, but I have over a dozen SD cards and have never had this problem. They all stay in one of my camera cases or a storage case. I have some no-name cheap china made cards that are far better quality. You can even feel the casing is better made on others.With all of the other problems I will just stay away from the transcend brand in the future!"
1,Another failure,"Mine lasted a little longer than most reviewers here - about 9 months and then failed for no apparent reason. My Panasonic Lumix FZ28 reports ""memory card error - parameter error"". Tried to reformat the card, which appears as 6.9Mb, but that failed too. Apparently these reviews are spot on - works great before it fails, but this is basically a lousy product. I have owned many memory cards and never had a failure before this one. I bought 2 of these - one for my grandson - his is still working, but now I'm concerned it will eventually fail also."
2,First Memory Card To Fail,"Normally, I don't write reviews on memory cards because I never had any fail on me. It always just worked with no issues. Transcend will be the first one to take the crown, but it's the ""first-to-die crown"". We had this card for about 2 years but only used it maybe 4-5 times (light use). On the 5th time, we took our camera with this Transcend card to Cozumel and it just stopped working after about 20 photos. I'm sad to report that the first half of our trip is now officially lost. Thanks Transcend. I now know why your prices are cheap."
4,"Great storage, not always compatible","Maybe it's lack of knowledge on my part, but I can only read the ocntents of this card, when it's inserted in the camera and I put the USB cable from the camera to the computer. My PC has a card reader unit and I've tried every card I have and they all work, except this one, maybe it's not suppouse to, but I find that a little frustrating 'cause I have to consume batteries to copy the photos from my camera to the PC and as it is a high capacity card it takes a lot of time and batteries to copy 1000 photos."
5,Just what i wanted,"I bought it, inserted into my pocket PC and it hasn't given me a hard time since then. That's what i wanted."
5,Fast memory card,"This memory card handles HD video from my Panasonic Lumix camera. The quality is great, and it is fast enough for the videos."
5,Hi-Speed perfect for my Lumix,The speed of the card is necessary for cameras with high resolution photos. Works perfectly on my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35. I took about 1100 photos and still have a lot of space for another 1000 more.
2,Was fine for 8 months - then died,"Bought this with my Canon FS200 video camera and it worked fine for about 8 months, then it croaked. Quit working and I tried pretty much everything to reinitialize it with no luck. Bad boot sector parameters unable to recover.Probably won't buy a Transcend for a while."
5,Lots of space,It's great that now we have the ability to add enough memory to cameras that there is no worry when vacationing about being able to keep adding shots. This 4G memory is a real boon.
5,Great as usual,I have used Transcend products in the past and as in the past their 8GB SDHC Card lives up to what I expected. Totally reliable products!!!!
4,Works fine,"I got this card over a month ago and have used it with my Canon Xsi. It has worked fine and given no trouble at all. As far as I am concerned I got exactly what I was looking for, an inexpensive reliable sdhc card."
1,"A piece of expensive plastic,","On the last day of my trip to Costa Rica I clicked the shutter on a Canon G9 and it beeped several times at me. I tried again, same response. I checked screen and it read ""Card Locked"". Back in the car I tried everything from setting and unsetting the little lock tab to a new battery. I couldn't display any of the 100 +/- photos taken, shoot anymore, or even access functions like ""format"".Back home neither of our computers recognize it as a device, and my wife's camera simply says ""no memory card"" when I try it there.All photos are lost and I am returning this ""dead piece of plastic"" tomorrow. I would love to see some statistics on how often this happens and if any brand is more reliable. Trip was great otherwise."
1,Created corrupted RAW files on G10,"When used with Canon G10, it created several corrupted files. I shot in RAW and after 15 shot, I tried to review and the picture shows up, took several more shots and when I tried to to review the previous picture that I can see before now have the big question mark on it and says ""unidentified file"". The card never left the camera! Took more pictures and then more files now has that dreaded questions mark.When I got home and uploaded the files, those with the questions mark is now corrupted (has only 1/4 size, incorrect color etc).I reformated the card several times, this same issue happened again.I sent an inquiry to transcend USA 3 days ago and hasn't got any reply.Card was formatted in camera several times before use. Camera works fine twith Kingston 6 SDHC 8GB.If they responded, I might edit this review."
1,losing data,i have a new Canon XSI and i have bought this product i have shot about a 1000 shots (for 4 days) in the desert and i didn't have access to a computer then when i went home i have had lost the first ~100 shots the computer and camera were unable to view those images...i formatted the card with the camera once and with my reader once and i have the same result
1,"Ordered May 27 08 ,Dead August 20 08 with Minimal Use!","Ordered this item on May 27 2008 for $32.25 and it died on August 20 2008. The item was used for few things with very little use during its lifetime. Only 30 day return policy by amazon. Poor!I would recommend that you buy another brand, maybe more expensive as this one did not pass the test. Good thing i always keep a copy of all my flash drives.Hope this helps you guys."
1,Worked once... quit while on vacation in Hawaii,"Tried this card out in the swimming pool in an underwater camera, and it worked fine. Shot video snorkling with sea turtles and tropical fish in Hawaii, went to download, and nothing, put it back in the camera to download from the camera, card error! Lost everything. I haven't used it since and I will attempt to recover it using the advice from other users. BOTTOM LINE- I bought this card, thinking that I needed a 4GB card- but when added to the shipping, paid $17 including shipping, I would have been better off buying two 2 GB cards from any other place (of higher quality)."
5,4gb transcend flash card,bought the transcend flash card because i wanted a tad more room on the card ..andthe price was right .. been happy with it ever since
5,Transcend 8 GB class (6) SDHC Memory card,"So far very good, fast and inexpensive using it in a Canon SD 970 for pictures and movie--no problems."
4,Transcends 4 GB SDHC Memory Card,"Very Fast high capacity, great for my new digital camera...Note your device must be able to accept the format...My Palm Tungsten would not accept it."
4,SDHC Card de 4 GB,"Muy buena y rapida tarjeta de memoria para camaras fotograficas. La utilice recientemente en un viaje a Paris, y fotografie absolutamente todo durante 8 dias y el ultimo dia fue que se lleno la memoria."
4,Excellent SDHC for digi camera,"I used this one on Nikon D60 SLR. My friend bought this one for his Panasonic point-n-shot camera and it works fine too.Pros: store 500+ photo when the setting was in RAW format, and 1K + photo when the setting was in fine format. Accessing time was good.Cons: Writing time was not as fast as Sandisk extreme III. But this one saved me lots of $$. Shipping was slow. My friend ordered his 1 day later than mine but received it 2 days earlier.Overall, this one is recommended."
5,Great little card,Am very pleased with this card. The price is the best I could find anywhere. I use it in my new cannon camcorder. Have transferred a movie to dvd and it came out great. I would highly recommend this card!
1,Pay more for reliability.,"I bought this item for my Canon Rebel T1iIt's a great memory. Very fast and excelent for the HD Movie captured by the T1i. This memory fits 80 minutes of HD video.But it lasts only 1 week.I had to RMA.I'm waiting for new unit. But the fact is: If you want a reliable unit, buy Sandisk or Kingston.Kingston - Flash memory card - 8 GB - Class 6 - SDHC"
4,SD 16GB Card,Product works great....fast and lots of room for video and pictures. Recommend this to anyone...great value for th price.
1,"Corrupts pictures, videos","Great price, but photos and videos written to this card by new Canon camera regularly became corrupted (yellow question mark appears instead of image thumbnail when trying to view on camera). Have no such problems with Lexar card."
5,A lot of space,"I was a bit skeptical at first due to the relatively unknown brand and some negative reviews. After I got it though I was really impressed with it. It can hold about 475 RAW images using my Rebel xsi. If I'm shooting JPEG Hi quality I can hold about 1300 images. Overall, I have a lot of space and it runs well. No problems with it so far. It has a great price as well. Do yourself a favor and buy this card so you don't have to swap cards out so often."
5,"good, easy, and cheap?","I got exactly what I wanted -- a simple way to take video and quickly upload it to my computer. I was surprised and delighted to see how easy it is to take video from the TV, and play it back through the TV. The quality is good -- much of the time I don't need high res video. And the price was right, coming in under $175 for both the recorder and 8 GB of Transcend memory."
2,2 expensive,"Total almost 20$, 2 expensive, not recommend! But I have no choice at that time.Buy it at local store, less than 12$!"
1,Transcend 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6E,"I do not understand because they receive this product to me? when I buy the chamber by 199,00 USD that never have said to me when it comes, 4 GB Class supplied Transcend free to me 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6E and now they receive to me what they promised free to me, I am a good client for a long time and I feel deceived....If they promise to a product it free to me do not have later to receive, also it will send a letter to the service to the client of Amazon I am not nothing contented"
3,Memory Card Problem,This product is very in-convient. It does not work very well. And sometimes a black screen pops up.
1,"This card offers a huge space, but it does not work",Neither the camera nor the PC would recognize this card. Sent email to tech support requesting assistance. 2 weeks later and still no response. Card is useless to me.
1,Beware,"I am not sure how this card got so many stars. Not only is this card so slow, also some computers don't even recognize this card. If you buy this card, make sure you are pepared to return it."
3,Not compatible with GoPro HD cameras,"The card seemed to work fine in a point and shoot camera however it is not compatible with the GoPro HD Hero series video cameras. The symptoms you will see are corrupt video files, video recordings that stop by themselves, or 'SOS' on the camera display. Switched to a brand recommended by GoPro (Kingston or Patriot) and the problem went away. I hope this saves someone else the extra expense and time consuming troubleshooting I experienced."
2,Too Expensive & Unreliable,"I can't recommend this brand of SDHC flash.I was on vacation and my entire HD videos captured on my Canon HF100 were lost without warning. I'm extremely knowledgeable when it comes to electronics & camcorders, and I was baffled. Just be careful with this card.Always reformat (or ""reinitialize"") when you put it in your camcorder.The price has actually gone up on this brand for some bizarre reason. (I bought with a USB card reader for the same price 1 year ago @ $41)."
5,Always satisfied!!!,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. I have so many memory cards and I've never had one problem. We have them in 3 cell phones, GPS, 4 Cameras (Digital SLR to pocket cameras), camcorders, digital picture frames and I am sure there are a few more I am not thinking of. This is my third ""class 6"" card and like all of the others it works great. I bought this card for a new Panasonic Lumix camera. The price was the best anywhere (by far), the shipping was fast, etc., etc., etc. 100% satisfied with Amazon, Transcend, the seller and the card."
3,"Another ""locked"" card","I bought this card for my Asus EEE, and while it works perfect in it, in my digital camera (Canon S2), it shows up as 'locked'.Unfortunately I brought the card to Argentina so it's too expensive for me to send it back to the manufacturer. Anyway, as it works on the EEE is ok to me, but double check if it works ok as soon as you receive it!."
4,Not certain what to expect...,"The card seems to work properly -- it functions as it's supposed to in both my camera and my computer. The only question I have about it is why it's called an ""8G"" card when it contains only 7.45G of memory."
1,"Didn't Work, Sent it back, Wouldn't ever buy another one.","Didn't Work, Sent it back, Wouldn't ever buy another one. Product should be pulled from being sold and all of them destroyed."
2,Possibly defective,When the chip is removed from the camera it cannot be downloaded by plugging it into the computer -- perhaps this is a Nikon thing -- proprietary so that their software must be used to download only via their software
3,Does Not Work with All SD Devices,"I bought this card, thinking that I could use it in my GPS unit. I came to find out that many ""older"" gadgets (although my GPS is less than 2 years old) will not accept the HC Class SD cards. I still do not have a gadget that takes the HC Class SD card, so I don't even know if it actually works! That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 star in my rating."
1,Dead on arrival,"The memory card was dead on arrival, so I sent it back and got my money back. Hassel free return process, but it was annoying that I didn't get a working card in time for when I needed it."
2,"Card is (probably) great, seller is ......not. $7 to ship???","Still haven't received my order yet because they sent it to somewhere in Washington, which would be fine if I didn't give a shipping address in Florida. After four days, I still have no response to my email from the third party seller, which is apparently located in rural Kazakhstan judging by what they charge to send it to you. Seven bucks for what must be among the smallest, lightest items on the entire Amazon site? Come on..."
2,Transcend SD - Not for Canon XSi,I saw a great price on the Transcend 8GB SD card and ordered it to use in my new Canon XSi Digital SLR. This SD did not record images in my XSi. I formatted the SD in the camera and tried again with the same disappointing results. All of the SanDisk SD cards have worked in the camera. And with regular rebates on the SanDisk products I'll probably stick to SanDisk's SD cards in the future.
4,It is cheap and good,"I use it in my new camera. I followed other people advices that I found here, and I low-level format the card before using it. And I don't have the problem of losing pictures like what some other people had reported. This is good enough for me.Jay Chan"
5,Good product and excellent Gb/U$ ratio,Fast memory and it basically reduces the necessity to carry a laptop around to download the pictures from your machine.
1,defective,"I used it once and found the card to be defective. Some of the pictures i put on the card were Ok but others when I tried to touch them up and resave the picture, the computer said there were errors with the card. I tried to format the card several times but without seccess. I tossed it in the drawer with the other junk I have.TIM"
1,BAD EXPERIENCE,"Work just fine for about 6 months with a Nikon D90 then in a critical shooting just died no choice to do any recovery , for now on I jut going to use SANDISK EXTREME III.Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6"
2,Card died on me,"Owned the card for 3 weeks. Got ~2000 shots, lot of which were L+RAW. Worked without problem then. While taking photos today, camera gave me ""card cannot be read"" error and the card read as if no photos had been shot. Lost all the photos that were on the card. Reformatted with Disk Utility and then camera (Rebel XS) and still wasn't reading this one. At the same time, I tried other SD cards in between and it shot fine. After reformatting several times, it works now, but I'm not going to risk it again. I understand that I might have gotten a lemon, but now I'm trying another brand.Regardless of what brand you chose, make sure you offload your photos ASAP! You never know when your card will mysteriously be unreadable!! And the larger the SD card capacity, the greater the loss if your card dies and you haven't offloaded."
2,"Fine, up to a point","I wish I had researched better before making my purchase. This card can't seem to keep up with my camera once it reaches a certain level way below its 16GB capacity. It becomes slow to write and that is not good from some of the situations I find myself in. I probably will shop around, ask some experts and invest in a more expensive card. If you are shooting 2-3MB photos and not shooting HD video, you will be fine and the price is great for that."
3,"Works, but not for all applications!","I purchased this product to use on two applications:Primarily for my camera (Canon Powershot SD600, says ""card locked"") and secondly for my computer (Dell Inspriron 6400, does not recognize card), and the card would not function on either. I wrote an enquiry on their support site and never received a reply in over two weeks.In the meantime I purchased an ASUS EEEPC notebook, and BINGO, the card worked on this machine.I believe if there are any restrictions for the card's use, there should be an explicit warning."
1,order has still not recived ...,"4/5/08 ORDER IS STILL NOT RECIVED ??? BUT I HAVE RECIVED THE CHARGE , ON MY CREAT CARD ???? RALPH FIREBAUGH ..."
1,Does not pop-out of powershot G9 camera,"Very smple: two items1.) Does not pop-out of powershot G9 camera - memory card is stuck in the camera.2.) My other camer powershot SD550, does not recognize this memory card -- dont know whether it is the camera or the memory card.."
1,Does not work with Panasonic TZ1 camera,"I bought one for my Panasonic TZ1 camera, but the camera does not recognize the card. Going to return it.The TZ1 manual says it accepts 8GB SDHC card.4/6/2008:I like to revise my review. The card works on a Casio EX-V8. So it was not the card's problem, but the Panasonic TZ1's problem.I want to give it a 5 star, but have no way to change it."
3,Watch out for compatibility,Good price for 4G capacity. It doesn't work with my Palm TX PDA and my desktop card reader but it works with my Panasonics Lumix DMC-FX07 digital camera.
1,Monumental Disappointment,"This SDHC simply does not work in ANY of devices; lifedrive, coolpix.... USB drive for SDHC cards.. A real waste of money and a monumental disappointment."
3,"Cheap, but not fast","I bought this memory card simply for the size and the price. The card holds a ton of pictures, but it's slow at writing the pictures to the memory card. When taking video, the memory card will take a long time write. No big deal, but I've definitely missed some great moments waiting for the card to finish. If you are looking for size and price this is great, but if you want speed look for something else."
4,Meets expectations,This card does exactly what it claims to do. I have had no trouble with it so far.
2,Sometimes corrupts images on Canon SD1100 IS,"I have taken 360 photos with this card on my Canon SD1100 IS. Three or four of the images have been corrupted. It is possible that my SD card reader is not compatible with SDHC cards. However I have seen corruption directly on the card via the camera's PLAY mode. It will show an ""Unidentified Image"" error message. I don't want to risk losing any more photos, so I will be buying a new SD card."
1,Never delivered,"I just never received the product and I don't know how to claim, don't have the option to make it"
1,cparqueLA,got the memory card to go with a camera i purchased. Needed it for Christmas. The card did not work in my computer nor the camera. I was disapointed since i put the card in the camera Christmas morning and it didn't work. I was out of town with no memory card leaving me with no memories of Christmas. Maybe i should have tried it sooner.
1,wrong size advertized,"Amazon has this card group for sale with the Tachyon OPS Helmet Cam, you need a micro sd card for the cam, when will Amazon find out they are putting Two products together that will not work with each other. Had to ask for a refund and then order a new one while sending the wrong one back, plus the time and trouble and wait for the refund and new card, that is why I give this product a one star"
1,"The flash card works fine, they just send me half of it...","The flash card is working fine so far, but the reason I'm giving it a one star review is because I order and paid for a 16GB flash card, and Amazon send me a 8GB one. I don't live in the US. My order was send to some relative's home in New Jersey while my wife was visiting them, and she didn't knew the details of what I had ordered. I didn't send the item back to Amazon because it would cost more to ship it back to the US than to get a new one."
4,Helpful,I tought the card was also to sotore videos from the DV but it's just to take pictures.It helps when l don't have my camera around for sure. l have not see the quality of the pictures yet but l'm sure will be fine.Shipping was fast and the packaging very easy to open!!
5,Works great!,"This card works great with my canon Camcorder. Nothing special needed, and works vast and smooth."
5,great product,I have had this in my camera for over a year now and it can take lots of pictures. Never had a problem with it and works great!
3,"Good for photos, erratic for video","I got this card for my Canon T2i (aka 550D) after careful consideration of all the positive reviews here on Amazon. It seemed like a great deal: 16GB, Class 6, and a Transcend CompactFlash card I had before had been pretty reliable. When it comes to photos, it performs well at burst rates. However, for HD video, this card is very unreliable. It overheats and will stop recording after even 2 seconds at its worst. Seems like 1080p 24fps is especially hard for this card to deal with. So, if you're going to shoot video, I highly recommend that you avoid this card. For HD video, it sounds like Sandisk Extreme cards, Class 6 and up, are best."
1,Broker after 8 months,I bought two of these Transcend 8gb cards and they busted after 8 months. I would never buy these again.
1,Never Again,"I ordered this memory card to be used on a trip to Central America. It worked while I was down there and once I arrived home, I (luckily!) was able to download most of the photos to my computer before the card began to have problems. After trying multiple avenues to try and read the pictures on the card or even to delete or clear the images from the card neither my computer nor my camera are able to read anything on the card. Corruption errors or reformatting requests pop up when I insert it into the computer.By the time I had taken my trip I was at the 30 day mark of when I purchased the card. Lesson learned for me - I won't buy a transcend again nor will I buy it online - too difficult to try and return or get a different version to replace it."
4,"Works great, no complaints","What can you say about a 4 GB flash card: it slices, it dices, it makes Persian fries? Of course not. It's a flash card that works."
1,The only card failure I've had,"In my household of five, we own 12 memory cards for various devices. I purchased this card for sole use by my camera. After a year, it failed and died. Of course, this happened after I had shot 80+ priceless photos of a memorable and emotional event. I've tried various software packages for photo recovery, and have also sent it off to a professional. It is corrupted beyond repair and no photos can be recovered. The other cards we own are Kingston and SanDisk brands. My children have used them for multiple devices, many times, and they are all older than this card. We've experienced no problems. I will never purchase Transcend again, because I'll never trust them with valuable memories."
1,Garbage,"This sd card is garbage. It got stuck in the lock position, and no matter what we try it cannot be fixed."
2,did not work,This card did not work in anything I own except for my laptop. Being a class 6 I hoped it would work in my car stereo (Phase Linear UV8020. I wouldn't recommend it unless you already knew it would work in your device!
4,Lots of space,"I liked this memory card because it offers enough space for all of my high resolution pictures.Even that it is a SD ""HC"" (High Capacity), it works smoothly in my camera and laptop, I wasn't require to purchase any special adapters."
5,No complaints,"It has only given me good results, and the fact that it is a Class 6 card is a definite plus."
5,8gb SDHC used in Canon FS-100,The Transcend SDHC card has performed well. No operations issues have arisen. It records good video and sound in the Canon FS-100 in which it is installed. Editing has proceeded smoothly. Good card for the cost.
5,Just right,"Perfect size for a SD card. I use it in my Pentax K-x and haven't had any problems whatsoever in over 3 months of use.Data transfer to and from the card is a snap. I have taken multiple videos and sequence photo shooting (at max resolution) and I haven't had any loss of quality whatsoever.It is a really great value at the asking price, so why pay more for an expensive card?"
2,Decent card but,"I bought the card for my dslr, that is the only device i used it with. After abour 8 months of use, it just stop working. There was no repairing it. I was thrilled with the card up to that point. I placed and RMA but i will buy an alternative."
5,Great for Photos AND video on my T2i,"After a lot of research which card to buy for my Canon T2i, I went with this one. You can't go wrong."
1,Don't Let This Happen to You.....,"It's great to have 8GB of memory but it is a double edged sword. Today after using this card for only the second time, it failed on me. I lost almost 200 precious images - gone forever. I am what you would call an enthusiast or hobbyist. I love photography and spend every spare minute, which is very seldom these days, pursuing my passion. So I do a fair amount of experimentation. These cards are great when they work - but if they fail you even once - the results can be catastrophic. Maybe I am the unlucky 1 of 250 reviewers with a bad experience with this product, but I feel it is my responsibility to report this to everyone. I hope it never happens to you. It is human nature for me to wonder, if I had spent a few more dollars for a better brand name, would my photos be intact today?"
5,This is a great product.....,I'm using this card in a Canon Powershot A550. It works every bit as good as it claims to. The 8 gigs of storage is especially good because I shoot a lot of videoclips with the camera as well as taking pics. I needed a card that could hold a lot of data. Also the card runs really fast.
5,Transcend to music,"This device works great for downloading songs and pictures for safe keeping, but is too big for some mini camcorders, and mp3 players."
5,"Excellent value, very fast.",Purchased this card for it's size and speed and was not disappointed with either. VERY fast transfer rates especially using a high-speed reader. No problems whatsoever in an HD Digital video camera. Highly recommended. Fantastic value.
1,Died after 2 weeks of use,"I used this card in my Canon VIXIA HF200. It worked great while it lasted, which was less 2 hours of shooting over a 2 week period. Unfortunately, I lost the majority of the footage that I shot of my newborn that I will never be able to get back. I'm sorry that I didn't look at the review breakdown on this product. Although its rated quite high overall, there's tons of 1 star reviews. Don't risk your memories on this card!"
1,Stopped functioning,"After using this in my Canon Vixia HF200 for less than a month, the card died. I'm hoping I can get it replaced or refunded. Sorely disappointed because I had some footage on there that I didn't get to take off the card before it died."
2,Should have gotten Sandisk,"I did like you are thinking of doing, saving a few bucks on a card that you think will probably work OK. I spent thousands on my vacation and thought I'd save a few bucks on a memory card. Foolish mistake. The card went blank with all my vacation shots on it. I'd give it one star, but Transcend was kind enough to send my card overseas to see if any of my vacation footage was salvageable. It wasn't. SanDisk from now on."
3,memory card error,"They seemed good for the price, but both of these developed memory card errors long before they were full, rendering them read-only; one also lost the last few pictures. I don't know whether there's a problem with the camera, but it works fine with a new memory card. Each Transcend card had been used nearly a year before refusing to take more pictures. I used them for photos and video."
4,Transcend 4GB SDHC,Good product if you have a 10.3MP camera or lower. A 14.0MP fills this memory extremely fast. It came with the purchase of a Canon 210IS and not a good match for the camera. Otherwise it's a good product.
1,Card failed after 1 week.,Card worked fine for one week then became inaccessible. Lost many pictures from family vacation. Unable to reformat card either.
3,One card died,"I had a Transcend SDHC 8 GB class 6 card, but it died an unexpected death. I have never had an SDHC card lock up on me. None of my equipment could see it, so I couldn't even reformat it. It caused myASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE-PU27-BK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook (Up to 14 Hours of Battery Life)to freeze up (I was using it there to take advantage of the Ready Boost feature) even after I took out the card, so I had to reinstall everything. It still can't see the card.I bought a new Transcend SDHC 4 GB class 6 card to use in my computer. So far, it's been working fine. Obviously, I'm hoping my experience with the 8 GB card is a fluke. I will come back to update if this happens again."
4,This should last for awhile,'Bought this card to enjoy more memory in new camera. So far so very good. Taking lots of photos and have memory to spare.
4,So far So Good!!,No problems with this memory card yet. I have had it for about a month and am happy with it overall. Lots of storage and at a class six speed. Can't beat it for the price!
4,Good Product,This product is good. Pitty no more faster only 6 MB/sec at least. I use it on my Canon S5IS in order to have more video capacity. Works great until now. I also use it on my Nikon D40x. If you are looking for more speed sure you would have to paid more.
3,Good Value,"Lot's of memory for the money. Not the fastest card out there, but it is a very good 8GB SDHC card for the price. Shipping status and tracking was a little confusing, but other than that no complaints."
5,High Capacity for my Canon Elph,I took pictures in China and at a funeral or two with my Canon Digital Elph using this high-capacity card.Fast and big. What else do you want?
4,Great Card,"This is the second one I order, they are a fantastic value. I use it in a Nikon D90 and with a Macbook Pro, no issues whatsoever and the speed is great too."
5,Great memoryt card!,Great memory card for photos. I was able to get about 950 pics at highest quality on the memory card. Good value. Just compare the price to those at any store selling memory cards!!
5,as expected,Purchased 2 8GB Transcend SDHC memory cards for trip to Costa Rica. Used in CoolpixL20 and Canon Power shot SD 1200IS cameras. Works great. Plenty of space for pictures and video.
2,failed after ~1 year,"Received this as a gift, and after a year and a couple thousand pictures, the card just failed on me (16gb transcend sdhc class 6).I put the card into our computer to offload the latest pictures, and it started showing extra directories and files with scrambled names. I proceeded to quickly get the most recent pictures transferred, but then things took a further turn for the worse as I was trying to delete the extra scrambled files. A series of cryptic error messages came up, and now neither the computer nor the camera will even recognize the card as valid anymore. Bugger.I feel lucky that this failure happened after I got our pictures off of it. Thank goodness this didn't happen when we were on vacation. All brands fail, but I'll probably go with one of the better known brands when I get a replacement."
2,get it right,it was not what i ordered. i needed this card in a class 6 as ordered not a class 10 i received. there were no return slips or return address so i'll put it to use. this has been just one bad online shopping experiances i've had since october and they have been close to horror stories
4,Gift,"I purchased this memory card together with a Nikon camera and a Logitech case. It the perfect memory card for not very large pictures and short video clips. I would recommend an 8GB memory card, though."
5,Camera Flash Memory,I bought this item from Amazon rather than Kodak. Less expensive. I now have the capability of storing video and increased my camera picture storage to over 3000.
3,"A decent memory card, I think?","I bought this to use in my Canon SD780 back in July 2009 (it is now October 2009). I haven't had any severe issues with it but, there is something I've never seen happen in my ten years of owning various digital cameras and all sorts of memory cards (is it the new card or the new camera??): After deleting pictures on the camera or transferring them to the computer, sometimes when I go to review pictures it will say that the image can not be read or can not be recognized. Puzzling! Until I get another card, I am crossing my fingers that this one holds up."
5,Transcend 8GB SDHC card,"Purchased two of these cards, came in today (10/5/09). Reading other reviews, I tried them both out. Worked great!I've always bought Kingston, but decided to try Transcend. Received memory cards very quickly.I have the Canon SX10 IS and purchased these to video an upcoming event. Does anyone know about how many minutes of video this card will take?"
2,Good Value... But Corrupt,"Yea sure Transcend is a good value.. but that is it. I had one card an 8GB that corrupted for whatever reason and was then only 4GB. I had another card that just simply wouldn't be read by anything except a dedicated card reader for that type. Camera from computer wouldn't work or Multi Card reader. A friend of mine has the same problem with her 8GB Transcend, won't read from her camera or Multi Reader, only a dedicated. I'll stick with Sandisk or Kingston. I've never had problem with them, I have 4 Sandisk and 4 Kingston. They aren't that much more. saves from having to buy another card."
4,Review SD Card 8GB,"It came in original packaging and intact. It performs as stated, couldn't be happier. Went on vacation and it performed beautifully in my Kodak camera."
1,Maybe I got the only bad one but...,"I purchased this to use with the Kodak Zi6 mini cam. When I installed this card, the cam started to lock up during playback and did it every time I used it. The cam works fine with another brand card so I assume I got a dud. At any rate, I will never buy another Transcend product."
2,Reason my Canon SLR is slow,"I bought this card because of the reviews and price, however, I'd been having a problem the last year with not being able to take consecutive pictures quickly. My camera will sometimes say ""busy"" for 1-3 seconds after I take a photo with flash. It is REALLY annoying. Especially, when I'm having to ask people to ""wait a second"" and hold the pose for another 2 seconds. It's such an expensive camera, I couldn't understand why. I also asked a ton of people, and they didn't know.I finally went to a camera class and asked the instructor at the break. He was surprised and thought it was my memory card. I needed a faster one. I just bought a sandisk extreme 3, and I will update after I use it. It wasn't that much more but may save me a lot of annoyance."
1,Card Error and data loss!,"The first time I used it - I was at Met in NYC and I was taking lots of pictures. Suddenly my camera (Canon Rebel T1i) complained of card error and asked me to reinsert the card. I turned off the camera and reinserted the card and lo! All my pictures were gone. It is so sad to lose those wonderful pictures.I am going to see if I can return this item. Maybe I just got a bad piece, but I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone!"
4,Movie capability & easier downloads,"Because of the storage space we can take pics & several minutes of video without running out of space. Also, the card goes directly into the computer for faster downloads."
2,I would have been able to rate it had I been able to buy it.,"The initial description said ""eligible for free supersaver shipping"", kept bouncing back and forth between $14.00 and $13.00 with special offers, then no special offers, free shipping, then no free shipping....when I finally got it into my cart for the right price and free shipping, it wouldn't let me buy 2 of them to reach the $25.00 minimum!!! ??????"
5,great item,i use for readyboost for my windows computer it works very well ill upgrade to a 32gb card for storage and readyboost.
1,memory card,when I ordered the memory card it said in the ad it went with the micro HD recorder and would give me hours of more memory. I was very disappointed when the card I received did not even fit in the recorder. The one needed is the micro SD Not the SDHC card. this is not how you do business.
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!!!!!,"I had done some research and decided to buy a new camera. While the camera is not the important part of this review, its the whole reason for it.Ibought the camera and this memory card was recomended to me so I bought it... BAD idea! I used this BRAND NEW card in my BRAND NEW camera to take pictures of my second daughters birth. We took about 400 photos and the card didnt respond when hooked up to the computer. So I took it to the camera store $80.00 later only 1/3 of the pictures could be rendered from their ""special software"". To make a long story short, if you get a good deal on a camera PAY EXTRA for a good card it will save you headache."
1,Not formatted for camera,I bought 2 of these and I can not use them because they are not formatted for the cameras.
1,Unreliable! Do not buy!,"I purchased a Transcend 4GB Class 6 card (TS4GSDHC6) in October, 2008 along with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ8K camera. Recently (July, 2010), after infrequent, light use, the camera started indicating errors on the card, and we lost some pictures. I replaced the card with a different brand, and the errors went away, so the problem is definitely the card, not the camera (which, btw, is a great camera). I'm outside of the Amazon full replacement period, so all I can do is ask Transcend for another card on their lifetime warranty. But I will only use the replacement card when I don't care about losing the data on it, because this card is really not reliable for anything important."
2,Problems with formatting,"Practically, I had to format this item on my computer. It came unformatted. That irked me."
4,Faster than Kingston,"I have both, this and the Kingston class6 8GB. The Transcend was a little faster on file tranfer in my toshiba notebook. I got some read erros when trying to copy some video made on panasonic tz5, but I format the card in camera and the problems were solved."
4,Solid and cheap,What's to say... my 4GB Transcend is a solidly fast and very cheap Class 6 card. My Nikon D40 doesn't miss a shot. I'll buy again if I need an extra for the road.
5,Good value!,"Fast, works perfectly. What more can you ask for?! I will definitely be buying more of these."
4,Great Value,We purchased these extra cards to use for the office and the membership. The prices were great and we received them promptly.
5,8GB SDHC Major upgrade,"For replacing the stock (SD)memory(32MB) in my Canon 590is. This was a real money saver for me. I strongly recommend it, But check your camera to see if it's able to function with (SDHC)."
4,Transcend 8GB SDHC,"Great product. Had a little problem getting my Asus A626 to recognize it, but that was a problem with the PDA. Very impressed."
1,Failed in less than 6 months,"I was initially satisfied with the item, but it failed completely less than six months after purchase, with sporadic use. Since I'm outside the US, it's cheaper for me to buy a new card than to pay for the kind of shipping that would get the item to the manufacturer in the time limit set by them to return it after a request is opened with their customer support service."
5,GREAT,"I haven't had any problems with my card, it works great. A little less than 15 GB is actually usable in my camera but that's to be expected. Would purchase again."
3,Not bad,"Fit right into my SD-only camcorder and it's got tons of room for more videos. Plus, this was the best deal I found online. So it's cheap and has a large capacity.Unfortunately, I think the card is to blame for taking a decent HD video I took and making it choppy and jumpy. I'm not sure whether it was the card or not, but being that the video played back great on the camera and the card was the only link between the camera and the computer, I'm going to assume it was the card."
1,I must be a dummy,"I'm not really sure how this thing works. I'm not literate when it comes to equipment like this, but I couldn't get anything to record on this card right out of the box. Am I supposed to do something with it first, before I can record anything? The directions are horrible and don't make any sense. As I admitted, I am not literate, but I think I can pretty much figure things out. This issue, I can not. Does anybody have any suggestions so I can change my rating on this?I put the card right into my camera, as well as my computer and it doesn't read anything and doesn't even acknowledge that it is there. I feel like I wasted my money up to this point."
1,Frustration-free Packaging Wasn't,"My SDHC card was stolen somewhere within Amazon's shipping department. The outer packaging with my address had not been tampered with nor was it damaged. Inside was the recyclable square package with a zip tab opener that was torn off. Inside were three Transcend pieces of paperwork and my receipt. I checked carefully to see if the actual SDHC card had been inserted without the small plastic case standard for all such cards. Nothing. I opted for the Frustration-Free Packaging to do my bit to Support Green. Never again.The icing on the cake was the standard ""sorry it has not arrived, it must have been lost in shipping, we have issued a refund"" in response to my request for a replacement along with the explanation as above. Apparently Customer Service does not read its emails."
4,Benchmark results,"Using CrystalDiskMark 3.0.1 I get the below results. I've added all my benchmarks for comparison. I'm not doing this professionally. I was probably like you and curious about the actual performance so I downloaded free benchmark software and ran a few tests.Team 16GB SDHC Class 10Seq: 15.33 MB/s Read, 13.93 MB/s Write512K: 15.19 MB/s Read, 4.183 MB/s Write4K: 3.364 MB/s Read, 0.549 MB/s Write4K QD32: 3.233 MB/s Read, 0.515 MB/s WriteTranscend 8GB SDHC Class 6Seq: 14.52 MB/s Read, 11.78 MB/s Write512K: 13.98 MB/s Read, 1.207 MB/s Write4K: 1.343 MB/s Read, 0.025 MB/s Write4K QD32: 1.493 Read, 0.042 MB/s WriteLexar Platinum II SDHC 8GB Class 6Seq: 15.53 MB/s Read, 9.547 MB/s Write512K: 15.59 MB/s Read, 0.659 MB/s Write4K: 6.411 MB/s Read, 0.006 MB/s Write4K 32QD: 6.287 MB/s Read, 0.006 MB/s Write"
1,manufacture defect,"The Transcent 8gb card I received was defect, and no camera or computer could find the card when I inserted it. I bought it in California and returned to work with it to Shanghai - so I have no way to sent it back."
5,This is the one to buy!,Transcend's memory has never done me wrong. I've got some that are a few years old and are still working. This card does everything it says it does. It is a true class 6. I've wasted my time and money on memory cards from eBay that turned out to be fakes. Amazon had an unbeatable price and fast shipping.
3,"Bought 3, but one had someone else's files on it, later one died.","I've bought 3 of these over time.The first worked great, so I ordered 2 more. One of the two unfortunately had someone else's music files on it already, thus it was clearly pre-owned. Presumably they bought it and returned it and Amazon or Transcend did not bother to erase it. I paid for a new product so I returned the used one.In addition, one of the two remaining died within 6 months of purchase.Finally I did a speed test of the remaining SD card. Despite the official claim that this is a Class 6 card, it only wrote at 4.7 MB per second, meaning it is actually a Class 4 card. My speed tests are at infrared dot tk.In short, don't trust Transcend."
1,Card was defective on delivery,"It is difficult to write a review for a product that did not work. At all. It was not recognized by my dSLR. Now what made a possibly bad situation worse, in this case, was the fact that this was a new dSLR, and I was trying it out for the first time. So I was not sure if it was the dSLR or the card that was defective. I therefore got an 8GB card from Circuit City (this was in 2008, before the bankruptcy) and tried it with the camera, where it worked, thereby ruling out a problem with the camera, much to my relief.On the positive, Amazon was prompt in accepting the return and applying the credit to my card."
3,Gave me a big scare at first,"I am updating the review, giving it more credit than I did in the past version. I still find it odd my camera's counter shows me less photos available for this 4 GB card than other 4GB cards I've used.The big scare I had was the last day of a trip. All of a sudden I got an error from my camera telling me I had no card available and that it needed to be formatted. My heart sunk and I panicked. After several tries and inserting the card into someone else's camera, it fixed the problem. I was able to get the images downloaded to my computer. The card is still useful, though isn't my main one for that reason. I recently found another cheap card with the same problem. It appears to be something that happens if I take some cards and use them without formatting them in the camera first. After it is formatted it appears to be working, for now..."
1,Stopped working after 6 months :(,I thought that the card was great and it was until it stopped working. The card is completely dead and I lost a lot of pictures. it didnt get wet or anything and now my camera nor my computer will read it. this made me very angry!
1,Will not work with ReadyBoost on Asus 1005PR,"I bought this to use in my new Asus 1005PR in the SD slot for ReadyBoost. It failed the speed tests not matter what I did... and I did everything from full format NTFS, to setting the SD driver for increased performance to compressing, all of which others on the web said might get a non speed conforming SD card up to ReadyBoost standards, all of which failed.I suppose this is a good price for an SD of this size, but if you are looking to use this for ReadyBoost you need to go with a higher speed memory."
1,Should Have Bought a Sandisk - card failed on first and subsequent uses,"This card failed on first full use - the first day of my holiday - and again on subsequent uses in a camera compatible with 16G SDHC cards. I was able to download the photos that had been taken up until the point at which the error occurred.Errors were at multiple points on the card - 6.2G initially then after a reformat at 9.4G. This time removing and replacing the card and camera battery revived the card, but it failed again at 9.4G and stayed dead. Again though I could retrieve the photos using a card reader.The card did compare well to a Sandisk 4G Class 6 SDHC card on speed testing - both took 42 shots in 40s on a Canon Powershot G11.Back to Sandisk. I guess the reliability of the Sandisk cards justifies the extra cost."
5,"Affordable SDHC card, great performance",I bought this SDHC card for my Canon point and shoot and have not had any problems with it. The card is reliable and the transfer speeds are fast.
1,Another Disappointed Customer,Add me to the list of purchasers who report using the card for a limited amount of time--in this case for about a month and perhaps five or six separate days of shooting video--and then having it fail. Would advise potential customers to choose a different manufacturer.
1,throws read error on first day use itself,I went on a trip. Full day i clicked beautiful pictures and in the evening suddenly this card started throwing read error and became unusable.Peice of crap.
1,3rd time a dud,"I had this card (but Class 10 instead of 6) and never had a problem. I have just received my third replacement of the ""class 6"" card, took 5 photos and when I looked back at them I received ""Unientified Image"" again. The first card I had failed after a day at the aquarium with our 20 month old. Lots of cool videos gone. Returning this and will try class 10 (even though my cam takes both)"
2,Doesnt work in my ipaq,"It works in my computer flash slot, but doesnt work in my pocket pc, bad HD memory"
4,SDHC is awesome,"I have a Canon TX1 and i record a lot of video. Saving the video is quick and fast thanks to the class 6 on this SDHC card, i have just seconds to wait while a video is being saved. I would recommend this card to everyone. Not to mention it can hold about 1500 pictures if they were all in shot in HD."
5,Works Great,Not too much to say. My order was fulfilled accurately and on time. The card worked in the camera with no problems. Its the second one of this brand and size I've ordered. I'd order it again if needed.
5,3 of Transcend 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6,"Very fast service. Came new in sealed package. Very satisfied. Thanks! Can't beat this deal. Work well in camera, recorders."
5,Easy-open packaging is great!,Fast memory card (class 6). The frustration-free packaging is worth the extra couple of bucks. Price has dropped $2 since my purchase. I'm in for a couple more.
1,Card is bad,"Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]I bought this memory card and turned out to be corrupt. Keeps giving ""memory card error"" with my canon powershot sx 20is"
4,good value,The cards have really dropped in price over the years. Much cheaper than when they started. Also stay with a name brand (or top rated) product. Have not had any problems with any of these cards. Great value for the money. I grew up in the old analog (film world). This technology is amazing to me. Much cheaper plus I can view my pictures immediately.
3,So-So,"The card works fine while taking pictures, but for some reason when I put the actual card into the slot on the computer it won't read it & freezes the computer. Luckily no pictures were lost & we were able to use the USB cord for the camera to upload & save the pictures from the card, but after reading the negative reviews we're now worried it might eventually stop working all together & we'll lose our precious newborn baby's pictures! That would be devastating.. for now though it seems to be storing photos just fine, but I think we're going to purchase a Sandisc card to use for baby pictures."
5,Works fine :),ordered this with the digital camera (point and shoot).No issues for the camera in recognizing the card. Will recommend for buying.
5,Photos to go!,I use three of these in my digital cameras for both still images and video. They never fail to perform flawlessly! Trust Transcend!
1,---------------Do not Buy---------,Transcend gets 'image can not be read'. Did low-level formatting multiple times with no effect. Its not even good as a backup. Sandisk works perfectly with Canon T1i.
5,Don't try to buy one of these on eBay! You might also need,"First, the card works great. I used it to capture HD video and zero problems.I was ready to buy one on eBay, from China for a third of the price. I questioned how the price could be so much lower so I looked at the feedback. The seller had 1000's of FB reviews and over 98% positive. But I noticed the negative FB reviews were virtually all for 16 and 32 Gig SDHC cards. The complaint was that the cards provided less than 8 gigs of storage and the speed of the card wouldn't allow smooth video recordings.Google: 16 Gig SDHC problems You'll find a LOT of unhappy people that bought junk cardsOH, one last thing. My 5 year old computer and 6-way card reader would not recognize this card. Turns out while the SDHC card looks the same as an SD card it's technically very different. So if you've got an older computer you may need an sdhc to USB adapter like this:[...]"
5,Solid product,"Works fine with my cowon mp3 player, linux laptop, and windows desktop via a card reader. One thing to keep in mind older devices may be limited to seeing this as only 4G. It's not an issue with the card, but an issue with the other device."
5,IT REALLY WORKS WITH SDHC COMPATABLE DEVICES,YES IT WORKS I WAS AFRAID IT DIDNT WORK SO I TRIED IT ONCE IT ARRIVED AND IT WORKS WITH MY CAMERA(BUT BE SURE TO BE SDHC COMBATABLE OR IT WONT WORK)
1,Very disappointed!,I bought 3 of these. 2 of the 3 could not even be formatted. Not worth the hassle of returning.
4,Fast and Accurate,"I purchased this memory card for use in my Canon Vixia HD camcorder and have been impressed with the card's access speed. It's easy to use, fits the bill, and is about 2x as fast as using internal camera memory for exporting raw video files onto the computer."
1,Lost Memories,"I normally don't write reviews, but I was looking for a new SDHC card and this card came up first in my Amazon search and I remembered the horrors. I brought this along with my Nikon D90. It worked fine at first, then one not so good evening on the last day of my 3 week long family vacation in Asia trekking thru 6 countries and 9 cities, it just stopped working, camera can't read it, computer can't read it, and all pictures that were there were lost. The only pics left from our trip was on the little point and shoot I brought along. I guess what they say is true, you don't need pictures just memories...Upon my return, I called Transcend and all they can offer is a RMA for replacement. I sent them the replacement via USPS and was told they never recieved it. I should of paid the extra buck for USPS tracking but after losing all the pictures I didn't really care for this card anymore.Be careful !!!"
5,I have tried a few others & I will stick to trancend.,I started out with Trancend tried a few other cards in between & I am sticking with Transend 16gb. The Quality does drop but after several deleting of pics only.
2,never arrived to my hands,"I bought this SD memory around first days of December, is December 26th and the status of this stuff is ""in Transit"" I do not understand what that's really mean, but I think that I will never get it..."
1,Never Received the chips,"Never received the chips, or a response from the company I bought them from, even after three emails.... Never again will I buy from Second Party Company's....."
3,Why not include handy software programs on flash cards!,"For the Zoom H2, H4n, H1, and Q3 you should include handy software encoders like Vortex Zoom and Surround encoders, MP3 surround and HD encoders all made by Immersive Media Research: www.im-research.com"
5,Great value!,Card works flawlessly! What else can I say about it that hasn't already been said! I can fit 1900+ pictures on this little guy and I will probably never need another SD card. All that and at a fraction of the cost of a Panasonic brand SDHC card! I would recommend this to anyone with a SDHC compatible device.
3,Cheap Card,"I have used this card for a few days and it already created corrupted photos twice in my Kodak camera even after formatting.Since the card was so cheap($10) I will keep it as a backup,my Sandisk Ultra II cards have never given me any problems.UPDATE(11/15):Well it seems the card works great in my Palm Treo and for transferring files between my PC and laptop.If you are using WinXP you need to download the SDHC hotfix or install SP3."
4,Memory card - slow,"I had been using the memory card that came with my Canon Powershot for 1 year. It didn't hold many pictures, but it worked well. This card will take about 1800 (8MP) pictures on my camera. But the write speed is slow. Much slower than the card that came with my camera. There is about a 5-second writing delay, while the other one takes about 2-seconds."
5,Great Product!!!,"I have been using this card for the past 8 months, and it is working great!!!I am using it on my Sony DSC-HX100V, and the writing speed for HD Videos is awesome!!!"
4,Seems Like a Quality Card,"I purchased this SD Card for my Panasonic digital camera, and have used it almost a month now with no troubles, including sticking it in my computer to transfer pictures off. I can't think of a single issue I have had so the card must be working seamlessly."
5,Great!,Getting a spare memory card is a must for me. This one was perfect for our need and was a great deal.
3,At least it is cheap...,"I bought this product and found out quickly that the locking mechanism is easily switched. Whenever i would put it into my camera it would switch it to lock mode. Impeding me to take pictures or to delete pictures. After about 3 tries of putting the card in, it would finally not lock. This would happen every time that I would take the card out and try to put it back in. Other then the locking mechanism, I like the memory card."
5,The memory market faster,"compared to other brands this is the fastest SDHC memory you can find, you arrived in a plastic box and blisster its case, the purchase for use with a camera and really fast loading photos."
1,Write Protect Error,"I started getting the write protect error right after I took the card out to download pictures for the first time. Seemed that the edge of the card, with the write protect tab, was rubbing against the edge of the compartment and engaging when I tried to put the card back into the camera. I was able to finagle it a few times but eventually, the lock tab broke off and now I can't write to it at all. Fortunately, I can still read the pictures that are stored on it. I'm dumping them to my Mac and then throwing this card out. Won't buy this brand again."
5,Fantastic card. Fast! Works in Canon SD1100 and Thinkpad X61,"Fantastic card. It works as advertised in my new Canon SD1100 camera and can be read from and written to by my Lenovo Thinkpad X61. As a side note, it seems faster (opening and saving files) than many of my older and smaller SD cards."
2,Caution...,"I ordered this product to take on my honeymoon. Halfway through, my digital camera stopped reading it and all pictures were lost. I sent the product back and received a replacement. Thus far, I have not had an issue. But if you are planning on using this card for important pictures, I would purchase a more dependable brand."
1,do not buy,"Bought this card at the end of 2008 but only used it couple times since, so I go to us it in my new camera I bought from Amazon and guess what message on camera tells me that card is locked, tried unlocking it 20 times doesnt help put it is my laptop same shhhit so I wouldn't buy it or recommend it to anyone it suuuuucks TRANSCEND never again spent an extra 5 more dollars and but something better."
1,8GB Class 6 dead. No warning.,"Dead after 14 Months. No warning!Have switched to Sandisc Extreme.Glad I had a backup of the RAW photos!If your photos are very important or have commercial value stick with the Sandisc or other pro quality media. Panasonic, Lexar.Warranty is for two years... I will advise how well or not Transcend does!I sent this off to transcend. They responded by telling me it was an apparent counterfeit.!! This came from Amazon. The seller failed to make good on it and Amazon is party to this fraud too.I don't know who to believe either! Could it be that trancend just doesn't stand behind their product.. or is Amazon doing a shit job of vetting vendors??No more trancend for me nor the vendor. I will stick with sandisk. U can't give a zero rating otherwise i would!"
3,Nice card but slower than the comparable Sandisk,"I ordered this card for it's affordable price with the class 6 designation for optimal transfer speed. After trying reads and writes of many files to and from this card and comparing that to a class 6 Sandisk card I found the sandisk to be about 20% faster on both reads and writes. This was not a fluke either as I actually purchased and tested 2 of these 4gb cards. My saves to this card from a Windows 7 computer averaged 5MB per second while the Sandisk averaged 6.5MB per second. On reads, the Transcend averaged 10MB per second while the Sandisk averaged 13MB per second."
3,A nice card with a little problem,"I bought this card as part of a package with my Canon camera. It works well in the camera. Whoever, I cannot seem to get any on my computers to read the card directly. Not a big problem. But it is an annoyance. This means I have to dig out my USB cable, and hook it up to the camera. I think this may be related to the cards HC rating."
2,limited functionality on older equipment,This 8GB card works only in a new EeePC. It does not work in an older HP Pavilion notebook PC or in a Samsung 6.0 Megapixel digital camera. I had hoped to be able to use it to transfer data between my notebooks but it will not :-(
1,Memory Card,"It does not work. This the first time that I have ever purchased anything from Amazon, and I was not pleased with the product. I found out that this item did not work too late after the deadline to return it. I placed it in my camcorder a few days after it arrived. I tried to work my camcorder, and nothing happened."
1,suddenly I have a 12 Gbytes card! :-(,"I recently purchase this product 2 months ago, works fine for 1 month; but suddenly it was 4 gbytes lost!.I don't know what happen, now I'm the proudly owner of a piece of High Technology with 12 Gbytes working and 4 Gbytes hidden.It was the last time that I bought something from this brand."
1,Card Completely Died After A Few Months,The card has worked fine for the past few months. I turned on my camera this evening and my camera gave an error saying it needed to be formatted. Luckily I only lost the last 10 or so pictures I'd taken but it was annoying to have the card die so soon. This card has tons of reviews and a very high rating so I may have just gotten a dud. I'm trying another Transcend model to see if I get better results.
1,failure,"I purchased the Transcend 16Gb last August. It failed in May of 2009. I lost all the video and photos associated with this large 16Gb card. Never had trouble before, just a complete failure one day. I carried it with two 8Gb cards from another manufacturer and they did not fail. Hence, this card was not subject to anything that other cards could cope with. Regretful, I liked the size and speed."
5,FAST and great storage capacity,"I am VERY pleased by the speed and reliability of these Transcend SDHC Flash Cards (i got 2X)... good price and delivered quickly... i was going to buy a cheaper card at first, but to save a few dollars i am happy i didn't... Transcend is a good reliable company... i do not want to take a chance on loosing any of my photos as all can eventually be priceless... if you have ever had a card go bad, you know what i mean... if you haven't, like me, i hope we never have to experience it (knocking on wood)... spend a little more for reliability..."
1,lost video,"I purchased this and it came very fast. I used it for my oldest Child's pre-K graduation. I took a 10minute video and when I went to retreive it from the camera, it was gone. I formatted the memory card as I was supposed to per the camera instructions. I then used a memory restorer that I had to purchase and it found it but it still can't play the file. Besides losing the video, everything else has worked and the capacity is excellent. If I could get back the video somehow I would give this 5 stars."
2,Fast Card which Failed Me,"Loved it for 3 months, fast, cheap, perfect. Then it lost 200 images, luckily not critical. I suspected a problem. Then I went on vacation, had to come home for something else, and uploaded the pictures. Out of maybe 300, it transfered 10 or so and then everything just dissappeared. No images on Disk. Not happy. Luckiliy it wasn't a wedding or something.I have a Nikon D80, and it works great with my other cards. The Transcend is tagged for destruction unless I can return it or something."
3,"Large capacity, but beware duds","I have purchased three of these 16GB SDHC cards, two of which I have had to return due to problems reading them. The one good one is excellent though - nice and quick and works well in my PS3, camera and laptop.I suggest that if you do order a Transcend 16GB card, you thoroughly test it as soon as you get it. I'd suggest trying it in all the devices it may need to work in and also doing a surface scan with something like chkdsk (use the /f /r options). If it has any bad sectors, send it right back as it will probably be unreliable."
1,Went bad after 1 year,"Had this card for about a year, and it worked well until 2 days ago. I had it in my Nikon D5000 and got the error, ""Unable to Format Card. Card May Be Defective."" Luckily I found a utility online to recover the pictures I had and I was able to re-format the card. It worked for another day and now I'm getting the error again.I tried cleaning the contacts w/ a cotton swab, and even tried inserting the card while locked & unlocked - didn't make a difference. Hopefully, theSanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-016G-P31, Retail Packaging) - NEW 30MB/s versionI just bought will last longer."
1,Do Not Buy This Memory Card!,"I bought this card just before vacation for its high capacity, and filled it with pics and videos while I was away. After I filled it, I stopped at a store and bought another 16GB SDHC card made by PNY so I could continue taking photos. When I got home I uploaded the pics from the PNY card, switched to this Transcend card, and tried to upload the pics from it. The software, however, showed no pictures on the card. I tried the windows camera software, but that didn't work either. I downloaded a memory card recovery utility and tried to scan the card for any sign of the pictures. Nothing. All sectors on the card came up bad. Devastating.Purchase this card to your own peril! I have been using digital cameras since they were invented and never has this happened to me before. The feeling of loss I feel will not be erased by the refund I get when I send it back. I can't believe this!"
1,"Failed after 10 months, lost video and photos","I used this card in my HD video camera, and it died after 10 months. I lost several weeks of videos and photos."
5,Great performing card at a great price.,"SDHC cards are now amazingly cheap, so if your device can handle it, it doesn't make sense to go smaller. This card performs very quickly in a Panasonic TZ5 camera. There is only minimal delay when capturing 9M stills or HD video. As usual, great service from Amazon."
3,defective within 5 month,"I bought this SDHC card for my panasonic Lumix TZ5 digital camera. At the first 5 month this card works well and suddenly this card defective and can not read, disappointed about the quality."
5,Transcend 8GB SDHC CARD (Class 6),"This memory card is awesome! Great price too, although I paid a bit more when I bought mine. The Amazon.com price sure has dropped in the last 4 months! I used it in my Finepix digital camera on a recent cruise to Alaska. It held 2 hours and 23 minutes of video and 278 hi-res photos and still had room to spare. Being class 6, it saves VERY quickly. I highly recommend! I'll be buying another for our Hawaii cruise this fall, just as a spare."
5,"great card, great price","I tried this card on a canon powershot camera, a nikon coolpix camera, and on my laptop. Works like a charm. My older desktop PC can't recognize the card, but I assume it is a PC issue and not anything wrong with the memory card.I looked around and this was definitely a good deal for a 16GB class 6 card."
5,Good,I got a 16gb card for my Canon Vixia HF200. Works great so far. Speed class was 6 and my camcorder confirmed that it was correct.
2,bad packaging,This item read that it is in a retail package. An envelope with a upc sticker on the outside is not a retail package to me.
1,NEVER RECEIVED ITEMS,THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD ON AMAZON YET. I WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSE TO RECEIVE THIS ITEM AS PART OF THE CYBER MONDAY DEAL THAT AMAZON WAS HAVING. I BOUGHT A CANNON A495 WHICH WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A FREE MEMORY CARD. WELL MY ORDER CAME IN EXCEPT THERE WAS NO MEMORY CARD. SO I CALLED AMAZON THREE TIMES AND THEY KEPT GIVING ME THE SAME SOB STORY THAT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. THE FINAL TIME I CALLED I SPOKE TO ONE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES NAMED SARAH WHO SAID THEY WOULD HELP. THEY TOLD ME I SHOULD REORDER THE MEMORY CARD AND THEY WOULD REFUND MY MONEY ONCE IT CAME IN. WELL I DID EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID I RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH A TRACKING NUMBER. WHEN I USED THE TRACKING NUMBER IT SAID THE PACKAGE WAS ALREADY DELIVERED BUT I NEVER RECEIVED IT. SO HERE I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW BECAUSE AMAZON AND THIS SELLER FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN.
1,Absolutely horrible!,"I bought a 16GB Transcend SDHC Class 6 card for my Olympus SP-800UZ. It worked fine when I tested it before my trip to Washington DC. I formatted the card in my camera and also took pictures to make sure the card is good. Throughout my 2 day trip, everything was fine. I took about 300 photos. But when I returned and put the card in my PC's card reader, it made my computer sluggish and from then on, I could not access the card and the PC only recognized it as a 512KB card. Contacted Transcend. They replied with a standard answer and a freeware for recovering files. Did not work. I emailed back and I didn't hear from them again. Now, I'm trying to format it, but even then, I can't detect the card anymore.This is the worst experience I have with a flash card. Will definitely skip Transcend and stick to my other trusted brands in future."
1,Transcend SD card is of no use unless you have camera which uses Transcend card.,"I am writing this review so no gets fooled and buys a ""transcend memory card along with Sony DPF"" the reason is if you have a sony camera it uses separate memory card which can be directly inerted into the sony DPF. I bought this Transcend memory card but there is no way I can save the pictures from my computer to this transcend SDHc card. This is complete waste of money for me as I have no other product I can use this card for. I also do not have a memory card reader. Please do not buy this card unless you have a compatible camera in which this memory card fits. Transcend SDHC memory card does not fit for any SONY camera."
1,You suggested wrong accessory,The micro disk was the wrong size yet you suggested it for my main purchase. The one should have been the MICRO DISK. Now I am stuck with a disk that is too large for my product!!!
1,Transcend Memory Card,Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6I'm very dissatisfied - I have never received the items and there doesn't seem to be any customer service available to help me. I've been billed no problem.. They tried to track it and no one knows where it is.. So I'm not to happy and I cannot rate or give a review on a item I never received.HELP!!!
5,I didn't order the item.,"I can't review the item as I have no idea what Flash Memory Cards are as I didn't order the product and returned it without opening it. I ended up with the Flash Memory Cards and not the book I thought I had ordered as Amazon provided incorrect information to the seller. Note to all: Check your order Amazon confirmation ASAP. This review process requires that in order to have my review posted, I have to rate the product. Even though I have no experience with the product, I chose to rate it a 5 so as to avoid any negativity around the seller, who was great at rectifying Amazon's error."
2,Defective card shipped,"I've used Transcend SD cards in the past with mixed results. This particular card had a complete loss of data & formatting several times in my Canon XSi, which was of course very frustrating because I lost all my pictures. Fortunately it failed early in the shoot and I switched to a much higher-quality PNY SDHC card, which has always been reliable, but had I been shooting with live subjects it would have been quite embarassing. My only option, unfortunately, is to return the card under warranty to Transcend for a replacement. The problem there is that I don't really want a replacement, but that's what I get for buying a cheap card. I'll have to use it somewhere non-critical."
1,Labeled Class 6? Better check.,"I purchased this card because I needed the record speed found in Class 6 cards. However, when I received the card and checked the internal information of it, I found that it was in fact a Class 4 card labeled as a Class 6 one. Transcend did not return my email concerning this issue."
1,Affordable 16GB SDHC card that just stopped working after 4 months,I wanted a reliable 16 GB SDHC card to create an emergency bootable disk for my MacBook Pro. This one provides enough space for the operating system (without the printer drivers and language support) and some additional diagnostic tools. I also purchased a second one to use with Time Machine. The big but is that after four months of minimal use they both just stopped working. I was unable to access them with my Mac or with file recovery software or even reformat them. Would strongly recommend a more reliable brand.
4,Seems as fast as necessary,"I picked up this card with my Earthmate PN-40 GPS unit. The 16 GB is enough to put all the topographic data (from Delorme) for 2 or 3 states on it. There have been no problems reading and saving to the memory card, and it seems to be as fast as one could want. The only caveat is that this card will not work in some older devices like my TREO 750wx."
4,Great value,"I got this to add storage to my Eee PC. Works great and is very fast. I haven't benchmarked it, but there is not much noticeable difference between it and the internal ssd. Great for storing multimedia and data. I can easily swap between my eee, laptop and digital camera with no problems."
3,good for price,"this is my first transcend card. it seemed nice and cheap and had pretty good reviews (i.e. bang for your buck type deal) compared to other brand names. i also formatted it to my canon camera before use as someone had suggested for ""better compatibility"". anyhow, after some use (pics, videos, transfers to comp) everything seems to work fine except it didn't recognize a couple of my pics and couldn't display it for some reason (even though one of the thumbnail was shown??.. weird) luckily they weren't crucial pics so i just deleted them. otherwise it's not bad. i'm not sure how well the other ""higher end"" cards work, but like the title says this one is good for the price. good luck!"
5,Fast and cheap!,"This SDHC card hasn't let me down! I've been using it non-stop for my BeagleBoard, taking it in and out and in and out, formatting it quite a few times, and it's still going after a month. Plus, you can't beat the price (at the time of this writing). Oh, and the speeds are really nice."
4,Very good,I bought this last month and have used it in my camera and my ASUS EEE PC. It works much faster than my 1 GB SD card and I am very happy with it.
5,"No problems, good!","There isn't much to say, it's a 4GB memory card. I like it, there have been no problems so far."
4,Excellent Value,"I was skeptical due to the price, but I ordered one since the value seemed too good to ignore. I immediately formatted per the instructions and it is working beautifully (will advise if any troubles come later). Excellent buy."
5,Transcend TS4GSDHC6 4GB SDHC SD 2.0 SPD Class 6 Card,The review article another person wrote aboute the differences between SD and SDHC6 chips was extreamly help full and the main reason I selected this chip. For less then $7.00 it's a top line chip and can cost 4 to 5 times as much in other brands. I formatted it as recommended and so far it has been doing a great job for me. With this chip I set my camera on 8 mpxl and still have tons of room.
1,Wrong card for my camera,"This card is for special devices that take a super high capacity SD card. I don't think the description had sufficient disclaimer because most SD cards are universally compatible with one another.Now I'm out $14, have a card I can't use, and of course I can't return it because my kid tore the package open before we realized the mistake. Amazon can do a better job to prevent this type of mistake."
2,mistake,"This purchase was a mistake. I mistakenly read 8GB, when I should have seen 8MB, so I cannot even use this product for the purpose intended."
1,Not working,This item was not working when got it so i am letting you know that do not purchaase from this dealer there product is no good.
3,Digital cam card,"This card is great because it has a lot of GB, however, I encounter many problems with it trying to develop pictures or reading it in certain computers, unlike the regular old fashion cards that are readable in any computer. I also had problems when I took the card to Wolfe Cameras to develop a picture and their machines could not read the card as well...I am not happy with it and use it only when I run out of space in my other cards."
5,SDHC card,"It is in great condition. The only problem is, it is much thicker than a regular SD card, so I can not use it in my camera or my digital photo display. I will need to get an adapter to use it with my computer. But it was such a good price, it will be good for storage of files from my PC after I get an adapter."
5,works fine,This does exactly what it is supposed to and costs much less than similar products purchased at a brick and mortar.
3,Not too happy...,I don't know if I am doing anything wrong or not but I can not get the pictures off of this card without keeping the card in the camera. I have had several of the same types of memory cards in the past and all I would have to do is plug the card into my computer and download the images that way. On the postive side you really can put a lot of high quality images onto the card.
5,Worth it,"For 4GB of memory, the price is worth it. Most memory cards are interchangable anyway, so brand is not much of a factor. A good product for a good price = a good buy."
4,So far so good!,1 month and the memory hasn't failed - Plenty of room for movies and pictures! Great value.
4,Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card,Works fine delivered quickly. Downside is the uint I purchased it for does not accept the high capacity disc.
5,wow,I bought the 8GB card and i use it on my 10mp digital camera and WOW it holds a little over 4000 pictures! it was a great buy for a low price
2,complaint,"I bought this item with a camera a month ago. Just after taking 20 pictures, any picture i take they tell me ""card cannot be read"". Now i hv no use for it and have to buy another memory card. I don't advice anyone to purchase this item.It is waste of money and a total disappointment."
1,14mbs into a brick wall,"Bought 2 of these last year. Took about 40 photos the other day of various flowers to download for my wife.Put the chip into my laptop card reader and started looking at the pictures and all of a sudden I started getting those little beeps you get when you plug in a new card, etc.. And then, it was gone. Took out an reloaded, nothing. Put back into my camera (Nikon D5000 ) error message, card defective! As with others, not a lot of use on the card, it just died.Ordered new SanDisk cards last night and will be pulling my other transcend cards. Less expensive ? they were but consideringthe results, far too costly."
1,I should have listened to the bad reviews...!,"I bought many of these cards, being a good value, with nice performance & storage for the money. I ignored the bad reviews here and focused on the good ones...Well, one of the cards suddenly died after a few weeks. With hundreds of un-recoverable photos and videos. The card is not recognized on the camera or any computer, so you can't even use a recovery program. I hope I will still be able to find a way and recover all the data.I quickly backed up all the data of the additional cards I have, and will do this very often...BEWARE! Spend the few extra bucks for a SanDisk. It's well worth it!!"
1,Brand new card corruption - not so good for a wedding!!!!,"I'm not sure what the heck happened with the brand spanking new memory cards I used to photograph a wedding, but when you get a message that your card is corrupted, it's not necessarily what you want to see.Luckily I was able to recover the photos, but I am done using Transcend cards."
1,Canon PowerShot SD500 Digital ELPH,"This product shows up on the search as working with Canon PowerShot SD500 Digital ELPH, but I got the following error message: Memory card error .... Card locked!Also, I don't know where to mail this card back for a replacement with one that really works with Canon PowerShot SD500 Digital ELPH."
2,Speed not up to rating,"The class 6 rating must not be for sustained use as my Sandisk Ultra class 4 8GB outperforms this card. When used in my Canon t2i this Transcend card cannot write fast enough and long enough for me to do continuous HD video for more than a few seconds without interruption. This has never been a problem with my Sandisk Ultra class 4. As long as I don't use this Transcend card for video (the reason I bought it) it seems to perform well enough, and it is pretty cheap for the capacity, thus the 2 stars instead of 1."
4,Decent,"For those looking for SD cards for a camera, you should know that the Class ratings are some combination of max/continuous, random/sequential, read/write speeds. But the continuous sequential write speed is basically the only one that matters for use in a DSLR, and for this purpose, Sandisk does better than Transcend. Also, there's no reason not to buy Class 10, which are not much more expensive (if at all) for cards up to about 8GB.I'm using this card in my Canon Rebel XS (the EOS 1000D), which doesn't have very high FPS, and doesn't do video. If you have basically any higher-end DSLR, stick to Sandisk Class 10. I haven't tested it, but I would guess that the ""burst"" modes of even some high end compact cameras (which can hit 10 FPS for short bursts) might stress this card."
5,Great SD Card,The Trancend 4 GB SD card works so great that you simply don't even think about it. Using it in a Canon digital camera and absolutely no issues at all have cropped up with it. What else to say except that the price was great too!
5,Transcend 8GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card Review,Solid product. Used on a Nikon D80 without any problems.I would recommend it to others.
5,Good price and Quick delivery!,"Even christmas holiday season, they delivery was so fast and secure.I like it and want to recommend to my friends."
4,Lots of memory,"I think this memory card may be ever so slightly slower at taking pics than my higher quality 1G card. BUT I may be just imagining it. Regardless, it's a honkin' ton of memory and I never have to worry about running out/switching cards. Since I use my Canon sd870 as a ""photo frame"" half the time, showing pictures that I am too unorganized and/or lazy to get developed in a timely fashion, it works perfectly for me. Lots of room for videos too. I spent less for this 8G card than I did for a 1G card less than a year ago. Whew - such a racket!"
5,Transcend SD card,"I had to trust Amazon to buy this card, but it turned out great. Don't worry about the name, the card works great."
2,misadvertised,This memory card is too large for the DELL Axim PDA. Apparently the PDA will only support a 4g card.
3,Not For All Cameras/Devices,"I purchased this card for my Canon PowerShot SD450, the card isn't recognized in this camera. I plan to give it to a friend with a compatible camera or device.Make sure it's compatible with your device before you purchase this item; it is not the same as a standard SD card. (Maybe this is common knowledge to most, but it wasn't to me.)"
1,Doesn't work in my camera,"Transcend 4 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6This card doesn't work in my camera. I have tried to reformat it and it still doesn't work. Cheap, but why waste your money."
5,Two strikes and out!,"Once burned twice shy saith the wise man: The first Flash Memory Card would not work in either of our cameras---one a point and shoot and the other a Pentax SLR. Neither did the replacement which I did not ask for and had all kinds of grief trying to get a refund. You showed that I didn't pay for the replacement so, even though it was also defective and immediately returned, ""Y'all didn't owe me anything"".Suffice it to say, I do not trust Transcend and believe no one reads instructions............C.T.P"
1,Very Dissatisfied!! EKE Technology,"I bought this Transcend 8 GB Card along with a Canon XSI Camera. This card was recommended as a card to work well with the Canon and was being sold as an add on. I read a review of a guy who it worked well for with this camera. Well when I got it it wouldn't work with any of 3 Canon cameras. It kept giving error messages and also wanted to be formatted. I did format it a number of times with no success. I was asked to rate the Company I purchased the card from ,Eke Technology ,and to email them before I would leave any bad feedback. I emailed them about 4 weeks ago and no answer. So Im forced to report that they seem to be a bad , unreliable company that apparently will not stand behind their products. Now Im stuck with a card that will not work and lost my money."
4,It works,It's a memory card. It works fine. It came free with the camera. What else needs to be said.
5,Great card at a great price,"This SDHC card is one of the best values around. I use them for personal use and for business use and have been using a few for about four months of heavy usage with no problems.CONS:- NonePROS:- Great price per GB for a class 6 card- Class 6 card (high speed) so excellent for camcorders and cameras, storage in laptops/netbooks, etc-Worry free...I've deployed 17 of these for business purposes and have had zero problems to date"
2,Beware - unreadable,"It does its job well. BUT, I was not able to read it in on my computer. You'll have to check to see if your computer can read this device...go to the Transcend site to find out before you buy. It obviously isn't backward compatible. Therefore, 2 stars is generous...got to be able to read what's on there!"
1,"Cheap card, cant handle 1080p or 720p video","Tried using this card for 1080p and 720p video on a Canon Rebel T2i.. couldnt handle it, video was very very choppy and unusable.. go with a brand name card"
3,Transcend 8GB SDHC CARD (SD 2.0 SPD Class 6),"1st one I received didn't work which meant I had to send it back and go buy another card elsewhere for a special event. Otherwise, once I received a new card it seems to be working well."
1,How Did this Get Rated So High?,"The user rating for this item is inaccurate. Those who've rated this card must have no other cards to compare to, this card is horrible. This is one of the slowest SD cards I've used since 2008, it certainly is not a Class 6. The max read speed I'm able to obtain is 4.5 to 5 mbs, which is horrible. I have a 8 gig MicroSD (TS8GUSDHC6) which gets 8 mbs read easy. I will not be buying anymore SD cards from Amazon. I'll stick with their competitor because the user ratings on their site are much more accurate."
2,Misleading representation of what is provided,"The product did function and is misrepresented as having a standard size card 'adapter' that mates the 'mini' card to the larger format. This adapter is not provided and I bought it because of that adapter. It comes with an adapter to mate the mini card to USB, which is not what was pictured."
5,Great value and speedy delivery,Used in my video camera and hold great amount. Don't have to worry about running out of storage.
4,Good buy,I purchased this card recently and so far its been a good buy. Clicked few pictures and saving time was quick. Most important factor being cost and its value for money
3,Cool item,Great item to have...You just have to make sure to print them out off the card...Great gift item for anyone...
4,nice purchase although I am not sure I need such a big memory,"I planned to buy a 4GB but a friend said bigger one is better when you travel. So, although I still have not got a chance to feel how better a 16 GB is, I do not see any shortcomings."
3,NORMAL!!,facil entrega muy responsables a la hora del envio.excelente producto.muy buena calidad.buen precio y seguridad en el estado en que llego el producto
1,Memory card seems to be corrupt.,"Ever since I bought this SD Card, my files have been ""corrupt"" and deleted from my camera randomly. My camera was working fine before this, which leaves me to believe that the problem is the SD card."
5,Very fast & spacious,"While using this card I've had no trouble at all shooting RAW images as fast as I needed. With ample speed and space, this is a good choice for almost any SD flash storage need."
5,Way more than enough,"This card holds more than 1800, 14.2 mp resolution pictures, from my camera or about an hour of video (assuming your battery lasts that long), so it's way more card than I really need so far. At first I was thinking about getting a small USB porter to go with it, but since I really don't need to ever take it out of the camera I just use the mini-USB cable whenever I download pictures. There is no apparent lag, in speed so it's a perfect card so far."
5,Works for me,I bought this card last month to go with my new Panasonic Lumix LX3 camera. So far I have been very pleased.
1,Corrupted after a handful of uses,"Bought this for my Canon Rebel XSI, had no problems at first but after maybe 15 uses, the card corrupted. I thought it was just the one time, and that it was linked to my low battery, and afterwards I retook the pictures that had been lost, and was able to view them and edit them on the camera. Several hours later, however, when I went to offload the pictures onto my computer, the card said it had to be formatted, and that there was nothing on it. Couldn't view any of the pictures on a PC, Mac, PC laptop, Mac laptop, OR the camera anymore. I strongly recommend finding another card, I know I will be."
5,Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card,"I am impressed with this Memory Card, has good speed and seems reliable so far! San Disk and Transcend are the only cards I purchase. San Disk may have an edge on Trascend....but are also slighty more expensive."
2,Does not live up to speed claim,"I bought this card since it is supposed to be a fast write cycle (class 6). It does only marginally better than an el-cheapo generic memory storage card. My videos shot at 720p / 30 fps are blocky - they show a ""jello-like"" artifact where blocks of vertical pixels move up and down causing faultlines to appear vertically before the lagging parts ""catch-up"". Certainly ruins the HD experience. It appears related to the speed of writes. This card is SUPPOSED to handle it. Seriously thinking about returning the card unless I can find how to get the problem fixed."
1,Card is Defective,"When I used Nikon D5000 with this card, some pictures are cropped, and the video image has some blue/red flash, plus can't replay to the end. After I switched to another brand, everything is perfect."
2,Stupid Lock is Too Easily Moved,"Great card except that the ""lock"" switch on the side of the card is moved to the lock position everytime i insert the card into my device. When the lock is on, you cannot record onto the card or delete from it. I had to crazy glue it so I can use the card."
5,Very fast and reliable,"I bought this card for my new Pentax K100D Super D-SLR. It works great, fast and reliable. No problems whatsoever."
1,Cheap and worthless,"I bought this Transcend 16 GB card for use in my Canon PowerShot S5 IS. It seemed to be working well at first, and I had taken well over 500 photos before I realized the card had randomly lost the first 200 or so pictures. They were irretrievable. Highly irritating! Needless to say, I returned it and got a different brand."
5,Thrilled!,I was thrilled to find a 16GB card at the price I paid for an 8GB card only six months ago. It works great and holds all my music which I use in my Creative Zen. I love it!
5,Great add-on for Asus Eee PC,"Just pop it in the slot, you've justmore than doubled your drive space onthe little Asus Eee PC. Great deal!Works with the computer, without hassel."
1,"MINE DIDN""T WORK IN ANY CAMERA","Went on vacation with this faulty chip, only to return home to find I had missed the window to return it. Just happy it was not an expensive item; disappointed consumer."
5,NO PROBLEM,MY CARD ARRIVED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED AND WILL WORK JUST GREAT IN MY NEW CAMERA. I HAVE FOUND THE NEWER CAMERA'S PICTURES TAKE UP MORE SPACE. THE UPSIDE TO THAT IS THAT THEY TAKE BETTER PICTURES! GLAD TO HAVE THE 16GB.
1,Went corrupt after 2 weeks,"I bought this card for my Canon Rebel T1i, because it was cheaper than other brands. Big mistake. It worked fine for about 2 weeks, then the card went corrupt. I didn't lose my old photos, but I couldn't take new ones. New images would show up as broken or only as half an image. I ended up buying a SanDisk 8gb to replace it, and I've had no problems with it. I'll never buy another Transcend card again. They aren't reliable. You're better off investing in a more expensive card that won't fail on you and cause you to spend that much more money."
3,The Fastest Card at This Price But...,"This SDHC card is the fastest one in its price range but it may cause your images to be lost.I use two of this in a Canon SD750. After the first use, all of the images were lost. (But thank God, I could rescue them with Lexar Image Rescue 2, a program better than its competitors) Then I formated the card(s) in the camera(s) with ""low level format"" option several times and there has been no problem after that so far.I can suggest these points to potential owners of this card:1- Use it very carefully, make backups if possible.2- Format it several times before the first use with ""low level format"" option.3- If you loose your images, don't panic. At this situation, It is very important not to take anymore pictures. If you take pictures after this point, you can overwrite your lost images and there can be no chance to get them back. Connect your card to your computer with a card reader (SDHC Compatible) and rescue them with Lexar Image Rescue."
5,Fast and roomy,works well with a 10 MP camera (PowerShot G7) - fits about 900 highest quality JPEGs. No problems shooting continuous video. You are much more likely to run out of battery power than space.
1,Lock failure,"I used the memory card to transfer files between a netbook and other portable computers that have no DVD or other removeable disk drives. After only four or five transfers, the plastic slider for locking the card slipped into the 'LOCKED' position every time it was inserted in a reader slot. I tried removing the slider but the computers continue to see it as 'Locked' no matter what I did. Hoping for better luck with a SanDisk! Looking at the other 1-star reviews, there appear to be about two hundred other people that have run into this same defect."
3,SD Mediocrity,Nice if speed is not important to you. I still use my USB drive more because it writes faster.
5,Terrific! Very well worth the money,Very happy using the 16gb card in my digital camera. Works great. No problems in my two months of heavy use. Would buy Transcend cards again.
5,Performs exactly as expected,Popped this into my camera and it works fine. Operates exactly as described... not much else to say about it! The price was certainly right.
5,works great and is cheap,works great and is cheap. I use this for my kids IXL computers to store all the games. The price was excellent.
5,Durable and reliable,"I've had this card for 2 1/2 years now and used it in my Nikon camera and with a Mac laptop. It hasn't caused any problems for me and seems able to withstand significant abuse. In its plastic case it has bounced around in bags, been in back pant pockets, and a year ago even accidentally been through a complete wash and dry cycle. Still working without a hitch!"
5,"Works great, make sure your computer can read HC cards though!","This is a great card for a good price, how ever make sure your computer can read the card...and don't freak out if it can't. All you have to do is hook your camera up to the computer with a USB cable and put the card in the camera and it'll work.Came at the later end of the shipping prediction, but still on time."
3,Warning: identical cards aren't identical,"Works fine, but...I ordered two cards at the same time, one to serve as a backup for the other. However, the two cards, despite identical markings, packaging, etc., differ by about 50MB in capacity."
5,Good,I had this card for over a year and it's been good so far. I like Kingston a bit better but this card is pretty good too.
2,Lasted 6 months,"I'M not sure what happened to this one, it lasted 6 months then could not be recognized by the camera or the computer."
2,College Student Review,"This is a great chip, besides the fact that 20% of my files kept being corrupted. This resulted in pictures being deleted daily from my study abroad trip. You cannot recover them once they are lost. Very disappointing. Not sure what the solution is."
5,Great SDHC card with rock solid performance at a low cost,"I bought two of these cards to replace 2 that I sent off to a production editor with video of a shoot. The original cards were purchased in 2009 and were used about 100 times I'm guessing with no end in sight. I got these new ones based on the great preformance of the older cards with no other considerations. These cards have been washed and dried (by accdent) in pants pockets and still off loaded video as if nothing happended, multiple times. These Transcends are a staple for dependble video."
1,Hardware failure caused the loss of all wedding photos,"Had the card for about a month before it died. I had other SDHC card that got corrupted and needed to be reformated. I could recover photos stored on the card after reformatting. This time, it looks like a hardware failure instead of software corruption since I can't even format the drive. All data recovery software could not access the card (could not detect the size of the card since it's not formatted). Unfortunately, it died on a day where I attended a wedding so all the photos are gone now. At least Amazon accepted the return without any issues."
4,Card for a camera,"what can one say about a card, it came well packed and on time and is now in my one camera."
5,"Great value, defective part replaced quickly!","Ordered two of these for two cameras (same model). One worked fine, the other was defective, but seller resolved this quickly with a working replacement. All are working fine now."
5,Can't Go Wrong With This,"You can't go wrong with this! Great size, speed, & reiability. Remember this is SDHC so it won't work in just an old SD reader!"
4,Happy with product so far,"I am pleased with the product so far.I have not had it long. I bought it because I have a new HD video and still camera and tend to take a lot of video. Prior to this I was using a 2 gig card.I was not as pleased with Amazon. I ordered the SD card on-line; I had ordered items from Amazon before and already had an account. Amazon took and acknowledged my order, but the order never came and no advisement of any problems via e-mail. When I went on line to track my order it said there was no order? Bottom line my credit card had neen renewed and it had a new expiration date, so when that didn't match with my card on file Amazon just deleted my order. I had to call CS and they were no help at all. I had to go back to Amozon on-line, update my expiration date and place a new order. BUT, they increased the price from my original offer, this all happened over a 3 day period?Shame on you Amazon for these tactics."
4,Bien pero no tanto.,"Funciona perfecto, creo que puede sustituir a cualquiera SD-HC 6, pero no creo que sea mas rápida que una Lexar o una SanDIsk de la linea premium."
2,Transcend 8 GB SDHC Memory Card,I bought this Memory Card for my camera and it doesn't work for my camera like it said it would. I can use the card with my laptop but not the camera. At least I got some use out of the card.
2,Canon PowerShot SD200: this Media did not work,"My older Canon PowerShot SD200 ELPH camera did not recognize this media. Don't understand why. My laptop could read and write to this SD card.The camera reported the card was ""locked"" but it was not locked. I moved the slider to ""Lock"" and the camera reported the same thing. Moved the slider back and forth, same report.The laptop (HP DV8300) reported no problems. The media was formatted as FAT16. I tried reformatting to other types, no change in the camera.Very strange."
2,got burned with this card,"i bought this card for my canon powershot sx210 and i lost most of my data,video taping a concert on shiprock and got it home and it said data corupted,so i lost about one halve of my data,what a bummer,i will not buy this card ever again"
1,25% overall fail raite (100% for me),"If you look at the reviews people either give this 5 stars or 1 star. Sure it averages to 4 stars but this isn't a book or a movie, it's a piece of hardware and averages mean nothing. Be WARNED, if you buy this there is a 1 in 4 chance that your product will fail within a month of buying it. I filled up this card with 16gb of video without problems. Then when it was mounted on my PC it began the dying process. I ended up losing hours of HD video. Initially I had bought two of these cards and the second one died in the same way, though I was able to get the files off first. My Kingston brand SD cards are perfectly fine however. Take my advice, buy another brand that doesn't have a 25% fail rate."
1,Don't trust it for you pics,"Card failed after the fourth time out in the field shooting during a camera write sequence, fortunately I only lost a few shots. I'll stick with San disk or Kingston from now on, cheap does not cut-it when you lose a one take only photo."
4,transend card a winner,this is a great deal and shipping was fast!I use it in my Zen mp3 player;works good.
3,"not bad, works pretty good",I bought this card that we would have more capacity for taking digital pictures while on vacation. You get virtually the full amoung as available storage; as hoped. The upload and download speeds are okay but the the fastest that I have seen. I dont know it it is a hardware or software issue that keeps it from going faster but still an okay card for the money.
4,flash memory card,No failure yet. Transfer rate between takes is acceptable but is hard to tell if it is the card or my camera.
3,Class 2 card advertised as Class 6,"Have a Kingston 16GB Class 4 SDHC card. Average write speed using teracopy is 14.6 MB/s.The Transcend card is rated at Class 6, but the average write speed is 9.6.This is using a Transcend card reader, TS-RDP8K in a USB2.0 port.They say Class 6, but it is more like Class 3.I have two of them, they work fine but they are slow."
4,"It's a good card, man",It's just a flash card. Lots like it. But this brand you can trust. I've had it for a few months and it's doing a-OK.
1,Defective SD Card,"The card has proven to be unreliable & defective. It will no longer upload to my PC or any other device. It indicates ""Memory Card Error"". The camera manual recommends reformatting which deletes the photos. The photos can still be viewed on the camera. The card is beyond the 30 day return for electronics but I am waiting Amazon's reply to my request for a return with proration. Transcend may be a low quality knockoff but many have been sold and apparently used without problems."
1,One use...doesn't work,Unfortunately the reader and the disk that came together do not work. I purchased this disk because I already purchased a 4g disk THAT DID NOT WORK. What a waste of money!!!
5,works as expected,I've had my Transcend 4 GB card for about month. No problems as of yet. I have a database for a dictionary stored on the card and my dictionary still seems to run fast.
4,Great product - check compatibility on camera and USB adapter,"Product is perfect great price, delivery. Please note that MOST of the usb adapters don't do the 8GB chips. Check your camera also for compatibility. Product is perfect"
1,Memory card,I returned this memory card. It was sold as part of a bundle with my camaera and it was the wrong size. The camera required a microSD card.
1,Low end crap!,"Total devastation!! This Memory Card does NOT hold pictures!! I took many pictures over the winter holidays and when I went to down load off this card, everything is BLACK and it says ""problem with memory card""!! I have lost all of my pictures due to this low end piece of crap! If you want your pictures to stay on the memory card, then pay a little more for higher quality!!"
1,H1 Zoom memory card needs and options.,This memory card was a suggested option for the H1 Zoom recorder. It isn't as it will not fit the Zoom H1. The Zoom H1 needs a microSDHC card and not the SDHC (non micro) card as it is too large to fit into the Zoom H1 recorder.
1,never received it,"I never received this item. I took advantage of the free deal with purchase of a Canon Powershot Camera, but did not see the ""add to shopping cart"" in my haste to purchase the camera. That's is my fault. When I received the camera a few days later and noticed the memory card was not in the package, I immediately went online to see my mistake. I then went online and ordered the memory card. When the ""received by"" date had passed, I again went online to track the card. A scan by Fed Ex was shown in West Virginia the day after purchase. I contacted Amazon immediately and they refunded my account the very next day and told me that they didn't have the card in stock, while the site itself showed the card available. Very frustrating! There I was on Christmas morning, unable to use my new camera because I didn't have the memory card."
1,No response to email,"I sent email to BoBoTECHNIC asking about the $4.88 ""shipping charge"" for the Transcend 8Gb Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card and an offer for a free SDHC Card reader (worth $4.99). During Amazon Checkout I noticed the ""shipping charge"" for the two items had doubled to $9.76. I sent an email asking if they really intended to do that considering an SDHC card and a reader would not ""cost"" $9.76 to send.I GOT NO RESPONSE.So I guess that's how the pad their profit. AVOID THIS SELLER. EXCESS SHIPPING CHARGES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE. Non-response to E-mails is also not appropriate for a legitimate business."
4,An Average SD Card,"This card great for the price. You get a good quality card with fair transfer speeds. I don't exactly like the color scheme of the card but if you want a good card for a good price, this card would be a good choice."
3,not for older computers and devices,"I was hoping to download some songs for an older MP3 player discarded by my daughter. I have done this on regular SD cards, but the HC does not work on my 7 year old PC nor my 5 year old MP3 player. The card works fine on my daughter's 2 year old laptop."
5,good,"I haven't used this item yet since I just received the camera, which I order thru Amazon and I am still waiting for the rechargable batteries which were ordered the same time as I ordered the memory card."
1,Amazon Sucks,I bought a new Fuji camera on Nov. 10th from Amazon and this memory card to go with it. I got the camera right away but was informed that they were out of the cards and would ship as soon as possible. I am now informed that I will not get this until after Dec. 25th. I bought this camera to use at Thanksgiving and Christmas and now I have to buy a card elsewhere. I have nothing against the card as I've never gotten it but as a frist time buyer from Amazon I think they stink!
2,Check compatibility before buy,"I wonder why this doesn't work in my laptop (XP), desktop (VISTA) and scanner. I expect it should work atleast with my desktop because, it is one year old and has all latest sp updates. My friend told me that the new memory cards are only compatible with the new card readers not with the old machines.I didn't see any of this information while i bought this item. I returned this item because of this compatibility problem."
1,Not Compatible,"I can't believe the card, I had to find out the hard way it doesn't work with any of my devices and my camera, laptop w/card reader and stand alone card reader are all less than 2 years old and it doesn't work with any of them. The right up implied that it would work with relatively newer devices, but didn't define newer as being something bought in the past 2 months!!!!!! Just a waste of money."
5,SDHC,"I use the card in a Nikon S600 camera. Nikon manual only recommends several brands of cards (Not Transcend) stating other brands may not work in the camera. Card worked fine storing over 200 photos so far. With the camera set at 10MP, highest resolution, the camera shows the card will hold 760 photos. Also, there was no problem using Nikon Transfer to transfer pictures to the PC."
3,Good inexpensive SDHC card,"I used this card with my Nikon D90 - works well. After format, operation is good. The only issue I had was the camera gave me an error message during a photoshoot. To reset the error, I had to turn off the camera and remove the SD card, re-insert, and turn on... then it works again. Have not experience lost of data yet (thank God), but will test whether if it is the card or my camera. I had another SDHC 8GB from Transcend without this issue on the same camera so I am suspecting the issue may be from the new card."
2,Crapped out after a year,"It worked fine for a little less than a year after I bought it, for use with a Panasonic Lumix camera. It worked, nothing too flashy, but then it's a memory card. But about a month ago it started to crap out - first one ""memory read error"" wiping out all the pictures then stored on it. Then it became more regular, and now does not work at all.I mean, I guess I can't get too upset about it crapping out when it only cost $[...] or whatever it was, but still, I'm planning on staying away from Transcend for at least my next memory card."
2,Great while it lasted...,"bought this card and it lasted about a month and a half, just became unreadable all of the sudden, good thing I got most of the pictures off!"
1,worthless,I just bought two of these. Neither works in my camera or either SD reader to which I have access. Every other SD card I've tried works fine on all these devices. I have no idea what the problem is. Don't buy this product.
1,item not usable,"i'm sure i was just unlucky. the item arrived but not usable. the memory card cannot be read with my memory reader and two of my camera. when i returned to seller, they claimed they didnt received and refuse to get me refund/credit. bad seller !!do NOT buy anything from eek technology !!"
4,Good product,"Hasn't broke down on me yet. Had it for awhile now. Forgot the date I purchased the item. Bought it with my canon powershot camera. Works well with it. Though have read up on several digital photography books saying that they wouldn't recommend using a storage card with too much memory because if it breaks down, you'll lose all your stuff on it. At least on Scott Kelby's book, he suggested using several 2GB card instead so if you lose/one breaks down on you, you still another card left with your precious pictures on it."
4,"Excellent card, works great with my Canon Vixia HF S10","I've used this for weeks with myCanon VIXIA HFS10camcorder to record high definition video files (AVCHD format). It works great - and I'm very happy with the price. I bought one card by itself and one with the reader - combined with my onboard memory I should be set for most projects. I really like to use the reader since it leaves my camcorder free - and it's so much handier (for some reason by design the camcorder won't run off batteries when it is downloading files, so you have to plug it in to the wall outlet and also plug it into the computer with a USB 2.0 cable; with the little card reader all I do is pop out the card and plug it into the reader and plug that into the USB outlet). Works great. I'll definitely be buying more of these."
2,Good for the first two weeks.,Mine was good for about the first two months. Then for some reason card stopped working at all. I've worked with these things enough to know how to use them. My 8gb Transcend card fails.
5,Great Product / Great Price,"I've had several Transcend SD cards and had great success with them.This is a class 6 card perfect for on the fly recording devices and at the price offered by Amazon, you can't beat it IMO."
1,Unhappy with warranty service,"I purchased this card in 2007, at the prevailing price which was considerably higher. It stopped working a few months ago. I contacted Transcend USA for warranty replacement. I received a response and RMA number. I complied with the instructions and mailed the memory back to them with the RMA number and address on the outside. About 14 days later I received it back from the post office saying it had been refused by the recipient. The envelope was cut on the short end cleanly, presumably by some sort of a letter opening device. I have contacted Transcend and supplied the information that they requested to investigate, but subsequent emails and phone calls are unanswered. For such an inexpensive item this whole episode seems quite silly. Caveat emptor... Buyer beware."
2,Don't trust this card with anything important!,"The reason I did not give this SD Card a one star rating is because I bought two. The first card has worked fine. No issues. However, the second card failed shortly after I started using it. Unfortunately it failed, after I had just shot some very important and hard to duplicate video. A total disaster!I would suggest, if you are thinking about using this card for anything really important - DON'T!If you have to pay a bit more, I would do so for a higher quality, more dependable SD Card."
2,Card failed! Any help is welcome,"I purchased several Transcend 16GB class 6 SDHC cards to go with a new Canon Camcorder. Firstly this card seems to work fine, is easy to use and the recordings are crisp and clear. However, one card failed for reasons I cannot understand, and has become completely unreadable. Any suggestions on how to recover precious footage will be most appreciated. I am just hoping that there will not be any further failures before I can back up the contents of my other cards! If not for this unfortunate and disappointing mishap, I would have given this product 5 stars. Thanks"
4,LOTS of room for video,"Lots of space on this card, seems like it transfers pretty quickly too. I've been using it a few months, and I've had 2 videos that have had trouble with transferring them off the card. But I'm doing it through the camera, it might work better using a card reader.Overall, this was great bang for the buck."
1,Don't trust This Card,"I bought two of these cards three months ago. One worked (and is working) well and the other appeared to for a couple of days. Then, without warning or any other indication, it is showing an error with my Canon HF200. I pulled the chip out of the camcorder and tried to read it on my PC with no luck. I then took it to Mike's to see if they could recover the video. The tech said his computer couldn't even recognize that the chip was there. He also said that they have heard of a great deal of complaints with this brand."
1,Won't work in my camera,"Be certain your camera is compatible with an ""HC"" memory card before ordering this product. It does not work in my 3 year old, 5 megapixel Minolta."
2,Does not work --- and I am mad,"I stored pictures on the card but my PC would not read them...something about USB 1 error.I am not bothering to return for a refund because of the low price. By the time I get an RMA, wrap the item, pay for the postage --- it is not worth the trouble. I tried to give the rating no stars but wasn't able to.transHope that Amazon will dump this vendor.P.S. I am mad about losing some very good shots."
3,Could be better.,Well the price I paid was great. However for some reason I cannot put the card into the slot on the computer and the images come on the computer. I have to plug my camera to the USB. Which waste battery life. Maybe there is something Im not doing right however its pretty annoying.
5,Works great,"In the camera purchased with this SD card (Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS1 10MP Digital Camera), the SD card and camera are fast and reliable."
4,fast,"this memory is faster then all the other sd and sdhc's that I own, it's about 16mb per second. I have 4 different all in one card readera only 2 of them reads it, make sure you have a newer sdhc card reader, older sd card readers doesn't work with it.Good memory, works great with my sanyo xacti camcorder."
1,very unreliable,"Very unreliable, sent mine back after a week and several corrupt images from different shoots.From every shoot, out of 100 images there would be at least 3 corrupt.Never had a single corrupt image out of thousands with kingston or pny."
1,Should be taken off the market,"Used this card for our first cruise.Memory card error.Tried recovery programs but nothing worked.Phone Transcend where the representative told us that yes, we have problems with the card.Told to send it back for replacement.Why would anyone want another unreliable Transcend card and risk losing priceless vacation pictures?If your product is unstable, should be recalled from the market.I give this a minus five star.JUNK!"
1,"Memory Card ""Crashed""","While using the card on my canon T1i Rebel on vacation, the card had a sudden ""crash"". I was no longer able to use the card on my camera or view the files on my PC. Had lost all pictures."
1,Worked for a couple of months...,"I read all the reviews and thought, ""Well, the majority of them are positive, and I need more memory..."" I was wrong. I have had this memory card for my Canon A1000 IS camera. Not a problem until today, less than 3 months after purchasing it. Took a few pictures and 10 minutes later, the ""memory card error"" message popped up. I thought it was the camera, but I put in a new memory card from a different company and it was fine. Thank goodness I had downloaded the majority of the pictures already. There are a few pictures on there I had taken earlier today that I will try and retrieve somehow.If you get this card, make sure you have the ability to download immediately. Otherwise, I wouldn't take the chance. Money down the drain..."
2,Defective,"I was persuaded to buy two of these SDHC cards by all the positive reviews. The first one was defective. It made my brand new Nikon D90 behave strangely. About 25% of the time when I turned the camera on the ""Format"" screen on the LCD popped up asking if I wanted to format the card. I selected ""No"" and pushed the o.k. button. Unfortunately, this did not get rid of the screen. I had to turn the camera off and on once, twice, or three times to get rid of the screen. It also happened sometimes during a shooting session. At first I thought that I had a defective camera. After using the card for a couple of days and still having the same problem I decided to try the other card. Using this second card solved the problem and it hasn't happened again after several days of using it. I went back and read the negative reviews and decided that the quality control by the manufacturer isn't very good. I'm going to send both of them back and order a couple of Sandisk SDHC cards."
2,Transcend 16GB SDHC is Class 4 Not Class 6,"Storage space on this card is 16GB as advertised, but it is definitely not Class 6 as advertised and priced. This card has a max write speed of 4.2 MB/s with an average of 4.0 MB/s which is a Class 4 SD card, NOT a Class 6. Ripped off.If you need a 16GB but not the speed, then find the cheaper priced version marked as Class 4. If you need the 16GB plus the Class 6 speed, then look elsewhere."
3,Cheap Card,"I have used this card for a few days and it already created corrupted photos twice in my Kodak camera even after formatting.Since the card was so cheap($10) I will keep it as a backup,my Sandisk Ultra II cards have never given me any problems."
1,Transcend memory Card - Lock tab fails - cannot read or write,"The lock tab is too loose. It locks when inserting into slot, rendering it unable to accept data and sometimes unable to read when using some (not all) reading mehanisms interfacing with computer. Unable to format card with H-2 Zoom recorder.Zoom H2 Handy Portable Stereo RecorderZoom H2 Handy Portable Stereo Recorder + 2GB Accessory Kit"
5,Good memory,"good product. But watch out if you have an older card reader, it may not recognize this card. Fortunately the software from my camera let's me download my pics but would have been nice to be able to use my card reader."
5,16GB SD card,The card works great for both videos and for still photos. I bought the class 6 because my Cannon recommended the transfer rate to ensure that it worked with the HD video.
2,The speed is a problem,"I bought this card with my Panasonic camera as an Amazon recommendation and was terrible. The card works OK and is pretty reliable till now, but just for pictures. It is too slow for movies and I can record using it. I just bought another one (Kingston SD) and use this for other things. So, if you need a fast card, this isn't your option"
5,S.G,well Hello there....what can I say great price great product works more fast than 4 class SDHC Cards..I use it in digital frame..buy it..
1,"I waited to use it, and once I did it doesn't work...","Very disappointed in this item, I waited months before opening this SD card and when I finally did it did not work. It's not being recognized by any camera of card reader. Just a piece of junk. If you do decide to buy, open and test immediately..."
4,"Decent Price, Works Great",Just bought another one of these so we would have enough room to video our new baby being born. The price was right and I've never had an issue with performance or reliability with them.
1,Doesn't work!,"Took the memory card out of the packaging and put it in my camera and wouldn't you know.......It didn't work. It wouldn't format and could not be used at all. I wouldn't even register in my computer either. Spend your money on a better company and don't buy this one. If it wasn't for Amazon's great return policy, this would have sucked real bad. Got a Sandisk on the way."
4,4GB SDHC,Decent memory card. It holds files from my Kodak zi8 camcorder as well as saved data from my Nintendo wii. Plus its good for a lifetime! (says the warrenty.)
5,Had no problems,"I have six of these that I rotate around between an audio recorder, DSLR, and video camera (reformatting for each device before use). The first three I ordered 2 years ago and they're still chugging away. I would recommend this product."
5,Transcend 4GB Memory Card,"I am very pleased with the product, the price, and the customer service. I ordered and received a 4GB Transcend memory card, which is working very well for me. The order was delivered on time, however the packaging was excessive. What could have been sent in a padded envelope came in a box that could have held my laptop."
1,Broke after 2 months,"The card worked fine with my digital camera the first two weeks, but one day, it froze. My camera could not write to it anymore; I tried inserting it into my computer to copy all the pictures, but the card kept having a write error and it could not open any of the files. I lost all my pictures and the card is now useless. I did not have time to look into its warranty (if any), so I am pretty disappointed from a reliability and quality point of view."
1,Junk. Doesn't work!,Don't by this. I plugged it into my computer right out of the box and got a memory error. Total junk. Don't waste your time with the manufacturer support. It's worthless. It's going in the garbage. Never again Transcend!
1,Never Worked,"Originally I bought this for my GPS, but the GPS refused to recognize it. Tried formatting it using different softwares but never got it working. Tried it on a few laptops equipped with HDSD readers, but to no avail.I would not recommend this memory to anyone."
5,Excellent Quality & Excellent Price,"I bought several 4 G and 8 G Transcend SDHC cards from Amazon. I took them on a trip to Africa and they were reliable (format before using in camera!) and FAST too. Compare to the same products from other manufacturers (check the specs on the package) and also the prices in stores. The quality is top-notch and you can't beat the price, not to mention no 6% or more sales tax, and no shipping. I've just ordered a 16G (the 32G will be next!)."
1,What an idiot I was,"After buying the card, i was really happy using it. First, after 1 month one day I had an unreadable image in my card, but did not realize the danger at that time.Then 2 weeks ago, all the images in the card suddenly become unreadable. I had almost 150 pictures that weren't uploaded yet, constituting every picture I took this month.I paid 1100$ for the camera. Than for ""saving"" money i used my mind and get this cheap card with good reviews. Than, i lost all the pictures i took in 1 month. After spending 1100$ on a camera, now all my images for 30 days of my life, including very important ones, are lost. Comparing the amount i spend on taking a picture, with the amount i spend for storing it, now i understand how clever I am."
1,Protect your photos - choose a different card,"I bought this 16GB card in hopes of storing lots of my newborn baby pictures. I used it only for a couple of months and when I tried reviewing my pictures on the camera today, I got a ""CARD ERROR"" message on my camera display. No big deal, I thought, my computer will surely open those. But it did not. I got ""FILE CORRUPTED"" message each time I tried to open the contents of the card. Instead of preserving lots of photos, I lost lots of photos. Those last two months of our firstborn baby's life - gone forever. This has never happened with any of my cards before. Save yourself a major disappointment and choose a different brand and a different memory card."
2,Card readers will not recognize it...,"I use my camera for work and we have several uploading stations throughout my office. I tried the card on four different card readers and none of the readers recognized the card automatically, and when I attempted to manually run the drives, the computer crashed repeatedly. Pics are still stored on the card, and work fine via direct USB download from the camera, but it's much easier to just load the card into the readers than to carry around the USB cable all the time."
1,Quit working after 5 hours of Video,This card worked for about 5 hours of video and then it would not be read by the camera or computer. I even ran a check on it using some recovery software and it came up with all bad sectors.We lost about 1 hour of video and missed one of my girls performances because it would not work. I am sending it back and will be buying a Lexar or SanDisk.
1,"Great price, but buyer beware.","After about two months of using this card with no problems, it suddenly stopped working. It is no longer recognized by my camera or my computer (so data recovery programs are useless). I lost about 150 pictures. Transcend could not do anything but refer me to a third-party data recovery company if I wanted to retrieve the pictures."
4,Transcend 16GB SDHC media,"I bought this media to go along with my recently purchased Nikon D5000. I went for this particular brand purely for the price which is much more affordable than ones from other known brands like SanDisk. However, the Transcend brand is known to develop issues over repeated usage and requires good maintenance and is suitable for users familiar with flash media storage."
1,Data gets corrupted,"I got 16 gb version of Transcend SDHC card class 10. I have tried formatting multiple times and with different operating systems, but the data on this card keep corrupting.Amazon.com customer service service is great, RMA is out and no hassle return."
3,lost data,"I was trying to save a few bucks in this purchase, but I may have ""shot myself in the foot"". I viewed all photo and video fine through the camera but when put the feed into a TV (USB input), photos began to corrupt. When downloading photos and video to my PC (Windows 7) some of the pictures are now showing that they are not accessible. This was the first time I used this camera. I have no idea if the corrupt files are the fault of the Transcend card of something the camera did in reading the files."
2,Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6,"I bought this in June 2009 for my wife's camera. It was OK for about 6 months, than crushed once. We lost a lot of pictures and movies of our family. I was able to reformat card and it work for another 2-3 months until it died completely. These time no luck, we lost all of our pictures that we had on this card. I'm very disappointed with reliability of this product."
2,size does matter,great card works well but why do companies insist on jippin us when it comes to size?I ordered the 16 gb and in turn I get a card which the max size is 14.7 that is over a gb missing. I would be find with even 15.7 but being over a gb come on people that is a joke
3,"OK, but crapped out","Product was good, cheap price for the amount of storage. Crapped out after only about a year of use. These things happen with flash memory but will probably go with a better brand next time."
5,Great card,"Been using it for about 4 months now and no problems (not on a regular basis - use it about once a month, but when I first got it, I used it a lot for 3 days straight). Speed seems great (though honestly this is my first SD card, so I can't compare."
5,Great SD card for little price!,This SDHC card is good quality for a great price. I got the 8 GB card and it could take over 1200 14 megapixel photos and over 1 hour of HD quality video. STRONGLY recomend.
2,Unreliable,"I have bought several of these 8Gb and 16Gb cards in the last 2 years and althgough they are fast and highly compatible, I already lost half of the 16Gb batch (3 actually). They simply died in the middle of a transfer operation, never to recover. I know that flash memory cards are usually not the best media when it comes to reliability, but one of these failed me in less than a week. Never got any problems with the 8Gb versions (I have 4 of those). My advise: use them only as transfer media (go for the class 10 instead, it is well worth the few extra bucks) and never, never for backup purposes. And don't dispose of the original files until you have them safely stored on a reliable media."
5,Excellent memory cards,Have been using Transcend SDHC cards for years with never a problem. Good price and work great for general photography.
5,camera card,"great service, price and delivery - cant judge the last two just yet but feel confident they will be exceptional as well."
5,Works well for me,"Works fine with my Canon DSLR, acceptable speed for multi-shoot without slowing down camera operation, big memory capacity, fast download speed to computer; best of all, the price is right."
4,"Plenty of space, small price","This card worked without issue in both my Amazon Kindle and my Canon SD850 IS.Formatted space comes out to 7.5GB on both devices.Speed seems fine. It would be nice if this one came with the USB reader like the 16GB one, but both devices I use it with don't require it."
5,Good memory card,This card holds tons of images. I haven't had any problems with it at all. I would recommend!
5,"Really, really good!","Got this with my girlfriends digital camera. She can take about (without exaggeration) 3,000 full quality, raw, 12MP photos on the same card.That'll last her a while! Muhahahahaha!!"
5,Excellent,"This was used for an overseas trip, under harsh conditions, with humidity, rain and heat. I was wondering how it would hold up, and it just worked great. Can't think of a single complaint."
3,Unreliable Lock Tab?,"I have several of these and am happy with the performance, but the lock slider tab inexplicably came off one of them a few days ago. I don't know how it happened--one day it just wasn't there and the chip was write-protected with nothing of special interest on it. Useless to me now since I can't save anything new to it. I don't have experience with any other brand, so I don't know if this is a common problem with flash memory cards in general. I probably used it five times, so it would have been taken in or out of my camera or laptop a total of twenty times. That doesn't sound like an unreasonable amount of use."
4,Worth every penny,I bought this card as it was the cheapest class 6 SDHC card at the time and I am very happy with it. It seems to work very well although I think it could save the files just a bit faster. I use it with my mac and there are no issues.
4,Camera hobbyst,"I have other brand (class 6)failed on the first time when I used it on HD video recording, and I downgraded its usage for photograph only. This one has successfully recorded both HD video and photograph on 2 events."
1,Card Failed,"Received this item loose but in a typical plastic clam shell. Since it was not manufacutre sealed I have no way of knowing if this was simply re-pacakged. I used card on my H4n Zoom and it recorded sound just fine. However, I also used the card on my Canon Vixia HS10 and as well as on a Canon T2i with deterimental results. There was no indication that the card was not recording but when replaying video, somehow the recodrings came back corrupted. It seems like the card was not fast enough to capture HD footage, but this is just speculation.The footage was important, and therefore I was upset to notice it unrecoverable. Not happy with card or purchase and will most likely throw it away.Sad part is, it wasn't that much cheaper than buying from a physical store..."
2,Didn't make it for half a year,"I got the card quickly. It worked perfectly. I was using it in my Panasonic AG HMC 150. I recorded video without a problem. Until one day, six months later, it just stopped working. I tried to reformat it. It couldn't format any larger than 512 KB?! I contacted Transcend they sent me a key for a program that they said would cure my problem. However the program was a recovery program, it still didn't fix my card. It did have a format tool, which turned out only opened Vista's built-in formatting program, nothing i haven't seen before. When I told them it didn't solve my problem they stopped responding.I asked if I could mail them my card for repair/replacement. No response.I never abused the card in anyway.With nothing to do (besides never buy from transcend again), I formatted the card, although only to 512 KB.Now my computer doesn't recognize it.The card is nice if you have a wobbly chair, I guess."
5,Great Value.,Purchased about 20 of these for some small video cameras. They worked well and the price was good.
5,So far so good!,Taken hundreds of shots on my Panasonic point-and-shoot without any issues. Would highly recommend.
2,Transcend 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6,"I ordered this for my Kodak digital camera. The thing I didn't know is that this will not work in my camera. Why? Because not all cameras, including mine, will accept and recognize a 4GB card. So, before ordering your card, ensure that your camera will accept the size GB card that you order!"
1,Don't expect the seller to ship you the product! STAY AWAY,The seller does not ship within the two business days as stated. They do not ship or give tracking number and to top it off they do not respond to emails. Buy at your own risk!!
1,You put sacred trust into the manufacturer of your flash media... and Transcend failed me.,"I really enjoyed my 16GB SD-HC card, however the 5th time I used it some 4 months after purchasing it, while the card was stored in the best possible conditions, it became completely unreadable. I could no longer read a filesystem, format the card in camera, or use any recovery tools because the card actually, seriously died on me with 15GB of irreplaceable party pictures. I know that these kinds of failures are likely incredibly rare, as I have heard so little about failing flash cards... but to experience the frustration caused by trusting Transcend with a crucial necessity. I need to wait for a replacement card now that it is a warranty issue, and no longer purchase a transcend product thinking I could count on it."
4,Works great although a bit slow,This SD card works great for the price although it is a bit slow compared to other more name brand (and also more expensive) cards. I can still record video onto this card perfectly fine though with my digital camera and would not hesitate to buy this one again.
1,worked for two months....then ERROR city.,"This memory card worked well for two months.....fast speeds and was reliable. then one day i turned on my camera only to see Error with memory card message. would not allow me to reformat (the option was greyed out). thought it might be the camera itself, but tried the card in my other camera and got the same results. the card is NOT locked. could not even view the contents on the card via camera.contacted Transcend and have yet to hear a reply to my email/problem. very disappointed in this product and their customer service (non existent). would return this to amazon but am out of the 30 day return policy.never buying one of these from transcend again, i suggest you avoid this brand and go with something more reliable.$40 down the drain."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I have been an Amazon.com customer for many years and this is the first review I've ever submitted. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I have been planning an Alaska trip for 3 years, even bought a new Canon SX110IS (GREAT camera by the way) for the event. I purchased 2 of the Transcend 4GB SDHC cards from Amazon.com at just under $8 each. I definitely got what I paid for. On the second day of the trip I noticed that several of my picture files were ""unreadable"" on the camera. The next day I lost several more. I ended up going to a Best Buy in Billings, Montana to buy a 4GB Sandisk SDHC card for $32, and it has worked beautifully. So whoever buys these Transcend cards and thinks they're getting such a great deal may want to think again."
1,Error messages from day 1,"From the first day I started using this memory card, I have had problems with it. In the first week or two I had to format the card with my camera (Canon EOS Rebel XS) or remove and re-insert it in order to take pictures. Then I started getting error message that told me images could not be read, memory card is not recognized, insert a new card to shoot... and finally it got so bad that I could not format the card at all with my camera or on a computer, making it impossible to review or download images or shoot new ones. Luckily I didn't have anything important on the card. I don't recommend this product. I recently bought a SanDisc Extreme III, which works just fine."
5,Transcend 8GB SDHC CARD (SD 2.0 SPD Class 6),Transcend 8GB SDHC CARD (SD 2.0 SPD Class 6) Love it - don't have to worry about running out of space (I use it for my amazonKindle)
5,works perfectly,"Bought it together with a camera, and so far no problems. Must say, with a general product like this also did not expect them."
4,more than enough,"4GB for a 10mp point and shoot camera is WAY more than enough. even shooting at highest resolution, it allows well over 500 pictures which is plenty for a couple days on a trip."
1,Never got here,"While they charged by credit card, it never arrived. I've canceled the charge, thank goodness I used Amex.I would buy from them."
5,"Nice Card, Nice Price, Great Packaging","I bought two of these to use in my Canon XSi and I ordered both of them with Amazon's frustration-free packaging, which is a wonderful idea. I thought the price was reasonable even though they were more expensive with the new packaging, and they both seem to be good cards. Both worked upon arrival and I formatted and used both without a problem. I was hesitant at first to purchase them because I didn't recognize the brand. I have always purchased memory cards from Kingston and SanDisk. These seem to be fine and they were cheaper than the other brands."
1,Don't use with Nikon cameras!,"I got this card with my Nikon L100 and it gave me the ""this card cannot be used error"" I tried to format the card but the camera locks up. I tried to format it on my computer but it still gave me the same error. Im sure this card works great with other devices. I'm able to write files to it at amazing speeds, but just not with my L100."
2,"""WAS:"" great deal for the money",I have no problem with it but it was a bit over $14.00. Now that they have raised the price to $18.00 not quite as a good deal but stil good since I have had no problems with it.
5,GREAT!.,All i can say about this card is great. i bought 3 already and use them with my nikon and canon cameras. and i need one more lol.
3,not enough info...,"I bought this for my sony dcs-300. Ooops, doesn't fit. So I sold it to a friend, for a profit, and bought a sony card, now everything is fine..."
2,Not so lucky,"Well, based on the almost 3000 Amazon reviews, I went out on a limb and spent the few bucks to get this card. Unfortunately, I wasn't one of the lucky ones without issues. The card seemed to work ok at first, but after a couple of uses in my camera, it suddenly stopped being read. The camera showed an error that the card couldn't be used, so I pulled it out and put it directly into my PC's card reader only to see another error message that the card was invalid and needed formatting. I eventually got my vacation pics off of it, but I don't think I'm taking any more chances on this card again. Luckily, it was cheap enough to just toss. I won't bother returning it, because I now do not trust this brand and don't want another clunker. I'll go for ones I have had success with before - SanDisk or Kingston. Good luck, but buyer beware. You get what you pay for."
4,Transcend 4 GB SDHC,Very Nice. They were a Christmas gift and used in a new camera and picture frame. All 3 working real nice. Best price for what we were seeing online and in stores.
1,CAUTION: These SD cards die after two months.,"I bought two of these cards to load video files. After two months, the first card started to give file system errors. Since I was using them on Ubuntu, I fsck'd the file system which took care of the problem for the time. But afterwords, same errors continued to pop up. The second card also did exactly what the first one reported. Bottom line, I believe these cards have a very low reliability score and are subject to ""infant mortality"", as called in the electronics industry. I will try SanDisk and see if the same happens. See my upcoming review, and be cautioned with this info."
5,great product,"My memory cards came in the time they were supposed to...which was a fairly short time, and they work great. I couldn't be happier. I got an outstanding price on them and I would most definitely purchase from this vendor again. THANKS!"
4,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,BOUGHT THIS CARD FOR A DIGITAL CAMERA BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP ($4). IT WORKS GREAT AND READS FAST. I USUALLY BUY SANDISK BUT THIS WORKS. TRY IT FOR YOURSELF AND SEE.
1,Card Failed After 10 Months,"Like many (apparently many many) others my 16GB Transcend SD card failed. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones that got at least 10 months of trouble free use in my video cam. I'm moving back to San Disk. I've never had one of those fail. You save 20 bucks by buying this card, but the savings is not worth taking the risk of losing important videos or stills."
1,"Great, until it failed!","This 16 gig SDHC card worked flawlessly for about a year. Suddenly, it failed. I downloaded special software to save the pics (over 1,500). After saving the photos, I was unable to reformat the card so I could use it again. Tried camera, two different PCs, Windows formatting, special SD card formatting software, FAT 32, exFAT -- nothing worked. It did it's job for a year, but now it's useless."
3,Transend memory SDHC,"A lot of people have had issues and so have I. It seems to record and transfer fine. Once you ""cut"" a file from the card it starts getting error and the only way to corret is to format it. I have just made it a habbit to record my video, transfer to the PC then format the card. That seems to have resolved my issues. Other than that issue the card is fast enough for full HD, works for what I need!"
4,Cheap and huge,"Not the fastest card you can buy, but I've found Transcend cards to be cheap and reliable, which is all I need right now."
5,Performs well as expected,Purchased to be both a card reader for our camera and as a thumb drive. Does it's job.
1,Low Quality - You get what you pay for with these,"I ordered two of these for a new GPS unit I purchased. To my surprise and dismay, one of the two was DOA. I have dozens of Flash cards used for enumerable purposes. This is the first time I have had a bad one. I was a bit concerned about how inexpensive these were. At this price, it's hardly worth my time to go and package and ship it back, I'll probably just eat the 17 dollars. Live and learn..."
5,GOOD~,"Do you see that? ""Class 6"" ! I think it can transmit data, pics much faster than some older ""Class"" I bought this for using in my Canon PowerShot SD1100IS (that is also named IXUS 80IS). It works excellent so far. Fast transmission is its highlight as I think."
5,best bang for your buck,"this card is not only ample for my 10 MP camera, but is so fast that i am taking faster shots- response time to record the image is 2 photos per second on my canon powershot sx10is. Also can record 30FPS video withaudio at 720P resolution without lag time or stuttering. don't buy anything less than this hew speed card, this one is rated as ""6"" whereas the $40 sandisk ultra is raated ""4"" but is slower. you will definitely notice a difference in recording speed and therefore speed up your camera. its also good for about 1.5 hours video at 720P!"
1,High Priced Shipping,I ordered this item along with a camera with two day shipping. The camera shipping was $11.97 and the shipping on the SD card was $25.66. So a card priced at $18.93 would have cost $44.59.
1,"Card did not work, difficult to return.",I was also concerned with the quality of this card. After waiting over a month for my high def camera to arrive I found the card did not work. Amazon's policy makes it difficult to return after the return for expires(4 weeks?). Other cards may work fine but check them out fast to avoid wasting your mony as I did. I will find some where ele to buy memeory with a more friendly return polocy for non working items.
4,Does it's job,"I haven't noticed any faster transfer speeds with this ""high speed"" card. It does it's job thou and I'm happy with that."
1,Failed after a week,"Never purchased a transcend product before, and I won't again. After a week of use, during a family gathering, the card started displaying an error when inserted in the camera. Luckily, we had a spare memory card to use. The card also became unreadable in the SD slot on my computer.I'll stick with the brands I'm used to. It's worth the negligible price increase to get reliability."
1,DO NOT BUY! - Company does not stand behind product,"When this card stopped working after a few weeks of being in my camera I was not not surprised, because these things are cheaply made and a certain percentage fail. I went through the process of getting a refund authorization code and mailed it in fully expecting Transcend to replace the card. I was stunned when I got the card back with a form letter saying I had done one of a list of things which absolved them of replacing their defective product (I didn't). The letter also had a series of check boxes which seemed to indicated the product I had sent in was counterfeit. I sent them a protest letter asking them to do the right thing, but they didn't respond. I bought a Sandisk card. Please do the same and avoid dealing with a company that refuses to replace its defective prodcuts."
1,Paid for something I didn't order.,"Two days after my camcorder, memory card and bag. I got this sent to me and they charged me for it. I didn't order it but paid for it anyway. I got two memory cards now and a lighter wallet."
1,Never received,I have never received this item since I bought it a month ago. The seller just deceives the buyer. It is very frustrating when you are cheated by the seller.
1,Will Never Purchase Again,I purchased 3 cards from HDMIKing. None of them worked in my Canon HF10. I doubt the 3 cards I got were actually Class 6. One showed up as Class 3. I have another Transcend card I purchased a year ago from another store that does work in my Canon HF10. Looks like I got a bad batch. I have since purchased a Sandisk Extreme III SDHC card from Adorama and it works perfectly fine. I'll stick with Sandisk in the future.
1,Dead under a year,The card was good while it lasted but I expected a life cycle of greater than 1 year.
1,Dided after 1 month,This card died after 1 month of useing. What is sad is that 16Gb of memories are gone now too. I see many glowing reviews here and maybe I not lucky or something but memories are gone now.
1,DOA,"This item was dead on arrival. I tried it in several devices and all devices returned a ""Locked"" message, like the switch was in the locked position. Situations like this make me appreciate Amazon's return policy. I replaced it with a Kingston card and that has worked well."
2,8gb memory card,Card was malfunctional from the beginning. I bought a new camera at the same time and thought the problem was the camera and so returned it onlt to realize that it was the card when I got a new camera replacement
5,Good SDHC card,"Holds 1300 pics from my 10mp camera. Class 6 so its plenty fast. See little or no difference from a class 4 I have, but this cost the same.Only problem Ihad was the camera came about 4 days BEFORE the card. So I had a new camera, and no card for it.. One of the little things I missed in the travel brochure."
2,I know why they are cheap....,"These cards are a little bit slower and sometimes corrupt my files. There is a brand that I get at Target that I have been very happy with- Lexar Platinum II, class 6. I was hoping that these would be comparable, but they were not. The Lexars perform much better."
1,Doesn't work,"Now, I might be wrong... but if a 4GB card gets me 17:29 minutes of HD video, I should expect about 4 times that ammount with a 16GB card. That equates to about somewhere around 70 minutes. Why am I only getting 18:59 minutes out of it? It says there is 14.9 GB there and available when I plug it in to my computer. It isn't the camera, trust me."
1,Data corruption on about 5% of files,"While using this card with a Sigma DP2S, about 5% of my Raw files could not be read in Lightroom. This happened with both cards. Did not have this issue with a Sandisk card in the camera... so could be a specific compatibility issue between that camera and the card, but still, it caused me to lose a number of photos."
5,"I've bought a few these,....","I've bought a number of these Transcend memory cards in a variety of GB sizes. I have yet to experience any issues, problems, or failures with any of them. I have used them to take pictures with my Sony Alpha DSLR camera and they have worked just as advertised. I have also used them to take video with my Canon HD video camera with no problems whatsoever. I have been very pleased with their price and performance, and would recommend them."
3,Questionable function with no need,"I purchased this device as an SD card for my wife's cell phone (LG-USB40). I was under the impression that this SD Flash card would fit into this cell phone but as it turns out, this SD card is much too big in size. I have no way to test this SD card and have not used it at all. Is it still possible for me to return it or do I need to try and resell it myself?"
2,Free w my wife's camera,I used on my Canon 60d for photos are fine but 1080p video it randomly stops recording which is pretty annoying when your trying to capture the moment.
1,It's not a good product.,I ordered this SD card last December but I did not use it until a month ago. I used it for a dashboard camera for cars. The SD card was dead when storage was fully used. It can't be read or detected by computer or dashboard camera anymore so I have no way to re-format it. My dashboard camera works with other SD cards without any problem. Now this SD card is a trash to me.
5,Love it!,This memory card has tons of storage and has worked flawlessly in my Panasonic digital camera. I recommend this item.
5,Works great in Canon T2i,I purchased this memory from Amazon for my Canon T2i camera. So far it works great for working in HD video mode.
4,Nice Card - Great Packaging,This cards works great so far. Just wanted to say that the frustration free packaging is awesome. No more cutting hard plastic cover with brute force :) Thank you guys!
1,Unreliable,"I lost 16GB of priceless footage and photos on my current trip - the card does not mount anymore, and any card recovery tools I have tried so far are not working. Transcend offers no tools to recover, either. Very disappointing. You get what you pay for."
1,my vacations lost,"i bought two of those item for my canon HD videocamera. i went to SF and captured some moments with my daughter and wife at union square, chinatown, golden gate, etc. Without even taking the memory out of the camera, it said ""please insert a memory card"". i changed with the other memory card and it had no problem, so the camera was right and the card was the wrong thing. now, even if i have 99 good cards, the one with my memories is broken and it deserves 1 star."
1,Card error...all pictures lost!,"This card seemed great for awhile. But after taking many pictures of my son's first t-ball game, I suddenly got a ""Card Error"" message. My only choice was to re-format the card, thus losing all of the pictures. :( After the same thing happened the next two times in a row, I gave up and went a bought a new card from Best Buy. No problems so far with that one. Of course I am past the return window on this one, so I guess I'm out of luck like the rest of the 1-star people on here. The saddest part of course is that the pictures are permanently lost."
1,SD Card,I purchased this card and cant get it formatted to anything Its a dud wishing I could get my money back
3,Let me caution You...,"I am writing to caution any one purchasing this product. This 8Gb SD card works fine, BUT I did not realize that SD cards vary in price based on how much memory you want and how fast they write (writing speed). In other words this card works, but I am using a 12 mega-pixel camera and when I take a picture I have to constantly wait for the image to write to this SD card because it is one of the slower ones on the market. DO YOUR RESEARCH, you don't want to have to deal with data downloading while trying to capture consecutive shots. Like I said it works fine, but it's slower and that's why it seems so ""nicely"" priced for 8GB."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! IT IS A NOT A TRANSCEND PRODUCT!,"Do not buy this product. I want to give it zero stars. I used it in my new camera, successfully took a couple dozen vacation pictures, then had it go black with ""Memory Card Error"" showing on the screen. After lengthly communications with Transcend, and sending the card to them, the card was returned with the message ""Non-Transcend Part"". All attempts to recover the pictures have failed. Transcend was very helpful, but could do nothing with a card they did not make. This card is inexpensive for a reason! Beware! I eventually did receive a refund the seller and $3 from Amazon."
1,Trash!!!!!,"After 1 week of using, the card burnt! after contacting the store they told me that i should only use san disk or kingston!"
3,Space Vs. Speed,"I've taken approx. 2,000 pictures with this card on a Canon SD800 and a Canon SD940 IS. If speed is your need, do not buy this card. It is extremely slow. Instead look at a Sandisk Extreme III. The 8GB version cost as much as the Transcend 16GB. There is a reason for that. SPEED. Other than being very slow, there have been no issues and card works perfectly. This would make a good card for video capturing, but for photography, you are going to miss a lot of shots using this card. Expect a several second delay between photos because it takes so long to write you last image to the card's memory. See my review for the Sandisk Extreme III card for a further explanation of why speed is important."
1,Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6,Bought two of these to take on our trip to Greece. Both got corrupted after 900 pictures or so. Before the trip both cards were formatted in camera (Rebel XTI) to ensure compatibility. I quickly replaced them with a Kingston of same speed and size and no corruption occurred so the camera was not the problem. Fortunately I was able to recover about 90% of the images using recovery softwares (costs $$$$ too) but the remaining of the trip was not as enjoyable because I was worried that the pictures were irrecoverable. I don't recommend these cards whatsoever. I'll return these cards if I could. Buyers beware!!!
1,Failed after a few uses,"I bought this card for my Panasonic ZS3. It worked a few times, but now it only gives me a write error. I've tried to format on several cameras and computers and it won't format. Worthless."
5,Lived up to all the rave reviews....a work horse for the price and class its in,"Works as advertised.....lives up to all the other technical and user reviews which give it 4 to 5 stars. Fast, reliable, and so on. I am very happy with this memory card."
4,Holds lots of photos,Holds lots of photos. I tried putting movies on it and it works but I don't know the length of time it will hold. Maybe with the holidays coming up I can find out what it will hold.
1,"I bought FlshMemory Card for my daughter, but it didn't work!!!","I've bought this memory card for my daugther to use with her Canon Digital camera for her 10-day France Trip in Summer 2010.She took more than 600 pictures with this memory card during her trip. Sadly...all the pictures are unreadable! She's contacting with Transcend to find a solution for this costly error, but no response.She has enjoyed her France Trip, but no memory because this flsh memory card was unreadable. It seemed like this product was Dead-On-Arrival (DOA). She was very sad and upset!!!DO NOT buy this junk...You will regret.Tony"
5,SDHC Fast & Fab,"Great Product!!!!SDHC Device only, will not read or write with most built in SD slots.Product works great on HD Video. Stick with 16 GB or 8 GB as back-up."
1,I returned the item over two weeks ago. And the selller claims to have not received it.,The memory card was not compatible with my camara. I returned the memory card over two weeks ago to erecive a refund. The seller claims that they have not receivedthe item. I will not be buying from them again s I have not been refunded.
2,"Service good, Product bad","The 4 gb SD card does not work good I can not get the pictures off of it.My computer does not read the card, can not format it.I tried other PCs with no success. Now I am having trouble returning the card."
5,Fast shipping Fast card,"I just purchased a vixia HF-S10 Camcorder for a vacation. It is a flash memory based unit. I wanted extra memory for 10 days, so I got Trancend 16 GB card from Amazon. It works purfect. I also tried to save some momey and got a 2nd card from ebay. It came straight from China. It was labeled class 6 but my camcorder saw it as a class 4 with error. 3 weeks later I am still waiting for another card."
1,1 out of 3 cards failed within the first hour of use,"I bought 3 Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC cards along with the Canon AVCHD HF100 flash-based HD camcorder. 1 card exhibited a buffer overrun error in the camera within the first hour of video. Then the camcorder wouldn't even read the card or the videos already on it. Luckily, I was able to recover the videos using data recovery software. Incidentally, the other 2 identical Transcend cards I have didn't seem to have the issue, but a 33% failure rate is bad news. I'm staying away from Transcend from now on."
4,"So far, so good","Using this in an ASUS EEEPC. Some negative reviews of Transcend products out there, but so far these have been working fine for me.Love the ""Frustration Free"" packaging option!"
1,Dont take the risk,"We purchased this as a gift and it did not work, Amazon says they will refund 50-80%. Frustration free packaging means units that have already been opened and returned by others. First time Amazon has ripped me off but we have already started ordering everything elsewhere. Amazon made 20 or so bucks but will lose thousands a year in sales. If you purchase this card test it within 30 days as someone else is going to get my busted card just as someone else before me had this one. Never had a problem with SanDisk and will always pay the extra for the real thing. Bye Bye Transcend AND Amazon."
4,Does what its supposed to do,"Originally they sent the wrong one, but responded quickly, sent the correct one and even refunded my return shipping cost. Bravo!"
4,16GB SDHC memory card,"Memory card just plain works. Being used in a Canon flash-based HD camcorder, it provides 2+ hours of recording time on highest quality setting. Transfer speeds to my PC are as expected. Delivery from Amazon was pretty quick."
4,Doorway to Doom was pretty decent,It wasn't that bad but their was to many people I could hardly keep track of who was who!
4,What happen to the Strange Matter book series?,"Alright,I thought Doorway to Doom was a pretty good book,but why hasn't their been anymore Strange Matter books?I loved these books.If anyone knows why they quit making these great books, please E-mail me at,garhudson@aol.com"
4,not bad,"It was good. But not very scary. Well, thats my opinion. Books don,t scare me. But this book and the series of strange matter is I think very interesting."
5,yeah!,"If you are a fan of southern rock and/or blues, this is an excellent album. The Marshall Tucker band never disappoints! Good variety of songs, all great listening."
1,Cut and cut and cut!!!,"Warning!!! This is not an uncut version of the movie!!! The most interesting bits (if you see what I mean...) are missing from the original German version (""Six Schwedinnen von der Tankstelle""). The German version provides some nice close ups that are not on this DVD and most of the hot scenes are way shorter than expected. I can only recommend you to avoid buying it. Save your money!!!"
1,This Film Fails The 'Test'...,"Another hacked-to-pieces, grind-enamel-off-your-teeth-while-your-intelligence-is-insulted flick reintroduced to an unsuspecting market to cash in on the notariety of Brigitte Lahaie. ALL the good scenes are devastatingly edited, apparantly with a chain saw, leaving us with an incoherent, mindless mess that makes late-nite Skinemax flix look like Stanley Kubrick's catalog. This would be a wretched film even with the good parts left alone, and at the price point asked for on Amazon (or anywhere else), it's akin to outright robbery or a cavity search. Avoid this at all costs, and if someone wants to give you it for free, you'd STILL be better off without it. Even 'High', these 'Girls' failed the 'Test'."
5,A Succint Explanation for the Nature of International Politics,"I am reading Professor Joseph Nye's Understanding Internaitonal Conflicts and it is a fascinating book.First of all, I like its succintness and clarity. Second, I beleive this book is well-balanced in presenting history and theory of international politics. I am sure that anyone who wants to know more about the dynamics of international conflicts can get a huge benefit by reading this book."
4,Very good,"This book helped with my International class so much, has alot information to use on different topics."
3,"Affordable, but not that user friendly","The pros: Affordable, lightweight, simple instructions, heats bottles fast. The cons: Does not fit all size bottles (Avent 9 oz), you have to watch it (no on/off switch or timers), must remember to empty out water each time or water rusts inside."
3,"Good, but . . .","This bottle warmer works great! It is very fast and warms up breast milk with very little effort. However, it does not work with all other bottles. I was disappointed when I bought 9oz. Avent bottles and they did not fit. The box says that it works with all bottles, even wide-mouth bottles, that is not true."
2,Will this bottle ever heat???,I bought this warmer after using it at a friends house with great results. This is a great warmer if you are using tap water and powder formula. If you are using ready to feed or stored breast milk the warmer takes 10+ minutes to warm the bottle. I think I will return it and stick with my method of heating tap water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in the cup of water.
2,Not Very Safe,"I used this warmer 4 times. Each time I got an electric shock from it. I know there has to be a safer alternative. Perhaps another brand. I started to just fill up a bowl with HOT tap water and place the bottle in it for a couple of minutes. I found that to work just as well, and was not as painful as the shocks!"
1,Broken- straight from the factory!,"It never worked. We followed the directions, filled with the required amount of tap water, plugged it in and nothing happened. We left it plugged in longer, and it never warmed. We tried this a few times with no luck. So, we took it back for a refund.We found that a cheap soup-sized thermos is just as effecient if you fill it halfway with really hot tap water and dunk the bottle in it. It fits the bottle perfectly- and can be toted in the diaper bag for on the go warming. 5 stars for Thermos mugs! Oh, and you can buy a couple of these thermoses for the price of one Gerber warmer. ;) One for the house, one for on the road."
1,Bad Product,This product doesn't fit the wide bottles. So we were limited as to which bottles it would warm. Very inconvenient in the middle of the night! It is also unsafe because it doesn't have an on/off switch or an automatic shut off feature. After a few days it also collected orange crud in the bottom which would not come off with cleaning. We returned this and purchased a more versatile bottle/baby food warmer that fits all size bottles. Don't waste your money!
4,Simple and effective,"This warmer is simple, easy to use and effective. It is not as fancy as some of the other models on the market, but after trying three other brands I like this one the best. You plug it in, fill it with water (spoon included), and put in the bottle until it's warm. The spoon makes it easy to add the right amount of water (especially in the middle of the night -- you don't have to measure out milliliters like some of the other warmers!) It's also quiet, unlike some of the other brands that have loud beeping sounds. This is the only warmer I found that is good for glass or plastic bottles (although the holder is relatively narrow and will not hold a wide bottle. It is not designed for disposable bottles, either.) The only downside is that it you have to remember to unplug it and pour out the old water each time you use it. But again, it's a great value for the money and a good choice for a no-frills option."
2,Dont like it,It heats up the bottle okay but it has been known to shock you. Doesnt have an on/off switch. The water in it turned Brown and stained my bottled. Even keeping it clean!
3,Good for the price,"I received this item as a shower gift. It worked great. However, cleaning it was unpleasant because we have hard water. I used white vinegar and it helped.The only other problem I had was that the hot water in the base would sometimes bubble up through the vent holes and a few times when I was half asleep, I got drops on my hand.Overall, it warmed bottles very quickly and was easy to use."
1,if i could give it a 0 i would,this thing is worthless!! it takes to long in the middle of the night to measure the water and then it takes way to long. for the milk to warm up. and if you have long bottles then you will have two different tempatures in the bottle. don't waste your money!!!
2,Hard to use when you baby wants to eat now!,"It is cheap. That was the best thing. It is also easy to use. The bad thing is the bottle is either way to cold or burning hot. There is a very small window of time when the bottle is perfect temp. So, you have to stand there and test the bottle temp several times or else it gets too hot. It is not convienent when your baby is screaming and you have to hold her and keep testing the bottle on you arm. I am looking for a new bottle warmer. Cheap, but not worth it."
1,Waste of Time and Money,This bottle warmer does not heat more than a 4 ounce bottle. I tried a 6 and an 8 ounce and it did not heat them at all-especially since we pre-make bottles for the day and store them in the refrigerator.The best way I've found is to use a glass measuring cup almost full of water in the microwave then place the bottle in it when it's done.Please don't waste your time or money on this...the baby need not wait for this thing not to work. You will both be very frustrated!
1,"Spend more, get more","My frugal mom bought this bottle warmer for us when we brought the baby home from the hospital a week early. It worked for a short time, while she was on only 4 oz feedings. This bottle warmer is otherwise useless. I might be embarassed if I had designed this product, as GERBER bottles don't even fit in this warmer! I bought a different brand (used) after I couldn't take it anymore. I would try to sell this on e-bay, but I don't think I wish the bad quality product on anyone!"
3,Good but would not buy it again,"Its good, but lately it takes a long time to warm up, and then the formular its too hot... I dont even use it anymore."
2,Worked great for 4 months,"I purchased this unit at Sears about 2 years back. It kept me warm through the night and I could agree with other reviewers that Bionaire was a great product. After the winter was over, I put the unit away in my closet. When another winter arrived, the Biornaire heater was put to use again, but this time the unit did not perform as well. The heater shut itself off after 10 minutes; I followed the reset instruction but the heater was on for less than five minutes and shut itself off again. I called the customer service to report the problem because the unit was used for only 4 months. They offer me a replacement unit which is a HS3800-U, at my own shipping cost. The lesson here is to purchase a warranty with your bionaire products. That way, you are not struggling with a decision of whether or not you should spend money on the shipping ( both ways ) or just put that money toward a new product."
3,heater,"the heater works well in small areas - i was trying to heat a large area and ended up having to supplement with one of those red-hot, coil heaters with a reflecting back (effectively a toaster oven without a door). the bionaire works well in a small area and does not get hot enough to concern you about a fire hazard."
1,Company doesn't stand by their products,"I came very close to buying this product, but ended up choosing the ""Bionaire Micathermic Convection Heater w/ Fan"" instead. I bought it in January 2011; and heating element died February 2012 -- 13 months later. I emailed Bionaire customer service and they said they can't help me because, surprise surpries, the warantee expired.Well Bionaire ... you stink and so does your product. This item aside, would you want to give your money to a company so unwilling to stand by their product? If you have issues with your product down the road, don't you want to know the company will go above and beyond to make it right?"
3,"What a fun, interesting book!","I believe this book was written by an anthropologist, who went into the Ozarks and interviewed the local folks, collecting their folk legands, stories, and jokes. He recorded each story word-for-word as they were told to him by people of all ages - young kids to senior citizens - trying to preserve the dialect in his word spellings.It's a good study of folklore, and makes for fun reading. I got a lot of laughs from it.By the way, the book gets its name from the area south of a creek called ""Hell-for-Certain,"" pronounced in the local dialect as ""Hell-fer-Sartin.""I'd recommend it for cultural study, and especially for stress management. (A good laugh is excellent stress relief!)"
3,Average Product,I was excited to buy this product but disappointed when it arrived. The construction is OK and the item works so so. It misses some items and does not do well on pations and driveways. Does OK in a garage and cellar but cannot easily handle and surface less than perfect. I was expecting better performance and construction from an outdoor sweeper. This is on the lower end of the quality spectrum. Buy with caution.
2,"Was expecting more, too.","Does not pick up any quantity of debris. You have to move at a snails pace for it to be effective. I have used it 2 times, once on the driveway and once on a patio, and likely will never use it again. It has infomercial written all over it."
4,as advertised,"I, too, need to admit I love this thing. I buy too many gadgets - but this really works. We have an incline, rough pavement drive way that gets full of these prickly leaves from our neighbor's very strange tree. Sweeping & pick of the debris is difficult with a broom and dustpan. In addition, I have a baby ... I can actually clean our yard with this thing while holding her in about 10 min. It used to take about 30 - 40 minutes with a lot of hard sweeping."
4,Works well but not perfect obviously,"The SwinSweep Pro is not designed for fine dust applications so don't expect this to sweep to perfection. I was looking for something that easily picked up dried leaves around the garage and driveway (relatively even surfaces with a moderate gradient). It does a great job for a domestic sweeper at a fantastic price point. I looked into commercial-grade sweepers like the Haaga 255 and they cost more than 10 times the SpinSweep Pro. A comparable unit from Karcher didn't get very good reviews so I passed on that.This Hoover sweeper is not available in Australia so I'm taking a bit of a risk with parts and warranty but the very affordable price justified the purchase. It appears to be well-designed and solidly built so I'm hoping it would last a good few years at the very least. I like the ease of use, the adjustable handle length and the ability to store upright or hung on a hook."
3,sweeper,"I have a bad back, sweeper works as advertised. A vacuum would be better for me with the bad back. Picks up acorns on the drive really well."
5,Hoover sweeper,Easy to handle. No electric cords. No gas to use. No noise. Quiet. Iwould and already recommended to friends and neighbours.
3,Do a fairly good job,"We have lots of leaves on our driveway. The sweeper does a reasonable job of picking them up so long as the leaves are not piled up to much. If the leaves are layered or in a pile the sweeper will not pick them up. It will picked up small branches that came down from the oak trees. One down side is the handle. After a couple of uses it started to bend to the side. I have tried to bend it back, but to no avail."
5,Quick outdoor clean up,"This product works as advertised. It will pickup light debris from your patio and walkways without electricity or excessive noise. It does not work in corners, you will have to use a broom and move the dirt out of the corner. It has a simple, sturdy design. I was looking for a quick, easy way to remove leaves from my paved outdoor areas, without the noise of a vacuum or blower. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
3,"limited use, works on smooth surfaces fairly well","Disappointing. On blacktop, will pickup about 60% of leaves and small debris on first pass, but brushes get clocked fairly easily. Dumps effortlessly. On flagstone I found it useless and incapable of picking up the stuff that falls from the trees in the spring here in the Northeast. Made of plastic and not as robust as other lawn sweepers I've seen. I think it ought to sell for abou $30, which is about the value it has for me."
3,It works but...,"for my patio application, required almost as much effort as simply sweeping with a broom and dust pan. I had to cover the area multiple times to get all the dirt. I have a lot of corners and it cannot get into those, forcing me to get out the broom anyway. In short, there wasn't that ""WOW, this is great!"" moment when you realize that a new tool will result in a fraction of the effort. The more I pushed, the more I realized the savings in effort would be marginal at best. Back to using a blower for me."
4,Not bad...,"After reading the reviews, my expectations were really high. But the sweeper does an extremely reasonable job. I use it to clean the driveway after using the mulcher/mower.But I can't justify the cost and the sweeper is overpriced. This will probably the most expensive broom I'll ever have. But it works."
3,Not Bad,"Very lightWorks best if ground is dry, even better on smooth floors.Does not work so well going downhill.Picks fir tree needles up decently on my asphalt driveway.You have to somewhat overlap your sweep passes on rough ground."
2,"OK, but unit needs a back brush","I've owned this for two years now and it is OK. This sweeper does well for particles with some mass to it: rocks, leaves, pop cans, paper, anything but fine dust. Lacking a back brush, fine particles are merely dropped and you will see a dust trail forming along the path you walk. A back brush would make the unit larger, but it would eliminate the dust trails left by this sweeper.This sweeper is noise except on smooth ground surfaces. There is no cushioning suspension so the unit will bound around on rough surfaces. This Spin Sweep will get 80% of the sweeping of debris."
3,think small,I live on a corner lot and my yard is covered in trees. This has difficulty with large leaves such a avocodo. I has also truble with macadamia nut leaves. Small stuff it does great. I have to rake first and then use this.
2,Hoover SpinSweep is Okay but fails to be great,The problems with this sweeper are several. (1) the nubs out front designed to protect things are completely in the way preventing one from sweeping close enough. You have to use a broom to sweep debris to the center of the patio then use the sweeper. (2) Debris gets swept into and under the debris catch container requiring one to pick up the sweeper to dump this extra debris stash into a garbage bin. (3) Right wheel on my sweeper repeatedly loosens and falls off. The basic premise is good but the design is flawed.
3,Okay for the price but I would spend a little more on a different Sweeper,"It works fairly well picking up leaves an grass. If you are trying to sweep a garage or warehouse floor then you have go rather slow to keep from spinning things off to each side. All and all it is a good unit, If I was to do it over again I would get one with additional side or rear brushes."
4,Reliable Paper is Unreliable,I bought this product from Reliable Paper and it had a missing part. They refused to remedy the problem resulting in my need to buy the part directly from Hoover. Do not rely on Reliable Paper.
3,Not totally Region 1 ...,"The video quality is great ... but, the sound will not play on my Region 1 DVD. Goes against Amazon's desire for Region 1 play OR advertised otherwise."
2,not as pictured on site,"This picture is not the item I received ,the filter I received did not have the black netting around it (which is the better one that has an antibacterial agent built in) so do not be fooled by the picture .The filter is still a good one but as I said it is not the one that is pictured."
1,Item Received has Different Part Number Than Advertised,"CAVEAT EMPTOR !! The original filter that came with my humidifier was a ""Permanent"" i.e., washable filter, hence the HWF75P part number. I ordered this filter which is listed on AMAZON as HWF75PDQ-U. The item that was delivered, was a HWF75 and the package states this filter is only good for up to six weeks. This is clearly not the filter I thought I ordered. I will probably keep this and use it until it is spent, only because nobody stocks this filter locally and I need to use the humidifier now. I will not purchase another."
4,"Replacement for Holmes ""D"" filter","I have had a horrible time trying to locate the Holmes D filter after purchasing theHUMIDIFIER COOL MIST CONSOLE. Thank goodness for Amazon. This is the exact replacement filter for the Holmes model number 3655U. The price is a little higher than I expected but since I can not find them any place else and I can get the filter shipped for free with Prime, I don't mind paying a little bit more."
2,clean air,This product did not work as long as other filters have in the past. The metal frame was not what I was expecting. Just not sure I want to reorder.
2,two weeks & done,These filters do not wick correctly. They last about two weeks then they are garbage. They don't even wick that great brand new out of the package. Tried soaking them in dish washing detergent. Then vinegar & water. Nothing. Still looking for a suitable replacement for my sunbeam Model SCM3609. They are the right size but that's about it.
1,Have not received my product. It's been over a month.,I've not received the product nor have I received any communication from the seller. I believe I got ripped off.
2,Humidifier filter,The holmew HWF75 is the worst filter I ever used. If you want a great filter that wicks properly go with the Honeywel HC14. You can get it at The Buy it Now store.
1,Only good for two weeks!,"I waited a while to write this review, and I'm glad I did. The filter worked great for about two weeks. After that, the humidifier indicated the filter needed replacement. I checked the filter over and any part that was more then an inch above the water level was totally dry.I took the filter and tried washing it out in the sink. This gave the filter almost one full week of good use again. The drying out then happened again, so I repeated the wash/scrub. This time it didn't even last for two days.If I want my humidifier to work with this filter, I have to wash it and soak it multiple times a day!My original filters would last all season without any problems. I thought I was going to save a few bucks with these, but I guess I learned my lesson. Don't bother buying these filters!!!"
3,Ok. Bad smell,They work fine. They have a bad smell to them. I had to take them all out of the boxes and air them out and spray them with fabrize.
2,Misrepresentation!,"The product I received was not the product pictured. The part numbers do not even match! The pictured product has a black outer membrane; the product I received did not. The shipping container used was simply the cardboard packaging the original product, turned inside-out. It also had the original sticker price on the packaging of $2.09. I feel completely ripped-off!"
3,Good but...,This is a good replacement product for my Holmes cool mist humidifier but it does not fit as the description said. I had to cut it at the seam and make it smaller to fit the HM1895 model. Still it is cheaper then the Holmes filters and worth the minor inconvenience.
3,Humidifier Filter,Filter seems to work well and continues to stay wet without any major care. Only concern is that the black webbing around the outside seem fragile and breaks after a short time of use.
2,Humidifier Filters,"Filters arrived promptly. Disappointed with quality, as the one filter we have used thus far has fallen apart after just 2 weeks of use."
4,HM3650 Humidifier filter/wick replacement,"The filters appear to be OEM quality, no problem.A little pricey but worth the convenience since these filter/wicks are getting hard to find."
1,Generic Brand is much Lower Quality than Holmes Filter,There is a huge difference between the generic and the OEM filters. They don't last anywhere near as long. We use 4-5 of the generic filters for every Holmes manufactured filter and that is a costly proposition. The generics stop wicking after a short while and are then completely worthless.
3,Won't last a season,"We used to be able to count on a Holmes filter to last a season. Yes, we had to rotate the filter with each complete filling, and we washed them in the tub every couple months, but we could count on a full season of usage. This batch didn't even make it through the end of January. Disappointing, and we'll be looking for alternatives."
2,Poor performance,"This product has a very limited wicking property. A few days after installation, the evaporation of water was substantially reduced."
1,only last a week or two,I bought three of the Holmes HWF75 filters and they lasted for less than a month. The top of the filter will dry out and not wick water. I hate to say it but I think they are designed to fail.
4,Holmes Replacement Filter,"Cheaper option for my humidifier, but the quality isn't as good (sometimes splits apart a bit), and doesn't last as long."
1,humidifier filters,"I have purchased official Holmes filters as well as aftermarket products for over 5 years. The ones purchased here are absolutely worthless. They last 48 hours then cease to absorb and wick the water, thereby not allowing the machine to humidify the house. I will have to look elsewhere to purchase replacement filters.The service was good - the supplier of the product to the vendor supplied an inferior product."
1,holmes hwf75,This filter has been in use now for two weeks and has already lost its ability to wick water up into it as when it was brand new. Very disappointed that it already needs to be changed.
1,Two weeks and it dried out,I have had my Holmes humidifier for years. Until I bought these filters I would use 2 filters each winter. After 2 weeks I noticed that the humidifier wasn't using up the water it normally would and that the filter was dry as a bone above water level and not wicking. Normally the dry part of the filter turns brown before it dries out. This one still was white. If these are from Holmes they have changed the makeup of the filter and I will be looking for replacement filters elsewhere.
1,Lacks clarity and objectivity,"I purchased this book for Mass Communications 101 and have not been pleased, to say the least. My understanding of textbooks is that they are to be as unbiased and objective as possible in presenting all the given, relevant material on a subject. This textbook is poorly organized, poorly written, and riddled with helpful statements like ""...this is what makes the Times the best newspaper in the world."" Really only usable as a doorstop."
3,"Different spin, same results.","I read this book and thought that although the idea was a bit different and there may be some credibility to the apple/pear theory, in the end it all goes back to diet and exercise. This may help people to recognize what their health issues ""might"" be and address them in a pro active way. Losing weight, however is the same ole excercise, low cal diet, etc. She tries to suggest what foods each type should avoid and I did not really buy that."
5,An apple a day...,"I picked up this book when I was frustrated over hitting a plateau and couldn't understand why things weren't working. Afterall, I was exercising five days, sometimes six, a week. I was eating low-carb and not getting to my goal. I've always known I was an apple girl, but I didn't know what to do with that information. Dr. Savard's book really put me at ease and opened my eyes! I now have real, honest advice that is not another gimmick. And it's about so much more than your diet...it's about your overall health as a woman. I've lost half an inch around my waist and I feel less cranky and tired. I'm relieved to know that apples can have healthy bread and eat fruit! So, it's an apple a day for me. :-)"
1,Missing material,Received item & was missing dvds. No resolution from original vendor. But Amazon refunded my money.
1,Does Not Work/ Too Expensive to Return,Bought for Nokia phone. Everything plugs in perfectly. No charge whatsoever after several hours. Packaging written in terribly broken english. Costs twice as much as price of charger to return to Hong Kong for refund. I threw it away and feel bad for contributing more waste to our bulging landfill. Dont waste your time or money.
2,It's barely readable. The print is too small. Was not aware that pgs were photocopies taken from an older manuscript.,The print is too small. Was not aware that pgs were photocopies taken from an older manuscript. Description of product was not fully disclosed on purchase site.
1,Doesn't make much sense.,"Actually, I tossed the book after looking through it for a couple of hours. The writer seems to have to stretch awfully far in his conclusions, and nothing is very clear. I really don't ""get"" the book."
5,Simply...MAGNIFICENT!,"This is the best soundtrack ever written...bar none! It's exciting...my heart pounds every time I hear it. You can almost smell the gun powder. It's like you're right there with The Seven fighting it out! I think I've gotten dust in my eyes just listening to it. If you like good music, get this CD! You won't regret it, amigo."
3,Wrong film!,"The video described here is the animated film with voices from the original BBC radio play--Richard Burton; Hugh Griffiths; Rachel Roberts, etc.The two reviews above relate to the film version of Under Milk Wood that starred Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor!"
3,Under Milk Wood,This is a useful introduction to the radio play for students who find it difficult to visualize the play for themselves. It has more moments of real imagination than the poor very literal live action version with Burton and the badly miscast Elizabeth Taylor.
1,Proofreader needed,"I was very disappointed in the story, but even more disappointed by the number of errors in the book. More often than not the word ""hear"" appeared as ""here."" The author has no clue how to use an apostrophe to to denote a possessive as opposed to just a plural word. Very annoying throughout the book. Weak story line with a random ending to it. Cannot recommend this book."
4,Christianity and the Active Life in the Twentieth Century,"Thomas Merton never ceases to amaze in his ability to express, in concrete, down-to-earth terms, how to incorporate a robust Roman Catholic spirituality in an active, contemporary life. Although he was writing as a monk, Merton's call to personal holiness in the active, non-monastic life is incisive, convincing and completely on point. Merton explains in clear terms how one can, and indeed must, maintain deep, active concern for the events that surround us, and be an active participant in these events, in order to cultivate and fully develop our individual capacity for personal holiness. A tremendous work, highly recommendable for anyone seeking guidance regarding how a passionate spirituality can be integrated into an active and busy life."
2,no website videos,"Got the book, but the promised website with videos is 'under construction' I'm giving low stars because of this."
4,"""The Book Rules""","Ok, I have not ""yet"" finished Dr. Bergman's compilation. However, I must say that I have a unique insight into its origins, namely its editor, Thomas Bergmann. As a student of Northwestern Health Sciences University, I am privilaged to attend Dr. Bergmann's Methods III lecture and laboratory several times a week. I also am fortunate enough to sit in on his Principles and Philosophy of Chiropractic lectures. These experiences have taught me a great deal about Chiropractic science and practice in just a short few weeks as a trimester 3/10 student here at NWHS. I have learned a lot so far and continue to learn more every day. I believe Dr. bergmann to be a giant in the field of Chiropractic Technique. While my opinion may be swayed a bit and my history in the field limited, this is my opinion. Don't believe me? Buy the book!!!!!!!"
4,Red House Painters 1,"Buying this album on the basis of one hearing on the radio, when I eventually played it in full I was struck by by the crystal clarity of the vocals backed in most part by some understated and yet beautiful guitar.I still know very little about the band but with fourteen tracks and a running time of over seventy-five minutes, sit back and savour what is surely an almost secret gem.All tracks stand out, often building from quiet beginnings.A personal favourite is ""Mistress"". Red House Painters deserve to be noticed. A convert. PAB"
3,"this isn't the best RHP album, but..","""Katy Song"" is their best song ever. It's amazing how such a simple song can evoke so many concrete memories. And the fadeout.. try not to get a little tearyeyed when you hear that.Unfortunately, the rest of this album isn't as good. To be honest, the only song I thought matched ""Katy Song"" (or even came close to) was ""Grace Cathedral Park."" I need to give it a few more listens, though. Who knows? I hated Ocean Beach at first, and now that's my favorite RHP album..PS: for new RHP listeners, go straight for ""Songs for a Blue Guitar."""
3,nobody looovvves meeeee,"I think of this cd as the soundtrack every girl secretly wants to be playing during their most romantic moments...but if any guy i knew owned this cd and played it on a date, i'd assume he's either a) much too sensitive, or b) trying too hard to seem sensitive. i found it a little hard to take seriously, like when he sings ""bruised internally...eternally"". call me hardhearted but that makes me laugh. beyond that, it's a little repetitive, so you have to be ready to get really depressed if you're going to listen to the whole thing. But I liked some moments of it-an ignorant music non-connoisseur"
5,magnificent album,"I love all work from Mark Kozelek, but his albums in front of Red House Painters are incredible and this is one of the best like RHP II, Down Colourfull Hill and Ocean Beach..."
1,Big Book a Dispointment,"This book didn't arrive until December after I ordered it prior to the publisher's announced October release date (no fault of Amazon).This should have been a clue that something was wrong with it. I am sorry to say I'm very disapointed with the ""Atlas"". I thought it would be a scholarly book with quality maps and images. Instead it is a bloated, oversized coffee table book printed on glossy paper that will probably end up on the remainder table. The plates are decent enough except that they cover only a small part of the huge pages. The maps probably have detail in them somewhere but they too have such small print that one needs a magnifying glass to read them. It gets one star for the map pockets on the inside front and back covers. Too bad they only hold more glossy too large/too small maps. I would advise anyone to forego this book and instead spend the $60 they'll save on one the Moulton U of Nebraska editions."
1,Oasa 2400 gal. jet pump,No service in U.S. has 2 yr. service w/pur. can't be done. Fountain is GREAT however if it should break your out 500.oo Qase motor can not be fixed in U.S.better off looking elseware
5,Excellent figure,"I bought this in June 2010, along withWorld of Warcraft Series 5: Night Elf Hunter: Alathena Moonbreeze with Sorna Action FigureandWorld of Warcraft Series 3 Draenei Mage Action Figure. All are still in perfect condition, save for Tamuura's sword; but that apparently is a common problem.Other than the one I mentioned above, I have not had a single issue with ANY of these figures. None of them have fallen, and none have broken. I bought a sturdy bookshelf specifically for them. They will only fall if someone knocks the shelf around, never on their own.I can see that her details aren't near as refined as the rest, but then again I am comparing her with the later series; Given that she was one of the first made, I can understand it. This is still a beautiful figure that is worth buying for any collector."
1,Not made very well...,She started to bow and lean forward off of her stand within a month. And her dagger broke off unexpectedly. I would not suggest on purchasing.
2,common Corporate marketing,This is a very nice piece yes. Only a few problems with it. It is the most cheaply made piece out of the series. My guess is they made it out of cheap product because they knew that the Male Genre would boost the sales regardless just because she's scantily clad. All the other pieces of the series; even the Warlock with the Three piece Staff are made better than this piece. They may as well have just made this into a Blow Up Adult Toy because that's about the quality it is and what the piece is used for by most teens out there that play this game.
2,A rare disappointment from the Moosewood collection,"Just a warning that no nutritional breakdown of the recipes (e.g. calories, fat, fiber, carbohydrates) is provided. This is a big miss considering the number of people that use this information to calculate Weight Watcher points or determine insulin units needed.The selection of recipes is good and geared to a more simple and speedy preparation. So not a complete waste - just more effort if you need the nutritional guide."
2,Not what expected from Moosewood,"I borrowed this book from the library after reading, using, and loving two other Moosewood books. I ended up returning the book the same day. Many (majority) of the recipes used processed food items and were of the basic everyday throw your food together design. I love simple, good food recipes but this book was similar to the grocery store checkout line type. I would highly recommend the original Moosewood cookbook and the Low-Fat Moosewood cookbook but not this one as it lacks in originality and in using fresh, healthy ingredients."
5,Instant Classic,"Moosewood Simple Suppers have transformed a career woman who lived in fear of coming home to cook into a gleeful culinary queen. This cookbook features the easiest, most appetizing, healthy-hearty food that I literally live to cook and eat. My friends are probobly sick of hearing me expout on the many virtues of Moosewood Simple Suppers. This is my new favorite anyone any time gift. My husband swears he simply feels better after eating a Moosewood meal and has professed that he could live as a vegetarian if he ate Moosewood Suppers every night.Don't miss the Navajo Stew, Cilantro Omelet w/ German Potato Salad, and Peach Brown Betty...yummmmmm"
2,"go with ""Vegetarian Suppers"" instead...","Thought I would love this book, as I've loved Deborah Madison's newest, Vegetarian Suppers. This book was a disappointment--lots of simple recipes, but nothing that sounded like hey, I've got to try that! You probably have recipes similar to these in the book if you have a few vegetarian cookbooks anyway. I brought this one back to the store (a rarity for me--I'm a cookbook fiend!)."
5,More great ideas from the Moosewood people,"If you're looking for food that's healthy, tasty and easy to prepare, I don't think the Moosewood cookbooks can be beat. While I've only tried a couple of recipes from this new cookbook, they've both been good and simple to put together, and I'm looking forward to trying many more. I love to cook, and I love to try new dishes, but I'm also interested in staying slender and in not spending too much time in the kitchen: Moosewood achieves all of that for me. I especially appreciate their ""serving and menu ideas,"" in which they make suggestions for what you may want to serve with the current recipe to make a whole meal -- very nice for entertaining. If you don't own any Moosewood cookbooks, the ""Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home"" is probably the one to start with. With that one and this one together, however, you'd have a formidable collection of recipes. Enjoy!"
5,Great weeknight cookbook!,"This has become one of my favorite cookbooks, the recipes are healthy, creative and delicious! Best of all they are easy enough to prepare after work. I highly recommend this cookbook for those who don't want to spend an hour preparing dinner."
5,EROTIC ISSUE,AN OLD MAGAZINE WITH HIDDEN SURPRISES.ACTRESS SUSAN CLARKE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY IN AN INTERESTING PICTORIAL PORTRAYING VARIOUS WOMEN.MARIA SCHNEIDER IS EXPLOSIVE IN HER EXTREMELY NUDE PICTORIAL AFTER HER WORLDWIDE SUCCESS IN THE LAST TANGO IN PARIS WITH THE GREAT MARLON BRANDO.A COLLECTORS MUST.
5,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book. It gives enough detail and helps beginners as well as veterans. However it will not take the place of actual experience.
1,"Don't buy it, RUN!!!!!","I bought the software trying to back up my ipod onto another computer, the stupid software kept saying ""Refreshing Data..."" when I clicked on ""Detect iPod"" and that's where it sat. I also had trouble installing it with the Java Runtime Environment initializing and running over the installation. The website sucks, and your guys are right about no support, there isn't even any comments section for other customers to help eachothere out. Maybe Best Buy will have mercy and take it back."
1,WILL NOT WORK WITH THE IPOD NANO 4GB,Please avoid this program. It will not work with the IPOD Nano. There are no instructions and the web site doesn't even support this product anymore.
1,Didn't work,Bought this to transfer i-pod tunes to new computer..however it didnt work and the patch didn't work either
1,Stuck an image on my desktop!,"Not only couldn't I get this program to work, it left an image behind! Yup, smack in the middle of my desktop screen is a square with Toon Tools for iPod ad. I uninstalled and reinstalled and uninstalled and I can't get this damned thing off my computer!Aarrgghh!!"
2,Doesn't work on iPod touch or iPhone,"I was very dissapointed with this product. Once I installed it, I couldn't get it to work. Then I read on the box that it is not compatible with the iPod touch or iPhone. This information would have been helpful on the website."
2,ipod to ipod,if you by this product to trade songs from ipod to ipod you have to do it through a computer.
1,Useless,"There is bad software, and then there is Terrible Software and then there is unbelievably sloppy Terrible software. This falls under the latter category. I own a Mac so my reviews are based on APPLE platform. I think the code might have been written in a Chinese Labor Factory for Windows and then sloppily copied onto the Mac Platform. I don't know for sure. I just know for sure that it fails to do anything correct, and it fails erratically. However, one thing is consistent and that is, it doesn't do S***."
1,Terrible product!!!!,No instructions. No technical support. It is worthless!! I don't understand why ValuSoft is selling this product. Its a huge rip off.
1,Don't Bother,"The installed failed. The application is written in Java which is not a bad thing but it needs to install a companion application called a JRE so it will run. The JRE failed misirably to install and thus the application will not run at all.If you go to the company website [...] you get a nice message saying the domain name has expired and if you are the owner, you can renew it.Needless to say, this application rates a big fat zero in my book."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I, like other reviewers, spent a lot of time installing and reinstalling this software. It never recognized my ipod. It would not even load if I had my ipod connected. Don't bother with this application."
2,Not very compatible with i tunes,"I think it should be more compatible with i tunes, because the conflict between two is difficult to manage. Every time you use several ipods in the sakme ocmputer you have to avoid the itunes because it could erease the new ipod."
2,Fairly useless,I bought this to back up my iPod before I left the country. It worked a few times until it kept freezing. The patches on their webpage do not solve the problem either.Their website is labyrinthian at best. There are definitely better products out their with more effective customer service (a contact link is practically buried) that don't want to install additional junk on your PC.
4,Chocolatina,I liked this book because I love chocolate! It was a funny book! Yes I would recommend this book to any person who likes chocolate and comedy.
1,Frightening and filled with sadism,"I thought this book was totally mean-spirited and filled with sadism that would certainly scare any child. In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book. Children look up to the adults in their lives, especially to their teachers, and this book portrays the teacher as cruel and nasty. This book was deeply disturbing for both myself and more importantly, for my son."
4,Wicked Chocolate,A delightful book to be shared with all your chocaholic friends! And the art is as enchanting as the tale.
5,GREAT!,"Chocolatina is a wonderful book of all ages. Many students have a love a chocolate and that makes this a perfect book for them. I read this book to my fourth grade students every year. I bought this copy for a co-worker, she loves chocolate as well. :)"
2,Wow has the quality changed.,"This was a third purchase of this same product. Granted, I hadn't re-purchased in over a year, but I guess it was a bad year for this product. While the outside colors seemed to be the same, it was the overall quality that really suffered. The clear plastic liner, which was once sturdy and substantial, is now extremely thin, and seems to be very easily torn or damaged. The closures, which used to be very snug and tight, now barely grip to hold the sleeve closed. The inside now has an almost ""matte"" appearance to it, instead of the gloss it used to have. The hub is very ""hit or miss"". Some hold well, some don't hold at all, and some grip too tight which could damage the DVD. Very disappointed in what used to be a great product."
5,Memorex Slim DVD Video - 25 clear,"This product serves me well, takes less space and easy to see what is in the holder. I use it for cds and dvds both."
5,Love the colors,"These are the motherlode. Memorex has stuck with the original design ""spoke hub"" on this style case and I can't praise them enough. The clear cover and color case makes the presentation of the movie almost as exciting as the movie itself (ok... maybe I exaggerate)."
5,SUPER DVD protecters,"If you collect movies and want to put your on spin on your cover, you have plenty of space.Its a great way to protect and catalog your DVD. We love them..."
4,Perfect for those miscellaneous DVD's,I was looking to organize those leftover DVD's and DVD's without cases. This was perfect for them! The color's are great and they are slim so I can store a lot in a small space. Great value for the price
3,"okay mask, but i've seen better","i'm not a fan of these types of Batman masks. a Batman mask should wrap around the head completely for full Batman effect, but these 3/4 masks leave the back of your head exposed and use an elastic band to keep it on your head. and why else don't you ever see any other pics of these masks from any angle other than the front? because Rubie's doesn't want the buyer to see that the back of your head is exposed when you wear it. the exposed back and elastic band make the mask fit too loosely, so it shifts around a lot, requiring much repositioning. maybe if you wear one of those black winter weather ""head socks"" underneath to cover your hair, it'll look better. the full head TDK Batman masks that Rubie's makes are better than these."
3,"Cute, but size is not 3-12 months as stated in the description","I purchased this for my 6 month old, who is in 9 month clothing - 17 lbs.When the item arrived, the packaging indicated it was for a 12-18 month old and it is much too big for my baby to wear."
3,Woudn't recommend,"I'm just back from Sylvan where I passed this test and I woudn't recommend this book to anyone preparing for the exam. The biggest problem is the book is not written for this exam. Actually it does include a lot of instresting and useful info, but it's hidden behind off topics and you're not getting a clear message what this exam is about and what you should know of and how deep. A good book should be focused on the subject and this one is not. I haven't noticed any exceptionally well covered areas (many are covered well enough, but not better then in the other books), so I wouldn't recommend this book as a secondary source either."
3,"Flawed, but useable","Coriolis Press normally turns out very good books. This one seemed to escape the final technical and editorial proofreading that I would expect a major publisher to subject books to prior to publishing them. There are numerous figures that are wrong, labeled incorrectly, or both. For example, look at the figures on pages 57 and 58; all three are the same picture, with none of them being labeled properly... There are also a number of lists that have obvious mistakes in them. If that were all, it might not be too bad, but there are other less obvious mistakes as well. I ended up wondering how much of what I read was actually correct, and was left with a realization that you must read this book with a discerning eye. When I checked the Coriolis support page there was no errata for this book. The section on DNS was good, as was the chapter on WINS. Use with caution. Two and a half stars."
1,this book was terrible,"the index to the cheats was incorrect. Many if the ""cheats"" did not work. Half of the games that I own were not in the book. Any of the cheats to any game can be found on the internet so there no point in buying unless you dont have the internet. Hopefully you do.With so many games being produced this book we soon be out of date. You could get these from any cheats website."
2,More calendar than gardening book,Based on the description I thought that I would be receiving a book on the basics of Colorado gardening. What I received was a weekly calendar with many lists and tips. The book is set up like a weekly calendar with one week per page. On the page margins and bottom are gardening tips. Each month does give a 2 page sample design and best/worst plant lists. While there are lots of good tips and lists this is more a calendar then a gardening book.
3,Reviving old filters,"When these filters became virtually unavailable a few years back I tried soaking the old one one I had in vinegar every time I did a major cleaning of the humidifier, on the theory that the vinegar will reinvigorate the filter by dissolving the minerals which have been captured by the filter. It seems to work - we have had no white dust problems with the filters so treated, and have so cleaned that one filter several dozen times now."
5,I can't believe I finally own this soundtrack!,"My sister and I have been searching for this soundtrack forever. I have to say it's well worth the wait! Anyone who liked the movie will be blown away! My only complaint is that they left out ""Diddley Daddy"" by Chris Issak. (That's the song playing when Kate and Doug are playing Hockey) Other than that-it's awesome! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"
4,Almost as good as the movie,"The Cutting Edge is a fun movie, Moira Kelly plays a great diva ice skater. The sound track is good with the exception of Cry All Night by Neverland that does not quite fit in. A few of the original movie songs have been omitted and I was disappointed they were not on the CD, but overall listening to this will bring back fond memories of the movie."
4,"Great music, but felt as if it was missing something","I have been searching hi and low for this soundtrack, since '92 and now I finally have it. I am completely in love with the music on this soundtrack, but I was hoping to hear ""The Race"" and that one by Chris Issack. Maybe I can find them somewhere, soon."
2,no ethnic differences,"I thought this book did not address critical issues about ethnic differences regarding divorce.Considering that the divorce rate for African Americans is so much higher than it is for European Americans, the book seems to have a big hole in it."
2,"Very simple and obvious, 80% of the book is not useful","In case you look for a very basic list of basic things related to photography, this book is probably useless for you. It has a lot of content related to non-digital cameras, which probably is irrelevant to most readers today. And it is very superficial. I only take away a few tips on low light photography, but that is not worth the price of the book."
3,Taking pics,There seems to be a lot of good info in here but its not easy to get to. A lot of the book is still dedicated to 35mm film photography and it's format is not very easy to use. I would have preferred a book with ring binding or something and maybe heavier construction for field use.
3,Travel Image Subject Matter Inspiration,"An okay little book with lots of tips and hints on travel photography. The real strength of this book is the coverage of potential subject matter, providing plenty of food for thought. If your a beginner you may find coverage of the basics a bit brief, though there is still useful content in these early sections of the book for all. As an early intermediate picture taker, I found the lens aperture and shutter speed information included with most of the images useful in understanding the scope and context of those combinations selected for the different subjects. If you know your way around your camera equipment and are looking for some inspiration on what to photograph on that once in a lifetime trip, then take a look at this book. It is small enough that you can take it with you without adding too much to the baggage."
2,Does not stick,It doesn't really stick onto the cracked exhaust manifold/catalytic converter. The layer of Thermosteel I applied even cracked after it got heated. Its easy to take out too.
1,Not for use on gas stove grates,"I tried to use this to repair a stove grate (the thing that sits on top of the fire on the stove), didn't work well for me."
2,exhausting repair,if the car was upsidedown you mght be able to apply the water based mixture carefully so as not to have it on the floor whilst you dab overhead. i used a full container on a hole which failed 4 days later
1,waste of money,"This stuff is junk, followed the directions and it will not hold. Do not waste your time or money on this. It is pure junk."
5,Delivers the goods,"The DVD delivers exactly what it says, a guide to painting helmets. Watching this guy work makes the airbrush look like it the easiest thing in the world to use.This Dvd is a very practicle guide (monkey see, monkey do)"
2,"Their weakest album, I guess.","This is a collection of outtakes and leftovers from the ""Rollercoaster"" album, and it's instantly noticeable why these songs were excluded from that album: except for ""New Jersey"" and ""Uncle Joe"", this is simply weak material. If you're a serious fan, you may like this, but novices should head for one of the other RHP albums first."
5,baby digital thermometer,"I like this protect simply because it is easy to use and easy to read. Not only is it easy to read, but when it is time to take a baby's temperature they are not always cooperative. It is especially difficult to take baby's temperature rectal when they are irritable. So, I like this because the temperature can be taken three different ways, which is also good for accuracy."
5,Great book,This book is one of the best books I have read in the field of undercover drug work. The book is a very easy read and shows the sacrifice that so many make and never get recognition for. I would strongly recommend this book.
3,Kept waiting for the excitement,"While the story chapters in the book are individually interesting, they somehow don't make a whole. The book feels choppy, as if it needed additional narrative to make if flow more smoothly. I expected, based on other reviews, to become immersed in the life of a narcotics officer. Just a average read."
2,Decent,"This was a decent book. Basically, if you're into reading about small busts by the DEA without being a little annoyed by someone way overglorifying the busts, then this is your book. Otherwise, there's way more interesting true crime books out there."
1,disappointing,If you've listened to Tom Kenyon's Ghandarma and are looking for something similar you'll be disappointed. This music is completely different and the experience is not spiritual. This is ordinary background music
4,"Not well known, but contains some gems.","This album marked the beginning of the end of MTB's commercial success. It was also the last album recorded with founding member Tommy Caldwell who was tragically killed in a car accident just a month after the release of 'Tenth'. While it is not as solid beginning-to-end as earlier albums, there are a couple of MTB's best songs here: 'Foolish Dreaming', ""See You One More Time' and 'Cattle Drive' are each on my 'Best of Tucker' list."
1,The title of this book really bugs me,"How about ""How would MARY raise a child""?It strikes me as very belittling of women and the importance of mothers in general."
5,I love this book!,This book offers fabulous recipes and gift ideas. Suggestions include gift baskets for just about anyone and lots of special surprises to make someone's day. There is lots of humor (which will especially appeal to chocolate lovers!) and lots of inspiration. This book is excellent for women everywhere!
2,Lots and lots of make believe,In this movie everybody is acting. Which should be good but I mean acting like they love sex. Max at night gives you a better show. Only thing different is that they are Orientals. So if you like to see far eastern couples play at making love this is a winner for you.
2,Spirit of Homeopathic Medicine,"The remedies referenced in this book are used in examples primarily concerning infants and children. The descriptions of the remedies are also very brief. It was a useful additional reference source to have on the shelf, but definitely not useful for beginners."
5,splendid and extremely useful,With an unbelievable insight in some 300 homeopathic medicines Didier Grandgeorge gives us in a nutshell the essence (the spirit) of these remedies. Till now I've not read any book that gives so accurate and enlightening information about the remedies. The information is kept (very) short and very very to the point so you are not overwhelmed by too much details. This book is a gem and very useful for parents too since the author gives a lot of characteristics of children's behaviour and the suitable remedy. This book lets you find in a minimum of time the right (!) similum.
1,"Superficial, not at all useful for classical homeopaths",I do NOT recommend this book to any serious student or practitioner of classical homeopathy.
4,Loud? yes. Works? yes.,"Ok this machine IS noisy, but certainly not annoying to any degree. Sounds like a fan, not a motor. I recently changed the filter and noticed that it had picked up a ton of airborne dirt and debri. I also feel less stuffy in the morning. So, I will happily accept the fan noise and highly recommend this unit! It's also rather inexpensive for what it can do. Overall, a sound investment."
3,Good product overall,"I own this for approx 4 month now and its been working fine. The only thing that I have noticed is that it is loud when turn on high (Like a Fan). I leave it on the entire day and now it seems that it is making a lauder noise (even on Medium). If you dont mind the noise that this product makes, then buy it. If you want something that its quite, find something else."
1,poor quality/noisy obtrusive tower,"Wish I read other reviews before I bought this product. First, it's much larger and obtrusive than expected. Quality looks cheap (though it attempts to look like the ionic breeze in style),and when you turn it on it's noisy - even on the low range. Put it on high and the noise level rises dramatically. Have noticed no real improvement in air quality. Stay away from this one."
1,Very Noisy!!,I was looking for a cheaper version to my Ionic Breeze Quadra...This is definitely not it. I can't believe how loud this was on low. I don't really see anything being pulled into it either when I kick up some dust. It's going back to the store today.
1,you are wasting your money!,I have purchased 4 of these in the past 2 years and 3 of them quit working after 1 year. Do yourself a favor and go with honeywell........you will regret tossing money away on these!
1,Awful,"I bought this unit at my local K-Mart cause I could not wait till it shipped due to extreme hay fever this year. Plain and simple, this thing is NOISY, even on the lowest setting. They say it is quiet on the box but it is not. This thing could wake the dead. I am boxing it up and returning it this evening. DO NOT waste your time or money on this piece of junk."
1,Piece of Junk!!!!,Stay away from this one!!! Did not last more than 8 hours. It just stopped working!!!!! Don't waste your time or money on this one.
3,"It is noisy, but works for us.","I was hoping for a more quiet, blowing sound myself, but I put the purifier on a foam pad and it's quieter. I have found that it really works in cleaning the air in our bedroom. We used to wake up with stuffy noses, but since having it on low all night, we wake up with clear noses. And the constant white noise type sound helps with the traffic noise outside. So all in all, we are happy enough with the product."
1,horrible,"i got mine from target. i initally bought it to circulate the air in my room and not necessarily to filter it...it certainly did the job of moving the air and filtering it.however, after only about a month of use this thing started squeaking/chirping.. and it just got worse as the days went by...after 2 months of use it wouldn't even start right. i would put it on the highest setting and it would just hum like it was on the lowest setting and then eventually get up to speed (after a few hours, sometimes days).i am thisclose to throwing this in the trash because it makes so much noise. as soon as i use up the new filters i bought for it, it's going in the trash.the noise is just unbearably loud. sounds like a bearing has lost its lubrication and is just rubbing plastic to rubber.very annoying."
1,low quality plus crappy style--stay away!,"I bought this at walmart for $70, because the picture on the box looks kinda like the sharper image ionic breeze (but it's not!). it requires you to remove the wraper on 2 filters inside, which is easy enough. Like the ionic breeze I had, it wasn't able to clear out the paint smell my new apartment have. But I figure I would give it a couple more days before I return it. 2 days later when I try to unplug it and move it to another electrical outlet, the LED indicators burned out. It is now on it's 5th day and the fan seems to be noiser than before--as loud as my frig. I knew for $70 I can't ask for much, but knowing what I know now I wouldn't even take it if it's free."
5,Air purifiers are bid plus in controlled asthmatic environment.,I bought this first because I am asthmatic and I have grandkids and granddogs that I love to visit with.It did such a good job that I'm going to recommend that my children purchase one for my grandchildren s bedrooms. His product with the natural charcoal filters is the best.
4,Good product for money,"Blows out cold air, but that's the purified air. Just point it away from you and you won't even notice it's there. Noticed less sneezing in the morning since I've started using it."
5,works great,it's a bit loud on the highest setting but other than that it works great.. this is my 2nd one now. The first is 2 years old and sounds like it might be on it's way out.. but still going.. wanted one for the bedroom & one for our main living space.. easy to remember when to change the filters with the dial on the top
2,doa,"product arrived on time and in good shape, unfortunetly it would not accept a charge so I returned the item for a refund. the return process was very easy."
2,Not an interchangeable charger for Moto Q Global,"Well, so far I can't tell you how it works, because the one that arrived doesn't work. It wouldn't take a charge. That brings me to the charger. My previous Motorola phone and headset charger were interchangeable, that is, you could use the charger for both the phone and the headset. I assumed this would be the case in ordering another Motorola headset for my new phone. Sadly, it is not. The charger adapter plug is not a micro-USB, and only works for the headset.This is also similar to other Motorola headsets that don't have an ear plug built into the receiver, so it sits outside the ear, instead of in the ear. This may affect your purchase.It does come with two other ear hooks, which I thought was nice."
5,Awesome,The Motorola H670 is one of the best bluetooth headsets i've ever used. It's has a very nice design and comfort. Highly recommend it and seller was great.
1,Isn't it suppose to work?,I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Today she wanted to use it .But It wouldn't charge or turn on. I received it at 7 JAN 2009 .Next how can i do. I very trust Amazon before.so I will buy something on wedsite carefully in the furter!!!!!!!!
2,A bit forced,"I was really captivated by the beginning of this book but as it progressed it all seemed a bit forced. There was too much focus on subplots and not enough on the truly interesting central story. And the ""magical realism"" seemed to lose steam as well. I was very disapointed that the book didn't live up to its inital promise. An OK book, not great. It doesn't make me want to read another DeBernieres."
2,Way short of Marques,"I greatly admire this author and his work, but this is not a very good novel. It draws its stylistic inspiration from Latin American writers, most importantly Gabriel Garcia Marques, but is not as successful. It relies too much on an alien imagination, and too little on the true culture, history and mythology of Latin America. The result, especially with its graphically violent portrayal of the sufferings of the Coca lords' victims, is almost voyeuristic. It's certainly gratuitous in places. I also think that the blend of 'magic' realism with a conventional contemporary story does not work here."
3,Decent Gloves but not very practical.,"These gloves are decent and comfortable, however, as glove liners they are not very warm. I have skied several times with these and my great outer gloves made by Outdoor Research and I found my fingers were still extremely cold. On the other hand, when I wore these in Seattle with the temperature in the 40s, I found them to be a little too warm.Also the stitching in between the thumb and pointer finger is a little odd. But that is really nit picky. If you want great glove liners, look elsewhere, but if you just want warm gloves that are soft and comfortable, these are great.Lastly, before getting these gloves, I didn't think about wool and velcro on ski boots, jackets, etc... I feel like these gloves will not last as long because they will get stuck too my ski boot strap."
2,Fell apart after a couple wears,"I'm a huge fan of Smartwool socks. I've given and requested them as gifts, and I've recommended them to friends countless times. So a couple years ago, when I was in need of some liner gloves to wear under my shell gloves while snowboarding, I decided to see if Smartwool gloves were on the same level as their socks.My first impression when I wore them on the mountain was that they were comfortable, just like the socks, and they definitely helped keep my fingers warm. But then, after my second or third use, I noticed holes forming near the inner knuckle areas of the gloves. It wasn't long before the holes were big enough to fit my fingers through. I couldn't believe it! How could a company that puts so much care into their socks make such a poor-quality pair of gloves?I suppose it could have been a fluke, but the speed at which these gloves fell apart scared me off of purchasing anything else from Smartwool beyond their socks."
4,Keeps your hands warm but...,"These liners worked well at keeping my hands warm when I was skiing in Canada and the temp was -30. Wool insulates when wet so no problem there. My only complaint is that these liners LOVE velcro but I like the fact that they are soft. A trade off I imagine. Every time my hand got close to the ""hook"" velcro on my ski pants the threads would pull. I've used them quite a bit and there are no holes yet but it still bothers me."
5,wonderful purchase- would recommend to other hiking,very good quality--would recommend to anyone who hikes or likes the outdoors. i think fewer words should be required! one
4,"small, grey and quiet-- perfection","This ""best-of"" of the wonderful Galaxie 500 does them more than justice by wisely pulling off all of the high points from their three albums. the alternate version of ""Blue Thunder"" is especially affecting, what with the addition of devastating saxophone-- the broken-apart climax that Galaxie 500 always hinted around without ever tipping over that edge. Blue Thunder is worth your hard-earned money as it is. The somber ""Flowers"" follows, giving you that feeling of watching someone you're totally enamored with live their life apart from you-- all in the snow, of course. Other high points include the cover of Yoko Ono's ""Listen..."" and ""Another Day,"" their best song, in my opinion, shich again nearly breaks down with it's trying-to-keep-it-together vocal harmonies. I get misty-eyed just thinking about it. ""Tugboat"" ends this set, centering around the line ""there's a place I'd like to be."" Thanks to Dean and crew, we're there with him."
2,Very unremarkable,I think Galaxie 500 -- at least on this CD -- think they're Yo La Tengo. Except Yo La Tengo are good and Galaxie 500 are mediocre.
4,"Dishes of France: a Pleasure for the Palate, a Pleasure for the Eyes Too.","Interesting and genuine recipes from France. Interesting peripheral texts that give context (reminding us that food is part of culture at large). Illustrations by Sudre, a master French photographer. How many books have combined all these so far?That's why this book is a must see."
4,Worth having,"Picture and sound here is not the best. Bought for Albert Collins. I recorded Mack and Buchanan off Nightflight in 1985, Collins was a performance of If Trouble Was Money that does NOT appear on this DVD. Looks to me like it comes from CBS Sunday Morning.I never liked the cold feel of this video, the lighting never changes. Collins is good enough. The picture is very dark when he wanders into the audience.My favorite A.C.

3,"Cute, but ice block is too small for baby sister","We recently purchased this for my 5 year old son. He too likes how the crane is magnetic and can ""pull"" the ice block out of the carrier car. However, my complaint along with another reviewer is that the ice block on this car as well as the two red aquarium cars we purchased at target are definite choking hazards for younger children (I didn't realize they were removable before purchasing them). I'd rather not have to keep track of them so baby doesn't choke."
4,Would get 5 stars but shipping is too expensive.,This cheese has great flavor with low calories. It is pricey but worth is for what it adds to the meal. I found this cheese by a different brand at publix for the same price. Considering I just had to pay tax with no supping I think that is the better deal. I you don't live near a place where this cheese is sold then this may be your only choice. I will say that the shipping also included a frozen bag to keep the cheese cold during shipping. The bag had completely thawed when it reached me however.
3,patience needed,"I was really looking forward to listening this record. I'd never had anything from RHP before and I looking at the reviews I thought I found a new favorite. Well, actually it turned out a bit too arty for my taste. There are songs that are way too long on this album, they sometimes become a bit too repetitious. The voice of Kozelek is fine, though. Sounds like Duncan Sheik a bit - some of the songs even resemble Sheik's ""ballads"" musically. But, on the whole, if you consider that ""Ocean Beach"" consists only of slow songs (that must be a trademark of the band), they're simply not that heavenly breathtaking. Experimental, creative music, but I think one that's hard to really adore."
2,Excellent!.....When it works that is!..:(,"When I got this Flashlight, it worked like a hot dang. Nice and bright, well shaped light with no visible artifacts. It's also light weight and the grip and button position are well comfortable and well placed.Now the gripes:1. As an aircraft technician, I really need a dependable light, as my job depends on it at night during inspections. I give it a 1 for dependability, cuz it's pissed me off more that it's help me out!2. It's advertised as 6 hours continuous brightness. Well mine never lasted over 2 hours and after 2 hours in starts to act up gets a little dim and then stars blinking and..Dead!!! Pissed off again!I've used the batteries at work and bought energizers, with the same negative results..3. It is now total dead..Maybe I got a lemon, but this review reflects on that and QC of this item. Will send it out for warranty claim. Yay!"
2,"Great looking, but waste of money","I bought these in black, thought they looked fabulous on! They weren't too comfortable, although I've had MUCH worse. But, while walking on cobblestones, my foot turned slightly sideways, the sandal had no give whatsoever and the toe part broke. I had to throw them in the trash."
5,Best Alt-country band out there,"These guy's are making California Alt-country, and if you don't know what that sounds like, I strongly suggest that you check them out. With three discs to their credit, and all of them being great, they're starting to make one hell of a name for themselves. They're the buzz in that state, and it won't be long before their sound branches out to the masses. Of course, being an honest roots band doesn't get you major record deals these days, but it's nice to know there's still some great outfits like this keeping the real ""no depression"" folks happy. Highly recomended. Get all their music at www.cdbaby.com. Also check out these groups: Wrinkled Neck Mules, and Bucksworth (the best roots rock outfit there is today),very impressive young groups that are keeping honest music alive."
4,Enjoyable,"I remember that when this show first came out, all my friends and I would watch it. me not all the time, cause I didnt have cable, but my friends would tell me about it. One of my best friends, (her name is Mariana!) was givenboth Cd's, Mariana and Silvana, and I learned most of the songs. We even entered the contest that was going on! We were supposed to film us dancing with her songs and whoever won, got to be on the series! In the end though, I didnt enter. But anyways, the songs are enjoyable! still know them, (Tu eres mi angel, que estas en el cielo, las cosas se han vuelto, de otro color, fue tu mirada, que me hipnotza, me ensena que existe, de nuevo el amor!), there not like really cool pop or rock songs or anything like that, but you cant get it out of your head good type. Me and a friend, both american, we made the english version of ""superstar"", I forgot that one though, and Mariana and another best friend made a dance to go with it! It was tons of fun."
5,"Smooth, Quiet, Stable. Great Product","This elliptical is as smooth, if not smoother than the ones at my gym. It's so compact and takes so little room that it can be put infront of the TV while still delivering a very long stride length and arm movement. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone."
4,So far-So Good!!!,The sensor looks like the original and fit perfectly. I just installed it so time will tell about it's durability.
2,Hummingbird PiranhaMax 240 Fish Finder,"Easy to install. Below average documentation clarity. Display difficult to read in any sun, especially settings. Audio not very loud so have never heard fish notification but depth alarm is audible. Left over winter on boat out of any rain but fogged up badly. Fog cleared after a few months."
1,"Bought it in Dec 06, clip swivel joint popped off in Feb 07","Bought it in Dec 06 at the mall. Unfortunately paid like ten bucks.I used to carry it on my belt. Recently the swivel joint popped off when I was getting out of my car, and I don't even have a pot belly.If you can afford $4 per two months of usage, get it. If not, pouch is probably better."
4,Commercial Medicine Music : not pure,"I like this music. It is inspired by medicine music from Mali, the language is African, but I really can feel that the music is not purely African. Diallo has preferred commercial success among whites, that's why there is some white influence in his music, though to a much lesser extent that many African bands I am ashamed of. Diallo is on the good path, but that's not quite it. To my African brothers, I can recommend a purer healing music Kundidzora Azim's Mbira: Healing Music of Zimbabwe. That's the real stuff you want to get."
3,Legal Forms,Comprensive and a good resource on many forms. I used this to make the Wills for my husband and I. I recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to type out every word needed in usual forms.
2,Not much help,This product was a CD only. I expected to receive a booklet or even a guide on how to use it. I did not find it very helpful. I hope you will be able to understand it and use it more than I did.
2,Cheap plastic ruins this product,"I bought this after seeing a similar product being used on a cooking show. It does fine with garlic or nuts, but not too well with onions. The problem I have with it is it just feels CHEAP. The plastic is thin and brittle. I ended up buying a smaller version made by OXO that is much better quality. And it also has a plunger that locks down for storage."
2,cute but not functional!!,"this device is so cute. i love the pink color. it matches everything in my kitchen, because my kitchen is pink. the piece that separates the blade from the food does not stay on very well. the blades are DIFFICULT to clean. i make guacamole in mine and i have to take a butter knife to get in there and clean all of the avocado out."
2,Food Chopper does not work well,I read the reviews when I purchased this product and people liked it. I think it is a marginal product at best. You have to cut everything into small pieces before you put the food in. If I was going to go ahead and cut the food up that small I may as well just chop it myself.
2,Fragile,"This lasted a few days, but the bottom ""support"" piece came off its hinge after that. Until then, it was okay. The bottom support was also small, which meant heavy drinks seemed like they might break it.I did like the folding concept; it meant it was out of my way when I wasn't using it."
2,Country Music sounding,"Not their best work. Vocals are way out front, and the tunes sound like your average country band. Last tune on CD resembles the old MT sound with Toy playing more solo guitar."
4,A Gallery Of Outlaw Grizzlies,"""A Gallery Of Outlaw Grizzlies"" by W.P. Hubbard (pages 160-208) is the most interesting chapter in this book that highlights historical grizzly bears of the late 1800s to the early 1900s killing large numbers of cattle and sheep of pioneer ranchers for spans of years; these bears showed surprising intelligence in observing, evading, and attacking pursuing human hunters; the bears were killed in tremendously violent and dramatic encounters sometimes by people who were actually not actively hunting the bears and were doing other activities. The various chapters describe early historical experiences with grizzly bears, bear attacks on people throughout history, hunters' views-experiences, the bears' surprising activity at night, and the view that the plains grizzly bear of the distant past was larger from the abundance of buffalo meat and shorter hibernation periods than the modern grizzly bear."
1,Synapse Services (The company that handles your scubscription) SUCKS!,"Amazon, apparently, contracts out these subscription services to Synapse, Inc. I ordered Mix and Recording Magazine for my husband for XMAS on DEC.5th. We have never received EITHER magazine. When I called to inquire, I was told that it it would be 4 BUSINESS DAYS before I would be contacted by a customer service representative who could help me with my problem.I do not recommend anyone subscribe to any magazine through Amazon that is handled by Synapse,Inc. The only reason I gave them 1 star is because I the rating system would not allow me to give them ZERO."
1,Never Received - Never Notified,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift and the recipient told me last week that he never received it. I was told the publisher cancelled the order, but have yet to find out why and the issue is not resolved.I'm sure the magazine is good - but I can only know that if it were shipped. VERY FRUSTRATING!!"
4,Solid Blue Note Debut,"This album shows that Grant Green came roaring out of the gate a fully-formed talent; he already sounds amazingly self-assured considering this is one of his earliest recordings. If you're a fan of Green's straight-ahead Blue Note dates, get this."
4,Book True To Its Title,I thoroughly enjoyed Greg Laurie's analysis of Biblical figures who won and lost in their respective spiritual races. This book not only speaks of well known characters in the Bible but offers the reader solid insights into how we can learn from their experiences and apply those lessons on our own journeys.
2,"Doesn't ""clean"" the air","I had high hopes for this little unit, but was disappointed after using it for months in my bedroom. I give it two stars because it's fairly quiet and compact. However, I could literally see it blowing dust out with the ""clean"" air. I didn't notice any difference in the air quality or amount of dust in my room. I would not recommend this air purifier to anyone."
1,forget about it,"This product is a filthy mess, I just tossed mine in the trash today. And buyer beware, Bionire is a Holmes product."
4,No complaints here.,"After returning my Honeywell hht-081 purifier because it was louder than living next to the airport, I'm very pleased with this one.It's exactly what I needed... a quiet opeating, effective, small air purifier. It's not going to get your whole home fresh, and it says so on the box, so don't buy it in place of a larger purifier if that's what you need.It WILL reduce allergens in the home, but works best in smaller rooms (i.e. 11' x 10')Regarding filter replacement... People, get over it. That's how any (good) purifier works. The ones with ""permanent"" filters that you're supposed to vaccum... Yeah, a vaccum is going to get it good as new every time, isn't it? *shakes head* You just have to take into consideration that in order to operate this you will have to buy and replace the filter on occasion. Just like when you buy a car, you have to buy gas to make it work."
4,Good but could be better,"I put this in the bathroom as a test and noticed there is never any odor.However, the sucking power on the unit doesn't appear to be very strong. If you put your fingers in front of the intake, you'll probably think it's not even working. (although it will show you it's working if you put a small piece of paper such as a receipt in front of it)Also, remember this is not true HEPA. It gets 99% of airborne particles, whereas HEPA gets 99.97%. So, if you have 10,000 particles, this will miss 100 of them. True HEPA will only miss 3. I don't know if it matters that much, but, if I was rich, I would probably get a true HEPA with better suction.For someone on a budget though, this is probably a good starter unit."
3,"Cleans, but too bad not itself as well..","It's affordable, does what it's supposed to (clean the air) but in the process gets itself filthy. It's almost impossible to clean, so unless you don't care about having a dirty appliance in the middle of your room all the time, I would suggest finding an easier to clean model. Also, the filter seems to get glogged up pretty fast.. maybe I just live in super dusty conditions or something, but plan on spending just as much on filters every 3-6 months as on the unit itself."
2,Just... no.,"I don't know what it is, but this air purifier just doesn't seem to work worth beans. I've got another, slightly older Holmes purifier (HAP-240) that for some reason seems to work a lot better, although significantly louder. With this one, the air goes through the filter and comes out the other end as designed, but you just don't get a sense of cleaner air in the room -- there's almost zero odor removal. The filter appears to fit tightly, so it just doesn't make much sense. Could be this model uses a different, less effective filter than the aforementioned model.Either way, I don't recommend this product at all -- despite the fact that it runs very quietly on its lower settings -- it just doesn't really do what it was designed to do. Very disappointed."
5,Great Little Air Purifier,"I just bought another HAP242-UC to replace one I had for eight years. I run it in my bedroom while I sleep to cut down on the pet dander and fur in the air (I own a cat and Border Collie), and to cover any residual sound from my apartment building neighbors. It works great. The noise level for the low setting is about what a small table fan would be. Yes, the filters are a bit expensive, but I only have to change it every three months or so."
5,Indispensable for anyone suffering from RSI,"This is the book I return to again and again, since the exercises, which are gentle and easy to do, really do help on tense and injured muscles and tissue. The book is very much focused on the drawings of the exercises with helpful text on the sides and references to important intro text scattered throughout to help you remember the essentials of safe stretching. Very easy to use book, and the exercies do help! If you need more information in general about RSI, the physiology of it and treatments, I have found ""It is not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!"" to be a very informative book."
5,Painless bass player,"When I was first diagnosed with Carpal tunnel, I thought that my future in playing bass was over. I was in constant pain that even the strongest of painkillers could not abate. After learning about ""the stretch point"" and doing the exercises from this book, all my pain was eliminated. Now as soon as I regain strength, I'll be back on bass. This book not only offered relief, it gave me hope, and a cure!"
4,Worked for me,"I wouldn't have bought this book if I had had a chance to look at it, since it uses words like ""bodywork"", which turn my stomach, and has a somewhat new-age-y tone which repels my mind. But as it turns out, I bought it sight unseen from Amazon, and thought I'd try it out. I had started experiencing RSI symptoms about a month earlier. One evening I picked up the Butler book and did a few of the exercises. The next morning I woke up without pain in my forearms for the first time in several weeks. I still have some symptoms which these exercsises have not (yet?) alleviated, but it's definitely alleviated some, and perhaps prevented others from getting worse. The exercises are easy and non-stressful (physically or mentally). Even I -- who ordinarily hate physical exercise of any kind -- enjoy them.END"
2,Caused more pain,"The good: The exercises are categorized and easy to understand. The exercises probably are effective for most people.The bad: Following the exercises precisely for three weeks, I felt much more numbness and weakness. For some, these stretches may actually exacerbate the problem.Beware, and begin slowly. If you are one who finds benefit, then gradually increase the number of stretches and the time you spend stretching. If, however, your symptons increase, slow down or stop.Good luck!"
4,A helpful book for anyone with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,"I ordered this book for my wife, who has had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) in her right wrist for some time. It recently got worse after she fell off her bike and broke a couple of bones in the same wrist. The bones have healed, but the accident somehow increased the CTS symptoms: tingling sensations, numbness and a general increase in CTS aggravation. She has found this book, Conquering CTS, informative and helpful. After reading it and doing the excercises, for about a month now, she has found that not all the exercises suit her particular condition. So, she has, through trial and error, found which excercises in the book are helpful. They work, and help relieve the sypmtoms. So, I would recommend this book to anyone who has CTS. It is not a cure-all, in my wife's case, but it has made a difference. I would buy it, read it, try the exercises and find which ones work best for you."
4,Practical Self-Help Guide,When I complained to my doctor about numbness in my fingers while sleeping and after hard handyman work he slapped a wrist strap on me. He said it sounded like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome so try to ware the strap as much as possible. The strap worked but what a pain in its own right.This book - my first one on this topic - simple explained what this is all about and more importantly what we can do about it WAY before surgery. Its main contribution is an extensive list of pain management stretching exercises (complete with diagrams) that are at the heart of this practical self-help guide. I have skipped wearing the wrist strap.
5,stretchin 10 yrs of hard work out my arms,"Simple, well laid out book.I am doing the stretches daily for 2 weeks now. I feel changes already..Also i have become more aware of how tight i am. Great book!"
5,A Good Book,"I live in Brazil and experienced for about 5 months pain im my right forearm, wrist and hand. In just 15 days doing these exercices I got free from these aches. Now I'm doing these stretches as prevention and recommend this book for every one who uses computers daily."
3,Not that great,"I was not as impressed with this video. It's a little weird, seems a bit ""low-budget."" My 4 year old liked it though, my 11 month old didn't seem intrested for very long--which is expected at that age. I guess I'm just more of a fan of Baby Einstein videos."
4,Quiero Ser Libre,"Excelent book for self help. good spanish , easy to read and great suggestions by the author"
4,Esclarecedor,"Yo tengo este libro y lo uso actualmente en un grupo de terapia para la recuperacion de la codependencia, es muy esclarecedor y enseña mucho a través de las actividades que nos plantea, no es fácil si se hace a consciencia, pero el beneficio es para toda la vida nuestra y de nuestra familia"
1,Waste of Time,"The book is a unique American product where scientists and theologists work together to write extensive techinical material to confuse and impress people misdirecting them in science. One author is a scientist and the other is a theologist. It is a bizarre output that is, in literary terms, may be described as a very well-written book. But as far as the content goes it is a shame that somebody would be expected to spend so much time reading this heavy book to be convinced about a place for intelligent design in science."
4,Interesting Ideas,"I am about 100 pages into this book and am enjoying it. The ideas are interesting and thought provoking. There is a great deal of evidence provided.At times it is abit challenging for someone without a science background but it is, overall, accesible for most.Certainly a convincing argument so far."
5,I've taught college astronomy 11 years: thumbs up for book,"The Privileged Planet is a major contribution to science. Surprisingly, it reads like a mystery novel. You keep running into evidence for design in unexpected places. The average educated reader will find this book very accessible. It's hard to put the book down for two reasons: 1. It captivates interest by calling attention to how our place and time in the cosmos sets us up for the thrills of life and productive scientific inquiry. 2. It's arguments are based on widely accepted evidence found in leading scientific journals."
5,Revolutionary Book on Science,"There are many books about science that examine scientific revolutions. This book is going to begin one. Simply put, this is the most exciting book about science that I've read in years, and in regard to the literature about anthropism in the universe, it is certainly THE most important book since Barrow and Tipler's ""Anthropic Cosmological Principle."" Even more important, those who argue that the Intelligent Design Movement cannot advance science, are going to have to eat ""cosmological crow."" Quite clearly, the co-author astronomer and physicist Guillermo Gonzalez amply demonstrates that the Privileged Planet approach to scientific research yields a nearly endless abundance of discovery."
5,The Privileged Planet,"This is one of the simplest and most informative pieces of information I've come across. It is information everyone can benefit from, by having it as general knowledge, since it gives a real sense of our place and purpose."
5,The Marvels of Earth,"This is a book that would appeal to anyone who is curious about where the earth and the people on it fit into the universal scheme. It uses the most sophisticated scientific approaches to outline how our planet is truly unique. It is highly readable, in spite of the challenging scientific language and theories. From the floor of the deepest ocean to the most distant of stars, the miracle that is the Earth is spread out for the reader's enjoyment. I highly recommend this book to space and science buffs and anyone who would appreciate a fresh approach to the Intelligent Design debate."
2,It's God of the Gaps Again,"This work is a good overview of the science of astrobiology but not as good as Rare Earth. However, it draws its conclusion that the mystery of 'why we are here' is just a subtle reiteration of the 'God of the Gaps'.""The Devil made me do it"" -- Flip Wilson."
1,BIASED,".. there's not much more to say about this book except that it's biased and doesn't account for most of the proven science that exists. Not that Guillermo will care if it's biased, even though he claims to be a neutral scientist.Assuming that there's an intelligent design because we don't understand, fully, how our world works should remind you of many assumptions we humans have made in the last thousand years. The universe doesn't revolve around the Earth, nor is the world flat, with edges."
1,I don't get it,"How does a studied understanding of the universe given us by cosmologists deny the possibility of god's hand behind it all? Why wouldn't god use the tools of the universe he created in its origin and outcome? In short, why the need to create from no evidence something as execrable as this book? Read the Elegant Universe by Brian Greene if you want to see our latest understanding of god's handiwork."
4,A Better Reference Than A Reader,"I really appreciated the work & thought that went into this book. I was already a proponent of intelligent design & actually got boored by the extensive examples of cosmological features that suggest design. Someone new to the subject & open-minded might find it far more interesting. The issue itself has eternal consequences & is therefore inherently interesting.I was impressed that these fellows are capable philosophers of science & did well in their presentation of their argument as well as responding to criticisms. My main challenge for the intelligent design camp is to focus it's excellent critical examination skills upon the assumptions that undergird mainstream dating methods for the earth & cosmos. This is a weak link for them, which has been pricked by authos such as Kenneth R. Miller in Finding Darwin's God."
4,Entertaining Filth,"Typical Joan Rivers rudeness. It starts out with some vulgar humor, but gets repetitive after a while. There's a limit to how many jokes you can make about a girl who has sex with every guy on the basketball team."
4,Lexicon - The Lessons,"Sexy discotheque-house from Lexicon on their first album, THE LESSONS. Right away, ""Funk Corner"" gets you swaying to some sweet piano-line grooves and some nice Hammond organ punches, while ""Superstar"" has a more solid kick drum. Lots of dancefloor fodder here -- the good kind, too. The steady beat of ""Phrunky"" gives way to a wiggly acid-funk line; ""The Question"" and ""The Ryker"" are much more percussively aggressive. But ""Summer Madness"" gets us back into the sunshine shining on the block party. ""Placenta"" and ""Kolt Sivers"" is the smooth tech-house that Plastic City has become famous for. The final track, ""Jazz Field,"" moves into more downtempo territory; these boys are more than one-trick ponies. Take these lessons home!"
4,I Am Planning On Buying One Of These,"I am planning on buying one of these AM transmitter kits for my personal experimentation and broadcasting. I used to use the ""kids"" lab kit called the 200 In One lab kit for AM broadcasting, but now I am growing out of it. So now I am going to place a order for one of these kits. The downfall that is really making a little disappointed is not the performance or how it sounds it's the way Ramsey sells this kit WITHOUT the power supply, but includes the case. Another thing that it's not a portable type the way it's designed, so when I get it I have add a 9 volt battery to it, and hope that would help power it up. If you are going to get this kit, make sure that Ramsey Electronics sells you the power supply or have them that it does a dual power supply such as 9 volt battery, D cells, AA batteries, or solar power. I am going to bring this up in the forum. More from this soon after I buy it."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"Day 1, I was pleased with the product until I saw it shedding everywhere. By day 5, most of my floor was covered in tufts from the kitty condo. The staples started coming out from inside and I would have to inspect daily so that my cat wouldn't die from ingesting staples. Three weeks later, the top started falling, and now the kitty condo has no top. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who cares about their pet."
5,Cats are happy,"This is small so be sure to look at the measurements. When we first opened the box, we thought we made a mistake because it was smaller than we aniticpated. We have 2 average size cats. They love it! You know how cats try to squeeze into boxes that are too small for them? Same results here. They've figured out how to fit their bodies into the bottom and swat at one of the dogs when they get near (fun play) and other times lay on the top level with parts of them dangling over.If the cats are happy, then we are happy."
2,cheaply made,the top of the condo is held by two staples. also it has lots of strings comming loose from the carpet. and ass you know that cats tend to play with strings and swallow them and get sick with vomiting and diareah. worst case they would need surgery. do not reccomend any string carpeted products for cats.
5,Great buy and great product.,Excellent product. Would buy it again. It arrived on time and was not spoiled. It was new and packaged correctly and I'd buy it again.
1,Beware!,"Purchased this DVD, does not work on any of my DVD players. It will work on my computer but that is it. So much for enjoying it with my sound system."
3,Lara Fabian,"I'm sure the content of the dvd is great, however I didn't get to enjoy it because it didn't work on all three of my dvd players. I can't give it more than 2 stars for now."
1,Probably great if you don't live in the U.S.,"Unfortunately, this DVD is not compatible with U.S. market DVD players. It's encoded for Europe, so you're going to have to return it. I still like Lara Fabian, but this DVD isn't good for much except spending money on return postage."
1,Bad product,"Supposedly a working DVD. But it does nottingham play on any of 3 DVD players I have tried. If I can't play it, I can't write about it."
1,Lara Fabian DVD N/G,"I was very unhappy with this product as it is a DVD that will not play on a US player; no mention of this can be found anywhere on your website, and Amazon charged me the shipping charge to return it claiming it was not Amazon's fault. I'd like to know who's fault it is. I ended up paying for it!!!!"
3,Lack of Care in keeping track of orders.,"I'd bought the DVD back in January 16th and by February 10th, I still had not received the DVD (which was the LAST day the package was supposed to arrive). Apparently the DVD had been back ordered and the seller never bothered to make sure that my package got sent out!I'll give them some credit because they answered my email about this matter, but they should have been more careful in the first place!"
4,Needed new rice cooker,"I went online and did some research as to what is one of the best rice cookers and found the Zojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup to have high ratings. Ordered through Amazon. Came to our house fairly rapidly. Box was in good shape. Not banged up. Cooked the rice. It was perfect. Easy to clean. Very Happy with unit. Although it did take a little longer to cook than our previous old cheap non-zojirushi model. It was expensive, but we use it at least 2-3 times a week, and if it lasts 10-years, that would be a lot of perfect rice over the years."
5,Family rice cooker,"I love this rice cooker, I use it for brown rice mostly but my son and my daughter will have white rice some times.This new rice cooker has easy instructions, there is one time I'm on vacation , I told my son how to use this rice cooker in general and he did an excellent job. He told me one day he made sushi, he followed instruction that I told him, the rice came out perfectly. I was very surprised, even my son did not know how to cook, and the result came out just as good as me."
4,would be 5 if not for the teflon coating,"I love this rice cooker. I would like to have two of them if not for the teflon coating. However, all the premium rice cookers seem to have teflon coating. sign..."
1,The non-stick coating started to peel after 3 years,"I am very disappointed to report that my once trusted brand is not as good as I thought. Obviously I didn't expect the inner pan of the cooker would start peeling especially a $300 Zojirushi Japanese made model. We never abuse the unit and always clean it with water and soft cloth after use and never use any metal or sharp object to touch the inner pan surface. There are a couple spots start peeling at the bottom of the pan as well as the edge of the measuring numbers on the sides. Unfortunately, it costs $100+ to get the replacement inner pan. My 10+ year Panasonic never had this problem.If you want to get some to late for a long time, stay away from this. If this is a $50 rice cooker, I would give it a 4 stars but a $300 Zojirushi failed after 3 years, 1 star is my rating."
2,Thought this was going awesome.,I am not impressed with this rice cooker... for as expensive as it is I wanted something that cooked my rice to perfection.. not mush. The quality is great it just doesn't do a great job of cooking rice. I should have returned it.
5,Wonderful rice cooker,"We held off buying a rice cooker for many years. But when the price came down on this one and after reading the reviews, we decided to splurge. Delicious! I'm still trying to figure out if we can make risotto in it. That would be even better."
2,rust on inside ring,the rice cooker cook fine but while cooking the steam come out ands goes all over the counter the inside ring is all rusted they sent me another one it also rusted
2,Not worth it,"Everything I own is the Zojirushi, even the coffee maker. However, this rice cooker is some what disappointed, they have very fancy name ""Induction Heating System"" and make sound like some ""Break through"" technology to cook better rice. The fact is that my old and much cheaper Zojirushi rice cooker made ""equal or better"" rice and much better sushi rice. Do not wise your money, just buy the cheaper modal."
1,inner shell came off and it's dead less than 3 years.,"I use it for a year and the pot's inner shell came off ( $100 to replace the pot). This morning, I tried to cook and received an error E 06 ( manual said circuit errors, try to use a different outlet, no luck). I called the company and they suggest sending it in for repair. This one is purchased Sep 2009.Made in Japan and quality is like Made in China. I will never buy from this company again.I am Asian and we eat rice every day. I am going back to Tiger."
5,Top of the line,"I am a rice eater all my life. As any serious rice eater would know, the best rice come from slow cooking in a thick pot over flame. You will not get that with any electric rice cooker, not even this one.I have used lots of nice rice cookers in my life. This one is very good. Like any good rice cooker, it keep your rice warm and moist for a couple of days. Try all settings, soft, hard, medium to see what fit your taste. It is very good, but a good one from Panasonic or Sanyo will be more budget-friendly, only slightly inferior. Buy this if you absolutely have to have the best."
1,The coating has terrible smell after one year of use,"The rice has terrible fishy smell after using ""keep warm"" function for 24-hour.Original, we thought it was the sealing issue.Later, we figured out that it came form the inner pan coating.Even without anything inside the pot, it smells after closing for a day.To avoid the harmful stuff the coating desorbs, we decide to throw it away and change to a stainless pan cooker.Don't buy the cooker with the coating pan for the sake for your health!"
5,Love it!!! The best.,"I'll be honest, I have a culinary degree and I suck at making rice perfectly. This machine has changed my life. I make rice at least once a week and it is always perfect, you can't screw it up. We've braoden our horizons since this purchase to try different varities of rice. Definitely reccommend."
5,My rice never tasted this good.,I am utterly impressed by this rice cooker and the Japanese technology. White rice made by this rice cooker freezes very well. Also it cooks brown rice soft and moist.
5,My first electric rice cooker,"Now keep in mind this is my first electric rice cooker so my only comparison is a microwave rice cooker and the stove top, but here's my personal experience.I've had this rice cooker for less than a week and I'm in love! It cooks brown rice better than I've ever been able to on the stove top, and it also makes perfect sushi rice. Cleaning it is so easy, the inner lid, inner bowl, and steam vent on top all come out and can be washed. As for some of the reviews about the inner bowl/pot teflon coating peeling off I haven't had mine long enough to know if it happens however, I'm fairly sure that using silicon utensils will make it so that isn't a problem.The only con I can find about this product is that its pretty pricey, and if you don't eat rice everyday you can more than likely get by with a much less expensive cooker."
5,Amazing,"I have tried steel cut oats, jasmine rice, sprouted rice, and used the GABA setting to sprout my own brown rice. Everything has been perfect. It couldn't be easier. Measure, set it, and forget it. I cannot wait to get the Bread Machine!"
4,Very Good Brit Mystery,"Murder in the Bath is a very good Brit Mystery. It takes place, of course, in the English city of Bath at around the end of the 19th century - beginning of the 20th century. The protaganist is none other then Amelia Watson, second wife of Doctor John Watson, chronicler and friend of Sherlock Holmes. Amelia is asked by an old friend to travel to Bath and help her husband who has been arrested for murder. Amelia is a good detective as she starts to unravel and solve the mystery with only a small assist by her husband, John Watson. You kind of, sort of, guess who the murderer really is but you'll end up reading the whole book just because you could be wrong! Amelia is a good, strong character who holds her own against many tough male characters. A good and enjoyable read."
3,Print & Plush Bean Bag review....,"Not the best bean bag compared to some of the others for the same price. There is not enough stuffing in it. You might end up refilling some more soon enough. The foam-filled ones are lot better than this kind. This type is good enough for kids to use if that's the goal, but not for adult use. I have the foam-filled ones as well, and they are nice because they rebound to shape soon enough and are more comfortable."
2,too small,not large enough for an adult and just not that comfortable to sit on. i didn't like the material either. currently trying to return it...
5,I Love It!,"Our entire family loves this. It smelled bad at first but I let it ""off gas"" outside for 3 days and the smell dissipated. It is more red than burgundy. I got it on my birthday."
1,We didn't like it.,We didn't like it. It wasn't comfortable. It was too small to give the back any support. We sent it back.
3,Didn't last that long,"The bean bag was bulky and comfortable in the beginning, but after 3-4 weeks, the beans started loosing shape.. it wasn't that bulky anymore.. the bag is great, but the beans aren't. I am thinking of buying a refill in some time.. although I think that the refilling of this bag is going to cost me much more than I anticipated.."
2,disappointed,"Your one star rating I do not like the word hate you used.A better choice of word should be used for a business.Your marketing or sales department should change this.As far as the bean bag purchase I was highly disappointed in this item.First of all it was shipped in wraped plastic which I thought was not very appealing.Secondly,the item itself was cheaply made and way over priced.I did not like anything about it the bag.I did not even like the way it was made."
5,Great story of life's lessons for any boy,"I am reading this story to my 7 y.o. son. Each night we read 2 chapters and he is totally enthralled. The story works through many typical boy situations: bullies, not being the best at sports, etc. I think it is an important story for any young boy, but it is also an exciting adventure written so that each chapter ends with something to entice you to read more."
1,A shocker,"This is a terrible book. The civil war on Outreach between the factions of Wolf's Dragoons should have been thrilling. Instead, Charette made it boring. The characters were one-dimensional, and their actions frequently inexplicable. The plot was full of cliches, and many threads were never resolved. The source of conflict was obscure. The writing style was never any better than pedestrian. You needed a full history of Wolf's Dragoons (which I don't have access to) to make sense of a lot of the story. Even the illustrations were bad.Frankly, ""Field Manual: Mercenaries"" is a more enjoyable read about Wolf's Dragoons, and that's not the way it should be."
5,Great 3 year old's book.,"I saw these reviews when I logged on to purchase a new copy of this great book. This is certainly one of the best books in the toddler's picture-book genre. My 3 year old son has loved this book since he was 2. My experience is similar to other reviewers. My son has memorized every picture and word of text in the book, and recites the detailed text verbatim, and wants to review the book with me cover to cover almost every night. I now know more about road-building heavy equipment than I ever cared to know."
5,So good that we're on our second book!,"My now 2-year old son was 17 months when he first spotted this book at a garage sale. It turned out to be quite possibly the best $1.50 ever spent on him. Over the past six months he has memorized all of the vehicles as well as managed to rip out out 75% of the book. Not that he seems to care -- though the majority of pictures were ripped out, it remained his favorite book. I finally bought him another book, a new one, to start fresh. Worth every penny."
1,Handmade handle?,"Since when is taking something out of an injectionmold, ""handmade""? The whole thing is light weight,hollow plastic. Can't weight more than an ounce.Not going to last more than a few months.I would not have paid $5.00 muchless $20 if I had seen it in person first.This is my first bad internet experience.Do not buy one of these."
5,A Tour Without Force,"When No One's watching is an album that sings soulfully of many of life's common experiences -- with warm lyrics poetically spanning the highs and lows of childhood through romance -- thoughtful and sensitive , rythmic and whimsical."
