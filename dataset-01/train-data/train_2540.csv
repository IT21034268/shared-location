3,This week and the next!,"I give this album 3.5 stars. Jean grae is the best female emcee in the game. Shen shows her lyrical muscle on every song on this album. That cannot be denied. Her hunger is the beast awaiting you every time you put this cd in the car, that cannot be denied. Her features and beats on the other hand need some work. She got maybe 5 real tight beats, thanks to Belief, 9th wonder, and Midi Mafia. If it weren't for these songs the album would be a total failure. But its not to say that the album has five good songs. If you can block out some of the awful beats and listen to Jean, you are in for a treat. Hey this is my opinion, I'd buy this cd just for the lyrics and flow, which is kinda awkward and offbeat, but it works and blends wonderfully everytime."
2,Good days & Bad days [2 & half stars],"There are some good songs on here - there are also quite a few mediocre ones. There is some sex and a little violence in the lyrics, but she is far more intellectual and creative than the standard raptress getting play on BET or MTV (not that female MCs are anything other than a rarity). Most of the songs are mid-tempo, nothing really hype, danceable, or club-ready.There are 13 songs on this CD (Tracks 3 & 11 are skits; there are also skits added on tracks 4 and 14). The track listing and booklet do not correlate exactly to the track order on the disc. Lyrics not included."
3,This book is not for average students,"The information in this book is amazing, but do not expect your average student to grasp the material or even want to eagerly participate in the activities.Written for 5th grade and up, this book is dense with information for you to impart to your students. Most activities involve some sort of logic problem or writing with logic-based analysis. While noteworthy endeavors, the curricular direction does nothing to directly connect students with the material.I would keep this book generally for information for yourself to refer to. Otherwise, leave it to an accelerated/high interest program teacher. There is also no ability to allow students from a full inclusion program to participate with minimal accommodations."
3,"great, when it's in one piece!","I have to start off by saying the company does have good customer service- once I googled them to get the phone number. It's a good thing too, because I've called them several times- starting five minutes after opening the package to find that not all the pieces were in the box. They sent out new bases, fairly quickly, and without any hassle. The thing has broken numerous times, and I've always had an ok experience with the company, but it is very frustrating. The finished buttons are small, but are nicely done. My child makes her own artwork for them, and they really look cute. I wish it was a better made product, and that the company's information was more readily available. Thank goodness for their website."
1,Does not work,I bought this machine to make craft buttons for friends. The wheel consistently jams and none of the pieces stayed in place. I would have returned this right away if it were possible.
1,Horrible,"Overall, I'm pretty crafty and can figure just about anything out, but this was a complete piece of junk. My son was so excited, but never was able to make a single button. Dont even risk it. I wish I could return it."
3,Decent Product,"I've had the watch for about two years now, but then it would occasionally stop working. I got a new battery, it worked well for a couple weeks, but now it's stopped working for good."
3,Okay for small objects,"This car mount is installed very easily. I did it in less than 5 minutes, but I've had the center console apart before. Its cut to fit well and the trim snaps back in place with no modifications. You should be able to remove it later with no trace it was there. The downside of this mount is that it isn't particularly stable. Its just a relativity thin sheet of steel on one axis and likes to vibrate on that axis (near vertical.) This might not be a problem if you're mounting a small device holder close to the mount plate. However is a issue with larger objects. I have a RAM system with a 3.5"" arm attached to this plate and it likes to vibrate when the car is in motion. It doesn't make the GPS unusable or anything, but it does make fine text harder to read on the move. If you have a heavier device or particularly if you're using an arm mount I would think about getting a more secure mount plate."
1,Amateur,"For a movie made in 2010 I have no idea how they got the feel (and wardrobe) of a student film of the late 90s. It's all pretty bad. Acting, writing, directing. I couldn't even get to the action-filled parts of the movie."
1,0 STARS: It sucks,"Those who know the ""HorrorMan"" know how much I love horror movies, and while there is nothing I like to see more than some drug addict vegans being ripped to pieces as we see in ""Feeding Grounds"" here, there has to be a little atmosphere to make a horror movie work. There is no horror movie like atmosphere, no suspense (except for the nature of this creature that kills the people), and no style to this movie whatsoever. The script sucks, the acting sucks and the production values just are not there. It's hard to believe than anyone can take ""Feeding Grounds"" seriously, but to each his/her own. These neo-horror or new age horror movies have lost the generation that grew up watching classic horror movies. These movies have no heart and ""Feeding Grounds"" is no exception to the rule. It sucks."
5,An excellent way to discipline while minimizing the anger.,This is one of the best books I have read on child discipline. I read it while raising my children and put it to the test of practical day to day situations. It worked. For the most part the examples provided the desired response and reduced the stress of both parent and child. You can easily adapt it to your own family style.
4,Very helpfil,"bought this for a friend who was at the end of her rope with her child. She said this was easy to read, made sense and was helpful. She now uses logical consequences with him and he is improving all the time."
4,great value!,"I bought this for christmas and I must say I am quite impressed! light enough for easy handling, good image quality, a lot of features for the low, low price. LCD panel does drain the battery quite quickly but with the eyepiece (black and white...aaarrgghh) you can get almost 8 solid hours of filming in...more than enough...recommended for first or second camcorder owners..."
3,Camcorder provides good quality image with no frills...,"The TRV-16 provides good quality image with no frills to hike up the cost. I am not a video enthusiast, but will be travelling to Poland soon. Not wanting to invest a significant amount of money, the price is great. I find the LCD panel to be a battery drain, given the benefit it provides is not a necessity. Overall, the unit performs well for what it is, an entry-level camcorder. I bought one to take to Europe and feel that it will perform satisfactorily. Check again in Mid-August for an updated review."
4,Great camera but out of date,I have had this camcorder for a few years now and it is great. But battery life is short and the view finder is not convinient.but i want to upgrade.
2,Star Wars: Boba Fett #2: Crossfire,"Star Wars: Boba Fett #2: Crossfire, by Terry Bisson""Crossfire"" is the second book in a six book series on the life of young Boba Fett. Boba is now the guest, or prisoner, depending on how you look at it, of Count Dooku. When the starting war comes to Raxus Prime, Boba manages to escape the junkyard planet by pretending to be an orphan.While en route to a Bespin orphanage, Boba makes the first friend of his life. But when he's torn between his new friend and his father's teachings - which will he choose?""Crossfire"" was a bit blah to me, and even though it's a short book, it felt like it dragged on for too long. I think it could have been tightened up a little.2/5."
3,Good tape for your collection.,"LOCO BOY MAKES GOOD was an excellent short. I laughed at this short possibly more than any other. Possibly Curly's funniest short ever. One of my personal favorite shorts.MATRI-PHONY is another funny short. Vernon Dent is funny as the emperor. Curly in drag is funny as well. A great short.SAVED BY THE BELLE is not that funny. There are a few good scenes, but not enough of them.Still a good tape for your collection."
2,Loco boy makes good,"I didn't care much for this tape. Matri-phony was really the only one I liked. The other two didn't seem very funny. In Loco Boy Makes Good (1942, #60) The stooges help an old lady transform her hotel into a night club. Later on, Curly gets the magician's coat by mistake. In Matri-phony (1942,#63) Curly takes an innocent Girl's place at the altar. And finally in saved by the belle (1939,#40)The stooges are caught in the middle of a revolution. The only gag that I liked in this short is when Curly thought the hand grinade was a pineapple. It was alright, but I wouldn't reccomend it too much. I would rather see ""An ache in every stake"", or ""Disorder in the court""."
4,Three Solid Curlies,A good collection of fine stooges shorts. As usual when the boys do right good things happen and when they do wrong chaos enuses.My favorite of the lot is MATRI-PHONY (1942) which in my mind ranks with the best of their stuff. (which doesn't say much for my mind.)A very good choice for the new stooges fan and once again an old reliable one for us old timers with appearences of all the old backround crew.Basically the stooges shorts are a snapshot of vaudville which thanks to the magic of television will live forever. That alone makes them worth the money. Even better they are a very funny snapshot.
4,He liked them...,"I have a 10 year old, rescued, toy poodle and apparently his previous owners taught him to beg for people food. I do not feed dogs people food but I feel so bad when he sits in the floor and begs while we eat dinner at the table. So I bought these to give him when he begs. He also has tooth issues, so I needed them to be soft. He liked it and wanted more, but he seems to like another one (of the same brand) better that is chicken liver flavored. My only issue is I paid 8 dollarsish for these on amazon and found them the day before my delivery arrived at Petsmart for less than $5. Will be purchasing there from now on."
2,My dog did not flip over for Gooberlicious!,I first bought this because my puppy never had any peanut butter flavored treats and it was on sale at petsmart. I was expecting small pieces but the pieces from the 10 oz. pack were the size of a real peanut. He ate the first 4 to 5 pieces but afterward he ignored it entirely. He refuses to do tricks for this treat. For the longest time I had no idea why. I did some research on dog treats and food. What's healthy and what's not. I soon realized that this is made with Chicken By-Product Meal...which is a BIG NO NO.On top of that it doesn't smell good. Every time I touch it my hand it would reek of this treat. Not a pleasant experience for me and my puppy.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read some whatever flash fiction in a textbook that is used at a college level, one a friend is using in a course. I couldn't find that one on amazon.com, but did find this one. These are just truly not well written, and they really don't reflect what flash fiction is suppose to be. I couldn't read more than a dozen."
3,Too short shorts,"The eighty stories in Flash Fiction Forward, averaging two and a half pages in length, were fantastic, awesome, average, mediocre and awful. In four words - they were too short! New Sudden Fiction, with stories about twice as long, was a much better read and, instead of the sparse credits section contained in this volume (containing little beyond ""first published"" and copyright information), includes biographical information about each author."
3,Meh,"The book as a whole was kind of a let down, I would say about half of the book was good and half of the stories didn't belong there. I haven't read Thomas and Shapard's first collection of flash fiction (maybe they took all the good ones for that book); not saying I could write any better, but in a collection of stories that are suppose to be the cream of the crop, this anthology isn't it (maybe there's not a lot of flash fiction out there to choose from, so pickin's are slim). But that's only half of the stories.The other half of the stories were fantastic: each compelling in their own way, where the author expertly told a story that could be imagined with ease. Some of my favorites were: ""Baker's Helper"", ""Why You Shouldn't Have Gone In The First Place"", ""Words"", ""Parrot Talk"", ""The Wallet"", and ""What I Know Of Your Country"".Overall the book is okay. I'd recommend buying it, just because it's always good to read as much as you can; but I'd save your money and buy a used version."
4,Bite Sized Beauties,"You can read any of these 80 stories whenever you have a free few minutes. From the very first story I was hooked. I wondered whether some of them were ""short stories"" at all but rather poetry or some other form. But no matter, they were funny, sad, dark and light. Very enjoyable and recommended."
4,Gift,"This was a wish tree gift that seemed to be exactly what the child was looking for and I could not find it in any of our local stores. I had the opportunity to try it out in the box, which I was grateful for. I'm sure the 7 year old was delighted Christmas morning. Thank you Amazon for making this available to me and for getting it to me in a timely manner."
4,Great,This was a good first Remote Control. I know most children would enjoy the experience because it is so easy for them to use.
1,"No ""Turn"" option","This toy is great for noises...but thats about it. The remote doesn't give the option to steer the vehicle. It may be perfect for a 3-5 yr old, but not a day older. Very disappointed at the price point."
2,very loud and cheap.,I returned this truck because it was defected. It wouldn't go backwards. I bought another one and it works okay. It is very loud and it is kind of cheap. I don't expect it to last very long.
4,Great for the price,"I bought this for a 3 year old. He loved it, jumped up and down. It seems to be a fun toy, lots of buttons and sounds, can't beat the price!"
4,How much fun can you have at an auction?,"Jess Miller answers this question for you. There are many characters to keep track of and sometimes it may seem confusing. My favourite is the Arab Sheik and his son. The story is set in the little town of Little Saddlington, which I don't know it really exists. The town is drawn into chaos as the auction is the biggest ever, because of all the advertising. People from Australia, Japan, America all find it very interesting. The book made me laugh at all the weird things people do when put under abnormal circumstances. There is a lot of soul, heart and a really clincher at the end of the book. I can't wait for the next novel by my friend, Jess Miller!"
3,The Emphasis Is On Prevention,"The title is a bit of a misnomer since the text concentrates mostly on prevention and devotes less than ten pages to traditional cancer treatments plus only one chapter to alternative treatments.The main prevention topics include linseed oil, macrobiotic diet, visualization therapy, bee pollen, nutrition and foods to avoid.The glossary is brief and the list of resources very limited. I can only recommend this book as a general introduction to the subject of cancer prevention and treatment. The text is already somewhat dated in spite of its claim to be recently revised."
2,How to make money selling old books.,"This book has a wealth of dietary information that will PREVENT cancer in the first place. There are cancer treatments in this book that WILL work. Drugs, radiation and surgery are NOT necessary to cure cancer. Give this book a try before you let some quack doctor pump you full of radioactive nuclear waste!"
4,How to fight Cancer and win,I bought this book for a friend who has prostrate cancer for the chapter on Dr. Johanna Budwig's diet. It helped an 80 year friend of mine who was diagnosed with prostate cancer live to be 97 years old.
2,Too Small,"The quality of this product is fine; however, no where is there a description of the length of each leash. It is made for micro dogs. It is even too small for our chihuahua mix and terrier to use."
2,"really tiny, small, not as big as you might think...","I'm not sure what kind of animal this is meant to tether together, gerbils, perhaps? It's extremely short, and I can't see it being used. It says 14"" - 18"" long, well that's simply inaccurate. It is perhaps 7"" long with two leads, giving a total extension of 14"" when not actually in use. A real disappointment."
3,"Pennington, 24 years on.....","I too read the Pennington trilogy many years ago at school. I have recently chased them up again after 24 years and have once again enjoyed them immensly. (...) The relationship that evolves between Pat and Ruth is dealt with wonderful understanding on K M Peyton's part. Patrick Pennington's handling of his talents and the traumas of youth are masterfully portrayed and I have every intention of giving these books to my daughter to read. How I wish they were back in schools, as though times have changed, the angst of growing up has not altered very much at all, and triumph of spirit is timeless after all!"
1,Very dissapointed,The product is very cheaply made and with the slightest pressure bends all out of shape. I would not recommend purchasing this at all.
3,Disappointment,"I exepected something more than what we got. yeah it's neat to have the toys fit within each other... that is a big plus for me when you have to pick up after two kids, however, i anticipated a little better quality. the plastic seems flimsy and i'm a little worried that it will break apart in his mouth... he's teething and everything goes in the mouth. the baseball on the inside has lousy sound and we have to find a new battery for it... one of those ridiculous watch batteries. not unhappy but not happy either."
3,Multi stacking sports balls,"This is not for the younger kids, they cant get it open or shut and get bored quicly except for the noise making part!"
2,Yuck,"These are not fun to look at or play with. They're so hard, he was afraid to toss any of them, I think in fear they'd break or break something else. I was embarrassed to give them as a gift and wish I had just returned this."
4,Sports Balls,"OK.... grandma and grandpa got this set for our son. He loves it! I do agree with the baseball noise in the other review, it is a little noisy and after awhile I just shut it off. These are clunky, but rolling them around on the ground is good fun.I must admit, these are a little flimsy when trying to put back together as they don't lock or stay locked together very easy.Still all in all a good toy. My son loves it."
2,Don't Waste the Money,"I bought into the marketing and tried these plugs on my 2009 Subaru Forester. Simply put, while these plugs are not going to do damage to your car, the performance did not stand up to their claims. Average MPG dropped over 1.5 MPG and that is after paying a higher price than standard plug replacements. Ultimately, I would suggest paying less and getting platinum plugs or spending about a dollar more per plug and getting Iridium. I replaced these E3s with NGK Iridiums and instantly saw an increase of 3.3 MPG. Again, these are not worth the extra money when you could see much better performance with other options. Don't believe the marketing."
2,no better than stock plugs,I bought a set of these plugs less that a year ago have replaced them with a set of NGK plugs the idle of my car has been getting rough over the past few months after reading the reviews of these I decided to swap them for the NGK's idle has improved so much for 100k plugs these lasted less than 10k.
2,"They worked nice for the Geo but, not the Mazda.","I got these plugs for my Geo Tracker last year and they did awesome so I thought I'd go with them for my mazda protege that I just purchased. They worked horribly in that car, making it stutter and had no accelration, it was undrivable. Had to return the product and get NGK g-powers which worked awesomely in my car.Overall review - Not good for mazda."
2,Wild-Buck,"Purchased @ lowe's plug would not fire after about a year took back to lowe'sWas told they didn't warranty had to go to Manufacturer, did that, was told had to send to them to get replacement, shipping would cost more than buying another plug lifetime warranty is a lie in this respectAs for as the plug its ok but no better than Std. Plug"
1,Causes car to idle roughly,"I bought these thinking I would see a slight increase in fuel economy and horsepower. I saw neither, but did find my car idling roughly and shuddering periodically in lower gears. I took it to the shop and they traced it back to these E3 spark plugs. Non-original equipment therefore the issue was not covered under warranty. I'll be changing back to the AC Delco."
5,Pretty Good Plug,"I did install a complete new set of Bosch spark plugs and started my 2001 Pontiac Bonneville and just for fun I decided to try the E3 spark plugs the same day to see if there really are any improvements and there is in my case a definite change in idle and throttle response much more crisp feeling, as for mileage I'd have to say there really hasn't been any change. I also installed an E3 on my Suzuki Ltz 400 from A NGK and I couldn't notice a difference on that so much maybe it's because it's a one cylinder but I'll put some time on it and see where it gets me..."
1,Gimmiky tip on a cheap plug,"Don't buy these plugs. For the same price, you can have Bosch+4, with the same basic tip, and know they won't fail after 400 miles like mine did.Just click ""back"" twice, right now, and you'll be safe."
1,Major mess up by someone who doesn't know car parts,"I ordered a set of E3 spark plugs for a 2004 Toyota Tundra with 4.7L V8 engineWhen items arrived, they were E3.48, the WRONG item for my vehicleI contacted Amazon, specifying that they need to ship E3.64 spark plugs, and returned the packageWhen the replacement items showed up, they were again the WRONG item for my vehicle! They were E3.48sI again contacted Amazon, and their answer was ""we cannot accommodate your request because it is our policy to only send replacement items, not exchange the item""My thoughts: ""What kind of person is manning the order desk?""I'm still waiting for my refund, some 2 weeks later."
2,Bad Spark Plug,"I bought a set of eight plugs for my 2007 Dodge Ram 4.7L. Everything was fine for the first 6 hours then I had a misfire on one of the plugs. I did some troubleshooting, removed and reseated all the ignition coils and still couldn't get the misfire to go away. I took it to the nearest Car X for service thinking I screwed something up. After two hours on the diagnostic machine, it turned out to be a bad plug which cost me $70 to fix. This is the FIRST plug I ever had go bad after 6 hours. I am waiting for the other ones to go bad and cost me even more. Not very impressed so far."
1,Won't last long,"I installed the E3 plugs in my Scion TC after reading their claims. Common sense dictates some truth about any spark plug. If you have worn out plugs and replace them with any decent plug which most are, you'll feel improvements in performance, smooth idle, acceleration and fuel economy. Of all the plugs I've tried, these were the worst thus far. After 40K miles, I felt sputtering and my check engine light came on. After checking the code, found out it was the plugs. I replaced them with NGK Iridium plugs and the problem resolved. I currently have over 307,000 miles on my vehicle so I've tried several brands and the E3 was the worst. Considering time and labor costs, these plugs are not worth the money."
2,first 6 months were great...,"These plugs worked great for the first 6 months! Their power were especially noticeable at low rpms, however come six months I started to get misfires and the engine started running ruffly. I pulled them out and found that the welds holding E clips were all starting to break and separate!Bottom line: Great idea and technology, but needs better manufacturing."
1,"E3 SPARK PLUGS, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","I AM A 28 YEAR ASE MECHANIC. I INSTALLED E3 SPARK PLUGS IN MY TOYOTA TACOMA V6. AFTER 1 MONTH OF REGULAR DAILY DRIVING, KEEPING TRACK OF MILES DRIVEN AND GASOLINE USAGE, AND SENSIBLE DRIVING IN A VERY WELL MAINTAINED VEHICLE I DID NOT SEE ANY FUEL MILEAGE INCREASE OR HORSEPOWER GAIN. IF E3 SPARK PLUGS ARE SO GREAT,,, THEN WHY ARE THE MANUFACTURERS NOT INSTALLING THEM."
1,Very Unsatisfied,"I purchased these headphones because the earbud style is the only ones that would stay in my ear. These kept coming out, and the wire had a short in it. I was very dissapointed in the product. Every time I moved my head they popped out of my ear. I have since then purchased a different name brand and I am very happy with them. They are also the earbud style."
4,Extreamly helpful book.,"I'm SO glad that I bought this book! Im a 1st time compter builder and have been wanting to do it for a while now. This book help ALOT! It basically takes you though the process and what to do and what not to do. If you read this whole book you will be able to put together your own computer in no time. I'd have to say that the only thing that I didn't like was that unless you build the exact computer that they are in the book then its slightly, and I say slightly, alittle harder to do.Again, for 1st time builders this book is definitly a great buy!"
2,"New Book, Old Stereotypes","""Redneck Nation"" is an attempted satire comprised of over- generalizations and stereotyping. Although originally from the South, the author perpetuates stereotypes that are common among North-Easterners, and the film industry. Some are accurate, some partly true, and many blatantly false.Sociological statistics compare northern and southern societies, highlighting the differences, which are interesting.All in all, this attempt to be sardonic, satirical and humorous, turned out to be nothing more that impish adolescence."
5,Too Funny!,"I have read Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and even Ann Coulter. They're great, but now I'm adding a new name to the list: Michael Graham.He calls himself a ""right-wing"" nut but he's really just a funny guy who tells the truth about everyone, especially northern liberals. His stuff about how Berkeley and New York are the new capitals of redneck attitudes on race and free speech was great! He really nails the hypocrisy.I'm giving this book to two friends: One's a southerner who lives up in Minnesota. The other is an obnoxious liberal (but sweet) Yankee friend who lives down here in the South. They're both going to love it."
1,"A strange, strange book","If you enjoy reading the rantings and ravings of a radio personality who says he is a Southerner but hates his upbringing down South, then this book is for you. (Really, there must have been some positive experiences that could have been mentioned.)Graham was onto a good idea for a book; but, he is so full of himself and has such disdain for Southerners that it hurts to read his thoughts. Moreover, he takes on Northerners too, but in a backhanded, insulting way.Truthfully, this author needs a shrink to understand ""who he is and where he came from."" If you can buy this book for $1.99--get it for the last chapter. Otherwise, be warned that you are spending way too much."
5,Excellent camcorder loaded with features,"I have been greatly impressed since I began using my TRV66. It has a wonderful picture, great effects and features. The night-vision thing is fun too! The titles, dates, image fading, and all the features listed in the description work great and allow you to make a wonderful recording."
2,"Compact Camcorder, refuses to switch off or charge battery","I've been using this camcorder for nearly two years. Bought it new in late 1999.A year later, I noticed that the battery that it came with discharged if left in the camcorder, even if the camera is in the OFF position. I thought it was a battery problem & bought a new one, but same story.As a camera, the picture is very good. No complaints on the audio pick-up either. Simple & easy connectivity to the TV for viewing or mastering to tape.Latest problem is that in the OFF position, all the lights come on, & the battery doesn't charge. In the CAMERA position, the VTR lights come on.I believe the problem lies with the CAMERA-OFF-VTR slider switch in the front, which seems to have been discontinued in later models. A friend with a similar SONY camcorder, using the same switch reported the exact same problems, as did one other user on some e-board.Bottom line, not recommended as the slider switch seems to be problematic."
4,Great Replacement 8mm Camera,"In 1992, I bought a Sony CCD FX-510 8mm stereo camcorder. By February 2000, we had worn the old camera out, after working around the world! If you want to keep playing 8mm tapes, you either have to replace your 8mm camcorder, or buy a 8mm deck. The camcorders are cheaper than a deck! I bought the Sony CCD-TRV66 because it could play my stereo 8mm tapes from my old camera. A digital Sony camcorder would do this, but at more $. The best surprise was that playback on the new HI-8 camcorder seemed to deliver higher resolution on the old Video 8 tapes. This might be due to the filtering on the Hi-8 camcorder. The TRV-66 has image stabilization, nightshot, Hi-8 resolution, stereo sound, lots of digital features and a color flip out screen. All of this is still less than I paid in 1992 for the CCD FX-510. After 8 years, Sony kept continuity on operational features; the basic functions of their camcorders is the same. Kudos for great design. I plan to wear out this camera, too!"
5,"Great features, never a problem","Had this camera for a couple years now and have never had a problem. Can't ask for any more features. The battery still holds a charge for over 4hrs of use. The image quality is great and the audio pickup(stereo) works fabulously. Only complaint would be the Camera/off/VTR switch, but not for the same reason as the others listed. I just don't like the location of it and it can be a little bit of a hassle getting it to the off position. But I've never had a problem with it not turning the camera off or the light on.Botton line: Easy, simple to use and connect to a TV or to a computer for emailing video (with the right computer hardware)."
3,"Good features, but annoying switch problem","I've had this TRV66 for 3 years, but the problem started occuring 1 year after I bought it. It was doing great until the switch started messing up. I found out only after my batteries keep draining even after I switched the camera off. Finally, I noticed that when I turn the camera off by switching it to the ""Off"" position, the VTR lights come on instead. The only way I could really turn it off was to remove the battery. So, when I want to switch it off, I had to remove the battery every time so that it won't get drained. Looks like it is a common problem from the reviews that I've read. Another annoying problem is when I am recording for a while, it keeps going to stand-by mode automatically. So I had to keep an eye on the viewfinder to make sure it doesn't stop recording. I wonder if Sony could fix this problem."
5,Camcorder,I used other camcorder in my life. The one I like the best is Sony CCDTRV66 Handycam Hi8 Camcorder.
4,Very Happy,"good price if you want to just try them out, now that i have the all leather bag will be my next buy."
5,It's Klein...,"A great bag. The 5416 bag is the standard in the industry. These do wear out, usually the belt loops go before the bag. They are tried and true to the building trades. These are the bags that Iron Workers usually use. I use these bags on my climbing harness while doing tower work. The price is perfect."
2,not a good product,"This product is not good at all. First, I spent a lot of time getting the phone to fit in. The case is very-very tight. Then, every time I have to charge the phone I have to take the case off because there is not enough room to plug the charger in. The plastic teared off on one side."
3,Sticks in printer,I purchased this paper and I have a Lexmark P6250 all-in-one printer. The paper sticks and I have wasted several sheets.I would not recommend purchasing this paper.
5,Located What I wanted.,"Lexmark 21G1738 Photo Paper (4x6, 100 Sheets)After looking in several local office supply stores and not finding this paper that I use for my photo printer. I decided to look on the Internet and found it at Amazon.com. It is what I was looking for. I am very pleased with the product."
5,A keeper,"I've read multiple books in my search for different types of orgasms and learning why I haven't been able to completely let go, even though I really want to. Deborah Sundahl is brilliant and really knows what's going on with women and sexual satisfaction. This is a great guide for learning about the way to release emotions and have wonderful orgasms, and how those are very much linked together. It's also great if you just want to learn how to have G-spot orgasms and ejaculate, even if you don't want to know about the underlying emotions."
5,A whole new world of pleasure!,"Deborah Sundahl goes way beyond ordinary guidance. Most women by now are familiar with the G spot, but Sundahl talks about more detailed physiological aspects of sex.I do not understand why someone would need more explicit instructions -- she gets completely graphic and detailed!The sex toy section was especially helpful and fun to read.For women who want to learn more about their own sexuality, this book is essential -- one of the best to come along."
2,very clinical and repetitive,I had hoped this would be a book my wife and I could read that would give us good instruction and spark her interest in the subject. It is crazy boring and hard to read. The info is there but repeated over and over and over in a very clinical manner. Nothing entertaining or erotic here. My wife read about three pages and will not pick it back up. I read it but did not enjoy it at all.
5,"Fantastic, Positive, Encouraging, Supportive!!!!!","Excellent book!! Very easy to read and written by a woman who obviously cares very deeply about true femininity and honouring beauty in all women. Very encouraging and following the ""process"" [...]"
2,tech humor doesn't age well,"Topical humour doesn't tend to age well. Tech humour, or at least this tech humour, is no different. Some of it is still amusing as a short trip down memory lane. This isn't enough to warrant a whole book of columns. Early columns are wittier than the later columns, but have lost their humour over the years. Later columns suffer from being much too long and either taking forever to reach their point, or beating it to death. Long-time geeks will smile knowingly at some pieces, and perhaps be amused to recall those days when people actually coded in Pascal. Ultimately, though, the collection is unsatisfying.The best analogy to reading this is what happens when a relative belatedly discovers the Internet. Suddenly, my inbox is filled with all those old jokes that have been going around forever. I remember once being amused by them, but those days are long gone, and now I'm just a bit annoyed by seeing them all over again."
4,Excellent course,This course is about 20 plus years old but is quality instruction on improving reading speed. Cassettes may be an obstacle for some. Fair price as well.
4,Simple and Classy (but not ceramic),Got it for my mum and she seemed to like it. It deep and holds ladles and spoons of any size. It would have been great if it was ceramic but for the price you cannot ask much more. The design is simple and classy.
2,still could be better,all ok but the turning is only possible through reverse which is not reliable as transmission differential or whatever it is doesnt have enough force. so the toy model can only spin backward on flat polished surface not on carpet. cheap toy
3,"Good concept, poor execution","It seems like a good toy, it's just not good quality. It breaks too easily. I wouldn't recommend it. It's too disappointing for the kids when it breaks."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Usually a story like this is the setting for a ghostly horror movie. In this case, it's the setting for a s***** movie. The story itself wasn't that bad, but Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone have no chemistry what so ever....and then there's Stephen Dorff. THIS is the tough guy, out of prison, who wants his house back??? This little twerp?! Who did the casting for this movie? Even the kids wouldn't be scared of Stephen Dorff! I general like the people in the cast of this film, but it's like they did this movie as a favor to someone. It really doesn't flow, the characters are unbelievable, and the story was just OK. I'd say pass on this one."
2,Sure not the best of the movie soundtrack,"Its very difficult to sit in judgement of anothers artistic efforts , but I just did not find this very enjoyable. Volume one of the soundtack was excellent , but not this one."
2,commitments vol2,"Not as good as the original ( not volume 2 )If you want to hear music featured throughout the movieget the cd titled just ""The Commitments"""
1,Doesn't fit the Subscribe & Save 750ml Da Vinci syrup bottles,"If you're like me, and order your Da Vinci syrups in the Subscribe & Save 3pack ... don't get this pump. It's too wide for the bottle neck (i.e. it won't fit and you'll be sending it back). I assume this pump is meant for the 750ml glass bottles, as the description basically says ""fits 750ml Da Vinci syrups"". The ones you get via Subscribe & Save are plastic. That is my best guess.Regardless, I ordered it. It doesn't fit, not even close. So it's in the UPS dropbox as we speak. I'm not sure what pump WILL work, and I can't determine via the other pump reviews if they will fit the 750ml Da Vinci plastic bottle."
3,Good fun but messy and not durable,"My little princess loved using the make-up on herself, but each make-up has only a little in its space. Plus the plastic is very flimsy and it didn't last long. Not very good quality at all."
4,Form Critical Search for Christology of Jesus,"Witherinton is good at what he does--plays the historial critical game and uses it against them.Here his aim is clear: ""I intend to state as much as I think is plausible about how Jesus viewed himself, particularly with respect to christological matters, in an attempt to associate Christian faith with the life of the Jesus of history.""He concludes that Jesus thought of himself as having a unique relationship with God, his Son and anointed with the eschatological Spirit, above all humans and angels. He saw himself taking on Isaiah's prophecy of Israel's representative suffering servant. Especially does all this tie in his title ""son of man."" When he comes to the question of deity, he hedges and waffles a bit.Interesting read in the continuing search for the historical Jesus."
1,Do not buy the kindle version!,The ebook's font has been set to a real bloated and hard to read font type that cannot be changed unlike other ebooks. It is a pain on the eye to read for long periods on the kindle or ipad. Such a shame. Defeats the purpose of an ebook. Had to get a refund straightaway. 1 star for kindle version. Book seems to be interesting but will need to get a hard copy to give a proper review.
5,Well Crafted...,"The Mark of The Lion continues the Scottish Crown Series(no.3). You can read any of the books alone, but I think it helps to read them in the right order, if possible, because there are characters that spill over from one story into the next. I enjoyed this book because it has romance (love, love, love), drama (attempted kidnappings,sword fights), intrigue (why is he so scarred and bitter?), spiritual insights (God is faithful and good even when our world doesn't make sense), and historical facts(Scotland 1300's, lassies, weaving, lamb shearing). All elements that make a good story go (and keeps me turning the pages). The main reason I liked it, however, was because she tells a logical story. There are reasons that each character acts the way they do, and it makes sense. Have you ever read a book and wondered, ""why is the character saying this or doing that?"" Well, with this book, you won't be. If you want a well crafted book, read this. :)"
5,Great historical,"Another great historical from Carol Umberger. Robert the Bruce is determined to drive Prince Edward of England's troops out of Scotland. The English are confident and well equipped. Countess Orelia Radbourne accompanied her husband, the Earl of Radbourne, expecting they would be victorious. Instead her husband is dead, Edwards troops were defeated, and Orelia is a captive of Robert the Bruce and the hated Scots. Cealloch, Robert the Bruce's foster brother is charged with guarding her. Cealloch has lost everything. He is not safe anywhere, but he has put himself at risk to serve his brother. In spite of themselves, Orelia and Cealloch begin to trust each other and form a bond neither wanted.Carol Umberger knows her history and she weaves the story into a rich tapestry full of color and pagentry. I highly recommend this one."
2,REMASTER NOW!,"Everyone knows this ain't one of the best Elton albums-- he regularly disowns it during interviews-- but it does have some great material on it. Why is 'Victim Of Love' remastered and not 'Leather Jackets'? It's about as good as 'Ice On Fire' and 'Breaking Hearts'. Songs like 'Paris', 'Slow Rivers' and 'Angeline' deserve better treatment, along with those missing b-sides. Rocket has done a fine job with all those discs missed by the so-called Classic Years. Get onto it, Rocket!"
3,My 2 Cents,"I saw Elton John live at the time Leather Jackets was about to be released. He played Paris live that night. He was truly proud of Paris and I thought it was going to be the first single. There is so much B-side material from this time. Billy and the Kids, Lord Of The Flies, Highlander and a completely different mix of Heartache All Over The World. I'd love to see a re-issue with the B-sides."
3,in many countries this album sold well,"In many countries around the world this album sold very well at the time it was released.It is not a bad album.It does take a number of listens before it grows on you.Many of elton johns albums years later are appreciated and this means that in my opinion he is always years ahead of the music of the year he releases his albums.During the 80s it was only in america elton did not have a top ten album.In many countries around the world he had many top ten albums.A good example of this is Australia.In australia during the 80s these albums made top ten:Jump Up,Too Low For Zero,Breaking Hearts,Ice On Fire,Leather Jackets,Live In Australia,Reg Strikes Back,Sleeping With The Past And a year later in 1990 Sleeping With The Past Made Number One."
2,"Looky there, Heartache All Over The Worlds on this disc!","Not a good effort,this is as far as elton got from a quality album,but ther are some brief,i mean breif,shining moments.Hoop of fire,Heartache....,I Fall Apart and Slow Rivers is the shining moments.But this is just my opinion,others may be defferent."
3,"Not the best,not the worst","This album which came out before Live in Australia,does have many gems.One of them is PARIS.Why wasn't it the first single?.Instead the mediocre HEARTACHE...made the charts.The beautiful duet with Cliff Richard SLOW RIVERS and MEMORY OF LOVE(where Queen members played)stand out as great tunes.Not a classic but worth listening to."
3,leather jackets,"Ok, this is probably the weakest Elton's album from 70'es but it's still prove that Elton can write a song with melody even when he has no inspiration at all. It's really not album for one star. My personal favourites are: 1. heartache all over the world, 2.I fall apart 3. go it alone and 4. Angeline. The worst song to me is the title song. This is pop of the 80'es and comparing with other pop music, this is a good music."
2,Elton's Worst Album From The 1980's,"I guess Elton and Bernie were running out of steam, Elton was tired of David Geffen's record company, or perhaps both. Although this album does have a couple of decent ballads, ""Slow Rivers"" (Elton's duet with Cliff Richard), ""Hoop Of Fire"", and especially, ""Paris"", the rest is dreadful filler, including the only hit single from this album, ""Heartache All Over The World"". It's a pity that Gus Dudgeon's last studio recording with Elton was this dreadful mess. Still, this album is better than Elton's brief foray into disco, ""Victim Of Love"", which is certainly his worst."
2,Reply to Alan Taylor,I thought `Slow Rivers' and `Hoop of Fire' were the only two decent tracks on it. They may be worthless lyrically but...the former is one of those occasions when he locates those one or two `magic' chords that make all the difference between a song being boring and being brilliant. (Guessed which chords?) The latter is beyond analysis: for whatever reason I register it as `a decent tune'.But the rest of the album is deadly dull. Two (maybe three: `Angeline'?) good songs + lots of boring ones = the formula for most EJ albums since the 70s.
1,Sounds like a kiss off to Geffen Records,"John by this point was probably so tired, and sick that he just probably released this to fufill his contract, and move on. He did have some successes at Geffen, but this sounds like the relationship had soured as there is no traditional piano on this as it sounds like all keyboards and machines. It really zapped out the beauty of what these songs could've been. I don't feel that anyone could in his right mind release such material as this. Mind you I found 1986 to be a rather off year for music anyway as alot of the songs seemed to be taken over by machines. Fortunately John got out, and went back to his roots."
2,Bad,"This is one of Eltons worst albums, produced at a low point in his private life. Worse still; this is the low point in the way Eltons albums were produced throughout the 80's and to a lesser degree the 90's. The album is full of credits like ""Synth Sequences"", GS-1, DX7 etc. As as a result the album sounds awful - all the bad things about 80's music are evident on this album.So why 2 stars and not 1 then? Well I'll tell you why, because there are some good songs buried behind the monstrous production. Despite his drug and alcohol problems at the time these are still Elton John songs. However even on most average Elton albums you'll normally find one classic track - not this album I'm afraid.So my recommendation is don't buy it."
2,"Yet another step down from the previous ICE ON FIRE,","unbelievingly nearly 2/3rds of this album are either musical or lyrical low points on an album put to waste.Aside from VICTIM OF LOVE, the horrifiying low point in eltons career ,this is as far elton got from a near quality album ever.the tunes are cheap 80s thumping beats filled with dissapointing lyrics.Heartache all over the world, the albums only near hit,still isn't that great.Although i seemed to like a track,Slow rivers that isn't anything like a track off of some of his earlier albums.The only reason i can see for buying this disk is If you want to throwaway your money.Not good at all."
1,Strictly for collectors,"Even a lifelong Elton fan like me can't find much positive to say about this effort, in fact it's embarassing to listen to. Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin produced an album devoid of any quality songs. Even Elton's melodies which have saved so many of his sugary balads seem dull and over produced.'I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog' & ' I'd rather leap through a hoop of fire' - how can you listen to lyrics like this without cringing.Take a listen to 'Tumbleweed Connection' or 'Elton John' and you'll wonder if this is the same songwriting team."
3,"OK, OK, sure...","Not one of his best, certainly, but there are at least two if not three standout tracks. Number one, Paris. This is one of Elton's most moving songs, both lyrically (Thanks Bernie!) and musically . It's also one of his better vocalized songs. Number two, Go It Alone. OK, yeah, Elton looks pretty ridiculous on the back cover of this cd, but he sounds like he's earned that Leather Jacket in this tune. Elton? Tough guy? Well... And finally, C, Slow River. I'm sorry, I'm a sucker for a male male duet, especially with the silver-lined voice of England's own Cliff Richard. (Anyone remember his duet with Olivia Newton-John on the Xanadu Soundtrack? Pure bliss!) Oh, what am I saying. I just love this cd because it reminds me of my ex-lover Steve..."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...looking at a bunch of older guys with leather jackets and motorcycles is laughable...who ever thought of that photo opportunity should loose their camera privledges. The title song is strong and ""Heartache"" and ""Angeline"" are decent tracks. An overlooked album that probably deserves a bit more credit than it's comical cover."
1,"Awful, Do not waste your money.","This movie was absolutely, positively one of the worse movies I have ever seen.1-the characters in the movie do not match with the picture on the cover of the DVD.2-The storyline is poorly written and inconsistent.3-The vidotaping jumps around -indicative of low-budget.4-The characters do not have much depth at all. The father? or perhaps he is the step-father-well the actor who plays him does not seem to be in the cover picture photo.5-The storyline seems abstract. The viewer has to guess much of what is not spoken. They should have given a written background information.It seems like the movie is a second-part or continuation of another storyline...as if the first part of the story is missing. I totally missed the reading the reviews before buying this poor attempt.Do not waste your money."
1,I Should Have Heeded the Warnings,"I am the type of person who usually goes against reviews in an attempt to support Black media. Up until this point, I have never felt that it was a waste. This movie certainly changed that. I have never seen such a horrible movie. All of the previous reviews are accurate descriptions of the horrendous nature of this movie. I purchased this movie so that my family and I can continue in our tradition of watching holiday movies with a black cast. I was so embarrassed. My parents and sister kept asking me what in devil did I have them watching. After 15 mins, my family began commentary about the movie. The commentary was WAY better than the movie. I guess the movie did work to give my family and I some laughs, but we could have found laughs without me wasting my money. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE!!!!!"
1,Please pass this one by!,10 minutes in the movie and I'm ready to turn it off. I got a free code from Redbox so I decided to check this one out. And boy was thisa mistake.I ca't tell who's related and how. The acting is terrible and what the heck is supposed to be the storyline.....Dont waste your time or money purchasing or renting this one.
1,AWFUL!!!,"This is the most horrible, low budget movie I've ever seen. This was a waste of money and I don't recommend anyone pay a dime to watch. I wasted both my time & money. It is not a part of my movie collection and has been placed where all trash goes.....IN THE GARBAGE!!!"
1,Horrendous is an understatement,"You know how you rent/buy/download/stream a movie knowing it is probably low budget and bootleg in quality - you do this in hopes that the movie is so bad that it is actually good (in a B-movie kind of way). Well this movie is so bad that it is actually bad. Scratch that, it is so bad that it is downright embarrassing. When you watch this debacle you will be amazed at the overall lack of any redeeming cinematic qualities. The acting is atrocious, the plot is non-existent, and the production is rudimentary at best. In short, if you made a movie with your cell phone it would be a cinematic masterpiece compared to this sad excuse for a movie. Believe it or not this was the kindest review I could come up with. Don't take my word, watch it for yourself and see if you have any love for this street corner/back alley production."
1,This is Junk.,"Julio Iglesias' son's debut album makes a mockery out of Latin music. The Spanish version of the album is terrble and the Italian version is even worse. He is the current teen pop idol in Latin America, but for how long? His voice does not even come close to other Latin crooners such as Luis Miguel or Alejandro Fernandez. Don't waste your money on this CD."
1,Horrible Cd,"I give this Cd 1 star because you can't give it anything less. The songs are horrible, Enrique Iglesias does not know how to sing and he thinks he it the greatest thing on this universe. It seems like if he is crying, has a stomach ache, and pushing(like if he is going to deliver a baby or something) while he is singing. A waste of money and time."
5,A very Good Album from the beaginning to the end,This cd is definitely worth it because it is so clever and neat. I decide to buy this albun because I new Enrique and I am learning Italian. I can easly lisen to this CD several times w/o getting bored. El album posede casi unicamanete de baladas muy ingeniosas y bellas. Sinceramente este un disco que pueden eschuchar durante una romatica noche frente a frente con su ser querido. Si queiren escuchar algo diferente por favor ensayen este disco...
2,REPITITVE!,"The Wagon Wheel series is just one book with three different titles. I read the first book thinking this is ok, not too bad. But I very quickly realized in book 2 I was reading the same exact story just different character names. Not even different characters, just the names changed. I could honestly say it was a waste of money to buy book 2 and 3. Not because the stories were bad neccesarily, but they were the exact same as book 1. It was a little dissapointing."
3,Read the Condition Carefully,"It took only a few days for my book to arrive. As the original sales notice had stated, it was not in excellent condition, being bent on the corner and creased in the front having been a discarded library book. However, it was not in poor condition either and is still in an acceptable form to grace my personal library shelf. The content of the book was marvelous and well-written. This particular series of books can be read in any order, as the books are not necessarily connected. Santa Fe Woman contains enough drama to satisfy any who read it."
4,Frankenstein!,I love these old Hammer Studios movies. They always seem pretty atmospheric to me and well done for their time. I've enjoyed the Hammer Dracula movies with Christopher Lee. I recommend them all.
3,Nice first effort,"Hmm, after hearing the rest of Enrique's CDs, doesn't it seem like there's something missing from this one? The answer is simple - a CD that doesn't sound like the whole CD's on repeat. The first eight songs here all sound the same, although there are moments of brilliance on Experencia Religiosa (which was covered in English by Boyzone a few years later), and Enrique sounds so young and cute on Por Amarte. The mould is broken with Muñeca Cruel, which is a bit faster, and a lot easier to distinguish from the rest. Consequently it's my favourite. Inventame, is a ballad, like almost every other track, but it's more interesting, I like it. This is not a CD to play at a party, but it's nice if you've had a hectic day, and you want to chill out. If you want a better sound, try Vivir or Cosas Del Amor"
4,His 1st CD; it sets the stage for the man we now know.,"Even though he's young, this CD delivers some of Enrique's most popular and memorable ballads. His trademark, sexy voice shines all the way through.This album has Por Amarte, which is so sweetly done, and Si Tu Te Vas, a huge hit. But the reason I bought this CD was for my personal favorite, Experiencia Religiosa. Perfectly named, from the first few lines you'll feel like you're having a religious experience YOURSELF as Enrique sings to you. Muy, muy caliente..."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible.",Another proof of the bad taste. Singers like this should sing only in their shower.
1,It helps to have famous parents,The album contains pretty mediocre songs. The voice of the singer is very irritating. I couldn't get even to the end of the album. His success is based on the talent of his promoters.
2,better,I prefer his spanish ballads over english dance songs but still this album leaves me empty. Nothing moves me.
5,enrique what more is there to say,"i have been a fan of enrique's for years, this is one of the best cd's he has made. do not let anyone get there first, this is the one for you."
1,UGH!,"This is one of the most distasteful albums ever leleased by a recording company. If you listen to ""Si Tú Te Vas"" you can clearly hear the obvious lack of a good voice that Enrique has. The delivery of the vocals is quite disastrous to say the least and according to experts in music, such as Manzanero, ""he is a fabricated figure that does not interpret the songs from the heart"". Rather, he sells simply and ONLY because of his image, which is not too appealing, by the way."
3,"Nice,but as usual,He's better in english.....","What can I say?I like this better the costa,but enrique is better english.way to emotional,which isnt bad,but it means nothing to me since I still can't understand spanish.His english CD,enrique,is excellent.its one of my favs.Your fasts songs are the best,enrique,but I want more english!"
5,Love it,I have had this album for years on cassette and have been looking for the cd for quite some time...amazon is the only place I have found it...I love this album and have been going crazy since my cassette got ruined a few months ago and I haven't found the cd in any stores (including local mexican stores) or on ebay or anything.
3,Excellent !!!!!,I am a new Enrique Iglesias listener. Here in S.A. we are not exposed to a lot of Spanish/Latin music. It is like a breath of fresh air....... Relaxing and very passionate.
5,Simply Satisfying,"No critic will deny that there is something to be learned from every experience. Music is personal and how it makes you ""feel"" is based upon your experiences, be it limited or varied. Since this album inspires people to learn the Spanish language, it is worth its weight in gold. There is also much to be said for simplicity, too many times we find ourselves asking ""what did they sing?"" Enrique appears to be paving his own way rather than hanging on his father's laurels. A picture is worth a thousand words and he cuts a most impressive one indeed. If this is what attracts audiences to embrace the Spanish language and the music, it is truly una experienca. Muchas gracias."
1,How Did This Man Ever Get A Record Deal?,"One of the most overrated releases of 1995. Enrique Iglesias, the son of Julio Iglesias took the Latin music world by storm with this release. There is nothing great about this CD. Buy it for your children,but older audiences are better off listening to a more sophisticated sound, such as Luis Miguel."
1,Ball Clock,"Always wanted a clock like this one. Found it on Amazon.com. Price actually declined. Should have paid more attention to reviews. Clock stopped running after two days. Changed batteries and it ran for ten days. Purchased brand new batteries and it ran for almost three weeks before stopping. It is interesting, informative, noisy but not worth anything if it doesn't work. I am sending it back which is another reason I shop at Amazon.com. They protect us buyers."
3,don't buy it here,This is the coolest clock I've ever seen. I bought one and it is awesome. It's a little noisy when the minutes change (and even noisier when the hour changes) but it's a great conversation piece. Don't buy it here though. You can get it for about $40 from Fat Brain Toys. People gave it glowing reviews on their website.
1,Clock stopped working after 3 minutes,"This may be the lowest quality product I have ever owned. I got it as a christmas gift, set the time, and put batteries in it. The arm grabbed the first ball, then the second, when the 3rd minute came around the arm didn't move. I started inspecting it for awhile and reading through all of its paperwork, then about ten minutes later the arm started working again. It worked for another few hours off and on. At the end of the first day, it was about 4 hours behind. By the next morning several of the balls had fallen off of the track and the arm had quit working all together. ...In addition, the second level arm was misaligned and only worked by manually moving it. Worst product ever, DO NOT BUY."
1,i wish i didnt get it,i was talking about this clock for the longest time to my aunt and then she found this one and got it to me. i was so excited. i bought some new batteries and put them in and it didnt work. it just didnt work. i dont know why. i didnt drop it or mess with it in any way it just doesnt work. at least the one i got. now i feel bad because my aunt wasted money on this for me.
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this as an educational gift for my sons. Thought it would be interesting for them to see how time could be calculated by another means. This ran great for two weeks then the ball lifting mechanism stopped working, it wasn't the batteries. No one touched the mechanism. I should have known that the quality of this product was no good with a 45 day warranty and returned it. I didn't send in the warranty card and I'm kicking myself now. I will never buy another product made by this company!"
1,junk,"don,t expect it to last .second set batteries and now its off 15 -30 min a day tried the ac adapter route doesn.t even worktry something else"
2,Great Fun but Breaks down fast,I love this clock but after three months of flawless performance the arm stopped working. I am going to try to fix it but we will see.
2,Almost cool,"This is a really cool product, however there is a flaw in the tracks. The balls get backed up on themselves, so, the time is constantly getting messed up. It is also kind of loud. So, I don't suggest keeping it in your bedroom.;)This could be a REALLY awesome clock, they just need to figure out the tracks."
3,it's ok but not durable in the least.,"I had one of the old electric ones that I bought at a garage sale. It was very durable and the motor finally died. I bought this one. Within about 2 minutes of having it out of the box the battery cover snapped trying to put it on over the batteries. Other than that it is working fine and is as noisy as I remember. We will see how it goes. I will update this review if the clock dies. Other than that it is noisy. I tend to ignor it but if noise (particularly a clunking like noise) bothers you then don't keep this is a study room or a quiet room. Also, it doesn't have an on/off switch so you either have to unplug it or pull a battery. The batteries are split 3 to 1 so it looks as though they took that into account. I give it a 3. Would be a 4 if it had a switch and was more durable. A 5 if in addition to that they find a way to make it more accurate and possibly quieter (I know that's a challenge with metal on plastic but hey, one can hope.)"
1,A piece of junk,"The concept it demonstrates is an interesting one, but the toy itself is flimsy and it can't be used as a clock because balls fall off or get stuck because the troves don't return into the right position."
4,High quality wooden spiral track ????,"In Product Features was sad:""High quality wooden spiral track""it is nice, fun but not wooden just plasticCan You Imagine Time Machine Tabletop Clock"
4,The best gift I ever bought my husband,"My husband was thrilled with this gift. He had one as a child and talked about it often. He says he could just sit and watch it all day. It does not seem very durable, however, and the clear plastic case arrived with scratches on the sides and back. I'm not returning it though, because my husband is too enthralled with it. It's noisy but we just don't put it in our bedroom!"
2,Enjoyable but unreliable,"Product is fascinating and enjoyable, but does not perform consistently. The balls often fall off the track, requiring the user to reset the time. It appears that it would be possible for the manufacturer to eliminate this problem, but as it currently stands, the product requires frequent resetting of the time."
1,Does not keep time,"I've always wanted one of these, finally purchased one and majorly disappointed. The balls get stuck, and it does not keep accurate time. I still have it in my office because it is such a cool concept, but very disappointed."
2,It worked just for two weeks.,"It worked just for two weeks, after that I had to fix any broken part almost every day! Then I decided to abandon fixing it. It is a lost case!"
4,Clever Toy,This is my fourth Time Machine. One was not working when I receivedit; Two stopped working after a few months. The warrantee is onlyfor two months. My current Time Machine is working perfectly afterabout seven weeks.It is noisey at night when the house is quiet. I still enjoywatching it work.
1,Junk,"Do not purchase under any circumstances. This product is a ripoff at any price. It will never work for even a two hour period, so you have to constantly watch it. When it does cease working (which is constant) you have to try to move the small steel balls to the right slots. This is very difficult (1) because the construction of the machine makes it difficult to get your fingers in place and fumble around to set the balls in the proper slots without having them fall off, and (2) there are a number of small crevices where the balls get caught and are hard to dislodge. (Yes, I know how that all sounded, but I was not going to call them ""round objects"" instead of ""balls."")It is also very cheaply made, and the moving parts do not have enough clearance. This problem also makes the clock stop operating. Save your money for a better one."
1,broke after a few months,"I oringinally gave this five stars but it stopped working about a month ago. The dial still works but the arm delivering the balls to the racks stopped working. It kept pretty good time while it worked, but now I guess it goes in the trash."
4,neat,bought it for my husbands father for christmas. the whole family watched it and thought it was really neat. something for the grandkids to watch when they spend time at there house
1,Doesn't include DC adaptor!! Don't Buy!,"Upon opening this product I discovered it doesn't come with a plug in option, but rather requires 4 ""C"" batteries that aren't included, of course. What an obnoxious discovery. I will be returning this product."
3,Conversation piece,"It's definitely a conversation piece, but it certainly needs to have its own electrical connection. Although it operates on batteries, it can also work with house current, and that is the most efficient and economical means."
1,A Neat Toy but it WILL fail.,"I've owned 4 of these since the late 90s. It's a really neat toy (that you should keep somewhere where the noise it produces isn't bothersome). Unfortunately, the motor for the arm WILL inevitably die or become erratic. I continued to buy them because I still liked them (thought they were very neat) even though I knew it'd fail. Just a heads up!"
1,"Interesting concept, poor poor construction","The innovative nature of this clock prompted me to buy it in the first place. Unfortunately, the clock stopped working within one hour of commissioning and is now nothing more than a piece of plastic in a box with a few ball bearings thrown in for good measure. The construction of the clock is of a very very poor quality. when fitting the battery in the seconds compartment, the components of the clock tend to fall out if you are not careful. The gears are very flimsy plastic and these are what control the clock. Nice concept but not worth buying due to the poor quality"
1,ITEM IS JUNK,What a piece of JUNK ! These were both Christmas gifts. The first one died in mid-January and now the second one has died before it was 2 months old. DO NOT BUY!
3,Stopped working,"Stopped working as these machines do. Even after going to 120 system. I like the idea, but they never work for very long."
2,didn't last long,"Really cool clock. Very impressive for about a month...then it just sort of slowly fell apart and became 100% non-functional. The ball retriever started to act up and get stuck and not return the balls to the starting point...so it not only didn't tell time, it stopped moving altogether. Too bad, really. My 12 year old spent a lot of his own money on this item. Broken clock, sad kid."
2,disappointed!,"I expected so much more from this book. Nelson, like him or not he has so much info on the Family that this book could have been great. Unfortunately Bill jumps from topic to topic and mispells many words. I would love to read a book soley on the Family and not Manson and the crimes. I dont recommend this book unless of course you are a collector of Manson books."
3,Interesting theories on the murders- poor editing.,"Bill Nelson knowledge on the Manson case is acute here. His theories and comparisons are interesting for any avid reader of True Crime. A must read for any one that owns Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter"". If you can stand the typos, poor editing and his lack of using graphic language ( I guess due to his own moral beliefs ?) It also seems to me that he pissed off many people who entrusted him during the writing of this book. Read it and you will see for yourself. For those interested in the case ( as I was) only."
2,well written but SLOPPILY put together,well researched book but whomever proof read this book did a horrible job!! Numerous mis-spellings and tons of periods missing. When i contacted the author to tell him that i enjoyed his book i also wrote VERY NICELY that he needed a better proofreader. He sent me back a NASTY email. I now think very lowly of this rude author
4,Incredible research and detail,"Yes, yes, there are spelling errors, but get past them and you have a book filled with fully researched details on the Manson clan and those who survived the brainwashings. Everyone is here, with facts on the Mansons' recent lies and the killers' recent activities. Bill Nelson (along with Vince Bugliosi) is the authority on the Mansons, and even if this book did not get properly proofread, it's a great read and, I have to say, a must-have for those interested in the case!"
1,This book is incompetently written and edited.,"This has to be one of the worst books in print. The author, who fancies himself a ""journalist"", is a semiliterate kook who writes at a gradeschool level. The entire book is nothing but a collage of disconnected fragments, strung together by Mr. Nelson's emotionally retarded, barbarously composed commentary. If there was an editor of this book, he or she is unfamiliar with the English language, as there are typos and misspellings on every other page. And get this: anytime so-called ""bad words"" appear, the letters ""XXX"" are inserted to censor them, rendering some sections even less comprehensible. This pathetic effort might provide Manson obsessives with some tidbits of information, or perhaps it could serve as a textbook example of everything a real investigative work should not be, but there is nothing here to justify the cutting down of the trees it took to put this drivel before the public."
4,"Interesting content, but please--get literate!","My one-line summary, above, captures what I have to say about this book. Indeed, what is in it is VERY fascinating, but how can anyone let something that badly written and edited go to print??? I'm a little shocked at Nelson's comment that those who criticize the book's editing are ""devil worshippers."" (What could he possibly mean by claiming that? It makes him sound less than sane.) Maybe they were just LITERATE.... Anyway, I do appreciate the contribution of his content to this ever-fascinating subject."
3,Better camcorder out there,"Hi Everyone, I believe that this is a good cam corder but recently I bought Sony DCR-TRV 120. It is year 2000 model and has got all the features normally you find them in Sony camcorder, plus it has got 45x/450X zoom and I got it for 650$. Very good deal. Picture quality is amazing. 21/2 "" screen is kinda small but still it works fine. In short check out this camara before you go for any other model."
5,hi 8 camera,Started using the camera immediately to save 8mm tapes to DVD. Camera functions as hoped. Meets everything it was advertised to be. Shipped well and on time. Looking forward to using it more.
4,Long lasting shaver,"I bought this shaver at least 5 years ago and it is still going strong. I replace the blades about every 18months or so and have had no problems charging the batteries as I have lived and traveled extensively in Europe, Africa, and the states. The batteries don't hold a charge as long as they used to, but I still easily get a couple weeks out of a full charge. It does what it is supposed to do without any hassle. Gonna buy another set of blades to see how long this razor will last."
3,Somewhat Disappointing but overall a good CD,"I heard ""In Search of Avalon"" on United Airlines as my introduction to Paul Thornton. I really enjoyed that song a lot so decided to purchase the CD. Cut 7 ""Forest Pathways"" lived fully up to my expectations for the CD. I prefer a little more melodic music than I found in most of the other cuts. I am glad I bought this CD but it won't be one I can play nonstop."
3,Smooth man doin his thing,A lot of ladies have melted over this. I'm glad I listened to someone who had a great impression on the game.
3,Well done album - In it's time was very popular,"One of my friends turned me on to this album many years ago and it has some catchy well made cuts on it that bring back some good memories. May not impress the new age drive by rap scene, however if your of a less violent nature you might find this album refreshing. Has some cool slow jams that the ladies liked , doesn't quite make the candle light atmosphere but maybe a lowlight romantic evening."
4,Waiting a more detailed book... hurry up writers,"This is a great book for a great movie. Final Fantasy is a mark in the industry of games, and now in movies too.Unhapply, the authors dont explain technical approaches, what is very important in a film like this.But i have used it in my animation classes, and specially the roughs, sketches and scene previews have turn on the ligh over the head of my pupils.I hope someone could write a book about analisys of the technical aspects of this mark in animation industry."
4,Just by it for the beauty,"The only reason you'll want to by it is to have a wonderful collection of stills from the movie (and many that aren't from the movie). There's quite a bit of filler text (for example, the entire script from the movie takes 20 pages), but it's still chock full of pictures. Buy it for that reason and you'll be very very happy."
4,Grandpa Purchased for Grandson,"I purchased an extra long sleeping bag as a Christmas present for my grandson who is going kayak tripping June 2010. I also purchased this small synthetic sleeping pillow to go with it. It is pretty small and one might want to fold it in half to get more of a pillow effect, but my grandson thought it was great. We were able to get the pillow into the waterproof duffel bag with the sleeping bag. I was pleased with the product."
2,Boring and uninteresting,"This was my first, and only, book by Maron and if this is an example of her work, deliver me. The Editorial review can't even get the thing correct. Sigrid had nothing to do with the special therapy dolls, that was the crazy psychologist whose name I have already forgotten. A Greenwich Village dancer was brutally killed in front of a roomful of people and it took Sigrid some few hundred pages to figure out who was the killer, even though it had to have been one of about 6 of her coworkers. Combined with this murder is the unsolved murder of a little girl, killed some months before, apparently by someone in this same theatre group. Don't read it unless you have to."
3,Different from what I expected,"This game is basically an America themed Monopoly game. From the description, I had expected a game that taught about the country and traveling from coast to coast. While I was disappointed in the game and would not have purchased it had I know it was just a themed Monopoly game, my sons enjoy playing Monopoly, so it was a fun twist on the original for them."
4,Dorob,Great story but style of writing makes it a little hard to follow. The reader can only tell who is thinking or speaking by carefully watching the quotation marks and that slows down the story.
3,A Good German Let Down,"After having read The Good German I was expecting something better. I found this story to be full of twists and turns which, in themselves, would be alright except they tend to confuse. The plot is a bit thin and I'm not sure its plausible. Sorry to say but Alibi misses the mark."
3,Kanon Fires a Blank,"I have greatly enjoyed Joseph Kanon's earlier works, and was very much looking forward to reading his latest. The setting for the novel was very promising, but in the end the story just failed to deliver. The plot stalls out and gets repetitive for long stretches while the main characters bemoan (over and over) the mess they have made for themselves. In trying to describe why the book largely failed, all I can say is that I just was not captured by the story, and came very close to putting the book down for good several times. Unlike Kanon's other books, which left me wanting more, I was just happy to finish this book so I could pick up something else.Not a bad book - I give it a 3 - just not a very good one either."
3,no alibi needed,"Writing as smooth as silk, transports to post WW2 Venice. It is always interesting. sets his scenes very well and is quite a fresh tale, Will play well as a movie"
3,so-so,"Kept waiting for the big twist - and it just wasn't there. The descriptions of Venice were wonderful, fast read, but something was missing - no surprise that really ""wow-ed"" the reader."
2,implausible,"According to the book jacket (so I'm giving nothing away), post-war Venice is mysterious and then there is a murder. Well, the book is wonderfully subtle and rich, and then there is a murder that is so rediculously implausible that, one-third of the way through the book, I simply stopped reading it. If the author can make characters do ANYTHING, then the idea of ""character"" is lost, then you may as well have aliens as the ultimate source of the problem."
2,"Kanon's a great writer, but this book didn't cut it","Kanon's use of fiction and non-fiction is very intriguing (see all of his past books), but I feel like he had too many characters/story lines to finish this book. The characters had too many inner demons, too many secrets and not enough development. Hell, he could of split this story up and written three books.In the end, I just found this story unbelieveable."
2,"Venice romance, mystery - but book drags","I have really enjoyed Kanon's other novels, but this one just dragged on and on. The character building was good and as usual the history aspect of his novels was very interesting, after the war in Venice, the things people do to survive, but this story just dragged along. I agree with the other reviewer, I just wanted it to end so I could move on to something more interesting, like a Donna Leon novel."
3,Post-War Venice and Moral Dilemmas,"Venice 1946. Adam Miller upon finishing his time in the military as a Nazi war criminal investigator goes to Venice where his mother is living as part of the well to do expatriate community. There Adam meets Claudia a mysterious and beautiful Italian Jewish woman who has survived the camps. He also learns his mother has become engaged to Gianni, a respected Venetian doctor from a highly regarded Venetian family. Adam believes Gianni is a fortune hunter. Claudia believes he is a war criminal responsible for the death of her father. Is one or both of them correct? After Gianni is murdered moral questions lead the reader through the wartime labyrinth of deceit and betrayal behind the beautiful facades of Venice. The first half of the novel is taut and compelling. Venice immediately following the war is a fascinating setting. But after the murder takes place the novel stalls and disintegrates into a muddle quite difficult to follow."
3,WHY???,"The Alpha release of this Chesterfield chestnut is OK. I would say it is about par for the course for Alpha, meaning that it looks like a transfer from a VHS copy. There is a new wrinkle, though: Alpha has started placing a translucent logo in the top right hand corner of the picture during the credits. I did not see it at any other time during the movie."
2,Terrible,"This music is awful. The almost literal quotes from Holst in the Overture are wretched.How anyone can compare this to Goldsmith, Bernstein, et al is beyond comprehension.Tripe."
5,A Triumphant Trek Score Reminiscent of the Glorious Star Trek Finale,"Wow, this score brings a tear to a Trekkie's eye. It's beautiful, futuristic, haunting and most of all thematic and bold. Cliff Eidelman has proven he can compose with the likes of Horner and Goldsmith by writing and conducting a score that breaches beyond the everyday into the further reaches of musical immortality. If you love this score as much as I do, you will also love Horner's ""Wrath of Khan"" and perhap even more so Goldsmith's ""Star Trek, The Motion Picture"" or ""Insurrection.""If listening to true Star Trek music hits you buttons in just the right way, you will need to add this score to your collection, it really is worth it."
4,Excellent score from a relative youngster,"This score is not the equal of Goldsmith's masterwork for the original ST movie (few will ever be) or Horner's great work for ""ST III"" (better than his soundtrack for ""ST II""), but it was an amazing effort for a 24-year-old and far, far better then Rosenman's dreadful (and inexplicably Oscar-nominated!) ""ST IV."" The terrific opening march sets the tone for what is easily the darkest of all ST scores. (And in response to the earlier poster who felt he ripped off Holst's ""The Planets,"" director Nick Meyer asked him to make an opening that resembled ""Mars, the Bringer of War,"" so don't knock him for doing so.) This soundtrack won't blow you away, but it is marvelous work for one so young and it still puzzles me that it didn't advance him to the big leagues like Horner's breakthrough effort for ""ST II"" did for him. Buy it!"
4,"Recycled music, but still good.","Let me start off by saying that this remains my favorite score when it comes to Star Trek films. I think it outranks all others, which is considerable if you think about the talent that has gone into the Star Trek license over the years.The music in the film matches the film perfectly, and I think it goes to director Nicholas Meyer for being able to choose his composers wisely so that the perfect score will be played during his films (The remaining question to be asked is why isn't he directing EVERY star trek film? ).Something that is lost in all of this praise however, is the remarkable similarity to Holst's The planets suite. Someone once told me that Meyer had wanted to use the suite itself in the film but couldn't get the rights. Whether that is true or not, I don't know.In the end however, this is still a piece of music that's fun to listen to. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes orchestrial scores."
5,Melamine egg dish,"LOVE IT! Eggcellent condition, great low price, very durable, holds 12 egg halves, fits into our cabinets nicely. Will not break. Cannot say enough good things about this item!"
4,"Not as good as earlier albums, but an achievement anway.","Something Beautiful seems to describe the album perfectly -- not everything is beautiful, but a song or two is worthy of a spot on the inevitable greatest hits album that Great Big Sea will no doubt one day produce. The rest are all right: standard GBS fare, but nothing especially wonderful compared to their earlier work.Those songs that stole the album, though, are some of the best I've seen Great Big Sea produce: most notably ""John Barbour,"" an adaptation of an old English ballad, and ""When I Am King,"" a catchy song in the upbeat style of Up's ""Run Runaway.""Something Beautiful is not Great Big Sea's strongest album by any stretch, but it's still a worthy collection."
3,Still love them.....,"Although this is my least favorite of their cd's to date, I absolutly still love Great Big Sea! The energy in their live performances exceeds any expectations. You cannot go to one of their concerts and have a bad time.Let it Go and Sally Ann are my personal favorites. None of the songs are bad, it just seems a bit more mainstream than their others.Don't fret though, they will have a traditional cd out soon enough!"
2,What Happened,"This cd has let me down greatly.There are 3 good songs on this cd, Beat The Drum, Helmethead, John Barbour.Who are these guys trying to be,just be Great Big Sea. There is enough pop bands that just try to write hits. The boys from newfoundland have forgotten what has made them popular. I must say Helmethead is awesome but i don't buy a cd for a couple of good songs.Most of the songs are boring and slow. Sally Ann,Summer and i could go on are just brutal.Go back to what people love about GBS, good ol party tunes.There is enough bands writing about world affairs,the band is out of its element."
5,Something Beautiful is Something Else,"This is the first Great Big Sea CD I have purchased and am very glad I did. The majority of the songs are super with ""When I am King"" and ""Love"" being my two favorites. Great songs for getting the heart rate up at the gym or just to get you into a good mood. Highly recommended."
4,Their name fits,"Personally, I call them the ""Goofy Newfies"", because of their quirky humor and rocked out take on the trads. They're definitely back on their game with this CD. Could have stood a few more traditionals here, but ""Something Beautiful"" is a very upbeat and listenable CD.Probably my favorites are ""Helmethead"" for its wry humor and ""Beat the Drum"" because it's a wonderful anthem of youth. And isn't ""Love"" grand? It's definitely more real than most of the syrupy stuff you hear."
5,Dynamcis of Fluids in Porous Media,The item came as advertised in the posting and within one week of the placement of the order. Great job and thanks!
3,Complicated,"This book was not easy to read for me. Takes too many words and formulas to explain simple concepts. But I'm not an engineer, maybe engineers will find it delightful."
3,Wrong Hitch,Great fit and installed in 15 min. Only problem is they sent the wrong hitch. Ordered the ClassIII but was sent the ClassII. No big deal because I am only pulling a jetski with it.
1,Did not come with packaging!,The hitch was delivered in its bare metal form with absolutely no packaging whatsoever for protection. The screws were shoved into the receiver hole and taped in. The fedex shipping label was adhered directly to the metal. Luckily the scrapes/damages were minimal but it could have been much worse.I haven't even installed it yet but my satisfaction is already compromised upon delivery.
3,Holes were wrong,"This item fit right into place. However, one of the bolt holes was off, so I was not able to put that bolt in. My only plan for the hitch is to haul my kid's bikes around on a bike rack, so I'm not too worried about the one missing bolt."
2,Holes did NOT line up. Had to be modified,"The Curt Manufacturing 13561 Class III Receiver is supposed to fit a 2003 Honda Odyssey. However, 2 of the holes did not line up with the holes on the vehicle. I had to have a professional make it fit by drilling out 2 of the holes on the receiver. In addition, the holes on the vehicle had to be re-tapped. He also recommended that this receiver NOT be used to tow anything heavy (i.e. a trailer). Lucky for us we are just using it for a bike rack. The price is good. But, you get what you pay for."
3,Nice hitch. Not so easy to install though.,"I purchased this hitch for our 2004 Odyssey. It did not bolt directly up. First I had issues with 6 years worth of dirt and rust built up in the nuts that are to receive the hitch, not the hitch manufacturers fault but a pain none the less. Then the hole locations in the hitch did not quite match up the the holes and nuts in the frame on my van. So on day two of the install I had to use a burr tool in a die grinder to ream out the holes enough to fit the van frame. Not too happy. But the end result is good none the less."
1,Don't buy if you live in a cold climate,"Every winter I loose a couple of the hooks as they can't handle weight in cold conditions. I live in NH and in the winter it can get a little cold. Most of the time the garage is about 40-50 degrees but when I need to do work outside and keep the doors open it can get a little colder. In these conditions, the plastic hooks will break when you try to hang anything from them. I would not buy these again."
5,An easy to use storage unit,My husband purchased two of these for our new home after being satisfied with the same type in our previous home. It's easy to use and durable.
1,Doesn't last! Breaks too easily!,"Worked well when we first installed it, but after just one year, two of the hangar-clamp units broke. I called the company and had a somewhat difficult time convincing them to send a replacement unit, but they finally did. Another year later and THIS one has had a problem with the rubber/plastic coating on the hooks splitting and tearing apart, which makes the hooks useless! Yes, it gets hot in our garage in the summertime, but didn't the manufacturer consider this? Oh well, another sorry Chinese item!"
4,best value available,"Product + Price cannot be beat. Comparing to the products at Lowes & Home Depot, you get much more hanging power with this one vs the pricy ones at HD/Lowes. HD/Lowes have really good ones but the cost is about $8 per hook."
2,hooks break and can't be replaced,The rack is relatively easy to install and garden tools hang easily and reasonably securely. But the hooks tend to break (the backing of the hooks is just cheap plastic) and despite much searching I have been unable to find replacements. I ended up buying a whole new unit and using the hooks as replacements.
1,A poor value,Don't buy this product. The hooks will break over time and you'll have a useless wall hanging. Maybe it's a cold climate issue- not sure- MICHIGAN
5,SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY'S BEST ALBUM YET!,"Up until now, ""Hearts of Stone"" has been Southside Johnny's definitive work. But, ""Better Days"" has surpassed it by far! This is a comeback album with a vengeance! Southside's cool, and the Jukes are hot! Seen him on the 1991 Better Days tour in Pittsburgh, and he blew us away! If you're into horn-driven rock with some blue-eyed soul, you gotta hear this one!"
4,It's been a long time ...,"This is Southside's best work since ""Hearts of Stone."" The quality of the songs is good to excellent. ""It's Been a Long Time"" is as good as anything SSJ and the Jukes have ever done. And ""Shake Em Down"" is as rousing an album-closer as I've heard. Also, the guest artists make noteworthy contributions: Steve Van Zandt and Bruce Springsteen on ""It's Been a Long Time"" and Jon Bon Jovi on ""Workin' Too Hard,"" among others. This isn't my favorite Southside cd, but its not far behind. This one was good enough that Time Magazine noticed it and gave it a very positive review when it was released."
5,Holy Bible: New King James Version Old and New Testament,"This goes over and beyond. I have two children whom are LD (Learning Disabled) and I got this DVD mainly for them to listen to, Now i can be assured that they are truly learning the word of GOD, becuase they have trouble reading any book, now they talk bible with me, so if anyone has LD children and you want them to learn the word this is a must in any christian library, I LOVE THIS and also with eight kids I can afford this"
5,NKJB A Wonderful Bible to watch and read and listen to,I had finished reading the whole bible the NIV version and wanted more so this was a real treat. The voice reading the scriptures and the scriptures on the TV screen is wonderful. The reading goes by fast it seems all because he doesn't get messed up on any words like I do by myself. This makes reading the bible OHHHHHH so much more fun and enjoyable.Praise God they have made this DVDGod BlessL.Moore
3,good one to have,I received the NKJV bible on dvd with in 5 days. I put it on and was not disappointed. I would recommend it for the price I paid
2,Had high hopes for this book but it didn't deliver,Skillful questioning is a key to high-level selling. This well known truth that caused me to buy this book hoping it would further my knowledge base.I found it poorly organized and very very hard to read. At the end of the day it wasn't worth the money I spent.
5,Outstanding,"This book articulates the art of qualifying customers extremely well. This isn't a book to just ""pep you up."" It's book that will enhance your technical skills."
3,Good Reference Book,This book is great for Sales beginners and a good guide for seasoned salesmen. I will certainly use it as a reference book but doubtful to re-read. Its a good book to have read and it deffinetly gets you thinking about how to engage and uncover more from your potential clients.
5,powerful tool,It helped me to understand the power of asking good questions and how I can be in control of the sales process more completely.I landed a big account that I have been working on for almost a year. I was able to ask the right questions and open doors that had been previously shut.I found the book insightful and a money maker for me.I highly recommend this book to increase your sales.
3,Papo better for female figures,"Schleich is FAR superior to Papo for these figures, but their female items are limited (THE ONLY QUEEN IS ON A HORSE). This items fits into mix pretty well, but painting quality can't hold a candle to Schliech (white blob on her shoulder) and no shading or complexity of tones for realism. Still a nice option for standing queen. List price on these Papo items totally bogus (discount inflated)."
5,Ut Grandma,Appreciate the quality and the detail on these figures. The grandkids will love playing with all of their fairytale characters.
2,Dead sounding,"I thought I'd save some money with these strings, but they are so lifelessthat I'm taking them off. Don't waste your money; you get what you pay for.I'm going back to Thomastik Dominant."
3,Great for people who LOVE rings!,"I love the wood used and the look of this box. The ability to hold a large number of rings is great because I'm a rabid collector.Only 2 problems. 1) mandrels are too thick for smaller size rings (which I have alot of - my fingers are little) and larger rings that I wear on my thumb slip around and lay upside down. 2) Also was shocked that cover comes off. I'd prefer hinges that kept it attached.My recommendation for improvement. Include mandrels of different thicknesses. 2 for rings of small size (5 and under), 2 or 3 for larger rings (9-11) and the rest for those middle sizes inbetween.Still, it's great for keeping a quantity of jewelry in a relatively small space. Easily portable also!"
4,Ring case,The case was very nice and well put together. The lock works very good. The only thing I found was that the space for the rings was a little wide for some so it would not hold them in place.
5,Cutting tip,I bought this tip to cut synthetic materials for various projects. Needed something that would seal the weave to stop unraveling. My soldering gun is not a Weller so had to do some minor bending to make it fit but this was no problem. My gun is a 150w / 230w. My quick test was on the 230w setting and this tip works great.
2,Some problems....,"I notice that the majority of reviewers are from the Midwest and wonder if there is a bias.... In any case, I thought that Staggerford had potential... Hassler builds his characters well, but I think the book needs to flow better. The ending... a potentially powerful event... happened so quickly that it didn't have the power to move me as a reader. The shooting was tucked away in an abrupt, awkward narrative. The ending needs work."
2,Story of small town in MN does no credit to small towns,"I had heard such good things about Jon Hassler, I was surprised when I started reading the book and found I had to force myself to continue. The problem I had was that I didn't care about any of the characters. In fact, they really irritated me, and try as I might, I could find no sympathy for any one of them. I had this reaction because the characters are so stereotypical. There is the bachelor schoolteacher, the old maid, the spinster librarian, the principal who is a control freak, etc., etc. The colorless depiction of these characters makes them seem so unreal and it makes the town of Staggerford laughable. While the plot strands certainly had potential, the treatment of the characters made this book unpaltable for me."
3,Beautiful book - Horrible ending,"Wonderful writing, characterization, and wit. It was a lovely story...until the end. Hated the ending. Absolutely hated it. Why do modern authors feel like they need to shock us, pull us off kilter with senseless violence and sadness? Too, too bad."
4,"A practical, easy-to-use resource for minute-taking","The unsung hero of any corporate meeting is the minute-taker, quietly and diligently recording the decisions, big and small, that fuel the engines of business. Minute-taking is not simply the process of scribbling notes on a pad. A skilled minute-taker distills lengthy discussions down to their essential messages, and creates order and harmony from the often discordant process of reaching a consensus. Office communication consultant Joanna Gutmann carefully explains every aspect of the process, from setting up the meeting and distributing the agenda to taking notes and formatting the minutes. You will encounter quite a bit of redundancy if you read the book cover-to-cover, but we believe you will find it to be an indispensable reference if you are assigned to take the minutes."
4,Gives SLRs a run for their money...,I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas 06. She had a small Canon point and shoot that has been great. She wanted something that had more zoom and other features so she could take her photography to another level.This is a great camera! The controls are well placed and easy to use. It has tons of pre-sets for various settings etc. The pictures are very sharp.The only thing that my wife was not sure about at first is the cameras size. She so loved the way the camera works and the pictures it produces that she is willing to live with it's size.I think this camera is going to be a classic - gives SLRs a run for the money.
4,C.L.R James interpretation of Melville's works,"When I first read this book by James, I was preparing to write an essay on Melville and his ""isolatoes."" James gives ample evidence for establishing the reasons why some of the protagonists appear elusive, enigmatic, and, of course, reclusive. I found this text quite helpful in its explanations of why Melville portrayed his male characters the way he chose; perhaps James own exile for passport violations sets up the framework for presenting his theories on the characters he analyzes. The work is a fine read, although the socialist commentary remains controversial."
2,"Flashes of Interest in Otherwise Tedious, Difficult Read","After reading ""The Sparrow"" and marginally liking it, I wanted to pick this up as I heard it answered a lot of questions.Just like the first book, the story is fascinating and unusual, but so difficult to follow and over-written that it is difficult to follow the plot, which is sad as it is worth following.Important events are merely mentioned, things are alluded to that never materialize, and the same images keep showing up over and over that you get tired of them. Yet you can't help but continue as you develop a fondness for the main characters and want to find out what happens.Had this been better written, it would have been an extraordinary read with images and characters that would stay with you for a long time. But the difficulty of getting through it negates the good points."
5,"An Intelligent, thought provoking tale","I loved this book and The Sparrow, which is the first book in this series. The characters live and breathe with humanity and humor. The spellbinding plot is never predictable. It often left me thinking about the nature of faith, the limitations of our understanding and assumptions about individuals and cultures different from our own, and the unforseen impact that our actions may have upon others."
3,"Good, but not great conclusion to The Sparrow","Children of God isn't nearly as intriguing and inspiring as The Sparrow. Still, I enjoyed the closure it brought to the original story. I found the chronology of the story very confusing and difficult to follow. No question though that Mary Doria Russell is an author worth reading, even when she's not at her best."
3,A bit of a letdown,"I really enjoyed The Sparrow, so I had high hopes for this book, which didn't quite pan out. The author relies on the same general story-telling device--two separate time frames interwoven, telling different parts of the same story--but to nowhere near the effect of the first. It's still definitely readable--and I'd even venture to say that it's better than a substantial chunk of sci-fi (though I read a lot of sci-fi, I recognize that a good number of authors in the genre aren't particularly skilled), but it certainly reads as a sequel, not as a planned plot development."
2,Quite Disappointing,"I found this sequel as bad as I found the first book good. It was unrealistic, rambling, too many minor characters, too predictable, and altogether tedious to slog through."
5,Another Fantastic book by Mary Doria Russell,"I loved this book, very insightful and beautifully written, Thank you Ms. Russell for taking me on this journey with you."
4,A fine follow-up,"Russell continues to grow as a writer in this sequel to The Sparrow. Children of God brings different sets of themes and issues into the milieu of Rakhat. Once again the characters are a strength of the work, and I particularly like the way Russell develops the linguistics angle in her work. The involvement of the Italian underground is far-fetched, and the church politics that were used to justify the return trip and the return of Sandoz to the scene of his humiliation and loss of faith were unnecessarily contrived. But the deft handling of time and the ethical and survival problems that take place on Rakhat are fascinating and engaging. In many ways, Russell is for me like Heinlein--when I think back on their stories I can think of a multitude of things to criticize, but when I am reading their work I enjoy every page. I think this must be a sign that I'm under the spell of an excellent story-teller."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"If you loved ""The Sparrow"" - the stunning predecessor to this sequel - this book will disappoint you. The philosophical depth of ""The Sparrow"" is missing, as this novel simply presents unnecessary factual resolutions to matters left open and a bit mysterious in the first book. Life is like that - no pat endings - so the first book stood on its own. Read this only if, like me, you became wrought up in the characters in ""Sparrow"" and - unlike me - do not mind a reduction in quality."
2,Disappointing Sequel--or is it a Prequel? or a Trequel?,"Somebody give this lady a Paxil! After her wonderful book, The Sparrow, I really looked forward to the Children of God. It was so disjointed and frenetic I found myself reading and rereading, trying to figure out what came next. Or last. Or whatever. The Sparrow skipped back and forth in time, but with a stately grace from chapter to chapter. Children of God had no grace at all. Where was Ms. Russell's editor, anyway? And of course, now that Emilio knows 17 languages, he still only knows two expletives, both in English, when the same two words/phrases are at least more rhythmic and elegant sounding in French and Spanish and much more comical sounding in German. And he uses them, it seems, on every page<Yawn>. I'm so sorry that this much potential was wasted on a rushed-through-and-got-to-market-quick sequel. This was a multi-Oscar winning movie followed by an ABC movie of the week."
1,Hardly a masterpiece,"I read The Sparrow and was impressed. Children of God, however, doesn't come close at all. The story bounces around so much that I could not keep track of where and when things were happening. I did not finish it. Two Thumbs Down."
3,Children of God,"This book is disappointing. The Sparrow was a gripping book filled with likable characters doing interesting things. The sequel has far more exposition and far less action--twenty years of a civil war is condensed into a conversation between two minor characters. This book is more about the politics of the planet than the struggles of the characters. I was also surprised that a book titled Children of God would have so little to do with the religion of the people of Rakhat. The customs of society are shown in detail, but the beliefs concerning their deities only mentioned in passing.One thing that really bothered me while reading it on my Kindle was the number of typographical errors in the edition--at times it was nearly indecipherable.If you loved The Sparrow, then it's nice to follow up, but be prepared to feel disappointed--the older versions of the characters lack the vitality and passions of their younger selves."
5,Either the first or the second best SF novel I ever read!,"When I read Mary Doria Russell's The Sparrow, I recognized it as the best novel I read in 1996 and the best science fiction novel I had read in 58 years of science fiction. Now I have read the Children of God and am in a quandry. Which is the better of the two? I do not know at this point in time. Is COG as good? Oh YES! But I will need distance and another read of COG before I will able to make a decision. Only fair since I read Sparrow twice. Now if the publisher would come up with a boxed set, I would now longer need to make a decision. Thank you Mary Doria..."
2,consider not reading it,"this is not a bad book. however, the sparrow is a great book, and this one does not do it justice. there are some interesting ideas in it, but all in all i would rather have been left at the end of the sparrow than had this addition to the story. the biggest flaw is the way she takes sandoz to rakhat; also, this book doesn't have the moral weight of the sparrow and the resolution is a little too pat."
3,Try before you buy. I did and I bought it.,"I'm a Catholic going to a Jesuit university who has returned from the typical youthful alienation from organized religion to the (occasionally smothering) embrace of Mother Church. If you're like me you should give this book a try. Its concept is audacious and its behind-the-scenes humor (the Pope and the Father General bargaining over birth control, Neapolitan crime families) appealing. The issues it tackles are ones that compel me: revolution and progress; genocide and liberation from that; and behind it all, the intimation of God's hand ... heck, I'm hooked. How about you? Can't say if you'll like it--but give it a try."
5,Amazing spiritual Journey,"Not much to say, but I loved this book, and the previous book, THE SPARROW. I was moved by Emilio's adventure and how he found his way back to God though loving a woman. As moving , fully imagined and well developed a story as the 2 books told, my only complaint was a small one...you travel for 6 month to a Planet near Alpha Centauri, and NOBODY brings a video camera!"
4,Must-read sequel,"I wouldn't have survived the summer if I hadn't been able to follow up THE SPARROW with this book. Not quite as epic as THE SPARROW, or quite as great a stand-alone novel, but incredibly satisfying as a sequel."
4,an interesting sequel to The Sparrow,"I loved The Sparrow and was looking forward to more about Emilio Sandoz and Sophia Mendez. I liked how we saw how the events of the first book played out in the two characters lives and how they both react to the addition of children to the equation. The sequel is mostly action and is lacking in the spiritual insight of the first novel, but it certainly is entertaining and was overall a wonderful novel."
4,good little pocket guide,"I wasn't expecting such a small book, but it will work well as a pocket guide. The author offers excellent suggestions, helpful hints and beautiful photos. I cannot really know the book's impact until I actually visit the places he suggests, but I feel it will really come in handy. Would definitly buy this book if you are a photo enthusiast and will be visiting the Canadian Rockies."
2,Unsafe product,"I agree with the review by Sarah. All of the lights and prelit items that I saw at the store have the same message. ""Known to cause cancer"" and ""wash hands after handling"" have a negative effect for Christmas joy. We do not let the childern play with the lights and tree but will not allow these items in our home and will not visit others that do. Please preserve our childerns health and happiness for the future.<br /><br />Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all."
5,THE book for the study of the Scottish Wars of Independence,"This is the best book for the study of this pivotal period in Scottish History. Barrow is the foremost scholar of the period and this book is a masterpiece. It covers the period from Alexander III's death in 1286 through to the death of Robert the Bruce in 1329, and is both detailed and also very readable. If you only buy one book on the period, this should be it!"
5,Definitive Biography of Robert the Bruce,"G.S.W. Barrow's exhaustively researched book is the definitive biography of Robert the Bruce, who was King of Scots from 1306 until 1329. It is also the definitive history of the First Scottish War of Independence. And it just may be the best book you'll ever read on the rise of the concept of the ""nation state"" in Medieval Europe ... at least the ""nation state"" as defined by ""the Community of the Realm of Scotland"". Ronald McNair Scott's hagiography of Bruce may be more readable (and it is definitely worth a read), but this more academic work by Barrow is hardly dry, and provides much more depth. No study of Medieval Scotland (or Plantagenet England, for that matter) would be complete without reading this magnificent work."
2,"Hoping for an ethnography, got a labor manifesto",Clearly a book that does not withstand the test of time. Full of horribly dated academic anti-globalization blather and not even a particularly good snapshot of the NYC taxi industry at the time.I highly recommend you skip this one.
5,A very special documentary film on Autism. Deeply touching.,"Unless you have an Autistic child on 'the spectrum', you probably don't know what parents (or other caregivers) have to go through in caring for these wonderful yet demanding children. The joy and pain can be very taxing phyiscally and mentally. Without a doubt, the hardest job in the world is parenting Autistic or other 'special needs' children. The film is about how these kids, with a lot of love and guidance, can 'break barriers' and accomplish surprising feats. In this case, a special mini-musical/play was put together for a group of Autistic kids, who practiced for weeks, then pulled it off! The film is full of ups and downs, and you will empathize and cry as you experience what the parents of these kids do to try and help them."
5,At a glimpse,"This is put together very well, giving an insight as to what children with Autism have to deal with everyday, and that of their parents/families too. Not enough light is shed on the world of Autism, so this is a very important film too. I laughed and I cried, but throughout, I was inspired. A great film."
1,Autism: the musical,"I expected more. As one who is passionate about the use of Arts in therapy and in human development, I wished there was more about the exciting process that the director undertook to work with these young people in the creation of the original musical. This doco's title is deceptive because there is more about the tragic lives of the families than about the actual musical and work. This doco's reviews talked about how uplifting it was and the title implies something more upbeat and inspirational -it left me feeling rather despondent and helpless for those involved. Is this kind of work not really of benefit for this population of young people?? I believe it is...but the documentary didn't actually focus on this."
5,A very special film.,"""Autism: the Musical"" wasn't necessarily something groundbreakingly new, nor was it the most complete view of autism (which can be a great deal worse than what you see in the film), but it was a truly inspired and beautiful vision of hope and understanding. The children in the film are wonderful and the adults cover the whole range of what people can be. If this doesn't deeply touch and affect you, then there is something quite wrong. It's a valuable and important film for everyone to see and I applaud its production."
3,It's okay,"There's no denying that Wolfmother have talent. To harken back to the glory days of big blues-riff rock is not a bad thing either. It just seems that there are far too many of these guys out there now. Bands like Gov't Mule have been holding this candle for far longer and really bring the classic heavy to their music. Plus, for newer stadium/space rock, nobody beats Amplifier's debut of a few years back, and that album has a ton more originality to it while still paying respect to the greats. I guess I would like to see this band become something more than just another retread."
4,Pink Floyd and Deep Purple Rolled Into One (!!!),What more can I say???The World needs more bands andmusic like this.Best fresh Rock'N'Roll since Lenny Kravitz.Bloody Brilliant!!
4,Not Bad!,"Nothing real original here, but it's nice to see the younger Generation Embrace Classic Rock. Pick it up, it's one of the top releases so far this year."
2,Hated 'em before I knew who they were,"A friend recommended this to me because I told them I was listening to stuff like The James Gang and Creedence lately. So I checked it out, and as soon as the first song started, I recognized them as the band whose songs have been in some really annoying commercials from the past year or so. Some of the instrument work is catchy, but those annoying Jack White Jr. vocals simply will not stand. The line is drawn here.If albums were people, 'Wolfmother' would be the 90 lbs. weakling at the beach. 'The Pleaser' (Harvey Milk's 1997 opus) would be the strapping muscle-bound bully that comes along and kicks sand in his face and steals his girlfriend. If you really want to hear a younger generation channeling the spirits of the original 70s Rock Demigods, check out The Pleaser. Please."
2,no title,"The awkward, unattractive scream at the beginning of Dimension sums up the quality of this CD.There may be a few good moments on the disc, but I agree with the dissenting reviews in that this album does injustice to many well-respected, pioneering acts and is not up to par with other music in this genre.If Mother gets stuck in your head, buy that song from iTunes and resist the temptation to buy the whole album."
1,"If you want SABBATH,HEEP,ZEP,PIE.....","This band sounds like they're trying to bring the seventies back in a contrived manner----you can't recreate those early masterpieces. Every song is as boring as the next--save your money and get it off the net and then listen to it--more than likely after one or 2 listens it's going to hit the delete bin. Back to my title---if you want those bands just buy their albums and enjoy the real deal.Look at it this way---the original LEVI'S 501 was made a certain way in the good old days in the USA--they've cut costs and farmed it out to China,Bangladesh,South and Central America---The fabric and quality and fit is not the same---we will never get that original 501 back---Zep/Sabs/HumblePie/Heep/Purple mkI//II /Floyd/Bad Co./Free/GFR---they're never coming back as we all knew them circa 1970-75!!!!For an updated and fresh sound try out PORCUPINE TREE!!"
2,Hacks with Overwrought Lyrics,Copying Led Zepplin wasn't cool when Whitesnake did it. Wasn't cool when Great White did it. Wasn't cool when Kingdom Come did it. Why suddenly is it so cool that they guys are doing it? They sound more like Jack White of White Stripes with cheesy Dungeons and Dragons lyricizing.
3,Fine 70's Hard Rock,"It is not often these days that you can exactly describe a band but in this case you can: Jack White/Robert Plant singing tributes to Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull and assorted (mostly) 70's hard rock bands.It's finely played and produced stuff if you don't mind the derivative nature of the material - 'Apple Tree' sounds like it is stolen directly from a White Stripes album.It's good riff-oriented rock'n'roll if you don't mind the fact that you have heard it all before. A great live act."
3,It's not on par with the comparisons,"This is a fairly good album. It's being compared to Led Zeppelin, however, and that's just wrong. If any band from that era, they sound like Budgie. But maybe Budgie without the songwriting edge that made bands like Metallica cover them."
5,Fantastic new group,"I picked this up when I was in London recently and loved it right away. Personally I think they sound like Sabbath, The doors, and Zeppelin, but they also have their own style, and a unique new sound that is a throwback to the 70's rock bands."
2,Stairway to Paranoid,"This band is so influenced by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath they might as well haved named themselves ""Black Zeppelin"". The singer should just admit he's imitating R. Plant.That being said, it's not horrible. It's fun to listen to.. as long as you know that you're gonna hear Black Zeppelin on every track......Except for the inexplicable 2 song departure from the rest of the album:The track ""Apple Tree"" sounds so much like the White Stripes, I think they stole Jack's notebook-- and right after that ""Joker & the Thief"" which sounds like: if Jack White & the Who made a song together. The opening is such a ripoff of ""Baba O'Riley"", I'm surprised they're not being sued by the Who.Other than that... Black Zeppelin... not bad, nothing original.*By the way, if Zeppelin & Sabbath never existed, there would BE NO Wolfmother."
2,"At it's price, the painting on the cover is cool!","First off, had this album not been in the ""used bin"" and sporting a very cool painted cover that made me recall the wild artwork of 70's Miles Davis, I would not even be on here to review it.Musically this disk sounds sepia-toned through the retro ""Orange Amplifier production filter"" courtesy of some producer whom might be living vicariously through these young lads, a la Lou Pearlman. Lyrically this is cotton candy, style over substance fashion-rock with some modern Strokes-attitude thrown in. Collectively it lacks the teeth of their retro-inspiration.I reccomend the first two Monster Magnet disks to anyone looking for a fresher band that pulled off these influences successfully. If you want to dive even deeper into more respectable waters, look into the Obsessed, St. Vitus and a band called Sleep..."
1,horrible,"horrible , ameturish, sophomoric, this band and their fellow neighbors jet are BULL*@*@ I dont know how bands that take their influences and do nothing with them get away with it. Theres no inspired writing here, just take a band you love and sound like them...I cant believe how horrible this band is and people respect it. Every single artist has influences but to take them point blank and present them as something new is distasteful and disrpectful...too make matters worse, they cant play. I feel like Im listening to a high school band at the talent show covering their fav sabbath song who could mess up and have to start over at anytime....Beware of this garbage"
2,One of the better CDs out,"All I can say is that the Led Zeppelin rang and they want their album back.Not the most original CDs out but definantly one of the better ones to be released this past year, worth a look if you like blatant plagiarism."
2,yikes on those vocals,"I can sum up my review in four words:Music okay, vocals hideous.A longer review would consist of my stating that listening to the singing on this album makes me want to run and hide and forget that recorded music ever existed."
2,Wolfmother: Good for some; boring for others,"Wolfmother really really wants to be Led Zeppelin....and Black Sabbath...and Deep Purple...and Jethro Tull....but what they really are is...Uriah Heep.Clearly derivative of Seventies (what used to be called) ""Heavy Rock"", Wolfmother sounds like Black Sabbath on the first song, Led Zep on the single ""Woman"", Deep Purple on another track, and so on. One track even has a flute like...shudder...Jethro Tull.Ultimately though, they bore like the worst of Uriah Heep.If you own all the great Seventies ""heavy rock"" albums, you may find a lot to like in Wolfmother.If you are new to the Seventies rock sound, go out and get Led Zeppelin IV, Deep Purple's Machine Head, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, or anything else from that era first."
3,What's new?,"They enjoy playing it and people seem to enjoy listening, which makes everything alright. After all, imitation is the highest form of flattery, it is said. I just hope the original bands from the early '70s eventually get their due royalties from the Wolfmother."
3,We'll see what happens.,"We all know who they sound like. It's obvious where their influences come from. Let's just hope they continue to develop their sound into something further...into something that doesn't sound like a Zepplin/Sabbath mix. I agree, these guys have the potential to be stadium rock gods...but their general lack of originality just makes me want to listen to my Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin originals. Not trying to hate on them...they're just not blazing any trails. This music has been heard before. That said...they do sound good. It does rock...but it is NOT original."
3,A talented band with no identity,"I give the band three stars just for the fact that, in this day and age, a new band could be this talented. There aren't many bands out there I like anymore, but Wolfmother have definite potential.My problem, like many other's, is the fact that they try emulating the sound of many classic rock bands (Zeppelin and Sabbath come immediately to mind, although there are dashes of Deep Purple and Jethro Tull in there). They really have no identity, and they don't really try. Maybe it's their first album and their next one will be a collection of Wolfmother songs. Until then, what we have is a band that sounds exactly like the classic rock bands we love.Then again, for some, that's not bad. Who said catchy rock isn't good? It's great to have a catchy rock song, but if you want to use influences, at least use them to build your foundations on, not to sound and play exactly like."
3,"Decent,but wears thin...","I don't know what I was looking for on this. I saw the vid for ""Woman"" & thought it had a 60's feel. I heard a snippet of ""Love Train"" and thought it had a cool vibe. I agree with the positive and negative reviews simultaneously,hence my rare middle of the road 3 star rating.I don't love it, I don't hate it. I appreciate it for it's stripped down bare bones appeal (think AC/DC,White Stripes,Ramones). However, it really did wear thin after a few listens. I guess I'm being too hard on it but I have to be honest. I am writing this to tell people to be wary of this; it's neither as good or as bad as people say."
4,better than a root in the dunny,i actually got goosebumps listening to a few of these songs. then i saw the album cover and i lost it. it's about time someone dug the warlocks and forest pixies out of retirement and blasted them with some powerchords with the fury of a 20-sided die. rock on chaka kahn!!
4,That's the way rock is supposed to be rocked!,"If Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep somehow managed to have a bastich son... wait! They already have! It's called WOLFMOTHER!Great rock and roll in the 70's tradition, just like new bands like Cavalar, Wicked Minds and Black Bonzo are following. Highly listenable."
4,Bringing back Great Rock and Roll,I listened to the song Mother on Jimmy Kimmel and I thought I was hearing Uriah Heap all over again.
2,Expected More,'Woman' is a good/screaming rocker...other than that I can't say that I was too impressed by this album. Another dust collector in my collection.
3,3 1/2 stars,"not a bad recording.A better band than 99 percent of whats out there now.Still there is not a solid band that i can say i really love that didnt start off in the 60's or 70's.music went down hill fast in the mid to late 80s,90's and 2000's.This band is good but wont bring real rock n roll back.To me just not original enough,but like i said still better than most of whats out there.and this is to people who master cds!Why make the cd so loud that you lose all the dynamics?I hate listening to a cd that the sound is at the same volume all the time.cds have a dynamic range of 96db,lets use it!"
4,thanks for the strong recommendations,"After cross referencing a number of albums I was led to Wolfmother. Initially, I had little interest but there were so many strong reviews that sounded like they just might be of interest to an old guy from way back when. I took a chance and I now feel like I have ""discovered"" a ""new"" band that is currently rocking me down the road. I have just ordered my next Wolfmother. For those that criticize them for being too heavily influenced by artists from the past, whats your point?"
5,new favorite album,"Theres gonna be a lot of people out there who are going to criticize the hell out of Wolfmother for being too 70's and 60's retro rock, but if thats the kind of music you like and listen too especially Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin like me, then you are going to love Wolfmother like i did, i probably wouldn't have bought this album if i hadn't heard 'Woman' first and wanted to know what the other songs were like and immediately got hooked. This is a MUST HAVE for any classic rock enthusiast. The lead singer has amazing vocals and he can turn simple guitar licks into legendary riffs and his two other band mates which include the drummer, who has a superb sense of rhythm and can tear up the drums along with the bassist who is an accomplished synthesizer player as well. Like i said, its a MUST HAVE for any Led-Head or early Sabbath fan, go ahead and buy it and be pleasantly surprised."
3,Impulse buy,"It was an impulse buy because I heard their single and thought they must be geniouses. Lo and behold, they're still yeomans in the art of rocking it. They're NOT the new Led Zeppelin - just a weak mix of Wite Stripes and Mars Volta with a large dose of ""my dad's garage"" rock. All and all, pretty good, but I got my hopes up for something great."
4,mother of a wolf,"Look, solid blues rock has pretty much vanished. As a result, lovers of the genre will eat up ANYTHING by a new band that is similar in style or sound to Zeppelin or Deep Purple. Regardless of the cheese factor associated with singing about mythology and ripping off LZ(which is why it gets 4 instead of a 5...), this Wolfmother band is pretty tight. Bottom line is I like this. You will also."
5,Wolfmother - self-titled (Universal),"Review no. 216. Took me awhile to land a copy of this stellar first CD by Wolfmother - the (seemingly) premier 21st century Australian alternative metal trio. Key tracks here include ""Dimension"", the power-house ""White Unicorn"", ""Joker And A Thief"", ""Pyramid"", the total ass-kicking ""Witchcraft"" and somewhat 'funky' ""Love Train"". Personnel: Andrew Stockdale - guitar & vocals, Chris Ross - bass & keyboards and Myles Heskett - drums. Band's obvious influences are Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, MC5 and Kyuss. Long time / serious fans of Mastodon, Monster Magnet maybe Soungarden, Boris and Ozzy-era Black Sabbath will likely eat this title up. I wasn't aware that Wolfmother had just two CD's out, as I haven't heard 'Cosmic Egg' yet. Highly recommended."
3,Already been done,"Not that its a bad CD, but if you've heard the Datsuns, Jet, The Darkness, and the Hard side of the White Stripes, then you've heard this one. Like the Datsuns, this is heavy without a lot of substance or creative riffs. Wolfmother could develope into great things if they evolve their own sound and break away from the pack. Again, not a bad CD. If you haven't heard the bands listed above, this will probably sound ground breaking to you."
5,Best rock album of the past 2 decades!,Not a mediocre or bad song on it! This is where 70's metal should have gone instead of glam rock in the 80's.
5,"Good as the ""classics""","Having grown up with Sabbath, Grand Funk and Zeppelin music back in the seventies I lost interest in the eighties when rock music seemed to lack any excitement. But after listening to Wolfmother I have to say that this is the best music I have heard since those days. Truly exciting, familiar and original at the same time. Great stuff !"
4,These guys get it!,"There are a lot of recent retro rock bands coming and going, but if this album is any indication, Wolfmother will hang around for a while. Unlike many of those other bands, these guys *get* classic rock (like The Darkness *get* glam metal). This disc doesn't just have a 1970 vibe; it really sounds like it came out in 1970. And the songwriting chops are there -- these are memorable tunes, not throwaway riff-rock.Upon first hearing it, I wasn't sure how much staying power this material would have, but the more I listen to it, the more I'm digging it. This stuff rocks!"
4,Not even an IOTA of irony,"If you like Sabbath, Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, T-Rex, Rainbow, and Spinal Tap, you'll LOVE this band. It's good for a game of ""name that riff."" These guys wear their influences on their sleeves, and aren't afraid to talk unicorns."
5,THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!!,"Wolfmother is pure rock n roll! Their main influence is classic rock, and the comparisons are endless, from Black Sabbath, to Deep Purple, AC/DC, Jethro Tull, etc. Example: The single 'Woman' reminds me of Queen's 'Tie Your Mother Down'. Even with the classic rock influence, metal heads should be satisfied, and singer Andrew Stockwell reminds me of Perry Ferrel. These guys are talented musicians and songwriters. This is the most promising band I've heard since Nirvana, and I listen to alot of music. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!"
4,so when will they cover Stairway to Heaven?,"this sounds like a led zep tribute band that made it big. it's as transparently clear as water who their influences are. i'm already waiting for the mandolins and synthesizers. 4 stars because this band is by far better than anything out there today, but this album couldn't hold it's own against 'Presence'"
2,lost some cred... but...,"this bands label treated them to an INFOMERCIAL here during SXSW on late night tv. very strange and definitely lost a lot of points with me for that. not very 'rock and roll.'but, the music is okay. it has its moments. they'll go the way of the vines or the von bondies and nobody will know who the f*** wolfmother is in 2 years time. so enjoy it a few times around for what it is, a throw-away retro rock album."
2,"Overrated, overhyped!","I dunno, just don't get the hype about this band. Yea, they sound a bit like Zeppelin and Purple mixed with the White Stripes, but the songs are boring and repetitive and the lyrices are terrible! It just sounds like obvious 'hipster' ironic plundering to me. If you want to hear this stuff done right, then listen to Zep or the White Stripes. If you want to hear some new bands doing 'retro' type stuff, try The Sword or Priestess, both of whom blow Wolfmother away. Way overrated, don't believe the hype!"
4,Awesome Album,"I bought this album mostly for ""Joker and the Thief,"" one of the greatest songs ever in my opinion, but it has some other treasures, like ""Apple Tree"" and ""Woman."" I greatly enjoy the flute solo in one of the songs."
5,SOME VERY SACRED MUSIC HERE,"Very retro 70's, very heavy and just true rock worship.In the vein of SIR LORD BALTIMORE, BLUE CHEER, DEEP PURPLE, URIAH HEEP, PENTAGRAM, SABBATH, ZEPPELIN, this stuff needs to be in your collection."
5,Wolfmother Review,"If you like Black Sabbath & the 1st. Rush album you will love Wolfmother. Also, The classic Orange amplifier sound on this album is Awesome!!!! Highly recommended. Get it."
3,Wanted Lead Guitarist,"A mostly enjoyable album that sounds like the love child of early Black Sabbath and early Pink Floyd. Spacey but hard with Sabbath like bass lines and slightly more raspy Ozzie-like vocals. However they are missing the most important ingredient that would make this a tasty album - searing guitar solos! There are no true lead guitar parts. Couldn't they find a lead guitarist? I would suggest that these reborn hippies look up one of the great semi-retired lead guitarists of the heyday of the music they seek to recreate. Maybe give Larry ""Rhino"" Rheinhardt or Harvey Mandel a call and I would make this group a regular listen."
5,A message of hope,"I recommend Nancy Clark's new book HEAR HIS VOICE because of the hopeful message it communicates. Nancy's message, from the Light of God, is one of Unconditional Love for all of mankind. The world we all share together can be very difficult and challanging at times. HEAR HIS VOICE encourages us to Listen for the inner guidance that is always available to us. Nancy Clark has a remarkable relationship with God that is available to us all. You don't have to be a Saint, but you do need to listen. You to can enjoy reading Nancy's life story, and about her amazing spiritual experiences, as I have, and benefit greatly from it. All you have to do is listen and you can HEAR HIS VOICE in your heart too."
4,Nice Magnetic Darts,"These are the same as the darts that came with my board originally, and work well. The only negative is that you don't get to choose the color, and the darts that I received are the same as the ones I have (yellow). I was hopeful that I would receive a different color !"
2,Need better description of contents,Didn't came with the case. Not sure it was new or used. Be careful b4 making purchase of similar items.
3,Experienced Users Need Another Book,"This book was well written and provided a large amount of information - but did not cover any advanced techniques. If you have even a little experience with Power Point (or graphic design in general), pick another, more advanced book. You'll be much more rewarded."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"One of the best darwave/synthpop groups out there. They are very hard to find and obscure, a shame! This music is SO beautiful words cannot explain. It make you feel like you are in another world and calm. I know alot of music groups and genres and this group is def in my top 5. dont pass it up and tell ur friends too! so great"
5,Beautiful!,Soothing and beautiful music for babies! I play the music everyday for my unborn baby boy. I think he likes it!
2,Dennis was a Menace---not a very good show,"I don't know if I caught the original series when I was a kid, ie the tale end, or saw most of it in reruns, but all I know is that Dennis the Menace was not a very good show. Dennis really was not that funny, and after awhile, he just was plain irritating. There were far better shows on in the 60s around that time. I was busy watching a GREAT show like The Rifleman while the dweebs were watching stuff like Dennis the Menace. Jonny Quest, animation, but was so much better and more intelligent. Even shows like Leave it to Beaver, Dick Van Dyke, My Three Sons, The Munsters etc blew away Dennis the Menace. And of course later there were the classics like Green Acres, Get Smart, Hogans Heroes, Lost in Space, Beverly Hillbillies. Skip this and get the good stuff."
5,Real [Madrid] - The Movie,"A film for ALL soccer fans, not just Real Madrid's. Hala Madrid!There is another film that all soccer fans would love: it is called ""Historias de Futbol"" but I have never seen it advertised. It comes up on TV's Spanish channels now and then. If you see itm buy it - it is another 5-star production!"
1,Jumbled without direction,"I understand the director's passion for Real Madrid. However, this film was a jumble. It didn't seem to know its identity - Was it a bunch of human stories that all have a common link (e.g. Crash)? Was it a documentary about Real Madrid? If so, about the current team or its history? Was it about one man's quest to answer a question about the team's fans? Rather than making a choice the film includes all these themes - and doesn't do it well. The movie doesn't flow. It skips around without any real sense of direction. Why add the Japanese anime?! The documentary footage is as confusing - bouncing from the current team and its preparations to the team's history from the 1st European Cup. It wasn't until mid-way through the film that SOME cohesion arose, in the timeline for preparation of the upcoming game with Barcelona.I had rented this movie to learn more about Real Madrid. Out of this 90-minute film, what little I did learn was through a very confused, disjointed medium."
1,It's OK but i would not reccomend!,As a Real Madrid Fan i thought i would really enjoy this but i didnt enjoy it as much as i thought i was. I guess i expected more of a documentary where i was going to get to see more behind the scenes footage with players as they prepare for the match or the season.You get what the title says - a MOVIE based on the team with cuts as they train for the macth against Barcelona. The movie was a bit corny and im definatley going to sell this.
2,Depressing,"Maybe I wasn't in the mood for this book, but then I'm not often in the mood to be depressed or to over-analyze relationships and emotions. I found the main character pathetic, her husband annoying in the extreme, and didn't care for her young ""girlfriend"" whatsoever. Or maybe I'm tired of angst-filled self-important lesbian-themed novels that take themselves oh-so-seriously. I slogged through it, but in the end, didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. If this is reality, give me fantasy any day."
5,Spiritual spirits?,"The setting for this cozy paranormal is Cassadaga, FL - a town that sees the paranormal as normal. Lynn is travelling to Cassadaga to visit her aunt, and she is utterly unaware of the town's history or reputation. Upon her arrival, she stumbles onto the scene of a burning building - with a scantily clad gorgeous runner staggering out of it! This is merely the beginning of the mysterious and deadly events that seem to follow Lynn around town, and to the people she meets. But Lynn doggedly pursues the truth, and happens upon an unexpected budding romance - at least, unexpected to her. This is a fun story - and I adore the paranormal. I lived in Florida for 20 years and still never made it to Cassadaga - hopefully I will make it there next trip!"
3,Kindle edition problem,"I have read the first five chapters of the book so far, with some difficulty. In the formatting for the Kindle edition, all of the quotation marks were omitted. (I am assuming that this is not how the book was written). It makes it hard to read when the dialogue just runs into the rest of the prose."
1,Quotation marks?,"So...I requested a sample of the book before buying, natch, and found that there are absolutely no quotation marks around anything the characters are actually saying! I got through maybe ten pages before I gave up entirely. Is the full Kindle version like this? If so, how the heck did it get through the editing process?"
4,Ideal for dancing,"I am so pleased this is available in CD. This CD has a couple of excellent Tahitian otea, a popular aparima, and a classic Hawaiian chant. It is a dancer's CD (and fun to listen to)."
3,interesting and rare John Wayne movie,"This Civil War era movie was very interesting as it tried to follow a generalized campaign of the very infamous Captain Quantrell, the Confederate leader of raiding party's into the North. This was not one of John Wayne's best pictures but it ranks up there as being rare and informative. A must see for true John Wayne fans."
4,movie slut,"no breakage, awesome! these john wayne's are great. early waynes are fun you see him getting better,and better. dark command with roy rodgers, [ HE LOOKED 19] WAS THE BEGINING OF SOMETHING GOOOD. A LADY TAKES A CHANCE was great! if you like the 40's these are great ones. hard to go wrong with john wayne. worth the cash."
3,"DECENT SET OF WAYNE FILMS, BUT NOT IN COLOR","This is a decent set of John Wayne films, although not quite as good as the other similar set. THESE FILMS ARE NOT IN COLOR, as stated in product details. This was a factor in my purchase and disappointing to find out afterwards. This should be corrected. I'd say these are all between two and a half or three star movies, with DARK COMMAND probably being the best."
5,I LOVED IT,"i have the tape and i love ""COMO TE RECUARDO"" me and my boyfriend Roberto broke up and that was our song. One day i was playing it and he started crying and begged me back. Ever since then i have loved that song for bringing MI AMOR back to me."
4,I really enjoy their music,Their songs are really cool. They really know how to express feelings with their music. They are very romantic and I really enjoy most of their songs.
5,In love,"I am in love with this scent. It's perfect. Very light and natural, it smells like a running stream. There is a certain incredible sweetness that I adore! You won't regret this."
3,Good to have,I like the series and it has some very beautiful parts to it. There is also some music which usually works nicely with the passages but sometimes I did not think that it was a good match up. I prefer to read the Holy Bible but sometimes it is nice to watch and listen:)
5,Thank you,"This is being a great way for me to fill my house, mind and heart with the word of the Lord. Also it's a great way for me to hear the peoples names and the names of places pronounced. Thank you"
4,Near Perfect,The menu for this DVD is easy to operate. You can go to books and chapters. It would be nice if you could go to specific verses but that does not lessen my enjoyment. You can easily read the DVD which can be clearly heard as read by the narrator. It is a great gift for anyone of any age who slightly knows how to use a DVD player. The DVD has other great features and would be a great addition to any library.
1,"Let the buyer beware...note the ""not good reviews""","I was very unhappy with this holy bible on dvd. The other reviews that stated these dvd's are read too fast are true. I weighted the pro's vs. con's on this particular criticism, and bought. I should have listened to those that were disappointed. This is all I have to say, except, shame on the publisher of these dvd's. They are really very poorly done!"
3,Good Item to have,"I like having this, however the narrerator spoke too quickly. Its a great thing to have and has everything you would want in a bible DVD, but the narrorater should have been a little slower in his readings."
2,Limited Options for Listener,"I love the voice and drama of Scourby but, you cannot pause, backup or forward. Once you select at the beginning, it is very difficult tochange chapters, reverse, pause or forward.I am disappointed since this makes it unuseful for the morning study Ihad hoped for."
5,excellent stuff,If you want to be saved then this is the book for you!! Go and sin no more and ask for forgiveness....
2,False Expectation!!!,"I bought this to replace the King James Version on dvd I had before. I've only played so far the new testament and I started at the book of Ephesus. I was so happy with the dvd I let it play all the way to the end and let it automatically start again at the book of Matthews. I stepped out of the room for a few minutes, as it started playing Matthew. When I came back into the room to listen, the narrator (Stephen Johnston) was reading abnormally fast! I sat there puzzled, wondering what happen. The previous set that I had never did that before. I don't like this version and also the distributor took almost a month to deliver this. I was happy and excited and did my happy dance when I first receive this, until I reached the book of Matthew. My happiness has now turned to sadness. I will be returning this product."
5,Flawed product,I ordered the Complete King James Version - Old and New Testament for my mother for Christmas. The service was totally unbelievable. It arrived earlier than I had been told it would and a previous confusing order had been deducted from my credit card. However the CD - Old Testament was badly scratched and is really not of any use. I didn't think that there was any sense in calling to complain so I am pleased with this forum.Respectfully
2,could be better!,i wanted this so i could stop it when i wanted to. i also did not want it to run the verses together. not what i wanted.
3,FAST Talking Bible,"Although I am pleased to have the Old and New Testament version of this ""Talking Bible"" at all, the commentator reads it much too fast. One cannot follow and absorb it as one might like -- and needs to. Also, the other voice inserts for quoted sentences are very distracting. It would have been better if the same person had read the entire text him/herself. The Psalms should also have been included in a ""complete"" Bible such as this. I wish Johnny Cash were still here to record the Old Testament and Psalms for us too. His DVD of the New Testament is read at a proper speed and is superior to this version."
2,Item Not Easy to Use,"I did not like this item because I found it difficult to find the books and chapters of the Bible. It seemed that in order to get to the New Testament texts, you had to advance through the dvd. This was too inconvenient for me."
4,BIBLE DVD IS GREAT!,"This is a very good dvd, I just ordered it and watched the first 8 chapters of John. Very telling with background effects. Worth the money."
5,We love it!,"This is a great idea! The only thing like it we have found on the market. Even if you just want an audio bible, for the price this is much better by far and only on one DVD! Only one thing it does not do that I would have liked it to is it will not pause with the verse on the screen. Overall it is a great buy!"
4,BIBLE ON DVD,THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE AN EXCELLENT VALUE ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT YET HEARD THE ENTIRE DVD.
2,Review of Alexander Scourby's narration of the bible,I thought I was buying the Bible experience when I bought this bible narration. I was a bit disappointed but decided to continue listening. There are no background effects. I didn't hear any change in character's voice. Although the narrator changes his mood it doesn't quite add up to the Bible experience. So in conclusion I still have to get the bible experience to make it come alive and interesting.His voice is very interesting but the whole project needs to be reworked in order to make it competitive.
3,"El concepto no esta mal, pero esperaba tal vez un poco mas","El concepto del DVD no esta mal, porque es como leer tu biblia pero desde la comodidad de tu televisor, pero entiendo que el narrador lee demasiado rapido, sin dejar tiempo suficiente a internalizar y reflexionar sobre el mensaje de Dios a traves de toda la Biblia. Intente cerrando mis ojos y limitandome a escuchar lo que el narrador leia, pero aun asi iba demasiado rapido, lo que para mi es lo mismo que leer por leer y la Biblia requiere mucha atencion y sabiduria para evitar falsas interpretaciones. Si el DVD tuviera la opcion de apagar la narracion y poder leer uno mismo, tal vez le hubiera dado mas estrellas."
1,Has great potential,"This item would make a great gift if it were not for the mistakes in the narration versus text. Genesis 24:18 replaces the word ""she"" with ""he"" and Genesis 29:15 leaves out ""And Labon said unto Jacob"". Other errors in Genesis are in verses 36:15, 37:27, 42:5, 43:18, 43:23, and 49:30. I also found 4 errors in the narration of Exodus, 2:2, 17:7, 25:19 and 29:15.I would loved to have handed out many of these DVDs last Christmas but glad I only gave a few out before finding the errors. The content is too important to allow me to give the rest of the DVDs out that I purchased."
2,"nice, but don't like it",I orginally purchase it to read the bible with my children.The music drowns out he vocals.The narator reads too fast for the average reader.The bonus dvd is grainy.All these things was spoken by my children.Now I have to purchase another version and maybe it will be better.
3,the longer I listen the less I like!,"As an adult, I don't feel the need to have different ""voices"" read the parts of some of the ""extra"" characters - not to mention not that great and words missed or changed (I read along). The narrator alone would suffice for me.Other than that it's fine. I'm looking forward, however, to getting to New Testament I bought on CD with James Earl Jones as narrator. I should have listened to some before I purchased - but more than likely would have still bought.It certainly beats the effort I've been making to read the Bible on my own.UPDATE! I've downgraded to a three...the voices are driving me crazy. I just would have preferred the narrator's voice reading the Bible.ALSO - you cannot go back one page or forward by page. You have to go to beginning of each chapter."
5,Holy Bible: Complete King James Version Bible on DVD,Being able to watch or listen while the DVD plays the King Version of the Bible has been great. The narrator does a wonderful job with various voice tones and there are also some sound effects in background. It has been a blessing to be able to move through the Bible with or without reading along and to get the full benefit of the Word. I have ordered extra copies to share with friends and they love the DVD.
3,Reading in Old Testament is to fast,"I actually like this Bible on CD but It was advertised that he (the reader) had redone the bible and slowed down the reading. In the new testament part he did slow down the reading but in parts of the old testament, he didn't. It is difficult to follow his reading in those parts of the old testament especially since there are a lot of names that I wanted to learn to pronounce. I feel like I had been deceived into buying this product because of the false advertisement. If it wasn't for that, I would have given this product at least a 4. I was also expecting to see maps of important places in Israel, which this product did not have."
5,Excellent to have!!!!!,"Oh this is a awesome way to read & learn the Bible and what God is saying!!! I truly going to enjoy This product, a church member has it is good to learn off and get to know and understand the Bible more clearly to me anyway!!!!ThanksAmazon"
5,Beautiful and insightful,Purchased for my father who has a strong interest in the people of India. He loved it. This book focuses on the people rather than the places.
4,Nostalgia as lit crit as sociology,"Marvellous dialectic, this, yet as sentimental as all get-out. Wasn't the Golden Age always at bottom our own responsibility-less infancy?"
4,Subtle writing interlaced with heavy metal riffs,"The first Steve Morse album I bought was Southern Steel. I find this work of his to be more explorative, diverse, and subtle, without so many heavy riffs, but still very satisfying.""User Friendly"" shows off his catchy tunewriting talent, while ""Morning Rush Hour"" is more about the guitar licks. The diversity is shown in songs like ""Runaway Train,"" a solid rockabilly/bluegrass tune, and ""Flat Baroque"" which has a classical feel just as the name suggests.All this backed up by an incredible rhythm section including Dave LaRue on bass makes for a very interesting guitar solo album."
5,Great Sweetner,Love this it has a unique flavor. I will purchase more to keep in stock at home. Love love love this product.Palm Sugar Pure 16 Oz
2,PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES,"IF YOU CARE ABOUT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, PLEASE REMEMBER TO ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR PALM SUGAR SOURCE - IT SHOULD COME FROM THE SAP OF THE TREE, NOT THE FLOWER (AS THIS ONE DOES) The harvest of palm sugar is not a sustainable practice when the sugar is made from the sap of the flower. By sacrificing the flower that would normally become a fruit, one is sacrificing palm products in favor of the sap/sugar. If you do purchase palm sugar, be sure it is certified organic by a reputable third party organization and always read the ingredients labels."
3,Fits well,The case fits well and has all the openings necessary to link your zen to the computer. Downside - no top opening to access volume - you need to open the case to adjust. The quality of the clear plasting inside is heavy but scratched. A little disappointed.
4,"Well-organized, informative, and accessible to all.","The Great Lakes region has some good plant books already in use, noteably Plants of the Chicago Region, the flora bible for many. As a practicing wetland professional I am always on the lookout for references that make my life easier. This book really fits the need, while remaining accessible to non-professionals. By providing wetland habitat descriptions, as well as solid information on each family and species, the book really adds to the discussion of the Great Lakes flora. Illustrations in the book are detailed enough to serve as a diagnostic tool, enabling the careful reader to separate similar species readily by eye, as well as by technical detail, a feature lacking in some other regional plant reference books."
5,Comprehensive AND accessible,"Far more comprehensive than most similar books for the Great Lakes and upper midwest. Considerably more accessible than the typical work with this breadth. It will be an excellent field reference for wetland professionals, plant ecologists and allied disciplines. The drawings are good quality, picking up key differences in appearance among groups such as the sedges - critical for professional users. I look forward t using it on my trips to wetlands in the northern midwest as both casual botanist and plant ecologist."
3,"""Orac"" essential for Blake fans; ""Redemption"" unfulfilling","""Orac"" is a reasonably good tale and continues the story from the previous episode, ""Deliverance."" ""Orac"" is essential viewing for Blake's fans because the final member of the crew is introduced. ""Redemption"" is the first episode from the second season and completes the story started by the cliffhanger ending of ""Orac."" The story is a little disappointing, but demonstrates some of the special qualities of the newest member of the crew. I applaud Terry Nation for taking an entire season to fill out the crew of ""Blake's 7."" It kept me guessing from week to week, wondering when the crew would finally be completed. I think Nation's original vision for the show was brilliant and his execution during the first season was outstanding as he wrote all thirteen episodes himself."
5,Foreigner,"A fitting end to the Quintaglio series, ""Foreigner"" continues the time-compressed scientific progression from the dinosaur equivalent of Galileo to Charles Darwin to the Wright Brothers and beyond human endeavor to interstellar space travel. Well written and interesting, Sawyer once again works his magic and keeps the reader engrossed from beginning to end."
2,Gift for Grandson,"I bought this book for my Grandson, who lives in another state and haven't gotten it to him yet. He has read the others in the trilogy and enjoyed them and requested this one. My only problem was that Amazon sent me two of them and then deducted S&H from my refund because UPS would not take it without my paying the postage. I did not order two, only one. If I had any problems with placing the order, I might have thought it was my fault, but I didn't and don't feel that I should be penalized for Amazon's error."
1,mini amp,This item did not work. I waited to long to return it for refund. I should have returned it immediately.Now I am stuck with a non working product.
4,HP Keyboard,"Great Product! I had a similar one at work so I got this one for my home pc. Comfortable and quiet keys, very nice layout. Much better than the junk that came with my original Dell PC. This is a great keyboard."
1,Beware PS2 connection only!,"This an excellent keyboard, wish it would have worked for me. No meat ion of the connection type in the description. With no PS2 connector on my computer a PS2 x USB connector keyboard won't work. Sending it back."
2,"FOR AMATEURS, BUT NOT FOR A SERIOUS DENTAL PROFESSIONAL","I purchased this book thinking that it would have ample pictures of all the oral diseases that I would encounter in a practice, but I was wrong. This atlas is very limited. A simple STD such as gonorrhea, and some forms of tumors are not included in this book. Its ok for an amateur to purchase, but professionals should not buy this book or at lease not rely on this atlas. On the positive side the book does give explanations and descriptions of what the lesion is such as location, color etc. It also has a SELF-ASSESSMENT QUIZ on appendix IV with 20 questions to test your knowledge. Don't waste your time buying this atlas unless you can't find something better."
4,Color Atlas of Common Oral Diseases,"The text was educational, informative and correlated well with photos. Photos were diagnostic and true to clinical observation. Questions and examples at end of sessions were not always clear as to meaning."
4,Nasty Nuns of Nippon,"I sat down to view this expecting a typical nunsploitation flick. Sure there is some whipping, torture, lesbianism and even some mention of Satan. But this widescreen, uncut version by Cult Epics is an absorbing and gripping story of demons that lurk within the hearts and minds of humans, not beasts of the holy or unholy kind. Medieval Catholicism mixes with Japanese themes of family, honor and revenge to produce a hot mess that is beautifully presented and mesmerizingly performed. Tumi Takigawa stars as Maya, a young woman who ""infiltrates"" a convent to discern the truth about her biological mother, a nun who died after giving birth to Maya 18 years before. She encounters greed, lust, subterfuge, hatred, betrayal, corruption, violence and many other vices while navigating the curious caste system of the abbey that pits ""choir nuns"" against ""assistant nuns"". Although sometimes over-the-top in its depiction of religious beliefs, it fascinates nonetheless."
5,Variety hula music,"This 2-CD item has a collection of many of the classic hula numbers -- probably not the exact arrangement you may have learned to back in the 80's, but it's fun to dance to and to listen to. I recommend it.-Haole Hula Dancer & Teacher-"
5,I Love This Album!,"I WISH that I could still get this wonderful album on CD! It's very frustrating that it's been discontinued! This was JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! Charles Kaipo and His Happy Hawaiians have that traditional, charming sound that reminds me of my childhood. Could you please release it again on CD? I hope so!"
3,don't expect a happy ending,"This novel is set in the 20s but could be present day; Mary and her society friends witness a scandalous, as they think, scene between a friend and a friend's fiance one Sunday morning! The story weaves around this observation with the girls' lessons on life and love no matter the era. It was Jane Austen-like in parts.I was rooting for Mary and her beau but as the book atests, relationships are never simple. The characters were defined well but the end of the story just ended, and left me not as satisfied as I had hoped. Entertaining short read for a cozy afternoon but not one with a tidy ending, beware!"
5,perfect summer read,"I found this book on the table of the bookstore and finished it within a span of two days. I loved it! It's about socialites in the 1920s in New York, and they take a trip to Paris. It's very minimalistic and great. I love the scenes set in Paris. There's a fabulous scene where one of the girls walks the Champs-Elysee and I swear I almost cried. It's like I know the girls. Even though it's the 1920s, I found so many comparisons to today's culture, the way that today we're up against a conservative backlash in the country not unlike prohibition and the way that people still talk behind each other's backs, and the way that things aren't always as they seem. Highly recommend this book!!"
3,Decent Strings,These strings were an improvement over the cheap strings that came on my violin outfit but I'm not too happy with the E I feel it could be better or deeper and perhaps the A a bit also the D and G are nice and warm. Maybe I'll try a different set next time. Decent strings tho on my already trebly viloin.
1,Pro Arte No Bargain,"Bought a set of Pro Arte strings. Installed them on a spare violin, 08/16/12.Last night, 10/13/12 my ""A"" string broke, and for no apparent reason... not being tuned, or even played at the time.In the course of two months, with only about 5 hours of actual play time on them, they are trash.I figured they wouldn't sound as good as most other strings I've used, but then they only cost $21.Sure enough, they didn't sound as good as a $50 set of strings, but they were apparently already living on borrowed time when I took them out of the envelopes.So much for D'Addario's fancy string envelopes."
5,best spark plugs,These things are sharp. The best price e out there. Best plugs for your dollar. No doubt. I recommend these plugs to anybody. They make a difference
2,Fowled,"These plugs fowled on me at less than 3000 miles. No idea why. Engine quickly began running so rough that I thought I'd thrown the timing belt. Cleaning did not help. I replaced them with NGKs G-Powers. These are now at 5000 miles and no problems. E3's might work great for some applications, but not a 194 straight six."
1,E3 spark plugs,"Bought a set of E3's for my 1993 Audi S4. I used the Amazon parts finder and the ""does this part fit my car"" feature to make sure I was buying the right plugs. Installed the plugs and noticed the idle was smoother. Under light throttle it was fine, BUT under boost(the S4 is turbo charged) I experienced severe misfiring. I replaced the E3's with a set of Bosch F5DP0R plugs(original equipment part)and now my S4 runs perfectly.I had also bought a set of E3's for my 2006 Dodge Dakota H.O. V8. After the experience with the E3 plugs i bought for my Audi I immediately returned the E3 plugs I had bought for my truck."
4,Great for basics,If you are new to win2k server this is the place to start. Simplistic but well documented.
4,Almost good enough as advertised,I updated the latest maps since I got my unit few days ago. All features seem to be working well. But it couldn't locate a nearby restaurant (La Madeleine in Houston)that has been in existence for quite awhile. It located one branch 7.6 miles away which was not the branch we were going to. Other establishments near the restaurant were located successfully though when I tested it. Hmmm... Inserted an SD card with mp3 songs. Excellent sound.
5,Garmin Nuvi,"If you don't already own a GPS, GET ONE. I have had several (I was a dealer 3 years ago), and once you get used to the great things they can do for you when you are in new territory. Find food, where's that motel?, where's a hospital? It's all there.This Nuvi is another solid example of Garmin's great produts. The 650 is loaded with features, and so easy to do basic navigation, it takes about 3 minutes to get going the first time."
4,would buy again,"this gps has a very nice and large screen, however it did not have the most recent changed and added food locations."
5,Great GPS System,I bought this as a gift for my husband not really thinking it would be a big deal but he has used it almost everyday since I gave it to him. It has helped him find banks/restaurants and his way around detours/road blocks; it also lets you download pictures and songs onto the system. I highly recommend this product.
3,Pretty Good,"It works well for the most part, but it lacks precision on anything slightly off of the road, esp. houses. Works great on public roads, for business searches and other pda like functions."
4,Great Price Great Product,"+ Wide Screen+ Decent Display+ mp3s, Photos (Of course, you don't need this in a GPS (imho) )+ Variety of voice selection- Sometimes it does not show the best possible route (especially to a countryside - It let me to drive 35 miles where as I should have gone there in 15 miles - Bad experience )- Few new address are not in the Map (I guess I should update it over the internet)- I'd love if this is in black :)- No Lane assist (OK, for this price you shouldn't expect that)<<Great product for a good price>>"
1,beware,This product has many problems. I called Garmin and they said they can not fix ANY 650's or replace. For the price I would stay clear of this one and also any Garmin you are going to buy call and see if they discontinued all support and exchange for this item Very upset with Garmin at this time!
5,Liked it so much I bought two more,I bought the Nuvi 660 two years ago. It is so useful that I bought two of the Nuvi 650's as 2007 Christmas presents. I never used the Bluetooth and didn't feel the traffic alert was that accurate. I updated the maps on my old one a few months ago with the DVD which is also available at [...] (Garmin Map Update 2008 City Navigator for North America NT (010-10989-00 and 010-10989-50)).
4,Garmin 650 nuvi,I think they need to send an owners manuel with the unit and it should be better written explaining how to enter a place useing an address.I think it is a very good unit.
5,Beautiful device!,"All I can say is that this device is very well executed as far as user interface friendliness and the features it has. I bought this for my parents (they are not tech savvy). They love it. It gets the job done very well and works 100% of the time, so far. I am even thinking to get one for my wife now. I don't need one though, the navigation system is built-in in my head :-). On the other thought, if someone would give it to me as a gift, I would really love to play with it."
2,Won't last for more than 2 1/2 years,"The unit functioned okay for 2 1/2 years of low use until the touch screen stopped working. There is a forum on Amazon where dozens of users have had the same problem and Garmin won't fix the units even though there appears to be a serious defect. Another problem was that the longer I had the unit, the longer it would take to acquire satellites. I'm now shopping for a new unit and won't give Garmin my business again."
1,Worst GPS ever,The GPS works until it is updated. The software update forces you to buy a map update (by disabling the touch screen and giving you a map update notice). The current map updates are much larger than the drive. Garmin says the model is no longer supported. I recommend buying a supported model or not updating your software.
1,Garmin Nuvi 650,"It was great at the beginning, but the touch screen freezes up after a couple of year. Now it is not functional and become a junk............."
4,Needs a new voice,"Product works well, particularly with the moveable base. It is accurate and gives timely instructions. My prior GPS was a Magellan and I find trying to locate someplace by category is harder here. I also do not like the american female voice, she sounds like a nagging teacher ('recalculating'). I use the Aussie voice, but sometimes it is hard to make out the street with her accent. Other then the voice, it's a good product."
5,Love my Garmin,I really enjoy this product and like the fact that I can take it with me in any car and even use it when i'm walking somewhere (has walking feature). I also like the fact that you can stick new maps in it if you're traveling out of the country. A friend of mine took hers to Italy and it was very helpful for her when they she trying to get around.
4,garmin,great product - have a little trouble with the touch screen: touch works but slightly off the spot to be touched
3,Lack of manual,I returned the highly recommended Garmin GPS because there was no manual to explain the unit for me.
1,Storage is not as advertized - Garmin won't answer me,"Yeah, it's simple and easy to use. But where is the 700MB of free internal space advertised? Mine had a measly 220MB free when it was new, right out of the box. My Garmin's total capacity is 1.38GB, and not the 2GB in the literature. Why? I don't know. Garmin doesn't respond to emails and the page for registered owners to receive technical support is not working. Thanks, Garmin. If I have to spend more than 30 minutes on hold trying to get an answer, or your phone support is also not working, Amazon can expect a return and TomTom can expect some new business.Oh, and Garmin overcharged me $40 for an add-on map compared to their own advertised price... no answer to my question on that little slip up either."
4,excellent product,great product the large screen helps when typing in address and viewing commands on the screen
4,Good but....,"The NUVI is a good PND, however, its not perfect; love the larger screen but the maps do not show the street I live on. Further, should you not take the advised directions (say you go in driveway B, but the devise wanted you to take driveway A, it has a conniption fit and you might as well restart the device, it just can't handle that you arrived at the correct place in the (debatably) wrong way. Those points aside, the devise processes information quickly with little lag, you won't miss your next turn unless you decide to (which the device will quickly recalculate). For the price, I am disappointed that it did not include CD (maps), carrying case etc... Downloading map updates is a real drag even with high-speed internet, the companies servers appear to default to 56K it took all night to download and update my NUVI!!!!! I really like what the DASH Express is all about but I'm afraid it's not ready for prime time yet, so in the meantime, NUVI is about as good as it gets - 4 stars."
3,Garmin Nuvi 650,"Although I like the Garmin (when it works), I feel that the software is not up-to-date. With this being a recent purchase I should not have to purchase an update at this time. I would have liked to know the date of the software in this model before my purchase but was unable to find it and just took a chance and purchased it. I returned the first Garmin for out dated software but this one seems to be the same. Overally, good product for the price, and better than other brands in the same price range."
3,Good GPS Unit,"Might want to consider the Nuvi 200W instead to save $$$. But this model works very well out of the box, and is easy to use. Maps could be a bit more updated. A bit large for carrying comfortably in pocket. Navigation works very well. Overall a good design, and a reliable product. Display is excellent. Display and other options pretty good. Would like to see an external mute button on these units."
3,Garmin 650 Nav,"Product is easy to program and simple to use. Screen is easy to read and automatic light level is nice. The unit has more features than needed.Dislikes: Routes are often very circutious even if using ""shortest"" route. Tried both ""fastest"" route and ""shortest"" route and not any significant difference. This unit is for my college age daughter. I have a factory unit the came with my Honda Pilot and this unit has much better directions, althought not as easy to program.POI is almost useless on the Garmin.Would like to see a unit that you can teach a prefered route, like entering short cuts and back roads."
3,POI db is way out of date and where is the routing planner,"I just bought this Nuvi 650 based on all the positive reviews from the GPS sites. Decided to plan a long trip with it and guess what? You can only put 1 way point in the route? 500 way points is a little misleading. 500 favorites are more like it. Plus, a lot of the POI that have been around for 5 years in my area isn't in the database. I really must feel I need to return this unit because of the lack of ability to create a route with multiple way points and what seems like an outdated POI database. I'm still trying to decide if I can cope with using the GPS as a device with a bunch of short hops for a long trip. That sort of nullifies the estimated arrival time to final destination."
2,Map is not updated,"I just received the Garmin 650 from Amazon yesterday and I'm very disappointed with it after reading all the good reviews in here. I think the map is not updated! I've used the Garmin 350 before and it was better. I like this one because of the 4.3 inch screen. I've been using it a few times already and it always give me incorrect directions! Maybe Amazon sent me an outdated one since I got it for a very good deal? I don't know, but I'm really disappointed with this one. I like the Garmin 350 much better. The color and everything else was good though. Only the directions sucks."
4,love my nuvi,"Great product. The touch and drag option is weaker compared to other nuvi models i've seen. Otherwise, it's really cool."
4,GPS = great for any driver!,"I really enjoy my new Garmin GPS! It is very accurate and takes all the stress away from potentially getting lost.Positives: Large Screen (MUCH easier to use than a smaller screen); Spoken Street Names; Accurate distance tracking; Quick ""Recalculating""; many applications.Negatives: Wish it had better volume control; Wish it told you where you were going sooner or on the screen.All in all=a great buy!"
3,My Garmin 650,"I was very happy with the service, with the shipping, and with the time elements involved; however, when I opened the box, there was no manual, and after attempting to download it from the Web, it didn't work, I had to call the company. However, they were very helpful, and mailed me a manual. This caused a little concern because of the need to test the item before the thirty days were up.The big thing is that when I went on the Web, to download the manual, the words ""discontinued"" came up; this certainly told me that I had gotten a good price for a good reason. I think this is unfair. It should have been advertised as such. Again, the Garmin rep assured me that myGPS was, indeed, workable, and adequate. Time will tell if it is.All in all, I am pleased, so far, with the unit; not so happy with Amazon.com."
3,Not Great,"This is one of the few items we actually returned to Amazon over the last 10 years. The 650 appeared on one of the ""Deals of the Day"" for a very-good price. We had been researching GPS for a while and we knew this Garmen rated in the top. However, one comment that a previous reader said about not enough bang for the buck stuck in my mind and I researched more AFTER the order.The previous reader was correct: This stripped down 650 did not compare well in value, even against the 660, if you consider the extras of the 660. After further research on our part and we ended up with the Magellian 4250. 'Maggie' we call her is loaded with extras like blue tooth, voice recognition, hardware included, etc., and we are well pleased with her.Magellan Maestro 4250 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator"
2,Non Replaceable Battery,The GPS has worked extremely well for me since purchasing it in June 2008. Recently the battery will not hold a recharge. I followed Garmin advice and completely discharged the device and recharged it. The new charge lasted for about 5 minutes. I was then advised to send the GPS in for a battery replacement for $99. I would have expected a battery to last longer that 21 months.
2,Lifespan - 1 year,"7-8 months after purchasing this item from Amazon I started noticing the touch-screen was not responsive after a few hours of usage. After a bit over a year the screen stopped working all together. I have tried every Garmin forum under the sun for a fix, no luck. So here I am stuck with a product 13-14 months old that does not work and no warranty. I would not recommend this product."
4,Excellent GPS,I recently purchased the Nuvi 650 and have been extremely pleased with it. It is very intuitive to use and the screen is bright and clear. Directions have been amazingly accurate. The spoken street names are a great feature on this model.
5,Love this GPS,"I'm glad we picked this one. Easy to read and navigate onscreen. Offers lots of choices for viewing, and a good travel companion!"
4,garmin 650,This was an excellent price for the product!!! It is great for anyone who is not interested in all the bells in whistles...it is the large screen and has the street names with the voice commands plus written directions. The suction for the window keeps falling off...
1,touch screen failed after two years,"Bought in 2007, have been quite well except that sometimes it told me where to turn kinda last minute... but this is not too much a problem.Wouldn't complain at all... until recently touch screen just stopped working all of a sudden. Tried reset, reboot. Wouldn't work. Called Customer Service, said it cost $99 for me to send it in and get a refurb one. Worst thing is, the agent i spoke with sounded relentless and harsh. He went like ""you should just go get a new one that has more of an updated map"". And i know! Except that I thought i could call for a better solution.No garmin for me. Ever. Touch screen sucks!!!!!!"
4,Works well,"I live in the suburbs outside of Washington DC. THis is the only navigation systems I have owned and used so I cannot compare it to others.The Garmin has worked very well. I don't know if it always takes the fastest route, but they have all gotten us there without hassle. I say this because I have used it on trips where I know where I am going just to try it out and found that the Garmin took me a way I normally don't go. This may be because it truly is better or because I have local knowledge that makes me go a different way. One example is a trip around the ""Beltway"" or 495. The Garmin wanted to take us through the city - I opted to go around the city. I'm sure without traffic the Garmin route would be quicker... but not with DC traffic.I love the ""text to speach"" option - the garmin actually says the names."
3,garmin nuvi 650,"this gps is great, easy to use I would give it a 5 but I don't like the map program it uses."
1,"Charger died, Garmin support took time to get through, but helped.","It worked very well for the first 2.5 months. I rely on it to get me places and after 2.5 months, it shut off and would not stay on. The battery was run down and it would not recharge with the 12V cigarette lighter attachment.It took some time on the customer service line, about 15 minutes. However, they were helpful and are sending out the cable and adapter for the 12V line. Better than having to ship the thing in and wait."
4,Garmin 650 GPS,We bought the Garmin 650 because it is motorhome friendly.I don't like u-turns with a 37' motorhome. We u-dated from a Street Piolt 5. This also was for motorhomes. I love the text to speech for directions.
5,enamoured with Nuvi,This device is everything I imagined. Very intuitive and easy to use. GPS functionality seems excellent.
3,wmartin,"I like the Garmin 650 with one proviso, It doesn't always indicate the shortest way to my destination. It seems to favor the hiway rather than the byway."
4,Discontinued,"I went to Garmin's website to download the instruction book. The Garmin website said this model is discontinued. I think Amazon should have posted this information before making a purchase. Although I like the unit, I would not have purchased a discontinued item."
4,Garmin Nuvi 650,We are very pleased with the unit. Very simple to use. Lots of extras we didn't realize this unit had. Great value for the money.
5,My husband loves this GPS,"My husband is very happy with this Garmin 650. I bought it for him for Christmas, but decided to give it to him early since we were making a trip for the holidays. It was very easy to set up and the large screen is very helpful. His old GPS was about five years old and a lot of new features have been added. I was a little worried about buying this model since I understood that it had been discontinued by Garmin, but the price was so good for the features it contained, I couldn't resist taking a chance. It was a good decision. He really wanted one with the larger screen."
4,Very nice product for the price,"I bought the Garmin Nuvi 650 for my wife. One of the things that I liked about Garmin is that the unit did not come with the latest maps, but there was a free upgrade for the 2009 maps once I registered my GPS. It also came with suction cup attachment for the car. I thought I was going to have to purchase that seperately."
3,Navigator,"We used the Nuvi in unfamiliar New Jersey and returning to our home state in Colorado. I like the display and functionality when driving, however it did not have the latest names for streets and in several cases did not even have the street we were on (not that new, either). I still haven't found how to revise settings (e.g. what constitutes home). In South Dakota it sent us to a Kentucky Fried Chicken that had been closed for years! I also do not like the irritation in the navigator's voice (recalculating!) when we turn off the main route for gasoline or something to eat or to see a sight. I have updated the software from the computer, but still it is behind on new developments. Other than that, we found it invaluable for our trip."
2,"Nice GPS, AWFUL customer service","I have had my Nuvi650 for 3 years. Overall, i liked it. Naturally, the maps get old. I purchased an update for 69.99 on August 1st. One month later and about 15 hours of work, I still can't download the maps. Average wait time for customer service is about 30 minutes. The reps are nice, but they don't know what they are talking about. I have followed their instructions to the letter, but it still doesn't work. I am giving up, and will demand a refund, which means another 30 minutes on hold. Its cheaper/easier just to buy another GPS [not Garmin] every couple of years. Too bad Garmin doesn't care about its customers. Oh, by the way, after a year you'll have to buy a new adapter as it will fall apart, piece of junk."
5,garmin 650,excellent product--better than ever expected --only concern is that i hear it is discontinued now
5,Garmin Nuvi 650,"Excellent GPS unit. I bought 3 for each of my kids for Christmas and they have already been put to use. My daughter in the Air Force used hers driving from Ft. Meade MD to Beale AFB, CA. My son in the Navy drove from Dayton, OH to Everett, WA and my other son uses his extensively within the state of Ohio. All three of the kids swear by this GPS as one of the best they've seen, ease of operation and super accuracy. You can't get lost even if you tried. The Garmin 650 is a great, great GPS unit and very affordable. Recommend it to all whether you drive locally or cross country like my kids."
3,First time user.,"My job has me on the road to many different places for extended periods. After the first time a GPS was a must. After a year and a half I can't imagine leaving home without it. The freedom of always knowing where you are and how to get to your destination takes a lot of stress away, allowing you to enjoy trips and explore without concern. With that said there are a few flaws and glitches that need to be considered.For long trips, reviewing a map to verify the garmin's route is a must. The only options are the shortest route or fastest route. Often this leaves out interstates and other highways since the software does not take into account traffic lights, stop signs or city centers. It assumes you will maintain the posted speed at all times.The business search function is very handy, but requires the yearly updates to be purchased to remain useful. The only free updates are additional graphics and software patches."
4,Garmin Nuvi 650 GPS,"This is an excellent product, easy to use and accurate too boot. The screen is clear and readable in all but the most direct sunlight. The voice volume could be a little louder, but my truck is 20+ years old and not the quietest ride around."
4,Great except for minor issues with some locations,Garmin Nuvi 650 Personal Travel Assistant for North America works great for the most part. I have encountered some issues with the map in some areas. I hope these issues with the maps will be fixed in the near future.
1,Garmin nuvi 650 Failure,"I have owned a 650 for 2 years. A few months ago, the unit became erratic and/ or inoperable. I have done the 4 fixes that Garmin tech support sent to mewith no success. Each fix works well for one day, then the unit becomes erratic or unusable again. They have suggested a repair or replacement with the same model.Since many owners have reported the same poor quality symptoms, I am reluctant to get another 650 unit ... e.g., may be getting a bad for another bad.I believe, and have suggested to Garmin tech support, that they should have issued a quality recall because of owners problems within 2 years of operation. Somethingthat costs (at that time) about $240 should not operate this poorly. I have yet to see a response (they have been very quick and courteous) about a recall."
2,It has a mind of its own,Great product for areas you have no idea how to get to but to use locally it will never find a shortcut. I actually have to trick it to find my way home sometimes so it will recalculate the right direction. Maps are not updated completely. In fact went to a local Wegmans which has been there for at least 5 years. Thank goodness i knew where it was because the Garmin said it was swamp land. lol
4,garmin 650 gps,"Pro:Easy to set up and operate.Comprehensive list of places of interest, shopping, dining, gas, etc...Bright easy to read display.Portable.Excellent priceCon:Windshield attachment comes off [I bought a bean bag for the dash and it works fine}.Voice sometimes misspronounces local streets.No instruction manual {download from Garmin website}.Overall I am very satisfied with the garmin 650"
4,Nuvi 650/ good option,"This is the first GPS system I buy and it's working pretty well. Instructions are clear, the screen is user friendly, the 4.3 "" works for me perfectly well. I really like it."
5,GARMIN NUVI 650,"A really fine unit. Allows you to navigate from point to point with all the information you need, turns, distances, times and speeds. Voice prompts are well in advance of direction changes. I have found that the actual GPS is usually accurate to within 30 feet. The screen is easily seen on the brightest day. The only negative that I've found is that the screen tends to be to bright at night, so you may choose to adjust the intensity. The unit is a snap to program and an overall excellent choice."
1,"broke after 40 days, and they would not replace it","I bought this for 180$. It worked fine for the first few days. When I really needed it, it did not work. The screen will not respond to touch and this made it useless. I tried to contact the seller. They will not do anything about it as it is beyond the 30 days warranty!"
4,Garmin 360,"I like the Garmin 360. However, I set the address to travel to a high school in a town called Lucas and it took me to an old dilapidated barn on a farm. Luckily the street was correct so I headed in the other direction and came upon the school after driving about a mile. So, I'm a little gun-shy now but will continue to use it as it has taken me to other locations OK."
3,some strange directions,"We purchased this Garmin nuvi 650 to replace a nuvi 200 that someone took from our car. The price was good, and we had liked our 200, and the 650 seemed to have added features. However, it gives some VERY strange directions--I'd think it just needed updating, but it has some newer restaurants, etc. on it, so I'm not sure what the problem is. It gives wrong road numbers and turns and doesn't even know where our house is. If we can get it updated, hopefully it will be fine. The picture and voice are good."
4,Performs as expected,"Bought the Nuvi 650 for all of the features it included at a price just under $200.00 including super saver free shipping. Had read other reviews and comparisons to the 260W and the only complaint I had seen was that the volume on the 650 needs to be almost all the way up to hear the turn directions. That is pretty much true, but the volume is loud enough to hear as long as you don't have the radio turned way up or the windows open. The wide screen display is very bright with good resolution. Easier to view than the standard screen size. The satellite reception is fantastic. I believe the flip up antenna is better than the built in antennas on other units. It has fairly quick satellite acquisition time and I get satellite reception before I even leave the garage. Overall for the approx. $200.00 price, I am very satisfied with the Nuvi 650."
4,"Garmin - good, but . . .","I like the big screen. I like the graphics. It works well. I would have liked a little more information in the box. I also have a part that I don't know anything about - where it goes, what it is for, etc. Overall it is good, just can't give it five stars."
1,Stay Away!!,"While the product probably worked great when new, the retailer warehousedeals that sells ""refurbished products"" never took the time to ensure it's proper functioning. The battery would not hold more then a 2 minute charge."
3,So so,"After having used it for over 3 years, here are the major flaws of this model as I see it:1. The start up process is slow. It takes about 2 minutes for the GPS to ""warm up"" and start to calculate and show directions;2. The battery is almost dead: even after fully charged, it can only last for no more than 5 minutes when the charging cable is disconnected;3. The suction cup mount doesn't really work. You'd have to buy other types of mounting device."
1,Touchscreen Failure,"My Nuvi 650 is 1 year and 9 months old and the touch screen does not respond. I contacted Garmin through email and was told to try a couple of things and in the email they stated ""If your touchscreen is still unresponsive, we are no longer repairing that device"". I paid almost $400 for this unit and it didn't even last two years and I don't use it that often. One of my friends bought a TomTom at the same time and paid less than $200 for it and it is still working. I will not purchase another Garmin product."
5,Absolutely the best for $$$,"I strongly recommend this product for people with the same requirements as me: just a navigation unit. I specifically did not care for the hands-free option or radio transmitter option - just a good navigation unit. Hands-free is great, but I don't want to have this in the car all the time. Radio transmitter is a great idea - but as in other ones I tried before, this one (so I've read) is no better. The quality just does not cut it for me. Bottom line: wide-screen, reliable, easy-to-use, awesome price, free 2009 maps, etc. What more could you want?Note: I did extensive reading on other units before buying this one. Some are pretier and may have a few extra bells, but when it came to overall quality (not even price), this seemed to be the best choice."
1,it's not up to date yet!!! land o lake city of florida not show!!!!!!,"this product very nice looking,but not up to date yet,example:city of florida{land o lake}not show on the map or sattelite!!!!!well get bettertechnology,i bought tomm tomm produce not satifastion then i bought garminproduce still screw me up!!!!!!!!!"
1,Greatly disappointed,"Being a single traveler, I was more than excited to recieve this product before the vacation season. It arrived in my hometown only to be returned by the shipping server as ""undeliverable due to a bad address."" I have lived at this address since 1975 and never before had this happen. A phone call would have resolved this situation. I will purchase one thru a local retailer now."
4,Excellent Product,I am using this Product from past one month and its really pretty good product. Though I am new to US with this porduct I am able to find what ever I want. I am planning to visit more placesses in these holidays. I am very pleased with this product.
2,Great but,"This one is good. However, others do better in the following area...1) intuitiveness of User Interface, key information about trip, insertion of Via-Points and review of directions and review of trip map.2) Upgrades to the Mapset bought with GPS.It is little bit expensive when you compare with similar models of others."
3,Nuvi 650 lacks some important features.,It does not pick your preffered rout and insists on its pre programmed routs. It does not have what is known as bread crumbs. And for the most part you cannot just type the name of a business or an institution to find the directions. You have to know full address of your destination. eg I could not get directions to a well known hospital in the city by merely putting its name in. Ditto for a University in my city.I hear Tom Tom takes care of these problems. At times it tries to take you through a circuitous rout for apperent reason.
2,two defects,"It has two defects:It does not show the speed limit on different roads, and it does show graphically which way to turn on next (left arrow or right arrow). Both were very important to me so I had to buy another GPS (TomTom) to cover these needs and even it was cheaper."
5,Great Garmin,This is a fantastic product. It is intuitive and easy to use. Much easier than trying to read a map while driving.
3,ok Buy,"Overall this product have good features but it won't recognize the oneway streets in the cities, and also where no left turn is allowed , You can't just follow the navigation directions. have to look at street signs. I hope Garmin will improve this section. I dont know if other GPS systems gives this important feature as we need on the road."
3,Good unit in 2008 but not in 2012,"10-2012. I bought the Garmin nüvi 650 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator on 2008, as my first GPSunit. It was satisfactory and met minimum needs. As time passed the size of the US maps grew and the unit would no longer hold them. I replaced it with a nuvi 2595LMT in 9-2012, because only 1/4 of the US maps would fit the limited memory size. The 650 has outlived it's usefullness. It is now just a backup."
4,A Traveler's Companion,"This is a brief diary of the author's trip to the Holy Land. I read it in preparation of my own journey and did not find it particularly helpful as I could not visualize his experience. It was, however, a fine devotional guide on the journey itself. The author brings the reader into a variety of meditations and prayers around shrines in Israel. I found myself resonnating with the author's insights and making my own notes in reflection as some of the chapters are quite moving. The introduction of the book recounts the author's aburpt death. That is a loss for us all. I only hope that he is still writing as he awaits his readers."
5,for son's care,we used these to build a sport suspension. Wow! I am going to have to upgrade my daily driver with these!
1,Bad deal,"I submitted a fairly large order to Amazon recently. One Amazon item and three that were stores selling through Amazon. I will never make this mistake again. The orders took a long time to process and ship along with three separate (high percentage) shipping costs. Even Amazon's part of this order was delayed by this confusing, shocking, mess.I haven't used this product yet. It appears to be fine. However, it is certainly not worth the money with the additional shipping costs."
3,about as much as is possible,"This book contains about as much info as is available,I suppose.It's about 10 years old,so their latest work is not covered,obviously.I think the author did as good a job as he could given the fact that he had very little to work with.If you can find a copy that is not over-priced,it's worth a look.The book is rather hard to come by and my copy was sort of expensive,relative to it's content.If you're a Rez addict,then I guess it's worth it."
4,"Good, BUT...","I installed the rack easily on my Toyota Landcruiser spare tire that is at the right side, with the angle of the rack the bike stays centered. Until then, everything was fine. BUT, I had to buy a Frame Adaptor for my dual suspension MB (40$ more for each bike), it was the only way to mount them on the rack, there is no other way."
5,Wonderful Movie!!,Who ever did the cosutmes in this movie was excellent! I love Alan Ladd in this role. Mayo was perfect too. You will like it I promise you that!!
4,Escape Into History,"[[ASIN:B001XUSZHQ The Iron Mistress - Movie Poster - 11 x 17]Of course the Alamo is missing from The Iron Mistress. To include it would nullify the theme of the movie.Who/what is the iron mistress should not be hard to determine. A prerequisite to determining the answer is to know what Jim Bowie was running from in the Iron Mistress movie and knowing what eventually happened to him.Have the answer yet? The reviewers that I have read to date obviously missed the obvious.I am tempted to give you the answer. Hint: It is not the knife. Even though one reviewer describes the knife as Bowie's ""iron mistress,"" how can that be the answer, when by the end of the movie Bowie has rejected the knife and what it represents? Think beyond Bowie's control."
4,The real Jim Bowie?,"Action-packed, lavish fun. Heavily fictionalized story of Jim Bowie's early years. Virginia Mayo is great as a femme fatale. Transfer is excellent."
4,No Nonsense Tips & Tricks for New Managers or Leaders,"Do you like 300 pages book having 8 to 10 great management ideas with hundreds of examples? No, then this book is for you. This book is very condense and includes only meaningful ideas for managers or leaders. I liked this book because of its simplicity. This book is very very simple and you can finish it in one sitting of one to two hours. Just imagine getting 9-10 ideas in just two hours. I can tell you its like a summary of tips and tricks of the leadership by one of the best CEO on the planet. Best part of this book is that instead of just theory it also gives you suggestions on how to use those ideas in real life. If you like reading summaries of self help books go ahead and read this one. You will not regret it."
2,more wasted floor space,"I thought this would be full of flavor and my dog would go nuts over it. He uses it as a toy instead of a treat, he loves to hide his toys for later And him being a ridgeback who goes nuts when you move his hidden stuff he will look for it all over until he finds it so basically im stuck with this stinky thing."
3,Eh - you can do better for the money,"I bought a few of these to try them out and was not too impressed. They don't have much meat on them and my dogs doesn't go crazy for them.For this price you're much better off buying cow gullet or lamb trotter bones, which have a lot more meat and dogs love."
1,Awful!!!,The re-recorded video was awful! I do not let my children watch it due to the prejudice references. The cartoons are very old. Mel Blanc does not do the voices. Don't waste your money! I only gave this one star because it won't let you rate it without a star.
4,To Be Continued?,Author weaves technical aspects of living in Wildfire country into an enjoyable and quick read. More in-depth development of characters begs for a continuation of the story ......
1,Not as advertised,The product pictured was not the product received. The product recieved is a cheap china auger with less than half the number of turns; and sheared off in clay soil on first use. DO NOT buy.
1,Where's the info?,"I agree with. C. McGuinness ""msintenz"" It's hard to buy products like this online when we have no information to go from. It does look very nice though."
5,Honest and Intriguing,This book gives insight to the real teenager and thoughts they may not normally share in a verbal manner. It is honest and expressive in a way that kids can relate to. What a wonderful reading for both adults and kids.
2,little of value,"I bought this book hoping it might contain suggestions that would help my 13-year-old control his temper. The good thing about this book is that it makes it clear to your kid that s/he is not the only angry teenager in the world. It provides first-hand accounts of the feelings of other angry kids. What is disappointing about this book is that it has few concrete suggestions to help kids prevent or recover from the loss of self-control that comes with a fit of anger. (""Count to 10"" is one of the better ones -- but who needs to buy a book to learn that?)I found ""Yes, Your Teen Is Crazy"" to be a much more helpful book; while its primary target is parents, my son found it helpful too."
4,ITS GOOD,"This books is enough to understand the forecast in policy analysis. Anyway, I was hoping a more systematic overview."
3,Not as good as Baldur's Gate,"I got this game thinking it was another, newer, better version of Bauldur's Gate, it ain't. It just doesn't have the interactivity that Baldur's Gate, not as many side quests, and just not as much fun. I like it, but prefer the Baldur's Gate style combat then the Diablo style. Plus I like being able to control the ENTIRE party, not just one character. I guess its made more for online play, but I'm just not into that. I still wish BioWare would come out with another better version of the original Baldur's Gate, I really think there would be a HUGE market for it."
4,"Versatile, replayable","The best thing about this game is the replayability factor, thanks to player-made modules. I recommend getting the Platinum edition, as many of the modules available for download require one or both of the expansion packs."
4,WOW,this game is like crack. its hard to pull away from this game. i hope you dont have a life cause this will pull you away from it.
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"Judging from the title and the description, I was expecting a book that looked at physics and theology. I thought there would be science in there somewhere, and deep discussions of Life, The Universe, and Everything.Nope. This is a pleasant enough Lenten study, but there isn't any physics in it.That is not an intrinsic flaw in the book; I just felt that you should be warned."
5,A Fantastic Lenten Journey!!,"This is the BEST Lenten book I have ever used! I love it so much that I started a Lenten Series with 26 people! We meet every Monday night during Lent and people feel badly when they have to miss a gathering. WE ARE ALL CONNECTED AND LOVE COMING TOGETHER TO SHARE AND REFLECT ON GOD'S AWESOME GOODNESS AND LOVE! THANKS JUDY! You'll soon get a photo of all of us! Thank you and God Bless you for your generosity in sharing your gifts and talents! I'm looking forward to your next book.Sister Rose Therese Di Gregorio, OSF"
1,Who knows?,"I haven't received this book yet. I'm sure it will be here before Lent, right?Then I can evaluate its worth."
1,Horrible for a modern work,"With misinterpretations of current theory (particularly on consonance and dissonance), an arrogant focus on mostly the Stanford and MIT group of the past, this book should be avoided.There are many problems with symbols used in the text, many of which are non-standard (he uses P for intensity when it is used as Pressure in most books).The book has mostly lame, tacked-on material on digital sound (played up incorrectly as a feature on the back cover). Music V is from the late 1960s!The revisions are minor to the first addition.This is not a modern work, not a good exposition, not worthy of American university classes.There is absolutely no cross-cultural material on tunings, or discussion of musical instrument acoustics.The ordering of material is startlingly disjunct, the focus unclear, except that the author liked these subjects, while rejecting myriad issues."
2,ERROR - Harry Partch,"Many people who are looking at this book probably already know about the life and works of microtonal composer and instrument inventor Harry Partch. (If you don't, you'd find great enjoyment in seeking this out!) I play on these instruments at the Harry Partch Instrumentarium at Montclair State University in NJ. How upsetting it was to immediately and excitedly turn to this book's section on Harry Partch's musical system to find the entire system misrepresented. The author says that his just intoned system starts on ""C"", when it really starts on ""G"". Therefore, all of the examples displayed are wrong and need to be transposed a fourth down. How infuriating!"
5,Best in price range.,"As a musician and general audiophile, I have a large collection, and an obsession with headphones of all shapes and sizes. These JVC's are obviously not going to sound like $300.00 studio monitors, but they do their job very well. The dynamics are great, with a smooth curve, and ample attention to midrange. They're less bassy than their SONY counterparts, which is actually advantageous, as the SONYs were way too bassy. You'll have to make sure that you use the right size silicone ear-piece (3 sizes included) The volume slider on the cord is great, however the cord is wicked long!These are a perfect replacement for the crap headphones that came with your iPod. Buy them if you are looking for earbuds under $30.00."
2,Nice fit not so good sound,They work for the price guess I was hoping for more. They do not get very loud and do not block out the sound very well. In a noisy environment I cannot even hear what I am listening to at max volume on my zune.
2,Awful,"The fidelity is not very good. I din't expect all that much, but the real problem is that the cord is too long to work well with an Ipod. The cord tangles like crazy and the offset lengths to accomodate the volume control make the headset clumsy. I just quit using the headphones in favor of the stock ipod ones."
2,never using these again!,"Bought these around 4 years ago. The pastel colors are nice and for a ten pack I thought I was getting a great deal. The first time I used one, it was okay, but it was easy for the razor to slip sideways and therefore cut the skin. That, I could stand, I figured I would just have to be more careful. HOWEVER, the next time I used it, the razor cut me, and it didn't even slip sideways! It literally shaved a piece of my skin off, and sorry for being graphic now, but upon examination there was a little bit of flesh included on that strip of skin. That was how I learned that you really do get what you paid for, especially when it comes to razors. I really do hope that they have since redesigned these razors, but I for one, am never using these again."
2,Will do in a pinch...,"I only purchased these because the price was so good. In the end, I sort of regret it. They only have two blades, so it takes longer to shave. Also, they don't bend at the neck at all, so its easy to cut yourself on tricky areas like your ankles and knees. I might bring them with me to travel however,because each razor only lasts MAYBE two uses and the razors are definitely disposable. Overall, I would say don't buy unless you really need cheap razors or unless you need something for travel purposes."
4,razor fine,"very light weight. shaves fine so far. no problems, good price. pretty colors. its a razor, what can i say"
3,Its OK,Not the sharpest tool. Sometime I have to press kind of too hard and that can lead to cuts. Cheap. Truly disposable. I do not think you can use that razor more than twice.
5,great deep movie,"really great deep movie with great acting performances.. very unique, not a hollywood trend style"
3,I'd give it 3.5,It was part Sin City (mostly wrt Brendan Fraser protecting the singer) and part Closer (all of the plot lines converged).
4,"Hmm. Captivating, a little slow, but I was pulled in!","This movie is a little slow at first, but the characters are good, and most feel real. I found myself pulled in. I was watching this movie, kinda went 'hmm. interesting. not sure if im liking this or not...i think i do.' and by the end it was 'actually, i really like this movie. A Lot.' I don't buy a lot of movies- usually only ones im gonna watch repeatedly, you know? well i bought this one. It could have done without some of the stripper/nudity scenes, i thought it wasnt needed, but whatever; idk, that kid kinda irritated me. I guess he's supposed to. But I love the SMG/Fraser/Garcia line. Very good I think."
4,Stunning Brainbender,"This movie was nothing of what I expected to come from the all-star cast and crew, but it wound up being a brilliant piece of well-crafted film. The story takes you on separate but related journeys between various characters, and ties them all together in an interesting way. This movie is incredibly emotional and will take you on a roller coaster ride from shocked to angry to laughing to (a whole lot of) sadness. The cast and acting are amazing, and it's not every day you get to see big name actors like this portraying realistically normal people. I would say that foremost, this is a movie about the harsh reality of the real world, it's not a candy-coated Hollywood jewel that will make you feel good. In the end you're not going to be happy or uplifted or well-entertained, but maybe you'll have a more realistic outlook on life and learn a few things. ;)"
4,SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH IT TO STEP OUT SIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE!......SOMETIMES IT'S NOT!,"This is an interesting film in the 'Crash' vein where four parts mesh together to make up the whole. It's nice to see Brendan Fraser in a decent film again and despite some harsh criticism, this film is very good! The center theme of this film is each of the main characters step outside their normal routine and have mixed results. It's a thought provoking film, that raises a lot of questions about life. Is it better to be safe or live on the edge. I found this film to be better after I thought about it for a while. I like that when a film can do that to me!"
2,Fingers is a real piece of work,"Big name cast, but this melodrama is a muddled mess in which none of the characters ring true. Neither do any of the situations. Not a single person is likeable, either. In fact, I have no idea what this is really about. Something heavy like how we are all interconnected? Beats me. Andy Garcia is so over the top cruel that I actually smirked during one of his many scream scenes. Watch if you can't find anything else, but be forewarned."
3,"Interesting Movie, Quirky & Artsy......","But still reminiscent of other movies like Crash, Magnolia, & Traffic. This movie contains an all star cast of well-know actors, whom play vastly different characters. Each main character's life is uniquely intertwined and it isn't until the end of the movie that we see the complete picture of how and where their lives intersect.The movie plays out in four vignettes that make up the entire movie as a whole. Each major character we see portrays one of the following emotions of sorrow, happiness, pleasure & love in this film, which makes for a novel viewing of this movie... Overall acting is good with the exception of Brendan Fraser.... For whatever reason he doesn't seem credible in his role in this film."
4,Very intirguing movie. Nice piece of celluloid.,"The stellar cast by itself would be enough to spice one's curiosity. Come on, Fraser, Garcia, Gellar, Whitaker, Bacon, Delpy, Hirsch... It's unresistible.But, as the saying goes, the road to hell is full of good intentions, and this low-budget project could be a catastrophe. But it is not. The movie is farily good, captivating. All the actors involved give solid performances, no matter how much screen time they got.Good movie."
3,great actors,"i watched this film mainly for the actors sarah michelle gellar,kevin bacon,brendan fraser, have to say it was a very weird story line 4 different story going at the same time and then they all link together,i think i would of liked to have seen more"
4,A romanic-tragic story,"I liked this movie. It was romantic, sad, violent, but yet it had a good ending that is hard to find these days."
1,A blender movie,"This is a blender movie: filled with familiar characters, stereotypes, scenes from many previous ""thrillers."" It is very slow moving and filled with gratuitous violence. Nothing surprising in the end as several plots ""come together."" Skip it."
1,The Air I Breathe left me gasping for breath,"A stellar cast, including Kevin Bacon, Forest Whitaker, Brendan Fraser, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Andy Garcia, come together under the aegis of a director who uses all the cheap camera tricks from his career in music videos to squeeze out of his ensemble cast 90 minutes of sheer nothingness."
1,Brilliant acting in a total waste,"The film is a poor ripoff of the Oscar-winning film ""Crash"". Intersecting lives at a non-stop pace in contrived situations. Forest Whitaker, Sarah Michelle Geller, and Brenda Frasier overact excellently in a poor script that never touches us or is believable in any way, even in an allegorical sense. Andy Garcia fumes in an absurd Al Pacino imitation and Emile Hirsch tries his hand unsuccessfully at clowning. Kevin Bacon is not bad at displaying his late-life-in new-found self image of being a loving good guy. At least Julie Delpy with nothing to do didn't look absurd. All in all the picture is a noisy mess, a pretentious, boring, irrelevant depiction about chance encounters in life that the Director seems to think he knows something about. So much talent wasted in a piece of trash - rhymes with bash, dash, cash, rehash, CRASH!!! Avoid it."
4,What a great movie,"This movie was on my Netflix list and when I got it I didn't even know what the movie was about (I just put it on my list because I love Brendan Frasier). As soon as I watched the movie I bought it.What a great movie! Suspense, sadness, drama, amazing acting. I cried. Absolutely recommended."
3,A Compilation Full of Good Advice,"I generally don't care for compilations, especially about the writing business. I was forced to read this one for a class I took and I found it to be surprisingly helpful in some ways. Don't expect all the answers here."
4,Great Resource,This book was a big help to me. It was concise and helpful without being overbearing.
4,The Complete Handbook of Novel Writing: Everything You Need to Know About Creating & Selling Your Work,"Very practical and very readable. Not at all pedantic. Chapters are generally short, but packed with information. Book is being used as a text in a Writer's Digest class. Section breakdown by number of chapters: The craft (9), The art (8), The process (8), The genres (9), The marketplace (7), plus 14 interviews with current writers. The book is great, but surprisingly, it contains more than a few typos and grammatical errors!"
3,"Not a m ust-have, but not terrible","I've come to the conclusion that if you're looking for writing advice, inspiration and such, the way to go is to get books by single authors rather than collections that gather contributions from many. As an example of the latter this one isn't bad, but picking up two or three single-author books would be a better idea. Chances are at least one of those will work for you, and the consistency of a single author's approach is better than the frustration that can result from dipping into a grab-bag of often contradictory advice."
2,Would not buy it again,"I bought this CD and really I wish that I would not have. Wanted to have some of MJ's songs to remember him by. Don't like any songs but ""Butterflies."" All the other ones sound like previous songs, different words, same music. Sounds like a lot of space fillers to me."
2,Excellent Idea,Although the book is written by two Black authors it's not much different than Emily Post. I'd give it three stars but so much missing. For example it could have discussed how to visit other churches. AME Zion is not the same as a Baptist chuch and neither one is the same as a COGIC church. I would have loved to found out what to bring to a baby dedication...it's not the same as a baptism. There are so many events that are unique to Black life it's too bad the book doesn't address the etiquette required for them.
5,Right choice,The Name threw me but this was exactly what I wanted. It is small. It turns on only when it detects a signal from my apple TV. I hooked my Apple TV Digital outs to my main AMP for TV and 5.1 sound in the living room.I then used the standard RCA jacks of the apple TV for this. It sounds great. Much better than a cheap amp with more watts. The 40 watts are just 2 much for my 2 pair of speakers around the house. I turned the dials on the JS amp back to about 70% and the remote speakers sound great and fill the room with sound. I control everything from my iPhone. Way better than Sonos. The iPhone is far better a remote than anything Sonus will ever develop.
4,Another One That's Stonesy To My Ears,"Another CD that's a bit Stonesy to my ears - check out Freakshow and the guitar bit. Carnival Lights would be just another period drone piece, but listen to the vocal. It has grit - and a Hey Jude namecheck - which is more than I expected."
3,Screw Hooks,"I couldn't find these items in my local store so I had to resort to going on line and finding them. The product was exactly what I needed for my project but there was only one color offered. Additionally, I snapped a hook while screwing it into the wall."
1,Exercise Ball,"The execise ball is good quality. However, I purchased two (his & hers) and one was missing the ""stopper"". I tried to get the company to send me one and they never did and also never responded. Poor customer service!! I would not buy anything from this vendor again. Too bad - the product was great."
2,Not very good.,"I first looked at the sample report online. It was great -- lots of useful information to prepare for retirement, including some very good investment ideas. So I subscribed, and have now received several issues. There are sometimes some good information, but for the most part it is worthless. For example, in the January 2011 isue, 4 out of 20 pages was dedicated to turbulent times for long term care insurance that read more like a news article than true advice for what I should do. Another 4 pages were full page ads for banks, investment products, etc. The rest is what I would call useless fluff. By the way, Kiplinger, I am paying for this report -- why so many ads? Anyhow, There is usually some semi-useful info in the report, but definitely not worth the cost."
2,Kiplinger's Retirement Report,"I've always been pleased with the depth and coverage of Kiplinger magazine and reports. However, this time I'm a little disappointed.The Retirement Report costs significantly more than the magazine but didn't seem to give me an appropriate value. True, is that I've only reviewed one issue and they may have had the summer doldrums, so before you put your money down look for an issue you can study to see if it covers what you want it to... unfortunately I didn't take my own advice... shame on me."
1,Good for nursing home residents,"I subscribed to Kiplinger's Retirement Report several years ago, but decided to give it a try again. The magazine, if that's what you call a 20 page publication with 4 pages devoted to one page ads, is written for individuals who are in or near ""the end of life"" stage. The articles deal with conserving the money you have, provide interest rates that aren't even close to the highest insured rates available. They never give ideas for travel or things to do outside of your home or with grandchildren. The best and only section I ever got any thing from was the questions asked by readers section and that is kept to one page. I guess the Editors feel there is no point in expanding the one good section this brochure does have. I would recommend you save your money and Not subscribe to this publication. I suggest, instead, you subscribe to a real magazine with information you can use every month Kiplinger's Personal Finance a much superior publication for half the price."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Rose","This film will probably ring true for many of the millions of people who are living with, or have a loved one who has experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI), or any type of injury or illness that has stolen their gifts and talents. As you watch the life story of the protagonist, Oakley Hall, unfold, you will probably begin to ask yourself some difficult and often painful questions about who you really are and what truly defines you--questions that everyone should attempt to answer even if they have not been challenged with a life-changing injury or illness. I recommend you take the time to view this film. You will have the opportunity to learn something by doing so."
5,This game is fun especially when you have many players,"This game is really fun, especially with many players. First, you can have a lot of money and you think you are going to win the game but then... your luck goes away and somebody else gets all your money :) The only thing this game can become too long, since the brick are not so easy to get and they are very expensive. But overall it's a good game, I'd recommend it."
3,A Ho Hum Bible Game,"We played one game and it was at the beginner level, so things may change when we get to the advanced level. The most ""educational"" this game offered was ""Name John 3:16"" and ""Name 15 cities on the board""---that's it. My personal feeling (at this point) is this: keep Monopoly Monopoly and Bible games, strictly that, Bible games. When you mix the two, you do both games an injustice.We will play the game on the advanced level to see if it's any better; but at this point I'd rather play Monopoly and find a different Bible game to play."
4,I love Bible-centered options!,"I like to play board games, anyway, and I love it that I can have fun while having the fun be about God. Thanks for the alternative for church game night!"
1,Amazon's shame representation,"Amazon is claming:* Great entry-level charger system* Charges four AA / AAA NiMH batteries in 6-10 hours* Includes four 2300mAh NiMH AA batteriesIt is only 1800mAh which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards, while if it was as Amazon claims it would have been a nice step up. Shame on Amazon, oversight or misrepresentation. Charger is cheaply made. It can charge 4 AA or only 2 AAA. Poor design. The charger that came with my camera can do 4 AAA, go figure. Get something else."
3,I can charge 2 AA batteries,"I have this charger, it will charge 2 AA batteries, but they must be in the 2 center slots. As far as I can tell, it works fine...I don't require state of the art."
4,does the job,"this charger does the job not fancy but does the job, it can charge 2 or 4 AA batteries and 2 AAA batteries ,its not fast about 6.5 hours to charge 2 AA batteries and same time for the 2 AAA batteries , 4 AA batteries take 8 hours, the only problem i found with this model is if you use all 4 AA batteries it wont balance well on wall socket, but in all it does the job very well and saves you MONEY !!"
2,Warning to overseas travelers; worthless batteries,"This unit works fine in the US, charging four batteries in 5-6 hours. Though it's rated up to 240V, it fried out on Korea's 220V. It didn't die completely, just became extremely hot, smelled like smoke, and finally shut itself off. It did this a number of times and I gave up on it.The batteries that come with the charger are worthless--fully charged, I took three pictures and my camera said ""low battery""! The same thing happened to a friend--at Iguazu Falls, Argentina!"
1,Disappointing,"The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me. In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine. I was however, disappointed in the charger. The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work. You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable. Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best."
5,Time does not dull the message,"As I watched the 2000 Olympics, I was compeled to dig out my old copy of The Front Runner, complete with the olympic rings on the front. I first read this book in college....and I find that after 24 years this book still rings true. A tale of both an athlete's desire to attain his best and to come to grips with his sexuality. A story of trust and friendship. A book that moved me to tears as I read the final chapters. This is a wonderful book."
5,Still Running,"I first read this book in the mid '80s. It was loaned to me by my best friend who insisted that I read every word. I did, and it became my all-time favorite. Since then I've recommended it to almost everyone who's come into my life, and they've all welcomed it as one of the finest reads around. Nobody I know, straight or gay, has been able make it through the last few chapters without realizing how much they've embraced these characters to their hearts. I've bought and given away so many of my own copies that I've stopped counting. Simply one of the best books ever written."
4,Moving,"I've heard of this book for many years, and I just got around to reading it. (And I'm very glad I did!) It's a fast, easy read that grabs your interest immediately. Characters are well-developed, dialogue is believable and the plot is engaging. It's a touching and moving story that reminds us both how far we've come in twenty years, and also how far we still have to go. I found no trouble transferring the plot to present day, and that's very disturbing to me. I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it."
5,The Front Runner is the most moving book I ever read.,"A friend told me recently to read The Front Runner. He said it was an erotic book but not meant to be that way. It is a book of love, true gay love. I could not put the book down. The more erotic parts just made me cry. I felt so moved and good for the characters. But of course the ending at the 5,000 final tore me apart. I highly rcommend the book but also recommend a box of kleenex to go with it!"
2,Tremendous Disappointment for Runners,"After hearing the hype on this book as a great literary work for running enthusiasts and ""groundbreaking"" historically for the gay movement of the 1970s, I admit I was tremendously disappointed by this novel (inexpensively printed with typos!). What was revolutionary in the days of Stonewall and Bette Midler just reads corny today and this is like a long, gay version of a Harlequin romance novel.There's actually very little to do with the sport of running...and I held out for the famous ""Chapter 18"" which was selected as one of the great stories of Men's Sports. It's the best chapter in the book, so you may want to just read that and skip the rest unless you're looking for a soap opera, with an admittedly good plot twist at the climax."
2,typos,"I was surprised of the book's paper stock, the typos & the lines that were not always straight across, some slanted . Not a good value for $25.00."
2,Monotonous,"This novel started off well. I loved the struggles and conflicts both the coach and the team members experienced, but as the story progressed one expected the energy to rise, the intensity to some house start to increase, but instead the prose takes on such a monotonous and static tone that one finds oneself struggling to even finish the novel. It is well constructed as well as pretty tightly constructed, but it really offers little new to the books out there already. Although it is written by one of the forefront authors for the gay man in that time, I don't think it still has the same appeal to today's reader."
3,"A Good Pep Talk, But Not Classic Literature","This is a novel about the difficulties gays -- and in particular, gay atheletes -- faced in the 1970s. The main characters overcome adversity in the sports world and manage to keep a loving, monogamous relationship, although terrible things still happen. I think it's easy for a lot of gay men to love this book because it speaks to their values with a lot of hope and idealism. And so, as a kind of pep talk to the gay rights movement I think it serves its purpose. But once it's taken out of its ""pep talk"" context I think it falls flat, because its hopefulness and idealism then come across as silly and naive."
1,Predictable,"Y'know, I get that this is a novel that is supposed to be about gay men for a gay male audience. But, even so, the sheer misogyny is astounding. All the women in this book are characterized as shrill harpies in some way, shape, or form - even the lesbian character who supports the main characters! It was so obvious and over the top, I couldn't manage to finish the book.The book also suffers from obvious plot revelations. Things happen that one can see one hundred miles off - really, only the character who is the narrator's lover actually decides to try for the Olympics? What a shock!Also - is Ms. Warren actually a runner? Even slightly? Because THAT would be shocking.Pick something better; there's been 40+ years of gay fiction since, and I'm positive there is much more redeeming stuff to be found than this junk."
1,not up to the hype,"I was very dissapointed in this book. The main character is a very unlikeable person. The story is so seventies, too much sports jargon. Groundbreaking gay novel? No. This woman does not understand men the way someone like Annie Proulx did in Brokeback Mountain. It might make a good movie with the right cast. Don't waste your time."
3,Adequate but disappointing,"If you are new to the special education process (as my family is), this is a reasonable first book. It provides an overview of the process, and also includes the new law (IDEA 2004). However, I think it paints an exceptionally rosy picture of the whole process, and glosses over what happens when you don't happen to agree with the school district. If you reach this point, check out the Wrightslaw books (I would start with the ""From Emotions to Advocacy"" one.) Those books are narrower in scope, and so don't provide the breadth that this one does, but is (in my opinion) a little more realistic about the actual nuts and bolts of extracting a ""free and appropriate"" public education from your local school district."
4,Great book for new and Experienced teacher alike!,"I am a graduate student for sped but have worked for years in the field. This is an excellent book for helping teachers to organize and structure their classrooms so that every child has the opportunity for success. I have worked with lots of different needs and used a lot of the techniques she discusses in the book, but often we tend to give up on good techniques because it's just logistically hard to implement in the classroom. This book helps to show you how to make life much easier for you and your students and implement things like picture icons and color coding systems in a way that you can actually use. I also like that there were forms on the CD that could be used instead of having to re-type them from examples in the book. Great book!! Very Helpful!"
5,Amazon best buys on the internet,"I searched everywhere for this and could not find this game, and it was on the top of my grandson's xmas wish list. He was estatic when he opened it and I did'nt spend too much ! Thank you Amazon for a great gift easy pay and ""fast"" delivery. I will always go to Amazon for gift and personal shopping ...."
4,One of her BEST,"I wasn's sure I wanted to read this book. I bought it months ago and let it sit on the shelf. Finally I picked it up started to read it and it started out just as slow as the prequels but interesting. In the end I was glad I finished the book. I was glad to read about Liberty and Jarrett who finally got married after all they went through in the other sequels. For the truth to finally come out about the parentage of two women with amazing like features but two different last names. Now that the mystery is solved about the lineage of Liberty Sutton and Elizabeth Wilkins will the sequel with Maya, Lance, and Shannon be next. And what about Tyke. Will Mykel ever get out of jail and be forgiven and will he every find love. Take your time with the sequel and give us book(s) as hot as this one."
2,Luke-Warm,"I am usually a fan of acoustic efforts from bands. They have a certain feeling that you cannot get from any other form of the song. In the case of this perticular EP, I got a very weak feeling. While I am a huge fan of Motion City Soundtrack, and do own and enjoy Matchbook Romance's Stories and Alibis, this record does not meet my expectations from either of the bands. Both the Matchbook Romance songs are weakly sung and Motion City Soundtrack lack their usual energy. ""When You're Around"" is really the only stand out song on the entire record. But clearly not worth the purchase price. If you're looking for a good record from either of these bands, stick to their major label debutes ""I Am The Movie"", and ""Stories and Alibis"", as you will be much happier."
3,i only give this a 3 b/c....,matchbook romance ruins it...that guy CANNOT sing acoustically (???)...i mean i like MBR but they need not ever do this again....both motion city soundtrack songs are amazing and worth the 6$ ...plus the artwork is awesome and so is the actual cd (a clear cd) HA!
4,only one thing I really don't like about this album,"I love Motion City Soundtrack, I like Matchbook Romance, the songs are good (not my favorite, but still good) but since it's an EP it didn't need all of the space of the CD, so part of the CD was completely clear, which looks hella awesome, but confused the hell out of my old macbook's CD drive, making it near impossible to get out. That might be a silly reason to dislike the album, but that's the way it is."
3,great album,"This album is really great. It is supposed to show how they can still play unplugged.Matchbook Romance does a great job on switching to acoustic. In Transit (for you) starts off slow and switches to a louder sound one by one.With the song Playing for Keeps(Acoustic) they show how they can change it up a little bit. They show how dynamic they could be with different stylesMotion city soundtrack still has a little of punk in their hand. They our acoustic, but not really. They really on vocals to keep them up. The guitar parts are really messy.Matchbook Romance really took the part on this one. But overall these are too good bands, and this album is really good, so go check it out"
4,Exceptional,"Janette Oke is back. This book is one of the sweetest, poignant stories I've read in a while. It shows the ironies of life in a good light. A story that brings back tender moments, and the surprise of love just happening. A must read! Two thumbs up!"
2,The Matchmakers,"I generally enjoy novellas - but not so much this one - which is too bad because I've really enjoyed Janette Oke's longer historical fiction. I started out liking the book ok - Cynthia and Judith have a strong friendship and I enjoyed ""sitting in"" on their coffee shop visits. The attorney, ""P.C."" Weston, never felt like a real character to me...it's a good ways in the book before he even says anything. And though this book is a romance, that didn't feel real to me either. Not enough detail...and I've read enough novellas to know that you don't always get alot of details. Not my cup of tea."
2,Buy Hunting Unlimited 2 instead.,"I have most of the Deer Hunter series and 2005 is less than 2004. 04 had better graphics, better and more lifelike animals and you were able to access skills points easily, but not 2005. Save your money and buy Hunting Unlimited 2 instead."
3,Better yet,"Hey, Robert, instead of HU2, which is a bore, try Trophy Hunter or the Hunting Unlimited 3. The first Hunting Unlimited is great fun, and some work, but HU3 is very interactive. I spend hours on these games and will always come back to HU3 and the Trophy Hunter 2003."
1,Too Fake,This game is a complete waste of time. by far the most unrealistic hunting game ever.Anyone that has ever hunted will toss this game out quick.
5,Book as described.,"The delivery was prompt, and I have the book ready to give to a special sponsored child."
1,Readers of the Mahogany Soul Book Club Review,"This book had a very slow beginning. Although it did pick up in the middle, the ending was very disappointing. We do not recommend this book."
4,Enjoyed this book,"This was a book that kept me reading. I didn't think it was slow at the beginning as some reviewer had said. Interesting circumstances in this book. I do feel she left the door opened for sequel. I'd recommend this book, I'm in a bookclub and will suggest the other members read it."
1,Boring!,This book was boring and although it picked up in the middle it still did not make it any better.The Canfields are trying to find a place to build their dream home.The Betancourts move next door to them.Lisa Canfield use to be married to Brad Betancourt.Lisa's husband and Brad get along fine but Brad's wife Suzanne and Lisa don't like each other.Suzanne has a freeloading family.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.The Hickmans are nosy people who try to keep up with what everyone else has.The Hickmans were more interesting than the Betancourts and the Canfields.
2,Boring,This book have a very very very slow beginning lol. It pick up some what in the middle but still not enough to make u wanna keep the book in yo hands. I did like the end through how all the familys came together as one and let the past be the past. overall if you a fan of Bettye Griffin I would say go on an get this book if you don't have it. but if it is your first time reading from this author Bettye Griffin like myself then I would check it out from the library before buying.
2,i demand a refund,this book had a good storyline. i could have been really good. but it turned out to be a big snoozz
5,Loved It!!!!,"I really enjoyed reading The People Next Door. I couldn't put the book down. I was so into the book that I finished it in one day. Bettye Griffin, you did a wonderful job."
4,Jerry Herman at his Best,"Herman's most underrated show, with Robert Preston and a very young Bernadette Peters. Give it a listen!"
5,Great Musical,"I had never heard the songs, had never seen the show, but I really enjoyed this CD. Broadway is my favoritew and so if it is yours, you will enjoy this too. Now I have to see the show. The music and lyrics are by Jerry Herman and he has written wonderful musicals -- Mame is one of them and there are plenty. This show made Bernadette Peters into a star. I loved it."
1,Mack & Mable,The music to this Broadway Musical is good but the quality of what was sent was very poor!!!! This is not the first time I have received products from Amazon.com that the quality was not up to par. Wasted money on may items. I do not understand why I purchase movies and cd's.
4,Jerry Herman's finest score,"This show probably represents Jerry Herman's best work, even though (heartbreakingly) MACK AND MABEL wasn't a success in Broadway. There are a few weak songs (""Hundreds of Girls,"" for example), but otherwise the score is marvelous, and offers two beautiful songs which have since become cabaret standards: Mack Sennett's ""I Won't Send Roses"" and Mabel Normand's lovely melancholy ""Time Heals Everything.""Robert Preston is very fine as Mack Sennett, but the show's real sensation is Bernadette Peters as Mabel Normand. This was the role that first got her really noticed, and she's astonishing in all the many and very differing songs Mabel gets to sing--including my own favorite song from the show, the marvelously exuberant ""Look What Happened to Mabel."" Lisa Kirk, the original Lois Lane from KISS ME KATE, is also a knockout in her big number, ""Big Time."""
5,M&M,I was lucky enough to see this show in Washington DC. It was fantastic. So sorry that it wasn't successful. Get this CD. You'll love it.
2,I WON'T SEND ROSES,"A flop show, and a terrible waste of talent. Robert Preston, Bernadette Peters, and Lisa Kirk try to work wonders with weak songs and a weaker plot. Perhaps this would have been better as a silent movie."
3,V neck should be cut deeper,"The quality of these t-shirts is good. The only issue I have is that they are supposed to be V-neck. It is a V-neck, but the V is cut so shallow that it is almost a regular crew neck. I purchase V-neck t-shirts so that they don't show when I am wearing a shirt with an open collar. This one will show."
4,Great,"This was a good purchase, In fact i am wearing it now..only thing is that it wasnt the colour the site originally showed me .besides that is is thick and strong ..."
5,Another Simenon winner,"If you like Simenon, you'll like this...I have over 300 by this author and have not been disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money,This book claims to be for an Immigration Enforcement Agent. It really does not provide any help. The material seems to be outdated. Some of the pages looked like they been taken from some older tests. Don't waste your money!
5,Very practical and TONS of information!,"We are looking to migrate to Australia and wanted to do our research. This book gives practical information on everything from visas to schools to jobs. It gives lots of useful facts that will help anyone looking to move to Australia - such as your drivers license is generally accepted for up to one year, you don't have to get a new one until then! Info on car insurance, cable and phone companies, bus routes, ferry service, PHONE NUMBERS AND WEBSITES! This is THE book to get if you are going to be moving to Australia or visiting long term. Hands down."
1,Poor container design,"I love the shake, but the carton opening design is faulty. I have ordered this twice from Amazon. In the first shipment, two of the containers had opened and spilled their contents. In the second, there were four failures."
4,Really like this stuff,"I use this as meal replacement near exercise(sometimes before sometimes after, sometimes both!)I love the taste, and while yes, there can be lumpy stuff in there, to me it's like a lumpy milkshake, as the lumps taste exactly the same as the rest of the stuff.After a good workout, it feels good going down and this stuff satisfies me quite nicely."
2,Paper cartons leak,"I really like Muscle Milk and have ordered it on a regular basis for several years. Recently, they stopped selling the plastic bottles and switched to these cardboard cartons. I drink one on the way to work each morning and invariably, the cartons leak. I used to get caught off guard and would spill some of the drink on my shirt or on the cup holder in my car, but now I carry a paper towel around the carton. The manufacturers have to know of this problem, because all of the cartons leak, but they seem to be pushing these containers. Wish they would offer the plastic bottles online."
1,warning,"According to an independent investigation in 2010 from a particular magazine, consuming 3 servings of chocolate Muscle Milk delivers on average 12.2 micrograms of arsenic, 5.6 microgram of cadmium, and 13.5 microgram of lead. The proposed US federal limit is 15 microgram of arsenic, 5 microgram of cadmium, and 10 microgram of lead per day.Some other products from some other brands have similar issues; so you should do your research before deciding to daily drink excessive amounts."
1,Battery does not power up USB devices standalone,"The reason I bought this product is so that I could power up USB devices and the hub with the included batteries. Unfortunately, the hub will not power any devices I tried nor operate as a hub without drawing power from a laptop or PC. The manual states that the red LED will extinguish when the batteries have discharged. However, even when I removed the batteries, the red LED remained on. Basically, there does not seem to be any way to determine if the batteries are doing anything. I am still looking for a true battery powered hub."
2,Not Recommended,"I don't recommend this unit for the following reasons:1) The precision of the case is quite poor. I was almost unable to open the battery cover. I finally used my Swiss Knife to modify the battery cover to resolve the problem.2) The battery indicator is only passive (switch on/off indicator only) and cannot tell you if the batteries are in use or not. Even without the batteries, the indicator can be still on. I cannot confidently say that this device does not draw power from my vulnerable VAIO UX280.3) When using the Sennheiser USB adaptor on this device, the audio quality was significantly degraded. I assume that this device cannot keep data flow fast enough."
2,Its ok,"Really, it was ok if your usb stuff did not need power.Adding an extra keyboard or mouse is ok, but you need the battery power to run your other things.I also ended up giving it to goodwill."
1,sux,This item has never worked even with pre-charged batteries installed.Amazon wanted more in return shipping than it cost; it is now only a hub and I use the batteries in other devices. Would have given it zero stars but Amazon wouldn't let me.
2,"It works but doesn't provide power really, it's a silly concept.","Imagine you have your USB device plugged into this thing for extra power and you need a bit of extra power for those surround sound USB headphones. Well the idea of the batteries charged up to help with the device sounds good, but it's really silly. Since a USB power cord can't power up the headphones well enough then how you you expect the battery to help do it when it will just drain in like 1 hours time of extra useage. The battery can't recharge while it's be overwhelmed and drained of the extra power the USB can't put out enough power as it is for the headphones alone let alone how is it going to recharge these while it's still in use also.The batteries in mine where over heating to the point I was affraid to use it anymore, Cyberpower sent me a 110v powered plug in stand alone hub as a replacement."
4,"Good ""Adventure"" - - -",Gann uses real people and places in this exciting story of two men who share the love of flying - one more reckless and wild than the other. Story takes place from nearly the dawn of aviation to the era of the big airlines. Good story line and better characters. A page turner.
5,Love It!,The sign came quick and looks just like the picture. I can't wait to put it up in my garage.
1,Gold of the Seven Saints,"I read somewhere that there might be issues with these 'manufactured by order DVD-Rs' and that is correct. We cannot get this one or 'Yellowstone Kelly' to play.Would have rated it zero stars, but that option is unavailable. We love Clint Walker and are very disappointed.With that said we recently ordered an item from Amazon that was $144. They 'confused' our account info and the order did not go thru. When we went to resubmit the order the price was way over $200. Especially interesting to me since this was the first order mix-up we've ever had with Amazon. When I asked them about this via email I received no reply."
4,used briefly,I USED IT ONLY ONCE SO FAR AND DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO GET INTO ALL THE FEATURES...BUT IT ACTED WELL AND I WAS IMPRESSED...
3,Good but Slow,Works well for the price. Was slow when turned on to locate my location and to route. Otherwise it is a good value.
2,Magellan 4040,"I bought this item the last time I saw it on sale. At first I was very happy, while in the US on the I-5. When I went on 3 secondary highways there was no information available on points of interest. When I got to Canada I found out there were no maps and I could not add Canada or Mexico maps. I am very disappointed. Now I am in Canada so can't even take the *#@* back. Garmin comes with the maps for Canada and you can buy the ones for Mexico.UPDATE- I have used this system for about 2 months in total. The screen has finger prints inside it as if the pixels have fallen out. It is very difficult to see now."
3,Magellen 4040,Very easy to set up. This is my first GPS so far accuracy is 100% on. I use it for driving to meetings and appointments very easy to find locations and input information. The unit is very accurate with turn by turn instructions and sounds a chime just before a turn. The AAA information is awsome for finding a starbucks a hospital or restauraunt while on the road that was the reason I purchased this unit and I was not dissapointed. (your hungry on the road family will thank you for it) If you do not have one and travel for work get and or with family get a GPS now trust me on this.
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I received the Magellan Maestro 4040 for my birthday in Feb. last year. After about 5 months, the voice completely stopped working. I called the technical help line, but they insisted that I need the proof of purchase, which I don't have because it was a gift. They also told me I could update it if I bought some SD memory. I wasn't sure why I needed to buy memory, though. I understand that this is their policy, But my mother-in-law paid over $300 for this, and it broke in less than a year. I will never buy a product from them again!"
4,Magellan Maestro 4040.,"Maps are pretty accurate and the ""mobilty"" of the device a nice extra. Really like the blue tooth feature - works great with my all the families cell phones. Whenever we go somewhere as a family its a race to see which cell phone gets connected to the hands free feature of the 4040...A good product - excellent value for money."
2,Doesn't do all of the functions you would expect from a GPS,"This is my first time getting a personal GPS - my car has a built in GPS system (Toyota). So saying that, I based a lot of my opinion on what I am able to do with my built in GPS.First, one of the biggest things I hated about this unit was the ability to navigate the map around. The only option is to scroll out - which doesn't give you the detail you may want. I use this function a lot if I am trying to see if a smaller street is a better detour to get around traffic.The other thing I really, really hated is that the maps are very, very outdated. My home development was built in 2005 and it doesn't even show these! So if you are in a new development, forget it on this."
1,Poor Customer Service and Out of Date MAP... dont buy it,"I purchased this unit FACTORY REFERB. After testing it out, I realiezed the MAP on the GPS is out of date 5+ years old. I called the Magellan Customer support and recevied the following e-mail.******We do regret to inform you, but we will not be able to provide the 2008/2009 free of charge as the unit is refurbished. Refurbished units are sold as is. Per our policy, we can only provide the map update free of charge (customer would be responsible for the $10.00 shipping charge for orders shipped with in the US or $26.00 for an international order) for new units purchased within the last 30 days. We do apologize for any inconvenience.***The GPS is bascially worthless without the updated MAP. I returned the unit immediately. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!"
1,Never got to find out how good it is...,"Ordered the refurbished 4040 as an Amazon ""deal"". Unit looks to be perfect cosmetically, but it won't hold a charge. After hours of charging, it only reads two bars out of five. Back it goes, for refund. Never buying refurbished electronics again..."
1,Comparing Nav's,This is a sub-par navigation system. I bought this unit and a garmin nuvi 200w and the winner in every category is the nuvi. The time it takes to pick up satelites is poor compared to the quick time from the garmin. The garmin is much more user friendly and took only an hour or so of playing with it before I felt like a pro.Forget all the other brands GET A GARMIN you will be glad you did!!!!!!!!
1,poor delivery-broken in the box,"bought this product thru Amazon Prime and 2 day shipping on DEc 16. It arrived Dec 29 by DHL, 10 days late and obviously too late for Christmas. Plugged it in to charge the battery and the AC adapter connection was loose and the battery wouldnt charge. NOT HAPPY!"
3,Refurbished GPS works great!,"This item was purchased as a replacement for the same model GPS unit stolen from my daughter's car. It arrived promptly and works great!As you may or may not know, Magellan GPS units are wonderful, but their Customer Service is the worst in the industry, by far. If you never have anything go wrong with one of their units, you'll do fine. If you *do* have something go wrong, or even just require their help to set up software, etc., then God Help You ...This is why I've given the unit only 3 stars. 5 stars for the unit, and *0* for Magellan as a company."
1,Unit shipped with wrong mounting bracket,"Although the 4040 itself is a very nice GPS, Megellan packaged the wrong mounting bracket with the unit, this means you can't use it in the car. Amazon was nice enough to replace the first one via overnight shipping but the replacement unit had the same bad bracket. Called Megellan, first they promised to send the correct part overnight - did not come. Then they said it was on backorder and had no idea when it would be availible. I can't recommed anyone buy this unit until Megellan recalls the bad units and starts shipping good ones."
2,Map rip off!,"A very fine GPS, however my nearly new unit requires a 2008/09 map update.Ok,I bought it a few months before the update, but I discovered it has a 2006 map onboard. I should not have to pay $75 for the update on an 8 month old unit. Shouldn't this be included for the first year?"
2,Good when it actually works,"I bought this GPS for the bluetooth and street names. If I had it to do over I would buy another brand. It would be nice to be able to change the voice but that's petty. I have bigger reasons for being unhappy with it:- a major local highway extension built almost 2 years ago not on the map.- the unit started having issues with the power adapter, the connection is loose and if the contact isn't perfect I get the message that it is switching to battery power. This blue screen pops up constantly and has gotten so annoying I can no longer use it.- Customer Service is horrible. I contacted them about my problem and got a vague scripted reply telling me to reset the unit. I replied that it didn't help and didn't hear back. A subsequent email still got no response. At this point I'm inclined to toss it in the trash but it would be an expensive loss.I will never buy another Magellan. Buy a Garmin or Tom Tom."
4,nice for a small unit,"This is a nice unit but isn't as user friendly as I would like, hard at times to find the Menus you need to navigate. Have a laptop unit that is easier to use and a lot more info. But is great once you get the hang of it. Instruction book not much help. More accurate than the laptop! Overall well worth the money!"
4,Nice unit for the refurbished price,This GPS is very user friendly and loud compared to my Navigon 5100. It has text to speech and AAA(Additional Subscription Charge) You can definitely hear this gps while driving especially with an aftermarket exhaust system.
1,Couldn't get it to work,Read the reviews. Did my research. Thought buying the Magellan 4040 was a good idea. I opened the package and could not get it passed the first screen. The GPS kept freezing. Very disappointed. Not sure about buying a refurbished GPS. There's a reason the first owner returned it...right?
4,gps works great!,"The unit worked great right out of the box. The Magellan customer service was great as well, I was able to get the latest map up-grade free of charge. It's very easy to use and accurate as well. Much better than any other gps I've had in the past. The widescreen really is a great feature also. Two thumbs way up. thanks"
1,magellan accessories,"I received a Magellan 4250 for Fathers' Day. A week later the car charger/FM wire fell apart. I ordered two chargers online from their website three weeks ago. It's still not here and they give the ""foreign customer service"" runaround when you try to find out where your stuff is.Kind of like Dell. Really bad service."
4,"So happy with the first one, bought it again","I travel (via car) for a living. Over the past 4 years I have had a Garmin 330, a Tom Tom 792 (?), a Garmin Nuvi 650 and a Magellan 4040. Not one of them was perfect under all conditions or in all cities I travel but the Magellan 4040 did most of the basic GPS functions better than any of the others.On a recent trip to New England, US Aiarways was good enought to drop my suitcase in a matter that destroyed my 4040 (cracked the screen and LCD. Had to buy a new GPS and decided to buy the same one again, the Magellan 4040.The most important reason I bought the Magellan again was the ability to access most common functions with less button (touch-screen pushes)pushing than the Garmin units. Entering addresses is easier and the automatic split-screen turn display is very useful. Think about this, the less buttons you have to push, the more time your eyes are on the road at 70 MPH.Also, the ""AAA Tourbook"" is a great plus."
4,Absolutely Amazing GPS Unit!,"Picked up this little gem from Costco a few days ago for $299 ahead of a long Thanksgiving trip in the car. As a frequent user of Hertz NeverLost during business travel, I knew I couldn't go wrong with Magellan, and I was right! Easy to enter an address and get going within 60 seconds. Locks onto satellites very quickly. Screen is easy to read in bright sunlight, as well as at night. AAA Tourbook integration is a nice plus- I like it more than I thought I would. Easy-to-use user interface, excellent speech clarity, navigational accuracy, ability to announce street names of upcoming turns, split-screen views before upcoming maneuvers, Bluetooth integration, and upgrade options make this GPS the one to beat. Don't know how I got along all these years without one of these in the car."
4,Very valuable,"Worked perfectly right out of the box. very pleased that it reduces stress of traveling. I got a ""proclip"" dash mounting which keeps it out of the windshield. Out of the box it is ready for an online software upgrade. I have a mac and the upgrade requires windows. That is the only reason I give four stars rather than five."
5,Very Excellent service and product.,I ALWAYS RECEIVED A GOOD SERVICES AND GOOD PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON.COMTHANK YOU VERY MUCHDJOULDE SOW
3,Get you there inefficiently...,"We chose this because it's a lot like the one we purchased via Costco but they no longer sell it. The difference with this one is that when we updated the card, it takes us on crazy routes. Round about ways that takes more time rather then ""fastest time"". Maybe we just need to do another update but I don't have that problem with my other from Costco. But if you don't know where you're going, it'll get you there. Just can't say it will be the most efficient route."
4,Great item weak software,"The Magellan works well, and has great features, but it gets confused and has you go in circles to get to some places. I have used it on several trips and it has worked well. But at times it wanted to take me around the block to get back to where I was at the time. Not certain why but it has happened more than 4 times on one trip to San Diego. Does not always get you to the location you want, some times off by more than a mile in rural areas. In all inspire of short falls it is an amazing piece of technology."
3,Perfect for what it was made for.,"It does what it says. I hate that they always send you down toll roads for everything. Online maps do the same thing so, it isn't that new to me. Crisp clear voice and the big screen is beautiful. Hope it stays that way over the years. Fastest time isn't always the fastest. I would like more personal options like changing the voice or more tones to choose from."
4,very pleased,"I researched GPS units for about 6 months, before I bought this unit. I wanted a 4.3 inch screen, text to speech and did not want to break the bank to own one. This unit has far exceeded my expectations. I am very pleased. I like the larger screen and the txt to speech. I would recomend this unit."
2,So-so device,"I guess it's good for the price; I bought it used, but it's difficult to get it to do what you want. Also, sometimes it won't respond to your touch. I'm not that thrilled."
4,it works great eccept does not show speed of travle while navigating,i like to see the speed of travle this gps don't show that while navigating othere wise it is great and fast
5,Maestro does everything I want it to,"I happened to go to Canada and Hawaii this year, so I wanted to pick up a GPS that had those maps. After searching for a bit, I found this unit on Amazon for about $80.It does everything I expect it to including:text to speechAlaska (haven't tried), Hawaii, and Canada mapsa lot of Points of InterestI like that it can figures out my current location fairly quickly. It seemed to take my Navigon 5-10 minutes to pinpoint the current location.One negative is the user interface isn't as intuitive as some other GPS systems I've used. If I don't use it for a few weeks, I forget how to save new locations.Overall, great value for the money."
3,ok product,I have used it few times. once it could not even find the location. I had to use the mapquest despite having the GPS with me. 3 hours batter life is just a big scam. It only lasts for few minsmounting kit way too big.
3,GOOD PRODUCT /BAD SUPPORT,"Very good GPS unit but I had purchased a Magellan 4000 and it crapped out on me. I had just recently paid 79.00 for the updated maps and lost it in the 4000. I contacted Magellan directly but they refused to help; therefore, I was out 79.00This is a reflection on Magellan and not Amazon. It has been a good unit so far, nevertheless."
3,not completely accurate,"I'm disappointed at times with the accuracy of this unit. Many times roads or streets are not in the program. This, in spite of getting the latest update. That in itself was a hassle to get the free update (which cost $10.00). I spent over two weeks trying to resolve the issue and I'm not sure I actually got the update that was labeled. I can't tell the difference from the original.I would recommend checking out other units before the purchase of this one."
1,Worst customer service in the universe,"Not only did this product malfunction (which I suppose could happen to anyone) but my experience with what passes for ""customer service"" was bizarre to say the least. In summary after being told I would receieve service in 2 days, then 7-10 business days and then finally being told (as God is my witness this is true) ""the repair department has been shut down for maintenace for two weeks"" the most amazing thing is no one at anytime ever apologized or expressed the slightest bit of concern over the fact they have now had my $500+ GPS for going on one month. This is what passes for ""customer service"" at Magellan.During the wait I have purchased a Garmin Nuvi 650 and it works just fine so if you are looking I would strongly advise you stay away from Magellan products because if you ever need ""customer service"" you will be in for one very rude experience."
4,Huge upgrade over my last Magellan Roadmate,"This was an upgrade to the Magellan Roadmate 300 (which I thought worked fine but my wife wanted to use it in her car). The touch screen which was gimpy on the 300 works really well on the Maestro. I don't find the text to speech to sound weird, but sometimes it takes the unit forever to say everything it wants to say and you've already made the turn. Still...I do prefer that it nows says the name of the street. Sadly, the unit does not have the UK voice setting (I actually preferred the english accent which was an option on the Roadmate). The unit is up and running as soon as you turn it on - where as the Roadmate took a few minutes to figure out where it was. The unit is a breeze to type in the address. One complaint however is that the suction arm kind of squeeks when the road is bumpy - the Roadmate did not do that."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"The GPS accuracy is extremely good. The ""directions"" that it selects are quite logical depending on the choices you have made. The voice prompts are loud and easy to understand. The screen is large and works well in both day and night format. It re-calculates routes very fast if you do not follow it's original recommendation. I had read several good and bad reviews here, and now I am really glad that I chose Magellan 4040. For me it worked right out of the box, so I did not have reasons to go for customer service, hence can not comment on that.RD"
2,Love/Hate,"Love the GPS unit...Hate the Service. Had to return unit for service three months after I bought it. Magellan customer service is a joke. They issued a return label with the wrong repair center address, lost the unit somewhere in their facility and kept stalling before replacing. I had to call the CEO's office (partial satisfaction) and ultimately the office of the Chairman Of The Board before someone responded to my problem. At the end of the day, they replaced the unit and the new one works fine but it wasn't worth the hassle."
3,"Great for Basic Navigation, but....","Does a great job with basic navigation but is not compatible with Mac, a major disappointment. Has a tendency to use private ranch roads here in Texas when in shortest distance mode. Documentation is a bit shy...no mention of how to use the flash drive feature. Bluetooth works good."
4,Lots of Nice Features,"After my first day of use, I was frustrated because there was no way to look ahead and see where the chosen route takes you. Then I downloaded software upgrade 2.4 and it has some enhancements. You can now move quickly along a simulated route even before you start driving. But it still will not let you scroll in any direction at will to see what's around your location. You can, however, zoom out or in quite a bit (it just never seems to reveal the area I want to see). I've also read a very large number of negative reviews on another site...the customer support for Magellan is apparently beyond poor!The 4040 has a large screen, good spoken voice, clear 3D or 2D maps. A really great addition is AAA data, including points of interest, restaurants, including fast food. The unit grabs onto the satellite within 10 sec. when you start it up, and re-calculates changes to the route in 2-5 seconds. We used it the first day we bought it to help the Auto Club locate our stranded motorhome."
4,indispensable,"Can't imagine leaving home without it! Had a bit of problems locating specific stores/restaurants in the San Diego area, strangely no problems in Los Angeles. Very user friendly!"
1,Magellan Service is AWFUL!,I recently purchased a Maestro 4000. The unit was out of commission for about 50% of the time in the first two months I had it due to a bad battery (I think). I finally sent it in for service under the Magellan warranty. They have had the unit for about 2 months and I still don;t have it back. All attempts to get feedback from them end up in a frustrating telephone maze talking to people in India. I have simply given up on getting the unit repaired and returned. I strongly urge you to think twice about dealing with Magellan.
1,refurbished rip-off,"i bid on and won an item that was advertised as refurbished, but when it came, the item---a magellan maestro 4040 -----did not work and it was incomplete. the jack where the power cord connects was missing----it was just a hole in the plastic case and the memory chip which has all the maps and instructions,was missing.i have filed a claim with amazon and am waiting for a refund.iwould NEVER do business with these people again !"
3,Mixed bag,"The GPS is excellent. The screen is a good size, very readable. I chose this unit, in part, because of the Bluetooth which works fine, but the microphone is pretty poor making it almost useless as a speaker phone. Magellan Maestro 4040 Portable car navigation system with Bluetooth"
4,Maestro 4040,"I will never take a trip without this again. It is the most valuable tool you can have in an area you are unfamilar with.I bought the refurbished unit because it was very inexpensive. It came with every attachment I need, the mounts, plus wall and car chargers.As it was a refurbished unit the maps were 2006 versions. I ordered the 2007/2008 map upgrade. It was difficult to install the maps, but now the unit is up to date and still was a bargin."
4,Great deal at the price,"This GPS navigator proved easy to use quick to lock onto the satellites, quick to recalculate (often finished before we reached the end of the block after making a wrong turn!).The voice instructions were very helpful, but the bell when the turn is reached could have come a bit sooner.The maps are a little out of date, lacking some very recent changes, but this wasn't a big deal for me.For under $150, this is a completely satisfactory gadget!"
4,GPS,"This product so far as been reasonably acceptable. One small piece broke off of the docking station within the first week of use, but other than that it is working well."
5,Magellan Maestro 4040,"My wife and I have been very happy with this wonderful toy, ur huh, tool.Now, my wife does not get a migraine headache after we spend two to three days driving around looking for an address because I refuse to stop and ask directions. Instead, we get to hear, ""destination ahead in one tenth of a mile.""It did freeze up on us when we first purchased it, but resetting it took about 10 seconds and we have not had a problem since then. I am ready to download the new software so I can just say, ""hey maestro, take me to the grocery store in some town I have never been to before.""Great product. Great Price. No more ibuprofen for my wife."
2,no updates!,I would not recommend this product to anyone. I didn't think that roads change as much as they do. I used it in Orlando and almost shot it when it told me to go straight a bunch of miles when the entrance ramp was right there! The maps are so out of date - with no sign of being able to update. Also - to test -I had Magellan try to take me to known place - it had me turning away from the address right before reaching it! Save your money - I wish that I had - you'll do better with a printout from google maps!
2,Get Lost with the Maestro 4040,"The Maestro 4040 has poor mapping on the east coast. I'm not sure about other parts of the country. It gets me to the correct city, but I have to figure out how to find the correct street address on my own. It tells me to turn where there are no roads and has even told me to turn when I was driving over a bridge. I wasn't in a newly developed area either. The Nuvi 350 is just as bad. I have used a Magellan GPS on the west coast and it worked great. Something with a cost of over $400 should work reliably and accurately. Also, products that are sold for use in the USA should have a customer service line that is sufficiently covered by employees that speak English as a first language. If you are considering between the Nuvi and the Magellan, buy the Nuvi. It is a little easier to use and has customer service in the USA, but don't expect it to work any better. Until the maps are brought up to date these are junk."
2,"Great GPS , horrible map update policy","The 4040 has to me the perfect combo of features.The companies map update policy is horrible,if youdon't contact them within the first thirty days ofownership they will not give you a map update,didn'tnotice that the maps were 3 years old ,tough buyand update.This ruined what would have been the perfect GPSfor me,I am sending it back and going back to Garmin."
4,Magellan Maestro 4040,"The product, the actual GPS, is wonderful. We just came back from a vacation to Shenandoah National Park and never once had to rely on AAATrip Tik, which lately has been wrong. However, we had to duct tapethe GPS to the mounting bracket and the bracket was also duct taped tothe dashboard. Why, because the 4040 model number is very new and themounting hardware was for another model. Too bad the quality controldidn't catch that."
4,Very good test preperation,To pass those Oracle Exams is hard for a newbie anyways because the hand on experience is missing. I am one of these candidates but I have to say that this book is very helpful to get ready for the test. 95% of the topics needed for the exam are completely in this book and explained in a good understandable way. For the other 5% I have used the original Oracle training documents. After you have passed the exam this book is an awesome reference because topics are divided in a very usefully way and all topics have examples of the SQL commands and dictionary views.
4,"Enough to pass, i might even keep it","I passed the test with 51 right out of 60. This book definitely helped clear up some concepts I had been hazy on in the past, like the relationships between segments and extents. I might even keep it around as a reference just because it's got enough condensed info on a wide range of topics that it might prove useful at some point when I need to create a profile or a partitioned index.If you have the extra dough, spring for the practice tests at selftestsoftware.com. Some of those questions showed up almost word for word on the exam."
4,Not good enough,"I spent about one month almost every night preparing for the exam by only reading this book. Unfortunatly I failed the exam. There are a lot of topics just not explained clearly by the book, although the subjects are all covered. And if you want to pass the exam with a safe margin, you need to understand completely all the topics. With just this book, it can be difficult. I havn't read other exam prep books. But I think having a second book might be necessary. But overall, this book is probably better than others, and can be used as a base."
2,Not enough...,"the book itself is not that bad: it gave me an idea how oracle works, but the practise tests were miles behind the actual test questions. Keep this in mind if you're going to buy this book. (I got 70/73... !...)Alex"
2,Not enough depth for the newbie,"This book is crammed with good information for updating your skills from Oracle 8 to 9. But it lacks instructional depth for any newbie trying to learn oracle for the first time. It contains page after page of command line instructions with very little explanation of how all this information ties into understanding the database environment. It quickly begins to read like unix man pages and sql sample scripts. It's good information to commit to memory for a test, but look for other sources to learn oracle in more depth. If you're already experienced with Oracle 8, then this may be what your looking for. It just doesn't clearly cover the ""fundamentals"" for new comers to oracle in my opion."
1,Don't waste your money on this book. Unless......,"Don't waste your money on this book. Unless your looking for something to burn in your fireplace, and if you do burn it don't get down wind because you'll never get the stench out. I will certianly remember the names Biju Thomas & Bob Bryla next time I'm looking for a good study guide. This book is at the best incomplete. Too many simple questions that lead you to believe the exam will be similar. The more complex oracle study list topics are not explained at all."
4,Love Her!,I love this CD. I saw her open for Citizen Cope and bought her cd online that night when I got home. The only reason that I give her four stars instead of five is that she was SO fantastic live and I felt her cd could have been so much more. But its still an excellent cd.
4,Explicit Lyrics,"I purchased what I thought was a version of the For Lovers, Dreamers & Me cd containing no explicit lyrics since one was clearly labeled as having explicit lyrics in the title and the other was not. Listened to it today and found at least one song (Woodstock) has a word not suitable for the children to hear and repeat. Love the song and cd otherwise and I can't say I wouldn't have purchased it, just would have been nice to know in advance that it wasn't ""clean."""
4,Fresh and refreshing,"Nice change from the ""Pop Charts"" of today. Smooth voice. Intriguing lyrics and sound. My teenager listens to the CD for a fresh change of pace from time to time. I enjoy listening to Alice Smith when I'm hanging around the house or in the car.Great CD with a fresh new sound. Highly recommend!"
4,"Never heard of her before, now a fan","I purchased this CD without hearing one song from it. A few blogs that I visit had mentioned this album from a singer named Alice Smith, and from the reviews, it made me want to purchase. I am so glad that I did. I love this CD because of Smith's vocal range and singing, and because it is unlike anything else I have really heard. My favorites are Dream, Do I, Gary's Song, and Fake is the New Real."
5,"A unique, wonderful ride","Alice Smith sounds a lot like Res -- her voice is raspy and soulful and unique. But Smith must have better timing for her era, because ""For Lovers Dreamers and Me"" is just a seamless album of funky, hard-to-categorize tracks. It's good lounge music, for sure, and the lyrics are good blend of a cute carefree narrative (""Woodstock"") and hauntingly sad dirges (""Do I"".)It's hard to compare Alice Smith to anyone, but from listening to this album, she the American and sober heir to Amy Winehouse's throne for a beautiful and distinctive new voice that should be heard all over the world."
1,Anemic little magazine of a book,"This thing is really too small to be called a book. I noticed that before I bought it, but went ahead with the purchase because I thought that perhaps it would be REALLY concentrated. Much to my disappointment, that wasn't the case. This book is as bad as they come. First, the chapters are really just old magazine article reprints. Second, the techniques are obsolete -- why would I want to write a characteristic function when I can just use CASE? Self joins and cartesian products are also counter-intuitive, generally slow techniques. Maybe they work okay with 10 record tables, but what about 10,000? I think not. Don't be the fool that I was and waste your money on this book!"
1,"Impractical, poor-performing techniques","First, this 132 page ""book"" is really just a collection of SQL Forum magazine reprints from the early 90s. Second, the tricks introduced here have very little practical value. It seems the whole goal was to show what neato things could be done with a single SELECT statement. No thought is given to readability or performance. Cross joins in particular, a favorite technique of the authors, perform very poorly over large sets of data -- the very type of data sets people interested in these types of computations would likely have. Multiple nested subqueries of a given table constructed solely to avoid having multiple select statements are hardly performant. You will be much better served with Henderson's T-SQL Guru's Guide book. It shows how to perform row-positioning computations (such as statistics, runs, and so forth) in Transact-SQL without resorting to arcane, obscure techniques that perform poorly."
1,Techniques are impossible to read and unnecessary,"Not worth the cost at all in my opinion. The techniques demonstrated are obsolete (ever hear of CASE?), slow, and impossible to read. Skip this one."
1,Out-of-date and impractical,"The introduction of the CASE function in ANSI SQL '92 made characteristic functions all but obsolete. Not only that, but these techniques involve lots of non-performant techniques such as returning the Cartesian product of large tables. Cartesian prodructs are nearly always very, very slow with large amounts of data. Writing code like this will result in redicule by your co-developers. Don't waste your time or your money on this book."
1,Techniques shown are impractical at best,"The chief aim of a technical book should be to show how to do something. Technical books are ""how-to"" books -- that's why people buy them. I have no use for a book that demonstrates essoteric techniques that are next to useless in the real world. For it's price, this book has a very low value to the SQL practitioner. Recommend that you skip this one altogether."
3,CASE can't do pivots!,All of you who are saying that CASE makes characteristics obsolete: show me how to write a pivot query that does not use a temp table using the CASE function - and without having to hardcode the column headings! Avoiding a temp table can make a huge impact on the scalability of your application.To me - this was the only value of this book: the first three articles. The rest consisted of the esoterica described by the others.
1,Just a collection of obsolete magazine articles,"This tiny book is just a collection of old magazine articles -- even the ""chapters"" refer to themselves as ""articles."" Also, the techniques presented in the articles are not practical. If you write code like this, you'll be run out of town by others who have to work on your code. It reminds me of some of the weird let-me-show-you-how-clever-I-am MSDOS batch file techniques you used to see circulating. Time to try a new approach, fellas. I don't care how small the code is if it ain't readable. A little pile of dog poop is still a pile of dog poop."
4,This book has concise info on how to build good SQL,This book shows how to build better SQL. I find the info useful in building higher performance SQL statements.
1,Not worth the price,"At the price I paid, I would have expected this book to be more substantial. Instead, it's just a collection of reprints from SQL Forum. I'm not amused. Moreover, the techniques shown in these reprinted articles are rather obscure and difficult to read. I'd be hesitant to use them in my own code for fear of retribution by my team members. Other than limiting the number of SELECTs you write, I don't see any real advantage to them."
5,Fun reading.....and OH! so true!!!,"If you only have 5 seconds in the morning, grab this little book and get your ""high"" for the day. Cy has an wonderful understanding of men with her tongue in her cheek. It makes my day each day!"
1,Very bad indeed,"I found this book in a library in South Africa many years ago. I thought about it recently and decided to purchase it. When I started to read it I had the same feelings about it I had before - ""tongue in cheek book"", lively and engaging. After a chapter or two I realised (again!) that it actually is not ""tongue in cheek"" book and that the author is serious about the story, which is written really badly. I read another book by Susan Trott and it was as bad as this one."
5,Phyllis Witney is a long time favorite author...,"Janey has a disease she describes as ""horse fever"". This is a delightful mystery of a young girl in her early teens that falls in love with a horse owned by a cranky old neighbor, complete with two ""strange"" grandsons! Janey has to solve the mystery to gain the trust of her family. But just as the privilege of riding the lovely mare is within inches of her grasp, another plot twist has you sharing her dismay of ever riding, let alone owning her own horse; of course the ultimate goal!"
2,"Not bad, not great","I really wanted to either love this book, as a kind of nolstalgic re-living of my own horse-crazy, Nancy-Drew-reading pre-adolescent days, or hate it as an out-of-date, out-of-touch relic of the past. It is, however, not that easy. While most girls are more iPod or Blackberry-crazy than horse-crazy nowadays, I'm sure there are still some out there who can identify with the teenage girl heroine's ""horse fever."" The author obviously knows a thing or three about teenage girls and horses, and I appreciated those authentic touches that came through in her writing. Unfortunately, the ""mystery"" in the book is about as hard to figure out as a Scooby-Doo plot, makes just about as much sense, and unfolds in just as ridiculous of a fashion. I kept waiting for the ghost dog to turn out to be Scrappy-Doo. I would recommend this book for a much younger girl than the 14-year-old main character."
4,A Good Read,"Ruth survived the Holocaust, the only person in her family to do so. She simply feels empty. She shuts herself down and won't let herself feel emotion--she thinks it will hurt to much. Then, a man finds her. He is part of a secret organization that send Jews, many of who survived the Holocaust, to Palestine to start a new country. He asks if she will escort a group of orphans to Palestine. She accepts, for the main reason of not having anything else to do. The book is about hope, the realization that life is worth living, happiness, and a new life.It is a very interesting perspective. Often, people get caught-up in the horrors of the Holocaust and of the 6 million Jews that died. It is rare, however, that the life of those who survived is considered. It was, by no means, an easy life. This is historical fiction, but the author did research and tried to put all her research into the story. It is a wonderful book that should be read by everyone."
4,pretty good,"after the war is over all a good book. it shows how life and love changes in harsh situations, and love helps ant situation it also shows how attitudes change, and ones will can change, and pull someone through a hard time"
4,this is the coolest book ever!!!!!!!!!!,"i got to read this book when i picked a random book from the library. I think that was a dam good random choisce i made!!!When i started reading this book even looking at the first sentence of the book, it creates so much intensity and suspence that it is so addictive.i always fancied world war stories. Its been like my all time favourite setting for writing and reading books. Nearly half of the writing is related to the time during the world two or after. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!"
3,After the War,"This book, to me, wasn't all that clear on what happened after the war. When I first picked up the book, I was expecting to know what society was like once the war ended, but instead, I got a story just about a girl and her life after the war. In a way, it is a great book, because you get to know and see what she saw while trying to get the other children to safety and away from the violence. I personally don't think that I could have done what she did. Taking all of those other kids, even ones younger than herself, and traveling all over the place just to get away from gunshots and slave hunters. I highly recommend this book to anyone who just wants to get a first hand insight of what this young girl went through after the war."
5,One of the best topology texts with a less formal feel.,"I find many areas of this text as lucid and captivating as some of the most famous topology works. While I prefer Munkres' text in a classroom setting, Hocking and Young give an enjoyably different approach with more discussion in some interesting topics. It serves as possibly the best book for self teaching or quick reference."
4,Another Well-Written Installment in a Terrific Series,"I just discovered this series, and am really enjoying reading the books in order. In this one, Duncan and Gemma are asked to look into the mysterious death of the son-in-law of a well-known former opera singer and musical conductor. The family is no stranger to tragedy: Years earlier their young son had drowned, an event from which the family had never really recovered. Crombie does an excellent job depicting the book's characters, including the murder victim. I usually find that romance between two main characters in a detective novel detracts from the focus on plot, but Kincaid handles the growing attraction between Duncan and Gemma with restraint. I definitely recommend reading this book, and the others in the series."
3,Deborah Crombie is Overrated.,"This is the third Crombie book I've read, and I did enjoy this one marginally more than the other two. The story and plots and and counterplots were more detailed and more believable (for the first part of the book anyway). I agree with the others that the last part of the book bogs down a lot. Also, I'm sorry but Duncan Kincaid is a ""lame duck"" and I find I have trouble liking him. He seems to fall for any female that comes his way, and he seems to lack a spine. I do like Gemma though. She manages to carry the book, even though her infatuation with Duncan lessens her sensibiity somewhat. I am a huge British procedural fan, so I find that this series lacks authenticity and I never forget that it's not written by an English author. The book did have possibility though. The 20 year time frame, and unresolved issues helped pull it out of the mundane and make it somewhat interesting. But it's one-dimensional and forced (at least for the last 1/4 of the book anyway)."
2,The green grave bogged down....,"While this story began with an interesting murder, the middle 3/5 of the book dragged on and on. No clues to where Kincaid was heading, just endless discussions of clothes, tea sets, pub food....I really thought it would never end. Not my favorite of hers...the third I have read."
3,What happened,She had me hooked before the end of the first chapter. Great style and character development. That is for the first 3/4 of the book. The last 1/4 must have been written by a 13 year old without very much talent.
3,"Inauthentic and clumsy, yet oddly compelling","Deborah Crombie should not have chosen to make her protagonists Scotland Yard detectives. I love a good cozy mystery, and I love a good police procedural, but her books thus far try to be both and succeed at neither. Clumsy, too, in the way the author tries to paint the growing sexual tension between Kincaid and James and the growing sexual tension between Kincaid and every other attractive female who crosses his path. I think she can work out the clumsiness, but she needs either to find out how police departments really work, or switch over to pure cozy.On the other hand, after deciding that I couldn't stand to read any more in the series, I found the last chapter astonishingly poignant and compelling, so I will not give up on Crombie yet."
4,Atmospheric Mystery,"This has a moody, murky atmosphere. The parallel of the earlier drowning of a brother, and the later drowning of the husband of a main character create a kind of haunting connection. Are they connected? It doesn't help that Kincaid is attracted to the woman, a possible suspect. This is a fun read in the continuing development of Duncan's detecting prowress. You do want to tell him not to become emotionally involved with his suspects!"
1,The worst Emmanuelle film out there,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, and is definitely the worst Emanuelle film. If it was an action movie it would still be bad (lower end of B movie scale), not least because of the quality of the acting, but I thought the genre was supposed to be erotic. This is about as erotic as a mouldy tomato. Laura Gemser hardly features and when she does its as a woman wanting revenge for the murder of her grandfather, rather than as would be expected in an Emanuelle film. The only redeeming features, and this is why I give it one star rather than zero, are that Laura Gemser is beautiful, and the story is ok, but only ok. However its still not worth buying, or even watching on cable."
1,I do not recommend this book at all,"This book is definitley not worth considering if you want are trying to compose an effective cover letter. I have worked in human resources for several years and cover letters starting with either"" books are as important as bread..."" or ""have you not found that granting loans involves knowledge...""""I have been thinking of what else I might do to line up new buisiness opportunities..."" are just not even worth reading. They do not catch one's attention or at least not the kind of attention you want to attract.The examples provided in the book are nothing but very simple written sentences like""...I wish I had space to list all of my qualities...""- I mean what kind of an excuse is that to make a letter short? I cannot believe this book was recommended on an online job search. It is a joke!I sure hope this review gets posted as I do think bad reviews also have to be included to ensure the free marketplace of opinion! heikecita"
1,Get the book instead...,"Lindsay Porter and Peter Morgan's ""Guide to Purchase and D.I.Y. Restoration of the Porsche 911"" is really what you really want! Their excellent (print) guide to the 911 gets right down to the nitty gritty including the model history and nearly priceless help in evaluating a used 911. The video is pure disappointment, beginning with the opening shots. Awful sound quality and mediocre camera shots of one of the world's most interesting cars can't help but leave a sour after-taste. Expecting some historic footage of the 911 (perhaps something from a Monte or LeMans?) or a lovely selection of exterior shots with that unmistakable circular-saw-through-cotton-wool engine sound? Sadly, they're all absent without leave from this video."
3,It gets me where I need to be,"As far as wheelchairs go this one does exactly what it is intended to do; it gets you where you're going. It folds for easy transport in the trunk of a car, and the footrests detach to make that storage easier.I added a cushion to make up for the lack of padding in the seat, and that works out fine.The only thing I really regret is the lack of leg support for the lower leg; after a half-hour or so my calves really start to feel the strain and ache."
3,"Cute, but sort of dorky","This is good for people with ""Short Attention Span"" disorders. But, I'm probably missing the point. That's probably what it's for. I can't quite dis the quotes and don't want to, but it's frothy, kids. And yet, maybe frothy, light and somewhat easy reader-ish is what you desire. After all, they can't all be heavy handed recovery books. You read a bunch of those and you need a drink all over again! So buy it used, that's what I did, it's cheaper that way."
2,sleeper,"Unlike the previous editions in the series, Friction 6 is flat. Yeah, there's a few can't-miss writers in it like R.J. March, T. Hitman and Dale Chase, all come through as usual, but over all the book left me bored. I found myself having to move on to the next story in order to get the job done! That never happened in the previous volumes. Oh well, maybe 7 will be better."
4,Perfect for what I needed,"I bought this tool because the fins on my A/C were completely bent and mangled. It was starting to affect the performance of my unit. I was quoted several hundred dollars to get this fixed by a professional. Instead, I picked up this tool. It does support several different units since it has heads for different numbers of fins per inch. I was able to use this tool and spend about 30 minutes to fix the fins on my unit.I am rating this only four stars because this is not the best quality. For only a few uses it is wonderful, but a professional would never want to use this tool because I couldn't imagine it lasting with that much abuse."
1,No help,"The fins on this little tool don't fit with any of the fins on either my window air conditioner or the central air conditioner, which got damaged during a recent hail storm, so I'm back to square one. I found success by using a razor knife, which is a tedious process, though. I'd return it but after the postage my refund wouldn't make it worth it, so I'll just put it with all the other tools I have have no use for. It doesn't come with instructions, which was disappointing even if it's supposed to be obvious what a guy's supposed to do."
1,Defective piece of plastic junk,One of the tines on the '15' side is bent making it nearly impossible to insert into the radiator grill.
2,be aware,"Great price, and made with quality red handle.....The white plastic comb is not made to specs. the comb teeth are spaced right but the comb teeth are too wide, you will have to use sandpaper to make this product work. I also had three of the six combs with another problem. The teeth of these combs were either bent too far outward or inward, and there was no way to correct the problem. I think it is a great design, but maybe if it was made with a better process and too more ridged specs it could be worth the money and the time. If you need an item like this, keep searching for a better made product."
4,Worked For Me!,"I have a whirlpool window unit that is about five years old. This worked just great for it. I need to try it on my other unit now, but I was impressed with the simplicity. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the plastic tines look they won't have much longevity. Very happy with this purchase."
4,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately, this would not straighten out the fins on my A/C unit. I just couldn't get any section to fit. Well built and nicely priced if you can get it to work."
3,Didn't work for mine,"Didn't work for mine, I have a Frigidaire FAA055P7A which seems quite the popular AC to buy here on Amazon. I did follow one of the previous reviewers tip and measured the fins with a ruler before purchasing, mine had about 12 per one inch so I figured it would work on my AC. It didn't."
2,"It works, just not for long.","This tool WORKS, but you might want to buy 3 or 4 of them since the plastic teeth break after a few pulls through the fins. I had to resort to dragging the tool sideways across the bent fins to straighten them after a few of the teeth broke. A tool like this with either high-impact plastic or metal teeth would work much better.If it helps, I have a Coleman-Evcon heat pump/AC unit and the 14 count teeth worked well on my fins, until they broke of course."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book before my first trip to Austria. I had asinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly apastiche of unusable generalizations. That turned out to betrue. What shall we do with a paragraph that tells us thatAustrian women are strong-minded and independent andorganize their homelife well, although many go to work?This book might have some value for a person who had neverleft their english-speaking homeland before and needed tobe warned that people are sometimes naked in the saunaor at the beach. It also provides some amusing anecdotesabout language (especially viennese) and useful info aboutfestivals.Mostly, though this book was good for reading aloud toAustrian friends. I would quote it as an iron-cladauthority when their behavior didn't quite match thebook's version and thereby amused them tremendously.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN9781601640005"
1,Comes up with CRV3 and it's not....,The product is probably fine but it annoys me when I don't pay attention and I order it because it came up with a CRV3 search and it's not.
1,Shipping = price gouging. Product = okay,"These camera batteries seem okay. However, this company severerly overcharges for shipping. The batteries hold a charge and I even bought the crappy charger that goes with them -both items feature the worst build quality I've seen in electronics products. That being said, after two months I haven't been dissappointed by their service. I can't say enough bad about the way this company gouges you for shipping."
1,Dont Buy,"Please, Please....DONT BUYThis product is shipped by Thermemstore. They claim the Company name ""LENMAR"" but they shipped me wrong company's battery. They cheated with me. I will never recommend to buy this product. It is not possible, but i would have preffered to give this product a quarter star."
3,Is this the correct picture of the battery offered? Unsure.,"The battery needed for my Kodak Z812is has two round bare tips on one end. The battery pictured is quite different. The reviews mostly looked good, but I will not order this one unless I am sure it is the right one."
1,Don't buy this,This product is a gimmick that does not meet Sony specs and is VERY cumbersome to use. I was about ready to report this to the BBB.
1,didn't last,I bought these batteries when I bought my new camera. After the first charge they worked about two weeks (which is great after using regular AA batteries). Once they ran down though I have not been able to get them to re-charge. So I only got about two weeks use out of them. I don't know if it is the batteries or the charger. I am very dissapointed!!
2,Kodak KLIC 8000 Equivalent Li-ion Battery,"This did fit the camera, however it didn't last very long. It lasted for about 100 pictures and 2 20-30 second videos."
5,A very good read.,Cecielia Holland comes through again. With so many so-so books out there it is nice to have someone who always writes something I hate to put down.
3,A book more suited for Revising VB Basics,"Visual Basic for dummies is more suited for revision of VB Basics. This was the first VB Book I bought and frankly, I could not make much out of it. The book did not show us how to apply the concepts to real world applications and as a result, I bought a Step by Step VB Book from Microsoft and this book was much better. However, I stopped programming in VB for some time and I needed to refresh the basics before going on to more advanced topics. This is where I recommend Visual Basic for dummies. Its short code and explanations effectively refreshes my mind. I will recommend this book for people who have mastered the basics and just want to revise the basics of VB again. For true novices, I recommend getting VB Step by Step from Microsoft Press."
2,Solid for Start,"For real programmers and serious VB developers, this is definetely far from being enough. However, for begginers in VB this is useful guide. The only thing I mind is that there is a focus on GUI rather than code itself but that is what this book teaches you--just basic understanding. I wouldn't be able to write serious program for my company by reading only this book. If you have experience with programming get higher level book and you will be able to pick it up. I suggest VB and VBA from O'Reilly or Garry Cornell's VB 6 from Ground Up..."
2,Not so hot,"I generally like Dummies books, but this one is a little weak. The book covers a lot of topics but is really short on examples. I went through 90% of it and still didn't feel like I could actually write a meaningfull program. I purchased ""Microsoft Visiual Basic 6.0 Professional step by step"" by Michael Halvorson and found it to be MUCH better. I'm about 50% of the way through it and have learned a lot more."
4,Good but not,"I found this book GREAT for learning visual basic if you are an ABSOLUTE beginner. Which I am, or thanks to this book, was. If you want a book on learning VB6 without having to slave at it, this is great. The tutorials and the practice software on the CD was also great. Although two things went wrong and only 2: 1) When they start to talk about Class Modules, The last chapter and second to last chapter (12 and 13) should be in the total reverse order. 12 talks about the complications of Class Modules and 13 talks about the simple stuff. 2) This uses code statments that can be used 2 different ways. IE: They talk about ""End"" and ""Unload Me"", even though Microsoft never mentions the ""Unloade ME"" statment because Microsoft never uses it! But, all and all, this is a great book. If you are starting VB right as you are reading this, VB for Dummies if for you."
4,First Visual Basic book,"When I was trying to make the upgrade from Visual Basic 4.0 to Visual Basic 6.0, this was the first book that I bought. This book is very easy to read and there are ample examples to illustrate each principle that the author is trying to teach you. I combined this books with the 4 ""Learn to Program Visual Basic"" books by John Smiley to give me a solid foundation in Visual Basic 6.0. The cartoons in this book will reduce down the stress of trying to learn something new.Now that I am moving into .Net technology, I really appreciate how good this book was for people who have little or no experience with Visual Basic. This should be your first Visual Basic 6 book. By the way, Visual Basic 6 and the legacy source code that goes with it will be around for years to come."
3,For Dummies,"I was somewhat surprised about some of the reviews saying that is was too elementary; the title says VB for DUMMIES! I thought the book was a good starting book, but wished there were more coding involved especially in the later chapters. I was also a little put off by some of the examples that seemed a little unprofessional (refer to page 107 and 118 for examples) But overall it was a good book for the beginner."
2,"Replace the lousy jokes with explanations, please","If the lousy jokes were replaced with theory and explanations, this book would have been great! The book fails to explain more difficult topics in a good matter. The chapters describing Classes and Databases should have been left out or rewritten. Actually, these topics are not very difficult, but the reader makes them difficult by comparing it to dishwashers and cars, and by telling dreadfully bad jokes. Jokes are OK, but I rather read 200 pages of good explanations than 400 pages where 200 of them are rubbish."
1,NOT for BEGINNERS,This book is NOT for beginners. All it has is a whole lot of code and no real world examples of how it is used. The book also has about 1/2 of the content about designing a user interface but that is the least important. It is easy to get stuck with this book and there are better books available that really for beiginners and teach concepts of Visual Basic much better. It is an OK book if you just want to memorize lines of code.
2,mediocre book don't buy it until you have VB 6.0 installed,"The book is below average as far as instruction andlay-out. Worst of all you still need to shell out for the EDUCATIONALVERSION of VB 6.0. SAVE YOUR MONEY -skip this one and get a book, atthe local community college."
4,Shell collectors will appreciate,"Beautiful photography is enhanced by scientific and common names, plus descriptions of locations and depths for the mollusks. Includes bibliography (note: 1985!) and glossary, plus a sizing scale on back fly."
5,Nice Tray,"I have ordered many pieces from the Melissa line so far as I really like the pattern. As for the tidbit tray, it is much bigger than you might think from the picture (and the price), but it is made of plastic (melamine) which if I remember correctly, is not mentioned in the description. I would have to say, for the price, especially if you get free shipping, this is definitely worth purchasing."
2,Reading this book is a chore and awfully boring.,"This book was not well written and was boring. It did give you a greater appreciation for what her sisters do, but after a long while of senseless reading. The book is mostly other people's thoughts on her subjects and not her own. This book became very very dull, very very fast."
5,The Faith of a Remarkable Woman,"There truly is beauty in simplicity. This book provides a wonderful insight into the life and faith of Mother Teresa. Included are great examples of her remarkable compassion and concern for the poor, and stories from Missionaries of Charity volunteers about her day to day life.Most importantly, the book expounds upon the philosophy of Mother Teresa - written on a plaque in the Missionaries of Charity house, ""The fruit of silence is PRAYER. The fruit of prayer is FAITH. The fruit of faith is LOVE. The fruit of love is SERVICE. The fruit of service is PEACE.""I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to understand more about this remarkable woman."
5,Easy read and emplors a person,"Geared toward milti fath, this books puts you inside the mission of Mother Teresa and her helpers. It offers a new look into life and death. Some books are mentioned to further your study. Increases your self knowledge and desire to be a better Christian with more understanding of life. Many times I found myself reading sections over because they were so powerful. I bought this after getting it from the library so I can have it at home and share it with others."
5,Medieval Art VHS tape,"I purchased this video tape to use in my classroom to teach some medieval art as a follow-up to a Medieval Latin unit in Latin class. My 11th and 12th graders learned quite a bit about the art.We had studied St. Pius (Enea Silvio Piccolomini), for example. So, we discussed the art in the Duomo in Siena, where the illuminated manuscripts are located. We also discussed Petrarch, St. Jerome, Venerable Bede, and other Roman authors so the mention of some of them in the video was supportive.If you are teaching a beginning Latin class, it's not for you. If you are focusing instruction like this for juniors and seniors in an upper level Latin class, teaching Renaissance art, or taking a class in Western Civilization, get the video."
4,Hound Dog is a scream!,"I purchased this CD out of curiosity and man ....I was not disappointed. Her version had me on the floor laughing. My favorite part is during the guitar solo she says ""Now wag your tail""... It is a scream...."
4,Apples & Oranges,Why all the knockin' Elvis's version?? It sold millions and put the song on the rock & roll map. He was..is.. one of the great singers of all time.Comparing Mama's version to Elvis's is like apples & oranges.Mama is.. well.. great! You like her or you don't. She's got that early old time rock sound that we grew up on. Listen to her music and make up your own mind... she is one 'rockin' Mama.
2,Save your money!,Big Mama Thornton is a blues singer who could rock a little.You'll genuinely find a lot more excitement and energy and soul (andhits) in the recordings of Ruth Brown and Laverne Baker. Please check those two artists out first before declaring this tepid blues to be some kind of feminist holy grail of 50s rock and roll. You won't be disappointed.
2,Not very funny.,"I watched this special on HBO, I laughed a few times, and he seems like a pretty likable guy, but his material isn't funny enough.I found myself sitting in my chair, really wanting to like this guy, but I didn't even chuckle for most of this special.Overall... pretty lame."
5,"Accurate translation, useful to students of Beowulf","This is a fluent and interesting translation in its own right, and a very useful companion for those attempting to read Beowulf in Old English--Liuzza follows the original rather closely, and has made sense of the often tangled syntax. His language is clear and straightforward--Seamus Heany's version is perhaps more beautiful, but much further from the OE text."
4,Works but..,"The unit arrived slightly damaged from shipping. The product should have been better boxed. Only the paint was scratched, but new is new. After assembly the rubber foot on the base is not designed correctly. (2) bolt hole pattern in the foot bracket is fine but the frame is not drilled to fit it. Funny, Briggs only sent one bolt to mount it. Amazon advertises set up for their $49 delivery fee. This was never offered by the delivering van lines."
4,Great generator,"I purchased this from Amazon and it was shipped by ABF Freight. It arrived in great shape and I had no shipping/delivery problems. It starts very easily no the first tug. It is NO louder than you would expect from an 11HP OHV engine. I found the sound level to be very tolerable, but it does not have the advanced muffler you'd find in a $1000+ Honda Generator. Just make a note to use synthetic 5W-30 oil as recommended in the manual if you live in cold climates, NOT the 30W they put include in the box, as the 30W won't flow (too thick) in cold climates and could damage the engine. The engine manual makes this point, but it needs to be made more prominent prior to setting up the unit."
3,LOUD - NOISY Generator,The unit itself looks great. The removable gas tank is nice. Very loud...don't believe the literature. I called B&S...they wouldn't even give me the Decibel rating of the engine. I bought this unit at Home Depot and will be returning it shortly.
3,"Good generator, BUT...","This is a good generator, but I should have spent a little more money to buy one that is quieter. These generators are good for construction sites, but not for a residential neighborhood. Very noisy!!!"
5,Owned 5 Years - Still running great,"I bought the old generac version of this 5 years ago and have been using it off and on for that time, including 14 days of 24hour use last year when we had a major wind storm. I ran all major appliances, heat and lights for that time (except for Stove). Unit runs like a champ and has about 500 hours on it now. Needed to replace the original battery this week as the electric start was not working, but other than that super happy.We put it in a small rubermaid outside storage crate, and run it in that to dampen the sound and protect it from rain etc. That works well and would recoment other to do the same (so will your neighbors shivering in the dark)"
5,Good Product,"$499 was the best price I found anywhere with free delivery. Works as promised. Easy assembly, started on the first pull."
3,Its very heavy for a little one!,"I liked this one, but my kid finds it very heavy and the phone handle is very heavy and annoying as it fall out often while pulling the toy.Not a great toy"
3,Great toy but its not a phone,"The toy has nice features that teach the concepts of numbers, animal sound recognition, hand eye coordination, plus fun tunes that my 12 months old daughter loves to dance to. However the cord that is attached to the receiver of the phone is too short for my daughter to actually pick it up and use it as a phone receiver. The on/off button is located at a bad spot that makes unintentional turning ""on and off"" of the toy in the middle of the play session a frequent occurrence. The weight distribution makes it a poor pull toy that topples easily. I like this as a musical toy, but would purchase another toy phone in the future for my daughter to do imaginary phone plays."
3,Pretend Telephone,"The phone is cute, but the cord is really short so if you have a toddler that is older it isn't as fun to play with. It should have a more elastic/stretchy cord so that any size toddler could conform to it. Best for a child under 2."
3,Probably lots of fun...,"I think this toy would be lots of fun for a bit younger child (my boy is 2 and into cars). Plus, we must have thrown away the string because you can't pull it around. He'll play with it for a minute or two, but then moves along. Definitely not his favorite toy."
1,INCORRECT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,I ALSO ORDERED 2 OF THESE CAMERAS EXPECTING A 38 TO 125 ZOOM AND WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND FOUND THEY HAD ONLY A 30 TO 70 ZOOM. THEY ARE BEING RETURNED. IT'S A SHAME I ORDERED THEM BEFORE THE LAST REVIEWER LEFT HER COMMENTS.
1,Shuttered view!,"I needed the camera and RUSHED the order because I was going away. It doesn't come with a battery, so I had to buy one.The camera had rubber buttons and when you pushed them they stayed in.The worse part..the shutter would not open all the way.Now,I have to send it back and buy another camera but it won't be a Vivitar!!!"
1,Dissatisfied Customer,"I have had a terrible experience with this product. I purchased a new battery after receiving the camera. Early into my second roll of 24 exposure film, I had to replace the battery. The second battery was dead by the time I completed shooting the second roll of film.I returned the camera to the manufacturer, and waited about six weeks for it to be ""repaired or replaced."" In the meantime, I had no camera to take Christmas photos with. After taking only 10 pictures with the camera, it stopped advancing the film.I wish I had never purchased the product! I want nothing further to do with products by this manufacturer after this frustrating experience."
1,Incorrect Information,"I just got this camera in the mail last week. I was lured in by the affordable price and wonderful mode options.I'm a little bit disappointed in what I got.The zoom information turned out to be incorrect.The battery that was suppossed to be included wasn't.The mode buttons are tiny and are getting stuck when used.The automatic mode does not turn the flash on.I had major problems with the auto focus option, basically it was trying to focus and couldn't, causing me to wait for a really long time before I could really take a picture."
1,Vivitar Cameras,"I purchased a Vivitar PZ3560DB. I can't even find any information on the internet. I took the pictures to be developed and the only thing that came up was the date. So I tried to find a website to troubleshoot my problem. Nothing. From some of the comments, it doesn't seem like they can make a decent camera."
5,Great artwork and witty writing,"Always enjoyed watching this with my daughter on TV and to finally getit on dvd is a major plus, highly recommended!G2"
4,No Subtitles on DVD,I can't disagree with the sentiment of the other reviewers. My daughters love the show. The animation is good and the stories seem fun and Jane is a pretty good role model for girls.One thing that needs to be more obviously noted: This DVD release is not Subtitled. If you need subtitles you will be sorely disappointed.
3,Fairly cool,"I like the anti-skip.MP3 support is what I was after.It works OK, but skips now and then while decoding MP3.I like the display showing title and artist, if listed.I expected better MP3 decoding......."
2,ehh.,"it was ok.I have had this for a while now and have concluded that this is fine for sitting on a desk or sitting on the dash board of a car (with good shocks on a paved road; at ten mph or less).But anything else will just kill it. I am very careful with my electronics and the top half fell off in about 10 trips to school. And the interface, along with the Mp3 option didn't seem to work very well. but it's o.k I don't sugget this if you actually like to listen to music"
2,Skips way too much,"I bought this about half a year back, and have found that it skips a little too much when playing MP3s. Sometimes I can't even listen to songs because it is always skipping. As far as playing normal CD's it seems to handle it well."
4,Battery??,"I have a problem with this cd player. The problem its that my cd player ""burns"" battery literally. I put a pair of ""AA"" battery and in a half of hour it appears ""Low Battery"". Why???, and also I was searching for how much time does the battery offers and I couldn't find anything..."
5,Jensen Personal CD/MP3 Player,"I'M A MOBILE DJ AND USED TO LUG AROUND CASES OF CD'S. ALSOSEARCHING THRU ALL THOSE CD'S FOR SONGS WAS ALSO A HASSLE.THIS PERSONAL PLAYER IS EXCELLANT! THE ANTI SKIP WORKS SUPERB,AND YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE.EASY TO FIND SONGS, AND NOW I ONLY TAKE A ONE 30 CD WALLET WITH ME!"
5,Either you get it or you don't.,"There's not much middle ground with Jim's Journal. You will love this book, or you will think it is the dumbest thing you ever read. In my opinion, Jim's Journal is probably one of the funniest cartoons of all time. I own all of his first five books and don't regret buying a single one of them."
1,Quite unspectacular,"Dry diagrams and commentary, typical army instruction film. Interesting to historians, not to me."
5,"Good quality, and fun","Bought this for my two year old. He isn't really ready for the game, but we put 1/3 of the cards out face-down, and he turns them over and makes the matches. Terrific quality, clear and simple pictures, will be better and more useful as he grows. Great item."
2,WEAK PROLONGED LAME ENDING,"This writer is hit and miss. She can be quite good at times. This story is basically a novella stretched and bloated to novel length. At times downright dull, there's no one to remotely empathize with or care about the fate of. It's a safe bet the author doesn't rate humankind very highly and that's pretty understandable. But a writer should provide readers with an engaging tale with at least a couple of interesting characters. There's none of that here. And she's often very weak on her endings. That's the case here. Not recommended."
5,NATURE WITH A VENGENCE!,"I'm not a great lover of nature poems, I admit it--BUT the fish poems in this book are so creepy and wonderful and SCARY, that I was looking up ""pike"" facts on the web as soon as I finished these daring hardedged wild poems. David Dodd Lee's work spans violence from the deep lakes of Michigan to the Oklahoma City Bombing. I loved this book for how far it pushes the limits of ""polite"" poetry."
5,David J is a God,"I am very biased when it comes to David J. I have been a fan of his for 20 years. This may be his best solo effort. He seems to be able to capture the allure and pitfalls of fame and success perfectly. David's solo work is very different from Love and Rockets and Bauhaus. While Peter and Daniel seem to stick with that same style and feel, David J moves in and around it and often surprises you with his direction. If you haven't listened to David's solo work, buy this album first."
4,Great beginning arcade game for little guys!,My 5 year old has had this game since he was 3 and still plays it. I don't know how much he's really learned from it but he does really enjoy playing it over and over again. Nice also to see a superhero themed game with absolutely ZERO violence in it.
3,Meandering Yet Pleasant,"This is a nice coming-of-age tale of two attractive identical twins who attend their freshman year of university. They fall for boys, are gawked at by hordes of other boys, and the eventually make it through.There is a sadness that permeates the book, so that an overall cute and idyllic experience is tempered with a Knowles-ish realism. This is not a deep story, and the plot just sort of wanders into a mostly happy ending. A nice read, but nothing essential."
2,Oh Dear,"I hate to dampen the enthusiasm surrounding the debut novel of a fellow UCG head but I will.I was in UCG the same time as Julian Gough and appreciated his creativity. In first year it was an art exhibition after that it was Toasted Heretic which I sometimes feel was the John Hughes sound track to our particular bratpack movie.So when I saw this novel on a recent trip to Galway I scooped it up and eagerly began to read - leading to, disappointment.The Galway experience is beautifully described down to the sometime boredom of small city existence. The cultural references flow seamlessly throughout. BUT Julian Gough cannot write in the character of a woman - small but irritating lapses of feminine fact made this book so annoying I couldn't finish it - where was the fact checker, the copy editor - were they all male and don't realize how women perform some basic functions?"
3,"Charming, but...","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started this book, but it wasn't what I got. Julien Gough's story of twin girls in their first year at University in Galway has a witty sassy narrator in sister Juliet, but I kept waiting for something to happen. The book balances on the idea of the drama of everyday life, with the pursuit of love being at the forefront. The inside dust jacket likens it to a modern day Jane Austin novel, and that's not far off the mark. A modern day romance. A literate confection with a funny smart protagonist, a handsome tightly wound professor, and an insidious menace that never really feels that menacing. For me the book is well written and an enjoyable read, just not one that plot wise has a whole lot going on."
1,I'm baffled by the positive press this book has received.,"I read about 60 books a year and this is one of the most disappointing books I've read in a long time and certainly the weakest of this year's crop. The absence of any character development was one of the many weaknesses in the book. I didn't care what happened to Juno and Juliet. The character involved in the tragic ending was so poorly developed that I didn't experience any feelings for him. Likewise, the treatment towards this character at the time of the tragedy by the other characters in the book was cold and heartless, no doubt a result of the two-dimensional nature of their personalities. Quite a ... performance. This author has some maturing to do."
4,LIquid paraffin,This was exactly what I needed for the winebottle wicks I bought on vacation. It looks great in that Chianti bottle from Italy.
3,OK if you want to get some history on Graham,"This is a good book of essays by Graham. If you just want some enjoyable reading, then the book is OK. On the other hand if you really want to find out about Graham's Value Investing tatics the I would suggest his Intellegent Investor. That should give you enough to make a dent."
2,Not what I paid for,"I bought this book thinking I was learning about investing, this is a book about Benjamin Grahams life and briefly covers points about his philosophy on value investing. I do like reading about his life and the sections are broken up reasonably well. Nonetheless I was trying to learn about investing, not Janet Lowes opinion on Ben's sex life"
2,Title is not descriptive of the book,"If you think you're going to get an overview of Ben Graham's value investing ideas, then you should be looking elsewhere. This book is more of a biography, with a little bit of value investing thrown in. If you're interested in the life of Ben Graham (where he grew up, how he started his business, how he met David Dodd and Warren Buffett, how many wives he had, including his own son's lover, etc.), then this is the book for you.I would not read this book again. There's nothing of any value in here."
3,Mentor of giants.,"For me, billionaires are intriguing. For reasons I can't explain, I always seem to identify with their perspective on life and sifting through the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people always provides me with an interesting investigation into the minds of the compulsively successful. Warren Buffet certainly falls into that category. While reading about Warren Buffet I came across the name Benjamin Graham. Low and behold discovering Graham, further uncovered Buffet. While the famous students of Graham have displayed their own unique brands of brilliance, there is no denying Graham's obvious influence on their methods. Graham seemed to be more of a numbers artist, than a mathematical genius. His love of fair play and honesty created a group of level headed investment strategist that have set the tone for decency for decades. While this is not Pulitzer Prize winning stuff, it is an intriguing retrospective about an artist disguised as a genius and who he inspired."
4,"Murder, Love, and a Few Laughs","The Princess Comes Across is a who-dunit on a boat headed toward America. A journalist, an average dame disguised as a Swedish princess, and a group of detectives sail together not knowing their paths will cross, but when blackmail and murder occur, they're all linked together.This film is advertised as a comedy, but it is more of a romantic drama than anything else. There are times of wit, but the mystery of the murder and figuring out which characters are innocent and which are guilty is more dominant. There is also a decent love story between the reporter (Fred MacMurray) and the princess (Carole Lombard).These two leading actors are good in this film, but not great. MacMurray outshines the accented Lombard who has always been slightly overrated as a comedienne, in my eyes. She is certainly beautiful and the two make a handsome couple and a fun film."
3,"""She started yellin' for her Mamma and then ran out!""","""The Princess Comes Across"" is definitely in the second tier of Lombard films, but well-made and worth renting for fans.Lombard stars as ordinary showgirl Wanda, aka ""Princess Olga"". With a fake Swedish accent (which Lombard pulls off very nicely) and a friend and fellow thespian posing as a lady-in-waiting, Wanda gets a free crossing on an ocean liner and a film contract waiting for her in Hollywood. Unfortunately, a body turns up in her stateroom and the ruse becomes dangerous, especially when bandleader and concertina-fancier Fred McMurray gets involved.It's all pretty silly, but harmless enough with a few snappy lines and a host of character actors brightening the mix. McMurray and Lombard don't have much chemistry, but the costumes are glamorous and we do get to hear Fred sing. Pretty much a renter, but enjoyable.GRADE: B-"
3,rubbery egg white,"microwaves cook from the outside to the inside, but fast.I tried cooking at full power and found the egg white rubbery.I then tried cooking at 6/10 power, and the white was less rubbery, but the yolk was more runny.Maybe there's no way to avoid rubbery white with cooked yolk, or runny yolk with non-rubbery white.Scrambled maybe?"
2,Looks cute but works poorly,"Sadly, I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. The micro egg cup is a great idea that just doesn't work very well. I have tried the other reviewers' suggestions---poking the yolk with a toothpick, experimenting with the timing, etc.---but to no avail. The results are chronically inconsistent. Eggs from the same carton, cooked for the same amount of time, come out differently. The egg invariably gets hard boiled or overcooked on the top, but there's still raw white on the bottom. The best solution seems to be to cook an egg for a little while, scrape off the cooked top, and then put the raw part back in for 10 seconds or so until it's cooked, as well.I haven't had any staining, but the egg white does stick to the container more than I'd like, making it a bit of a pain to wash. For some reason I can't return it either. A disappointing product, and now I'm stuck with it."
5,I am so pleased with this item!,"I am a widow and am alone and didn't very often eat eggs. I have almost gone through a whole dozen since I have this item. In fact, I will have one for lunch this noon. I would always buy eggs and didn't make them, but always had them in case I needed them. My little egg maker has solved that problem. Thanks!"
4,Microwave egg cup,Works as promised. I could never make soft-boiled eggs that were not too runny or too hard. This works great.
1,egg exploded twice following their directions,Wanted to make soft boiled eggs. Followed instructions included to a T. Eggs exploded all over my microwave twice. Definitely not recommended.
3,egg cup,I chose this rating because I don't know how this cup worked. I bought it and gave it as a gift.
1,Trolls,"I've noticed all the positive reviews are in poorly written English, and also contain ""suggestions"" on how to add sauces and spices using this egg cup, and that the responses to all the negative reviews are snarky, also poorly written, and all use similar names - all with a K in them somewhere. Very clever, marketing trolls.That being said, I have a similarly designed egg cup, by another mfr. Works fine, but it's not the holy grail."
5,Great little egg cooker for the office...,"My sister had bought this and I saw how quick and easy it was to make an egg in the microwave. The cooking time varies on your microwave, but I usually scramble one whole egg plus one egg white from another egg for about 35 to 50 seconds. You need to watch/listen to it or it could explode in your microwave even though it has a screw on top. I love it because it makes a fluffy egg I can quickly make, eat and clean up in the office kitchen without any oils. I wouldn't count on this to make a hard boiled egg, but I haven't tried. Overall, it is a great little invention and I would probably buy more than one...one to keep in the office, one to keep at home."
2,Egg don't taste very good,"After cooking, the egg doesn't taste very good. Is complicated to know how many seconds you need to use use."
2,not much here,"Sure, its only $6.. but its not much more than a plastic easter egg you put candy in.The main problem with the product is really not a problem of the product.. but eggs. I found that I could not consistently cook an egg to ANY desired level. Even using eggs from the same pack, I would get a totally hard cooked egg in 42 seconds one time.. yet another would still have clear uncooked white in the same amount of time. I bought this mainly for soft boiled eggs in in the micro.. but the results are random.Even with a microwave with a rotating plate, you get hot spots... to even it out, I find you have to stir the egg once or twice while cooking. which I can do in ANY bowl.. don't see the point in having a six-dollar plastic easter egg when any old bowl works as well..."
5,This egg cup changed my life!,"This product is very easy to use, once you adapt the timing for your own microwave and egg doneness preference. Now I can make soft-boiled eggs in the kitchenette at work, or even on vacation."
1,Microwave Egg Cup,I only tried it once. Tried to soft boil an egg by following directions. The result was a watery uncooked mistake. I need a microwave with finer cooking (1 second) units to fine tune the cooking this thing really requires. I hate to eat my mistakes. It makes a nice decoration.
1,cheesy,"There are no instructions with this....just a box with ""boil eggs in 30-60 sec"". Google found me more...ie. 'pierce yolk with toothpick before microwaving'. The only way to know if the egg is cooked is when the lid blows off...no matter what other posters have said (they must be related to distributor). The cup stained yellow on first use...can't remove. Is the plastic they use for this safe? Think Bisphenol A (BPA)....who knows...It is made in China. All in all a cheap, cheesy product I would not recommend to anyone."
2,disappointed,None of the songs are play longer than 1.5 minutes and most cut off with 30 seconds or so. Love the music just disappointed that there was no reference to this problem.
2,Incomplete,Many of the songs cut off in the middle. At first I thought it was my download but the time of song is the same on my media player as it is here on the album. Very disappointing. Great music just not complete songs.
2,Wouldn't recommend,"It worked, but not very well. I bought this to teach my grandaughter how to sew and in a year a two I was going to give it to her. But I had to send it back. The thread kept breaking and it was hard to thread. Also, it kept jamming up. It really wasn't a very good performing machine and very frustrating to use. No, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Sorry."

1,Horrible. avoid this pedal,"I am lucky enough to have tried this pedal used. i have been playing for over 20 years, and this is hands down one of the worst pedals i have ever tried.to start off, i had no issues with the actual performance of the pedal. everything worked just as it should.the sound on the other hand is horrible. the distortion itself is not that great. although, one benefit is you can mix in the wet and dry signal. the sub-octave is where this pedal craps out. the tracking just does not exist. i have a 5 string active bass and this pedal could not track the low string. the only place it seemed to track properly was above the 12th fret. this made it completely unusable.avoid this pedal. if you want a sub octave, stay away from the mxr too. check out the mark bass pedal."
2,Deja Vu,"Years ago a young Russell Morris released ""Retrospective"" produced by Molly Meldrum. This disc is a reprise of that album and I bought it only to compare the two. Retrospective was one of the most unusual cd's and on of my all-time favourites. This one goes into the bottom of the heap. All of which means diddly to American music lovers.CheersBoris"
5,NordicWare Cast Aluminum Holiday Tree Bundt Pan,"The cake came out beautifully. I was very careful to grease and flour every inch of the pan. I made a chocolate mint cake which was too rich. The next time I use it, I will make something a little less rich. Also, the pan is made in the USA. That is one of the reasons I bought it.NordicWare Cast Aluminum Holiday Tree Bundt Pan"
5,Always Funny - And That Doesn't Apply to Many People,"Two performances finally show up on DVD from a woman who invariably has funny stuff to say. It may not be wall-to-wall hilarious, but then most comics have one really funny performance to their names. Kathy Griffin is way better than that. I'd get any DVD she releases. And I'm not even one of her gays."
5,Mother of etymological Turkish dictionaries,The most comprehensive and scholarly work ever written on Turkish language etymology. One would have expected that certain Turkish scholars read this book before having published their etymological dictionaries on Turkish language.
3,Puzzle for who?,"This product does not come assembled, and piece together the panels can be very frustrating at times. If you have the time and patience to put together then this product is for you."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Don't waste your money on this ridiculous thing- it is impossible to put together, it crumbles at the slightest touch. If you ever saw Fraggle Rock in the 80s- I'd compare this thing to Doozer construction. Your money would be put to better use if you ga785 Hampton Creek Way, Columbia SC 29209 it directly to the hamster to shred for bedding."
1,Advertised as Metal...Arrived Plastic!!!,"I searched everywhere to find a metal frame at a good price. It seemed as if I had finally found it since it showed the retail price at almost $30, on sale for under $10...then it arrived. All plastic...I am sending this back in the morning and will update this review as my adventure unfolds..."
3,Decent map,Bought this for travel in NL. This is a decent map though lacking in topo detail. For a small area they could have put in more detail. I will not rely soley on this map but GPS topo and satellite imagery will fill in the gaps.
1,Horrible book,"I bought this book back when it was available for a reasonable price, but it was still a waste of money. The book really seemed to be just a bunch of random things thrown together. The majority of the ""links"" between the Zodiac and the Manson family were ridiculous. Things like one of the Manson follower's nicknames was the same as the name of the street one of the Zodiac killings happened on....come on, really? The few interesting things in this book were buried by too many of these laughable facts. I was really looking forward to reading this book but I was extremely disappointed. I felt like the whole time I was reading this book, I was shaking my head and rolling my eyes. If you can find this book cheap, you may want to check it out if you feel like digging through it. However, there is no way this book is worth the inflated price it is going for now."
5,Perfect,"I was given a framed picture ... didn't like the picture but loved the frame which had ""Give thanks to the Lord"" carved in it. I searched for a replacement picture to put in the frame. When I saw this I knew it was the perfect one. It arrived in just a few days and looks wonderful in the frame."
5,as advertised,"This product easily removes tar and other sticky things (tree sap, for one) from your vehicle's paint. My car is white so it was pretty obvious that it worked."
1,Waste,Hose from pump had 2 kinks in it. There is no straightening it out. It's not worth the money. I would not purchase again.
2,These are not natural cough drops,"Amazon's description of this product is misleading and potentially dangerous. If you look at their description, it says ""Ricola Natural Sugar Free..."". The product's label doesn't say this. This product contains Aspartame, which is not natural and can be dangerous to Phenylketonurics (those individuals who cannot properly process Phenylalanine)."
3,Kingdom Comedy,Rickey Smiley is funny as usual. Todd Lynn made me laugh out loud. The other comedians are not so funny.
3,Kingdom Comedy,Sometime this type of comedy is hard for me to understand. But what I did understand I enjoyed.
1,Just Horrible,This DVD is by far the worst presentation of Rickey Smiley's work. It is family friendly but it wasnt very funny.
1,This book is horrible!,"I have never seen a worse school memories book. Instead of storage pockets for mementos, the book comes with construction paper sheets for making paste-on collages. The binder is a standard 1"" version with a clear pocket on the front where the title page is inserted. I expected a professional looking product, but the book looks like someone pulled it together using a poor quality laser printer. The only saving grace is that the 3 ring binder feature allowed me to insert my own storage pockets for mementos, preventing the hassle and expense of having to return the book."
1,Totally disappointed!,"I thought this would be a perfect ""go as they grow"" notebook for my grandchildren's school days. It was stinky plain notebook with pages inside that all need to be redone due to misalignment and pitiful graphics. I was embarrassed to give it to my daughter."
5,Beyond music in other words,This soundtrack is way beyond music even....it's tones and percussion make you feel as if your on another world. A must-buy for any Alien or music fan. The first track sends shiver's down your spine.
2,"Very, very overrated","I am not much of an Elliot Goldenthal fan, but I do enjoy some of his scores--Heat, Michael Collins, Interview w/a Vampire, Frida, and Final Fantasy. But this score is horrifically overrated! The alien movies have never had really strong scores, but I think the first one (Jerry Goldsmith's) is probably the strongest of the four. The dark, portentous alien music that I had expected was merely noise, with no coherent themes at all. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. But all is not a total loss; the final track, ""Adagio"" is actually quite good. If all of the score had the thematic material and emotion that is in ""Adagio"", this CD would easily be 4 or 5 stars. But, alas, the rest of the CD is noise. So you must decide whether four minutes of good orchestral music is worth however much you pay for this CD."
1,Boring!,"People trying to artsy about their memories of Vespa's, it's a non-electric yawn machine...pass it by."
1,"Works for a while then, plunk","This item worked fine for a while, then it started erratically disconnecting and screwing up other devices connected to the USB bus. So far Belkin is batting 0/3 --- the failures of: 1) the F5U234 USB hub, 2) my Belkin 4-port ethernet router, which would black out under too much traffic, and 3) myBelkin MasterCube F9H120-CW 1-Outlet Wall-Mount Surge Protector, which short-circuited and blew the breaker at the hotel I was staying in. I will avoid Belkin and choose other brands in the future. I replaced Belkin F5U234 hub with aPlugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter)which I hope will work better. I replaced the Belkin ethernet router with an AppleAirport Extreme 802.11N (5TH GEN)and it works great."
2,I wish I bought the smaller Mini DV Cam instead,"I made a rash purchase wihtout all the facts, and now regret it. Now that I see the smaller MiniDV product, I prefer the smaller size instead. Plus there a several different companies producing MiniDV and only one producing Digital 8. Live and learn"
1,Another FORMER Sony customer...BLACK SCREEN of death,"I bought Sony camcorder last year. It has stopped recording video. I can't see anything in the viewfinder or screen. Absolutely nothing.On the flip side, it did work nicely for the year when it was working though.Just in case, you think I am disgruntled, cynical and I am writing this out of spite, please follow this link. There are many like us.http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7594-0.html?forumID=59&threadID;=53316&messageID;=635769In fact, people there have filed a class action suit against Sony on this issue.Overall, buy it if you want to. But see you on the forum above in 1 year."
1,burned on this purchase,"I ordered this camera because I already owned one which needed repair. I could not find anywhere that would repair it. I have many movies of cherished events from years past that I wanted to be able to edit for my children and grandchildren. Unfortunately, the camera that I ordered from Amazon does not work. It shows a code on the screen that means that it needs a new motor. Nice! Not!"
5,So Easy & So Sophisticated,"For a unit with advanced features,this unit is remarkably easy to use (even for the klutz in the family). It self adjusts and the many buttons for personalized adjustsments are right at your fingertips. It makes videotaping easy so you can focus on the object and enjoy the event you're taping. Ergonomic, Easy, Affordable Yet Jammed with Sophisticated Features."
1,Wrong Item,"I bought this item, thinking it was a laser pointer. I received it in the mail over a week ago, e-mailed the seller saying it was not what I wanted, and the person never e-mailed me back."
4,Different,"This cd has a real different sound to it, but it is really good. The song ""Wild Kentucky Skies"" is wicked awesome!"
4,made my very dull plastic look new,Works excellent but if you have faded out black plastic you will need to reapply it every week or two. I was surprised at how well it made it look
2,Restores and Runs,"I use mainly all Meguiar's products for the care of my family's two vehicles. This product works as advertised, which is to say that it restores the plastic, rubber and vinyl trim to black. But water causes this product to run like a woman's mascara and it leaves ugly streaks on my black 07 F-150. I know that having a black vehicle amplifies all imperfections, so it may not show on other vehicle colors. But its too much for me to ignore. It also can leave a greasy look if you dont wipe it again with a dry cloth. Its still greasy-feeling when you touch it, though. I am going to try Adam's SuperVRT."
1,Meguiars G10810 Gold Class Trim Detailer- 10oz,"Worthless and here's why...When it rains, its like you never used it. So unless you want to apply it EVERY time you wash your vehicle or it rains then there's absolutely no reason to use this product.I've tried it multiple times and will give it ago again, but that's how this stuff is. The last time, multiple coats didn't do anything extra.It looks nice after applied, although greasy so don't touch it.There's really not much more to say. Shoe polish or magic marker would probably work better."
2,goo,This Trim Detailer made the plastic on my Chevy Avalanche look new. That's the good. The Trim Detailer ran down the side of my truck and back glass with the first rain. I still haven't gotten it off my glass and it is difficult to get off my paint. That's the bad.
5,Very good product,"Short of spending $30 for a trim detailer, the Gold Class product works very well. Best of the consumer brands. If you buff it after it dries, it will keep the run off to a minimum. I used it on the lower trim on my 2010 Mustang, and it still looks good a month later. It DOES REMOVE wax."
2,An Uneven Book,"As a newcomer to Adobe PhotoShop, I had high hopes for this book. It is of some limited usefulness but ufortunately it is a very uneven book.As others have written, the overuse of grade-school level humor detracts somewhat from it. Far worse is the author's practice of glossing over some very basic concepts, such as how to resize an image without noticeable loss of resolution, how to begin work on a new photographic layer and how to ""flatten"" an image seamlessly. In these and other instances, explainations are sometimes convoluted but seldom clear. Some other techniques are explained well.This seems to be a book which was written for people who already know quite a bit about PhotoShop, or perhaps was written by a person who is not an especially good teacher.If there is no other book available, this one will offer some help with the program. But there are several other books on Adobe PhotoShop which offer the newcomer better and clearer instruction."
2,Too much keyboard shortcut information,"I didn't know anything about Photoshop before I bought this book. It is helping me to learn the basics, but I find the humor to be distracting. I'm also frustrated by the amount of information on shortcut keys early in the book. I'm sure I'll be grateful for the information some day, but not while I'm learning the product. It's too much."
1,PhotoShop for Dummies is just Dumb,"If the writer of this book concentrated more on providing helpful information rather than wasting my time attempting to be witty, this book might have been useful. I found this book to be a total waste of my time and money. It doesn't even warrant the 1 star rating minimum."
5,This book is awesome,"This book shows you all the shortcut keys that help you get around the program. The full-color pages show you what kind of effects PhotoShop is capable of, and the well-organized pages surrounding the color show you how to accomplish it. This book uncovers all the hidden wonders PhotoShop is capable of. If you paid $600+ for PhotoShop 5 then you need to pay the extra money to get a copy of this book. No matter what the cost."
3,The book is okay.,"I found the book to be informative, yet missing something. After reading the book I still have a lot of questions. I think it takes two reading of the book to fully understand Photoshop 5, and that's one to many in my book!"
4,Truth stranger than fiction,"Right after reading Ali and Nino I had to find out more about the author. A short and very bizarre life indeed! I learned more about the Russian revolution and Germany's descent into facism from reading this book than in any high school or college class. At times, too much detail to absorb that detracts from the story."
1,Fugetaboutit!,"Lots of interesting lore, lots of speculations about the crisis of the modern world, but actually very little about Lev Nussimbaum, the so-called Orientatlist. How did he get his knowledge, considering how marginal his education was? What did his books really offer the reader, since very few have ever had the opportunity to read him? Why did he stay in Fascist Europe? Why did he die at 35 or 36 and look in a contemporary photo like a man of seventy? There is much here that is not answered. There is no discussion of what value Orientalism has. I suspect that the author has simply gotten carried away with eccentricities without ever having determined what value all this material may have.When Leon Trotsky allegedly asked his son, ""who is Essad Bey (aka Lev Nussimbaum)"" what is this supposed to signify? Perhaps if Nussimbaum had asked his father ""who is Leon Trotsky"" we would have learned something of value."
4,mainly a history book,"I was a bit dissapointed in this book. I had read Ali and Nino and, of course, the reviews for this book. I was prepared for adventure in the form of a historical novel. I wonder if the reviewers cited in the front and back of the book only read the introduction, which gives away the story, including the 'ending.' The rest of the book provides historical context to the story told in the introduction. There are relatively long (20-30 pages?) digressions on the history of (for example) the Ottoman Empire, German culture during the rise of the Nazis, etc. Very interesting and worthwhile stuff to be sure and I am very glad that I read this book. However, readers need to be prepared for this type of text. The read was quite a bit slower than I expected. The 'story' in my opinion, is much more interesting than the book itself. The 'story' here, includes the efforts of the author, which were certainly inspiring."
3,Unsolved mystery,"Tom Reiss delivers a lively, informative and colourful account of the extraordinary social upheavals of late 19th and early 20th century Europe. He uses Lev Nussimbaum as his vehicle to explore the region and the time. Unfortunately he succeeds in solving the central mystery - referenced in the title - only to a limited degree. Reiss does prodigious work to track the perigrinations of Nussimbaum and to trace his connections and work, but the man himself remains a cypher. There are few contemporaries who recorded much more than superficial observations or unsupported conclusions about Nussimbaum. And the man himself thrived on secrecy, revealing almost nothing of himself. His last testimony, notes created as Nussimbaum was dying, is conveyed in scribbled abstractions. One is left at the end of the book almost as curious as at the beginning about what really animated this curious life.But it's a fascinating account of pre-World War 2 Europe and a great read."
4,"Fascinating story, but too long","This story is unbelieveable, but for the extensive research that obviously backs it up. Lev Nussimbaum/Essad Bey/Kurban Said must have been a fascinating character and the many turns of his life make for a great story.My only complaint, and the reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it's simply too long. Most of the extra length is not Lev's story, but the extensive background that Reiss offers to set the stage for Lev's activities and life decisions. While some of the background gives necessary depth, in many places I found myself looking for where things get interesting again.One periodically sees the question ""who would you like to have dinner with, if you could pick anyone from the 20th century"". After reading this book, I'd pick any of the three personas as one of the most fascinating eyewitnesses to history, and a great storyteller to boot."
3,Had to put it down,"I gave up on page 230. The historical detail just got to be too much. Up until then, I really loved the history about parts of the world I knew little or nothing of (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Persia/Iran, Czarist Russia, the Ottoman empire, etc). Really good stuff. But when Lev got to Germany, the details became overwhelming. I don't have the time/energy to sift through it all. Maybe when I retire. I would have loved to see what Lev did next, but it seemed to become more about the writer's history chops than Lev."
2,Don't really care,"I read this book for my Book Club.I read The Orientalist last summer ('07) and now the book seems to fade into obscurity.I don't remember a whole lot, but I do remember not really coming to care a whole lot about Kurban Said.Very forgetable to me although there is a bit of history that is interesting."
1,The Orientalist,The book was chosen by our book club. Out of the ten members only one finished the book. We all found it tedious.
4,A bizarre biography,"This story is so strange as to seem unreal, but it is a fascinating picture of Eastern Europe and Jewish life between the two World Wars."
5,A wonderful history lesson,"I learned so much about the Caucasus, the early 20th century, the interwar period - a fascinating book, well-written, well-researched! So glad I had it on the Kindle so I could easily jump back and forth between the text and the footnotes, which provided additional details. This is the best way to study history!"
1,A real disappointment,I was expecting a lot more insight into the management challenges and practice of outsourcing from someone working for Accenture.The key message of the book that outsourcing should be seen as a transformation force is great in theory but extremely difficult to implement. The insight into how this is done in the political real-world workplace is missing. The case studies presented in this book left me with a view that the author was retrofitting the transformation story on various projects.
1,Don't buy this unit,"1. It has trouble reading CDs. Sometimes I have to try 3-4 times (loading and unloading the disk) before the unit will play.2. Vertical loading of CDs is bad design. You will inevitably, eventually scratch them getting them in and out of the unit.3. Radio reception is terrible, and there is no way to add a bigger antenna.4. I'm willing to bet the motorized door will break within a few months of use. Fewer moving parts = better design (just ask people with motorized minivan doors).5. Controls on a radio/CD player should be intuitive to anyone who's used a few of these devices. Since I had to read the directions on even the simplest things, I think the controls are poorly thought out.Just remember, you get what you pay for. This is a cheap unit, and it shows."
2,CD Player skips,"The cd player is ... ... the rest of it (size, price, radio, and other features) is great but the cd player skips if a cd has the slightest spec of dust on it."
5,Great radio with lots of features,"I just purchased one of these clock radios and really like it. You can put a cd in and wake to the track of the cd you want to hear, plus with the two separate alarms, you can set the second alarm to sound with a ramp up tone in case you wouldn't wake up to the music. Great sound for a compact system. Directions are easy to follow, just read them and program the buttons with ease. Plus it also comes with a nature cd with lots of different sounds such as birds and stream sounds. I am thinking of purchasing a second radio for my other room. It can also be programmed with the nap setting to wake you up after so many minutes, and a sleep setting to let you fall asleep to the radio or cd, then it will turn of after the time you set it. Just press a button and a motorized door opens up to insert cd then closes. Dimmer switch on the back to adjust the brightness of the display. Great little system."
1,Ghost radio,"I Bought this item for my son for christmas almost 2 yrs ago. After many nights of me complaining about his alarm going off at all hours of the night,and telling him to read the directions so he can set it correctly. I have found that there is a ghost in his unit. I have checked his alarm settings for both of the alarms and they appear to be ok. His alarm went off from 11:30pm until 1:30 am last night when we finally unplugged it. Now that I have done some research it appears we are not the only ones with the ghost in there unit.If you do not have a problem being up all night due to the alarm picking and choosing what time it wants to go off then this is the unit for you.I personally would not recommend this item to anyone. I doubt I will purchase any other RCA items as I should have learned from the last items purchased they are no good.A disappointed customer"
1,One big annoyance ruins it all.,"Initially, this system seems ideal. It has a great design and the alarm feature, while very difficult to learn how to use, works fine. The sound is actually even decent for the typical clock radio. There is one problem--that ever-present humming. Maybe it's just my ears, but whenever I play CDs, at low to moderate volumes, there seems to be this constant high-pitched whistle--I think it's from the CD spinning around. At any rate, I returned the clock pretty early on. I never tried another one, but if you buy this, keep a look out for that annoyance. It ruined the product for me."
1,RCA CD/Clock Radio,"I only gave this a one-star rating instead of a zero (based on design only). However, the quality control of the CD player is questionable. The first time we purchased this product, we had to exchange it because the CD player was not recognizing the disks. The disks in the one we own now skip and has a tracking problem."
5,It works as great as it looks.,"First of all, let's face it this is one cool looking alarm clock. It just plain looks cool. Okay that was redundant, but I've had one of these for a while and I know of what I speak.And unlike most things that look cool it works. Irregardless of what other reviews say, I've yet to find a CD that this doesn't not work with. It's reliable and, yes you have to read two pages of the manual before the controls make sense, but once you've done that you're good to go.Okay, for you self-explanatory-interface people, crack a manual, it won't kill you and once you know how it works it's like riding a bike.This is one conversation piece as effective as it is impressive."
2,Returning Mine Today,"I had no problem with the CD as others appear to have had but I've only had the unit for 5 days. My disappointment was with the sound and display. There was a background humming/warbling noise on both AM/FM at various times which would go away when the radio was switched off, then on again---so I knew it wasn't just poor reception. As for the display, I can barely even distinguish the numerals at night---for all intents and purposes it can't be read from a distance of over 18 inches so if you're putting it on a nightstand, think again. As far as I'm concerned, the best displays for any digital clock remain the illimunated red, green, blue, etc. LED's---NOT LCD's with backlit backgrounds."
1,Bad CD player,I have had two of these items. In both cases the CD player has failed to work properly after about 2 weeks of use. I got so frustrated with this clock radio that I just gave up on the thing. The AM/FM part of the unit is OK and I like the dual wake feature. That is why I choose to rate the unit with one star rather than none. I do not recommend that you buy this unit.
1,Don't make the mistake of buying this.,"From day one, there have been nothing but problems with this product. It skips on the higher tracks of every CD I have ever given it (including new ones), and the volume on the radio randomly goes quiet while playing. Purchase the Sony counterpart, not this."
2,Looks great but won't last,"I loved the CD player and the nature sounds CD - but it broke after only one month of use. The door mechanism would no longer close and because I thought I could fix it - I ended up destroying the mechanism, which is all made of plastic gears by the way. Too bad this good looking radio/CD is a piece of junk."
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this unit based on its looks and confidence in the RCA brand, but have come to think of it as among the biggest purchase disappointments of my life. In the first place, the sound quality is poor, with the sound seeming to struggle against some kind of underlying hum. And the radio station reception is crummy. But then, the CD playeer stopped working after maybe eight weeks -- it simply refuses to recognize you've put a disc into it. I still have the thing on my night stand, because the alarm clock function works fine, but I could have had an electric alarm clock for one-seventh the price. I would have bought another clock radio/CD by now, but I'm worried some other once-trustworthy brand is also putting its name on cheap junk."
1,Don't care for it,"This cd player is noisy and unreliable.It has a hard time reading cd's a lot, and because of that it skips tracks, or just keeps spinning the cd and doesn't play the song until you stop it and track up to the next song. While it's spinning or playing a cd, it makes all kinds of whirring or squeeking sounds, ESPECIALLY when it can't read a track... very noisy and irritating.I think it looks cool, and people comment on how neat it is, but honestly, that's all mine is good for. Maybe I got a lemon, but my cd player is awful."
1,RCA CD/Clock Radio,"The sound on this radio is terrible; it alternates between being too soft, yet somewhat clear to loud with electronic feedback of some kind. Last week, the CD player stopped reading disks, and the usual cd-player cleaning has not helped. I would recommend looking for another style or brand."
1,Absolute Junk,I have two units that have both quit working. Unfortunatley out of the return period I am just going to have to settle for throwing the darn things away. In both cases the CD player quit working. It is a rather expensive paper weight.
2,Don't buy,"This clock is hard to use, hard to shut off and lacks some of the great components of the similar sony dream machine. AND . . . the bright green display will wake you in the night when you roll over and face it. Ridiculous. I absolutely do not like the design, lay out, functionality of this clock. And I'm sure the door on the CD player will break eventually as it has a motorized component to it."
1,not as cool as it looks,"I was so excited about getting a new alarm clock with a cd player and was willing to spend some money. While checking out a bunch we though this was a pretty cool looking and it had all the features I was looking for. We did notice that because of the way it opens there might be problems in the future, so we got the extended insurance. What we didn't exect was the fact that it isn't balanced properly inside, so the cd taps. It definatly woke me up, but the tapping was so annoying it almost got thrown through the window. I'll be returning it today."
2,"It's cute, but it's so dumb","I've been looking everywhere for a decent alarm clock that will start beeping softly and increase volume over time. With the Graduwake feature, I thought my prayers were answered. It sounded good in the store, but at home I realized that it doesn't Graduwake me at all! It starts off really loud, and gets very slightly louder over time. Also, I have to sit up in bed and squint my eyes to read the clock at night. And the CD player just doesn't work sometimes. It whirs and whirs and can't find a track, and you have to press stop and restart it to get it to work. And if you press the nap button, there is no way to cancel it. We were happy with the sound quality though. We returned it today."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I have had two of these alarm clocks. Both of them broke after a couple of months. The first one lasted about a month, and then one morning, the alarm did not go off, causing me to be over an hour late to work. The cd just stopped working. When you hit play, it would try to spin, stop, and then the face plate would open. I returned it, and the second one broke in the same manner after two months. I returned it and bought a Sony!"
1,A Better Choice,"Based upon the other reviews, I would recommend RCA RP3750 Clock Radio. It has basically the same features, but not as cool looking. The CD has played perfectly, although I have had it only 5 days. No annoying hum! The door is purely mechanical, as in most cassette players, so should be no problem. The radio tunes stations without a problem. And I bought it at Big Lots for only $29.95!"
1,ANOTHER RCA JUNK UP,I thought I would give RCA another chance so I bought this clock radio and it only lasted for less then two weeks before it went to hell. Now that will be the last RCA product i'll ever own as this product became what RCA products becomes best...ANOTHER RCA JUNK UP!
1,Radio reception is poor,There is a distinct background hissing noise on even the clearest stations. My old analog radio gets the same stations clearly with no background noise.This is an attractive looking unit and has great alarm clock features but it is only useful as an alarm clock because of the the poor reception performance. There is no place to add an antenna.I regret that I'm returning the unit.
1,"Would rate ""NO"" star if I could...","My husband bought this for me about 2 yrs ago for my birthday so I could use at work. The radio worked fine but CD player from day one was a mess. Would play CD's for maybe 15 minutes then started 'acting up'. Hadn't used it in over a year til my son was born and recently tried using to play lullaby CD's. Like the previous reviewer mentioned, you can actually 'hear' the player straining to play the CD...then it actually 'skips' (sounds like), eventually stopping play altogether though the CD is still spinning. Funny, I just hopped on Amazon to look for a new clock radio/CD player and happened to see my exact current model listed!! I HAD NO IDEA MY HUBBY SPENT THIS MUCH!! $70?!?!? What a waste!"
4,Small and Intimate Touch - Great Photo Diary,"This is a collection of documentary photographs of Russia, which was taken by Magnum photographer Luc Delahaye, during 1998-1999. The warm and contrast colour make you feel like unreal on the scenario. It provides you with an insight into the life and living environment of ordinary people in the places. Some photos somehow look like a paintings. It is not a 'great' (in size) photographic book, but the 'diary' like size makes you get closer and have intimate touch with the subject and photographer's eye.Nice and intimate touch ..."
2,TICKET IN THE WRONG DIRECTION OR A TRIP WITH BLINDS ON?,"This book is not about art, and not about photojournalism. It is a reflection of the pain that a person, who photographed so many wars, and has seen so much deaths and drama has inside of him. I have spent a number of years myself in different war zones and know how hard it is to adopt to real life. Sad to see a talented photographer coming to Russia to do a book on drunks and junkies as if there is nothing else worth to notice in such a great land."
4,Some More Horse Tradin',This was an excellent book. I greatly enjoyed each and every adventure that Ben K. Green takes you through in the book. In a time where everything is done the easy way it is great to be able to look back and see how things realy used to be done. Through this book you are able to get a very clear picture of the old west. I loved reading about all the different ways the horse traders thought of to skam each other and somehow they both thought they were getting a good deal. I thought this book was great and was not able to put it down once I picked it up. I can't wait to read more by Ben K. Green.
5,Wonderful!,"I have purchased three of these for my kennel. They are absolutely wonderful. My Kennel is some what shaded by trees but the areas shaded by the ""Shady dog"" cover is still an easy ten degrees cooler than the rest of the kennel. I recommend this kennel cover, and will also be buying more as time passes."
4,Complete!,"Yes! The never before released Noah arc is included in its entirety!While the latter half of season three has been available on individual DVDs for some time, the first half, for reasons known only to 4-Kids/Funmation was never released. Until now.Although the Noah arc was not a part of the original manga, it is a major plotline in the anime, comprising numerous episodes, and it is referred to in spin-off videogames (Nightmare Troubadour for example) as well being referred back to in later episodes. Having it unavailable left a large hole in the storyline as it included a lot of the Kaibas' backstory. It is a pleasure to have it included in this collection."
5,YU GI OH GETS BETTER,THE THIRD SEASON IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SEASONS WITH SEASON 4.SEASON 1 WASNOT THAT GOOD. THE SECOND SEASON WAS BETTER. SEASON 5 GOT A LITTLE BITWORSE. I CANT WAIT TO GET THIS WHEN IT COMES OUT ON JULY 29 2008. GET ITPS. IT GOT REALLY GOOD REVIEWSPSS. IT HAS CYBERSPACE EPIODES AND THE ENTER THE SHADOW REALM EPISODESPSS. FORTYSEVEN EPISODES
1,???,"Really?! Like, really dude? Who in their right mind is paying this?! Get a clue please. No one will ever buy this... ever. If they do you shouldn't be allowed to take their money because obviously they are not of sound mind and body."
2,Not even uncut?,I understood if all the yugioh dvd sets where uncut and rated MA saddle these sets are still tv y-7. I mean who in the world would be stupid enough to purchase these edited yugioh dvd sets.
5,"If you want the truth, read this book!!","This book explains to the reader why they were murdered, how they were murdered, and who was responsible for these horrific crimes. The author, who lived in Russia for quite a few years before the Bolshevik Revolution and investigated the murders a year after they happened, is able to provide first hand information and facts about this terrible event. The book was originally published in London in 1920."
1,Anti-semitic and full of flaws,"The book is violently anti-Semitic. More importantly for an informed reader, it is so inaccurate that it is useless for anybody but historians exploring the investigation of Romanov murders. Wilton's hatred of Jews clouded his mind to the extent that he was unable to establish even the most basic facts concerning the case, although he had ample opportunity to interview a significant number of key witnesses and had access to evidence now lost. Wilton was fired from London's ""Times"" for being unreliable, in 1919 the British High Commission wanted him recalled and Foreign Office often branded him a liar and an embarrassment."
1,This is an anti-semitic book,"No, I'm not being overly sensitive. This book is anti-semitic and proud of it. It was originally published in 1920, written by a British correspondent who was involved in the initial investigation of the murders of the Romanovs and as such it has some interest. The edition offered here is published by the ""Institute for Historical Review"" which appears, from the introduction, to be one of the unfortunately not uncommon organizations dedicated to falsifiying history bydenying the holocaust, blaming t"
4,Opinion and observation,"Although this book is wonderful and a powerful testimony, it only depicts the past and not the present. Presently the Church in San Antonio is not the Christian place it should be. People are judged and there is a lack of forgiveness at this Church. There is a ministry in Austin where things are not right and ignored by Freddie and Ninfa. Although the book has facts and a great story. The fact remains that a new book needs to be written on what can happen if you lose sight of God."
5,You must read it to believe it,"Incredible and wonderfull, The power of God is all over this man and his ministry. This man is still alive and serving God. He is everything the book says he is. I have met him and his family and I have attended his church. God does exist."
4,A Great Resource!,"I am the President of Cohesion Inc, and also a part-time course director in the marketing faculty of the Schulich School of Business, York University in Toronto, Canada. Strategic organizational change management is central to our mission of building strong brands and businesses through transforming them into high performance marketing systems.Whether you are new to change management or already an experienced practitioner, this book will serve as a great resource given its easy to read style and numerous practical examples and tools."
5,Perfect Ingredient,"We were introduced to this soy sause from a friend in Bali. I was thrilled to find we could purchase it on the internet. Kecap Manis Sweet Soy Sause is the perfect addition to teriyake marinades for chicken, beef and fish. The thick sweetness brightens marinades and also adds a perfect thickner to glazes. I use this sause (as it is sweeter and thicker) to regular soy sause. I love the fact that it comes in big bottles, and through this venue is reasonably priced! Will be making another order soon! Wonderful over steamed rice ~Barb in California"
2,Not as advertised,"The product arrived promptly and I was able to install it. However, the titanium silver color is not silver at all, it's just plain gray metal paint. The image is heavily photoshopped, made to look much shiny than it is. The quality is much to be desired, more of a $40 item you would find at Walmart, definitely not worth the money. I have recently bought another TV stand (from BigLots) which is a lot better in quality and costs less. Also, the plastic screw holders for the glass shelves are difficult to install. All in all, pretty disappointed with the purchase. This was my first Amazon letdown, though."
2,A rather convoluted dissapointment,Sadly this book is simply to convoluted to be of much help. Perhaps the books scope (SQL in general) is the books weakest point. It often seems like more time is spent explaining the differences between DBMS's than discussing the fundamentals of SQL. My advice is stay away from this book and instead go with one tailored for your DBMS.
2,Very poorly written,A terribly written book but has many useful examples and only costs $20. The author has no command of the English language at all. The only reason why such poor writing got past the editors in the first place was probably because they had no idea what the hell the author was talking about and thought it was hopeless to fix. Beware.
1,Not usable ... adhesive so strong that they are ruined trying to peel off the paper they came on...,Not usable ... adhesive so strong that they are ruined trying to peel off the paper they came on... also I thought I was getting white as pictured (i see now that is says black in the description) ... low enough price that I am not bothering to return or contact seller unless they choose to contact me after seeing this review.
5,Moses Wine gets his case from his shrink,"As far as I know, the only detective novel in which the [P.I.] gets his cae from his shrink. Highly amusing with a brilliant parody of Richard Pryor.Santa C"
1,awful,"I should have known this book would be bad from the first page. But the reviews were quite good so I gave it a chance. I now regret that decision as this is probably the worst book I have ever read. The plot is predictable, the style reminds me of a junior high-school essay, the characters are straight out of a bad episode of Law and Order Special Victims Unit."
1,a waste of time and money,I found the book oriented to developers who already have reports to work with. I was disappointed in the lack of material presented for creating my own reports and subsequent applications.
1,One of the worst computer books I've read.,"Poorly written, very little, if any, useful information. Some pages are half-blank! The book has a very poor layout. And a lot of the pages are wasted by extra large screen shots. No good examples to follow. The features are explained but the examples are poor. Just opening the program and playing around with it, trying some examples I found on the web, was more useful than this book. I'm going to have to buy the Wrox book now. I had a peek at it in the book store and I liked it."
1,Just Put Online Help in this book!,"Please don't waste your money on this book! It just put MSDN and Crystal Report online help into this book! The examples are also very poor. The author doesn't understand Crystal Report.NET and Visual Studio.NET very well. He just copy some examples from online help or from website because I asked him some questions. Although the book already has the contents, he responsed he doesn't know! I understand why the publisher doesn't want to publish it!"
3,Quick Customer Service,"I've just purchased a copy of this book. On first inspection, the contents look promising. Howerver, the quality control is poor; pages 215 - 246 are missing.Update:The good news is that the author (and self publisher) is very responsive. I sent an email complaining of the missing pages and within a few hours received a response from the author. He's offered to provide a replacement. He's a good guy."
5,Need to know what CR does on the object level? this is the book.,"If you need to know what's going on under the hood of Crystal reports, this book is a must have.I had a requirement that a report be able to draw data through a stored procedure from 1 of 4 versions of a SQL Server 2000 Databases determined at runtime. Without this book I would have been forced to use the Push method.Thanks to this book I was able to write the code to dynamically modify the login information, set the parameters, redirect the data source, and other things inside the ReportDoc object and other objects. I would have never found the UML diagrams and code I needed to track down what to change.There is nowhere on the Net that had what I needed to know about Crystal Reports, this book does."
2,Works great when it works.,"I've used Windmill Stormproof lighters for over 10 years. When they are working, there is no lighter I've ever had that works better. They are light, compact, easy to fill in the clear models and throw a very hot and directed flame. They are windproof enough that I've lit cigarettes on a motorcycle.HHowever, and this is a biggie, they are very poorly designed for reliability. The hinges will break. The lever that opens the top will break. And sometimes they just won't light. This didn't used to be a big deal. You could just send it off to the distributor and they sent you a new one. Now they want to charge you $7.50 for each return and you get to pay the postage to ship it to them. Not much of a ""Lifetime Warranty"" since that almost certainly covers their cost. Bye-bye Windmill."
1,Worked once...that's it.,"Ordered as a Christmas present for my kid who's an avid camper. Filled it with fuel, lit it up just fine the first time, but never lit again. I hear a faint hiss which leads me to believe it's a gas flow problem. Returning to Amazon for refund; that's why I buy on Amazon - they take care of such problems with minimum hassle to the customer. Won't try this brand again."
5,Excellent!,"The Warrior of the Son books make up what is by far my favorite Christian fantasy series. I was blown away by these books! So many other Christian fantasy books are all about magic swords and spell casting. Quite honestly they can be quite cheesy and unoriginal. Yet Mr. Schiller's books are creative and gripping. First off, the Bible is the Bible and Jesus is Jesus in these books. The Christian elements of the series are obvious and I appreciate the straightforwardness. So many other Christian fantasy books are too allegorical. Warrior of the Son doesn't have this problem at all. Secondly, these books are clean. No cussing, no sex, no ridiculous gore. Lastly, I love the way Mr. Schiller incorporates medieval history and culture. The books are both enjoyable and informative. In short, if you are looking for exceptional Christian fantasy then you should read these books. This day for the Lord!"
1,Does not conform to any actual practice. Harmful.,"If your goal is to prepare effectively and efficiently for legal practice, do not use this book. Not a soul actually uses the CREAC formula advocated here, and all you end up doing is unlearning terrible habits you were made to acquire during your first year. Use Aldisert or Neumann instead. The techniques taught in those books conform to real practice, and you will look much more competent and professional if you use them than if you do anything this book advises you to do. If you are not a captive audience, avoid this book at all costs. If you are made to use it in your first year skills course, take CREAC with a grain of salt and be prepared to fix the damage during your first summer job. The technique advocated by this book is simplistic, plodding, and simply does not begin to meet even minimal standards of professional legal writing."
1,Terrible,"This feels like one of those books produced so that it can be put on the syllabus and students are forced to purchase it. It looks harmless enough, as small as it is, but I agree with the previous reviewer who said it is simplistic and plodding. This book has no soul and the components are not well enough articulated to really understand what separates the good legal analysis from the bad. Granted, most legal writing books fail miserably at teaching the substance of legel writing so that students are able to make conscious improvements, but this book is no help. If you're not forced to buy this and are just looking for a good legal writing supplement, pass this one up."
4,nice size pod for 2 people's meal,"this pod seems smaller than what I imagein, but still work out well for 2 people's meal."
2,Not bright enough for a floor lamp,"This lamp is a triumph of style over substance. It looks nice, and the gooseneck would work well for positioning the lamp. But the lamp has only one LED and is way, way too dim to be useful for anything. If there's any outside light coming in through a window, you probably won't be able to even tell that it's on. Disappointing."
5,Hit to the head,"I found this book to be very informative. My husband decided that he was going to go into Quixtar and I was going to be his partner. Needless to say, he's on his own. I read this book when he first told me and I found it to be true. The amount of money that a person spents on a MLM is ridiculous. The Quixtar e-mail, voice mail, and the tapes you have to subscibe to. And that's not counting all the meetings that they want you to attend, at a cost of course. I attended one meeting (against my will) and could not believe how gullible these people were. They believe everything out of the upline's mouth and never question any of it. Just nodded their heads and smiled. If you are serious about going into Quixtar/Amway, read this book first. It will defintely open your eyes."
5,Great resource,I bought this book to write a research paper on multi-level marketing. It was a great source of information! I have family involved in Amway and know all about their shady actions! Great book I would recommend to anyone considering signing on with any MLM.
5,Eyeopening,"Ms. Carter truly has hit the nail on the head with this book. I have also read ""The Quixtar Revolution"". Most things she talks about in the book I have personally encountered. Meetings, tapes, pep talks, rallys etc.We had some friends that we lost touch with a couple of years ago. And suddenly we get a call telling us that they have found this great business opportunity. ""Can we get together and show you the ""PLAN"". Needless to say, we joined. I have decided that some of the products aren't too bad, but I can't NOT tell people that the company is affiliated with Amway. Which is what our 'up-line' told me to do. And I really don't want to have people avoid me because of ""The Business"". I recommend that anyone thinking of joining ANY MLM scheme should read Ms. Carter's book."
1,money from writing a book,"talk about deceit, this lady has an ax to grind, and it doesn't include honesty. does she also mention that she can make money from this book of lies? the only reason i gave 1 star is because it wouldn't take the comment with no stars, and i couldn't figure oyt how to leave a minus."
1,nonesense!,"you will be not successful in Amway without truly understand what Amway/Quixtar means to our lives. The system is a fair system which is backup by lines of good quality products and service. Please can you name another company is as generous as Amway for satisfaction guarantee? it is a win-win business for line of sponsorship, and your customer is also a winner for using the quality, enviromental friendly and cost effective products. The author has not really been into Amway business and has no rights to make such judgement which is unfair to Amway and it's IBOs."
1,Look at yourself in the mirror,"This book is a far cry from what the title portrays.A poor written book where the author tries to convict a business model for her failures.I am not saying there is no truth in the book, but save your money and invest it in something more credible.This book did not answer any questions for me. I suggest gettinginformation about any business from the people that are successful in that particular business."
4,Understand what you've missed not getting into Amway,"Once I was invited by a friend go to a party at his house. To my surprise (and to 5 other friends), the event was not fun at all. There was a guy who we had never seen before, and he kept talking about achievement, dreams, victory, money, etc. Fortunately, one of my friends had been to a meeting like that a couple of week before and said: Why don't tell us you're selling Amway?I've always had a skeptical view towards multilevel-marketing organizations, and this book puts the evidence over the table."
5,Showing the Smoke and Mirrors,"Ms. Carter has provided a thought-provoking service to the public by writing this book. As one of many people burned by the games and falsehoods perpetuated by Multi-Level Marketing/Network Marketing types of organizations, I applaud anyone that writes to provide the public with food for thought before plunging into the MLM morass. Ms. Carter and Mr. Bob Fitzpatrick provide a much-needed service."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IRON,"I bought this iron at a store. I had 2 stop working on me in the span of 7 months. The first only lasted 2.5 months. The third one I got through the warranty was not put together correctly and ripped out my hair. The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then. I was told I could not have a refund because ""the store I bought it from is the company that took my money."" I have never been so frustrated with a company."
2,Extremely disappointing,"I thought I was a British-movie fanatic but apparently not if it means liking this ponderous and boring waste of time. Almost everything mentioned is a 1930's epic of some kind, mostly by Alexander Korda. I'm in my mid-seventies and even for me the 1930's were much too long ago. Forget this one."
3,The Korda years,"I purchased this dvd thinking it was going to be about ALL the best British Films however I found it only foccused on the Alexander Korda years. I'm not saying those were not great years and there was some interesting visuals in this, however the dvd itself is totally misleading in what it contains. Rather expense for what it contained and the very poor image quality."
2,not too good,not too good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is not too good. strange.
3,Alright(I guess)??!!,"Goes on clean and streak free and easy to buff out but it seems to wash away and doesn't last unless you re-apply again and again.Defeated purpose here!Leasves a BIG QUESTION MARK(?) in my mind.Alot of hype i think!!Kinda ""Poey"" if you ask me!!"
4,I agree with Jerry,"I agree with Jerry that the Meguiar's glaze #7 is a very good product. I too have used several different paint cleaning, polishing, glazing and waxing products. I find the Glaze creates a deep reflection in my black paint. The product is not an easy on / off product, so plan some time and have lots of rags for removing the glaze. But the results are worth the time and effort.Be sure to follow-up with a Meguiar's Gold Wax application and later use the express mist on detail / quick wax prodcut for a continued ""wet"" shine.Generally, I like the Meguair's prodcuts - wax's, brushes, towles, liquid car wash and polishes... and the pricing is great."
4,Meguiar's 7 Mirror Glaze Professional Show Car Glaze. 16 oz. liquid,"Without any doubt, this has been the best glaze I have used on my cars so far. Seriously deep shine, almost mirror like and very long lasting."
4,Meguiar's M-0716 Mirror Glaze Professional Show Car Glaze,"Good, hard, deep shine. Holds up well after exposure to rain. Recommend to anyone for in-between heavy waxings."
3,odd,"The Roches do folk/rock, and it sounds uncomfortable. They didn't seem to have found a decent producer after parting with Robert Fripp, but Teddy Wainwright (who produced A Dove) finally came up with the goods on their more recent effort, Can We Go Home Now. On A Dove it still sounds like they're treading water. For fans only."
5,"Brilliant, engaging, and highly readable","With hundreds of marketing books available, it's difficult to determine which ones are really valuable. ""Brain Tattoos"" is one of the few that really deliver the goods.Establishing a brand is usually more for the corporate players. The big guys can just buy enough advertising to build a brand. But it's not that simple to build a sticky brand.""Brain Tattoos"" delivers its message with a terrific style, simple directives and a lot useful tips. It's not an academic textbook that will only be referenced once. You'll go back to this book over and over.What I like most is how readable the book is. It's a great companion on a business trip. Just bring a pad of paper - you'll want to write down all the ideas this book generates."
3,Not as noted on package,"The song's listed on the label were not correct. The only reason I bought this CD was for one song only,""Sweet Victory"" and it wasn't on there. Beware if you order for this reason. There is two disk in this cd but both of them are number 2, there is no number 1.Very disapointed."
5,Helps me on bad days,"I like this CD also. It helps me get through some bad days. I enjoy some of the older hymns which we may not sing in our church as much if ever. Some of them I remember singing with my cousin when I visited her house and my grandmother would like for us to sine. My cousin played piano, so we really liked to do that. Grandma also had favorites which we would sing, some of which are on this CD."
4,Beware 7th gen Corolla owners!! ('93-'97),"Note : This review applies to all four silver KYB GR-2 struts, not just this front (passenger side?) one.I've had these installed on a 1993 Toyota Corolla for two+ years, since spring 2009, maybe 30K miles. KYB was the OEM of my Toyota's struts. Be warned -- THESE ARE NOT A GOOD MATCH FOR THE STOCK SPRINGS. Oh, they fit just fine, but the ride they deliver can only be described as ""punishing."" If you love road feel and limited body roll, pair these with your stock Toyota springs and you'll get all the road feel you can stomach. If you want a more comfortable ride with nicely damped bumps, stick with the stock struts. These silver GR-2s are better paired with Eibach aftermarket springs, or so I hear.Personally I rue the day I installed these. I'm docking them one star to reflect my displeasure.Special Packaging Notice: KYB is changing the name of GR-2 shocks and struts to Excel-G. Their part numbers and performance remain the same--only the name is changing."
2,"Funny, but not informative",The author takes a humorous approach at describing British life and its oddities but the information is mostly stereotypical. Each page describes a different aspect of life in Great Britian. While the cartoon illustrations brought a smile to my face this is not a useful guide to understanding the British.
2,A lot of words on basic stuff,"This book doesn't cover much you probably couldn't have figured out on your own. You'll bypass the scope of this book in a couple of days or weeks, at which point you'll want to get something bigger and broader in scope. This book is also WAY too padded with theoretical junk on how project planning works. Isn't Project98 supposed to help bypass a lot of the ""theory""?"
2,FAILS TO CAPITALIZE ON GOOD BEGINNING,"The premise behind ORBITAL BURN, a down on her luck private investigator helping a talking dog find a manufactured kid. Well it sounded good at the beginning and even started out fairly well. Unfortunately it went down hill pretty quickly.Like I said the premise had potential and the characters could have been a gold mine, but that wasn't to be. In fact the plot meandered all over the place with little coherent direction and the characters remained flat and uninteresting. The ending was, well the best thing I can say about it is that it wasn't predictable. Of course it wasn't predictable because it seemed to have so little relationship to the storyline. It was also anticlimactic and a bit forced.To damn with faint praise I'd say good try, better luck next time.NOT RECOMMENDED"
2,Not so good,"After 15 months use, repairs needed. A$360 worth of parts, still not repaired. Should not have bought a combination unit"
4,DTS??,"I've had this system for a while now, and I love it, my only problem with it is that because the front speaker wires are too short so you can't spread them far apart, and it does not decode DTS, other than than it sounds great!"
1,Don't waste money,This system to me is a waste of money. I payed a lot more for mysystem but for a hundred more dollars I could get a dedicated home theater. The only good thing about this system are the dual woofers and the five disc dvd player. But the player probably doesn't have component video output or progessive scan for improved picture on HDTV. Anyone who knows anything about home theater would agree with me this system isn't the best around.
2,I LOVE THE SMELL OF DEATH IN THE MORNING,"The film starts out with a dark cemetery killing followed by an odd, poorly scripted interrogation. We then jump to two years later with Jake(Dennis O'Connor) and Ed (Jaimz Woolvett) being grave diggers discovering something unusual. Meanwhile,there is another poorly scripted unlikely restaurant scene where our hunter (Stephen McHattie) ends up in bed with the waitress ((Cynthia Belliveau) after being stabbed. The fight scene was poorly constructed.The movie wasn't a bad horror idea. The poor script and execution made for tedious watching coupled with the so-so special effects. Neve Campbell has a supporting role. Surprisingly, she went on to have a career after this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Cynthia Belliveau)"
1,A Waste of Money,"This book has very simplistic ideas and lacks the constructive solutions that I hoped to learn. For example, her advice for dealing with people prone to explosive temper is ""If you stay around someone and feel you are walking on eggshells, find ways to handle the eggs--and that person--more gently so the shells don't break."" Reading her advice made me wonder what kind of education and experience she has that qualifies her to write such a book. Interestingly enough, there's very little information about that in her bio. It looks like her Ph.D is in journalism or English. I would love to send this book back and get my money back. I would probably spend it better on a book written by an educated, credentialed, psychologist who understands the difference between constructively handling people with behavior problems versus enabling them to continue to abuse others and make work life hades."
3,Dealing with office conflicts,"When faced with whiners, know-it-alls and other problem personalities in the office, this is book can be helpful with the many anecdotes and solutions that it presents. However, I rate this lower than other books out there. A better book, in my opinion, will ""Dealing with People You Can't Stand: How to Bring Out the Best in People at Their Worst"", author Rick Brinkman. I prefer the Brinkman book for providing an easier-to-remember template for identifying the types of problem-personalities, the possible underlying reasons as to their behavior, and a set of action-steps to deal with people who are behaving at their worst."
1,Not made by Kidde as advertised.,Not made by Kidde as advertised.Made by Fyrnetics.Don't let this company fool you it is not a kidde product.
4,This CD compilation just makes me feel good!,"Having been a long-time fan of Northern Exposure, I was really pleased to see this CD at a used bookstore the other day and quickly snapped it up. There are 12 tracks on this CD, and some of my favorites are the theme music [of course] -such a quirky composition so evocative of the show's spirit,Jolie Louise[ by Daniel Lanois], At Last[Etta James], and When I Grow Too Old to Dream [Nat King Cole], among others. Listening to some of these tracks was like a walk down memory lane for me, remembering some of the scenes in which the songs were played. Like a long-time friend or good book, this CD is a wonderful companion on a lazy afternoon."
3,Caribbean Blue,"If you remember the episode where Hollinghas to bury Jesse, and Chris is reading thePaddle to the Sea excerpts, then you probablyremember that incredible Enya music at the endof the 3rd season episode named THE FINAL FRONTIER.The Enya track is from Sheperd Moons, CaribbeanBlue."
5,Sunday Morning,"There are times in our life when things seem somehow surreal, almost perfect. This album makes me think of those ""good times."" Memories often relate back to sensory experiences ... for me it's often music. This album reminds me of perfect late afternoon light falling on my young sons at play, or the soft brown color of my old, well-used rolltop desk, a great dinner with the one you love or even your favorite book. It's good, it's comfortable, without being trite, it's like coming home.One perfect August Sunday afternoon this CD was on and I looked up at old yellow single-seat float plane winging it's way over my house. I'll never forget it.Buy this album, you'll never regret it and you'll never stop listening to it.tk"
5,You'll Love This!,"Strange thing about this CD - it makes you love songs and types of music that would have previously have made you cringe! Etta James, Nat King Cole - not the sort of thing that a Techno-junkie would ever consider. But by God you just can't stop listening! You will love this CD! And Yes - it really does remind you of the show. You want to watch the repeats all over again simply to find out how the songs were used in the show. An Excellent Soundtrack - Brave and Fullfilling!"
1,RIPOFF,"Great music -- but only 42 minutes of it! The record company could EASILY have added another 20-30 minutes of material -- most notably, the native-American music so many other people here noted is in short supply on this disk.Do yourself a favor -- look at the songlist here and buy a couple of THOSE disks outright!"
2,Disappointing,"I loved the show and its quirky, moving music and purchased this because of the very high customer reviews. I was disappointed in the cd. I consider the pieces a mix of 60's nostalgia songs little different than what one would hear on a ""smooth rock"" chain radio station. Granted, the cd has two important, distinguished classics (Etta James ""At Last"" and Nat King Cole's ""When I Grow Too Old to Dream""), but you'd be better off spending twice the money and buying the two original cd's to get the songs instead of purchasing this cd, unless, of course, you're a fan of the other selections. Be sure to check the song list and make sure they are all songs you love.I did learn something valuable from this purchase, however: don't rely too greatly on customer reviews."
1,vthompson,"I have not received the CD yet, it has been a month, so I really don't know how many stars to give it..."
1,Great Disapointment,The music wasn't any of the good songs that are normally associated with the show.
1,Very disappointed,"Just listening to the previews here has made me decide not to buy. I was looking the unique sound the show had, ethnic if you must. But all I heard here was what I consider ""canned"". Sigh. Wish someone would get the true, original music."
3,more Northern Exposure featured tracks,"If you have in mind the ""Jules et Joel"" episode, the 5th in the 3rd series and probably my favourite episode from my favourite tv series indeed, I think that a lot of its atmosphere is provided by the main theme in that episode, ""Flight of the cosmic hippo"" by B?la Fleck and The Flecktones. You really should listen to them if you don't know them already, I discovered them by chance and because of this song, and I can't recommend them strongly enough. One of the best (and least known) bands ever."
5,A lovely and imaginative work,"Well, what can I say? I'm seventeen and I still enjoy reading my copy of this book from time to time. The story is creative, exciting, and fast-moving, and the world White describes is so rich and lovely. The scope of this story and the lessons skillfully woven into it make this a wonderful choice for older children, but again, as I said, I don't think I will ever tire of this series. This is truly enjoyable fantasy writing; one of those books you can lose yourself in on a rainy day."
4,First trial,"This book was very,very good to me! This is my first time reading a Donald Goines novel( that's why the review is titled first trial), and I was pleased with the results! This book kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The fistfights, were interesting and I kept reading because I kept wanting to see what was going to happen. The characters were pretty realistic and the plot was great. A son robs his own father's number's house with friends and things the story gets better after that. The ending was alright, not to bad. I also appreciated the armed robbery parts. Those were suspenseful! The book is worth buying and I'm looking for more of his works! It was close to 5 stars!"
1,"great ""blaxploitation"" rudimentary writing","I find it incredulous that anyone could enjoy ""Eldorado Red"". This insipid work is indicative of a writer who lacks basic writing fundementals. The book lacks any character distinction and it became evident very early the author would give black sterotypes free reign. I am highly disappointed and would urge perspective readers to disregard it."
3,"Good reference, poorly edited","What's great about Mao's book is that so many aspects of cryptography are covered in an approachable manner and with many good examples.What's not so great about Mao's book is that it is chock full of errors. There are many mathematical typos. But what really kills this book for me are the ridiculous number of English mistakes - on average about two or three per page. Most mistakes are simple grammatical mistakes that can be re-parsed by the reader on the fly. However, there are more serious errors that make it very difficult to understand the meaning of significant passages and concepts.Given Mao's refreshing conversational style it's a real shame that Prentice Hall couldn't come up with some decent editing. Hopefully a second edition will fix this."
4,It's a College TextBook,"It's a pretty good one too, but it's still a college text. The orientation of this book is far more theoretical than practical, complete with abstract mathematical notation that sometimes does more to confuse than to elucidate (although the author, to his credit, includes a glossary of mathematical notation early in the text). Still, the book is complete and up-to-date, covering everything from probability theory and number theory through the latest stuff on PKI, symmetric crypto (including AES), and authentication.Cryptography is not an easy subject, and this book will take a while to wade through for all but the most mathematically astute readers. Nonetheless, for those wanting a ""deep dive"" into the theoretical underpinnings of the subject, this is a good book. Security practitioners will likely find Schneier's ""Applied Cryptography"" an easier, more enjoyable, and equally beneficial read, although it is due for an update."
3,Not bad,"Much better than the flash on my Nikon D80, but I was hoping for a bit more light out of this unit. Though much more inexpensive than other flash units, you get what you pay for, as this model was fairly cheap."
5,Use on a D5100,"I purchased this because of Ken Rockwell's reviews of it. I have used it a tiny bit and have really liked the results of the pictures so far. The size is so handy when you just need a little extra light. The only problem is turning your camera vertically, there's no way of bouncing light off the ceiling."
3,"No bells or whistles, but competent.","This is a no-frills VCR. I wanted a VCR that plays and records VHS tapes and nothing more. This unit does that and does it well. I consider it a great value for the price. I had to supply my own cords for a video connection, but this was the only downside."
3,Outdated VCR,"It's just OK. Wanted a plain VCR to play some old VHS movies, this player skips and jumps a bit but it works . Watch out for WorldWide Distributers though, archaic ""we can make it up on shipping and handling"" online sales profit mentality. Paid 1/3 the price of the VCR for shipping and handling because I didn't catch the fine print."
5,Love this vcr!,"It works great, it's clear, it's perfect! After having so many other vcrs that gave me trouble, it's great to have one that works like it's supposed to."
4,OK so far--for 2 months it's worked fine,"So far the machine has worked fine. It is a little more complicated to program than other brands, but it gets the job done. It was the only new VCR I could find. It is too bad that corporations refuse to make what the public wants to buy--VCRs--but that is what happens when monopoly capitalism takes over the world economy."
2,"Advertised new, got not new","The VCR plays about the way I thought it would, picture about as good as the quality of the VCR except a little dark, sound as good as my TV can supply. My biggest disappointment was that the product was advertised as new ( I went back and checked the check out description and it still said new) but received either a reconditioned or used unit. Th telltale signs were no warranty information cards included in the box, the power cord was hand folded and some of the serial numbers were blacked out-very disappointing."
5,Valuable addition to home library,"In this cynical, troubled age, how wonderful it is to have a quote book such as this. It is replete with quotations that not only make one ""feel good"", but that are often profound and that encourage one to ruminate over life's issues and challenges. Not every quote (or quoter) represented in the book is inspiring, or even the best choice, but the very great majority of the content of this tome is indeed worthwhile. The book would be a recommended purchase at even a much higher price than the present offering. As it is, the publication is a must-buy, considering both price and content!"
5,Its a great book!,"I am a quotation fanatic, and I found this book full of ones I have never heard before. It has great cross-referencing, and the best part is, all the quotes are positive. It makes you think when you've had a bad day. An all around great book!"
3,"Fantastic film, terrible DVD","This is a great movie and one I was very much looking forward to buying on DVD. However, the DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs. So you either have to watch it at half the size in the middle of your screen or blow it up, with makes the already fuzzy picture (16mm) even fuzzier. Kind of hard to believe that in 2010, when everyone is buying LCDs and plasmas, that Kino could actually release something like this and charge normal DVD price for it. Well, they got me, mainly because there is so little info about this release on the internet. So just be warned, if you have a widescreen HDTV, you are kind of left out of the loop on this one. Unfortunately, a film as small as this may never be released again. That's a shame, because it is truly worth watching."
2,Loren Cass,"This movie is hard to follow. It has very little dialogue, they go on a date and stare at each other the entire time lol. I bought it because of where the movie was shot, in my hometown of st. pete, but it did not live up to my expectations. Different strokes for different folks though"
5,New Eyes,"Fail to see the forest for the trees? Well, you came to the right place. By reading Steven C. Scheer's Hollywood Values I am watching every movie I have ever seen again. And the new movies I am watching, I am watching with new eyes. After reading Hollywood Values I have a new-found ability to understand the hidden meanings in movies, and I am no longer caught up with what's merely obvious or what society tells me might be offensive. Thanks to Steven C. Scheer's brilliant explanation of the right way to watch and enjoy movies, I have what I might call a second chance to watch all the classics all over again and not miss the things I seem to have missed before. Hollywood Values is a very enjoyable and enlightening book to read.Candice Lee Sundstrolm"
3,A Slight Bit of Confusion,This is a note to people who might be a bit confused. There is an excellent manga series also entitled Oh My Goddess!(or sometimes Ah My Goddess!). It has nothing to do with this book. Be forewarned.
2,Get what you pay for,"I wish I would have listened more to the reviews about this backpack being poorly made. Yes, it will fall apart within months of purchasing it."
2,Not as We expected,"Rather small with minimal storage space. Nylon parts felt extremely thin and did not seem like they would hold up to the day to day use of your typical fourth grader. Perhaps it would make a stylish first backpack, once your child outgrows the type with characters and such....but they would have to be relatively young."
1,Disappointed Mom,I bought this back pack for my kindergartener when he started school in August. I have had to replace the bag as the bottom is disintegrating and the main zipper keeps seperating. I found it only because my son had little black flecks all over his library books and lunch bag. I held the backpack up and could see right through the bottom of the bag. This is not a durable backpack. It a kindergartener can't utilize it I can't imagine it would hold up to an older child or adult. I was very disappointed in this bag.
2,Not long duration,"I bought this backpack for my daughter who is in high school so she will be using a lot of books and notebooks. She was using it for maybe 2 weeks before she saw a rip in the backpack, where all the pencils, pens, etc go. That's not even where she puts her heavy books or anything. Now she doesn't put her books in her backpack because she's scared it will rip even more. She likes the backpack, very stylish for her but we are expecting it to not last by the end of the year. If you are looking for a backpack that doesn't hold too much, this is for you, but for a school backpack I do not recommend it."
4,Ternose,This is a wonderful nice book even if you are not able to read hebrew texts. It helps to find explanation on words and sentences that enlarges the knowledge of biblical texts. This is a short review based on a few texts studied.
4,"Well written, short & to the point","I am not involved in network marketing or person-to-person sales of any sort but even I could see how a person building a network could use this book.The author starts by telling about his own early sales experience and boils down most success as persistance. I have to agree with that actually getting it done is necessary in most fields. Then he goes into his own sales method and winds the book up with body language tips for making a good impression.As far as the sales method goes, the author presents a method of having the prospect tell you what he wants and how your product fits in with it that could help in any type of sales or persuasion.The main thing that seems to be missing is a discussion of how to pick out which network to join up with if you don't have the luck to be approached and sold on the one that's the best for you."
5,Awesome !!,"This is the book I've been waiting for...It's been around for a while but I just found it.It's an awesome experience that what you've known it but not able to summarize it in a systematic level is in front of you as a book. That's how I felt about this book while reading it.To me, it is a tool to organize/explain this thoughts to others. It seems like I've just found an organized summary of your point of view in this book.I just absolutely love this book .."
1,WARNING: Bugs/Logos on the screen!!!,"Absolutely unforgiveable! Never never put logos/bugs in the corner of the screen on DVD releases. If I am going to invest money on buying a DVD, I do not wish for it to look like I am watching the program on television. Obviously Passport has a problem with people possibly copying the discs, but trying to prevent piracy this way is bad for business. Do not patronize this company or their inferior discs. One star because the ""bugs"" blew it for me!"
2,A Poor Tribute to Gloria,"This compilation has poor video quality and - the largest sin of all - it leaves out the final reel of ""Don't Change Your Husband""! If you are a silent film lover, leave this mess alone and buy the higher quality DVD's which are available for most of the titles. Now I still have to buy a copy of ""Don't Change Your Husband"" to get the entire film."
3,"This is a silent movie, and so it has no soundtrack.","I have not seen this movie, although one of my video books gives it 3 stars out of a possible 5. Generally all DeMille films of whatever era (from 1914-1956) are entertaining in an over the top way. Male and Female was made in 1919, almost ten years before sound movies were commonly made, and so the earlier reviewers comments about the faulty soundtrack are incorrect."
1,JESUS IS COMING AT THE LAST DAY.,"It is so simple. You interpret the unclear verses by the clear verses in the Bible.Jesus says: ""Everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day""(John 6:40).""At the last day"" - not 7 or 1007 years before the last day as Hunt believes.Jesus says: ""There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words. That very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day."" (John 12:48)Hunt needs to accept the word of Jesus when He says ""at the last day.""Jesus says: ""The hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear my voice and come out. Those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned."" (John 5:28-29)Hunt inserts 1000 years between Jesus' call and ignores the word ""all"".See 2 Peter 3:10-13 for a description of the last day. The rest of the Bible agrees with Jesus not Hunt.Mike"
5,good ole metal,this cd takes back to years and was delivered just the way i was promised. thank you.
1,Not good.,"This is not a good thrash album in the least. Very generic and nothing special, hence a typical Floatsam album."
1,Poor Product,"I also tried this product, and you have to split the movie between 2 dvds to make your copy. I like 123 copy dvd better."
1,DVD Copy Now,"Disapointed, not very good product compare to dvd Fab or shrink, Roxio. not worth the money, not matter how low price."
4,trv-510,"I bought the big brother, the 510, but not at Amazon. This camera is TOO COOL! Lots of features. The 510 has a serial output for your computer if it doesn't have fire wire. Bigger 4 inch screen and color viewfinder. Uses cheaper 8mm and hi-8 tapes; I can't tell the difference. Biggest gripe: As all digital camcorders (?), will only stay in stby 3 minutes, then switches off! Stupid. Shooting wildlife, getting the shot is more important than the charge on a battery. Get the larger battery and use the original as a backup. Also get an aftermarket battery holder so you can charge it outside the camera. It's dumb to tie up your camera just so you can re-charge."
3,"Nice Camera -- but very unhappy with ""clarity"" upon viewing!","I have had the 310 for about 2 months -- I am not sure if it's something I'M doing but when I watch the video on TV (i.e., with the cables hooked to the camera) -- it seems like some shots are pretty clear and others are VERY VERY ""grainy"" and this is very upsetting to me -- after all I thought I was paying for ""digital"" and that that was supposed to give me the best possible picture ever! I have tried the different ""auto exporsure"" icons and it seems that that improves the picture a good deal -- but I wouldn't say it's the ""greatest"" picture I've ever seen! Thank you!"
4,B and W view finder,The B&W viewfinder is better than color for manual focus and contrast. Having both in the package is a plus and not a negative.
1,NOT WORTH,"Sony TRV 310 is not worth for 999.99. The accessories are very expensive, with out accessories you can not enjoy with this camcorder.I do not recoment this product to other people."
5,Sony digital Handycam,This camcorder is great and has every feature you need. It is self expainatory and easy to use. The best feature is the digital camera which takes photos along with being a digital recorder. The only thing that would make it better is if it recorded onto a floppy. The color screen monitor is awesome and the microphone picks up every quite detail. It is well worth the investment and we enjoy it a lot!
1,Bad quality and not good.,This sony camcorder TRV 310 is having IC defalt and after few hours of use screen will flash and the system will shut down.This is not worth at all.I do not recoment any one to buy this product.
4,Installation Guide is Confusing,"While using Maxtor's drive in my computer since 2/2002, I cannot say anything negative about Maxtor product. I bought this 60GB drive to upgrade that OEM (DELL) installed drive. The first impression and observation: the new drive is much quieter than the old one; the core made from plastic vs. from aluminum, in the old one.However, I found the installation steps, in the supplied Installation Guide, being confusing and, in the situation similar to mine, unfinished, i.e., abruptly ending. If I exactly followed the steps, I would not be able to boot my system and make the computer operational.Note: I installed the drive as a Replacement Boot Drive."
1,this thing's a piece,"died on me after 7 months. Sure, the warranty will get me a new (blank) one - what about all my data?"
4,Good value HD,I like the brand and the price. the copy utility is working only if your old harddrive had no bad sectors.
4,Required for college course,This book was required reading for m Science Fiction in Literature course. I am not a Sci Fi buff by any means but I found this movie to be entertaining.
1,UGH,I thought this was something I could use to install an aftermarket radio in a caravan. Turns out it's not. Misleading IMO. It's something you would use for an FM mod changer or something of that nature. Way to list the item wrong AI. Luckily I was able to exchange it at a local friendly merchant so as the not derail the plan
5,Great and cute too!,"We have the purple cat for our 3 year old and the pink hippo for our 5 year old and they love them - they are so cute that they treat them like a stuffed toy and don't mind putting them around their neck in the car or plane when I suggest they do! I'm now looking to get one for our 18 month old, I just can't decide which one!!! they are all so cute!"
3,"at last, neck pillow for children and appealing to children","soft and cuddly, depends upon child as to how useful it really is, but great concept and product"
1,100% Junk,"This DVD is a bunch of bull, I am in Methadone Maintenance Treatment and it is nothing like this is showing. If it wasn't for M.M.T I'm not sure where I would be right now, it SAVED my life. I went from living anywhere I could stay and doing drug after drug to now 9 months after I started treatment I have a full time job, i have my own home, my own vehicle, and I completed test for my GED which i now have. M.M.T gave me my life back I now have a happy family and 2 dogs."
1,False Impressions,I watched this movie when it came out. At the time I was on methadone. I was extremely disappointed by it-this film only shows one side of the story of methadone. It only shows people who are still abusing other drugs. It completely ignores the large number of patients who do well on methadone and get their lives back. This film just perpetuates the negative stereotypes associated with methadone treatment. This serves to shame people who are doing well on methadone. A balanced documentary would have shown both sides-people who are doing well and people who aren't. Instead it plays into people's expectations by only showing the bad.
5,Doble Eclipse ROXX!!Hardline Forever...,"Hello and Good Day! This certainly is NOT your typical rock and roll cd. John Gioeli vocals are raw real and very emotional! Joey guitar shreds! The music is groovin' bluesy and very catchy.All tracks starting from Life's a Bitch is full of serious rythnm and Dr.Love! well, John the vocalist has a great pair of lungs.All tracks are super rockn' and the ballads are sensational. Taken' Me Down is remarkable. I can't say more to establish how much talent and serious rythmn and GREAT musicianship this cd dispays~ all tracks have Very Very catchy tunes!~ BUY it, and do yourself a huge favor......NOTHING like it EVER!! Hardline Roxx!! Miss Kelly"
4,"Quite simply, a great album!","After only one or two listens to this album, I was convinced that Neal Schon had been passed down from heaven. His playing and arrangement is simply fantastic. Everything in this album is enjoyable. If you want melodic rockers; ""Dr.Love"" or ""Everything"" are there...If you want ballads;"" The hands of time"" is wonderful. The album seems to be a concoction of several different styles that are professional, heartfelt, and above all powerful. Great vocals and music! Highly recommended for fans of Neal Schon/Journey."
3,"2 great songs, the rest are mediocre","Two songs on this album I would give 5 stars: Rhythm from a Red Car, and Hot Cherie. Both are instant downloads. The rest of the songs on the album range from ""average"" to ""not that great"". If every song was as good as ""Rhythm.."" it would be a 5 star album."
1,major letdown,"This reads like a high school book report. It spends a lot of time dealing with the plot but never actually pinpoints the moral of the story. You don't put this book down with a greater sense of appreciation or understanding for the band. It never discusses the impact they had on modern music (except a few sentences about ""goth rock"".) Not many band biographies are actually good reading. A lot of them fall short in the same ways I mentioned above, but they at least attempt to make up for it with lots of photos, lyrics, song interpretations, and the like. This book offers none of that. No lyrics save for the occasional line hidden in the chapters. The photos have all been seen before. It's a mediocre book about a great band. Unfortunately there aren't other books out on them right now, so if you want to read about them you haven't got much of a choice. If you are starved for Bauhaus info I guess this book is worth reading, but you shouldn't expect much out of it."
2,Disaster strikes for DV fans,"Let's give Forgiven Now a 10/10 and Dumb as Magnets an 8/10. Panic Bell earns a 3/10. As noted, I made a rather huge Error In Fact. The album title is The Dumbest Magnets. Sloppy. My bad. Since I am here, I might as well finish off the other albums: The Thrill Of Gravity 7/10; Dolly Varden Live at Schubas 4/24/03 gets a 9/10. And as penance, I listed to The Panic Bell again. Still didn't like it. Very dirgelike.Remember: Dangerously Thin; Time For Me To Leave; 1000 Men Like Cigarettes; Disappear; and Trying To Live Up (one of the best rock songs ever recorded)? Well, you won't find much of that on The Panic Bell. I don't imagine the band's multi-year hiatus between albums was a particularly great idea. I do, however, find the title, The Panic Bell, (possibly intentionally) ironic."
2,"Homies, Go Home","My son and I were both disapppointed in this video. It is not a ""show""; it is a series of mock-commercials and totally not appropriate for children. It seems very amateurish; even videos on youtube are more inventive. I don't know how this thing got the financing to get produced! A total no-buy from me."
1,2 different sizes came,when they came i looked at them and put them back in the box til it was warm enough to put on my truck. I just relized theyre 2 different sizes and i guess im beat
4,very good early stooges with a guest bit by Lucille Ball,"the stooges are mistaken for the famous""3horsemen"" collage football greats and get mixed up with mobsters to try and win the big game .not their best but one of the first on film with moe ,larry and curly all very young"
4,Lucy and The Three Stooges.,"THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS- An excellent Three Stooges short. Lucille Ball co-stars in this short and is her funny ""Lucy"" self, especially talking in pig latin. ""Oh onay."" Walter Long, who is a foe for Laurel and Hardy, also stars in this short. An excellent short, worth your time.DIZZY DETECTIVES is another great short. The opening where the Stooges work at a wood shop is funny. The fight at the end was great too. A great short.SOCK-A-BYE BABY- A good short. The chase at the end is the best part. Dudley Dickerson is a funny worker toward the end of the short. This is worth your time.The Stooges and Lucy. Who could ask for anything more."
5,EARLY STOOGES ROCK!!!!,"This was filmed in the stooges' early days. Lucille Ball was in this episode. I found it funny when Larry was hitting on her. I later found out that when the stooges where tackled by an apposing football team, six people either got broken arms or legs. It's a good thing they had stunt doubles!!"
3,SOCK THREE LITTLE DETECTIVES,"THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS (1934) - One of the boys earlier shorts, and this is a great one. The part with the Stooges falling down the dumbwaiter is a hoot, and the football scenes in the last half is the highlight. Look for an early appearance from Lucille Ball as a gun moll.DIZZY DETECTIVES (1943) - A great short. I like all the scenes at the old antique store, especially with the ape. The only downer is that the opening scene is reused from PARDON MY SCOTCH (1935). That seemed desperate, and couldn't they think of anything new?SOCK-A-BYE BABY (1942) - The boys did a lot of ""baby"" shorts, and I never liked any of them. In this particular short, there are too many tenderhearted scenes with the baby, and not enough Three Stooges slapstick - and the slapstick we get seems forced. The ending here had no sting."
4,outstanding picture,"""They dont make em like they usta"",and maybe they do and maybe they dont, but this movie in my mind is a classic example of the great pictures of the 1930s.The movie makers and their audience were products of their time, and even if the makers/audience are different today, many movie fans can still recognize great pictures when they see one and the Dawn Patrol is certainly one of these."
4,THE DAWN PATROL,"The Dawn Patrol is very old movie and probably a little outdated but the acting and the story line holds up over time.Errol Flynn, David Niven and Basil Rathbone make this war film a very enjoyable movie, The acting is first rate and the relationship between the three main players makes the story work.Must watch."
4,The Dawn Patrol,"Flynn, Rathbone, Niven ... it doesn't get better than this. And, the movie is still in black and white. Hurry up and buy this movie. I'm a big fan of these three actors for this film and there other films. Why four stars and not five ... well, to me it's a five star film, but I try to be as objective and hard grading as possible. The acting and the story line holds up over time, and for its time showed, war as not glorious and without dire consequences. Indeed no one wins a war, some merely survive and go on as best they can. That said, there are some almost syrupy scenes, but probably more authentic than I give them credit. The relationship between the three main players makes this story work.A must buy, and a must watch."
5,Hystorical interest!,"Errol Flynn used to belong to my childhood's pirates movies. I was surprised on how charming and convincing he acts in this film. An excelent plot, also excelent actors (I had never heard of Basil Rathbone, it seems to me excelent!).My hystorical interest on WWI planes was pleased: it is very interesting to see how rotary engine equipped planes looked like, the way they rocked on taxiing, their noise, the awkward way to take off, etc.Remembers my how disapponting is ""Fly Boys"" in this way that, in a so resourceful digital era, was technically so inexact."
4,Suspense on the Rock,"The murder of a well-dressed woman on the barrens leads you into a quirky and engaging tale set in Newfoundland, complete with separation politics, sexual intrigue, and vivid characters from different strata of society. The tale bumps along like an offroad journey, but the author maintains a lively tale and keeps an offbeat set of narrative threads moving forward. I found certain characters were more vivid than others, but overall, a fascinating story that can hold your interest to the end."
2,confused...,"this cable carries the sound good and theres no crackling when you move the cable back and fourth, but the ends are too short. on the cable i got, the jack sticks in the guitar and works fine, but falls out very easy. i even compared the ends to the jacks on my other cords, theyre all a couple millimeters longer. i solved the problem by putting a rubberband around the jack and stretching it to my volume knob. it has been working fine so far, but the jacks should still be longer, im assuming that maybe the cord is made in europe or something and the jacks are slightly shorter there, but that seems impossible. it can be a defect, because they use the same mold for all the jacks, and the other 2 reviews said nothing about the length of the jacks, so i dont really know what to think, but i would recomend buying a different cord"
5,A superb baby shower gift,"The City Parent Handbook: The Complete Guide To The Ups And Downs And Ins And Outs Of Raising Young Kids In The City by big city parents Kathy Bishop (Editorial Consultant, Meredith Publishing) and Julia Whitehead (president of the strategic and financial consulting firm Pearson Enterprises) is the first comprehensive and ""reader friendly"" parenting manual specifically focused on raising very young children as part of the urban family. Written to focus on the difficulties of raising children from infancy to kindergarten age, The City Parent Handbook deals with issues of keeping sane in small spaces, common city health hazards, safety issues, ways to relieve city stress, dealing with private or public city schools, and much more. Packed with useful and practical information, The City Parent Handbook is a superb baby shower gift, and a very handy wealth of suggestions, tips, tricks, and techniques."
5,very good graphics,"some of best graphics in anime good storyline exiting characters, deserves 7 stars"
2,No End,"This one ends the same as the first two: With a cliff-hanger. Some questions get answered, but there still is no ending. And since it was made quite a few years ago, I doubt there will be any more."
2,Spawn,"Spawn is a resurrected U.S. soldier/assassin who made himself one bad deal with Hell and tries to make things right. Or something like that. It probably wasn't a good idea to immerse myself in Spawn with SPAWN 3, a compilation of episodes from the third season of the HBO animated series.However, after seeing SPAWN 3, I'm not at all anxious to investigate 1 or 2. The animation is good to very good but my gosh this in one slow moving action story. Even a neophyte like me could pick up on most of the important plot points because this movie tends to repeat things over and over and over. I realize this is supposed to be a mature comic aimed at an adult audience, but I found its philosophical musings shallow and trite. If I'd been paying more attention I might have found them laughable.If you want to watch an angst-driven animated hero, or anti-hero, with really bad teeth and a cool, life-of-its-own costume, give this one a shot."
5,Compeling data & approach,A million thanks to Dr. Whitfield for helping me. An answer to my prayers - after numerous failed attempts with conventional psychiatry and their antidepressant drugs that didn't help me and often made me feel worse.
1,READ THE ORIGINAL...,"ALICE MILLER, PHD., WROTE DRAMA OF THE GIFTED CHILD FIRST AND FOREMOST. THIS BOOK, THIN AND EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE, WILL RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR DEPRESSION BY LEADING YOU TO ITS CAUSE - WHICH SETS YOU ON THE ONLY PATH TO LIVING LIFE AS THE PERSON YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE."
1,Not at all what the product title was.,"The description said Enamel on STEEL Burner Cover Set, It was junk! It ispainted tin. I was very disappointed. I actually would give it a (0) zero rating, I could buy these at Wal-Mart anytime, I thought Amozon would be so much better."
4,Good movie,"Kanhaiya was directed by Om Prakash in the year 1959.This old hindi bollywood stars Raj Kapoor, Nutan Behl and Lalita Pawar. Its one of the top Back and Whites, who took the highest gross for the year 1959.The movie is quite popular among freaks.Music of the movie is given by Shankar Jaikishan and lyrics by Shailendra. Songs are good and are sung by Mukesh Kumar.Overall, the movie is cool!"
3,Auto Shutoff - Obvious Design Flaw,"Don't buy this is you need to rely on the auto shutoff. As mentioned by other reviewers, it simply stops working over time, and the machine has to be manually turned off completely when done. If left in the 'Auto' position, it will turn on and just run!! Very loud, and 10 sheets is optimistic."
2,"Does the job, but could be alot better","As is mentioned by several other reviewers, the shredder is very loud. Recently, the auto-stop function stopped working. The warranty won't help as labor coverage is good only 90 days after purchase. So, I guess we'll have to live with it. I'd recommend buying something else."
2,If you like the sound of a small jet engine roaring...,"Buy this machine. It is so loud. Way too loud. I am curious as to how many decibels it produces. I purchased it thinking it would be a great addition for my small office. However, I am taking it back to the store tomorrow. It is just way too loud for my ears. We have another shredder from the 90s that isn't as loud as this one. I would have thought the technology would have changed in the last 10 years to make these machines quieter.Also, if you put 10 sheets of the thinnest paper in it, it makes a garbling noise like its not quite going to make it.I do find the credit card shredder feature interesting, though I haven't tried it out.I have had this machine for less than a day and I am returning it tomorrow to find something that is quieter."
1,Very dangerous. Should be subject to a recall.,My Royal shredder also won't auto-shutoff anymore and cannot be left on because it has started all by itself and run until discovered. Seems like a very dangerous fire hazard to me.
3,"Good unit, but...","We have had this unit for about nine months and it has performed flawlessly until recently. It does a good job of rendering CD's useless and a good job on credit cards. It has never jambed and always shreds consistantly. However the dog came up to it the other day and sniffed it. I am assuming a static charge hit the electronics and the shredder started running. Since this unit was off warranty, I opened it up and found what I expected from something made in China: Lots of dull solder joints on the circuit board. Also it seems a little over engineered with a lot of components to fail for just running a motor forward and reverse. It is still usable with the switch, but the auto-start feature is gone. I will use it until it quits, and try to buy one made in the US, or at least Taiwan."
2,Royal Shredder troubles,I have purchased four of these shredders for home and small business office use. Overall they work great but with a little bit of noisy operation. Now however I find that two of the four have developed the same problem. The units will not auto shut off. My office unit started by itself on a weekend when I wasn't around. Monday morning I had a hot and smelly unit greet me. I will probably not buy one of these again!
2,for small jobs only,"I bought this shredder and after only a few months, I could only shred a sheet at a time. If I try to shred more than a sheet at a time, it either jams, overloads or jams. If you have a lot to shred this can take hours. It does shred into small pieces, but the time it takes, is not good."
1,Loud struggling motor that jams often.,"I've only had the shredder for a few days, and I'm returning it. It can only handle a few sheets at a time, the motor is very load, it seems to struggle a lot, and the paper jams up on the discharge side. Its a poor built product."
5,The life and teachings of the masters of the far east,"One of the best discussions of mans' true spiritual foundation without the usual religious viewpoints to cloud and take-up space. This is a must read for ""everyone"" even you church and religion people. You'll know if you want to read this set after reading the first volumn. They're relatively short and sweet."
2,Corny Fiction of every New Age cliche,"Typical dialog : Then i saw the monks walk across the water and some of them would disappear because they would vibrate faster. We didn't have to worry about food because it would just appear and when jesus walked into the room, his light would be brighter.There are some truths expounded here but it is nothing that a truth seeker doesn't already know too well. I would say this would be a good book for somebody in junior high or high school but for adult readers, they would be better served reading the books of jesus in India."
3,"decent movie, no real character development","Everybody is just sort of there. Lau Ching Wan's character I guess has the most explained abotu him btu I still didn't find him very interesting, I just felt sorry for him.Now the way the movie starts off is freaking awesome. There are 2 guys named Jack and Martin who work for rival gangs. After they keep f***ing with eachother they finally decide to call a meeting. Then they play a little game of chicken. Don't expect anything really exciting just really cool. Same goes for the wine drinking(breaking) scene. There is some serious action going on at the end and at the midway point but certainly nothign groundbreaking. When I go into a Johhny To film I don't expect the greatest action, I expect the greatest movie.Also Yen Shi-kwan(Once Upon a Time In China, the Master Strikes) stars in this and while I thought his character was OK, they REALLY should have had a fist fight with SOMEONE!!! Just my opinion."
5,A Better Tomorrow...WAAAAAAY BETTER!,"John Woo...John Shmoo. Any Hong Kong fan that hasn't seen this movie isn't a Hong Kong fan. This is a tale of true love, friendship and above all...broken honor. I've seen it 25 times already and I'm still not sick of it. If only I had a woman like the women these guys had. To make a long story short - get this movie. Everything about it rocks. It's better than anything John Woo has done (well...The Killer comes close). Lan Ching Wan is excellent. Leon Lai is, as always, himself. The soundtrack, which exploits different variations of Sukiyaki is beautiful. I'm surprized I'm only the 3rd reviewer for this film...and the only guy to give it 5 stars. Wake up and smell the pork buns fellas!!!"
3,A hero Never Dies,"johnny To used to be a master of melodrama, partly due to his training from the tv soap opera...but since this very film, he changed into a serious filmmaker with a thorough look at the person ""hero"", in terms of both human nature and the burden which were set on them by the world. I think To was greatly influnced by his writer-partner Wai Ka Fai on this issue. Looking foward to seeing his latest ""Running Out of Time"" and ""Mission""."
3,An interesting and at time humourous heroic tragedy,"Leon Lai is Jack, a triad big brother. Lau Ching Wan is Martin, his opposite number in the opposing triad. Both are loyal to their bosses, who betray them. Both seek revenge, and die in the process. If you like HK cinema, this is pretty good, otherwise, be prepared to burst into tears. There are some good scenes; my favourite is when Jack challenges a fortune teller whom his boss believes in."
3,"Good, not great","Good, but not great, book. Probably took author all of one week (not including travel time) to write. Good one or two night read.Worth the read... but not something I would want to re-read.Basically, author just wrote down highlights of each day of his trip and published the book. I admire him for somehow getting it published but anybody with high school writing skills could have written this book (after doing the trip of course.)"
4,A storm of ideas,"Storm Constantine is a very eclectic writer.She goes from the Cyberpunk,to classic Science Fiction,to evocative fantasy,to religious satire. This book's a bountiful!"
2,This thing sucks,"I bought this for my stepsons for Christmas of 2006. We do not have a pool, but their uncle does, so we went and used it for the first time this Summer about two weeks ago. It is already warped, and the net does not stay up. The top is peeling off as well. It is now being used as a table to put snacks on at pool parties. Terrible product for the price for sure. I plan to call the company for a refund. The paddles are nice, but that is about it. Everything else about this item is bogus. Don't waste your money. If you want one of these, [...] has one for the same price and probably MUCH better quality. I regret buying this from a company I do not know much about."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this item from a pool store only because it was on clearance for $9.99 !! yes,,, only ten dollars.... I love pool toys so it couldn't hurt... Warped quickly but that's not the rub... they show 2 people with it .... standing in the shallowest area.... it was hard to play with the table at chest level! I can't believe I didn't make that realization... In either case, it is NEVER worth the original $69.00 ... just say no!"
4,Something a bit different,"Well, I wondered when I'd come across this series again. I met the producer and some of the actors at a party at BaltiCon a few years ago. They were really interested in the SF community's input and I think they even redid one of the shows based on what we told them.This series is a lot of fun. It's refreshing because it's not a gag-a-minute type show like Red Dwarf or Hitchhiker's Guide. It depends more on characters and situations for its humor and likes to lampoon some ""sci-fi"" clichés. More Sharyn McCrumb than Douglas Adams.Good points: premise, sound effects, choice of stories. Bad points: some characters need to be more 3-dimensional."
3,Smelly Dragon,"I purchased a green and a red dragon at the same time from different vendors. While they may look a bit different in the pictures they are actually from the same mold. Both companies ripped me off with the shipping. Buyer beware. Strange thing, the red dragon was made of a more flexible, smelly plastic. Made the thing seem cheaper somehow. Perhaps it is just newly made, but I don't think so. They seem to be created by a different artist than the marvelous dinosaurs. I was hoping for more reptile detail. Cute, but not worth the cost of the shipping. The permanent flames cut down on the fantasy value, in my opinion. If your kid likes dragons this is a good addition to a collection, but there are better dragons out there."
4,"Definately Matt Good, but something is missing..","While this is a great album and all, it just seems to be lacking something. It's ever so slightly missing the ""listen to it over and over again appeal"" of his first 2 solo albums. If you were drawn to songs such as ""Truffle Pigs"", or ""The Workers Sing A Song Of Mass Production"", this may not be the album for you. You won't find that slow, lyrically intense type of song on this album. However if you are a hardcore fan, you will appreciate this album for all it's worth. It hints of the early days when he put out songs such as ""Requim for Rosemary"", and my all time favorite, ""Raygun"". All and all, this is a great modern rock-n'-roll album, and I highly recommend to the dedicated fan. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Sounds better than s***, and it goes on and on","Matthew Good, despite falling into the trap of being a celebrity who fancies himself a politician, (though he is less annoying than some) is a genius. The man cannot write a bad song, his vocal and lyrical style is just plain ruthless, and the music, though stripped down, is just as brilliant.I almost want to say that it is a shame that the American music industry has not embraced Matt Good, but I believe he wants it that way, and I also believe that it's probably better off that way. I honestly don't think America would know how to handle him.Buy every record."
1,Treasure Hunt (Special Edition),"Treasure Hunt (Special Edition); Unfortunately this dvd was not a good copy, good portion of that skipped. I was unable to watch the rest of the movie."
2,No action fra Chow Yun Fat,"My favorite Actionstar flops in this boring romantic comedywith very few highlights. SO EVERYBODT WATCH OUT ! THIS IS NOT ANACTION FILM. I know CYF can do many other things than spraying bullets all over, but this is pathetic. Even Anna and The king was better than this. 2 star for the supernatural theme."
2,HUH? WHAT?,"This movie just does not know where to go. It starts out as a gun/mob/government action movie. Then changes briefly to a family values movie. Next, a conflict of western/eastern mores and values. Then, becomes a love story with a lot of very cheesy jokes. And, increasingly, becomes a mystery, fantasy. Almost none of the characters including Chow Yun Fat maintain any kind of consistency in their behavior. Some are cruel, then kind or vice versa. Some are silly and then become very clever. Mr. Fat is all of the above. There are some nice visuals occaisionally. The major climactic scene involves a massive shootout that is totally unbelievable. By the time the romantic end arrives, I really didn't care."
5,Joey's music is all that plus he's fine too,I just got the joey lawrence cd & I am telling you that this guy can sing. He has such an amazing voice that it is even hard to tell that it his him. All of the songs are awesome on here. I listened to it over & over again. I would have to say my favorite song is nothin' my love can't fix. I remember years ago when the song came out. They played the video at the end of a blossom episode & I thought it was so great. I did purchase the tape years ago but it messed up. Now I finally got it back. If you get this cd I promise you that you won't regret it.
1,You've gotta be kidding...,"This is an absurd, tacky souvenir of those times when a cute boy such as Joey ""WHOA!"" Lawrence could record music solely going by on his looks- ah-hmm... that's right, we are STILL living in those times...! I just bet this crap will get re-issued."
5,AWESOME!!!!,If Amazon does not reissue this Cd I will go crazy! Plus I have not bought it yet so will you please reissue it so I can buy it.They won't sell it anywhere else so please reissue it!!!!
5,NOTHING JOEY'S TUNES CAN'T FIX...,"So, like everyone else here, I too was a fan of Joey's when he was on Blossom, however, my fandom started a bit before those Blossom days... like 10 or 12 years before. I remember when I was around 6 watching Gimme A Break with Nell Carter (the show where she was a maid/nanny)... Joey was there.. and there begins my first celebrity crush. After Gimme a Break was cancelled, I was heartbroken, thinking I'd never see or hear from Joey again.. then Blossom.. and this album, (I still listen to it and LOVE it at 33 years old.) You know, yes, he may have been able to gain recording access due to his looks, but there is no denying that he does have talent. If you listen to any of his other albums, they've gotten progressively better throughout his career. Anytime I'm down and can't seem to perk myself up, I can pop in this CD and Joey's music makes it better. How much of the crappy, negative stuff that we call music today can do that?"
3,Joey Lawrence is the man,"This album rules, I bought it becasue I have a gay friend named jason smith who wears the same outfit as joey on the cover. I have caught him dancing on several occasions. One time he was walking in with his high school diploma his parents and family friends were there to congratulate him. The lawrence album was blarring in the background, the smith household was jumping for joy naked. It was the most freightening experience of my life. JOEY I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!"
5,Sundays Down South : A Pastor's Stories,"Having heard sermons of Jim Chatham, I had to read his book. This book, Sundays Down South : A Pastor's Stories, closely reflects his personal delivery of folksy wisdom as a key to deeply held truths. These stories, separate and apart, could be the journal writings of many, but woven together, they touch in a special way the place inside of all of us who yearn for spiritual connectedness, peace and justice. This book rates high with me just as does the good pastor, himself. I would suggest it is great reading for a hot summer afternoon, lemonade in hand, and a cool body of water someplace in the vicinity."
4,It worked but smells,"I did not think it would work, but it did.I went from dark blond (which I got a few weeks ago and got bored off) back to my original blond, and did not even get red. The resulting color might be slightly lighter than I was before, but it looks like sun lightened hair after long vacation on the beach. So I am pretty happy.The only disadvantage is that it really smells not good as some others stated before.I used some hair products to try to get read off the smell, but it does not fade that easily. I guess one needs to live with it a few days before it really gets washed out of the hair.But definitively recommendable option if you are tight on budget and can not afford the hairdresser ;)."
2,don't speak to soon,"At first I was very happy with the results,I used it a couple of times.. and learned for the second time not to use the third step anymore...or my hair gets back to the color I had before...so after the second time my hair was a lot lighter(fr dark brown with black ends to light brown) but after a few days got darker and darker on its own and now after like a month is back where I started...didn't damage the hair to much but the smell is still there when wet."
2,STINKY!!!!!,"I had been dying my hair black for the last 2-3 years. Since I was ready for a change, I went to my local beauty supply store to see if they could recommend any products that wouldn't damage my hair or require bleaching. The girl recommended this product to remove the black dye from my hair. Let me tell you, this stuff STINKS!!! It did lighten my roots, which had no black dye on them, but the ends still remained pretty dark. On the box it recommends that for stubborn hair colors (such as black) that I may need to do it a few more times, but I just couldn't do it, the smell was horrible and it took over a month for it to fully go away. My hair smelled like rotten eggs every time I washed it. I'm aware that black dye is very hard to remove, but I really don't recommend this product....there are others out there that do the same job, but without the smell."
