1,One of the worst movies I have seen,"This movie is hilarious, Daniel Craig as a blond haired blue eyed Jew??? (and no I am not anti-Semitic) The movie has redefined tedious, by the end I was pulling for the Germans to kill everyone and end the movie. Really people, what planet are you on that you think this is a good movie?? The movie also has attempted to redefine melodramatic! I would give it zero stars but that is not an option. What a horrible movie!!I had to edit this review, so now Daniel Craig has starred in two of the worst movies I have ever seen. Have any of you seen Cowboys and Aliens? He needs to change agents now before he stars in another horrible movie. And yes at the end of that movie I was really hoping the aliens would win.Of course there are movies that are much worse but for a movie trying to be legitimate this is really horrible."
2,dull cliche',"I agree with the professional movie critics. This is not a good movie. My girlfriend and I didn't even watch it to the end. We turned it off to watch ""The Big Bang Theory"" on tv. We didn't bother to see the last 20 minutes of ""Defiance's"" tedium. We were both really really really bored. I'm glad I got this dvd used(and cheap). I will resell it. The script is mediocre(full of cliches), the brothers don't look at all alike, the photography is poor or has been marred by the use of too much computer color filtering and contrast adjusting. Even many Sy-Fy channel movies look better than this. I do think this is an important story. I just think this movie is a MAJOR DUD. There are much better war movies out there. I don't understand why Amazon critics like this. It sucks!"
4,Defiance,"A good WWII action drama telling the story of the three Bielski brothers that fought the Germans and hid hundreds of Jews in the woods in the countryside of Poland. Their own small band of resistance fighters stirred up trouble for the local commands to the point that rewards were offered for them to be turned in. They eluded the Germans through the war and helped many Jews escape the death camps. Good acting, sets, and costumes give you a real feel of the times. Good quality DVD with normal features. Decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catchValkyrie (Single-Disc Edition).CA Luster"
3,"Zwick delivers a somewhat disappointing ""Defiance""","Judging from director Edward Zwick's great track record of fine films like ""Glory"", ""The Siege"", ""Blood Diamond"" and ""The Last Samurai"", I expected to really like this film. Also the subject matter of Bielski brothers standing up to the Nazi would eliminate the myth that all Jews were passive to the Nazi's atrocities toward them. Alas I found myself looking to my watch to see when it would end which I don't usually do unless it's a Spike Lee movie!! Granted the performances by Craig and Shreiber are excellent as the brothers but too many subplots deterred my interest or attention on the main theme. Nevertheless, this film could warrant a rental but I doubt seriously I could put it up to other films dealing with the Holocaust such as ""Schindler's List"",""The Reader"" with an Oscar winning performance by Kate Winslet or ""The Pianist"". Good try but falls a little short."
1,Terrible direction and acting,Could not stand more than 20 minutes. By then I was furious. The cogs in the acting are so in your face and the direction and choice of storytelling techniques so painfully bad. Tragic to see such a good and important real story get so beaten upIt is like trying to enjoy a glass of good wine with hairs in it that you have to keep removing from your mouth.
2,No good movie!,"painful acting. The main characters seemed unattached from each other. During the bothers conflicts there were the cliche style arguments with lack of substance. To me, personally, was not a very good telling story of what could have been the ordeal of these young men. Do not recommend it."
4,"Well made, not mindless action","This is not the average WW2 movie. The story and scenery gives a good feel for how these people actually survived while escaping persecution as Jews during the Nazi occupation. The action sequences are necessary as part of the story and not ""Hollywood shoot-em up."" It is not as dark as Schindler's List"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Defiance is the real life story of the Bielski brothers, who during WWII in Belarus, saved and protected 1200 fellow Jews from the Nazis. The Bielski's never sought recognition for what they did, however the descendents of the people they saved now number in the tens of thousands. The story is truly inspiring, as for the movie, it moved very slowly and like all war stories, was much too long. You quickly see that the story repeats itself over and over again. The film starts off very strong and than just flat-lines. It's a shame, because it's a great cast and an inspiring, relatively unknown story, but it just doesn't go anywhere."
2,Need the case to my DVD movie's,"The DVD was in good shape .But the DVD did not come with a case for it only a paper sleeve. If thats how you send your DVD,s I won't be buying anymore from the salers. I would really like to return it."
2,Not as good as expected.,"After watching the movie's trailer online, I was looking forward to the movie itself. But after seeing it, I was dissapointed and felt the direction was weak and the storyline could have been better developed. The movie had much potential but, in my opinion, fell flat."
5,Must See,"This is the story that every free person must see. Even more so, it is a movie every Jew must see, to learn about the other story of Jews--the ones that fought and lived. It is a moving and well made film, telling the story of truly great men. In the face of oppression and unbelievable odds, these men made a difference!"
5,Great movie about survival.,"Great movie about human survival against the cruelty of other humans, even their own countrymen. Daniel Craig gives a first rate performance along with his other cast mates."
4,Defiance,"The too rarely told story of defying Nazis. Liev Schreiber and Daniel Craig are first rate, the action sequences strong, and the plot credible. This is not a ""Holocaust"" movie about Jews dying at the hands of the Nazis, it is about the heroism of average people who are forced to take up arms to fight against oppression."
1,bought a used dvd,"I purchased a used copy here, and it turned out very bad. The disk was scratched an froze alot. Finally i just gave up watching it all together. Very bad experience."
1,Terrible Movie,I went out with a bunch of friends to see this movie and EVERY SINGLE PERSON HATED IT. I could not wait for it to end. Not a good buy!
3,Another war movie : Slow paced movie,"I am not sure why took years to tell the story of the three Bielski brothers, who managed to save the lives of 1200 Jews during the Nazi Holocaust in World War II.I like Daniel Craig , his action , personality .but in this movie he wasn't a fit . Not much of action for him to show .Craig is sometimes strong; sometimes confused in this movie .Movie movie is based on real events and those events were truly heroic."
3,"heart is in the right place, but","this is a really clumsy movie. the way they attempt to shift back and forth between tragic moments and happy human interest moments is pretty painful. but this is a story that needs to be told, so it is still worth watching. but you will see what i mean, as soon as they start asking each other what they did before the war, and suddenly it is like an episode of Cheers, the delivery is so telegraphed and TV acted."
5,What a Moving Tale of Triumph!,"This was movie was very well put together. There were parts of it that made me laugh, parts that made me angry and parts that made me teary.But the overwhelming thing that I take from this movie is an even deeper sense of respect for Holocaust survivors. After watching this movie and seeing how these folks triumphed in the face of so many seemingly insurmountable odds you'll walk away feeling that you can do anything if you have God on your side and want it badly enough."
4,Good movie,"Two very good lead actors. Great story line. Classic struggles - survival, pursuit, family conflict, tragedy. I've watched this movie 2 or 3 times over the past years which is a sign that I like it."
5,This is the way History should be taught.,I was not aware of this noble band of people. Once again truth is more powerful than anything someone could think up in fiction. I will not forget these people and the struggle they endured. Thank you for making this film. MUST SEE
4,World War,"This is a tough movie to watch--mainly because of its realism in detail of this very true incident of WW-2. I recommend this work to any who enjoy visualizing of history as I think it does give understanding to DEFIANCE.Like Schindler's List, this movie should be watched once a year to remind us where the possiblities are for humanity inflicting horror on humanity."
4,Defiance of extermination!,"True story of a couple brothers that saved hundreds... Truly one of the scariest times to go through.. To face war at its worst... just being alive is the problem whether you were a threat or not.. in fact during this time the fact that you didn't fight back made it real easy to exterminate people by the masses.. well this groups fight was to not go easily into the night but to fight for their right to stay alive... hmm almost sounded like "" Independence Day "" there for a second..Loved it.. check it out!"
4,ACTION MOVIE,Delivered as promised and in the described condition. Didn't get a chance to see this movie in the theaters but it's a good choice if you enjoy movies based on true events with a historical military feel. It was a good saturday night selection.
4,Better than I expected,"The Bottom Line:Unfairly derided as middlebrow, this intelligent World War II film by Edward Zwick wisely eschews action for a more nuanced exploration of the rigors of leadership, the endemic nature of antisemitism in Russian cultures, and the difficulty (and importance) of survival; one of the more underrated films of 2008, Defiance is a movie worth seeing.3.5/4"
5,"Really good, under-rated movie",This was a very good story with excellent acting. This told another side of the resistance of World War II that I had never heard of.The story is very interesting and the actors did a great job portraying it.
5,Great Story,I really like to read books about the holocaust but dont like the super depressing story lines. This one had a great story of survival and triumph.
5,Fantastic factual Movie,"WOW1 The movie is factual, about brothers hunted by Nazi's during WW2, as they set about to save as many people's lives as they could. Great production based on the book."
4,"Good movie, great cast","This film is dark, gritty, and violent, and in that way does justice to the bleak struggles of the era. It's not exactly feel-good, but it's not depressing either. It ends on a note of triumph rather than despair, and what makes it a great movie to me are the relationships, the bond between the brothers and the cooperation of the entire group to keep each other safe.On a personal note, my sister and I love this film because she is a big fan of Jamie Bell and we both adore Daniel Craig, and both actors turn out excellent performances."
5,Broader View of WWI,The movie Defiance will definitely broaden your view of WWII as it shows how some Jews hid in the woods and chose to fight the Germans rather than go to concentration camps. The documentary that is part of the DVD shows actual people who lived the Defiant life. There is also a documentary that shows how the film was made and what conditions were in the forest. I recommend this movie.
3,Good flick,"I don't know the history of the people that this story is about, but it was a good movie. It could have had a little more action but worth watching. I would hope that this movie would inspire a few to read the actual history of these people and compare notes."
5,Great Movie,My husband and son and I watched this movie and we all loved it. Enough that we will be buying it. It has the human side where they let you get to know the personalities (which I like) and the exciting action parts (that my husband and son like) so it makes the film an enjoyable experience for all of us. We all think that the fact it is based on a true story makes it even better. You can watch the special feature part that shows the family talking about their fathers and pictures of some of the survivors.
2,"Great premise, no follow-up","I was intrigued with the premise of the book long before I located a copy. Reading it, I was disappointed to find that there wasn't much more to it than that. It's written as a series of vignettes, starting with early American colonists encountering the Sims, and continuing forward through time to the present day, with Sims being used as medical test-subjects. I liked that approach at first, but now I'm wondering if a novel would have worked better. None of the characters are very well fleshed out (excuse the pun), and the alternate-reality world of the sims seems disappointingly similar to our own. I'd love to see a different writer work from the same starting point - the results could be fascinating."
1,Falls apart too easily,"When you telescope it out, the mechanism is so flimsy that it can't stay extended and keeps collapsing back into it miniature state."
4,Very complete workout.,I recently had a knee replacement. My doctor suggested water therapy.This book yeilded several specific therapies to improve the flex in my knee.
5,Super Book!,"The Complete Waterpower Workout book is thorough and well illustrated to demonstate the exercises. You can do in the water what you cannot do on land. In water the pain is gone so you can obtain a full range of motion. I highly recommend this book and the two others this author has colaborated on...Healing your hips and Healing your knees. But, you'll only get out of it what you put into it. To be effective you have to schedule your time and be consistent using your muscles and paying attention to your body positions throughout. If you just wiggle your finger or an ear and not use the water pressure to intensify the move it won't do anything for you. If you enjoy exercising and follow the program you will reap many rewards following this therapist."
4,Good Book,"This is a good presentation of water exercises for both shallow and deep water. In addition to general fitness exercises, there are sections for specific activities - e.g., cycling, dancing, etc."
5,"The Complete Waterpower Workout Book: Programs for Fitness, Injury",This is a big book with lots of good information. If you like to swim you can learn many good exercises in this book.
5,Delightful,This is a delightful book. The drawings are charming; the story engaging. It emphasizes the importance of imagination and giving children's creativity free rein.
4,Statue of Liberty,"The text and especially the illustrations in this book were just what I needed to explain to my kindergarten students what it would be like to visit the Statue of Liberty. The illustrator shows an aerial view of the statue on Liberty Island, the ferry needed to reach the island, and New York City in the far background. He continues with pictures showing the construction of the statue to the impressive fire works celebration on the Fourth of July. The author explains the building of the statue as well as the purpose. If you had only one book to explain the Statue of Liberty to school age children, I would recommend using ""The Story of the Statue of Liberty"" by Betsy Maestro and illustrated by Giulio Maestro."
5,The Broadway Cast! Wow!,"Well, what can I say about Les Mis. It is by far my favorite musical, and the Origional Broadway Cast shows it off. In my opinion, Eponine has an amazing voice on the recording, and adds her own touch of style to it. Also, Fantine's voice is full and with expression, along with the other females to fit their parts. The recording is so thrilling, that you get the sense that you are really there watching the show! Well I hope I helped anyone who wants to hear Les Mis. Always follow your dreams! :o)"
2,Blergh!!,"I'll keep it simple - Colm is fabulous as always, but if you ever want to remotely have a clue about this wonderful piece of theatre, two names are essential - Michael Ball as Marius, and Philip Quast as Javert,therefore the Broadway recording is a waste of time! Michael has the ability to bring the most heartless to their knees with 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'and Philip - anyone who has ever seen this man in action knows he IS Javert, always will be. The power, the aggression, the PRESENCE. On the video or on ANY recording, the voice is enough to stun the biggest non-believers! Go for the 10th anniversary, followed by the symphonic highlights for variety in character, but again some excellent performances."
2,Definitely not the best,"Definitely not the best version of Les Mis available (that would be the 10th Anniversary Concert). Eponine is truly awful. The rest of the cast is OK; if not the best possible at least they're not the worst possible. Lindsey Stafford Smith (Fantine) is better than Randy Graff. John Curl (Valjean) is better than Garry Morris, although he also seems to sing ""Stars"" (and is definitely not right for it). It sounds a lot like Roger Allam with him in ""Confrontation"". Adam Pinter (Enjolras) is no Andy Warlow or Michael Maguire, but still stirring and powerful. Christopher Smith (Marius) is also actually not bad, although we don't get to hear ""Empty Chairs and Empty Tables"". In fact, there are a LOT of great songs missing from this very short version. I recommend saving up for one of the 2- or 3-disc versions. However, if you don't pay too much for it, you might get a pleasant if unremarkable hour of music."
2,More Emotional Eponine,"This recording is pretty horrible, but it does have Frances Ruffelle as Eponine. So what if her voice is not as pretty as Lea Salonga's? Her On My Own is much more emotional! Lea concentrates too much on making her singing ""sound pretty"". Frances doesn't care, she just sings her heart out! This may be the only reason to get the recording. Colm is better on others and the Marius is AWFUL. If you're a hard core Les Miz fan, you'll buy it just to own it."
5,BEST BROADWAY MUSICAL EVER,"I HAVE SEEN LES MIZ 6 TIMES, INCLUDING ONCE IN LONDON, AND AS RECENT AS LAST MONTH ON BROADWAY. NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS ORIGINAL CAST ALBUM. THE VOICES ARE RICH AND THE LYRICS CLEAR. THE INSTUMENTALS ARE DYNAMIC AND IT IS EASY TO FOLLOW THE WHOLE STORY LINE AND PICTURE EACH SCENE AS YOU LISTEN."
2,From a 'Les Miz' fan,"Well, I didn't really like the 'Castle on a Cloud' in this. Not to sound mean, but I think Kelly Harris's is better. It bothered me that you didn't have 'Little People' in this album. I love that song! It's so cute."
3,Ok,"The songs are good, voices are good, it was just the story that didn't appeal to me. I saw the play about 1 or 2 years ago and to tell you the truth, I almost fell asleep. It just wasn't very entertaining to me. But I do think it is better than Cats, which was just plain weird.Sorry if I irritated you Les Mis fans, not everybody likes the same thing. :(I do think you would like it, though, why not go for it? You don't have to take my word for it."
2,CD purchase,"While the CD arrived promptly, there were scratches on the CD that caused the music to skip. I tried cleaning the CD, but to no avail."
2,Eponine sounds like 'Mickie Mouse',I love Les Mis but I prefer the 10th Anniversary version where Lea Solanga plays Eponine. Frances Ruffelles voice sounded like 'Mickey Mouse'..or is it 'Minnie Mouse'. It was very squeaky and disappointing that I thought at first there was something wrong with my CD player.
3,Okay,"I didn't think this recording was that bad. Colm Wilkinson was a tad more under control of his range in this one, but the guy singing Javert sounds wrong for the part, and Frances Rufelle sounds like she's doing a Brittny Spears impression while having a seizure. She is so much better and so right on the dot for her part in the OLC, why in heaven's name did she change it?"
5,Amazing,"If you have never seen the musical, it doesn't even matter! The voices are so strong and full of emotion you get swept away into the piece. Absolutly perfect for any day!"
2,Not Even Close,"The 10th Anniversary in-concert recording of this amazing show is MUCH BETTER. It is called the ""DREAM CAST"" for a reason.Les Mis is my favorite show of all time, and I have 4 different recordings of it. The 10th Anniversary cast is by FAR the best, and this one is BY FAR the worst.Terrence Mann is wonderful, but certainly not better than Philip Quast (who plays Javert in the 10th Anniversary). The Eponine on the Broadway recording is TERRIBLE. So if you want to hear ""On My Own"" or ""A Little Fall of Rain"" performed with any beauty or integrity, don't buy this version!The 10th Anniversary cast has more of the music (almost the entire show); every single performer is a standout and fabulous- if you are a true fan of this show, or want to become one, buy that recording instead. PLEASE."
2,"Buy the full version, please","Highlights are never worth it. You will never get the little in-between songs which make a show complete, montages will be cut together badly instead of being full songs as they should be...so much is left out. This is a fantastic show and deserves to be heard in full."
3,Don't even bother to get this,"Les Miserables is an outstanding production. With so many excellent versions out there (particularly the 10th Anniversary Concert recording), you'll be missing a lot if you get only the highlights. Get any of the full recordings, so you'll have a true feel of this great show."
4,"ALMOST PERFECT CASTING , NOT COMPLETE ALBUM",This Les Mis is almost perfect . If they put in Philip Quast as Javert and put in all of the songs then it would have been musch better . Some of the cast lacks to change the New Tork accent . Colm Wilkomson is the best Valjean . Overall this CD is above average .
4,Great improvement to London Cast,"If you have only heard the London Cast Recording, this Broadway Cast recording will probably bring suprises and joy to your listening pleasure. When you listen to the London Cast, the phrasing may not always make sense, this also happens with the expression. In this recording, you will find that all those little mistakes are fixed. Not the best amongst all the Les Mis recordings but its worth listening to."
5,Truely a masterpiece!,"I first saw this play on Broadway with a church group, and I liked it so much, I bought the CD. I love this CD, and I hope to buy some more versions so I can compare. The actors did a great job on their numbers. The only problem I found with this CD is that it doesn't have all of the songs. Other than that, it's really great, and I highly recommend seeing the play."
5,Excellent!,"The site of classic songs such as On My Own, Castle on a Cloud, Master of the House, and I Dreamed a Dream, Les Miserables is one of those soundtracks thats just hard to pass up! I find myself humming or singing selections as I even glance over the list of the songs. This one's a winner!"
4,Great! Loved it all the way (sort of)!,"I love the songs! I love the musical! I love the story! I just don't exactly love all the singers! I mean I love Colm Wilkinson and Judy Kuhn, but c'mon! Francis Rufelle (I hope I spelled her name correctly) is THE WORST Eponine EVER! Why couldn't they replace her with Lea Salonga, the best singer in the entire world?! Also, the Thenadiers weren't that funny, in which I picture them to be. And is there such thing as a good Marius or Fantine? The casting people could've picked better people overall. But love the cd. ""Les Mis"" is the best! Love it."
3,Even though...,"I borrowed this from a friend and listened through it. My favorite would have to be ""On My Own."" I have to say, that even though all the tracks on this are wonderful, it doesn't stand up to The Phantom of the Opera, which I love even more."
2,Not the best cast,"The Eponine here sounds like a guy using his falsetto voice. It sounds dull. Too much vibratto, falseto and nasal. I agree with the previous reviews. She sounded like she has colds, sick or something."
1,Not quite the original,"How do I know, I have the original on vinyl. There are a lot more songs on that double disc set then there are here. So, this is the original, but not quite the original. Very disappointing."
3,The worst Eponine!,"This and all the other recordings are good. If ""On My Own"" and all other songs sung by the character Eponine are among your favorites, however, skip this (and the 1985 version) and get either the complete symphonic version or the tenth anniversary concert recording -- Kaho Shimada's 'sad' and Lea Salonga's 'dejected' interpretations (and their GREATgreat voices) are MUCH, MUCH better than shrieky Frances Ruffele's."
2,ONLY FOR FANATICS,"This was the first recording of ""Les Mis"" I ever heard and I thought it was gorgeous at first. Now, having listened to all the official English-language casts and several of the foreign language ones, this one's pretty yucky. David Byrant's Marius pales dreadfully next to that of Michael Ball's rendition, as do Randy Graff and Terrance Mann's performances. The Thernardiers were simply unfunny and Colm Wilkinson and Frances Ruffelle sound the same as they do on the London cast. The only reason I really listen to this at all anymore is to hear Judy Kuhn's delightful Cosette. Get the London version, or if you're willing to shell out a few extra bucks, buy the Complete Recording. Both are ten times better than this one."
3,Disappointing!,"My introduction to Les Miserable was through its 10th Anniversary Concert. After watching that and listening to the Complete Symphonic Recording, listening to this one (and the Original London Recording) was utter disappointment for me. Slow beat, non-stellar cast, just no excitement altogether. The one number (my favorite) that I was hoping to hear a good version of was ""On My Own,"" yet, even that (especially that, I should say) was far from my expectation. (Who cast this horrible Frances-whatever singer, anyway?)To those who want to get a Les Miserable musical recording, stick to the CSR (for completeness) and the 10th Anniversary Concert versions (for excitement and vocal quality) and ignore the two rough draft (Broadway and London) versions."
5,Love This!,"I grew up listening to this recording of Les Mis and it will always be the best version to me. My favorite character is Eponine, and I love how Frances Rufelle sings in this version. Her voice has so much power and emotion, it makes Cosette sound like a shallow bimbo.However, I just learned recently that this recording omits a lot of small snippets that are only included in the Symphonic recording. So, after a lifetime of listening to this and thinking it was complete, I feel a bit slighted."
4,It's the original Broadway recording,"There are different versions of this released through the years and by different folks. This is the original and may be desired by some for sentimental reasons. I'm not a fanatic and do not have other versions, but I do liked this original set and happy with owning it."
1,It's worth your time to listen to the full score,"I have the black box full set and I love it, but I have a friend who just can't sit and listen to three CD's worth of music and was having a hard time getting into Les Miserables. SO I thought that this CD would give him the basics and maybe want to listen to the whole thing. I listened to it and thought that it sounded poorly made. It's almost like the music and the singers are not in sync in some of the songs. The voices and the music don't sound nearly as crisp in this version as it does in the full version. I wish I could get my money back for it and make my own mixed CD!!"
5,you'll love it!,"i haven't seen this show yet, however i am absolutely obsessed with the soundtrack! susan boyle's rendition of i have a dream inspired me to purchase this cd and i was not disappointed. i like susan's version better, but this soundtrack is full of musical gems that will have you singing along in no time!"
5,One of the best musicals other than the Phantom of the Opera,"I have loved this Musical ever since my mother took me to see this in London. Everyone in it is exquisite. My favorite song is still ""Master of the House"". It's hilarious. This is also worth its weight in gold."
5,Very good CD,"This CD of Les Miserables is the only one I've ever listened to, but it's the only one I would ever need, because last October when I started listening to this soundtrack of Les Mis, I fell in love with it! Since then I have seen the show on Broadway and it was so beautiful.""On My Own"" is my favorite and ""The End of the Day"" is awesome too. So is ""Overture/Work Song"", and ""Castle on a Cloud"" brings tears to your eyes. ""One Day More"" is amazing and....Well, all the songs are wonderful.Get this CD. The music is awesome."
4,"Look down, look down...","This is the only CD of Les Miserables that I have. I have fallen in love with it so far. I look forward to seeing the show and getting the complete recording. I have seen Les Miserables in concert. Some of the performances there outstrip this recording - especially the Thernardiers: Master of the House on this recording is not as good.As for the show itself, I feel that the critisim that it reuses its themes as a bit unfair - even Puccini did that. The '80s was the last great hurrah for the Broadway musical and this is one of the cornerstones. It tries to be as in-your-face as it can about the realistic conditions of 19th century France. It does a good job of condensing a 1400 page novel into a three hour show.The music is great and the CD is a good intro to the show."
4,One of my favorite musicals!,"Before Les Miz, I thought all musicals had to be happy and upbeat like the musicals of the 50's and 60's. The first time I listened to this recording I wasn't used to its style. After a few more spins, I realized that the reason this musical is so well known is because the music is so fabulous. The performers on this recording do a magnificent job of portraying the mood of Les Miserables. Colm Wilkinson and Judy Kuhn are the best Jean Valjean and Cosette out there."
4,A GOOD QUALITY CAST RECORDING,"The reason I gave this cast recording of les miz four stars and not five, is because it does not have London's Patti LuPone(Fantine) and Michael Ball(Marius), who are better than the ones on the b'way cast. The man who plays Thenardier has a very throaty, raspy voice, which I think is good for the part. Colm Wilkinson(whom i saw in toronto last year) is great, as always. The b'way cd is better than than the london cd because: a) it is longer and more complete b)the orchestrations and lyrics are the ones currently used in productions of les miz c)the orchestrations are 5x as good!.If you can only get one cd of les miz, get this one, but if you can- get both the london and b'way cast because they are both great to listen to repeatedly. If you are a huge fan of Patti LuPone and Michael Ball, get the london cast because you will be dissapointed with the b'way cd. Whatever you do, don't get the 3 cd complete recording(the majority of the cast if horrible! )"
3,NOT 31 tracks on the 2nd disk......only 17!!,"Although this is a beautiful compilation for Les Miserables, it is NOT as advertised!!!In the description it says there are 16 songs on the first disk and 31 songs on the second disk. FALSE!! There is only 18 songs, NOT 31, on the second disk as stated in the description.PLEASE note there are other versions on Amazon for LESS MONEY with the exact same songs!!!So just beware of what you are getting......or not getting!"
5,Worth it,"This CD is really worth it. Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean was ok, but still enjoyable. Terrence Manns was FANTASTIC! I absolutely love him. The person I've heard the most complaints about is Frances Ruffele as Eponine. I must admit she wasn't my favorite when I first listened to her, but now I LOVE HER. She has just the right voice to portay Eponine. She's not supposed to have a nice voice! Overall, it's really worth it. I strongly recommend it."
1,Not by Andrew Lloyd Webber,I don't know why this CD is listed as an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical! Les Mis is NOT a musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber!
1,Not worth buying to anymore,"Get the TAC if you want your money well spent.Ruthie Henshall is a lot better than Patti Lupone.Lea Salonga is what you call an award-winning performer and actress compared to Rufelle.Michael Ball is the definitive Marius ever.If you want a collection of every recording get the OLC too. But, if you really want a starstudded version that what you call real singers. Get the TAC, rent the video too."
4,An 'okay' album,"I love Les Miserables and I have four of the cast recordings. Of the four, I would place this in my bottom two primarily because of Frances Ruffelle. No person who claims to know anything about singing can honestly say that FRances sings well. Her rough voice is hard on the ears (the excuse commonly used is that it's ""unique"" -- puhleez!), plus she can NOT articulate. She just mumbles or keeps dragging the words that any listener would wonder whether she has forgotten that in musical theater (versus pop singing), it's all the more critical to COMMUNICATE to the audience; people should be able to understand what she's singing. As for her Tony Award, as one poster has already said, she was just lucky that Lea Salonga (or Kaho Shimada) weren't around yet; otherwise, she wouldn't have even been offered the part!"
1,this [stinks],"This CD is a disgrace to all people who love Les Mis. I bought this CD and was disgusted by the voices of valjean, fantine, and eponine. I do not reccommend this CD."
2,Ummm.....,"A rather good musical, if you compare it to some of the other trash that has happened. But, I was in an amatuer revue not long ago, and part of the cast performed ""At the End of the Day"" and, I must say, sounded ten times better than this recording. This album is mostly a collection of power ballads set in the wrong time frame. If you want a good mix of newer and older, I suggest Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera."
1,To the eponine here,Could you please blow your nose first before singing your voice is too annoying.
3,Not the best,"This is NOT the best recording you can find. The 10th anniversary is better. On this Cd, Eponine would probably make a better young cosette than Eponine. The end of On My Own is really bad. She sounds like a frog. Randy Graff isn't at good as Ruthie Henshall or Pattie Lapone. Take a look at the 10th Anniversary cast. It is better."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT!!!,"Too bad, we cant describe Francese Rufelle's voice as a crystalline angelic voice. If only Lea was around 10 years ago, they would have picked Lea to perform the role of Eponine. Francese is just lucky that she was born earlier. Well, Get the TENTH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT if you want a stellar-cast recording. And get the video too."
5,Great Product,Fantastic soundtrack and great sound. The whole family loves it. I would buy this one again for myself or someone else!
1,Les Miz doesn't wear well.,"This was the first CD I ever bought, probably over a dozen years ago. I loved the show when I first saw it, but by the third time, I was bored, and I stopped listening. Yesterday, I hauled this CD set out and gave another listen. I was horrified. How could I ever have thought this crap was good? What an insult to a classic story. The melodies are dull, predictable, and constantly repeat themselves with no rhyme or reason, (they certainly are not leitmotives), the lyrics are symplistic, mundane, and corny, the performances are cloying, (especially Eponine, Fantine, and Valjean.) One long boring ballad after another. ""God on High,"" for example, is the most banal of prayers, sung melodramatically, accompanied by guitar-like arpeggios on something that sounds like a xylophone. Terrible! In fact, everything about this production is awful. Now that I recall, the thing that impressed me most about the live performance was the big turntable on the stage."
2,No good at all,I love the london and 10th but this is sad! except colm wilkinson he is O.K. But every thing else is not very good at all!
1,bad packaging,I opened the tape and noticed that there were two of the same discs. both disc 2. Since i had already mailed back the duplicate which I received in error I got disgusted. I kept disc 2 and threw the other disc 2 out. I will probably not be using amazon again.
3,There's a problem.,The problem is that this musical isn't very good! There are good songs in this musical no doubt HOWEVER on the whole this just isn't packed with enough quality music.That's why I prefer The Phantom of the Opera.
5,Le Miserables-amazing,This c.d will take your heart away. They are such beautiful songs. My favorite one is On My Own. This is a great c.d and definitly one of my favorites.
5,Les mis rules,"Les mis is the most spectacular play i've ever seen. Since i was a kid i've known the words by heart and i mean by heart. It is astonishing and the soundtrack still gives the same affect when eponine dies. Sad, rejoiceful and exciting are the three words to describe it. Ever since i hadn't heard this i didn't hear the people sing! For the family"
5,"Excellent, but...",get the 10th Anniversary recording: that has the BEST cast ver assembled for his great musical!
3,NOT a Complete Recording,"The music is excellent, I have no qualms with that. My problem is that it is not a complete recording. I guess I should look for the complete symphonic recording, but there is nothing in the description of this recording to indicate it is only the primary songs. None of the dialog and some of the smaller bits are not included. For example, none of the following significant scenes are included in this recording: Valjean's first encounter with the Bishop, Valjean lifts the cart in front of Javert, Valjean is given Javert's life at the barricade.If you just want the music, this may be a fine purchase for you. If you want the entire story, look elsewhere."
5,Story pulls you like a Constrictor...,"After getting a little bored with the specs of yet another horrid virus, I was quite pleased with this book in the series when it concerntrated it's attention elsewhere. I enjoyed this book more than most of the Star Trek books I have read and deffinatly more than the first two in the series which were also good (starting with the fourth one soon).There is much satisfaction to be found in seing a character grow in wisedom while reading and it happens here. There is also a healthy amount of humour without spoiling the story and Mr Spock wasn't dissapointing at all.I recommend you give it a look..."
4,Stirring.,"I greatly enjoyed this book despite all its shortcomings, such as bad characterization, implausable plot twists and overload on emotions. Besides, the relationship between Stiles and Romulan captive is just asking for some serios slash. The editing of the book also was not the best and makes me wonder if the author actually knows what ""leer"" means. The fact that the book is actually distinctly breathtaking promises great things with better editing and a bit more thought to the plot consistency. Too bad Carey only seems to write StarTrek novels."
4,The Best of the Double Helix bunch,"This is by far the best of the ""Double Helix"" batch of novels. Diane Carey writes a tight and good story that delves into areas of Starfleet we rarily see. And don't let the picture of Spock and McCoy on the cover fool you, this is mainly about Eric Styles and his various adventures. A very good book!"
3,"Pretty Good, Bad ending","I really enjoyed this book for the most part. I enjoyed learning about the character Eric Stiles, and the chemistry between Spock and McCoy was very well portrayed. Though I am not a super-Next Generation Fan, I do like the characters Dr. Crusher and Data, and I think the scene in the Romulan fortress was great. However, I did not particularly care for the way the author ended the book. I don't like endings where the author creates somthing out of this world and unexpected (AKA Zevon's Kung-Fu Wife) and then ends the book with the feeling that you've read too fast or something."
3,I expected better,"So far, the series has been pretty good and since this is Diane Carey I was very interested in this book. But, it was a big disappointment. It started out perfectly, with a ""Star Wars"" style action sequence that is well described and written. The story developes pretty good from that moment, up to the point when we enter the ""present"" time. From that moment on, it all falls apart. The next action sequence is one long barrage of orders, and, not being a sailor, I didn't understand at all what the heck was going on. But that's just minor. My two biggest complaints are these: 1. The plague is just a background story that is hardly discussed and is solved so quickly that I wonder why the book has such a small print. 2. The characters start off great but towards the end become pure cardboard. Spock really isn't that secretive, and McCoy isn't that senile. It's a fine novel, but yeah, it's not that good... ""Ship of the Line"" was way better."
4,The series is improving...,"I have to admit that outside of the Peter David book, this was the one book in the Double Helix series I was really looking foward to most of all. It's a return, in many ways, to much of Carey's old Trek lore in which we get new characters to know and love and see them interacting with the familiar characters that we know and love from the Trek universe. Her characterizations of everyone are well done and she really gives Eric Stiles an interesting story that's a pleasure to read. Hopefully, we'll see more of him in the future. Another point I liked is that fact that the nature and severity of the virus is increasing over the novels. I only hope the series continues to get better from here on out..."
4,Double Helix picks up the pace,"The first two books in this series had sub-plots that went nowhere -- Worf in #1, Kira in #2. Here the sub-plot becomes the main plot; the story of Eric Stiles is more interesting than yet another medical ""thriller"" when we've already seen the plague fought twice. However, as another reviewer points out, some of the substitutes Carey uses for ""He/she said"" are bizarre. And everybody leers -- Dr. Crusher leers! Somebody should have edited this one. It's a shame when a well-thought-out plot is side-tracked for the reader by distractions in the writing."
5,Ryka is the best ever,"I have purchased Ryka shoes for about 20 years. These are the only shoes I will buy. They are always a perfect fit and are made for only women. Unlike other top name brands that are made for men and then sized to fit women. In all the years I have bought Ryka I have never had one problem. They always fit perfect. Never any blisters or sore feet trying to break them in. Once you go Ryka you will never go back to expensive, poor fitting shoes."
5,Awesome running shoe,"This is at least the 6th pair of these shoes I have purchased. They are, hands down, the very best running shoe I have ever found. I am a low mileage(2-5 miles/run), and not fast (10 min/mile) runner. These shoes have the most cushion, the roomiest forefoot and the best comfort of any brand I've tried. For someone who likes good cushioning (my feet never hurt, ever, from running) and a wider forefoot (they are supremely comfortable), these are the shoes for you. Note, these shoes must run a bit small for the size; I order a size larger than my pumps. I don't like my toes to hit the front of the shoe while running. I highly recommend these shoes!"
5,Excellent!,"Awsome product, service and shipping. Product received as offerd. Looking foward to future perchases from this seller. Thanks!"
1,Waste of money,"This is bascially the same production was Ballet 101, just edited and with a few new moves. Don't waste your money. Stick with Ballet 101 to learn the basic positions."
3,Beginer's Class,"I came to this video because I'm going to be away from traditional ballet classes for a period of time and I wanted a viable alternative. It was a decent class, if someone is following their class sequence, but it is not really meant for someone who has had ballet for any length of time.The most confusing thing about the video is that sometimes the exercises are demonstrated and then preformed, and sometimes they are just preformed while she explains them. The tempo of all the exercises is slow enough to accommodate either method, and after the first viewing of the lesson the confusion is significantly less.In ballet it is not necessary to preform the most difficult steps to improve, and I intend to use this video to its fullest, but I was looking for something a little more intermediate in level."
1,kodak battery,"After a short time of using it, it stopped charging. If the camera was on the cradle, after about 5 minutes the LEDs would start flashing red. I left it plugged in directly to the camera with this battery in it overnight, did not take a charge."
3,Okay,"Look of the blender is great. Even though its pretty powerful, doesnt grind semi solid or grainy stuff easily. (MASALA'S and CHUTNEYS are tough to grind). Needed to put a lot of water to let it grind. For smoothies and other liquidy products the blender is awesome."
2,Beautiful...but thats about it.,"I too bought this for making smoothies. The angle of the blades causes too much air to be whipped into the mix. Most blends come out so frothy you have to wait several minutes to drink. Solid ingredients come out in chunks regardless of speed or time. Margaritas come out frosty but hot, (how is that even possible?) It is damn gorgeous though."
5,Great book on WWI aviation,"Very well written and thoughtful book. It presents a interesting picture of the average life of a pilot in WW I on the front lines. What I find especially interesting is Gould retired as an Air Vice Marshal and was a chief instructor for the RAF. As a result he peppers the original letters he wrote as a young pilot with insights and commentary from his later life including material from the RAF archives. This is the best book I have read on this subject for discussing why events occured as they did in the air war rather than just hyping the ""glamor"" of being a fighter pilot in that brief era."
2,Hornblower rules,Not enough about the trials of life at sea. Enjoyed the wording that my mind could see the intensity of the war.
3,The Ship,"Found it too techinical, I didn't find much of a story to it. My favorite author is still Douglas Reeman. I've read other books by Forester that I liked better, such as Hornblower series."
3,Not his best.......,I expected more from a CS Forrester novel. This is DEFINATELY not in the same league with his Hornblower or Rifleman Dodd series.
5,Very wonderful source.,"This was a useful resource and very inpormative as a refrence, a consolidated materials that made it easier for usage. it was well delivered at the right time. I highly recommend it ."
4,th egirl who cried monster,What i really liked baout this book is the detials that where carefully described by the author. When you end the chapter it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next. The one detial that i liked the most was when the author describes how the librarian Mr. Mortiman eats the live flies and the live turtle whole i couold picture the way he was eating them
2,"Haunting, good for kids imagination. Horrors Galore!","Goosebumps are well loved by children so in the sense that they expand your imagination I think they are quite helpful. Horror does not suit everyone However and for some boys and girls can cause nightmares and fears of under the bed etc. Those fears are not a lasting-a- day fear they are fears that last for years until someone soothes them and convinces them the non-existency of monsters. I had that experience too. I'm not outgoing and do not like horror stories. I had a nightmare I was trapped and a monster was chasing me. I shall remember that for a long time. Kids, if you know these stories will not effect you fine, enjoy R.L.Stines spooky tales! But Parents be cautious of what your child reads. For if she\he reads something she has a fear of or suddenly becomes a fear. She\He will not forget that for quite some time. Don't be over-cautious of what your children read but make sure you can attend them if something may harm them. Thankyou."
4,"If you tell too many monster stories, you might become one","Lucy loves monsters, and feels right at home talking about them, living with them, and bringing them home to meet her parents. Librarians and teachers - beware of invitations to student's homes for dinner! I liked this book because of the surprise ending!"
4,She's Telling the Truth...But No One Believes Her!,"Lucy likes to tell monster stories (especially to her little brother Randy to scare him). One day, she left her rollerblades at the library so she had to go back to get them. When she's there, she spots the libriarian. But something is strange about him today. Mr. Mortman (the librirarian) is changing into a monster! Lucy tells her parents, her brother, and her friend Aaron, but no one believes her. While Lucy get some proof, or will she become monster chow?"
2,Made for TV movie,If you like Lifetime movies on TV this is your cup of tea. Ok plot and acting but belongs on TV not as movie.
2,Not a must see movie,"I generally don't write reviews but that movie was too much.I found it a bit surrealist and superficial. I didn't buy the ""I'm on a cloud"" part they tried to stress for the main actress throughout the movie. Besides the movie fails to release strong emotions when they are supposed to flow and the characters have no real development or depth. You can't even call the main actress a romantic person. So when at the end the dirty cop says she is ""too romantic"" I wondered what he was talking about. Good story, though.Frankly you can get a better movie out there unless your interest is in soap-like movies."
5,Bought this for the die-hard Yankee Fan and he loves this DVD,Bought this for the die-hard Yankee Fan and he loves this DVD
5,Yankees,"My mother asked for a Yankees gift for Christmas and I came across this. She loves it, a great buy"
5,a great book,a classic book on the greatest baseball team ever. alot of interesting things here and a strong must for all yankee fans all over the world. one of those books that is fun and even better when its jewelry time in october.
3,"The Four Of Hearts - Different Publisher , Same Year","I add to the first reviewer that the 1938 hardcover I have(since about 1957) was published by Grosset & Dunlap , New York ""By arrangement with Frederick A. Stokes Co."" The quotation came from the second printed page, the first having only ""The Four Of Hearts"". My copy has the outside color red with black lettering front and on the spine."
5,A requirement for your Siouxsie collection,"""A Kiss in the Dreamhouse"" by Siouxsie and the Banshees is a great album from 1982. It took me a little time to get into the album, but it was worth it. ""A Kiss in the Dreamhouse"" offers a variety of songs and has that unique sound only Siouxsie has. If you liked their other early 80's albums, you will probably like this one.It is hard for me to say which song is my favorite, as there really are some great songs to choose from here. However, ""Slowdive"" stands out for me because it combines a lot of sound types and is very catchy. In my opinion, Siouxsie and the Banshees developed by this time a unique sound unlike other groups."
2,Is This Book Accurate?,"Like the previous reviewer, I also have some questions/concerns about Higham's accuracy. I've read at least 5 other books about Thalberg, Shearer & MGM, & several things here are new to me including allegations that the Thalberg Shearer marriage was shaky (I've always read the exact opposite previously), & that Thalberg had a tendency to scream at people when he was angry (I've previously read that his persona tended to be quite mild mannered). I'd be very interested to hear other Mayer/Thalberg/Shearer biographer's opinion of this book's accuracy. I also question the allegations that Walt Disney was a Nazi sympathizer amongst others. My 2 star rating is with the assumption that the book is factually inaccurate.To me it pretty much reads as one scandal after another..... there may be SOME truth in that!"
3,"intersting, but you'll be in need of time...","We can see through Kossuth's eyes how the Revolution progressed. If you thought you knew the backgrounds of the Hungarian revolution, read this. It is a must for anyone who wants to understand this crucial phase of Hungarian history.The book itself is nicely written, yet sometimes a bit slow, so given the fact that the word concise has nothing to do with it, you'll need some time."
1,Poorly Organized and Dull,"When I saw the title, I expected to be in for a treat. Louis Kossuth was a very interesting personality, and there really is scant information in English available. Istvan Deak missed a golden opportunity to do justice to this towering figure instead offering a jargon-filled, bone dry account of the revolution with little offered in the way of background information or context. This is not a book for the layman, while the specialist will find little new covered in the book."
3,With suspension of disbelief this is enjoyable.,"The reviews of this book resemble a reverse bell curve, with most readers really liking it or really disliking it. I'm in the middle. It was fast paced, interesting, and easy to read. It entertained, which is what I wanted from this ""thriller."" The author nicely portrayed the buildup of distrust. On the other hand, I definitely had to suspend my disbelief, starting with the first secret being revealed, and continuing on throughout the book. More drawbacks include the idea that this group of men were still living together like boys. This was a stretch, and as an investigative team they seemed like a blend of amateur secret agents suffering from a giant dose of juvenile, comic book bravado. The representation of Ober was too thin to support the plot twist involving his character. But it was pretty good and about what I expected. I give it a sold three stars."
3,The Tenth Justice,It was slow to start but finally picked up pace and interest. It was not as compelling as The First Counsel.
2,Lame,"After reading about 100 pages I was shocked to go back and read the ""reviews"" on the covers from People Magazine and Washington Post. These must be paid ""reviews"" because they are outrageous in their promotion of this poorly written and simplistic work. If this kind of drivel sells then I think I will have to think about changing careers... what an easy way to make a buck!"
1,Please tell me this childish banter stops soon.,"I'm only half way through. Somebody please tell me this guy can write a story using something other than dialog to tell it. And mindless, sophomoric dialog at that. Right now I'd settle for lines like ""Slowly she turned...."", or even ""It was a dark and stormy night"". Obviously, from the 100 plus reviews listed here, you either love it or hate. So far I hate it. Nothing but innane chatter."
1,A MAJOR THRILLER? A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I struggled to understand why this book was published. A self respecting author would have rounded up all copies of the final draft and burned them. Although the basic concept is intriguing, cardboard characters spouting wooden dialogue and enacting laughable situations for doubtful reasons is not my idea of a good time. Descriptions of unfolding action are as bad as you can possibly imagine. Upon finishing I tossed it in the trash instead of adding it to my library.Then I found the answer to my question: the only conceivable reason a publisher touched this dreck. The author was a speechwriter for Bill Clinton. (Now we know why the speeches are overlong, boring and smell of barely disguised incompetence.) Now we know.Oh. One more thing. There was a scriptish tone about this misbegotten project. If it gets made into a movie I'll have to contribute to the GOP."
4,the tenth justice,i liked the banter among the friends. also there always seemed to be a new problem around every corner. liked
5,Brilliant!,10+!!!!!!!!!! summary judgment for the tenth justice ... magnificent insight ... what sweet revenge for melzner not having gotten into the law school he most wanted to
2,Not as bad as a blow to the kidneys,"Somewhat more entertaining than most legal thrillers, but much more immature, too. Nancy Drew comparisons are apt for the first half, although the second half, which focuses on paranoia, threats, two beatings, disintegrating friendships, and a suicide, is really not the sort of thing that would have happened to Nancy. Occasional lines are rather puerile: ""Dang, I thought it was a big ol' game of Parcheezi,"" said Ben. This novel is worth a look if you can get it second-hand or mass-market paperback, if for only the novelty of dorm life combined with blackmail. I really question whether the author has a future writing this kind of thing in an ongoing way, though, and I imagine the publishers lost money on the book given its unbelievably expensive in-your-face promotional push. I'm definitely not springing for another hardback from Meltzer any time soon."
3,"Good plot, weakly written","Personally, I found the characters very weak, and whiny. The concept of 4 childhood friends living together in their mid 20's is hard enough to believe, but the childish way they treated and responded to one another was too much to swallow. The lead character Ben Addison was indecisive and immature, the suspense was the only thing that kept me awake, but it takes more than just a good plot to keep the story interesting"
3,"Any book with ""Watchmen"" references can't be all bad","I haven't read the whole book, but am inclined to agree with those who found the book to be a bit Nancy Drew-ish. However, I amcurious how many folks were hip to the ""Watchmen"" references?Anyone who pays homage to Alan Moore can't be all bad,right?"
4,A pretty good book,"I thought the book had an interesting premise and was fairly well-executed. While it definitely kept me turning the pages, I did notice right from the beginning that the writing was really not on as high a level that I expect from a book that's actually found a publisher. The words, the tone, etc., really didn't flow as I would expect--however, this is a first attempt, so I cut him some slack there.Like I said, however, I was engrossed. Furthermore, and I don't know if this is good or bad, my boyfriend liked it. He has very specific reading taste: has to hook you quickly and can't be bogged down in a lot of detail. Has to keep moving, and some action scenes are good. (He's not a big reader.)"
4,GOOD LEGAL THRILLER,"What happens when a Supreme Court law clerk, Ben Addision, unwittingly shares one of the courts' opinions with a supposed peer before that opinion is published? And what happens when Ben finds out that his ""peer"" was not what he seemed? Further, what happens when the opinion shared could have astronomical financial implication?Those who stand to benefit will do anything, including balckmail and murder, to ensure nondisclosure and their financial future.THE TENTH JUSTICE gives spine-tingling thrills as Ben, along with his friends and cohorts, walks an uneven line between ethics and a desire to survive.The writing style of this author reminds the reader of John Grisham. It has an outstanding beginning and middle, but the ending could have be stronger. Nonetheless, it is well worth reading."
2,Not worth the hype,"I bought this in an airport to read on the plane -- please don't compare it to Grisham. The dialogue is worse than running your fingernails down a blackboard. The plot is silly as well as unbelievable. The characters seem written to make you dislike them intensely. The cover illustration is nice though, and there were occassional passages where the reading was not painful."
3,The end justifies the means...,"Because of the title, I was expecting the 10th Justice to be Ben or another clerk who wrongly steered the Court for personal gain. The title was sooooo of the mark. This book is so far from a ""legal thriller"" that it's mind blowing. But it is a pretty good thriller...if you can endure the book until the end.I spend the first 3/4 of the book wondering why on earth Ben was chasing this guy. Why couldn't he just let it go?! I was screaming at him to just leave it alone!! How would anyone ever figure it out anyway? As far as ""the four friends"", none of them were loyal to anyone else, except Ober. They were all pretty selfish and self serving. And I must admit, the characters were too far undeveloped. And where was this Justice all the time? And when exactly did Lisa and Ben work?The last couple chapters of the book do make it all worth it in the end, though. I couldn't wait to figure out how all the pieces fit together...but a lot of it was still mirky."
1,The Tenth Justice,"What an incredible waste of time. This could havebeen a good story but sigh, the story lacked a writer."
2,Good Lord,"Rarely have I read a book that contained dialogue this trite or characters this shallow. While I credit the author for devising an ingenious storyline, I simply could not get past the tedious dialogue or, as one of my predecessors noted, a sheer overabundance of meaningless ""he said""s and ""she asked""s. While I can blame the author's editor for the latter error, the first lies squarely with the author. These characters, particularly the protagonist's friends, spend their lives speaking a dialect that is too clever by half, and, after the first sixty pages, simply becomes annoying. Ultimately--weak ending aside--the prepossessing, two-dimensional characters who litter this book make this first effort a disappointment. (Note to the publisher: the description of our hero's ""accidental"" slip which causes his problems is a bit misleading, since a casual reading of that entire scene speaks loudly to the contrary."
4,"juvenile dialog, but excellent plot","I'm starting to get the impression that Mr Meltzer's books (I've read two so far) are full of unmarried, 20-something males who haven't matured, as evidenced by their sophomoric, and annoying banter. Even so, this book is far better than ""The Millionaires"" in that it has an engaging, and imaginative plot. Our hero, a young court clerk, is trapped after inadvertantly disclosing a Supreme Court verdict to an insider who stood to get financial gain. Afterwards, he is subject to blackmail, and sinks lower and lower, looking desparately for a way out of his quagmire. He thinks he can outsmart the bad guy, only to find out it gets worse the more he tries. About 2/3rds of the way through the book, I was dissappointed to discover which one of his circle of friends betrayed him (thought it would be held out to the end), but this was only the beginning of a series of stunning plot twists. Read past the juvenile dialog, and enjoy this thriller."
2,Not bad for first book- Not bestseller material,"Reading this book I felt like it was ""Friends meets the Supreme Court"". I lacked any pity for the hero. I felt like he should hve been fired!! The hero had no sense of ethics. That is a bad quality in a Supreme Court clerk. Fire him!! For the first 3/4's of the book I did not see one smart decision by any of the characters.The writing style was not bad. Author needs to work on plot line and concentrate more on editing. If he keeps at it, he might make a good author some day."
2,Not Great,"I just finished this book and felt it could have been better. The premise was interesting - what happens when you say the wrong thing to the wrong person - but the dialogue, the plot development, and the ending were dissappointing. Grisham is much better at this type of book."
3,"The author needs experience, but has potential","I believe that beneath Meltzer's puerile debut as a slapstick comedy/thriller author, there is real potential. The plot and characters are sophomoric, although there are some clever one-liners. I frequently felt that I was watching a play where one actor, using the same dialogue, played all the roles. Even the nemesis, Rick, enacts a very similar being as do our heroes. Eliminate a few sexual overtones and the profanity, and this book could be a Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys mystery. However, with several sessions of good writing tutelage and gained expertise, Meltzer might just make it.The book's ending almost justifies the means. The author does know how to attain an acceptable resolution to the story."
2,Not recommended for the thinking reader,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book, but the flaws just cannot be masked.While writing a ""regular guy and his buddies fight the insidious and powerful villains"" book, Meltzer fails to let the reader connect with the main characters. Not for lack of effort though, as there is more than a little melodrama and an unecessary pull on the reader's heart-strings in an effort to make all the machinations seem somehow meaningful.Ultimately, the problem for this book is the main character's buddies themselves, who each have a particular talent, and oddly, each of them has a moment to come through with a deus ex machina resolution to a problem. This stretches the credulity of the tale beyond the point of pleasure.After reading this, I took the plunge on another Meltzer book, The Zero Game, which I found a great read. The Tenth Justice is definitely not recommended."
2,implausib le,"About the only thing plausible in this book is the sense of place. The setting is Washington, DC, where I live, and most of the locations in the book are places the author has obviously been to or researched. The dialogue, however, is implausible, as is the behavior of the characters. These characters are supposed to be smart people, but they all talk, think, and act like kids. Though funny at times, the incessant junior-high-like insults and banter was mostly annoying. And it is just impossible to believe that people would make the decisions that the characters in this book make. For a better thriller involving lawyers, spying, and a young rookie getting caught up in a conspiracy, try Grisham's The Firm. If you want a realistic legal thriller, try something by Fairstein."
1,So bad it is almost good,"I was tempted to give this book 5 stars for its utter awfulness. About midway through the book, I realized the only reason I wanted to finish was in the slim chance that every single character should die a horrible death. It takes a pure type of talent to write a book this bad -- this is the ""Huckleberry Finn"" of awfulness."
2,Scott Turrow has nothing to worry about!!!!,"I am so glad I waited for the paperback version of this book. The dialogue was juvenile and I hardly cared for any of the characters. The only redeeming quality of the book is the plot. I don't think anyone had a better premise than Meltzer, but it's apparent in this book that he needs more writing experience (especially the dialogue) or maybe it's too much TV (Melrose Place watcher, I'd bet). I will give Mr. Meltzer one more read when his next book comes out..."
2,I can't believe I actually finished it,"The way I see it, the author is probably a roommate of someone with decision making power at the publishing house. If my high school son wrote this, I might be impressed that he could put together the plotline. But, I'd tell him his dialog was too juvenile, he sounded like a ten year old. I did like the concept of the story, but I spent most of the read irritated thinking another author or even I could have done a better job."
1,Maybe Gen-Xers like this stuff...,"Meltzer's writing is immature and the story is badly constructed. If this is how the Gen-X generation speak and behave, I fear for the future. Too bad, because I was intrigued by the Supreme Court plot line. I should have waited for the movie."
4,Fun quick read.,"While Meltzer's writting clearly improved with ""The Millionaires,"" the storytelling here is at its best."
2,a waste of my brain cells,one of the worst novels i've read in a long time and i read EVERYTHING. the only reason i even finished it was i was annoyed i'd spent 7.99 on it. the four male characters all seemed like the same person with different names. the plot was lame. the writing sophmoric or possibly freshman-level in high school.they'll probably make it into a movie anyway but it's going to need a lot of work...
2,Not up to my expectations,"I was very dissapointed as I read the book. The plot is very convoluted since it hinges on a mistake made by Ben Addison - the clerk, who gives out a Supreme Court decision by mistake. Instead of admitting his error, we are taken on a wild goose chase with Ben trying to cover up his actions"
2,Plot doesn't fit with characters and dialogue,"This book was greatly puzzling. The plot is dynamite. A supreme court clerk is being blackmailed into leaking decisions before they are announced. The blackmailer is beyond clever and the plot serious and suspenseful. The main characters, Ben, his roommates and Lisa spend the greater part of the book using snappy dialogue, a very bouncy bunch, totally inappropriate This does NOT fit the serious plot. At the end of the book, some of the characters get very whiney. Personally, I think the Nancy Drew mysteries of my childhood were more mature than The Tenth Justice. I felt like the characters and dialogue belonged to one book and the plot to another. Fortunately, Mr. Meltzer is young, talented and this was his first book. I look forward to better writing in future books"
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Supreme Court clerk is blackmailed. Potentially good story about 20-somethings starting out in DC.Negatives: (1) The hero is a whiny, self-centered dope. (2) The dialogue is painfully amateurish at times. Lost count of the dozens of times, ""This is my life we're talking about,"" or ""Let's just drop it, OK?"" appeared. (3) If this is the cream of America's intellectual crop...yikes!Positives: (1) Ober and Lisa characters were well drawn and fun. (2) Author has promise; only 26 when he wrote it."
1,"Plodding, slow moving story","I found The Tenth Justice to be one of the most boring books I've read in a long time. The story seemed to drag on forever at a slow, plodding pace. The lead character is supposed to be brilliant - a clerk on the supreme court - but he's too stupid to figure out that his home might be bugged? Give me a break. At the end, there are lots of questions left unanswered, which just left me frustrated but glad the book was finally over. I would NOT recommend this book."
1,The Tenth Justice,"My fascination with legal novels over the years led meto trying Brad Meltzer's ""The Tenth Justice"".This is the stuff of ""Best Sellers""? After sloggingthrough several chapters of the prattle ofself-aggrandizing juveniles who are supposedly thebrilliant clerks of Supreme Court justices and otherbrainy yuppie-types I said to myself ""Surely thisgets better."" Wrong. How many times can we read""Don't you trust me?"" ...or ""That was stupid of me.""?I can only hope that this effort was written asMeltzer's spoof of the legal novel genre that hasgained such great popularity. If so, he has done sowith success."
1,"This is really painful. I mean, torturous.","Echoing many remarks below, POOR, REALLY POOR, PITIFUL DIALOGUE. Where is the editor-type, anyway?'Da boys are meeting to review law school yearbooks to look for the villain's picture (because they have a hunch he went to law school, and a further hunch, because he's ""really smart,"" that he went to one of the top five law schools), when their pizza arrives. According to Meltzer, 'da boys ""turned their attention to the pizza."" I laughed so hard I almost spat up mine.If getting a book out is this easy, maybe I should start over, go to law school again, and write a novel rather than take the bar. Yeah, that's the ticket.I found myself finishing this book only because I felt guilty about wasting 25 bucks on it.Want real legal suspense? Read _A Civil Action_ by Jonathan Harr. Now that's a page-turner that you'll WANT to read all the way through."
2,Amateurish...,"This book was given to me as a gift by a friend who had taken quite a bit of time to select ""the perfect read"". Thus, I felt somewhat obligated to finish the book. If it were not for that, I would have put it down after the first 30 pages. The plot seemed contrived and implausible. The characters were not very well developed, with the sole exception of the protagonist (whom I found to be naive, selfish, spoiled and self-destructively impulsive). The dialogue was at times witty, at other times downright annoying. I was especially bothered by the repeated use throughout the book, by almost all the characters, of the comeback: ""Funny!"" or ""You're so funny!"" or ""That's not funny!"" However, in all fairness to the author, while I fault him for a lack of craft, I have to compliment him on his clear and crisp use of the English language."
2,Not Believable,This book was bad to say the least. You have a supreme court law clerk who is supposed to be amongst the brightest minds in the nation falling for a trick that a ten year old would see through. The dialogue of this book is tedious and mechanical.Every step of the book I knew or had a hunch for what was going to happen next. At no time did I ever feel any kind of intrigue or suspense. Maybe it was because I could not care less what happened to any of the characters.Basic plot: Moron law clerk gets tricked into revealing a pending supreme court decision. He gets black mailed by the same guy into having to reveal even more decisions. The clerk assembles the Mickey Mouse club and tries to catch the master criminal before he has to reveal another decision.I have really limited resources to books right now. I tend to read anything I get my hands on. After this one I will have to rethink that policy
2,"Excellent Idea, Execution Needed Something","The plot held me for the first three chapters or so, but I rapidly lost interest once the initial premise had been laid out. If properly supported with character development, mood, setting, etc., I can see how the rest of the book could have been fun. Lacking these elements, however, the subsequent twists and turns sounded kind of like the bad movie that the characters often mocked. In all fairness, though, this is a first novel from a young writer. I'll give his next effort a try before I close the book on Brad Meltzer."
1,not worth the (discounted) cost,"Poorly developed, childish, churlish protagonist, a one-dimensional villain, and deus ex machina solutions to the plot twists. Probably of interest to attorneys inside the beltway for its amattering of superficial supreme court lore; hard to imagine its interest to others. The characters are unpleasant, the climax dis-satisfying...it reads like a screenplay adapted as a novel, and that is likely where it is bound."
1,"Profoundly stupid, yet vapid","This is the book John Grisham could have written in Junior High, or Scott Turrow might write after a full-frontal lobodomy. The dialog has more corn than Iowa; the plot twists are as surprising as a dishwasher manual. It is truely a ""page turner"" in the tradition of Fun with Dick and Jane."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","Brad must have an Uncle Hymie in the publishing business because he most certainly did not get published on talent! Sophmoric dialogue and plotting weigh down a promising concept.Many references in the book to ""the friends"". It is certainly as shallow as the average episode of this tv show. This book looks like a rough draft to me, a great (not a good editor) might have been able to salvage this dreck.Brad is not even the writer Grisham is. Brad do not quit your law practice just yet!"
3,"If the going gets tough; Cry baby, cry.","Despite what some others have written, I enjoyed the plot, and yes it could have been done in 200 pages. However the thing I found most irritating beyong the moronic boys club was the fact that when times got tough all the ""men?"" broke down in tears. Except for the suicide, which generated honest sadness, these guys spent more time with ""tears welling up"", ""breaking into sobs"", and hugging and consoling than I care to read in one book. C'mon guys, its OK for men to cry, but not every time things get rough and you throw or are the recipient of a tantrum."
2,An array of whiny teenagers in grown-up clothing,"What could have been an interesting story about corruption at the Supreme Court is marred from the outset by the characters' endless whining. These four guys are pathetic.Everything else in the book suffers from the dialogue, and the book is dialogue-heavy. 'Nuff said.The other BIG problem I have with the story is that although the hero beds his female co-clerk, it (1) takes him forever to do so, (2) he never does it with her again. None of the roommates have a sex life either. Unless, as I suspect, it is among themselves, which would explain the whining you'll find on every page.If you enjoy homosexual dialogue, this book's for you. If not, save the money."
2,written for the small screen/large screen/not for reading,"This is written almost in dialogue, unfortunately extremely banal dialogue. Although it purports to be a mystery, there is little or no suspense, perhaps because the characters are so shallow it's hard to care whether they live or die. I can only assume Mr. Meltzer thought it would directly to the screen-large or small-since there is no narrative or character development. Good premise; disappointing implementation."
4,Lots of fun... and nostalgia,"This book really has the feel of being a young person working in D.C.: group houses, long hours, and Armand's Pizza on Capitol Hill with its all you can eat pizza buffet.No, it's not high art, but it'll keep you turning pages."
2,Started out good,"Then he fell into a trap of overthinking. The book does do a good job of grabbing the reader and keeping them in the book, but then you get to the last 100-150 pages and the Author just falls apart by really reaching and grasping for straws to find a solution.This is my first reading of Brad Meltzer and it was not a good beginning. Lets hope it gets better with his other books."
1,"Irritating, Annoying and Unbelievable.","The idea that a Supreme Court Clerk would be so careless with his responsibility is ridiculous. To add insult to injury the author continues to permit these careless mistakes to continue throughout the book. At times, the characters show signs of brillance and then turn right around and sabotage themselves. I forced myself to finish the book hoping it would get better. It never did."
1,Sure glad I paid $0.50 at a used book sale...,"Save your time and your money; not even worth the 50 cents.The plot is random and the dialogue is painful. The development of the main character seems to consist solely of him brooding every 5 pages. I can't imagine why the characters in the book risk their live's and their career's to help him. And I surely cannot believe that his ""hot"" co-clerk decided to share a night of no-strings passion with him. I was rooting for the villain..."
2,Cardboard Characters in a Papier-Mache Plot,"Sigh! Brad Meltzer is apparently one of the hottest young things to happen to the tired genre of the legal thriller. If this, his first novel, is anything to go by there is some serious hyping going on. Even as summertime beach reading this novel doesn't make it. Cardboard cutout characters bumble their way through a papier-mache plot. It is nothing more than a lightweight attempt at writing a novel with one eye on the filmrights, ala John Grisham. Indeed, if this were a telemovie (a cinema film would be unthinkable surely) it would definitely be on at 4:30am on a Tuesday morning on the Fox network.One star for effort and another for it getting published."
1,"I waited and waited for it to get better, but all in vain.","Being an attorney myself, I picked up this book with eager anticipation. I wish now that I had been a little less impulsive. I finished the book just 4 days ago, and have already forgotten ""who dunnit"", and really don't care. I do remember that the ending was predictable. However, the most annoying aspect was the gratuitous dialogue....this book was very wordy for no apparent point. I did think that the characters had some potential, but about mid-book it became painfully apparent that the author was not interested in any true development. I believe that I will stick to Jack Higgins."
1,"""Friends"" meets ""Harriet The Spy.""","An awkwardly written, obvious, Generation X take on a thriller. The author appears to be a frustrated TV writer, law degree not withstanding, who has overdosed on all the buddy sitcoms. The book simply doesn't read true, which probably means that Meltzer will be the next John Grisham."
1,don't bother,"this book was obviously an attempt by the publisher to turn a quick buck on the heels of other legal thrillers. It is absolutely terrible. The story is implausible, formulaic, and you never care one itty-bitty bit about any of the characters. The fact that it was on a best-seller list really speaks volumes about how trade paperback readers get mediocrity thrown at them. AWFUL! if you want a good book about the Supreme Court, read the Bretheren by Woodward."
1,Predictable premis meets uninspired prose,"Although the idea of using a naive legal scholar for financial gain has been recycled time and time again, the underlying plot has promise. Unfortunately, this legal scholar turned author forgot, or never learned, how to write convincing dialog. In the end, merely an unsatisfactory glimpse into the marbled walls and wooden chambers of the highest court. Grisham has nothing to fear from this effort."
2,Awful,"I read this book because I loved ""Dead Even"" by this author and was looking forward to something as suspenseful. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, I was very disappointed by ""The Tenth Justice."" This was mostly because the characters were not believable and sounded like they came out of a bad children's book. Unless you are easily entertained, I would steer clear of this one."
1,Definitely not Grisham,"If you hoping for another Grisham, you will not find it here. People's, review is more than misleading. The author a first year law student when he wrote the book was incapable of writing with the experience of a John Grisham. Characters are weak. They come across as adolescents playing at grown up jobs. Author's understanding of the law and how it works seems to be derived from reading Grishman's books and watching network television.This book is a definite pass."
1,What a waste of time......,This book could have been much better. It grew more disappointing with every page I read. The characters are all idiots and the dialogue between them is absurd and completely unrealistic. There were also technical problems with the book that made it very hard to believe.I read some reviews on here that said this book was great. Whoever said that was either friends with the author or had the wit of a box of hammers.Don't waste your money or your time on this piece of garbage.
2,The characters suck,"I am an attorney and working on writing a novel. I have never been published and I am still in the beginning stages. Having said that, i figured that since Meltzer was published right out of law school, I'd check him out. I must say, I hope his follow up work gets better. These characters, particularly the main character Ben, are supposed to be really smart but are actually really stupid. Reading this I continued to say out loud, ""really""? I don't know if Meltzer grew up with any bit of street smarts, but his characters definitely don't have any. I was not surprised at any time while reading this book and found it a bit predictable. It also tended to drone on as I was waiting for something to happen.I will give meltzer another chance, but I will pick one of his better books, if there is one."
1,One of the worst ever,"While I read a great deal, I have never bothered writing a review before. This book was so bad, I decided to try to warn others. It is one of the most boring reads ever. The characters are uninteresting, the premise is unlikely, and the dialog is tedious and juvenile. I can't imagine 20 something ""overachievers"" acting like they do in this book. I found nothing worthwhile. I bought it, so I finished it, constantly hoping that it would become interesting. I remained disappointed. This was the second Meltzer I have read, and he is now off my list. Neither was sufficiently interesting to keep my attention."
4,Fast paced page-turner but...,"I had not burned through a book since the first time I read the Firm. I do liken Meltzer in many ways to Grisham, right down to the unbelievable and disappointing ending. I would rate the first 80% of the book a 5 star rating, but the last 20% lowers my overall marks.The great build up left the author no place to go. LIke many people I try to figure out the conspiracy (who's in on it and who's out) and project the outcome---I've been surprised many times and by many authors, but the only surprise this time was the total destructive ending. Whereas this type of ending worked fine in the Lords of Discipline (Pat Conroy), it utlimately fails in the Tenth Justice.Worth reading? On a plane or beach yes--otherwise there are better thrillers out there.Will I read more of him? Sure--I gave Grisham a second shot and A Time to Kill is still his best (if not most wordy work)."
4,A FUN AND UNDERRATED BOOK! Very Witty,"I was reluctant to read this at first due to negative reviews but I was glad I gave it a shot. The best part was that it had plenty of funny dialogue between the four roommates and the co-clerk. The ending was a bit lacking but still, for young folks trying to avoid the pretentious typical legal thriller, this book is for you."
2,Ridiculous Dialogue Spoils Nice Plot,"Meltzer has crafted an intriguing plotline in this, his first novel. However, his utter lack of any writing ability whatsoever makes this novel simply unbearable at times. The dialogue is ridiculous. I have never -- and I mean NEVER -- read a novel where the dialogue and characters were so unbelievable. The plotline could have made for a great novel, but the idiocy of the main characters ensures that the book goes nowhere. While reading, numerous times I was amazed at how little common sense any of the characters had. I mean, Ben screws up by telling something he shouldn't have, and then he goes and tells everyone about it??? Give me a break. Don't embarrass Grisham and Turow by comparing them to Brad Meltzer. At least not yet. We will see what comes of his future novels, once he learns to write"
4,A perfect beach read!,"I found The Tenth Justice to be wildly entertaining and extremely fast-paced.While the characters were not very well- developed, for once I didn't care! I took it with me to the beach and found that I couldn't put it down. A great summer book."
3,"Good plot, poor storytelling","The storyline is somewhat intriguing,but the characters are shallow and not realistic. In fact, the author depicts how stick figures might converse. The dialogue was contrived and boring; the characters are not likable; the lead character is the ultimate egocentric loser. Wait for this one on the $4.99 bargain table"
5,I'm still up...,"I am not going to wax poetic on Meltzer's work. I will just tell you that I got home tonight at midnight, picked up this book and started reading. It is currently 5:45, and I just finished...and I do nott regret staying up; in fact, I felt I had no choice. I cannot wait to start on the next...five stars."
4,Good start for a fantastic author,I actually came across this book because I was dating a guy at the time who had a friend who had an advanced copy - they knew I liked to read and sugested the book. I am now an avid Brad Meltzer fan - I go to his book signings when he is in my area and rush out to get his new releases on the day they come out. I have read all of his books and the first is still the best as far as I am concerned.Plot twists and turns around every corner. This is also a book I buy and give to everyone I know.
3,An enjoyable debut for an author with promise,"It has sadly become a rare occurence for me to be sufficiently absorbed to read a novel in one sitting. in the case of Brad Meltzer's ""The Tenth Justice"", however, I made an exception. Whilst the plot ran out of steam somewhat towards the end, ones overriding impression was that the author has managed to write a story which was not only entertaining, but also managed to include the kind of credible dialogue that is too often missing from this genre of novel. I look forward to sampling his next offering and would reccomend this book as perfect holiday reading."
4,A fun summer-read,"I couldn't put this book down. It was funny, tragic, exciting. A good novel. No, this isn't a great work of fiction that will withstand the test of time. But, who cares? I wasn't looking for Tolstoy. Have fun. Enjoy the book. Don't be so serious guys!"
4,Not at all what I was expecting...,"Not at all what I was expecting with the title. If you like Washington DC action, intrigue and suspense this is for you. One of those books you don't put down the last 200 pages."
2,Too much fill without substance,"I have read two of Brad Meltzer books which I liked very well. However, The Tenth Justice has too much fill without substance. I finally quit reading the book as it was taking too long to get to the meat of the matter."
2,Sophomoric,I could just stand to read it for the sake of finishing it. Perhaps later books by this author are more mature. My two greatest irritations were the blase treatment of a death and the fact that so much of the plot was hidden from the reader as well as the characters.
4,Fun taught thriller,Brad Meltzer keeps getting better with each book he writes. His characters always have a human touch that are easy to get involved with.
2,Stick with Grisham,"Meltzer must have some of the best ""imaginary"" friends in the world. The dialogue among the roommates is just plain awful and redundant. The book contained over 300 (out of 498 pages) pages of senseless communications b/w the 4 roomies. The main character Ben is so contradictory. He is a Clerk for the US Supreme Court (we're reminded of the incredible feat countless times throughout the book) and he does some of the most moronic things that a non-top law school graduate would never do. Although Meltzer graduated from NYU Law, this book is not top rate; unfortunately, it is more like bottom 10% in class ranking."
2,"Fast Pace, but Juvenile","The Tenth Justice was a quick thriller, that was hard to put down. The plot was great, and I enjoyed the twists and turns. However, the dialog was terrible and the language was unnecessary. It seemed as if every conversation ended in one of the characters saying ""I don't want to talk about it anymore."" Also, I got the impression that the author used four letter language because he could not come up with anything more intelligent to say."
3,Okay first novel.,"""Five votes can do anything around here."" William Brennan, Supreme Court Justice. The Supreme Court behind the scenes! Leaks, screw-ups, deception, greed, ""sneakiness,"" misuse of power among the lesser ones - the Court staff and interns. Decent first novel by a former speechwriter for President Clinton and a lawyer."
3,"ENTERTAINING, FAST PACED, GRISHAM LIKE.","NOT bad, not heavy, but good quick reading. I like some of the insight into the court and the banter between roomates was great."
5,"Exciting, and stimulation...done in a day!","I completly injoyed this book from start to finish! It really makes one think, and is fun enough to understand! GREAT BOOK!"
4,Loved the writing style but poor finishing,I loved the style of writing by Brad Meltzer. His charecters were lively. The humour was good. The thing I liked the most about this book was that it I could see the charecters in my life. But when I was imagining a thrilling ending I was dissapointed . I had to close the book feeling that the ending could have been better. But overall its a good piece of work by Melzer.
3,good beach or plane reading,"I noticed that not everyone liked this book, and I can see their points. However, if you are looking for something quick and entertaining, this fits into that category. The dialogue, though sometimes trite, keeps things moving quickly, and it is nice to have a woman character who does not need saving by the men. I liked the male characters, and found their closeness, and subsequent ""break ups"" to be very true to life. Much of this book rang of thinly disguised autobiography, but I'll still be waiting to see the author's sophomore effort."
1,stupid characters,This was my first purchase by this author ... And last.I found myself screaming at his characters because they were doing such screaming dumb things and then surprised at the outcome. I tried to pick it up and finish it several times and finally decided life was too short to be yelling at fictional characters.
5,"Book is great, but the manuscript was fun too.","And now look where Brad's gone after the book. Instead of a movie deal he winds up with thought provoking ""secrets"" in the government. Way to go man! Easy read, fun to go through again, and I've caught parts of your evening investigative shows."
3,"THE MILLIONAIRES, MARK TWO","Having read and enjoyed The Millionaires, I was looking forward to this one. The Millionaires plot concerned an intelligent guy, working in the American legal system, who gets suckered into making a wrong move, and spends the rest of the novel trying to extricate himself, with help from his brother and family. The Tenth Justice plot concerns an intelligent guy, working in the American legal system, who gets suckered into making a wrong move, and spends the rest of the novel trying to extricate himself, with help from his flatmates.I thought it was poorly constructed, and that it ran out of pace at the point where the central character decided to turn himself in. At this point, I was waiting for the Get Out of Jail Free card to be produced, but there wasn't one. In other words, he was no better off than he would have been had it done so from the word go; in fact he was worse off. Which left me feeling that he'd wasted not only his time, but mine also."
1,Don't waste your time,"Meltzer's book is about the most juvenile, poorly written and plotted thriller I have ever read. The dialogue is stiff, the plot goes beyond suspension of disbelief, and the characters lack depth or even a hint of reality. If I could give it no stars I would. How this book got any raves boggles my mind. Other than the author's personal story of writing the book (being just out of law school, etc.), there is nothing about it that recommends it. It took me over four weeks to finish it because it was most definetely not a page-turner-- I could put it down and not care what was happening."
1,Illegal Filler,"How worse can you get for a legal thriller without a single court-room scene? The plot was horrible, dialogue simple yet boring, characters and situations totally unbelieveable. Most rediculous of all are the ""reviews"" inside. This is a book that does not respect the readers at all."
1,A piece of sophomoric trash.,"I should have known from the glowing quotes from People, but Supreme Court novels are always interesting. Except this one. I did read it to the end just to see if there was <i>anything</i> at all in it to justify my $6, but there wasn't.The story idea has some merit, but once one gets past ""clerk for supreme court justice blackmailed for advance information on rulings"" there is simply nothing there. Except for some poorly written sex scenes, and endless and mindless ""roommate"" dialog undoubtedly inspired by, but nowhere near even the minimal standards of, Friends, all that is left is some ""inside"" information about the workings of the Supreme Court of the United States and some of that is wrong.Meltzer should write a book on how to make money by getting absolute drivel into print. That's about the only book with his name on it that I would buy, again."
1,More holes than a hunk of swiss cheese,"You'll spend the entire book wondering why ""He just doesn't...."" Of course if he had, all those trees wouldn't have died to make the pages of this atrocious effort."
1,Bad .... Very Bad!!,When I finished this book (and I am amazed that I did) - I came to the conclusion that it was written by a high school kid (or younger) - the content was extremely amateurish. Very disappointing book from this author and to compare him to the likes of John Grisham and Scott Turow is somewhat misleading. From the implausible storyline to the shallow and irritating characters - this book was simply too awful.
2,My advice: Wait for his next book. Hopefully it'll be better,"I want to support new novelists. I live in Washington, D.C. and particularly love to read about my adopted and beloved city. I eagerly bought this highly praised first effort and settled down to be amused and dazzled. Instead, I was bored and horrified. The writing is embarrassingly poor. The dialogue is painful. The characters are unbelievable. I couldn't get past the first few chapters and skipped to the end just to learn what happened -- and found out, after reading it, that I didn't care. What WAS good about the book was the novelty of the plotline -- young Supreme Court clerk gets bamboozled and his life goes quickly south. It was new, it was different, and for that, we should be thankful"
1,Insufferable Bilge,"This review is largely intended for Tordie, whose review appears below. Jealous are we? I recently read Mein Kampf and thought that was shit too. I presume you'll be saying that I am jealous of Hitler's writing skills? Would you like it if somebody said that you enjoyed the book only because you're in love with Meltzer? I bet you wouldn't. Just how in the name of sweet Jesus do you know that us naysayers are jealous? How can you know that? Maybe we just thought that this was the most unpublishable piece of crap to come along since Absolute Power. I for one am stunned at just how bad Meltzer's book is. I didn't think there could be a lawyer book worse that Absolute Power, but I was certainly wrong.How about that cutesy-pooh little scene where we meet the cute, crazy, wacky, and funny gang? It just does not get any worse than this. Baldacci's work is Shakespeare compared to this embarrassing trash."
1,God Almighty how can it get any worse!,"ONCE AGAIN, AMAZON IS CUTTING REVIEWS IN HALF. THIS REVIEW IS A CONTINUATION OF THE ONE DIRECTLY BLEOW. Ben paused, then eventually said, ""Okay, there are four types."" Suddenly, Ober walked in the door. ""I'm home! Is the lesbo here yet?"" ""Actually, there are five types,"" Ben said.It just does not get any worse than this. Baldacci's work is Shakespeare compared to this embarrassing trash."
4,Book heading for the screen,"I don't know who owns the screen rights to this book, but it practically writes the screen play for them. The characters are attractive, interesting, and provide a peek into the high court through the eyes of the clerks. Enough red herrings to keep you guessing who the real traitor is until almost the final page. If this isn't made into a movie or tv series, somebody is missing out on the kind of entertainment mainstream america wants. I liked this book enough that I will follow up on others by Brad Meltzer. A great beach book with enough substance to entertain anytime."
5,brilliant,"it is a great book. the characters are well developed, the dialoge is brilliant and the plot is a rocks. A true page turner."
4,"""Friends"" goes to the Supreme Court with Drew Carey.","Readable. Friends goes to the SupremeCourt with Drew Carey's friends along forthe ride. Reminded me of Sidney Shelton'sbook where the heroine takes the deadcanary into the witness and then is firedfrom the d.a's office, but this is still a readablebook. You want to find out how , Ben, theclerk, is going to get out of this pickle"
2,Not to happy with the seller,I was a little unhappy with the service. When i recieved the dvd it was not attached on the inside so it was moving around inside the case and when i opened it the dvd was pretty scratched up. I tried to contact the seller about it and i have never recieved a response.
5,great movie,this is an excellent movie for kids or adults i really enjoyed it i love demi levato's voice. i also really enjoyed raise you voice with hillary duff. if you like music you'll like this movie.
1,"Wow Disney Hits Rock Bottom With ""Camp DUMB!""","Ewwwwwww!This movie is so bad!!! The story sucks. The acting and NO GOOD. I would never pay money for this. I would not even pay $0.01 for it. They could not even give this movie away its so bad.The songs suck and that Demi Lovato girl needs to shut up. Though the movie you will think why do you even talk? As for the Jonas Brothers. What the crap is the big deal? I see nothing amazing about um! They sing like they are forcing it out! As for acting? Well boys just keep trying to sing, acting is not for you.The rest of the cast is just as forgettable as the leads. I'll still trying to forget the leads. Everyone seems like they know how bad the movie is and just give up during the movie.The songs are forgettable and nothing stands out its just hard to sit through.If you want a good Rock Musical watch The American Mall!!!!!"
2,"nope, sorry","This tried so hard to be like ""High School Musical"" and it is really lacking the heart of those films, but this is your basic Disney fair and kids will think its cute. Joe Jonas was really sexy so that justifies a viewing lol"
4,Pretty Okay Disney movie-love it for the songs,"I am glad that both Camp Rock[Extended edition] and The Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus Best of Both World Concert 3D were released at the same time and they had some deal when you buy both. I bought both. On Camp Rock, the whole story line is okay and typical, there is always those group of girls who single out a girl who is sort of different from them. The girls on there weren't that great at acting,but I really enjoyed watching it for the music and songs by the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. The other characters who sang on there were also good. I would't mind watching it again and that's what I like about most Disney movies."
3,"The movie is great, but what's with full screen only?","Even as an adult (38) and father or two boys (5 & 8) I found myself enjoying the movie. The plot obviously isn't too deep but allows you to have fun throughout the movie.Sadly the DVD version falls short in presentation. I find it a mistake to not offer a widescreen version of the film other than Blu-Ray. Seeing that there was only one option to purchase as a DVD, I had assumed that either both versions were on the disc or that it was just widescreen. It was a huge disappointment to find out that the movie is only 4x3.Long story short. I wish I had read the details better on Amazon. In the end I would have not purchased this and just let the kids continue to watch the HD version we recorded on the DVR with commercials.The movie itself is 4 stars. Unfortunately I knocked this rating down to 3 stars because of the forced 4x3 format on DVD.Disney, what are you thinking?"
5,The Kid Loved It!!,This was the second of a two part purchase to support an orphanage program and it was well appreciated by the child receiving it but.... I still do not know whatever became of the blanket -- it was a two-part related gift so...???
1,Didn't Get It,I didn't get to see the movie cause the person i bought it from never sent it to me. took my money and kept to movie. some of my friends said it was bad but i don't know.
1,Camp Rock,"I HAVE NOT RECEIVD THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE TOLD AND THE SELLER, GOTTA VOTTA. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME???????????????"
3,Good story line but acting is subpar,My daughter who is 8 years old watched this movie and really liked it especially the music. The moral of the story to be true to yourself and believe in your capabilities was good.
2,$144 for a kindle book?,It would be good for the publisher to understand that putting an outrageously high price on an electronic book that the demand will be low.Sorry about the low rating...
5,just what i wanted,This was a great purchase and so much easier to buy through Amazon than going to Walmart or Target. Packaging was perfect and came when expected.
1,Not shipped after 7 days,"I ordered this item on 11/09/2011 along with one other item. The other item has been delivered and the status on this item is ""Shipping Soon""."
2,Damaged Shipment,"The first shipment arrived with a broken piece. When this was reported to Amazon.com, a new order was placed immediately. I was impressed with the free shipping on the replacement order as well as the free shipping on the return of the damaged shipment. The second shipment arrived quickly and was intact."
2,broken,"showed up broken, so that was a waste of time. packers should have put more padding in the box, but amazon was good about the return."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the quality of this Corningware set. It was made in China and does not compare with my old Corningware that was made in the USA
2,DANGEROUS!!!,I bought one piece of this but won't buy any more. There are no handles! It's very hard to hold on to it. Hasn't anyone else noticed this problem?
5,This...is...awesome!!!!,"We borrowed this from the library and that was the first time we'd ever heard the story. Now the books are INCREDIBLE, but this video just DOES IT. Brings it to life in the most fantastic way and makes you realize just how interactive the books are!!!! Check this out!!!!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"By far one of the cutest, silliest childrens' books I have ever read! We laugh out loud every time we read it! My mom was over recently while we read it and she kept saying how it reminded her of a seinfeld episode...I have read a few others of Mo William books and this was my favorite of his work."
1,This CD is Pirate,"Vitas is amazing. But please do not buy this particular title. It is Pirate. Check out Vitas' official site for a list of licensed CD and DVDs. I don't think they allow html here so just google Vitas Official Site, but you it is vitas dot com dot ru."
1,Constant shrill fan noise,"I've been very happy with several APC units purchased in the past, but this one (BX900R) is Not Acceptable due to a constant, shrill sound from the cooling fan. The fan never goes off, so the room is filled with an annoying sound at all times.It is headed for the trash.(I have two of the older APC BX1000 units, and both are air-cooled and completely quiet.)"
3,Its ok but not great,"Bought one of these a year and a half ago.....and the experience with this unit has been mediocre at best. While it doesn't make much noise nor fail often, it does not like when I use my laser printer. It will keep power to it, but when a print job gets sent to the printer, the alarms go off on the power unit. A year later though the battery is already needing to be replaced. As far as I know, it never powered anything due to a power outage. I know there will be some drain on the battery, but this is ridiculous for what I paid for the unit. Would have expected more from APC"
2,Doesn't leave hair soft,"I gave it 2 stars because it didn't have as strong a scent as the shampoo did.My hair didn't feel that soft after leaving on for extended time, and also looked greasy hours later.( note: I did rinse it out thoroughly BTW)Bottle label reads ""leave -in"" conditioner , NOT conditioner as shown.I would recommend it to anyone with dried overstyled hair , but not normal healthy hair."
5,a little dab of goodness,"It's clear that EO products are developed through trial & error by thoughtful people, starting from gentle & mild -- but also substantial -- ingredients. They are definitely NOT the result of some corporate cosmetics laboratory process. I apply a dab of French Lavender Conditioner after showering -- don't worry, you CAN leave it in -- to condition my hair & scalp."
2,not useful for me,"I found the diagrams in this book difficult to follow, and it didn't contain some words I wanted to learn, while it did contain some I would be unlikely ever to need. Also, the signs are NOT ASL but Signed English. However, I have seen other books in this series at the bookstore, and I might buy the ones on food or school. This book, however, I didn't keep."
5,5 STARS Guaranteed!,"I have been a fan from the beginning.I agree with the fan from Gulf,Fla. This cd will hook you,especially ""Heartache"" one of my all time favorites.Every cd this band has put out is awesome, and it shocks me why they never became worldwide superstars. They have not made a cd lower than 5 stars.If you buy this one,I guarantee you will buy them all!"
3,2nd to House of Dolls,"I just received this CD 2 Days ago with House of Dolls.Both CD's have some good songs. On Discover, there are2 great songs: Desire and Wait and See. Over the Rooftops and Sweetest Thing are ok, and Kick is a simple pretty slower song.White Horse is passable. Beyond Doubt sucks. Maid of Skeris a little dark and different from the other songs, more gothic?Its a cool song. All in all though, Desire and Wait and See areexcellent catchy songs."
5,A lovely record!,"A must have album! All of Michael's songs are wonderful, as usual!!Jay's...well that's better left unsaid."
2,this book was ok,"I thought the book was good, but not as good as Jason X. The book dragged too much half way through it. I thought all the best parts were at the beginning when Jason was discovered in the lake then the book went down hill until the last three chapters. I hope the other Jason X novels and the Friday the 13th novels will be a lot better then this one. If I was a Jason fan I would skip this one. I was more SFI then Horror."
5,Second studio album from the artist that makes you think!,"This second studio album from Deborah Pardes picks up where Strange Tattoo left off, with a more polished, mature sound and more delving into Deborah's mind. Pardes was a 1999 Lilith Fair winner for San Francisco, the year the Jerry Falwell attacked the event. Well, take one ticked-off performer, one crackpot, and you get ""Falwell Enough"" the perfect answer to the whole thing.Deborah's music will enthrall you with her raw emotional blues voice and her lyrics that make you think! Catch her live if you can because she's even better in a live performance. ""Blessing or a Curse"", along with ""Strange Tattoo"" are must haves for those looking for an honest female singer-songwriter."
4,"Concept Great,... Could Be Better","The concept of watching a DVD for a technical book is great. The DVDs consist of a lecture style, with Power Point presentation and some on-screen demos. I was disappointed because it does feel as if a developer sat down in front of a video camera and did a 1 tape shoot. Still, I love this concept and would like to have seen more time taken with each lesson. But, I am a visual leaner, so I appreciate having a DVD option."
2,Could be better,"I guess you get what you pay for, it was a bit borring for me to watch the lessons. It's reminding me of my Phylosophy class in HS."
2,Not Exactly John Candy's,"A down-on-his-luck stockbroker (Bobcat Goldthwaite) unbridles his seamy side when he falls in with a unscrupulous talking Standardbred named Don (played by Don, voiced by John Candy). Despite roughshod reviews, Goldthwaite's career went on. Don, however, was never seen or heard from again (rumor has it the bay trotter joined the Witness Protection Program after seeing the box office numbers).Staci Layne Wilson"
2,better 'n drinking condensed milk,oh! we invented the cinema (I say 'We' but I mean the folks behind Dabney Coleman's world famous role in women's lib.)so the western genre doesn't apply here no: you've got two things: a talking horse and a twenty-five-thousand year-old dameby the name of Virginia Southingworth Madson. Comedy wascertainly inevitable as thispair teams up to provide many depressed humans reason tooff themselves (I mean that in the hermeneutical sense).
4,So you want a high performance team?,"Not the easiest book to get through if you're not a psychologist, it nevertheless provides interesting and useful insight for teams operating in high tempo environments. Although TADMUS was geared towards dangerous, high stakes professions, its findings are applicable to teams who do not regular face life-and-death situations. Especially useful --since so little is written on it elsewhere -- is the insight into effective team dynamics and how to train to development them. Leaders who profess or aspire to have high performance teams in any realm -- military or commercial -- should take the time to learn the lessons of the study this book describes."
3,Another Irish Tragedy,"A father who is slow to respond to his son's needs, creates a family version of the Irish Tragedy."
4,A lesson in the fun of sharing,"This book is all about sharing. Thumpity is visiting Sammy at his house, but Sammy is possessive of his toys and refuses to let Thumpity play with them. Thumpity then goes to the kitchen, leaving Sammy alone in his room. Both children quickly become bored and Sammy goes down to the kitchen, where his mother tells him that toys are the most fun when shared with a friend. Very soon, both children are happily playing and they don't want to part when it is time for Thumpity to leave.This is an excellent lesson in the value of sharing your possessions with others. The pictures are well drawn and there is a large amount of kid's clutter in the background of many of the pictures. I read it to my daughter many times when she was young and I recommend it to everyone who has a child under the age of four."
3,Not as good as the others...,"I've seen many in the Boys Briefs series, and this one wasn't as enjoyable. I liked ""Kali Ma"" very much, but the rest left me flat. The DVD I rented has no link for subtitles, so I didn't get a lot from the others. The Norwegian, Brazilian and Finnish episodes looked fine, and you could fairly well understand the situation. I've been interested in short film, but these shorts, though pretty to look at, weren't as good as others in the series. Just my opinion; subtitles would help."
2,Boys Briefs 5 - A series of Boys Briefs,"I am really not into the films that are being put out for boys Briefs. In this case. For this set of short films the first one was good. The boy was doing his usual looking at other guys in the boys locker room when I guy this kid was look at attacked him with a magic marker. Wrote al over this kids body. Well the mother found out and ended up attacking the Kid that attacked her son. I still have to finish looking at the last film but it is a few kids picking on this one kid that likes to draw and I am not sure what all else, but it seems like a good film."
1,Great performance but very poorly recorded,"I saw John Martyn (in England) on the tour during which this album was recorded, and that show was one of the greatest I have ever attended. He has changed his style constantly over the years but the sound he was into in the late 1970s was amazing and like nothing I had ever heard. He played solo, with his guitar fed through fuzz, swell and an echoplex, along with an understated drum machine. The result was a swirl of building patterns of sound with the guitar echoes providing the rhythm while he played lead lines over the top. When I saw that a live album from this tour was to be released I had to buy it. The music is great, just as I remembered. Problem is that the sound quality is flat out terrible - it sounds as though it was recorded on a cassette recorder with a faulty drive motor. The sound is so bad that I can't recommend this album despite the great songs and performance. A major disappointment."
1,DON'T BUY THIS! Totally Censored version!,"Another example of a company putting out Mexican films which they know NOTHING about. This version has multiple scenes removed. They don't do it on purpose.. sadly, they don't even know what they have. So sad... Hey Xenon, take this note down.. ""the whole point of a good DVD is to make certain the film is uncut"". Unfortunate because the uncut version is a true testament to the eroticism of 70's Mexican drama. This version if just a daytime soap oprera! So find an old VHS version and see it they way it was intended to be seen!"
5,True Crime,"Unlike other crook books, this one is a word for word transcript straight from the horses' mouths...very funny. The lives of Freddie Foreman and Tony Lambrianou became linked forever on the night of October 1967 when Reggie Kay stabbed to death villain Jack ""The Hat"" McVitie."
5,awesome,This would be one of the best pure country albums put out.I am a big George Strait fanand would recomend this cd to all country fans that love real country music.
3,Worth a Read,"In my estimation, the weakest of the Marlowe series. But hey, middling Chandler is still a whole lot better than the best of most other writers. If you like Chandler, and Marlowe, you'll enjoy it."
2,This is NOT a Good Mystery,"I really wish I could have liked this book. It was my introduction to Raymond Chandler. However this turned out to be a really boring novel. I found very little to like in the character of Philip Marlowe. The book was too confusing and too slow at points. The idea of Marlowe being asked to investigate the disappearance of a mans wife - and soon the body of her lover turns up, and then the dead body of a young woman was drowned in a lake. However in the hands of a writer like Agatha Christie (who I have very deep respect for) this could have been a mystery which I would want to read over again. Instead, I just wished to end this book and get it overwith. Since I am a somewhat forgiving reader, I might try Raymond Chandler again - except now I know to barrow his works from my local library, and not to purchase them from the bookstore."
3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I feel this book could have been better if the basic themes presented in the content were not as predictable. On the other hand if that is what Raymond Chandler was looking for, a path in which the reader can easily recognize his work, than he has accomplished that. The book does have its good points, its story line is held together throughout the novel and the dialouge is good. Yet on the other hand it seems to be the same old hard-boiled story of mistaken identity and corupt cops and therefore in my eyes very unoriginal. ""You're from the big town,"" he said. ""You think you're tough and you're wise. Don't worry we can handle you. We're a small place, but we're very compact. We don't have any political tug-of-war down here. We work on a straight line and we work fast. Don't worry about us Mister."" Said Webber to Marlowe."
4,THE HILLS OF CALIFORNIA,"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets gets a little off-track when he goes to the mountains in search of the inevitable exotic/diabolical 'missing woman' (as here, usually with a hidden past). Sure there is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the various `dames' of the piece that caught me off guard but the plot line lost energy as it gathered steam trying to get up those mountain passes. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. Still, as always with Chandler you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."
4,Raymond Chandler's style & Lady in the Lake,"""And who was in charge?"" Raymond Chandler is the one in charge and he is also perhaps one of the best known and widely read American mystery writers of this 20th century. In the novel Lady in the Lake Chandler uses the hard-boiled detective genre to expand and progress the plot of the story. The use of exploiting the evil corruption of Southern California, which includes Los Angeles and San Bernadino, and surrounding areas show how everything is not what it seems. Though he practiced in a popular genre and was once dismissed as a serious writer, his works are now receiving the attention of scholars. Chandler is now recognized as a major mid-century American novelist and as an author with a deliberate approach toward the creation of fictions that present a significant criticism of American life."
3,Suspense!!!!,The Lady in the Lake was a very mysterious and suspensfull book. The book kept me wanting to read more and more every time someone died. This book was a thriller the whole way through. The book made it seem as if you couldn't anybody. In the end I was suprised at who the murderers were.
4,tough guy detective on a mission where nothing is as it seem,"Chandler brings back our detective Philip Marlowe from ""The Big Sleep."" In this adventure is trying to solve the case of a missing wife. The case leeds our tough guy detective to the mountains where he is supposed to find the alleged corps, but insteads finds the corps of some other woman. Marlowe then must search the city harder to find clues. He uses every snitch and low life he can. When Marlowe gets closer to solving the case he shakes the witts of crooked cops and low life scum. "" Police business is a hell of a problem. It's a good deal like politics...So we have to work with what we get-and we get things like this"" Captian Webber to Marlowe, ch.27,page186."
1,Dont bother!,This saga was long winded and just droned on. Rolfe's inability to see Zoe as a young woman after she's shed her disguise is a bit far-fetched and the whole story is colored by the semi-rape love scenes. Not nearly up to the standard of her other books.
2,Not her Best,"Elizabeth Thornton writes great fiction. Obviously English-school trained where language arts are important. However, this is not one of her best. Too long, too long-winded, too detailed.Read other reviews for plot-lines as I am concerned only with writing styles. Actually, the two protagonists hardly caused a ripple in my reading hours, but I continue to look for her books as they are usually way above the rest! Sentence structure, interesting plots, mature writing style and romance without all the usual ""thoughts"" and clutter. I admire Elizabeth Thornton's style."
5,A huge achievement!,"Ms. Smith's novel is a major work of crime fiction that goes way beyond the typical genre novel. Here you'll find deep characterization, a strong sense of place, powerful narrative drive and a compelling psycho-moral drama...qualities one finds only in the very best crime novels. Moreover, her heroine is a fascinatingly complex character. ""Good Morning, Killer"" is a huge achievement for this author, a fitting follow-up to her brilliant ""North Of Montana"" published a decade ago. Kudos to the author!"
4,Something Different,"While I certainly understand why this book would not appeal to the average pulp fiction reader, I really enjoyed it because the protagonist was *not* the stereotypical female we've all come to know in the various series that are out there. In fact, I was reminded of Lorraine Page of the short-lived series by Lynda La Plante. I appreciated the fact that Ana Gray was so completely irrational during the course of this story. Isn't anyone weary of the Kinsey Millhones who have such bland, acceptable, if not loveable, faults and are as original as a piece of white paper?"
2,Wasn't impressed.,"As a rule I try to read as many authors of the crime genre as I can, whether they are new or established. This novel left me asking myself, ""why did I buy this book?"" It is rare for me to lose interest in a book or author, but this one has done just that. I must say, I was able to find a new talent that I enjoyed reading. I picked up ""Waves of Deceit"" by Marlene de Velasco and found her writing style to be quite refreshing and entertaining. She will definitely go far."
4,Another Wonderful Ana Grey Story,"I was as riveted to this, April Smith's second police/FBI suspense thriller, as I was to NORTH OF MONTANA. Although this is not quite the tight masterpiece that NORTH OF MONTANA was, it has the same elements: compelling, appealing, full-bodied, believable characters; a riveting plot; a credible experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the ""Southland,"" as well as a cross-section of the types of people who live there; and, finally, a tragic plot element ""as deep as a well and as wide as a church door""--the kind of tragedy you find in the great classics.This is a more vulnerable and flawed Ana Grey. She commits blunders of timing and judgment that had me smacking the palm of my hand to my forehead as she tries to juggle catching a serial rapist and a very difficult, intense love relationship.April Smith is a gifted, gifted writer."
3,good but flawed,"I agree with the reviewer ""samantha"". The book is a quick read, and the writing is smooth. I will read this author's next book. However, the relationship between Ana and her boyfriend Andrew is unbelievable. First, we are told that they have discussed living together, which suggests that they have at least been dating a few months, but they seem to have a total lack of understanding of each other. Andrew's character is not developed enough for the reader to figure out why he is treating Ana so badly. Ana, on the other hand, consistently behaves like a teenager -- she exhibits so little common sense or self-control in her dealings with Andrew that you doubt she could have passed FBI psychological tests. This incomprehensible relationship drives some very peculiar plot twists that untimately seem unbelievable to me. In the midst of all this, the main story of the serial rapist gets lost."
1,Jim in Atlanta,"Shockingly bad. The main character was so screwed up I could not imagine her solving the crime. How are we supposed to believe in her competence when she so clumsily and incompetently tries to cover up her own ""crime?"" Her relationship with the detective was only sketched in, and we are supposed to accept their grand passion? Perhaps worst of all, I saw the ""surprise"" resolution of the book coming about halfway through. Horrible."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I had never picked up an April Smith novel before, but was intrigued by her lead character. The book had an excellent start, then went horribly wrong. Too many crimes, too many back stories, and a brilliant lead character who turned into a completely ignorant stereo-typical female-running-from-a-killer-in-high-heels victim. My first exposure to April Smith's work, will be my last."
2,Going downhill,"I read April Smith's first book, North of Montana, and enjoyed it. This book continues with the character of FBI Special Agent Ana Grey but this one leaves a lot to be desired. I agree with the reviewers who thought her relationship with her boyfriend, Andrew was not believeable. He was cruel, a cheat and a liar and yet she falls all over him right to the end. If April Smith's intent was to make Ana a doormat, she surely succeeded. The characterization of Andrew is very poor since nothing came through that would make him in any way loveable. He was a Neanderthal and her attachment to him doesn't ring true. In addition, I though she left several plot lines from North of Montana hanging. Her relationship with Donnato was just dropped with no explanation and we don't know for sure what happened to her grandfather. The characters all through the book were wooden and the plot was a little fantastic. This was a disappointment."
2,Beware buying used.,I bought this book used. I expected to get both the violin part and the piano accompaniment but only received the piano part. I will be returning this item as it will not work for me.
2,not too helpful,"this is not the book to have for violinists preparing for a gig... this book has a couple pieces that are good, but most of them are no good."
3,Surely there's something better out there.,"Yeah, this is your basic mess kit. A little difficult to keep clean -- too many nooks and joints and lips and such. Not very sturdy. I used it and it served its purpose. Better to spend a little more money and get something less flimsy. It folds up awkwardly at first, but is fine after you get used to it. Nice and compact. There, I said something nice about it.It's average."
1,Correct model not displayed,"The mess kit for sale here is not what is shown. See Texsport's website for the correct model. What I received is the pan with the rubberized handle which doesn't seem to be that much different until you realize that it is heavier than the pan itself. Tipping is guaranteed unless you are cooking on a completely flat surface (I.e. ground).And as everyone else here has said, the kit does not package itself tight. This is especially problematic when you hear it constantly rattling in your pack.Just overall not made well.Returning this one for another model."
3,OK.,The product is lightweight. Have not cooked with it yet. Looks like it will be ok for weekend trip. The handle on my pan is not like the one shown. Has a wire handle with rubber coating.
4,Nothing in Common,"The book was a love story. As usual, a few typos. What is up with the editing?? Overall, a quick read and enjoyable."
1,boring,"I barely got through this book. It felt like it was the author's first book and she was just going through the motions. Nothing exciting about it all. I loved loved loved Dirty and Broken, so I was very disappointed with this one."
1,Pod People - author and characters.,"I seriously felt like there was a misprint when I downloaded this book. After reading ""Collide,"" ""Tempted,"" ""Broken"" and a host of other truly great Megan Hart novels, I couldn't believe this drivel had her name attached to it. Its boring, uninspired prose is NOTHING like the insightful character development or lyricism of Hart's other works. Even though she lists this title on her web page, I choose to think of it as the work of an alien invader in her computer. Skip it. Nothing to see here. Go read any of the three listed above."
4,Very Entertaining!,"I didn't know exactly what to expect when I picked up this title. I've heard bits and pieces about it from various sources but I didn't have a clear picture of what it would be like. I'm happy to say this is one of the most entertaining series I've had the pleasure to watch in a while. It has a good mix of action and comedy which had me chuckling out loud quite often. The only thing I didn't like was the opening song which was too cheesy for me, but after that it was all great. The animation is decent and the background music for the action scenes were good enough. It's only the beginning but I'm definitely looking forward to what will happen next!"
3,"OK, but has some major flaws","This show is great, don't get me wrong, but there were some things that caught me. One was the whole lesbian undertones. Now I read something that says that there is no romance, boy were they wrong. While nothing happens some girls get hit on by other girls. Also the language is actually worse in the dub than the sub! Usually it is the other way around, but this time the girls are swearing in english!The show is cute, but alot of things hold it back from being a child or pre-teen safe show. I mean there are some great things on friendship, but they can get over looked because some character starts yelling ""S#!T"". I would recommend it, but it really doesn't get it's target audience with the swearing and other content."
3,Zero woman to the rescue,"I am fan of the zero woman movies, because there is not one woman who stars in the epic more than once. Also the women that star in the series are pretty sext and tight. Acting is ok, special effects suck, but not always a bad story. Don't pay more than $7 for any of the videos"
5,This book is the best spanish novel ever written!!!!!!!!!!,"Marquez made an incredible job in showing us how life was in the 18th. century. This book shows us the ignorance of a town where the unexplicable had to be related to the ""demons.""This book is about Sierva Maria's hope to survive in a world full of corruption, abandoment, due to her experience with her parents. Her mother is a slave trader, who didn't love her; her father is a man abandoned to his fate and since he hates his wife, therefore he hates his daughter. The only companion that this poor girl has is that of the slaves. During her staying at the convent, where she was thought of being possessed by the devil, she finds true love in someone that she least expected. Now she must pay for this love."
4,Easy listening,The music on this CD is easy to listen to. I sometimes put it in my Bose as the wake-up music.
4,"sad, but outstanding quality",What can I say? this cd provides you with sad but outstanding music. Terrific ambiance
5,Brilliant and sadly neglected film,"""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" is one of my all time favourite films and I bought it the moment I saw it was on DVD. However the DVD is quite dissapointing considering it is not in widescreen (even though it doesn't really suffer from cropping) and the picture and sound quality are quite dodgy. Nevertheless it is a brilliant and powerful film that contains an excellent performance from Ben Gazzara as well as some very memorable scenes and visuals. This is surely a films that deserves a place in any true film buffs DVD collection."
4,"Nice look, but picture is a bit misleading....","I am not a Bonsai tree collector and perhaps this would be obvious to someone who has been into this art. However, I bought these pebbles for a different intended purpose and was unpleasantly surprised that they are very small. The picture is a magnification of what you get. In reality, the package I received was about 3"" x 2"" and the size of the pebbles approximately 2-3 mm or 1/8 inch or even smaller. If you have imagine the size of aquarium gravel that is fairly fine grained, you will get a sense for the overall texture that will be created.The color of the pebbles is a beautiful natural looking brown and they have a bit of smoothness and luster to them. I imagine they would look beautiful under a Bonsai tree, but you only get enough to do one plant. This seems a bit expensive to me, but this is not my hobby area and perhaps this is the going rate."
4,these are rocks,"they are ok, i havent used them tho, the bag looks a lil smaller than the one pictured but how can i compare, its only a few bucks so im not bash the seller."
2,Bonsai Decorative Pebbles,I purchased these pebbles to decorate my Bonsai Trees. I found them to be too small and did not look attractive at all. They were just too small and the price too high for these pebbles. I later purchased the medium ones and they were great. The large ones I did not try yet. I have purchased from this company and they have always come through for me on delivery being here in one day and the products being in great condition when I receive them. Overall this is a very good company. I just had a problem with the small pebbles. I wish I didn't use them and threw them away. I could have exchanged them for the medium ones I later purchased from them.
4,Dave H,"A terrific sequel to ""The Anome (aka ""The Faceless Men"") which moves the storyline along at breakneck speed. Gastel Etzwane continues his investigation into the who, and where, of the Anome, as well as finding Finnerack and iniating a war with the Roguskhoi. The ending of this story, the second book in the trilogy, is simply amazing, once again establishing Vance as a brilliant and original inditer whose eclectic verbiage raises the bar for all authors, present and future, who write in this genre!"
4,Giving the Tsar the magic bird,"It is wonderful to have such a good recording of the complete opera. I first became interested in this opera while learning about Diaghilev and the Ballet Russe. And a few years back I saw a show in London at the Barbican on Diaghilev and the Ballet Russe that had original costumes, some sets, and prelimary drawings and sketches for their productions. Some of them were for their 1914 presentation of this opera with dance by Fokine.Yes, dance! They turned the opera into a ballet-opera!Well, this disk won't show you any dance, but you can hear the wonderful music and become familiar with what was so attractive to early twentieth century musicians, painters, and dancers of the avante-guard. This thoroughly tonal opera still had much that appealed to then very modern artists.The only thing this recording could have used that would make me rate it higher is a full libretto. We are provided a helpful synopsis of the story, but I still like to follow along."
5,Fine Opera,"I enjoy this opera very much. Overall, very good quality. The tempo seems to be a bit slow at times. The singing is top notch."
5,Amazing Text,I have learned more about American History reading this book than in any History Course. The text can be grueling at certain points and it is not for the faint of heart. It is DEEP history and it must have taken a lifetime of research to compile. Good luck if you intend to read the whole thing. I have an original copy that my Great-Grand Father gave me and I am not certain how he came by the text. Does any text pick up where he left off that is of the same caliber?
3,Not bad,"As the author of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets, I found the following areas would be most helpful to consumers: how insurance companies used investigative reports to determine if they should charge a high insurance rate, how credit bureaus help collection agencies track you down, credit bureaus notify credit card companies when you are late on other bills, the importance of inquires on your credit report and how long they stay there, using the same name when you apply for credit to reduce errors on your credit report, what to do if the credit bureau does not fix the incorrect account on your credit report, why a personal statement placed in your credit is not important, how to deal with the IRS and Tax liens,how long it will take to rebuild your credit after bankruptcy, and the various ways to build your credit. Overall I give this book 3 1/3 stars."
4,Info all in one place -- very educational,"I found this book to be very useful when I was preparing to buy my first house. It explains everything about credit reporting and I picked up a lot of valuable (and interesting) tips (sprinkled liberally throughout the book are boxes containing ""Hot Tip""s). Good examples of sample credit reports help you understand how to read yours closely. Sure, a lot of this information can be found free by searching the internet, but it's handy to have it all in one place, for browsing and study."
3,like it never was before,A touching drama about a family who visits a beach resort. The father (Rune Runeberg) is suffering from mid life crisis and becomes enchanted by a young employee of the resort who later awakens emotions that the father never really explored. The resulting friendship threatens to alienate the family. This film is an enchanting and disturbing look at freespirited adolescence and male mid life crisis. Guaranteed to be enjoyed by all.
1,Whining through Alaska,The book lost me in the first seven pages of whining. It contains nothing new or unique in its information or documentation of the authors eating their way through Alaska. A complete waste of money.
4,Good for putting yourself to the test,Definately not the final solution to preparing for the exam but it did contain precise short explinations of what you were expected to know. It compliments Sybex's Study Guide very well. I would recommend to read the study guide first and then this book to compliment and to focus on the important things. Good luck to all of you taking this exam!
3,A good review book but some technical errors.,I purchased this book first and there are some technical errors in it. I would recommend the MCSE Exam Notes book if you can only afford to but one book. If you have experience in networking and can spot the errors then this book will give you a good overview for the exam. I studied using both books and received a score of 833.
4,Good for test prep not a primary text,"The test sucess book was good for test preparation. I found it much better than the Exam Cram book which is riddled with mistakes. Unless you are already in the IT field, use another book first. This is a study guide not a textbook. Sybex, New Riders, and Microsoft all have much more detailed Networking Essential Study guides for your primary text."
1,Absolutely the most frutrating of them all,I will make this short and sweet. He does NOT explain himself. the book was awful. He assumes way to much knowledge for a test that Bill Gates is recruiting taxi drivers to take. I tmade me so mad I actually threw it around and stepped on it.
1,"Spend your money the right way, then pass.","Buy MCSE Readiness Review Networking Essentials, ISBN# 073560536X (MS Press) instead of this book. The MS book has a CD-rom test engine (this one doesn't), questions more realistic to those in the exam, and more comprehensive explanations. For a few bucks more, you get a lot more preparation aids.I've slammed Sybex in some other reviews, so enough is enough. Nothing personal, though I do think they need to hire professional editors and new writers. I just think they could put out better books for better prices and really help all of us, instead of riding on their name."
4,It's a good start,"This book is very good if you have some networking experience and/or a decent understanding of LAN and WAN technologies and how they work. You should supplement this with other resources, such as Exam Cram, MCSE for Dummies (seriously!), and Microsoft Readiness Review. That was my recipe for success on this exam."
4,Learn Calligraphy,this book is a great way to start learning how to use calligraphy. Try it and see!
5,BookSmart Review,"For over fifteen years our company, BookSmart, has been the primary book supplier and consultant for the majority of independent schools in NYC and southern CT. We cannot keep Nancy's Samalin's book Loving Without Spoiling in stock. The response has been simply overwhelming. Parents and teachers have been thrilled with Samalin's practical, straight-forward approach to communicating with children. This book is fantastic and a must for parents and teachers!"
5,Excellent Book,"This is an amazing book with very useful information. I started using the techniques with my toddler and saw results instantly! The information is easy to read, with examples (a bonus for me) and is a useful tool. I highly recommend this book to parents with kids of all ages."
5,A Must Have,"Simply stated, Loving Without Spoiling, is a must for every parent's library, regardless of the child's age. In this age of competitive parenting in a world filled with saboteurs and distractions, this book is a guiding light. Keep it by your bedside, on the john in the bathroom, or wherever you are likely to pick it up to find just the answer you need at the moment you need it. Samalin's common sense, easy to digest answers to so many parenting dilemmas make this book just what the doctor ordered (since he didn't know the answers!)"
5,"If you like authentic kung fu, this movie is for you!","I'm a huge fan of the martial arts, and I always love to see the *real* stuff. In the movie you get to see how Jet Li trains, and clips from actual wushu competitions. It really gets good when they talk about the Shaolin monks, and what they can do. It's absolutely amazing!!!"
1,I thought this was suppose to be a movie.,Okay I read some reviews that said this movie was amazing ... yea right! No one said it was a documentary ... I really am unsatisfied with this movie. It was a waste of my money. Over all I hated it .. Yea Jet Li was in it and all but still I am really disappointed that I don't even want to give it a star!
4,A must for die-hard Jet Li fans.,"Bought the documentary Saturday. Have watched it at least 10 times, and it's only Monday. Devoured the Jet Li footage. Couldn't get enough of the drunken sword at the end. Very impressed with Terry Fan, too. Would have liked to have seen more of him in the film. The rest of the footage was cheesy propoganda, but the clips of JL made it worthwhile. I loved it."
4,Good Expose,"This dvd's content balances enironmental/cultural/ and martial interests in researching gong fu in China. For someone like myself who is studying Martial arts and who can only dream of visiting the Shaolin temple, a dvd like this allows for more familiarity of the temple. Many of the martial artists performing are obviously of rather high quaility. I enjoyed it, and will re-watch it."
4,The most complete guide to compostite wood construction,"This is possibly the most complete guide ever written on the subject of wood/epoxy boat construction. It was written by the leading name in epoxy, Gudgeon brothers, manufacturers of the ever popular West Systems epoxy line. You HAVE to own this book if tyou are going to work with epoxy"
1,very disappointed,"pictures were dark and old, wrong font and paper making it hard to read, i returned it. amazon is great as always!"
2,Not what I expected!,"I ordered struts and rear shocks for my 1997 Mercury Villager (both Monroe) but the rear shocks were no where near the same quality as the OEM shocks. The construction seemed to be cheaper and the weight of the new shocks lead me to believe they were cheaply built too. I was amazed to find the OEM (motorcraft) shocks were not leaking, I don't expect the replacements to last 14 years and 135,000 miles. JMO UPDATE: 10-21-2011 the Monroe 32207 on the left rear started leaking oil with only 4,000 miles and 8 months of use. I tried to get Monroe to warranty the poorly made product but had no luck. Amazon came to my rescue and gave me a complete refund....I will be replacing the defective with KYB or OEM."
2,Not so superior,"Keeping for the phone charger. But the headset is awful. Soundis fine, but earbud just will not stay in my ear. Very annoying.I have small ears, so maybe it's me. But wouldn't recommend buying w/o trying out the earbud first."
4,Church History From a Jewish Context,One People Many Tribes surveys the history of the Church from the perspective of a Jewish rooted understanding of the Bible and God's purposes with the Israel and the Church. It is a primer. It helps the reader discover both the good and bad of Church history in regard to a more Jewish contextual understanding of the Bible and the Churches relationship to Messianic Jews and the Jewish people as a whole. Most readers have been very enthused. I gave it a four star because we will soon have an updated copy with more material and references.
1,Texas Rose,"This book was not like Marie's other books. The heroine was so uptight and just really...bitchy. She was so set on not staying with him, and what bothers me in romance books is when someone doesn't even tell the other person why they can't be with them. She pushed him away, she was so rude, and sometimes I just couldn't even tolerate her. Poor Matt kept trying, and sometimes I just wanted to shake some sense into him and make him stop being so nice to her. I thought he was being so considerate and sweet and caring, but in the book everybody was telling him he needed to work on how to talk to her. I really disagreed, and felt like Rose was too spoiled to deserve him."
4,"Well written, original SF","A classic example of a specific sort of science fiction at its finest. A small, tightly-written story that comments on race, culture, history, philosophy, and religion in genuinely thoughtful ways. I especially liked the character development and how well the South in 1980 was drawn. I did think it got a little heavy-handed at the end, but hell compared to the way Star Trek handles this stuff it was light as a feather. Lots of fun!"
5,Still a great read!,"I bought this book when it came out the first time and count it among my most treasured go-to books when I want to be entertained and challenged. As someone said way up back about 10 years ago, this would be a fantastic movie."
3,Collection Of Famous People Who Happen To Be Women,Think of this book as more of a reference book than a cover-to-cover read. The book is made up of the heart-warming life stories of a collection of famous women in America. The book's index is available on Amazon where you can find all of the women who are covered in this book.
4,Leaves you hungry...,"Book only appealed to me because of the all but to brief sections on Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Madeleine Albright, because these are two very independent women I admire.The book is a tad 'slap together'and many of the questions the Senator asks are lame. There is no even flow or lay out and in some ways I think the book is like a dinner party with to many odd guests and to many choices in food. Some of the time you come away satisfied, but often one is left hungry or wondering where the rest of the story is.I recommend Lazy B : Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest by Justice O'Connor and Madam Secretary: A Memoir by Madeleine Albright former Secretary of State who is still very much admired and respected in Europe, Asia and the middle east. Each tells the story of these independent thinking women who are both excellent role models for women of all ages and of a progressive mindset."
2,not as good as expected,"sorry, but i have to go against the status-quo here. initially i really liked this album, but after about 5 listens it revealed itself to be formulaic, contrived and absolutely meaningless. while the music can be very catchy and ""hooky"" at times, the lyrics mean absolutely nothing and seem to be an afterthought put there only because the head of the band (a former music critic, no less) knows that it wouldn't sell otherwise. this is not one of those cases where the lyrics are so out-there that they could only mean something to the writer, rather i honestly believe that they mean absolutely nothing to the writer, and since he is a music critic, that is an insult to my intelligence and wallet. i guess the bottom line is that if you are in the mood for a meaningless, albeit pleasant sonic diversion, buy it. on the other hand if you seek a more engaging and lasting musical experience, then skip this one and get travis's new one or one by gomez."
4,Pleasantly suprising and wonderful CD,"This is a great great cd. I gave it only 4 stars because I've given Sting 5 stars in the past, and have to keep the barometer intact. But if you want a great pop album, with incredibly catchy tunes,..almost Queen-esque in some areas,..especially with tracks like ""To Earth With Love"", then get this album, it is well worth the purchase. ""Pathfinder"" has to be one of the best and pop songs ever written. Don't let the name hinder your decision, because if you do, you'll be missing out."
4,Don't think I'll be buying one of their T shirts......,"This disc is a winner. Got tix to see ""Dad"" with the Pretenders. Imagine my chagrin when I got to the show and discovered that they had canceled, replaced by Sandra Bernhard. Yuk. Anyway - ""Oh Jim"" is a terrific song; nice melody, good vocals. The thing I like about this CD is that the vocals aren't all over the place. The lead singer has a very good voice, and he uses it in a kind of understated way."
1,"They did a bad, bad Bowie","Once again it has happened. Every now and again, Britain produces an ""antidote"" to commercial music. Once again, the original they have chosen to rip off is David Bowie. Gay Dad happened before except they were rather better and called Suede. But did it ever occur to the record company that manufactured this tinny, trite Bowie-clone, that a group can never properly emulate him because part of his brilliance is that his music revolves around THE INDIVIDUAL. When you listen to Bowie you LISTEN TO BOWIE, you listen to an individual. That is why David Bowie is a cultural icon and Gay Dad are lining the stock clearance bins of music stores everywhere."
4,From Earth With Love,"This was recommended to me by a friend who is notoriously picky about his music, who emphatically insisted that I get this CD. It was an excellent recommendation. This group demonstrates a wide range in their songwriting, from the plaintive ""Black Ghost"" to the speeding-ticket song ""To Earth With Love,"" carrying you through the entire disc without a hitch. The last track, ""Jesus Christ"" is easily one of my favorite songs lately - prayerful, pleading, and musically very interesting. I'm not a religious man, but I can feel a certain... something about that song that I really like, on many levels. I took a star off my rating, though, because the liner notes consist of nothing but abstract color blobs. I would have liked to have had the lyrics to look at, or more band info, but I'm weird like that. The music is solid, though, so it's a good buy."
4,Oasis wishes they made this cd!,This CD is simply put a great work. My wife( who doesn't keep up with music at all) asked me who was in the cd player the other night as we were going out. As my title suggest I think Oasis wishes they wrote songs this good. OH JIM is certainly a great song as well as many others. One of the best CD's the past couple of years without question. I agree with another reviewer though there should have been lyrics and band information.
3,worthwhile,"pretty cool cd of a band that was ultra hyped when they first came out, but i guess they failed to make much of an impression on the general cd buying public. lots of great songs on this record and it deserves to be heard."
4,A great collection of songs,"Ismael Rivera is an absolute must-have for everyone who wants an introduction to the best classic salsa. This disc in particular has some great songs and some ""hits"" from the ""sonero mayor"".Don't expect good sound, it's a classic, and sounds like a classic! (a very old one)."
5,A significant and valued contribution to Buddhist Studies.,"Opening The Eye Of New Awareness was written by the Dalai Lama in 1963, four years after his escape from Tibet and the communist Chinese. Opening The Eye Of New Awareness was written for both Tibetan lay people and westerners, and provides a basic summation of Buddhist doctrines and practices as they were practiced in Tibet for more than a thousand years. Opening The Eye Of New Awareness is a very highly recommended work of Buddhist scholarship, wisdom, and compassion. This Wisdom Publications edition is enhanced with a new introduction by Professor Donald Lopez which provides valuable insight into the historical and philosophical context of His Holiness' writings."
4,A LITTLE-KNOWN WONDER,"This opera doesn't find its way to the stage very much, but I fell in love with this video version and look forward to seeing it live somewhere. The first act sets the stage with a great Pre-Raphaelite look, as Francesca and Paolo meet and begin their doomed love. The music, highly melodic in the first and final acts, is charged with drama. In between, you have the brutal scenes of war, hate, violence--with Paolo's brothers, a nasty pair, contrasting nicely with the languid beauty of the two lovers' encounters. This is truly a case where the sets and costumes create a jewel-like setting for the sensual emotions displayed in Zandonai's music."
4,Forgotten gem,A rarely performed opera. Zandonai is reminiscent of Puccini. Renata Scotto and Placido Domingo are splendid. William Lewis a standout in support.
3,disappointing production,"although this DVD has very good performances by Domingo and Scotto it is flawed by very poor filming. Yes the set and costumes are lush, but it is so dark you can't see them. I bought this in spite of it being a Pioneer production, but Iwill not make this mistake again."
4,"Works well, rolling dsiplay sucks","I have had this in my wife's Mercedes for more than a year. It works well; but, the rolling display (rock, disco, classical, etc.) is impossible for me to turn off. I have anohter JVC product that is very similar in my truck that does not have the same sort of display. Seller gets good marks for shipping, etc."
4,Very good,A very well done adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's excellent plot. High quality entertainment - recommended to those who like mysteries and also to those who just like good cinema.
4,A short Account of the History of Mathematics,"Frankly I'm a little confused, I was under the impression that I was buying a used hardcover 1960 reprint from seller Quality7. The book arrived and is in good condition, however it appears that this edition was printed in 1912 by Macmillan and Co. There is a note inside the book from ""backdoor2"" indicating that he is an Ebay and Half.com seller. Overall I'm happy with the book that I received. It is a gift for my grandson for Christmas."
5,What I needed all for these,"I need to put plugs into my ears so, they stay a long time and the shape, is soft at the tip, these slide far enough, for lasting comfort. They work great, the best I have ever felt, to my ear. Foam is what I looked for, and the shape spring to original manufacture, time and again. They block sound very well, so well that I suggest, they be used."
5,Can't sleep without them,"I'm a light sleeper and even the dog getting up in the middle of the night to drink or stretch used to wake me up. Ever since I started wearing these to sleep, I sleep soundly. Now I can't sleep without them. There is a trick to getting them to fit properly and not fall out in the middle of the night. You have to roll them up with your forefinger and thumb really well and insert them almost until the end is flush with inside part of your ear. If they are in really well, it can take a second or two to dig them out in the morning. I get about 15 - 20 good nights sleep with them before they don't compress as good as they were when new. If they keep popping out during the night, it's time for a new pair. I started writing the day of the month on the back of them with a sharpie or pen, this helps me track how long I've been using them and if I lose one, I know which one is older when opening a few pairs at a time."
5,Fantastic!,"These are soooo comfortable, way more so than the yellow cylinder ones this same company makes. The other ones we have at work, and they make my ears very sore, but these don't even feel like they are there."
4,Quiet & Comfortable,"Much quieter than the ear plugs I was previously using, but they take longer to expand in your ear. Not a problem for riding a motorcycle because by the time you've put on your helmet and got on the bike they're good to go. Comfort wise they're fine."
1,Total Crap,I just bought this thing and made 1 data cd and 2 music cd's. The rom gave me an error on the 3rd cd i made and i had to reboot my computer. Ever since I hooked up the CD-Rw it's taking windows 98 five times as long to boot. It just sits there with the splash screen for about 5 minutes while the plug and play tries to detect it. The two music CD's I made don't even play in my portable CD player but I'm not sure if it's the actual CD-r or the burner... I'm probably going to take this CD-Rw back and get a hewlett packard for 30 $ more.
4,VERY GOOD FOR THE MONEY,"I have been all over the Internet searching for cheap CD-RW'Z, but have come accross none which have and outstanding price with no lack in preformance. I have made 10 CD'Z had a problem with 1 but that is outstanding."
5,The flaws of some contemporary liberal viewpoints,"David L. Hale's The Liberal Masters is a political satire cloaked and colored in the imaginative trappings of adroitly written science fiction. When planet Tyrannia, home to the ""superior"" Liberal Tyrants, invades and enslaves America, only two people are left standing in their way. Exposing the flaws of some contemporary liberal viewpoints and perspectives, The Liberal Masters a ""socially relevant"" science fiction adventure in the tradition H.G. Wells. The Liberal Masters makes for a wry and intriguing, tongue-in-cheek read."
5,Educational and entertaining,"I have seen Gary Saderup perform in real life and his performances are always compelling. This film in was shot in a small playhouse and edited to make it something slightly more than a theatrical, one-man play. Some might find the edited-in effects distracting, but I really enjoyed it. The crossfades of veteran's pictures and war footage added context to the dialogue and in some places are quite moving. The story is told completely from Douglas MacArthur's point of view and is a strong script. I continue to be amazed at Saderup's range and his ability to switch characters on-the-fly. It's borders on comical in places, but he keeps it serious. I think history buffs will enjoy this one even though it is nothing like your normal history-channel-movie-fair."
2,No detail when it counts,"I purchased this manual because I needed some instruction on replacing the heater core. It is a HUGE job. I started the job and the instructions tell me to basically strip the interior of the car. When it really counts, the whole thing falls flat on its face. There are no photographs of the most difficult parts of the instrument panel removal, just some generic words ""remove the center console bolts"" no idea which of the 20+ screws/bolts that can be found should be removed. No photographs of any of the other difficult parts of the job, including removal of the A/C unit and the heater core. It is like they just stopped and guessed. I spent too much money on this and it falls well short of what I need."
2,Far too Dramatic,"Many would be purchasers will buy this because they own several Pat Matheny CD's. I did the same. In a nutshell Lyle is responsible for those overly excessive jam-outs and awkward moments that take away from all the Pat Matheny Group CD's I own. I put this CD on for a group of people and noticed they were all irritated and quick to argue. Yanked it and put in ""We Live Here"" and all was better."
5,Good or The Price,"All In All Not Bad Good Price.Only Problem I could Find As With Alot Of Small Feeders With This Style/Type Feeders Is My 2 Mth Old Chickens Had It Flipped Over In 5 Minutes.BUT As I Did You Can Put The Feeder In A Dog Dish,I Had Some Flip Resistant Dog Dishes On Hand Not In Use Anyway.I Dont Recommend Attaching To Coop Fence Though,(To Tempting For Racoons) Middle Of Coop Is Best Out Of Reach Out Of Mind From Coons,Other Pesky Animals/Preditors."
1,not as pictured,"apparently the feeder ""base"" is only the pie-pan portion of what's in the photo, and does not include the part that the mason jar threads into. I can only assume someone would buy the base as a replacement for a worn out one? Already wasted too much time trying to figure out why the hell I'd need the base only."
3,"For any fan of Bela Lugosi, this is a must have disk!","Bela Lugosi made both good movies (Dracula)and, what some would consider, bad movies (Bride of the Monster). I consider the movies on this disk, somewhere in between. The Devil Bat is a lot of fun to watch. It's definitely the better movie of the two. Scared to Death was Lugosi's only color film, so if for no other reason, it's worth a look. The video and sound quality for both of these movies are surprisingly good. For any fan of Bela Lugosi, this is a must have disk."
4,Allen Avenue!!!!!!,"That is actually what this film was ALLEN AVENUE, it was so good from start to finish I could not got to the restroom without nearly pissing on myself trying to get back to see what was next. I love black indy films that leave you with a smile after it's done, and this film does just that. Allen Payne is a very underrated black actor that deserves far more credit than he gets. The screenplay is awesome, I say this is the black film of the year, point blank. Get it... it's worth it!!!"
5,Great Movie!,I really enjoyed watching this movie. I would recommend this to all to watch. Allen Payne is a wonderful actor. I wish it had a part two to it. LOVE IT!
3,Great Movie,"This movie was well directed as well as scripted. It perfectly fused together ""top-notch"" actors with the depth and creativeness that only low bud get films can grab. A must-see for any ""Bostonian"" and a decent film period."
2,Horrible editing,"This book was almost unreadable it was so fraught with misspellings, lack of punctuation, and typos galore.At one point, it even refers to Dinah Lance (Black Canary) as Diane Lane.I think all they did was run a spell checker on it. I've read some other books by this publisher and they all seem to have that problem."
5,quality cards for a great price,Love these cards. 20 different designs so you get a lot of choice matching card to recipient. Very fun to send cards and notes when they are reasonably priced.
2,Can't understand why everyone likes this one so much,"Okay, what's on this album? You've got Playground Twist, but that's on Once Upon a Time, then there are three other decent songs - Placebo Effect, Regal Zone, and Icon. The rest is simply not very good. Mother/Oh Mein Papa--what is that?? The Lord's Prayer--a waste of space; might be historically interesting as it constituted the band's entire first performance (improvised) some three years previous, but at this point it comes off as mightily forced nonsense. It's quite blatant space-filling. The whole production sounds stifled, and throughout Siouxsie sounds like she is actually undergoing a ""Premature Burial"". So sue me."
3,A Rushed Production,"Granted there are some good songs on this album but as a whole this is the Banshees most uncohesive release. ""The Lord's Prayer"" is a waste of space and ""Premature Burial"" takes quite a few listens to truly appreciate. With the exception of ""Placebo Effect"" and ""Mother/Oh Mein Papa"" Join Hands didn't show a progression for the Banshees at the time (though Kaleidoscope was just around the corner). Why they never included their classic outtake ""Make Up To Break Up"" or even the genre-bending ""Love and Romance"" is a mystery. Join Hands would've benefitted immensely for it."
2,Why The Band Couldn't Continue As A Punk Group,"As an ugly hangover after 'The Scream', 'Join Hands' is somewhat of a dissapointment. Siouxsie and the Banshees try to extend their thematic aspirations, that serve only to collide and grate within the limits of the punk genre. The 14 minute rendition of 'The Lord's Prayer' is just awful and takes up half the album. The other tracks, otherwise dark and terrifying, are subject to questionable production: Siouxsie's voice is lost within a sluggish white noise haze. There are great tracks here, they are just made almost unlistenable. Christ, even the cover sleeve is horrible.Best Tracks: Placebo Effect, Playground Twist"
1,Dont hold a charge after about 6 months.,They wont hold a charge after about 6 months. I wouldnt recomend this item. their cheap but they show that they are too!
5,Great sounding cables w/easy to use plugs,I don't know where the gentleman lives to be experiencing tarnish on his plugs. I live in Southwest Florida and it's very humid down here. I have owned and used George L's cables and plugs for about seven years now without ever experiencing any problems with tarnish on my plugs. I use the gold and nickel plugs but have not used the brass plugs yet. I'm extremely happy with the transparency of sound from my guitar to my amplifier. I play Sadowsky guitars through Carr amplifiers. Great sound! These are not only great sounding cables but are very easy to use. I highly recommend them ...
1,not Pat Cooper's best,"Pat Cooper's earlier records were much funnier. In this one (YOU'RE ALWAYS YELLING), he begins what seems like it will be funny, then either loses his train of thought or abandons it by another distraction. Also, I'm not a fan of dirty-joke humor, which he dabbles with here. That doesn't take any talent, and he should be above that."
2,Mmm...,"""Not Rated?"" Well I'm rating it. It gets an 'R.'There are a lot of 'f' words both in English and Italian. I like almost all things Italian, and Cooper's 'Italian' humor is so-so, but I found the language detracted from it.If the 'f' word doesn't bother you then like I stated, it's a so-so performance, but not all that great. This DVD is worth about $5 (certainly $10 max) for the quality of humor. As for Cooper's performance style, it's not what I really like, but you may if you like loud, opinionated ranting."
2,Charming story but........,"The author's wife dropped an email to me, suggesting that I might enjoy this book. I ordered it and read through it. This is a charming story and, although I mostly confine my dragon reading to McCaffrey and a few others, the story seemed fairly original to me.The problem with this book is that the author desperately needed an editor. Misuse of words (""heard of runner beast"", ""no bases in fact""), lack of punctuation, grammatical errors all marred the story. The dialogue is repetitive and doesn't ring true. It's a shame, because without these difficulties, this would be a really good read.I can't write a novel and applaud Mr. Adams for his effort, but in future, a good proof-reader and editor may come in handy to reduce the kind of errors that ruined the suspension of reality for me."
5,Great inspirational gem,"Documentaries on spiritual masters are rare and Soul Masters the movie is not only an eye opener but inspiring and very moving. To know that such great healers exist that offer great service from the heart is testimonial to the Divine's love and compassion to humanity. These masters are indeed a Godsend. Body Space Medicine, a new breakthrough Chinese herbal medicine for the 21st century coupled with innovative massage techniques such as the fire massage can be the answer to many difficult health issues. Go see this movie, you will be awed that such alternatives are indeed available from these two miracle workers. This film is not just about healing but about the spiritual journey of these two great masters. To quote Master Guo, 'Heart touches heart, soul touches soul' This is how everyone can advance on their soul journey. Amen."
5,"if you like ""what the bleep..."" type films that explore holistic health this is a good film","This film takes the essence of healing to another level - natural, and energy based. You can palpably feel the mastery of the two doctors in this film. this is not talking heads it is real results and from MD level professional."
5,Soul Masters Dr. Guo and Dr. Sha,"Heal the soul first, and the mind and body will follow. Use the tongue to identify the blockages in the body. Use touch massage, fire massage, non-touch massage to circulate energy in the body. Heal remotely - a form of quantum medicine. Concepts and principles presented as practices portrayed as part of everyday life in China and the United States by two Master Healers. A wonderful movie.Elaine White"
5,Soul Masters has SOUL POWER,"Soul Masters documents the extraordinary journeys of Dr. and Master Zhi Gang Sha and his spiritual father, Dr. and Master Zhi Chen Guo bonded in their divine commitment to service. It is amazing to realize these two Spiritual Masters walk among us during this lifetime. You will be introduced to breakthrough techniques using Soul Power to heal. And, you will experience the presence of these two Divine Servants as they offer healing, blessings and gifts to humanity and all souls. Each time I ""see"" Soul Masters, my consciousness is expanded; I have a tremendous sense of well-being, rejuvenation and am more inspired. I encourage you to experience this great film. As a practitioner and student of Master Sha, I am privileged to witness his Spiritual acumen expand exponentially from moment to moment. As Teacher and Healer he generously shares his wisdom and knowledge with all who are open to receiving. ENJOY!!!!!"
2,"Soul Masters, Dr. Gue and Dr.Sha","I enjoyed as much as I could see and hear. About half-way through, the picture broke up and the sound went crazy. Amazon immediately replaced it, but the second DVD was also bad. I did get a little more before it broke up. I'm under the impression, now, that all the DVD's of this title are bad. I have to give Amazon credit for fast service, they paid the return postage, and decided to give me credit for the DVD instead of trying a third one. I would very much have liked to see the entire movie. These Drs. are really amazing people."
3,Decent toy - better value at babies r us,"Like the mix and move toys, found them cheaper at babies r us after I bought it"
2,this book came with several blank pages!,I'm not happy at all that this book was sent to me with over 10 pages totally blank! I will never buy from this bookstore again.
3,"Good combo, good price, but do you really need it?",This is a really good combo for this price the thing is do you need it?? If you already are an owner of a T68 like me then you would know that the earpiece comes free when you purchased it...But let me tell you if you already have one you don't need it! The only thing you probably want is the car charger. And if you really want one of those space occupiers so you cell phone can get air and you can die of heat then go ahead and buy it! But if you just want the car charger you can get alone for a smaller price than this. I thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you go with my opinion. But I also respect all of your other opinions.
2,Bad... Phone Holder different from picture,"What I got from this package is a different phone holder than the one shown on the picture...Everything else is good. However, if you choose to charge your phone with the car charger, you can talk at the same time because it makes your phone not functional..."
5,YEAH!!!BABY!!! Am I making you nostalgic ?,"Fans of 60's psychadelia and XTC get two for the price of one.Both 80's ""DUKES"" lp's on one disc.The other favourable reviews of this disc are absolutely right.This homage to the music that Andy & Co. grew up with is sooooooo dead on target it's almost frightening.A contemporary aural time capsule-a great disc."
4,These Faux-60s Tunes are No Joke!,"What could have been a throwaway collection of 60s psychodelia pastiche turn, in the hands of XTC's alter egos, into some really brilliant tunes.Collideascope presents itself as an effortless lost Lennon song, but without fanfare does him one better: an homage that outstrips its object. It combines Lennon's lyrical complexity and melodic instinct with a gem-like perfection of structure.Pale and Precious is arguably stronger both melodically and lyrically than anything The Beach Boys ever mustered.A lot of the success here is due to Andy Partridge's gifts as a songwriter of great power and range. Here he transforms what could be simple pastiche into something profoundly original.My only quibble, and probably a terribly American one, is with the ""whimsical"" Alice-and-Wonderland narrative connecting songs that don't need connecting.A small price to pay for real magic."
4,"Weird but so, so cool","I purchased this because I'm an XTC fan, and man oh man, I wish I'd gotten it earlier. It's one of the weirdest psychebeatle things I've ever listened to, but two listens and I was hooked. Some of the background noise on ""My Love Explodes"" and ""Bike Ride to the Moon"" sound a little discordant when this CD is cranked in the car, and irritate my ear a little, but they are still great songs, and ""Gold Dress"" and ""Vanishing Girl"" are fab, fab, fab. Everyone should hear this thing."
4,What XTC would have been like in the 60's,"No this isn't some throwback CD to the glorious days of 60’s psychedelic, but the masters of 80’s New Wave phase giving us their creative spin at sounding like they went back in time.The songs are full psychedelic, and I think at times the boys had their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks as they push their writing and musical talents outside of their normal stuff.From the opening track ’25 O’Clock’ to the Beatles sounding ‘The Mole From The Ministry’ Chips From The Chocolate Fireball may truly only appeal to fans of XTC, but anyone looking for something unique to wrap around their ears is in for a treat when they listen to this CD."
4,Very cool,"I already own an XTC album called Venus I think. Although it sounds cool, it has nothing on the DOS. If you listen to all music, it has its derivative roots (ie it can be misconstrued as imitation, when it's simply ""influenced by"") Point: i like this better than the XTC music I have heard thus far... One of the tunes sounds like it could have been on any of the Hollies psychedelic era albums, Evolution, King Midas in Reverse, or Butterfly. If you like early Pink Floyd w. Syd and the 2nd record Saucerful of Secrets and the aforementioned Hollies, or dig the Nuggets series, pick this up. A reminder that Psych music was (and is) alive and well."
3,"Great fun. ""XTC Lite"" Sounds great, less filling.","Three and a half stars, really. This was a romp for the XTC boys, a bit of fun, a bit of a joke, with fabulous songs that both pay homage to and poke fun at the psychedelic pop era.But this is not serious enough, it doesn't have the lasting value to merit the five stars that many overenthusiastic reviewers have given.Don't let me discourage XTC fans and fans of pop in general from buying this CD. It is better than 97% of what is released into the marketplace. Still, you can't honestly put this on a level with XTC's Oranges and Lemons, a true five-star effort."
2,A curiosity that will likely sit on the shelf,"As a fan of XTC I naturally sought this out after reading rave reviews everywhere I read of XTC - ""brilliant! tongue in cheek! etc etc"" It is indeed a brilliant rendering of psychedelic pop. Too good, in fact, as it quickly reminds one of how mediocre the genre actually was. Any of these tracks would be right at home on the NUGGETS box-set, that's how faithfully they've rendered them. I know this alone is enough to make many music fans take notice, but as I am not a fan of the NUGGETS set (I know there are more of you out there!) this does little for me. I grew tired of most of the tracks after one listening. If you're an XTC fan looking for more XTC, buy anything of their you don't already have before resorting to this. If you're a fan of psychedelia, specifically SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS-era Pink Floyd, then by all means purchase this record - it's exactly what you're looking for."
2,Local review,"Really disappointed! VERY bad quality of the picture; the equivalent of a video tape, It is a pity for a dvd !"
4,awesome!,this is an awesome toy/replica. lots of fun. i been wanting this for 15 years and now i have one - now i need a tricorder :)
3,Star Trek Phaser Gun,Good product but it feels a little cheap. I thought it might a little nicer. If you're truly a Trekie then it's a must but don't expect much.
2,"Cheesy in many aspects, dull story, poorly written","It seems as though Joseph D. Pistone wishes to make himself the next James Bond by writing multiple novels all based on himself. Much like James Bond, some of these stories are great (My Life Undercover), and others, such as Deep Cover, are sloppy and dull. The setting in Deep Cover is in the Florida Everglades, and all of the native Floridians are, for lack of a better word, hicks: a complete 180 from the smart criminals he dealt with when infiltrating the mafia. It is unfair to expect it to be as good as the first book, but I still held Deep Cover to very high standards and was more than a little disappointed in the outcome. In my mind, Deep Cover is Die Another Day while My Life Undercover is Goldfinger."
5,Captain Amazingly Incredible and the Space Vampires from the Evil Planet!!!,"If you like Adult Swim or Monty Python, this may be the movie for you! The humor is sharp and snappy and keeps scenario chugging along at a good clip. The visual aspect is of a surreal quality with painterly backgrounds and a glowing technicolor look to the overall image. Highly imaginative and creative!Green screen walk on spot - Go!!"
2,Very very dark,"Fans of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro may not like this book as much as they did her Saint Germain titles. I didn't. I am not a fan of dark vampire novels, like Anne Rice's or this one. I much prefer the vampire as anti-hero, for example, Saint Germain or Tanya Huff's Henry Fitzroy.When I finished this one, I put it down and tried to figure out what my overall impression was. I think I was disappointed. I expected more from Ms. Yarbro, since I have read and reread all her Saint Germain novels.Still, if you're a fan of Anne Rice's Lestat, I think you'll enjoy The Angry Angel."
2,AUDIOPHILES STEER CLEAR !,"Well,this album has a lot of good singles,but the sound isterrible,especially on the live tracks which are substandard.I highly recommend getting Dead Citiesinstead,18 gorgeously remastered(won't believe yer ears,guaranteed)single versions most of which are not on the albums or areincluded in the latest remastered digipack editions.If you have the extra bucks and are a big fan get the Harry May Tin can cd,like me.I attended an Exploited's gig in Argentina yesterday and the band kicked @ss bigtime !!!!"
2,Oscar-winner: Best Use of the Ping Pong Ball!,"Wow! Pretty bad, even for early Corman! Odd mix of mobsters, hipsters n' monsters... but ya gotta love that bobble-eyed Creature that must have cost $3.95 at the local TG&Y! Too bad they don't give Oscars for Best Use of the Ping Pong Ball!"
1,Hahaha... is it a kind of joke?,"Well, this is the first time I consider Roger Corman as comedy. I always take and enjoy his work seriously. Maybe I was wrong; he can also make me laugh.I agree with other reviewer. Do not take this tittle seriously. Yes there's a monster creature, with silly form, silly furs, and silly eyes. It reminds me to ""It came from the outerspace"" creatures. The story goes about dirty plan of an american mob who want to take fortune from his passangers and put the blame on a mystical sea creature. What surprise is, the creature do exist and terrorize the gang.I don't know, why it is consider horror movie. It looks like ""Gilligan Island"" to me."
3,Not edited! This is the original theatrical version.,"The ""missing scenes"" were added for television, as it wasn't long enough to fill a 90 minute slot (with commercials of course). There are a number of films that had added scenes to them to bring them up over the 70 minute mark, like Not of This Earth and Attack of the Crab Monsters. Here you won't find the scenes where the spy character is chased through the streets and has a rendezvous, the song or the phone scenes on the island. There may be others that I don't recall. I didn't know about this practice till I got curious why this version had ""missing"" scenes."
2,Edited version!!!!!!!!,"Creature from the Haunted Sea - In COLOR! Also Includes the Restored Black-and-White Version!Note, Both the color and black and white versions on this DVDhave deleted the scene where she sings Creature from the haunted sea!How stupid!"
2,one of the few that isn't that great,"Usual plot and very cheesey, very cheesey!!! the monster is someone in a wetsuit with those googley eyes and spikes for claws, very low budget and the special effects are recorded animal sounds... kills some time but not that great"
1,Mediocrity Rules!,"The master of mediocrity, Roger Corman, made still another abysmal movie with what must have been a $60 budget. Everything about it is mediocre, from the acting, the monster costume, the dialogue, the quality of the film to the sound. The only redeeming feature in the movie is one that will greatly appeal to liberals because it indirectly justifies totalitarianism in Cuba by portraying some of the characters who are supposed to be Cuban in a really bad light. You can either flush your money down the toilet or you can buy this film. If you're a liberal, you'll buy this film---and call it a masterpiece."
1,Just give me a possitive feedback and leave this page!,"Why are you here dear costumer? I warn you to leave this page and never come back for your own good! if you have bonus 6 dollars, please just roll and burn it as a cigarette. that's better choice than buying such movie!"
3,BRUCE says,"The first time I saw this film was when I was 13 or so on a late night horror movie show in the mid sixties, I thought it was just a really dumb movie, but I liked it, I thought it was just someone trying to make a serious horror film that just turned out funny. When I saw the film for sale on DVD I just had to buy it, just to see if my boyhood memory of the film was true what I found was a film that must have been planed to be funny or at least I hope so, as a fan of really campie movies I have to rate The Creature from the Haunted Sea right up there with Plan 9 and other dumb movies, call me weird but I just like it its good for a giggle."
2,the backstory ...,"In Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters from the 1960's , writer Charles B. Griffiths (who penned Creature from the Haunted Sea ) admitted that the monster in this movie cost 50 bucks. It consisted, he said , of a fur coat, some ping pong balls for eyes, and garden claws for hands.If you watch it in this shrugging context, and go in with lowered expectations ( that is, just to have fun ) this movie is an example of what Corman and his team did best at this time. Movies that second-billed on a drive in while you were trying to retrieve a jordan almond from the back of your date's throat.Its not the best or worst example of the lot (and the beginning shots of cubans photographed in heavy shadow almost ALWAYS puts me to sleep), but what the heck. You laugh, throw popcorn at the screen and remember what 'scary movies' were like in an earlier, less graphic time."
4,good value,Nice and tough baseball bases with easy to use pins. Used during the summer and is suited for soft dirt or grass not on hard dry ground.
3,"Received the wrong size, but a very nice item","Purchased these for my adult slowpitch softball league. They are covered with high quality, thick vinyl that will easily last years. I'm concerned about the sewn brown tabs holding the straps, though. I think those will get ripped off in no time. The heavy metal stakes (10 inches long) are awesome. Note that the bases are only 2 inches thick, which would not be good in tall grass. I gave this product 3 stars instead of 4 stars because I ordered the 'official' 15-inch size and was shipped the 14-inch 'junior' size."
5,LOVE THEM,I absolutely love the bases. they have worked so well compared to what we had before. thanks a lot
4,Interesting book,"Although the author is a direct descendent of Charles Dickens, the writings is totally different. I enjoyed reading about the author's adventures very much."
3,Light Reading,"I really enjoyed this book. A look at the ""downstairs"" side of servitude, and some funny vignettes. Well written. Writing must run in the family - the author is the great(?) granddaughter of Charles Dickens."
3,Hose Housing,"Product worked fine until the hose connector broke. It was easy enough to replace, but unexpected. Connections could be made of more durable materials."
4,Suncast Hose Hideaway with Bin,"Excellent product. I like the bin because you can store a lot of accessories in it. I purchased a hose hideaway with a bin several years ago and really like having a bin to store accessories in. I searched all of local our home improvement stores including Home Depot, Lowes and Menards and they only stock the models without the bin so I was very pleased to see this on Amazon for the same price it would be in a store. I would have given five stars but the only downside to Suncast hose reel products is after about 3 years the part where the hose attaches comes loose and slides out making the unit worthless. I purchased the part that comes loose but the new part just slides out too."
1,We Bought Two - Big Mistake!,"We bought two of these hose reels for the front and back of our house. The first one broke after two years of use when the inner hose elbow split down the middle. The second one broke when the outside hose connection snapped. Although replacement parts are available from the manufacturer, these units are not designed for easy disassembly and replacement of parts. You can waste a lot of precious weekend time trying to fix these units. Unfortunately, I now have two hunks of plastic that seemed destined for the landfill. What a shame."
2,Works Well But Did Not Last,Mine leaked after two years at the seal point on the reel. I would not buy another one after examining how this is put together. Best for someone who likes to buy new things every two years or who enjoys ordering parts and making repairs to cheap plastic items.
1,Wrong-headed Engineering,"I knew the first time I reeled up my hose with this product that the excessive flex in the plastic handle and the shear on the plastic gear and reel were going to send this baby to its life cycle grave in weeks. (My spouse bought this reel sight unseen.) Sure enough, after two weeks, the reel sheared off as I was winding in a whopping 25 feet of empty hose. The design would work fine if a light weight metal alloy was used for the handle-gear-reel assembly, leaving the body to the cheap plastic, but that would probably put the price beyond what wholesale buyers are willing to put on the shelves at big box stores. Buy up the food chain--by the time you replace this one once you are already in the price category of a nicer, more durable hose reel."
1,Great idea but lacks quality,"I purchased this item in 2005, and it worked great for about 2 years when the reel that the hose rolls onto split in two. I replaced it because I *really* liked the storage compartment on top, but the second one broke after 2 years as well."
1,Great Concept - But Lacking Quality,Had mine for four years. Lasted 2 1/2 years the first time. Fixed it last spring with $40 worth of parts. That lasted until this spring and it broke again. Same parts broke each time. The four parts that form the take-up reel. If you like to waste money and fix things I would give this item 5 Stars. A real shame because this is really a handy item in the garden.
3,"Great idea, poor execution","Love the storage section. Keep my trowels in it, which would otherwise just lay around on the ground.Despite a 75 ft hose in it, I can still drag this huge cabinet like unit it while watering the garden.They need to make it heavier and improve the moving parts. I have been using it with a broken handle for a while. Finally throwing it away."
5,Hideaway Hosanna,"The Suncast Hose Hideaway is terrific. It's tall, so you don't have to bend way over. The storage unit inside is just what we needed. Case is durable, product easy to use. Hose unwinds and then rewinds with ease. We weren't able to find anything like this at the hardware or improvement stores in our area, but Amazon came through for us again."
4,HOSE REEL STORAGE,"We had a previous item that was similar to this made by Suncast and over many years it just wore out! We tried to find a replacement at many, many locations and no one carried anything like it anymore. We even went to the Suncast web site, but they don't sell to the public...now that is a problem! We found this on Amazon and the price was good and we received it in less than a week. Overall we are very pleased with the item, although we wish the wheels were larger which would make it easier to maneuver. There were a few ""marks"" on the hose guide/bin, but they were cosmetic and since it sits outside we kept it. I would recommend this item to someone who wants to store their hose away, as well as store some of the nozzles and other outdoor hose equipment with it..."
4,Good Product,"The product was good, the sale process simple, the delivery was on time. All good reasons to place future orders here again!"
5,Suncast Hose Hideaway - Great Product!,"We use 4 of these hose boxes around our house. They are sturdy and attractive and make pulling out and reeling in 100-foot hoses as easy as possible. The Suncast company is great to work with. If you do need a replacement part for the hose box, just provide the serial number and date of purchase and most parts are covered under their warranty and will be shipped to you free of charge, even if the hose box is 5 years old! The Suncast website is excellent to use and identify the part you need. This is a truly great product that I highly recommend."
5,Wonderful item!,Love this! Love the storage tray and that the cover is dark brown. It reels very nice. The overall unit is slick.
4,My wife loved it,"We have a running joke at my house, when my wife asked for a bottle of this years ago she said ""and its very hard to find they dont make it any more"" and I went out to Pennys and found a huge display of it. Not so much anymore, so glad to find it on Amazon"
1,It's Fake,"The packaging was different from original. Perfume has very similar smell, but with strong alcohol scent. Golden coloring on the bottle itself came off after couple uses."
1,Uddo Serrano,"Buenas, amigo pedí 3 colonias y las que llegaron fueron 2 bill blass 1 de euphoria?? pido una explicación ustedes mandaron el paquete completo o robaron en el envio"
2,Strange product...,I tried to purchase this product from the different sellers. All of them deliver the bottle in the open box. It does not like an original Blass product...
5,smells soooooooo nice \,I've purchased this perfume for many years only to have it taken out of stores. The Amazon way was the only way for me to get my favorite perfume. Nude by Bill Blass leaves you smelling soft and clean. I've had people stop me in the stores and ask me what perfume I was wearing. At first I thought I was wearing to much -- a definite no no!! I hope Amazon has enough of a supply to last me all my days.
3,Good ... but I think there are better nude scents ...,"Bill Blass Nude opens screeching with aldehydes but then settles into a wonderful skin scent on me ... about 15 minutes to get there, at which point it's nearly intoxicating.BB Nude is less nude than Bijan Nude, but it's still nude, if that makes any sense. Between Nude and Nude, I initially preferred the Bill Blass Nude because I found a Sophia Grojsman that I can wear on my skin! However, now I prefer Bijan Nude.I wouldn't say that it's love. However, this fragrance has a role in my wardrobe. I can where it anytime, anywhere when I just want to smell clean and good. I don't have to think about it - just grab it, spray it, and go."
4,Gift purchase,"A Bavarian friend wanted me to purchase this item because they couldn't get it there. I found that it is no longer being made, so I purchased 2 bottles for them. However, when I tried to send them through the mail, I found that the post office doesn't allow perfume to be sent. The only saving grace was that a local person is traveling there and took it with him. At this point, I presume it made it. I won't hear from the recipient for a couple of weeks. Hopefully, it wasn't a purchase in vain."
1,Keep your money,I'm really wondering what the hype is about this perfume. It really stinks! It's way too strong. If you use more than one spray you'll need a gas mask. Yeah. I'm definitely returning it.
4,Efforttless?,"The techniques are defined in depth, but they are not ""Effortless"" by any stretch of the imagination. It is a book, not a sifu, so thr reader needs to be familiar with the techniques to benefit from the technical aspects of the text."
1,basic book with very poor pictures,"I ordered this book based on the extraordinarily fabulous reviews posted on Amazon.com. Upon review, I was very disappointed, and returned it. My advice is save your money or order a book that you've held in your hands and know it's worth. By the way, this is the second review that I've submitted on this book, and the other one was bad-Amazon.com didn't release it."
2,the dark side,"Cartmell knows a lot about martial arts,,,,,but he does seem to know much about photography. He has both tori and uke wearing grey t-shirts and black pants. Furthermore nobody taught the photographer to open up the lens aperature to let a little light into the camera. All the photos are too dark. So the result is in most of the pictures, there is a mass of black where four legs ought to be, and some arms and hands, but you can't really tell which arms belong to whom.The book needs to reprinted on good paper, hire a photographer and make the book something to showcase Mr. Cartmells' vast knowledge. As it is, it's a good read, but the last 2/3 of the book are really pretty useless."
2,Corny and predictable!!!,"While the story was mostly entertaining and a quick read, the plot lacked depth. While I love a happy ending, this book tried to wrap up too many issues all in about 200 pages - just not enough dimension."
5,One of the BEST summer reads ever,"This is a sure winner...I couldn't put it down. What a lovely love story, and so true..our world is so full of people not looking beyond..unless you have a pretty face..I wanted Lily to fall in love with Charlie..I fell in love with him too..it has really changed alot of my views..making me realize that we do treat people like that..and I for one am ashamed of it."
2,Shallow writing...,"As the wife of a spinal cord injured man, I was eager to read this novel. However, I was hugely disappointed with the simple way it brushed through the traumatic issues of rehab, grief, and acceptance -- on the entire family's part, not just the young man's. While I didn't expect a medical tome on the subject of SCI, in just a few pages everyone had adjusted beautifully -- thanks to some pretty lame comedy -- and lives happily ever. Very unrealistic. These characters are one-dimensional, each one straining blood vessels to be funny. Thumbs down."
5,I love you Iris!,"When I saw that Iris Rainer Dart had a new book out, I knew right away that I would be in for several most enjoyable hours. My only problem was that the book had to end. Dart is not afraid to tackle unusual, off the beaten path story lines. Her characters are both real and complicated. Some might say, I don't want to read about tragedies, but please give her a chance. This is what life is all about. You'll laugh & cry with this book. At the risk of letting the cat out of the bag, suffice to say that Lily learned what is truly important in life, in regard to Charlie. Iris, you are ""one of us""; I wish you were writing for a TV show currently. Oh, and when you get this book, savor it. It is such a page turner, that you'll have to try to slow yourself down. Read it while eating your favorite food; that's what I did. It makes the food and the book oh so much more tasty!!!"
3,not what we expected,"The purple smoke dye was a lot lighter in color than what we had expected from looking at the color on the listing. It was more of like a light lilac color. It was a birthday present for my niece, and she still liked it - but you could tell she didnt love it. Also, the color seemed to fade fairly faster than I thought it would."
3,Wood models,"This book offers an opporftunity to learn about making wooden models and toys with mechanical movements. I had the idea that I could use it to make interesting and educational toys for my grandchildren. I may be able to do that with a bit more experience, but the material presented is too complicated for a basic start. It is a good reference book and I would buy it again at a reasonable price. It is not worth the price that is listed as new."
5,I like this record!,"Now this is more the way I like it! (Much better than that guy who is the big star of Austin.) I could listen to this CD from the instant the sun comes up until my head hits the pillow once again. These Household Names should be big stars in America, no? ""Great American Public"" makes my heart smile and there is no end to the melody and rocking out on all the songs. My friend Miou Miou knows how to find all the good music."
5,Household Names,I found this CD at the Minus Zero Record shop in London. I find the songs pleasing to my ears very much so. I cannot stop listening and moving around to the beat. I wish the Household Names would do a tour of Europe or the UK as I have many friends there. I wish the French bands would sound so nice!
3,Flared my IC,"I dont have IC too bad, but I just survived my first flare up about 8 months ago & finally felt capable of exercising, so I got this dvd hoping it would ease me back into things. The work outs probably wont send the average person into a sweat but because Im so weak at this point it was a nice warm up for me. However, sadly, about a half hour after I stopped the work out, my bladder was pissed for a few days....I guess I'll just stick to the tredmill & recumbent bike. Seems to work best for me...But I seemed doomed to have a flabby tummy since I cant work it out..."
4,Nice video,"If you are looking for an intense workout, this is not the DVD to get. It is nice to see a video available for those with interstitial cystitis. The stretching makes you feel great. I also like how you can select what area of your body you want to work on. I would like to see the price a little cheaper."
5,Good one,Nice book with a good description of acid base balance and electrolyte disturbances. Time spent reviewing concepts is well wort it.
5,The best in its field,"I found this book to be very useful in understanding the subject of acid base and electrolyte disorders. I recommend it for all physicians especially those working in emergency room, intensive and cardiac care units. In fact it is very helpful for all doctors working in the different clinical fields. It is simple and easily digested."
2,Rain or Buzz?,"This thing is a cheap piece of plastic, and for the same price you can get the larger, nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well. I can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor. It has a nice design in terms of look and it's compact. I also enjoy the lights for ambiance. But for relaxation, this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it's worth."
1,You get what you pay for...,"Probably should have bought something more 'significant' Fortunately since the cost was minimal, I wasn't out much money. I never used it...it made weird noises. After reading the instructions, which had a lot of material on the noise factor, I had my doubts it would be something that would sound relaxing. These doubts were confirmed."
2,disappointing,"bought this for my wife as she loves the sound of rain. It didn't live up to that very well. she has had other HOmedics fountains in the past and loved them, but this one didn't work all that well and was constanly either running over or running out of water. Pump burned up in a short time too."
2,Not worth spending money on,"I'm a bit perplexed by the positive reviews here. A low budget is not a valid excuse to create junk, as many excellent low-budget movies have proved.One good thing about this movie is the big redneck-ish guy. Avoiding spoilers, let's just say he's the only well-developed character in the film and my opinion of him did a complete 180.There are pluses; some very convincing after-the-fact gore, some surprisingly well-written humor, the aformentioned well-done character, and there is one simply great moment when a survivor is snatched from a chair.Otherwise there's absolutely nothing here, even if the positive comments above seem like the makings of a good flick. The CGI is just utterly awful awful awful (repeat, rinse, repeat). Why bother if you're going to do it so badly? The alien creature design is pretty poor and they don't look strong enough to break a twig, let alone maul someone to the extent here.It has it's moments, but this is really just a throwaway."
2,A Backward Glance,"Unfortunately, A Backward Glance was a disappointment. I love the way Edith Wharton writes, but in her autobiography she was dry. I only read only a quarter of the book and then put it down. It's hard to get through. I don't know if I can pick it up again. I would actually like to send it back, mainly because it was an expensive book; more than I usually pay."
1,Stupid software,"Once again I am disgusted with sony! I DON'T have windows, but I must if I am going to program this remote. Everything sony does is done just well enough to get it out to sell. If it doesn't work the way the consumer needs it to, well stupid you for buying it. As much as this remote would help with the 10 remotes that clutter my end table, I can't use it because sony doesn't have software for Mac users."
1,how to spend your money on junk,"I find the remote almost totally useless for my modern tv setup, (even if all the other units are sony. It is supposed to be touch screen,(it would take a hammer to fufil that designation. I have purchased a Harmony remote which is completely functional for all needs. the sony unit isin the corner gathering dust."
3,Universal Remote Commander,"Software must be used to program this beast of a remote control. Unfortunately some of the codes for Sony devices don't work, so one must use the learning function. Otherwise, definitely a conversation piece that is also quite functional.Touchscreen, stainless finish, and aqua blue backlighting make this a nice classy remote. It seems that any software Sony makes is clunky (i.e. Minidisc jukebox software, digital picture/clock radio).Battery life (4x AA) is reasonable and the remote provides endless arrays of macros and express features."
2,beware of seller 10 twelve,I almost bought this remote used from 10 twelve until a lack of return policy worried me. I asked seller if cable & software come with answer was no. That renders remote useless unless you can get these from sony note remote no longer sold by sony.Seller lowered price but situation still the same
2,You have to be an M.I.T. grad to program this thing!!,"My wife bought me the Sony commander for Christmas and, almost a month later, I still haven't got this thing figured out yet. I can't believe how complicated programming this remote is. The accompanying software isn't user friendly at all. X-press settings -- forget about it!! I owned the earlier version of this same remote which, unfortunately, fizzled out but it was much easier to program manually. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone and it's difficult to believe that this is an actual Sony product."
1,Total JUNK!,"Replacing an older RM-AV3000, I just got the RM-AX4000. Programming is not very intuitive. Finally got through it though. One of the steps is to press ""learn"", where one is directed to press (for example), the ""play"" button on a DVD remote. The normal operation is that one presses the button for a few seconds, and then ""learning complete"" appears. Sometimes, however, it takes ten or fifteen seconds, or (worse), one *immediately* receives a message that no signal has been received.After going through this half a dozen times, I called Sony and and spent 4.5 hours on hold. I finally found that if I darkened the room completely, things went better.Tonight, I noticed that if I select (for example) channel 2-4-0, I get channel 2-4-000, or if I select 2-3-1, I get 2-33-1. Just gave up!This thing is going back."
3,Sony AX4000A Home Remote,"For sure you have to read the manual to understand how to program the remote unit. Make use of the setup CD to program your remote can prove easier via PC than manually learn the code from remote controllers. With PC setup, you can maximise the use of program xpress and airslide function.The setup CD software able to store/backup the setting in case you lose the setting when changing battery.Not recommended for consumer that prefer a off-the-shelf gadget and use it right-away."
2,Good product IF You have all Sony component,I have all Sony product except an Onkyo receiver and Hd cable box. I used the op-pc and no luck. Tried manual and only get part of the controls. Logitech Harmony has a better remote however the battery life is so short.
4,Works Real Good with Sony Electronics,"the only problems i have with this remote are that it does not work with my sony cdr/cd player recorder, deck A plays cd's and the remote works with that deck, but deck B records cd's and the remote will not work with it. also this remote has no drivers or upgrade support for windows vista when you try to program the remote. thank goodness for my old pc that still uses windows xp. all in all im happy with my purchase."
3,A Slight Disappointment,"While I like the charm, I have to be completely honest in that I was slightly disappointed. I expected it to be much more substantial. It is very light weight and the diamond presence is very small. The design, however, is very pretty and I really like that aspect of it. Some might like the weight of it because it won't weigh down their charm bracelet or make a lot of noise. I just happen to like my charms to be more substantial."
1,not worth it,"Maybe I just haven't gotten used to them but I feel that they were not worth the money. They are pretty uncomfortable as noted by some reviewers who gave it five stars, having to find ways to make it comfortable on the nose. I feel that comfort should be a big part of any type of accessories. Without the padding, they stuck to my face leaving unwanted marks and were uncomfortable during my whole swim. They can be and are a bit uncomfortable. If not assembled correctly leakage occurs and it is a pain to redo. Don't get to excited about these goggles, the lack of padding leaves them uncomfortable.Hopefully you found this review helpful!"
4,A fun suspense-thriller,"Unlike the other reviewer from San Francisco, I have to admit that I really enjoyed this book for the suspense novel it is. I've successfully handsold several copies to customers where I moonlight based on the synopsis of the protagonist showing up at work only to find that none of her coworkers claim to know her. What I enjoyed about it most was that half way through the book I was sure there could be no resolution to my satisfaction without involving the occult or some supernatural goofiness, but Klavan actually accounts for everything quite nicely and summed it all up to my satisfaction. It wasn't great literature but a fun summer read. Sometimes that's all you need."
3,A fast-paced thriller...,"...marred only slightly by a confusing ending. A brilliantly twisted Twilight Zone murder mystery, nonetheless."
2,Too disturbing,"I love Andrew Klavan, and this book is up to his usual dazzling standards of writing style. Not only that, but the construction is brilliant; I read a lot of thrillers, and yet I've never encountered anything quite like it. A real tour de force.Nevertheless, I'm afraid I can't recommend it, because it is so, so, so, so, SO disturbing. It has left me with images I wish I could scrub from my mind."
4,Well Done,Wow - my first book by this author and it won't be my last. It grips you from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed Mr. Klavan's descriptions which made me feel as though I was experiencing Nancy's terror and confusion right along with her. All the characters in the book seemed real and were very memorable. I'm somewhat confused by some of the other reviews here and I'm glad I didn't read them first. Being from New Jersey and having recently visited NYC might have added to my enjoyment of the scenic descriptions but that is not at all a necessary proviso to thoroughly enjoy this unique and riveting plot. Can't wait to sink my teeth into the next Klavan novel.
2,Thrill Seeker? Then don't look here for it.,"This book seemed to be interesting and odd, which I'd ordinarilly go for. While reading this book; however, I became disgusted by the repeated references to sex, which didn't go with the book or were needed. If they did, then I'd be more understanding. The occurrences in this story were weak, as well as unbelievable, and I found myself falling asleep everytime I gave it another try. Yes, I finished the book, and I give it 2 stars only because the irony involved in the end fooled me and was very well executed. Other than that, uh...no."
3,Would it have KILLED him to include some more examples?,"Johnson is a brilliant man and a thought-provoking writer, but EXTREMELY abstract. Again and again, I was fascinated but bewildered. If Johnson had given us just a few more examples of how the archetype of Parsifal is reflected in the lives of real men, this book could change lives.As it was, I was as much frustrated as I was intrigued. If I had not already done a little work with archetypes and psychological rituals, I would have been totally baffled.Johnson's ""Owning Your Own Shadow"" is far more comprehensible and valuable, at least to me. Also, his ""Inner Work"" is almost all practical suggestions for work on oneself, and very good."
3,Understanding happiness muddled by occasional religious blather,"I found the basic teaching of this book about happiness enlightening. Understanding we cannot find or pursue happiness. We simply choose happiness by living in the ""happening."" Something we've all been told, but a concept that does not easily sink in without meditating on it. This book is just that meditation.The one inconsistency in this book is its occasional spattering of religiosity. I find it odd how the author relates jungian theory and then religiosity. It takes away from the focus of the story and muddles the reader's focus. It gives a feeling of inconsistency, almost as though added in after the fact to please someone's whims. The jungian theory goes side by side with the main concept of the book, the religiosity only serves to distract, thus weakening the message.In summary if you can manage to ignore these blips, you will gain a valuable perspective on life."
2,At least it's short,"This book doesn't speak to me at all. I agree with Robert A. Johnson that legends and myths, as well as great works of literature, correspond to the human condition--after all, that's what makes them resonate with generations of readers. However, I don't see the usefulness of picking one and elevating it to a grand statement and prescriptive account of the life journey of every man. His interpretation of the Parsifal myth lacks concrete examples from actual human experience. If you accept his premise, you might find great meaning here, but I didn't swallow it for a minute. As an atheist, I also found his emphasis on Christianity to be useless."
4,I Liked It!,"I purchased ""The Sands of Mars"" years ago after I read another novel (The Songs of Distant Earth) which I adored.I really enjoyed reading ""The Sands of Mars"". It was an unusual read since Mr. Clarke had written the novel many years ago - when many assumptions at that time about the moon and planets have been proven false today. In fact, Mr. Clarke mentions that in the preface of my book - and asks the readers to see how many they can spot (like plants that grow on the Moon and Mars, to name a few). These distractions should not at all take away from the novel. It's actually a simple and straightforward story. A writer (of Science-Fiction), named Martin, decides to go to Mars - which is still in it's infancy of colonialism. The story then relates of the colony's attempts at maintaining the colony on Mars as well as their attempt at terraforming the planet. It's a good story, that many should enjoy!"
5,Sands of Time...,"I read the book about 23 years ago and have re-read it time and time again. What it lacks sytlistically it makes up for in sheer joy of discovery and achievement by its characters on a Mars that was a valid extrapolation from knowledge at the time (c.1950) of writing. Good SF is about real people in a world that really might be - hence the personal secrets that are discovered along-side the planetary ones as the novel progresses.Mars officially is a cold, lifeless world, but the author Arthur Clarke has endorsed recent claims of life evidenced in space-probe photos. He might be mistaking hype for science, and geology for biology, but he might also have ""The Sands of Mars"" in the back of his mind too."
2,Reads like a bunch of shorts,"I wanted to know what was going on on Mars but along the way, I had to read a bunch of what seemed to me like short boring stories. Extremely anti climatic as far as I am concerned. Oh well... NEXT!"
4,Good Mars story.,"This is the first AC Clarke book I ever read. Live on Mars in a bubble, and then unveil a covered up alien device that could create oxegeon. There was a recent movie that was amazingly close to the story of this book. Total Recall?"
2,Part of Clarke's one novel per planetary body pulp series.,Arthur C. Clarke wrote a sequence of novels in the 1950's and 60's each had a different celestial body as it's locale.The Sands of Mars is of course the Mars book in this sequence. It is pulp science fiction in a short novel format.
1,Do Not Buy This Edition!,"This is not a review of Seven Men, which is a wonderful book, well worth reading. Instead, this is a review of the Dodo Press edition of the book. Hard to believe, but it is not a complete version of the book, and is missing two chapters! It's not ""Seven Men"" but instead, just""Five Men!"" Definitely read this book, but purchase the NYRBC edition instead -- it's actually the complete book!"
5,The Divine Max,"Bernard Shaw called Beerbohm ""the divine Max,"" and this collection of short pieces will tell you why. The book consists of short character sketches of six men (Beerbohm is the ever present seventh), and each one is a small masterpiece of Edwardian parody and humour. Beerbohm's line sketches of each one of his (imaginary?!) characters are included at the end of the book. Some of the tales have an unexpectedly supernatural twist (the neo-Faustian bargain struck by Enoch Soames being the best of the lot). Three cheers for the NYRB Press for bringing these forgotten gems back into print."
1,Mutilated PoS,"This isn't even five men, as another reviewer said. It's four and a half. Try to read ""Savanorola Brown"" and you'll find that the sublime middle part of the story is just... not there!Amazon, when will you allow ratings for your defective Kindle ratings, separately from the books they allegedly digitalize? Not only is this not worth the $0.00 you'll pay: you'll regret the spoilers that you get to when you read past the missing section. This is the kind of thing I HATE."
3,Somewhat disappointing but worth reading,"There are two stories in this collection that are incomparable: ""Enoch Soames"" and ""Savaranola Brown"". For the story of Enoch Soames alone, this collection is perhaps worth the price. Enoch Soames is a disheartened poet who is unappreciated. One day he becomes fed up with his inability to court fame (his second book sells 3 copies) and so makes an agreement with the devil to travel to the future to learn what's been written about him in return for an eternal trip to the Devil's home. I can't reveal what happens next, but suffice it to say that the story revels in metaphysical twists and fascinating character sketches.Most of the other stories were disappointing (John Updike admits as much in the introduction). But if you've never read Beerbohm, this is a good place to start."
1,Boring and stiff,"This is a rather boring and stiff DVD - my 3.5 year old daughter watched it for 5 minutes before asking for a change. This may scare some people off from ballet rather than encouraging them! The disclaimers at the front of the DVD, although perhaps necessary - add to the sense of seriousness of this DVD. Not recommended."
2,To basic,"i bought this ballet 101 and 201. it is very ,very basic. i learned most of this stuff in 2 classes. i am glad i didnt buy this from here because it is almost 22 dollars. i bought the VHS versions somewhere else and only paid 11 dollars.. which after today i still think is to much. this still a good video but not enough time is spent on warm-up which could lead to hurting yourself if you dont know what you are doing. i say warn up for about 20 mins before doing any ballet. do not let your kids do this alone they will hurt themselves. it is great for in between classes to stay current and develop technique but you and you child will pass up this dvd/vhs in a few classes and find no need for it very soon. i suggest the The ballet workout it is an older taper but much more indepth about the barre work and center work and alot harder, and actually more fun."
4,"Not a bad DVD, but won't give you much of a workout","This video will teach you basic steps and terminology, but you won't get much more out of it if you're looking to exercise.As an introduction to Ballet, though, it is excellent."
4,Ballet 101,This DVD is great for a child who would like to have the feel of her own teacher at home and be involved in ballet starting with the basics. I have a special needs child and this worked great!
3,BALLET 101,"Good supplement for he beginning ballet student. The video has some good basic barre and center work exercises, although the 45 minutes seem too short. One can easily put in 1 hour of basic exercise material even for a basic class."
2,Not inspirational,"I was really looking forward to this DVD after reading reviews but it is not inspirational for me at all, as a result I don't use it."
4,A Beginners Ballet 101,"This is actually a pretty good video. I purchased it for myself (43) because I wanted to learn basic ballet. If you are looking for a workout video...this is not it. But if you are looking to learn the first basic steps of ballet and condition your legs and ankles to move like they need to, then this is a good start. I recomend it for all ages as it is very easy step by step and slow moving process. My 3 year old was able to keep up on the first half easily. I do wish they had more stretching and that each move was done more then one time through. I paused the video to be able to do the steps a few time through. Overall, It is very simple and easy steps."
2,Poor quality visuals,NARA has better stuff than this hopefully. Really scratchy old film that looks like it's been filmed off a TV set...
5,Home Improvement,The DVD was received in excellent condition and the packaging was great. We now own all the Home Improvement series and enjoy them over and over. Thanks for a great product.
5,always funny,loved the show when it was on didnt get to see all of it til now. good value for a great show
5,Great Show!,"This is one of my favorite shows to watch when it is on TV, so I figured why not watch it whenever I want to. Love all the extra features on the discs and is so much fun to watch. Great for anyone who loves Home Improvement. Would highly recommend. Not disappointed at all."
5,Perfect entertainment,THe 4th season is a MUST for all Home Improvement fans! It's actually better than the 3rd season and it's very interesting to watch how the different characters like Wilson progress in their lifes. But the most important factor: The jokes are still hilarious as hell!!!
3,sound is weird,"I bought the 3rd, 4th, and 5th seasons together. The 3rd season is the same as the 1st and 2nd as far as picture, sound and disc appearance. Under 3 stars Richard Coleman remarks that the 4th season disc are transparent which is true, but I didn't get the chinese writing with mine. The most annoying thing is the sound. The music and background laughter are louder than the talking. It's almost unwatchable! The picture is also dark and a little out of focus. I noticed the 5th season discs have the same appearance but I haven't watched them yet. I wouldn't think they're pirated but I'm not sure I would recommend them."
3,See through disc.,I don't know if this means its a pirate copy but the disc is see through and the title is in chinese when we insert the disc into the computer. Works alright though and the show is good.
3,cute but narrow,"These are so cute, but they are not medium width. I have other Daniel Greens that are so comfortable, but these are limo slippers. I wore them for 5 minutes and they crushed my little toes and left marks on my instep."
5,Good Classic Album!!!!,"I've always been down with Mack 1-0! When word got out he signed with Cash Money I was skeptical somewhat, but picked the album up on day one. First off the production, with majority by Mannie Fresh is timeless. Second, Mack showed his versatility by spitting his 16 bars effortlessly over Mannies beats! My favorites to get me going with them JL Audio's is Work and No Dick! When u wanna roll out in the Caddy CTS u gotta bump Hate in yo eyes, but Let the thugs In the Club is a boulevard banger! Point is do urself & hip hop a favor add this to your collection, & guaranteed satifaction!"
4,Hate In Yo Eyes,"Originally I bought this CD for the song Hate In Yo Eyes. Other good songs on this album are Connected For Life, That ***** Is Bad, No **** At All, and We Can Never Be Friends."
5,Mack 10 is back,"Mack 10 and Cash Money are the perfect combination. Stand out tracks are ""Hate in Yo Eyes"", ""B**** you Bad"", ""No D***"", and ""Connected"". Mannie Fresh supplies the hot beats and Mack Dime holds it down along with BG, Wayne, Turk, Big Tymers, XZIBIT, E-40, Butch Cassidy, Ice Cube, and WC. Buy this--NOW."
4,Well Done!!!,"Mack 10 brings it back to the fundamentals on this one. This is not a very cash money type recording. The beats are west meets south and the rhymes are back to that hoo-bangin (...). He has guest from scarface, ice cube, e-40, and xzibit. Give this a chance its betta then his last two albums."
1,Mack 10 in full on sell out mode!,"This is Mack 10 (and probably Rap) is his worst! I think this album makes it quite obvious that he needs Ice Cube as a mentor. There is one outstanding track on the album 'hate in yo eyes', I can't say i'm surprised he sees hate in peoples eyes if he subjects them to this kind of rap.Filled with fillers and guest appearances from utter nobodies (apart from Cube and WC on track 5) this album was a huge let down for me. I've enjoyed all of Mack 10's albums even the paper route, but this album has nothing to really get your teeth into and bounce along to like 'Foe Life' or 'From tha Streetz'. Cash Money have done Mack an injustice on this one and proves he didn't make the right choice in moving to the label last year.All in all I think this album will be a great disappointment to any Dedrick Rollinson fan out there, and I think it might lose any fans he has left, I know I'll be thinking twice about buying his next album if he ever brings another one out!"
1,Hooper is not a reliable source for Lewis material.,"Serious Lewis scholars have known for years that significant questions exist about the veracity of Walter Hooper with respect to his relationship with the famous Christian writer. Kathryn Lindskoog, among others has written extensively on this subject.With this in mind, works by or about Lewis, which are written by, edited by or annotated by Hooper must be considered of questionable validity and value."
1,Bad science,"The idea is interesting, but if you can't get basic facts straight, what are you actually teaching them? Need I point further than the misspelled ""mantel"" [sic] on the cover? Ok, how about listing Mars as the 2nd planet from the Sun (p. 135)? I found these two errors in my first 3 minutes looking at this book. They wash over the more difficult concepts to the point where you aren't really learning anything at all, and what you learn is up to widely varying interpretations. Fortunately, Amazon users can use the ""Search Inside"" feature to see for themselves.Again, the idea is interesting, but they need to work on the delivery, and make sure the fundamentals are correct. Right now, avoid until at least the 3rd or 4th edition."
1,Somebody Goofed!,"Somebody at the mastering plant was sleeping because the voice and picture are out of sync with one another, making this look like an English dub of a foreign movie. And yes I know Welles often post dubbed his films after shooting, but this DVD will have you thinking of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN instead of Kafka. Beware.(Laserlight Edition)"
4,This will remind you of leaving an apartment!,"I try to leave and cannot without a price, but thus it is with Joseph K! As an unpleasant nurse, Romy Schneider tastes good in my eyes."
2,Purists beware...,"While an entertaining piece of cinema in and of itself, Orson's rendition of The Trial will leave a purist squirming for the duration of the film. Welle's takes many liberties with Kafka's novel. Some are decent, however in my opinion most were either too much or simply over the top."
1,Poorest of movies,"Admittedly, I'm no Einstein, (and am NO idiot) but this movie is truly an ""enigma."" From the opening scene, to the finish, it's plot is dream-like. Anthony Perkins has never been a favorite of mine, but his lithe-like form appearing at random, and with no decernable plot, makes this a movie that you could easily leave it to do a house chore,....return to the continuing mysterious appearances of the scenes and the characters, who appear and then disappear without any obvious plot unfolding. One would know that with Orson Wells participation, that my description is fairly accurate. The mock trial is completely ridiculous, and past understanding, at least for me. IT'S A TERRIBLE MOVIE!"
2,"Not much into the "" noir "" style of film making.","This film is dark in more ways than one. My copy was way dark. Of course it is emotionally dark also. Didn't much like the novel in college & my opinion hasn't improved. It was a pain to sit through it. This subject has so much promise but not with a depressive like Kafka. One of Welles lesser films to be sure. But one extra star for Welles portayal of the advocate, the best thing in this film."
1,Pretty boring,"I first saw this movie long ago. I couldn't remember much about it, so I got it and watched it again. I must have walked out the first time, because while I remembered bits and pieces of the first part, the last part was like a new movie to me. I struggled to stay awake. My girlfriend went to bed. Film classic? Maybe, but I don't know why.Incidentally, it seems to me the late smash hit ""Chicago"" has the same essential plot line, except in ""Chicago"" the accused really did it, and ""Chicago"" is gloriously and necessarily pumped up with some fine song and dance."
4,Don't let it scare you off,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was the weirdest and oddest thing I had ever seen. I only rented it because I love Anthony Perkins. Well, I ended up reading the novel. I recommend doing this first. It makes this movie much clearer. Now I must say that I love this movie. It is gripping, intriguing and even funny at times. I hope you love Joseph K. and Leni as much as I do!"
4,a powerful vision of Kafka's work,"I first saw this on a late night movie show on an obscure UHF station in the early eighties. I was very surprised to see anyone even tried to make a movie of this novel. It's amazing how effectively Welles adapts the very surreal masterpiece by Franz Kafka. Trying to present this in a standard, linear storyline is impossible so, instead, Welles does a superb job recreating the atmosphere of the novel with outstanding cinematography. The performances are excellent as well.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is I don't know how comprehensible the storyline would be without reading the book. I read the book before seeing the movie so I'll never know the answer but it's something for a potential buyer to consider."
3,Cheap Version - and it shows - Good Film Though...,The transfer is terrible - the sound awful- but if you want to see a great film for hardly any money - this is not a terrible choice.Welles is one of the few directors who could ever dream of capturing the clausterphobia of Kafka's writing - and although it is not a perfect vision - it is all the same a great piece of cinematic art.
4,Two TRIAL DVDs are not the same quality!!,"There are two different DVD versions of Orson Welles' The Trial, both available on Amazon. These are not the same quality. I give a four-plus star rating to the Milestone edition, which is beautiful and has some nice extras. BEWARE of the $5.50 version!"
4,This Laserlight verison is NOT the restored version...,that everyone else here is reviewing. It is a scratchy public domain version. Not a bad buy...definately a bargain basemenet edition of a great film.
2,Poorly done.,This movie was so choppy and confusing it was a real drag. The message was lost in the muddle. Welles said it was his best film. Shows that artists aren't the best judges of their own work.
2,The Trial video VHS,The quality of the video is not as good as I thought.The motion picture was twice seen by me in the sixties.Recently I read the book and I would like to get the same feeling as before by watching the videofilm at home.But I am afraid to say that the quality is not that good to recommand this video to others.Hampie
4,Great batteries and PRICE!!,"for the price, can't beat these little guys. i feel like they are just as good as the name brand batteries that probably cost twice as much (if not more)...i'm sold on them... !"
3,Layout for the new paperback edition is not cookbook or cooking friendly,"While the recipes look delish, and the cookbook is full of pretties, the new paperback layout for this book does not make this book kitchen friendly. The book is small in size, with an inflexible spine, making it difficult to keep the book open to read the recipes. I'm seriously thinking of returning this book and buying an older copy, perhaps a hardback version, as I can not see how I could use this book to cook with unless I typed out individual recipes for kitchen use.Overall, the information looks good but the book layout is very poor.Do not recommend for these reasons."
3,don't like the new layout/look. still a classic though!,the directions with the recipes could have been written out with a little more detail.a little to general in the execution of the dishes.i'm also not happy with the graphic overhaul of the book.i suppose someone wanted to impart some sort of comtemporary aesthetic appeal to the book but i rather prefer the layout of the previous editions of this book.still all in all the book should have a place on the cookbook shelf of anyone who is seriously interested in traditional Puerto Rican cuisine.
4,Like it,"I bought the book, because my wife was asking me if I could teach her Puertorican meals. Well she like the book very much and I am enjoying the meals."
2,LIVING AMONG TOMBTONES,"SOME PARTS WERE INTERESTING, BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO STRUGGLE THROUGH PAGES AND PAGES OF BORING INFORMATION, BEFORE YOU FOUND THEM."
4,Baby Steps,"The book is a great text book for english classes. It is made to be simply understood. There aren't many big words that would confuse you or explanations that make you crazy because you can't understand. There are many subjects in the book that teaches you ""how-to"" do things involving reading and writing. The text really does go baby steps, i enjoyed doing the assignments in the text, as weird as it may sound. But it is honestly not that bad. It also has a lot of great articles that would interest many people. Hope whoever buys this similar text, would be enlightened by it too."
4,Excellent CD of Early Whiesnake,"When they REALLY rocked. In the same vein as Snakebite, Saints & Sinners and Come An' Get It. I don't know all about all the band members like other fans do. I just like the way they sound here. I wanted to write this review so other fans would know what to expect. A must have for any Whitesnake collection."
3,Some of these were cute,"Leanin' Tree has some of the most beautifully illustrated cards I've ever seen. So when I ordered this assortment I was hoping to get a nice selection of cards I could use. Some of them are really cute but I thought that a good portion of the birthday cards were kind of insulting. Talking about white hair and whiskers and getting old and you're how old? I don't want to give out cards like that myself. Maybe some people find those kind funny but I didn't like them. The thank you card and just checking in type cards were fine. Now don't get me wrong, there were a couple of birthday cards that were cute and nice but I used those up quickly and now I am stuck with all these cards I don't like. So now I am on Amazon looking for another box of birthday cards. From now on I think I will order my Leanin' tree cards individually."
4,Good clock that makes announcements about current time,"Clock that makes vocal announcements of current time, in a female voice, either by an automatic setting or manually by pressing a button on top of the unit. Would be great if the clock would announce, ""You have a meeting at <time>"", instead of just announcing the time on the hour."
1,CHEAP CLOCK T,The small digital clock worked but the face clock didn't work. The second hand didn't move at all. You get what you pay for. The clock is cheap in all aspects. The company was good about accepting a return. Unfortuantely my blind friend will get her gift that I exchanged for after Christmas.
4,Good compilation of songs,"Great compilation of songs & good performance, indispensable in collection of Momoi's music. And to top it off gift including an album of nice photos and comment book."
3,It's OK,"Informative, but I think based more for England. I liked it and will probably watch it again. Good information to know."
3,Codex Alimentarius,"Ok, I don't want to spoil any of it for you, so I will only say this.. When the video begins a man will be speaking to you about his friend who travels. Pay Attention to who FUNDS His Travel Expenses. Rewind the video if you have to. It rhymes with ""hes financed by the Marmaceutical Pompanies."" though if the actual M were a P and the actual P were a C."
3,"Fine CD ,Lame DVD","I thought the sound quality on the cd was fine. But if you're buying this for the Concerto on the DVD you should know that half the time you won't be seeing the concerto. Yes, while the musicians play you will frequently be shown statues, fountains, gardens and other pretty images that have nothing to do with the music and take up way too much time on screen.That kind of thing might fine on a tourism video which you might or might not watch once, but watching the concerto performance would have been far more interesting."
5,Sweet!!,"This cd is awesome! Underoath is a great band and this is by far their best cd yet. Buy it, if you don't then you'r missing out on a great cd! Nuf, said said now it's your turn to buy it."
2,"Not bad, but not the greatest album","I own this cd and I think the best song in the album is ""In Regards To Myself Listen Listen"", the first track, after that the other songs sound the same. Its harder than their past material, and I am not talking of ""acts of depression"" and ""cries of the past"" obviously. The pseudo break downs sound cool, but they get overdone, which make the songs sound very boring after awhile. I do not hate Underoath its just this CD, is really not as great as I imagined, and I think I am not the only one that thinks this about this cd. If you have ever heard of Norma Jean's most recent albums and Taking Back, this is how underoath sounds in this album. BAD!!! I just hope their next album, if there is going to be one, is way better than this one!"
3,"Good, but eh.....","Ok first off this is a great album.My only problems is they try to hard to be Norma Jean, Every Time I Die, and Botch rip-off's.Lately every band out there in the hardcore scene is wanting to be Converge and Botch(Ex Norma Jean, The Chariot).Now Underoath jump to the bandwagon.I'm greatful of what they've done to this album and shown that they can use breakdowns, but common....Oh and go Spencer, you've stepped it up and shown what you've done in your old band.Again not a bad album at all, but be original not like Botch or Converge....."
1,"Suprise, Suprise","Looks like someone in Underoath picked up an old Every Time I Die cd, because this album could easily have been written by ETID and nestled in between ""Last Night in Time"" and ""Hot Damn!"". Not one to break a pattern, Underoath continues to blatently copy other bands in similar genres and shapeshift themselves, passing off their plaguarism as a new product. If you turned this into your English teacher you would get a zero. Only Aaron's vocals and drumming redeem the band from being a complete failure, but in the add they lack any personallity and fail to innovate."
5,WOW!!!,Quite simply the best thing they have ever produced even better than cries of the past. Musically this album pushes so many boundaries and showcases a vast array of musical talent not only that but the lyrics are also sensational. My advice is buy this album sit back and let it take you to places you never could have imagined
3,History as Pop Culture,"""War Against the Weak"" takes American history as a facet of pop culture. While factually based, Black undermines the historical importance of eugenics and the debate. Black, a journalist by nature, is not a historian and his book should not be taken as a solely historical text. While he does cite his evidence, Black only touches the surface of Eugenic history. Ultimately, ""War Against the Weak"" was written for popular reading and is an adequate basis for those with no knowledge on the subject"
3,I just finished the book...,"...and have to say it was a GREAT READ! I'm going to keep this short, simple, and to the point; give this book a shot. I feel I've gained a very unique perspective of WWII and it's relationship to the US.I was walking out of Barnes and Nobles only a week ago as my eyes grazed over the cover of the book on a shelf. Out of curiousity, I picked it up and was immediately engrossed by the first few pages. I venture to say any American would be, too. Edwin Black provides a clear, comprehensible history of not only eugenics, but the formation of modern genetics. You will uncover a largely untold piece of American history, as unbelievable and shocking as it may be. My friends wouldn't believe me when I shared the contents of this book with them; so I challenged them to read it. I finished it in under a week and am passing my copy along to them...I'm also taking the time to write this on Amazon...the book is that good."
4,An interesting overview,"This book seems to be a fairly complete overview of the subject. Its one recurring flaw is that the text sometimes reads as if the author believes that he is the first to notice the connections between American (and European) Eugenics and the Nazis. I doubt if the author intended that, but that is still the impression sometimes left.This is a very readable book, and well-suited for undergraduate use."
2,hum hum ? another guy who believes he knows how to sing ?,"Frankly, I thought at first that the people who reviewed this album had not listened to it, but I think I got it.6 people all giving 6 stars ? Come on , Greg Nicholson, you can do better that inviting your friends to submit comments.As for the so-called music, it is not so great. A very strong feeling of already-heard ( early 90's ... ) but with no real character or creation.That is sad in a way because I think there's potential in Greg's voice and guitar. If only he wasn't trying to mimic other ( bad ) bands ...After listening carefully to this album , looking for an ""incredible"" song ( as advertised by Greg's friends) in vain, I wouldn't recommend this album."
3,Does not fit a 2001 Grand Cherokee,"This does not fit a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The top fitting is as shown, not just a typical view. The top fitting should be a standard round bush, similar to the lower fitting. This item has a horizontal bush/bar as shown to allow two bolt fitting. Had some ""fun"" removing and replacing with alternative bushing in order to fit."
3,"Nostalgic fun, but dated","If your a Dean and Jerry/early TV fan, as I am, you will see beyond the dated vaudville entertainment and grainy kinescope quality and enjoy this. Just for a chance to peer into what the early days of live TV was like makes it worth it. It's also fun to get a taste of what Dean and Jerry's stage act was like."
1,A bad book for any novice!,"From my own experience I found trying to learn from this book an extremely difficult task especially being new to programming in general. I have spent more time flipping through other books trying to make sense of what these authors have written. If you are a novice to programming I suggest something with easier reading and better explanation of the topics such as Sams, Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days as suggested by the last review."
4,Great book for beginners,This book was easy to understand. Chapters were outlined to make the process flow. Would buy from this author again.
5,A perfect compilation,"My favorite opera composer of all times is Giacommo Puccini. My prefered soprano, Maria Callas. This album is a ride through Callas' voice and the characters she brought to live. Her impeccable performance of Puccini's ""Turandot"" (In questa Reggia) and ""Butterfly"" (Un bél dí vedremo) can't be compared with anyone else's. The only defect of this compilation is that idoes not have any arias from ""Tosca"" - my favorite opera -."
3,Early Industrial Strength Cluster,"Rather ugly, very ""Industrial"" electronic soundscapes from the German duo. In my opinion, this is less impressive than the startling electronic blitzkrieg of the preceding ""Cluster"" album, which blew my socks off when I first heard it. ""Im Suden"" uses a circular fuzzed-up guitar loop/riff too hypnotic but is simply too long to sustain interest - the other tracks are innovative certainly but by no means all that interesting..."
4,Halloween at its cutest,Halloween is always fun when my family gets these cute trick or treaters to stuff full. Go out back and instead of filling their tummys full of candy we use leaves. It's a very easy to do decoration and can be done by the whole family. The best part of this decoration is not only does it clean up my yard but it puts me in the spirit of Halloween without having to go crazy on the decorations.
3,Satisfying and energetic.,"Ten is an energetic, solid, and melodic meat-and-potatoes hard rock album from Y&T. I find it to be just as good as their previous release Contagious. I've had this disc in my collection for several years. It's still cool and fun to listen to from time to time. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying. There is a total of twelve tracks on the album. All of them are listenable. Dave Meniketti does an effective job with the vocals. The guitar work throughout is also lively and good. Some of the tunes that I like are ""Surrender,"" ""Let It Out,"" and ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark."" Worth a listen."
4,solid buy,"If you like Y&T, you will like this one. It has the classic sound and guitar of old, while keeping up with the times. This CD is more commercial, which isn't always a bad thing. Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark got some radio play, which was long over due. Dave's voice was in fine form. Ten Lovers is a great song also. Overall, a good CD."
5,My favorite,"This is one of my all time favorite albums. No doubt there are better recordings out there, but for some reason I just happen to enjoy this interpretation very much. I love Bach's B Minor Mass and I now I approach his keyboard music with a whole new perspective."
4,Spectacular,"A mixture of blues, punk, and old school rock n roll come together in this great album. Songs that stand out are the classics: malibu beach nightmare, mental beat, tooting bec wreck, and until i get you. Altough every song is catchy, upbeat and memorable just like all of Hanoi Rock's music. In my opinion, this band is highly underrated and to the major population, unknown. It's suprising that bands like the New York Dolls and Guns N Roses are more recognized even though Hanoi Rocks is far superior to both. Don't let this album pass you by."
2,AMAZON MESSED IT UP!,"This isnt a critique of the album. I LOVE the ALBUM and LOVE Hanoi Rocks. Amazon messed up the songs for download. BUY THIS ALBUM in CD FORM! Dont buy the download until Amazon fixes it. Several songs are mixed between this one and Saigon Shakes, Bangkok Shocks, Hanoi Rocks. On Back to Mystery City, the download Tooting Bec Wrec is actually the song Dont Ever Leave me from Saigon Shakes and vice versa. My opinion is to BUY any and ALL Hanoi Rocks CD's and skip the downloads. I love Hanoi Rocks. I was into them big time in the 80's. Not all of their songs are good, but they have some GREAT stuff."
1,Inept and stupid,"One of the worst albums I've ever heard. These guys start not one but two songs with the drumbeat from the song Saturday Night by the awful, awful band Bay City Rollers. S-A, T-U-R, D-A-Y, Night! The playing is junior high school inept, the singing just passable. The songwriting might be impressive if it had been done by retards or monkeys, otherwise it just doesn't cut it. I can't imagine what powerfully halucinogenic drug the other reviewers were smoking, but if it can make someone find any value in this amateurish mess of an album then I want some too. All the talent is in the singers hair. Seriously, these guys make the New York Dolls look like Berklee grads. Get any of their other albums before this one. Laughable."
3,Not what I expected,Blocks out sound ok but doesnt' fix very well from top of head. Have to wear from the rear of head.
1,Old medication,"The Sodium Bicarbonate tablets were obviously old. They had crystallized and had an ""old"" taste."
5,sodium bicarbonate,I was very satisfied with my purchase on line of sodium bicarbonate. I got 1000 tablets for less than the 240 tablets I was getting at my pharmacy. I would recommend anyone taking sodium bicarbonate to get it here.
3,A good book but there are too many errors,"I think this is a good book because it contains an introduction to the most important features of relational database and then it treat all aspects of PL/SQL, but I would like to know immediately how to debug Oracle PL/SQL programs without reading 210 pages. Next to that I found many type errors in the book."
3,Multiple errors w/in the book,"I am no SQL or Oracle expert so when I needed to be creative with triggers and stored procedures I choose this book. Several of the examples and ideas in the book are usefull but I have to say that there are numerous errors with spelling, switching variable names, and definitions (i.e. section 8.7.3 meaning to explain LPAD the book uses LTRIM instead). If you don't mind taking an extra minute to figure out what was meant instead of what is written in the text, pick up the book, its an ok reference. I don't think I will use another book by this publisher."
5,A Meal to Be Shared,"I have long admired the work of this author; I have read and reread his few volumes. This year I decided I would share my pleasure with my grandchildren, and an appropriate book was among their holiday treasures. Worth reading and passing it along."
3,A simpler time...,"Once upon a time i belonged to a book club. This was one of our choices. I have been trying to pull out fragments of memory. What i recall most fondly is that E.B. White's observations were tinted with a certain innocence. Why did we become so jaded? The last 50 years have brought along a heightened level of cynicism, and it was refreshing to read a grown man's slightly nave comments.At the same time, after a while I became a bit bored with the simplistic remarks of life in the country. My own shortcoming, not the book's."
5,More satisfying than banana pudding.,"For one who aspires to write well--the most delicious book I've ever read. The words ""witty"" and ""sharp"" come to mind, but poorly describe White and his work. Maybe, no words do with any degree of accuracy and right praise."
4,an engaging thriller with compelling characters,"No Time to Hide is responsible for my getting about four hours of sleep one Sunday night. The first few chapters did a great job of hooking me into the story -- with some early twists and betrayals. I couldn't put the book down until I followed the characters, Ben and Patrice, to the end of their journey. A strong debut, one that begs a sequel."
5,The Best Reference Book in My Numismatic Library,"Russell Logan and John McCloskey have produced a gem of a book. Federal Half Dimes has taken difficult and dense subject matter and made it easy and accessible to the reader with only average understanding of the processes involved in minting early coinage. Attributions are a breeze with the plates and descriptions included in the reference.This book was obviously a labor of love, and it is easily the most used volume in my numismatic library. Its usefulness more than justifies the price- do yourself a favor and buy this book."
4,Wonderful for film buffs,"I read this entire book on a flight from London back to the U.S. When I got home, I rented/watched several of the movies mentioned by Truffaut (Rear Window, etc.) watching for the points he made. Many people don't know Truffaut was a journalist as well as a filmmaker. He was able to write as desriptively as his films were imaginative. My only complaint is that this is a book for serious film fans who have already seen the movies he reviews. If you haven't seen the films, his comments aren't referential enough to include you. But, that said, it will help you see many titles in a new way."
3,programmable but not remote control,We were a bit surprised that this robot did not come with a hand-held remote control. He has a pad on his back where you can 'record' a series of movements for him to make. He has several moves and is fun to watch. We like to try different series of moves in different orders -- mostly with an adult doing the programming to our 6-year-old's direction.
2,Need instructions!!!!,"The toy is great but parents need instructions on how to program the toy. My son is only 5 years old and relies on dad""to know everything.Craig Symons"
4,A useful contrast to the Endurance saga,"It's hard to picture any expedition more ineptly run than Scott's, but the Karluk expedition was indeed even worse. And while Scott's mistakes were exposed for the world to see, the leader of the Karluk expedition, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, was so successful in covering up his that he was lionized after his return by the National Geographic Society and no less a personage than Robert Peary. This book was written some sixty years after the fact by a survivor of the expedition, and while the execution could be better, this is an interesting tale that provides a useful counterpoint to the story of the Endurance. While Sir Ernest Shackleton, through his courage, self-sacrifice, and leadership saved every one of his men when the Endurance was crushed in the ice and sunk, when the Karluk was similarly beset the vile Stefansson left his men to die."
5,The will to live,"I purchased this book to send to my son who teaches history. I decided I would read it, first. The author was a teacher and was honored that he was selected to take this exploration voyage with so many distinguished scientists. This book will show you what the body and spirit can endure when it has the ardent desire to live; among the survivors is the Eskimo family with two children, ages eleven and three, and a cat. This happened in 1913-1914. It will make you wonder if today's people still have the endurance and the will to survive as seen in this era."
4,A fascinating book back in print!,"If you are interested in Polar survival stories, The Last Voyage of the Karluk is a must for your collection! This is a thought-provoking book on why some people survive under catastrophic conditions and others go under. Not only is it interesting to read for its own merits, but it makes a fascinating companion piece to Lansing's Endurance. Here was a ship stuck in the polar ice where things did not turn out well. Uncertain leadership, class differences, and extreme conditions led to great suffering and loss of life. The author was quite elderly when he wrote it, but the writing style is anything but antiquated. Clearly and gracefully written, The Last Voyage of the Karluk speaks with humor and pathos about a little known episode in the annals of polar exploration."
4,Wow--What a Landscape!,"(Re)evaluating Nature especially in the new millenium is a new trend in thinking about the landscape. Misrach initiates this conversation with this early book about the changing face of the American West that has been transformed into a bombed-out wasteland. Somewhat beautiful? Yes, I thin kso. He approaches the subject sarcastically serious with a proposal to turn this highly violent landscape into America's newest national park, one which I would be the first visitor. His photographs instigate new questions in landscape photography and the new definition of ""beauty"" in all visual studies. A must for any artist/architect/planner. There is a new landscape. Misrach has found it."
5,Excellent textbook for special functions,"I needed some formulas for generalized hypergeometric functions. I searched for such formulas but could not find them in more traditional textbooks. All changed when I came upon this textbook by Luke. I found everything I needed in this textbook. Given my research interests on generalized hypergeometric functions, my opinion is that this book is ""must have"" reference for everyone working in this sub-field and, possibly, for other sub-fields of special functions, too."
3,Great style,The strap at the back keeps falling down. Maybe a bucckle enclosure would have been better
3,A Good Read -- But Problematic,"I did enjoy reading this book, but the writing seemed to be ""too"" much like poetry. I would have liked more interesting facts, and less posturing to be relevant for every thought and feeling. I also did not get a good sense of Reeve's feelings regarding her sister until the middle/end of the book. If she was as crucial to Reeve's life (as she seems to infer at the end), why does it take so long for Reeve to write about her? But this is a good, interesting reading experience . . . just have patience with it."
5,A Candid and Heartwarming Memoir,"What I especially like about Reeve Lindbergh's memoir is its candid and utterly sincere tone. This is not a dusty historical treatise; it is a simple sharing of thoughts and experiences. The reader is drawn into the life of a young girl with remarkable and famous parents. We already had an idea of what it was like to live with Charles Lindbergh from the diaries of his wife, Anne Morrow. Now Reeve's book gives another view, helping to round out the picture. Along the way she presents us with snapshot images that offer glimpses into his character. Charles Lindbergh wasn't an easy man to understand; and if he is difficult for us adults to get a handle on, what was it like for his offspring? Reeve tells us in her straightforward and heartwarming manner. This book should be an essential part of any Lindbergh fan's library. I highly recommend it.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"
3,"I love Gene, who loves Jezebel.","Obviously I'd suggest the ""Voodoo Dollies"" collection to the newcomer, but this is a pretty good album as well. The title track is good, and ""Jealous"" is an incredibly catchy song and single. Yes this is kind of genreless, but alt-goth-rock with a splash of hair-metal roughly fits the bill. This being hard to find now, if you see it, don't ""Walk Away"" from it."
4,A Moving Account of Suirvival,"This interview is lovingly done by one of the sons of a couple who experienced the Holocaust, fell in love, and created for themselves and their family a new life. There are insights that are spoken for the first time to their children, and the sons give poigniant feedback on how it felt to be raised in a household where the parents lived in the shadow and suffering of their losses."
5,A Generation Apart,"As a second generation Holocaust survivor and professor of Holocaust Studies, I consider this film very well done and important for my students to see."
4,Review: Until I Return,I am using the material form the 12 things that Jesus wants every believer to know as a 12 week study for the high school group at my church. The book was great and makes for a base for great lessons. Thanks Jeff Walling for a wonderful and thoughtful book!
4,"Overall, a powerful film","I found this film to be thought provoking and visually interesting. At times it can be heavy-handed with it's tricky dialogue but the actors seem to carry it well. I was especially impressed with TJ Storm and Tracy Stone. And watching Brian White's struggle with deciding which path to go down was intriguing. I think a lot of young adults, whether from the city or not, can really relate to this film. Highly recommended!"
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!,"This movie was terrible, and I would surmise that all positive reviewers are somehow affiliated with this self-indulgent, mastabatory piece of crap. It was really, really awful. If you enjoy melodrama, poor directing or over-acting, then this is the film for you.Every moment of the film is fraught with angst with a capital ""a."" I was only happy when the main character got gunned down in the end. Don't worry-- I haven't spoiled anything. By the time it happens, you won't care either."
3,Good but not complete,"On the plus side, this book contains loads of stuff by Lewis Carroll as well as the two Alice books. Not much is of the same quality, but quite a lot is well worth having. However, be aware that the title is misleading. Quite a lot that Lewis Carroll wrote is not here, as can be seen by doing a search for books by ""Carroll, Lewis"" and comparing that with the contents. It includes some material that appeared under his real name or pseudonyms other than Lewis Carroll, but few will grumble at that. Although all the wonderful illustrations by Tenniel for the Alice books are here (albeit not always clearly reproduced), no other illustrations are included. For some works, such as The Hunting of the Snark, the illustrations commissioned by Carroll are excellent and their omission is a serious drawback. However, for all lovers of the Alice books who want to read more by the author, this is a fair and inexpensive starting point."
4,Not a bad guide,"I found this book for $5 at a used book store a while ago and figured for that price why not. It is true that a lot of the music is close but not quite. That said, it is an intermediate guitar anthology. The way The Dead play(ed) the music is beyond advanced. I enjoy playing from this book knowing that I am not playing it exactly as Bob does. I actully think this is one of the best Dead anthologies available. If I found a book that had the music as it is played I would have perfered it though. I am still searching for a complete anthology, if anyone knows where I can find it please respond to this review."
3,Artists/titles listed here.

1,"don't bother, and you can't return it",This is the worst thermometer. I can take my temp 6 times and get 6 different temps. The instructions are clear but it just isn't dependable. Why bother? And I just discovered I can't return it to Amazon.com. Don't waist your money.
2,Junk,"This thing worked for maybe the first month. It has now stopped workign properly. It reads out temps of 65. Boy, I hope my son's temp isnt running that low. We had to end up buying a different brand."
1,Inaccurate,"We both tried different positioning in our ears to get an accurate readout on this thing, probably tried it 50 times each. Never got similar readings and never higher than 96-something, which isn't possible. Coulnd't return this thing because the time limit is 30 days from date of purchase. Waste on money and time."
2,low readings,"I haven't gotten this thermometer to hit 98.6 yet. I don't think I've seen it get to 98.0. I have established baseline temperatures for my child and myself so I will know if we are running a fever. That doesn't help me much to determine our exact temperature. I'm not sure if the thermometer is defective or if this is just the way they work. I am dissapointed with this purchase, but I'm not going to return it. Too much of a hassle."
2,Not very useful,"Not really satisfied with the product. The sheets are scanned and the printouts are that of a ""fax"" quality. Some staffs are indicated with C-clef which makes playing for the less experienced players almost impossible. A bit disappointed."
5,"ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER IN NATICK, MA","I'm attempting to complete the CorningWare french white set and love the latest addition. Yeh, I know; what's so special about a loaf dish; they all do the job, right? So, in such cases, most people buy what catches their eye. The simple white, classic styling appeals to me and was definitely the primary reason for purchasing it. I'm just sorry I wasn't able to get two of them at the time (most bread recipes I've found and use usually make two loaves). Who knows, maybe I'll get another one for Christmas. ;)It arrived in very good time and my order was over $25 so the free shipping didn't hurt either."
3,Not made like the original CorningWare. It is what it is.,"It is Iron Ware. Very basic looking. Does the job. Easy clean up. Very Heavy. CAN NOT be used in microwave, on top of stove, or broiling. Just for baking, or as a seving dish. Can't let it soak in the sink to long or will craze if used for baking and not fully dried, because it absorbs water at it's base. Iron Ware last forever; just don't drop it. I thought it was the original CorningWare, not just the brand name on this version. I looked at the reviews, which were excellent, and I should have read the product description fully. My bad.I will look on the internet for the old kind. They of course will be used, but I have a number of original items, and been using them for about 38 years. None broke even though some were dropped. You can go directly from the freezer to stove top, oven, broiler, and microwave. Oh well."
5,Great book,"I knew what I was getting before I purchased this online. Easy and fun book to read. Item was shipped quickly, too."
2,a double disappointment,"This watch was given to me as a mother's day present- well actually the first one was, I now have a duplicate. In the original one the red second hand fell off. I sent it to Skagen and they replaced it. The leather bands are proprietary and you can only get them from Skagen- for 40$ each. None of the metal Skagen bands fit this watch. The battery (size 321) runs out quickly( less than a year). I keep it going for sentimental reasons and because I find it attractive, comfortable and reliable. But a high maintenance watch relationship was not what I had in mind. No one I know who wears Skagen has had this kind of trouble. It seems to be unique to this model!"
4,Great product,Bought these used and they are in good shape. Nice and strong and won't slip on the bars. Easy to remove without wrenches.
4,Doctors that treat lupus should read this book.,"Published in 1997, this volume is a result of a conference held in September of 1996. It is a collection of over 30 journal articles and poster papers. Because it is aimed at doctors, people comfortable reading medical journal articles will find its coverage of NP-SLE interesting; it's probably a bit on the technical side for most non-MD readers. Any doctor (primary care or specialist) that treats patients with lupus should read this book if they're not already familiar with it's contents. At least that's the opinion of this reviewer, who became acutely aware of the disturbing level of ignorance of NP-SLE among even well-regarded rheumatologists."
4,Reading for fun.,I bought this book just because I love words. It is the first book I have purchased of this type and am enjoying it so far. I particularly like the fact that the author lists the sources of his facts so that I have many choices of further reading should I choose to continue my quest of word and phrase origins. This book seems purely for entertainment so take it for such.
2,Not worthy of the LP reputation,"Quality materials and construction, however the top (removable) clamp does not fit properly. Because of the angle of the lip on the bracket, the two halves do not fit squarely. It's almost as if it were designed to fit a smaller diameter/gauge rod. As a result, it doesn't fit as securely as it should, resulting in slippage. When the lip of the upper clamp is engaged/locked to the lower clamp, it has no choice but to tilt at an angle. The V grooves of the top and bottom clamps are not aligned with each other. If you tighten the wing nuts with pliers, it will hold tightly. However I think something will have to give. In a word, sloppy."
1,WATCH OUT! ! ! !,"This board requires a PCI v2.1 interface.MANY computers have PCI v2.0, and WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS CARD!Plus (always a dangerous sign), their website is either down or has been closed."
1,Stick with your old card!,"This video card is primarily made for the gamer. If this term does not fit you, then DO NOT buy this card. I have had several bad experiences with it. Tech support is HORRIBLE!, and the refresth is slow. NOT A GOOD CARD. Buy a more reputable company, like ATI, MATROX, or DIAMOND."
4,A good return to form,"Following the brilliance of 'Only Forward' was impossible, as 'Spares' bears witness, but this is a great read and puts MMS firmly back on track."
2,Skip this one.,"I was given a copy of ""Spares"" as a present and really enjoyed the pace, moody characters and dark plot. So I rushed to get a copy of ""One of Us"" and, boy was I disapointed. Credit is due to the well defined characters, vivid imagery and attention to details but as the space-aliens appeared in the tired and un-mellifluous detection story I was insulted. Could movie deals have killed this writers integrity? Perhaps a re-read may change my mind but after forcing myself to read the last third of the book, instead of putting it in the trash, that change of mind will never happen."
2,Compared to William Gibson and Philip K,"But not like them AT ALL! For one thing, the writing is not on a par with that of the afore-mentioned writers. Also while the subject matter might well have been ""borrowed"" from some more famous and balanced works, it is not in any way new or inspiring.I'm getting tired of over-hyped and patently misleading book blurbs. Save your money, there are far better Sci-Fi works out there. ""One of Us"" Is dull, derivative, and pretentious. I could forgive that if it was a fun read, but it's not."
5,Super,"This is a great testament to the studio art of Franco Corelli. Although there are some exceptions, these is a great collection of arias that Franco sang incredibly well. His is a voice that has a strong, baritonish middle and a high voice that cuts through the air as a blade. Highly reccomended."
5,He's back! Better than ever!!!,"OMG! When I saw Teddy Ruxpin came back to market, I bought him as an early x-mas gift for my 6 month old daughter. I remember mine, and I loved him for YEARS! It was something I had to share with my baby girl.When I got him, I was so surprised to see how lightweight and how much smaller than my heavy, clunky teddy was.My daughter absolutely LOVES watching his eyes and mouth move. As she grows older, I know she will love the stories too. Now she sits intently and stares and giggles at him. Which is a blessing... ;)A+++ Welcome back Teddy Ruxpin!"
1,Don't even bother...,"I currently own this modem, and I am looking for something much better. I have had problems with my computer actually seeing the modem, getting the correct drivers for it, and getting it to work. The cord that comes with it is very fragile, and any movement of the cord causes my internet connection to fail. Trust me, anyone can find something better."
1,I paid for this?,"I paid for this and you shouldn't. The few times I could get online and actually stay there it was nice. Getting online, remaining online, and generally just dealing with this modem were major headaches. It's fragile (both modem and cable) and crankier than an old man with a colostomy bag and hemeroids. Actually that's the feeling you get when you own this modem. Mine came with my computer and now I'm using my husbands computer to go online and find a different modem. This one broke! CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
5,Great!,"Ryan Adams released an unheard of 3 albums in 2005. 29 was the last album, and the only solo album he did in 2005 (the other two were with his new band The Cardinals). This CD is reminiscent of LOVE IS HELL. It's very dark, poetic, brooding. There are a few standouts for me, and those are ""Blue Sky Blues"", ""Night Birds"", ""The Sadness"", ""Starlite Diner"" and ""Voices"". The whole CD is good, 9 songs, pretty short, but quality throughout!"
2,One of his worst,"I have been a fan of Ryan Adams since his Whiskeytown days, and, while I don't think any of his solo work has topped Pneumonia, I've enjoyed almost everything he's released. He puts out so much great material that I forgave him for his occassional lapses in self-indulgence (i.e. ""Enemy Fire"" on Gold) and gave him a mulligan for Rock 'N Roll because I figured his record company put him up to it. But it's hard to forgive Ryan for 29. I guess it's largely a question of taste since a number of reviewers gave him 4s and 5s and some even went so far as to call this his strongest CD, but I just don't see how 29 stacks up to his other work (Rock N Roll excluded). For me, there are only two decent tracks - Elizabeth... and Nightbirds. Two of the songs - Voices and The Sadness - are so bad that they made me cringe, 29 starts strong but ends terribly, and the other tracks just plod and meander along. In short, I would not recommend this CD."
5,He'll fly around your head for a while....,"Stan is an artist no doubt. This album was the second after the crazy/dark/magik experience with the Wall of Vodoo. A lot of expectations ($) from the record company, but it didn't sell enough. Why? Well i don't know or maybe i do but in anycase the bottom line is that Stan deserve more recognition and this album is a PEARL, i still can't live without it. Try it. Sincerely Giovanni"
3,Good idea except for one screw,"This sword was a lot of fun on Christmas morning. The kids were running around the house and it made the perfect sword fighting sounds for their imaginary battles (and mine). Unfortunately, there is one small screw that holds the battery cover on, and in my case, it quickly stripped out of the threads. Now the cover won't stay on and the batteries fall out all the time, making this cool idea lose its cool. Why didn't they just make that tiny little screw a little bigger?!"
3,Bindery error?,"Maybe it's just me and regular people don't care any more about details like if the table of contents of a book matches the book chapters or not. What does it matter if Chapter 9 just seems to be missing? ... or wait ... is it? Could have been a bindery error, but I just couldn't get past how shoddy I felt the book was and returned it Amazon. Other folks seemed to like it a lot (others not so much) so I won't slam it or give it high praise because I never spent any time with it. Hope your copy turns out to be better put together."
2,a little too cheesy for me,This will help you build your chord vocab but the progressions are pretty cheesy. Tom plays every instrument slapped on each track and the whole thing sounds canned. Many of the progressions sound like they could have been lifted from an elevator music anthology. Disappointed.
3,Disappointed...,"Disappointed after the positive reviews here. It's a very short book, only 173 pages and reads like a diary. But it's a diary that's somewhat disjointed, and jumps from one experience to another without much filler in between. To put it bluntly, it's more like a journal of his sexual conquests, and one that's not terribly interesting. Not recommended."
3,Not amazing,"The watch is functional and light. The watch strap takes a lot of effort to fasten and undo - not user friendly. Although the watch was a good price, it does not have the wow factor I hoped for."
1,Shockingly poor quality,"I had one of these a while back. It was thin, it was light. It wasn't too expensive. After a year several hour marks fell off and rattled around behind the glass. It didn't keep time all that well either. Pretty ghastly performance."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"As one of the other reviewers pointed out, the episode synopses are brief. As a matter of fact, they only cover the setup for each episode, and omit the resolution. It's like reading teasers. I was hoping for something that would actually summarize the entire episode. In that regard, this book was a disappointment, and I won't be buying the rest of the series.To be fair, the books are lavishly illustrated with drawings and black and white photos. The background material on production, and actor and producer interviews are interesting. If you're looking for *complete* plot summaries for each episode, keep looking, as this book doesn't have them."
2,Fits but not perfect,"I purchased this product to fit my Penguin Bio Wheel 200. As the details say, it fits. However, it is not like the original part: the magnet is much shorter. As such, it does not move as much water. I now have to purchase the correct part from somewhere else.Two stars because the description is not wrong but no more than two stars because the description is misleading."
2,Spoiler Alert,"This is a wonderful, gentle, sweet video of young Babar. It starts out calm and beautiful. The music and voice over is wonderful. But then, there's the shotgun death of his mother while he's riding on her back. The hunter then trains his gun on Babar, who manages to escape. My almost-3-year-old keeps asks, where's his mother? What happened to his mother? Other than this scene, and references to how when Babar thinks of his mother he's sad, I love the video. But I don't think the killing scene and reference is appropriate in a video aimed at such young kids."
3,"Allright, but could have been better","This film of Babar's rise from baby to king is all right, but certainly could have been better.. I feel it does not really do justice to the story as told in the original books (which I myself enjoyed so much as a small child). The overall quality of the production is not up to the level of the television series either, which was much better (quite good actually).The story telling lacks the charm of the originals... and there are some changes. Something that is jarring is that the characters of Babar, Celeste, and Arthur speak with their adult voices (from the series) rather early on when they are still children..The worst thing in the film is the rather horrible music.. it may well induce brain damage. Where on earth did they find the people to do THAT? Babar deserves better.Ultimately small children well probably enjoy it, but it could have been better. If the televsion series gets released to DVD, that will be something to look for."
1,Bad Choice.,"I thought Babar - King of the Elephants was a weak DVD, not particularly 'fun,' unless strife isconsidered a worthwhile way for children to spend their time. My grandchild Juliet, age 5, was distressed by the gratuitous violence in the film, and we had to turn off the DVD."
4,Good for Toddlers,"I agree with another reviewer that the scene where Babar's mother is killed is a little disturbing. However, it is still relatively mild compared to the more violent themes in the other Babar video (""Babar The Movie""). My 2-year old doesn't seem too bothered by it. Just watch it together with your child a few times to make sure they know that Babar is OK but don't make a big deal of it. The rest of the movie seems to be essentially from Babar books, strung together as a series of stories. The music is good--not fabulous but way more pleasant for adults than Barney or the Wiggles. All in all, I would recommend this for kids 2-4 years with no reservations."
2,Maybe better for older kids...,"My husband and 2 year old daughter watched this together and there were some parts that were definitely scary for her. The death of Babar's mom, a scary dream sequence and someone getting bit by a snake. She has not wanted to watch it again. She says it is scary and doesn't like it.The books seem to be on a better level for her. She prefers milder videos like, ""Maisy, ""Kipper"", ""The Wiggles"" and ""The Hungry Caterpillar""."
1,Killing of Mother??,"My two boys 2, and 4, were watching this together and they were enjoying the animals in the beginning scene, then a shotgun comes out and Babar's mother is killed right beneath him. For the next 10 minutes my kids kept asking what happened to the mom. It was very disturbing!! I couldn't believe they did that. It took me about 10 minutes to pick my jaw up from off the floor and then I shut the movie off and suggested we watch something less violent. In this day and age can we try and preserve the innocence of children. I will never be watching any of the Babar movies again, I was so disturbed by this film!"
5,Highly Entertained,"What a marvelous mix of entertainment and information on an issue I knew nothing about! Sutherland's journalistic approach takes amazing and colorful twists and turns as it lays out the inner-workings of the cookoff circuit where the players range from highly entertaining to overly competitive and crabby. I found myself dying to meet the queen of the cookoff, Diane Sparrow and wanting to cry over Cindy Shmuelling's bittersweet story. If you are interested in what makes people tick, this book is for you. As with all books worth their salt, I relished each new chapter and felt sad when it was over!"
5,A GREAT READ AND A REAL HOOT,"Who knew! Leave it to Americans to making cooking a sport, one where the freshness of a garnish can make the difference between winnng the big bucks or not. Sutherland is an apt guide of this world of competitive cooks with all their quirks. This book is not just for foodies, but for anyone the least bit interested in American pop culture. The cooks are vivid and compelling. The food ingenious to appalling. Part travelogue, food history and culinary who-dunnit, Cookoff is a winner."
2,A Distant Second,"I enjoy watching cooking contests on the Food Network, so I was eager to read this book. Unfortunately, the book does not capture the excitement of seeing the cooks in living color or touch your heart when they talk about their lives in their own words. You can't see the frustration on their faces when the cookies crumble or their radiant joy when they win. Reading that somebody smiled or the tears flowed just isn't the same. Most of all, you can't see the FOOD. Many of these cookoffs have been shown on the Food Network or Public Television, and the experience of reading about them is a distant second."
2,"Interesting, but the bad editing is distracting!","Cookoff is pretty interesting, but did anyone proofread it? If you're at all aware of correct grammar, spelling, or usage, this book will drive you nuts. So far (I'm about halfway through) I've found proper names spelled two different ways in the same paragraph, common words that are misspelled, and turns of phrase that are just wrong (for example, someone is described as ""flaunting"" a convention).If you're not someone who notices these things, it's a good read. If you are, it'll set your teeth on edge. Maybe someone will bother to run the spell-checker on it for the paperback edition..."
1,What a turkey,"I can't believe I read the whole thing. Are there two different versions of Cookoff? I don't see how anyone could call the author ""sly"". ""Condescending"" seems more accurate. Humorous? That's a laugh. I found boring stories about ordinary people using inferior processed food products brought to market by overly sensitive sponsors to create recipes that ""reinforce the most slovenly American food habits-assembling instead of cooking"". Cookoff is a turkey. Save your time and money, wish I would have."
3,A fun look at the world of cookoffs,"I loved the glimpse I was given into the cookoff world. I had a hard time keeping track of all the different contestants in the various cookoffs, but the author did a good job keeping my interest.A good read."
4,must-read for cooking contesters!,"The author is snippy and unflattering to her subjects, but she provides valuable information for anyone who wants to try their luck in a cooking contest."
3,A french fried review,Pros:+Louis is fairly easy to play and takes a reasonable amount of time for 4 players.+There are interesting decisions to make but aren't so complex as to be paralyzing.+the art and pieces are decentCons:-The rules take a while to get through (despite being pretty simple)-It doesn't excite people for some reason
3,Supplement to Wall Street M&A deals,The book is a great supplement to the subject of Valuation models and talks about in depth analysis that goes into the art of valuing a company. It actually goes in to informing the reader about the pre-merger and post-merger outcomes.....very informative and analytical!
3,Post-Merger Process Tools for Big Companies,"Having been a manager at a large company, I can see how this book would be beneficial for managers at large companies that are doing acquisitions. But from the perspective of a manager at a smaller company that is being acquired, this book was not particularly helpful."
1,Never received the product,"Would have loved to have this book from Amazon. I never received the product from them though (money was refunded later)I have managed to buy the book from a different source, and it is a great book for everyone who wants to know the world of M&A; as well as use it as a quick reference book. Recommend buying (check seller statistics before buying from Amazon though)"
5,WOW,"I was checking the spelling of the word ""similar"" in the dictionary the other day and there it was: ""simoom"" in the next coloumn! ""A hot, dry, suffocating sand-wind which sweeps across the African and Asiatic deserts at intervals during the spring and summer"" (OED). Ah, so Siouxsie!The Creatures as a band is soooo much better than she and the banshees ever were. This is soooo marvelous. She and Budgie employ a ""cafetieria style"" approach to music, something electronica and trip-hop artists alike were to d0 full-time throughout the nineties.Spanish trumpets on ""Manchild"" careen into drum loops; sampled traffic sounds swoon over siouxsie's vocals on ""speeding;"" and you are pummled with bongos on ""standing there,"" right after you are soothed by the scratchers!I already own ""Anima Animus"" by the Creatures (which I still maintain is the BEST of her oeuvre). So I guess it's time for ""Hybrids""!"
3,"Good, but not one of their better CD's","I do like this cd, and I am glad I own it for several tracks.I really enjoy ""Standing There"" with Budgie's thudering drumming.I like the smokey ""Pluto drive"" with the surreal hellish choir of multi layered Siouxsie background vocals. Her main singing is just so warm and inviting. Really memorable tune.I also liked ""Speeding"" with it's accordian like synth and clunking beat.The rest of the cd is interesting for a few listens, but I found the songs not very accessable and not really worth repeated listenings."
5,kudos to the creatures,the creatures offer sn eclectic sound snd instrumentation with thought provoking lyrics and Siouxie Sioux's distintive banshee wail. Fans of Siouxie will enjoy this. A mature offering and a unique listen
3,It keeps coming around to me.,"Yet another time I blindly bought an album and was rewarded. All I knew was that it was a Siouxsie side-project, and while it's easy to tell that it's her, this is no Banshees record. This is more experimental and less catchy. Even though ""Boomerang"" was released around the time of ""Peep Show"", it's not as pop as that album was. The majority of this I like, but after many years of listening, it's the tracks ""Standing There"" and ""Pity"" that always repeat in my head. Overall a good play for big fans of Siouxsie, others might want to stick with ""Kiss Them For Me""."
3,"some filler, but, some quality stuff too","Several of these tracks could've been relegated to single b-sides or something. The album starts to sound long and samey. HOWEVER, it's worth it, for my money, for the exotic/hypnotic exuberance of ""Fury Eyes"", the grindhouse pleasure of ""Untied Undone"" and, most of all, the stripjoint sci-fi perfection of ""Pluto Drive"", the album's highlight..."
4,It is Euphoria,"I don't know what else to say about the Euphoria series and label. The music, from hard trance to deep Euphoria, is very good. The music mixes and selections of songs are great. The only drawback to this one CD being the way Moby was mixed in the beginning - which seemed woefully off.Good cuts like ""Flesh"", ""Camels"", ""Spaced Invador"" and work from the Warp Brothers make this a terrific compilation. I liked this a bit better than the Ministry rival: ""The Annual Spring 2001""."
1,Mexican Memoir: Kindle Texts' Formatting,"This comment is not about the content of the book, which I am sure I would enjoy. It is about the extremely-poor formatting, which makes the book impossible to read. Some lines have words scrunched together and, since some of the book is in Spanish and Zapotec, it is hard to figure out. Some lines have only one word. Some letters are even backward! Since so much of the book is in other languages, the reader is reliant on the footnotes but, as they are at the back of the chapter, one has to spend a lot of time finding them. This is much more annoying in a Kindle than in a conventional book. I had expected that I might be able to highlight the text and find the footnote, but the Kindle book isn't configured that way.I won't be buying any serious academic texts from Kindle until this problem is resolved."
4,Great Album...where are the drums?,"Love the LP, did not like the production. THe original tapes are nowhere to be found from what i have been told. As a result it can be remastered but not remixed properly. The songs that appear on the boxset from this LP are far superior...just check out Devil Woman..i did not like this version but the boxset is amazing.1. Motorvatin' - the live version is better. Sebastian Bach covers this as well.2. Don't Follow Me - ok3. Visitor - great tune...left in lunacy!4. Teenangels Outsiders - ok5. Sweet Home Suburbia - ok6. M.C. Baby - great rocking tune.7. No Law Or Order - not for me..but good.8. Oriental Beat - fast, upbeat9. Devil Woman - awesome, just not this version.10. Lightnin' Bar Blues - very casual..its a Hoyt Axton cover.11. Fallen Star - nice vocals from Michael - Sebastian Bach also covered this song.Go get it...this was the 2nd studio LP..but the guy who produced it...did not like drums????"
5,"If you like Guns N' Roses, you must hear this album","Not so much to say, songs as Motorvatin' saying""I've got skin thight jeans and high heel shoes, A leather jacket and nothing to lose Gotta rock the nation, down the filling station"" are the perfect match that's why they were one of the best 80's metal bands..."
1,various ARTISTS??!! Pu-leeeeeze!!,WARNING!! This CD is a horrific fake!!Musicians/artists are NOT the ORIGINALS -- listen to these TOTALLY FAKE IMITATION MUSICIANS...!!!(Are they proud to have have their names made public?? HOW??!! I say let's go and stone 'em!!)###----> Kathy S (aka lakotakat)
1,Ick,So historically inaccurate. Read the book 1906 for a much better telling of the 1906 earthquake. I finished this one hoping the whole time it would get better...it did not.
3,Predictable,"Predictable from beginning to end. I do see more lust than love. But it's free, so not bad. I would never let my daughter read this."
3,Different time period for me.,"I give this author points for writing a crisply plotted, character driven story in a time period you don't get too many historical romances for. He's a chauffeur in her father's house and she's a suffragette."
5,Excellent,Two very head strong and independant people who clash from the first time they meet. Desire and attraction was there from the first moment however due to their very different life styles neither was going to be the first to admit that they belonged together. Mother Nature at her worst proved to them that being together no matter who you are is more important that your social status.
2,Disappointed,"This story was to be written against the backdrop of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. However, it seemed that the earthquake was an afterthought, happening more than 3/4 of the way through the book. Not only that, but I do not normally read books that have racey scenes such as this one. I downloaded the book and was unaware that this author writes this type of 'romance'. Fortunately, the book wasn't inundated with intimate scenes...there were only a few. I did enjoy reading about Grace and appreciated how she stepped out of the typical mold for high society women of that day."
1,Missed the chance for history,Very disappointing. The explicit sexual scenes contributed nothing to the story and actually detracted from it. They were merely an effort to satisfy what the author thinks readers are looking for. The basic story and the history of the San Francisco earthquake would be enough in itself and does not need 80% of the book filled with sexual supposition and tension.
4,"Good book, my daughter loves it.","This is a good, basic board book that counts to 10. What makes it special is the art, which is marvelous. My little one really latched onto the style and other kids who've read them have seemed similarly happy so the art is definitely a draw for the under 2 set.It's not quite as good as Thumpity Thump Gets Dressed, which has the saving grace of being sweet and pleasant enough that I'm not ready to scream the 500th time my daughter brings it over for me to read, but it's a very good book that the little ones seem to love.Matt"
1,Not worth the paper it's written on..,"An utterly historically inacurate peice of rubbish. Lay the facts as they are not as you wish them to be. Another Turkish perpective on Greek history. Unfortunately, ""freedom of speech"" also means ""freedom to write/print inaccuracies, faslehoods and deception""."
1,Old style propaganda,"It's always interesting to see an author of Turkish descent to write a book about Greek territories. Yet, the result was the expected one. ""Macedonia is not exclusively Greek"", ""her obsession with the truth had brought to her death threats, apparently from outraged Greeks"", ""nation-building in northern greece (Macedonia)"" etc. etc. and Karakasidu found of course protection from Anglo-Americans.Does this reminds a bit of the preparations for the Cyprus 1974 invasion?Yes! I vote 1 on this propaganda book."
3,Limited Scope,"It was interesting how Anastasia Karakasidou paid only lip service to the nearby ""dopyiaka"" villages of Drymos and Melisohori when examining the ""Hellenization"" process of the Langadha basin and in particular Assiros. For the uninformed, this book does a great job in presenting Macedonia as a Hellenic desert, populated by Greek speaking settlers only in the last 150 years. Karakasidou's microscopic studies should have been extended a simple 5km down the road. Failure to do so means that this book falls short of presenting what it's sensationalist title sets out to do."
4,WELL researched an UNBIASED,"It is interesting to see what other write for reviews based solely on their OWN BIAS and a even mentioned that the author is of Turkish origin . . . NEWS FLASH the war has been over YEARS ago! This book is very much the truth. It is hard understand the views of those who are RACIST, BIASED, and want to have us take their opinion when their do not look from the outside. I have reseached this FOR YEARS, from INSIDE and OUT and I will have to agree with this book, though some parts I do not, very few. SO if your looking to learn more about this ""territory"" read this and more. And yes I AM Greek! Proud of it everyday as I walk the streets of Athens. But ""Pride"" here goes TOO far whith more of a definition of BIAS, RACISM . . ."
1,CHEAP STUFF,"Does not look anything like the pictures. Sold by street side hawkers in India. Very bulky, ugly and poor quality."
4,Great Guitar Stand,"I ordered two of these, one for my classical acoustic guitar and one for one of my electric guitars. I've owned three other models of similar guitar stands in the past (all stolen by my little brother but one). This product is just about perfect. It's easy to assemble, sturdy, large enough for most normal sized guitars, and appropriately cushioned to protect the finish of your guitar on both the base arm and neck rest. The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because the strap up top is a bit too rubbery and not quite as soft as I'd prefer, but it definitely snaps on tight and does its job!"
4,Just what i was looking for,"I'm a bit of a minimalist so I preferred this stand over other stands with shiny chrome finish and thicker tubes. Having my guitars out in display reminds me that I need to play them more, very simple design--- easy to take out, and easy to put away."
4,Fair,"Product arrived eventually (was back-ordered) and in good condition. It seems a little flimsy upon construction, but is more stable than you would expect. The base has one very short leg to provide tilt, and the two prongs on the bottom simply stick through the base (so they are not terribly secure). The neck is adjustable with a simple screw to tighten in to secure it with pressure. Overall this does an excellent job of holding the instrument and I am pleased with the purchase. Buyers interested in display may wish to consider an A-frame instead...the securing strap and adjustable neck is a bit of an eyesore. This will stand up to some moderate jostling, but if you're anticipating a lot of it you may wish to consider something with a more secure system than the two prongs just stick in the slot at the base. If it gets jostled too much they will fall out (esp. if your guitar is not in it to weigh it down)."
4,Works great Must stay affordable!!,Can hold bass and odd shape bodies. Somewhat sturdy. Watch the torque on the friction knob!
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"It's not a complicated item so there's not too much to say other than it works well, is well made, and has no flaws that would prevent it from functioning as a standard guitar stand."
4,It's good,"It was easy to put together, it's a nice stand. My only complaint is that the part the guitar rests on isn't screwed in place so it can move about. Other than that it's a great guitar stand."
4,Nice stand,"Very easy to assemble. It tends to fall over on carpet if not sitting just right, but overall a good stand."
4,Sturdy and portable,"This stand works great for me. I can disassemble and fold it pretty quickly, and it hasn't let me down in the sturdiness department yet."
5,Does the job,"Good quality and sturdy.I'm using this with my Ibanez bass and it works great.Like other reviewers stated, it doesn't like acoustic guitars. My Silvertone acoustic wouldn't fit in the stand.I will definitly invest in more of these for my other electric guitars."
3,Won't stand on carpet,"**Update-This stand tips over with my acoustic guitar on carpet. The guitar fits it ok, it has adjustable height, but however I try to balance it, the stand tips over. I think it might be ok for an electric, or something smaller, but the back leg is too short, I guess, for a big acoustic. On a hard floor it's a little wobbly, but will stay up. That's incontinent if you want to use the stand in a carpeted room."
5,Works as advertised,"No issues at all. It's light, easy to put together. Works well with my acoustic guitar. An item like this one is great if you DON'T notice it!"
5,Groundbreaking. One of the century's best.,"A band way ahead of their time. They've got it all, powerful sound, message, and music. Excellent vocals, and expert guitar. -JohnnyLunchBox"
5,GREAT CD,"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BANDS THAT MAKE A GREAT CD, THEN A NOT SO GREAT CD. AND SO ON. THIS ONE BEING GREAT! ROCKS FROM START TO FINISH."
1,THIS SUCKS NO CD YEAT ..BEEN 1 .5 MONTHS,"ORDERD CD CANT GET INFO ON STATUS, WANT THE HELL...JUST WONDERING HOW AMAZON SELLS PRODUCTS IT DOSENT CARRY...REALY SUCKS I GUESS IL KEEPING WAITING..."
1,I Want My Money Back,"Don't get me wrong, I really like Warrior Soul...just not this album, or Chill Pill for that matter. Where is the rock n' roll? Everything is moody and slow AKA Boring. I came to rock and Warrior Soul did not deliver. Don't be fooled by these people telling you how ""amazing"" this record is, what's really amazing is how on earth this cd was actually re-issued. Art-Rock = An Excuse To Suck."
1,Nothing but noise,"This CD blows and I cannot believe it is still available. Kory Clarke has magnificent lyrics, but the music that coincides with it, is god awful. It is no wonder these guys are no longer around."
1,Remastered!!??,"When I played this, I couldn't believe how loud and screechy it was. How can they say it's remastered? Do what I just did a few minutes ago, I bought a used copy of this CD from 1990 here on Amazon for around $5.00."
1,Not widescreen as advertised,"Under description I was happy to see:# Format: Color, DVD-Video, Widescreen, NTSCWhen my order arrived, fullscreen. Fail."
4,Very good Tosca,"This is a very good rendition of the favorite Tosca, all three principals in good voice, great sound, but if anyone has looked at the cast, the gaoler is sung by somebody called Itzhak Perlman??? maybe a rare coincidence or the violinist doing a vocal cameo?? Anyway he does it nicely."
1,YIKES!,"Scotto brings a lot of emotional depth to the character...but her voice...it's horrible! Her top notes have more wobble than a bowl of Jello.Bruson's Scarpia is boring. Tosca should have killed him in the first act and been done with it.Domingo is brilliant and is the only strength in this poor reading.The sound is poor for a digital recording and the balance is not correct.The best Tosca without a doubt is Callas (De Sabata). If you have to get a stereo version , the second best Tosca is Leontyne Price (Karajan).Scotto gave me a headache...save yourselves from the same fate."
1,NO Support and poorly made,This product guide that comes with the machine worked good for about three weeks. Then it started leaking from the bumber. The unit cam with very little. It told me to install the Overhaul maintenance kit to fix the leak from the top of the tool but does not tell you what the kit is. I have tried to fix it and nothing works. Stay far away from this tool. I tried to go to the hardcore tools website and it gos to a porno site. Don't buy this piece of trash.
4,liked,I like the nailer. It worked very well. The only problem was that I had to replace the same O ring 3 times while putting down 700 square feet of 3/4 inch hard wood flooring. Not sure what was going on there.
3,"Nice tool, but watch out for the shipping charges","Bought the gun to install 570 feet of bamboo flooring and it worked flawlessly. My only gripe was the ""shipping and handling"" charge was over $50 which pushed the price up closer to $300."
3,Can use with 1 1/2 flooring with DIY modifications,"Too bad for you if you want to use this tool for 1 1/2 flooring. You are going to have to shim the plate to get it to work properly. This should have been any easy fix for the manufacturer to take care of, especially if they would have tried to use their own tool!!!"
4,Godd value for the price,"Saw this stapler , read the reviews, bought it. Worth every penny that I saved! Works just as well as the expensive models for a lot less.I have used the Bostich stapler in the past, and this one is just as good.Don't buy the staples that they recommend though (box of 5,000). They keep jamming and misfiring. Spend a little more on a better quality staple."
5,great deal!,bought this nailer based on reviews-just laid 600 sq ft of 3/4 inch white oak without a glitch-very pleased-got nails at home depot
4,great nailer for the money,"I laid down 24 boxes of Bruce 3/4"" oak planking with this and 2"" Grizzly asian staples. It never truly jammed, but sometimes when I was tired and inattentive, the staples would curl up. Came set up for 3/4"", still I had to adjust the tongue for the Bruce boards, tho easy. Mallet head loosened, had to be glued.It never had a problem on the ""last nail"", maybe because of staples. Just makes a different sound when empty. Put your foot on the side plate, firm steady swing, harder when the plank is a little bowed. Consistently accurate driving- but too shallow if you don't swing hard enough. Only big problem is not being able to put down planks close to wall. Have to face nail and/or glue those. It would be great to have another trigger to staple without the mallet.Why rent? This is a good machine. Hard to imagine doing it manually."
2,Oversize Heater,"Heater appeared to be very good quality but the overall size did not permit it use in a small bathroom. None of the product specs. gave any dimentions which would have saved us from having to return the heater. We measured the heater for any other purchasers reference. It is 41""long X 5"" deep X 7"" tall. Hope this helps."
1,Poorly designed heater,"This heater worked for about 3 months, and now the switch won't turn it on anymore.From reading other reviews, it seems like this is a common problem, probably due to the heating of an internal switch. The heater is impossible to open to try to fix it, and I can't find anything about this product being recalled.3 months of operation is way to low for $55... Don't buy this product."
1,2 Dead within 6 months,"I bought two of these heaters and the on/off switches went on both of them, rendering them useless, within 6 months."
5,Great Heater,"Depite the lack of a digital thermostat, the unit performs well. I do recommend this heater."
1,Failed in less than two months,"The heater gave a modest amount of heat, surprisingly little given its bulk. I ordered it on 7 December, and it failed on 5 February. Deadline for returns was 31 January. I'd suggest you look for a better product."
1,Scrap metal,I should have read some reviews before I ordered this a few months ago. It does very little to heat my living area even if left on for hours. I got a Honeywell Mini Tower at the same time and it's a fabulous little guy. Puts the other to shame. Don't buy the baseboard type if you want to be warm.
4,Works Great,Bought the heater two months ago to heat my Shop/Garage. Its 15 degrees F outside and the Shop is a comfortable 64. Hint - a fan in the room helps circulate the air and makes the heater that much more efficient.
2,where's the heat?,"Don't be fooled by the product description:Two heat settingsGreat for heating large roomsHigh and low heat settingsPROS: The heater is almost silent.CONS: It is rather large, and since the manual advises you to place it 3 ft away from any objects, it's like having a small keyboard in the middle of your floor. Yes, there are TWO heat settings... warm and warmer. The unit barely creates any heat for my small bedroom, so forget about it heating a large room. Since it does not use a fan, the little heat that is generated remains slightly above and in front of the unit. Maybe I have a bad unit? Probably not, because I ordered 2 of them, and they both heat the same. I'm going to have to contact Honeywell and see why it's not heating up much."
4,heats well just be careful,"We bought 2 of these for our basement the heat comes out well, it feels like real heat not like a lot of those heaters that seem to just blow hot air. Only problem I see with this one is it might be a bit dangerous if a kid or someone accidently left clothes on top of it, but with almost any heater there are risks. Also I rather have a digital temperature on it but there is still a temp dial on it where it turns off when it reaches certain degrees. I say for the money this is a very realiable heater that heats even better than that overpriced Amish/China heater we bought in an newspaper ad. (I still like to support Amish but umm that product is not the best heater)"
3,limitations,"I called the company and they said this heater cannot sit on anything except a bare floor or tiles due to fire hazard relating to the low profile.It is absolutely quiet! And for that reason, I am afraid I will forget about it and leave the house w/out turning it off.For my house it is too long to fit in most places and yet it can't heat a very large room. So knowing what I know now I would not have purchased it."
4,"Quiet, Even distribution, but a little slow","This is the same heater that Consumer Reports rated highest and a best buy. Actually, CR rated a different model (HZ519) but this is exactly the same but has knobs not digital controls and is half the price.Works great. Bought 2. keeps a 225+ Sq. Foot room (9 foot ceilings) over 70 degrees with the outside temp. under 32 degrees!Very quiet...silent!Takes about 2 hours to bring it from 55 to 70 so it's a little slow!"
1,"Worked good for the 2 months I used it last year, now it don't work.","I bought this in January and it worked good for the two months we used it. I plugged it in this year and it worked three weeks then quit working.I thought that it was a little cumbersome when I got it, but the price was right and so was the consumer reports review. I swore by it all year long after the performance during the cold months. I just wish it would last longer than three months of use.It wasn't like it was beat while in storage. I kept the original box and put it back in it when we werent using it. I got it back out this winter and it worked for three weeks, now it wont work.now is the time of year that they mark these things up, so don't wast your money on buying a heater that doesn't last."
3,Fairly Effective But Somewhat Inconvenient,"This heater appears to be well-constructed. I purchased it with the idea of warming me in my great room, and I found that it works for that purpose, but it does take a while to warm a chilled room. In a smaller room with the door closed, it heated just fine. As promised, it is completely silent. A handle would have made it easier to move from room to room, but it is not particularly heavy so, when it is not hot, moving it is not a big problem, though it's large size might make it awkward for an older person. The instructions are unclear as to how to set it to maintain the desired temperature once reached, so I have had to monkey a bit with the controls to get it right."
1,Burned but not warm,Not worth a lot of words.This heater just does not generate a lot of heat.The only time the room this heater is in gets warm is when spring comes.Expensive but useless.
2,Good while it lasts,These work great and heat a one bedroom apartment quite well. We had ours near a wall with no worries. It was quiet and after the first couple hours it would keep the place very warm. Then after a year it would stop working. All three of them I've seen used died after a year. The thermostat part would still work but the heater wouldn't engage. They're sealed in a way conventional tools won't open so we couldn't fix it. So if you don't mind getting a new one every year I would highly recommend this one.
4,takes the chill off nicely,"In slightly below freezing temps, using no central heat, we warmed a 275 sf room nicely with this model. In the great room, about 750 sf, it took the chill off, but we weren't toasty.If you want a blast of heat, get a heater with a fan. If you want a steady, silent source of warmth, the Honeywell HZ 515 works well. And at under $30, the price is terrific."
4,Quiet But a Bit Slow,"Pros:- No carbon monoxide emission (compared to heaters than use kerosene and profane fuel)- Very quiet. Even oil-filled heaters produces noises when it heats up (like somebody is frying inside).- Has a screen to prevent burns when you touch the surface- Adjustable thermostatCons:- Very slow to heat the room- Unless the air circulates in the room, the heat tend to concentrate on the side of the room where the heater is placed.- Huge footprint"
3,Very Good but Very Bad at the Same Time,"Very efficient heater and works amazingly well, but absolutely NOT for families with kids. I have three kids. I purchased two of these after reading Consumer Reports' great reviews. I wound up selling them to my senior citizen parents who have no kids at home. The grill gets dangerously hot. If a child fell into it or even touched it, they'd be in the hospital. So if you have no kids, by all means, buy these. They heat so good, you don't need to use your house furnace. But if you have kids, sorry, not for you."
2,Did not meet expectations!,Item arrived damaged however customer service was great! The response to the problem was fast. They sent us a return mailing label at not shipping expense for us and they were willing to send us a replacement overnight but we told them not to because the unit just did not heat up to our needs and expectations.
2,Heater is ok,"Heater is ok , but even with it on the highest setting i don't notice a difference in the room temp. If I sit right next to it I can feel a little heat."
4,Did not match product description.,"The unit I received, in early November 2007, did not have two heat settings. It appears Honeywell will change their product design without changing their model number.There were consumer reviews in here that also mentioned the dual heat levels, and now I can't find those reviews. But the product description still states two heat settings a total of three times."
4,A well-woven tale of Archaeology,"In terms of revealing information on the Hittites themselves, I was not impressed by the author's presentation of historical fact. However, this book does reveal an astounding image of what it took to begin to uncover the mystery shrouding this long sought after Biblical people.If you enjoy the history being made as much as the history being uncovered, I would highly recommend this book."
4,A history of Hittite archeology.,"C.W. Ceram's book is dated in places, but still an excellent account of the archeology which unearthed the ancient Hittites - one of the great empires of the near east - and allowed them to speak to us today. This is a story mainly about archeology and those who brought the Hittites alive once more. This book should be understood as such - a blend of history of both Hittites and the scholars who struggled to find them again. Those who wish to read solely about the Hittites can still glean much good information from this book, but as an addition to other works."
3,Good but not great,There just wasn't anything special. I love sailor moon thought but I just can't see why they made these. Personally I think they should have put a friends in wolfs clothing in it. Anyway it is good just not great.
2,Sailor Mars? When did she start using bubbles?,"This has the usual dubbed mistakes. However, there are two unforgiving mistakes. Besides for the Wiseman on the cover, Sailor Mars is holding a bubble in her hands. She looks like Mars, but who has ever heard of ""Mars Bubbles Blast""?"
3,This one is okay...,"Being a big Sailor Moon fan, I find it hard to put down any Sailor Moon movie. However, this tape is only okay. There is nothing special to these episodes. They are just two episodes that show how the negaverse tries to steal energy from humans and the major plot point of how Serina and Raye never get along. It's just two filler episodes. Nothing much special but, worth buying since they don't cost much."
3,no not worth it,The cover of the movie has absolutly nothing to do with the episodes! T he wise man is on the cover but there still with Queen Beryl so to me it makes no sence.
2,The Doom Phantom??,"I didn't buy this at Amazon, But I saw the series and my question is, why did they put the Doom Phantom(from the end of the series)on the cover of the box when he's not even in the episodes? Other than that it's about what you'd expect from DIC(you know...WHACK!CHOP!SLASH!)"
1,Not a good video,"These tapes aren't really revelent to the series, so if you're new to Sailor Moon, don't buy this, it won't tell you much. It's just to regular episodes where the Scouts fight Monsters and nothing important happens. If you're looking for a video that tells you something, try A Moon Star is Born or maybe Scouts Unite."
3,not exactly ground-breaking episodes,"WHO does the covers for these tapes? I could draw better than most of these. The cover shows Sailor Mars, with Wiseman/Doom Phantom in the background. What in the WORLD is Wiseman doing on the cover of 2 episodes taken from the first season? Sheesh. Anyway, if you are looking for episodes with tongue-biting action, shocking revelations about the past in the Silver Millenium, new characters (youma don't count) or misty-eye moments... You definately have the wrong tape. Don't get me wrong, these are good episodes, but they are just the average episodes that go in between the above described kind of episodes. Just your regular bad guys show up and the senshi kick their ""negabutts"". My personal recommendation for the best Sailor Moon home video to get would have to be ""Secret Identities"" I adore those two episodes..."
4,Sailor Moon-Evil Eyes...Not Good?,"I'm not sure why people are saying these two episodes don't belong with the series. The enemies were trying to gather energy for Queen Beryl and the Negaverse, while at the same time trying to get rid of the three sailor scouts. Personally I enjoyed these two episodes."
3,"Good, But Could Have Been Better.","The dubbing was really bad in this show. DiC was a nightmare for fans of this show. I think the Rubius and Jedite episodes were the only ones that were excelent in the dub. What were they thinking with Nelphlyte? Look for an auction on this video and go support Pionear. They may dub bad too, but at least we'd get the subtitled versions on the DVD."
4,It was Cool But not like the others,Hey I thought it was cool because these shows were the first ones I saw this season in the end when serena becomes princess serena is cool but I don't like how they make you think Dairien Dies why did they do that and then have him show up on the scene in a bad hair day as the bad guy now that is stupid.
4,My Reveiw,I really liked this book because I thought that it was really interesting at some parts but sometimes it was kind of boring. My favorite part was the rock ritual where Bastian got really mad and I liked the part where the went to a school meeting in the auditorium and the teachers found out that the class did not have a teacher or a substitute. My favorite charachter is Bastian because he is funny.
3,Not up to his previous works.,"Because I so enjoyed reading Fig Pudding, I was really looking forward to Ralph Fletcher's newest book. Upon reading this story; however, I feel Flying Solo is not up to par. A great plot idea, but Fletcher does not develop this idea in a ""page turning"" enjoyable way. I have used Fig Pudding with my 4th graders, but will not recommend nor read this book to them. I have worked with Ralph Fletcher on many occasions and feel he is a brilliant writer and teacher of writing. Flying Solo falls short of his extraordinary storytelling gift."
5,Flying Solo,"Opurtunity is knocking at the door of Mr. Fab (Fabiano's) 6th grade class. Mr. Fab is absent and a subsitute never arives. They end up proving that they can survive in school without an adualt. A boy is moving away to Hawaii and they have a rock richual to remember him by. to find out more about this book, read it."
2,Flying Solo,this book was about a class with ther teacher apsint and the sub dosn't show up. they disid to run the class them selves. the day goes on doing there work and they dont get cout until the end. what I liked about this book was that they dont tell a teacher. most of this booki did not like and I think it was a waist of time.
1,SO BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,SO bad i had to read this last year so dumb! the whole bookm is based on one day what the heck! a class trying to take care of eachother so dumb. I rather eat grass than read this poop
4,Flying solo review,I read this book with my reading group in school. I really loved it so much that during it I teared up a little bit. I really liked it in the beginning when it had a chapter of each character so that we were know who they are. One of the parts that I felt very sad was when Rachel stopped talking because tommy feathers died. I think every body should read this book. This book is sad and there are a little parts that are funny. I have to say thank you too my teacher for letting us use her books and getting to read this wonderful book.I encourage people to read this book and learn something from it. I am really happy I read this book.
4,Flying Solo,"Tommy feathers (a student) dies and Rachel (main character) stops talking. No teacher or sub shows up and the class runs it on there own. The class gets caught. It's a sad story from kids dying and its heart breaking to read this book, this is why I like this book."
3,Flying Solo,"I give Flying Solo three stars. The book was full of pandemonium. The book was about sixth-grade kids that have the best teacher, Mr. Fabiano. One day he doesn't show up and the kids find themselves without a teacher!They don't care; they take a vote and see who gets to be the teacher. I think everybody would like to have a day without a teacher.I would recommend this book to nine-twelve year old kids, boys and girls. I like how the book was so descriptive. What I didn't like when something big happened they didn't make a big deal out of it."
4,Flying solo,This was a great book that made you feel as if you were the charectar in it. It was also a unique way of writing
4,Flying Solo review,Flying Solo is the best book I've read in about a year! My favorite part of the book is when they do the rock ritual and Bastian gets really mad. But it is really hard to understand unless you've had a man or woman that admires you and then dies suddenly. I thought that the way Christopher acted was very rude but it is still a good book. It is a really good book and I would recommend Flying Solo to anyone who wants to read a quick story.
5,Awesome,"Amazing book we are reading it in class and I already know wat is gonna happen so I can just count on it to happen.since I am a very good reader I read this in 12 minutes!!I hope u like, I mean love, this book!!! (:"
3,Poorly Written,"While the subject matter of this book is intriguing, it is poorly written. Kingdon continues to make the same points over and over and over and over. His sentence phrasing and choice of diction lull you to sleep. This man could have benefitted from taking an intro level English course, or an editor who cared. Once I got through the book, though, I did take his thoughts into consideration. But he could have condensed his thoughts into a few pages."
2,Only a few that were truly good,Chillout series is better than this humdrum compilation. There were only a few that I would recommend out of these 2 discs. More out than chill!
2,"Started Promising, headed downhill","I've read Mickee Madden's work before and so I looked forward to trying this book --The story started well, although you occassionally ask yourself where she is going, but confident that she will tie things up for you neatly in the end. Unfortunately, she doesn't. You find that the person who you think is the heroine, gets less than 10% of the story in the last 50 pages. I think what bothered me the most is that Ms Madden makes the rules of her ""world"" but then doesn't follow them....Danielle should not have been able to leave Kiernan, but does, Tane should not have been able to make Alice his life mate without the ""hunger"" but he does simply by feeling rage....only a few examples of many.My advice to Ms Madden and her editors -- rework the last half of this book. You have an interesting premise, but you didn't follow through."
3,Sung in German,"Just so the song listings don't mislead:This is sung in German, not in English nor in French."
3,Open Up And Say Glam,"Although they are usually lumped in with the 80's era glam metal acts,Hanoi Rocks were more rock n' roll than metal, and closer to glam's early to mid seventies roots (New York Dolls,Johnny Thunders solo,T. Rex all come to mind)than their eighties brethren (Motley Crue,Poison etc.),who they probably influenced (more look and attitude wise)somewhat; and at times you can hear the coming of Guns N' Roses(who again were more metallish than Hanoi) in their music.There is also a late 70's punk element to their music,so it's not as outwardly commercial as you would expect from an 80's group with this type of look.Their debut is interesting,rockin' and loose, and at times refreshing,though not as essential as a Dolls or T. Rex album. Not a bad edition to your collection overall."
2,not up to Liddel Hart's usual level,"I will start by saying Liddel Hart is my favorite military historian/author and I own half a dozen books by him, and regard them as gospel. However I felt that Liddel Hart was not as well versed in this area as he is in European History. He lets his ingrained contrariness run away with him. He wants to create a ""great captain"" where there is none. He also, I believe, wants to convince the reader of the genius of the ""inderect approach"" which he expounds in his excellent book ""Strategy"". However I think considering Sherman's campaign as indirect is like calling D-Day indirect because the allies invaded Normandy as opposed to Calais. ( I must admit that I am biased because I am a Lee fan) Like every other book by Liddel hart though, it is a very quick and pleasant read. I would recommend his book on Scipio as a great intro to his work."
3,Guilty pleasure,"I enjoyed this collection, far more than I expected to, but I'm a little ashamed of having enjoyed it. The writing is vigorous, the stories well-paced -- Howard Wandrei, for my money, writes much better than his more famous brother Donald --, and the plots generally preposterous in their details. Most of these stories are the kind that were called ""spicy"" back in pulp days -- lots of nudity, with the fact of the nudity but not the nudes themselves closely, even lecherously, described. Gunfights, car chases, nude girls, unmixedly evil villains, heroic rescues, more nudes, narrow escapes, and nudes. I say check it out, but don't expect timeless literature."
2,Needs a good narrator!,"This is probably the most disappointing audio book I have ever ""read."" Why the reader thought it apt to make the main character, Victor Frankenstein--who was, what, 30? 35 years old maximum?--at the end of this novel sound like a decrepit old Swiss-German professor, is beyond my comprehension. It was so distracting that it interrupted my concentration on the events described countless times, forcing me to have to rewind, listen again, rewind, listen again, .....Also, why, when everyone in the novel is European, are the only ones with non-American accents Victor and a few Irish people?This reader ruined an otherwise fascinating novel for me. If I wasn't stuck on a long drive with nothing else to ""read,"" I would have stopped it, and sent it back, and demanded a refund! In my opinion, Tom Casaletto should never be given another book-reading job again."
4,Great little spreader,"I was trying to figure out how to spread wildflower seeds, which are spread at a very low rate, much to low for any settings on my normal broadcast spreader. I saw this on Amazon and thought it looked to be worth a try. The adjustments proved to be easy, and after a bit of experimentation, the spreading of the seed proved to be very easy. It is easy to clean, since it is all plastic. I found a real useful tool!"
2,Earthway 3400 spreader,It will do the job but I was dissatisfied with the way it worked. For about the same price you can get the Scott Handgreen II #71133 which for me turned out to be a much better unit. See my report on the Scott 71133 spreader.
4,Earthway 3400 Ergonomic Hand Held Broadcast Seeder/Spreader,"This broadcast seeder/spreader works exceptionally well for my use. I had purched one of the popular ""green models"" of another brand and had to retrun it because the gears continually jammed if fine material was broadcast as it would enter the gear box. The Earthway 3400 works smoothly (no gear problems at all) and the settings are easily made with the separate adjustment mechanism. My one and only disappointment with this unit is that the hopper is much small than I expected and frequent refills are required if you use it for a good size area. I would have given it a 5 star rating if the hopper was larger. As a side issue, the shipping and delivery was extremely slow. It took something over three weeks to receive this seeder/spreader after ordering it with free shipping (combined with another order)."
3,Not what I needed,"I needed this for applying Ice Melter, product was supposed to be applicalbe for this type of use. Had to retrun, did not work for this purpose for me."
4,Best bang for the buck,"The product is cheaply made, but what do you expect for seven dollars. It worked perfectly to seed my lawn."
1,Broke After One Use.,"I simply can't find a decent hand spreader on the market. This one was one of the worst, as it broke after I had only used it once.The Scott's hand spreader is not much better.After going through several hand spreaders in the past couple of years, I just bit the bullet and bought a more expensive push-behind spreader. I recommend you do the same."
1,Broke within 25 seconds,This item looked great and felt fine in the hand- but broke literally within 25 seconds of routine use. JUNK. Stay away.
5,"Finally, a good book on swinging","Together sex goes beyond the normal informational guideline (what is soft swinging? where can you find swinger clubs) and answers the more important question of all: Why swing? The author explains the ""value of playful sex"" and gives one an inside view of chance to understand the motivations and rewards from engaging in the swinging lifestyle.As a long time member of the lifestyle, I am impressed with the amount of personal insight and candor from which the author writes. Most books on this subject are unrealistic or written by people that truly don't understand what it's like to be a part of the ""swinging life"". Ed and Dana do and this book is a must read for anyone considering the lifestyle (and should be read by a few folks already in the lifestyle)."
5,Heavenly!,"I have been a bit reluctant to express the indescribable love for this music that I have experienced until I read these other reviews. Whew! Okay, now I know that its not just me being sappy. Neil Coomer and Derrick Williams have the most powerful, pure, penetrating, spellbinding voices I have ever heard before in my life! Just fabulous and breathtaking! I have never really been in to christian music and only went to the play to appease my girl, but now, I'm looking for their music anywhere I can find it... God Bless those two fellows (though all of the musicians and singers on this CD are impressive as well)."
1,the rock and the rabbi,"I really cannot review this item as I did not open it yet. I was actually expecting a DVD, so when I received a CD I was disappointed."
5,Outstanding!,"I have seen the live performance twice now, and plan on attending again in the next 3 months. The production is outstanding - possibly the best live performance I have ever seen. Everyone I take to the show thanks me for introducing them to it, then begins spreading the word about it to their friends. The musicians are excellent, and the songs stay with me all day long. I listen to this cd over and over. Buy it. I love it. You will too."
1,dissapointed,"The title of this review says it all. I enjoy most of Lyles'material and, for that matter, Pat Metheny but on this occasion I think that Lyle must have had a bad hair day, should have stayed in bed etc. You might like the album and that's great but it did nothing for me.Nick Bower."
5,A Great modern Jazz album- Beautiful & Timeless,"Lyle Mays compositions are absolutely fabulous all albums are great.The 2 first albums are similar in character and influence very beautiful modern jazz compositions. Lyle is supported playing with the greatest musicians. The other 2 more recent albums are quite different, yet very impressive work, in particular the ""Fictionary""."
3,nice but too small,i bought this cup not realizing how small it is. with no handle it gets very hot and since it's so small you have to fill it to the top. i wish it would have been bigger because as it is i hardley use it.
2,Not accurate,"I bought this to use for my child. I had wanted to try the ear type thermometer for a while. The first two reading seemed to be correct but after that it was horrible. The readings were all over the place on multiple uses, and were not reliable at all. It is also hard to tell if the probe is positioned in the childs ear correctly. The batteries did not last long either. I do not like or trust this thermometer and am must happier and confident with the plain old stick thermometer. I do NOT recommend this product."
1,Not as good as the first!,This movie in'nt as remberable as the first Lady and the Tramp! Disney makes horrible sequels! Let me tell you 5 reasons not to get this movie!1: Tramp and Lady as no more spirit2: Corny songs3: Too much like The Little Mermaid II another BAD sequel.4: Rushed the scene where Angel and Scamp eat sphagetti.5: An easy to quess plot.Don't waste your $$$$
5,Cute Movie,"This movie is great for kids cause it teaches a lesson, very inspiring. Parents should play this movie for there kids. Enjoyable. Movie in awesome condition."
3,Another reversal of the original.,"Scamp, the only male pup of Lady and Tramp, is pretty much the bad seed of the litter. He is rebellious, and disrespectful of his father and owners. He runs away from home, and like the original, falls in love with someone from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" It took his girlfriend Angel, who eerily resembles Tramp, telling him she would give anything to have what he has, a home and loving family, to finally open his eyes to when you have it all, don't complain about it.Overall it was decent, but not that terribly great."
3,Scamp's Adventure,"This movie was good. It had cute charecters, and an okay storyline. But it wasn't as good as the 1st movie. Like most sequels, it was almost specifically made to appeal to younger kids. I would not recommend it for people who are looking for a good sequel.By the way, have you noticed that in most sequels, the main charecter's kid is always a rebel? He/she always wants to be away from their parents, and doesn't even think of them the way real kids do. I've noticed that in a LOT of sequels, such as The Little Mermaid 2, this movie, and The Lion King 2."
5,So glad this movie is on Blu-Ray now!,"This was, surprisingly, one of my favorite Disney movies when I was younger. I had the original version on VHS and when I heard that it was going to be released on Blu Ray I started counting down the days! I purchased this yesterday along with Pocahontas and Aristocats on Blu Ray.The first one that I watched was Lady and the Tramp 2, and I must say that it looked and sounded great! Brought back many childhood memories.Don't dismiss it just because it's a ""Disney Sequel"", this one's actually really good and loveable, along with the Lion King 2!"
3,Rewinding the memories,"Join Scamp as he wants to discover ""The Junkyard Dogs"". This seems to be retelling of Tramp's adventures and a message that family is the most important part of life. Love, Romance and Friendship, let Scamp relize his importance."
1,"Awful, just plain awful","I've looked at a number of the other reviews, and for the life of me I can't figure out what these people are thinking. This the by far the worst Disney movie I have seen. If you like moralistic diatribes, with no real virtues, then this is the video for you. If you care about substance, character development, songs that are 'catchy', then save your money. I was shocked and dismayed when I saw this movie. I had thought that Disney was a safe bet for my kids, boy was I wrong."
2,On second thought...it sucks.,"I wrote the review This makes me sad... Well now, I actually give it 1 and 1/2 stars. Again many things were too comical compared to the original. The animation isn't the same, and the music style...they claim to have the original music style...far from it! The music is modern! The replacement voices are horrible, especially for Lady. The new voice doesn't sound like Lady AT ALL! The voices for 2 of Scamp's sisters are horrible as well, only one of the 3 sisters has a proper voice. The only good thing about this movie is the voices for Scamp, Angel, and the junkyard dogs were excellent. I love the character Angel! She's smart and sweet. Good day, and I hope this review was helpful for you."
4,"Classic animation style, Good picture quality, Mediocre Songs","A story with the theme, ""Lost Son Parable""There's a spaghetti scene as a direct reference to the original film.Decent movie to keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours."
2,Shame on Disney,"This could have been such a good movie, but it's simply a rip off. The plot, if there was one, was so boring, my 5 & 6 year old wouldn't watch it. I fell asleep half way through, and almost fell asleep the second time I tried to watch it. The songs were not even mildly amusing. I am very disappointed because my family loves the original. Don't waste your money."
1,Pure exploitation,This is a sequel to the Original Lady and the tramp. Lady and Butch (The Tramp) have a son who wants to be a junk yard dog. This movie was made for only one reason and that is to make money. It is a complete insult to the original and the genius of Walt Disney. The songs are terrible.
1,DTV,"DTV : Abreviataion : Direct To Video.1. DISNEY : An attempt at making money by producing a sequel to a prior sucess (I.E The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc.) Sequel is most normally and/or always about the prior main characters child rebelling against rules, wanting to live life their own way. (I.E. The Lion King II, Lady and the Tramp II, The Little Mermaid II). Result is most normally a terribly bad 72 minute monster."
1,Isn't the little mermaid 2's failure a wake up call!,I'd have to my brain shrunken before I can enjoy it. The disney sequels are an insult to their masterpieces as well as to their audiences' intelligence. They must think we have brains made out of strained peas not to notice the recycling of old plots.
2,A failed attempt to match the first,"I say this sucked. It had absolutely no flavor! Lady and the Tramp was a rating of four in my eyes but this really does not match up. If you're a Disney fan get this for the shelves, but it isn't good for more than that."
1,"Campbell's chicken noodle soup, in dirt flavor! YAY!","It's a piece of dirty gum! GOO-GOO GA-GA! Oh, mr. SUN, sun, mr golden sun, please blow up the piece of dirt! MOO!"
4,Cute non-scary sequel with new characters and old,"If you've hated ""Zero to Hero,"" ""Return of Jafar"",and other made for home video sequels, this one will be a pleasant surprise. True the storyline isn't as catchy for the adult audience, but my kids love it! It's not the Saturday a.m. cartoon-type video that Disney has been selling for years as sequels or Little Mermaid stories(""Stormy the Seahorse, etc.)or those awful Pooh Learning series. The story emphasizes understanding a kid's independence and importance of having a loving family. True, the songs aren't real memorable, but the animation is good."
2,Surprising Arrogance from Disney Home Video,"In general I dislike direct-to-video animated movies from Disney Home Video. There have been only two that I can recommend. The others are just marginally acceptable. LADY AND THE TRAMP II - SCAMP'S ADVENTURE is just unremarkable and in fact leaves the viewer wondering if Walt Disney, if he were still alive, would have permitted the lack of fair play and unforgiving nature of the Scamp character. This movie almost gives the viewer a message that good guys finish last. I did not have any high expectations before I saw this movie but to see a sense of fair play being slowly chipped away by the studio that was the icon of fair play left me empty. You have to remember that this DVD is aimed at our youngest viewers who are capable of comprehending its story."
2,"Cute, but not comparable to the original.","My son has seen this once and has not shown interest in watching it again. Disappointing, since it was $25 through the Disney DVD Club. I wouldn't reccommend to anyone who loves the original. You will be let down."
1,Disney Have You Lost Your Mind's,"Really they have turn a rowmantic story to a goodguy v.s badguy.I love the 1ST Lady&the; Tramp, but the 2nd is like all Disney sequle'sIT RUINED THE 1st MOVIE!!!!Lady&the; Tramp was a masterpeace butnot any more.PLEASE DISNEY WAKE UP if theywant to make 2nd movie's make them like the 1st.If you want to spend money on renting it forget it.DISNEY HAS LOST THEIR MIND'S!!!!!!"
1,Lady and Tramp 2 - Scamps Adventure,"This is a great disappointment from Disney and an overall terrible tribute to the original. The soundtrack and songs were likely put together overnight by aging vaudeville composers and an ""I wanna be me"" adolescent girl. The music is absolutely laughable! The movie has no entertainment value to young children and would likely bore the heck out of the rebellious teens it strives to identify with.An embarrassment!"
2,BAD NEWS,"Let's see, first and most important, my children who love the original and generally enjoy the first showing of a movie, lost interest within 30 minutes. Secondly, if you want a commercialized, rehashed, poor animated, short movie that gives you a warm & fuzzy because they chant the word ""family"" then this is for you. Enjoy."
4,Cute,"I like the original much better, but this is okay for a sequel. It's a little weird that Lady wasn't in the movie that much, and that Tramp's character was a little overbearing, but for the most part it's decent. The songs aren't that similar to the original, but I personally like them. Scamp and Angel are a really cute couple and I love both of their characters. The love part of the story is in my opinion the best part. However, the dog-catcher was a disappointment. He was just goofy and stupid and not a great antagonist. But most of the characters were good. The plot is simple and predictable. The movie itself is cute and good for little kids.Overall, a decent sequel but of course not nearly as good as the original."
2,Scamp looks ashamed in his Direct-to-Video appearance,"A very unactiony, boring, flick that is only suitable for the young girls terrorizing your home! Scamp escapes from his domestic life to live free as a junkyard dog. I think in the junkyard you might have seen the DVD itself. I like The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2 better any day of the week. A campy sequel to classic Lady and the Tramp. Almost a one-star."
5,LA DAMA Y EL VAGABUNDO II LAS AVENTURAS DE SCAMP,"Nos gustó muchísimo tanto la primer película como la segunda.Buenos gráficos, entretenida, es excelente."
3,Package = good/ Quality of movie = poor.,"The condition of the disc and packaging was as advertised, but the movie itself wasn't terribly good. Unfortunately it suffers the same flaw as most sequels; falling short of the original masterpiece. The entire movie comes off as a bit silly and juvenile which is a common trait among most Disney movies produced in that time frame. Most people will complain that it is a children's movie, it is supposed to be like that. But lest we forget, Snow White was a children's movie. Sleeping Beauty, Lady and the Tramp, Beauty and the Beast. All children's movies, but they weren't ridiculous. They taught lessons in a fashion that didn't require cheap jokes and weak plotlines. The condition of the package was excellent, and unfortunately, far exceeded the quality of the package contents themselves."
2,Disney by Numbers,"As far as Disney video sequels go, it's just the same-old same-old. A lot of the original characters return for this story along with the usual assortment of new characters, all with typically pre-programmed Disney personalities. At several points in the proceedings, the characters burst into song, none of which stand out in any way. And, of course, there are the obligatory ""lessons"" which are slopped through the story like a heavy dose of molasses. The overall result is an incredibly twee offering (even for Disney), which will probably bore anyone aged any older than five. On the positive side, the animation is really quite good, especially for a video release (bearing in mind that these have much smaller budgets than the Disney theatrical releases). Buy it for the littlies (they'll love it), but don't expect something that will also work well on a more mature level,"
3,"Poorly digitized, bad metadata","Other reviewers seem to like the performance, but I'd look for an album that has been digitized better. There are just too many problems with the MP3s:1. The filenames or metadata are set inconsistently between disks. As a result, Windows Media Player won't play them in the right order. I spent a good hour with the advanced tag editor trying to correct this.2. The fourth act is incorrectly labeled as the third (I think).3. There are audible gaps between some of the tracks, e.g., tracks 4 and 5 (I think) on disk II."
3,Not as bright as I hoped,I was hoping for more output. The increase was not as much as I had hoped for but the price was fair.
2,Not that good,"One of the bulbs exploded the second day and fogged the headlight permanently; the driver's side is still okay, though (no, I never touched the glass of the bulbs). The light produced by this bulb is significantly brighter for the low beam, however, I'm not able to see any difference with the high beam."
4,Excellent book for practitioners,"This book covers a wide variety of topics related to employee selection: adverse impact, test validation, job analysis, structured interviews, setting cutoff scores, and establishing training and education requirements. The book is a great reference for practitioners who want to get the ""big picture"" about setting up a state-of-the-art selection system. Probably the greatest strength of the book is the discussion of adverse impact. The author provides some background and insight on this topic that is not found in other books. What would improve this book? More detail on each of the topics. But, overall, well written and useful."
3,2 CDs for 1,"This is another of Capriccio's 2-for-1 issues, but probably best to go for Gardiner version. For budget Gluck fans Schneider has recorded the 4 soprano Paride and Elena on Capriccio."
3,Fun Read Aloud,"Reason for Reading: I like legends, myths, tall-tales, etc. and this sounded cute.A short, cute picture book tall tale of a large little girl who lassos and rides an avalanche into town so it doesn't cause destruction. Told in ABCB rhyme, it would make a fun read aloud. The first half of the book has a Dr. Seuss feel to it with made up words but by the middle they have dropped off. This matches the story telling as the first half concentrates on the silliness and the second on the action of the story. All around over-the-top silliness throughout, then that is what tall-tales are all about. I thought it was a fun book and think that little kids will as well, especially combined with the bold, full-page, comic illustrations of Cyrus."
1,One size does not fit all,"If you are smaller than most women this will not work. If you are bigger than 5'8'' 120 lbs this will not work. Since it was not expensive I did not return it, but it was put on once and that is it."
5,Highly Recommend!,"This movie was fantastic! I saw it in an advanced screening and it really blew me away. Everyone in the (packed) theater agreed that it was a great movie. As soon as you're are able to see it, do see it! I'm waiting to add the DVD to my collection!"
4,A necessity for any Dylan fan,"The book is beautifully produced, but badly out of date (getting more so with each new album) and suffers from a certain lack of attention to the lyrics as the man sings them. Even so, ya gotta have it."
4,LIVE OR NOT LIVE,"I have this record on a UK issue LP 'Stateside 'label and I was disapointed back in those days that the recording was not live.So beware!!!!I have also another Jimmy Reed LP 'Live at Soul City'and the same here,completely devoid of any audience.I still wonder why these recordings were issued as 'live' and how can one write ,'this compilation of Jimmy Reed is a fine study of the man singing in live concert'on the sleeve? ."
5,Awesome-it is the best,"Actually, I have the album and it is the best. I have been looking for this CD for a few years and have been unable to locate one. I was hoping to find it with Amazon.."
4,"Good CD, Great Band","This is their first CD and they have improved since then. It's still a good CD, though! And they are awesome live!"
1,Give Me a Break!,"I will start out by saying that these guys are pretty tight, but their songwriting skills are terrible, just check out the song titles. The horn section is very tight and kickin', but lacks a good soloist, any big town will eat them alive. Great drummer, horn section, guitarist, BUT not so hot bass player(stuck in the ""80's), lame singers, and terrible songs. They are pretty funky, but they will never hold a candle to any funk great.If they get some direction with their songwriting, and a new singer, they may be able to create some decent songs."
3,Useful but use with caution,"This book may be useful for people who are already knowledgeable about detoxing b/c that way you can discriminate, know what to use and what not use. The book comes very close to sounding like ""holistic mumbo jumbo"" which is too bad since cleansing can be very beneficial. I would use Clean by Alejandro Junger, M.D. for first time detoxing, its more straightforward."
4,A Nice Refresher Course,"The money making tips are nothing new here; however, it's not bad to keep handy, in case of another market meltdown. Even if you happen to be ""rich"" at the present time, that could change in a hurry.The best bet is to not stray far from the path of the suggestions contained inside this book's 232 pages!"
1,A Waste,"Little more than an advertorial for Primerica Multi-Level Marketing; the subject matter is covered much better by other, more objective books on money management."
5,Gathers photos which portray early Montana life,"Evelyn Cameron left her English home to become a rancher in Montana in the late 1800s: she used her photography skills to help support her family, and captured Montana life in the process. Photographing Montana gathers photos which portray early Montana life and deserves a spot in any Montana history collection as well as in art libraries seeking examples of regional photographic talent. Excerpts from her diaries and letters include plenty of autobiographical insights."
1,A bit upsetting!,"I ordered these socks for a gag gift, principal had to kiss a pig for a reading challenge at school. Long story short I ordered theses socks thinking she has a small foot. . . They were TODDLER socks! On the Internet Amazon ad, it just said small. Since I own a pair of these, it didn't even cross my mind that they would be kids socks. No where on the ad does it say ""toddlers!"""
4,2 CDs for the price of 1,"This is a very nice set. Michael Schneider has 4 excellent sopranos led by Alexander as Paris and McFadden as Helen. Libretto in Italian, French, German, and English. 2h10 playing time. Recorded 1992."
3,Fantastic Title Track,"I can understand how people unfamiliar with Chris Rea's work might be captivated by this album - after all, the title track is terrific, and his voice is unique. But earlier albums like 'On The Beach' and especially 'Shamrock Diaries' - are better. More complex, more melodic, more everything. Check them out first."
2,Different!!!,"Would not recommend. Only one song on CD worth having."" Road To Hell 2"". Sounds horrible to a Christian butthis song is rock&roll.; As Nick Jagger said,""It's only rock&roll; but I like it"""
2,Warning: Will not play on your computer.,"Great music, but was unable to copy onto my music server. I determined that it was defective and exchanged it for another with the same results. I assume that the CD is protected so that it only plays on CD music players as opposed to computer CD drives. Unfortunate, since all of my digital listening is from my music server."
1,poor sound quality,"Was very excited to receive this music CD but the sound quality was really poor, it is full of static and barely audible. The CD and its case looks pretty fake. Truly disappointing! Have requested for returns and refunds and the repsonse from the seller was prompt and courteous."
4,Listen to the past.,"Where have you people been, this is one of the all time greatest 'rnr' albums! Pick a track and put on your earphones."
2,Leonard Cohen imitator,"The previous reviewers of this album have overlooked the similarity between the title track and many songs by Leonard Cohen. Both the lyrics, music and overal feel are blatantly derivative of work in Cohen's albums ""I'm Your Man"" and ""The Future."""
4,Great album,"Most Chris Rea albums are good. Some do not touch you in the same way as others but most are good. This variation to the usual ""The Road to Hell"" is terrific. I had not seen this one before and decided to buy it depite the fact that I had the other album (ten tracks). For mine this was one of the best buys I have made in the past six months. Fantastic music."
4,Splendid stuff!!,"My favorite Rea album, with (in my opinon) one of his strongest collection of songs. Usually you will find some ""fillers"", but I love every track, with the possible exception of the last (Tell me there's a Heaven), which is a little sappy for my taste. I was introducted to this album many years ago in a bar in Houston, where they played (no surprise) ""Texas""...this still rates as one of the best tracks on the album (along with the title track), but there are many joys to be had here....listen to ""Warm & Tender Love"" and ""Daytona"". All in all, not much to dislike here"
5,Road to Hell 649,I can't believe that I'd never heard Part #1 of Road to Hell. It's been a month and I still can't get it out of my head. It really changed thte song for me. Texas is great also.
3,Great Music - Unfortunately AAD & UNmastered since 1989.,"This is a fine Chris Rea CD. Easily one of if not his best. Why can't we get a digital remastering done on this? It may have a new release date of 2008 but, it's still the old and tired 1989 analog to analog to digital mix. Come on now, 20 years have passed so far ( I'm writing this in 2009 ) get it together over at that record label and do this recording and Chris Rea justice!"
4,Chris Rea,"Is a great album , but I thought that part one ""the road to hell "" was intrumental. but is a great singer and song writer"
2,An uninspired thesis retread,"The substantive content of this slender volume is in absolute contrast to the greatness of this monumental symphony, arguably the most imposing symphony of the second half of the 19th century. The small book still manages to be stuffed with filling, but of the wrong kind: intricate and tedious academic harmonic analyses and self-proclaimed 'controversial' findings with regard to the various editions of the symphony. Thus, despite its short length, the book overstays its welcome by failing to balance its technical minutiae with any larger musical issues such as where the symphony could proceed after Wagner or the sublime solution of Bruckner. All-in-all, it resembles an unfocussed and undigested doctoral thesis (which doubtless was its unfortunate genesis). IMHO, one of the weaker titles in the otherwise fine Cambridge Press series, and a disappointment for those hoping for a long-overdue addition to the sadly empty bookshelf on this extraordinary composer."
1,The Rhetoric of Western Thought...,"I was assigned this text book for a class on The Art of Human Communication, which is about the history of the philosophy of rhetoric. I'm a very good student, but I have a terrible time understanding this book - it's not clearly written at all. The writing is overblown and unclear, and nothing is in bold or clearly headed to make understanding the writing any easier. I also don't think it flows very well, it's hard to follow and understand. My professor has promised to change text books next semester, and I would recommend that others choose another text as well!"
3,Somewhat turgid. Meant for more highly educated philosophers,"Some interesting insights. Learned some new things. Overall a bit over my head (or not well-written?). The age of the book, it's archaic language, etc. had something to do with that."
2,"Too large - IF you have problem swallowing pills like me, don't buy these","Peppermint was suggested to me by my gastroenterologist and I'd searched for them in local pharmacy and grocery but didn't find them. I knew could probably get them at a vitamin store but didn't want to make a special trip so ordered off Amazon (my preference for online ordering). Pills arrived on time and packaged well...thing is they are too big for me to swallow. Nothing against the seller, my throat is too sore to swallow large pills and I forgot to check if they were capsules, they were not they are solid pill and too large for me. I didn't send them back but will never take them....someday they will wind up in the trash. If you have problem swallowing pills, don't get these. (They are blue and have a strange odor too)."
1,Don't recommend,I took this because it was recommended for SIBO - made it worse. I had stomach pain from taking this - stopped waste of $!!
5,Helpful for Gastritis,This product works really great for helping gastritis. Out of all the natural remedies I have tried this has given me the most success so far including over Aloe Vera. With this product I was able to stay off of a proton pump inhibitor. Please make sure you take your medication if this doesn't work for you!
1,"Stay in Business, Don't buy Quickbooks","This software is filled with all sorts of glitches. In order to fix the glitches, you must pay for ""support"", which is basically a group of esl students with tabbed notebooks. I spent hours on the phone trying to solve several problems with the program. None of them were solved, and I was still charged. I now take my laptop to the accoutant every week and struggle without it for several days while she does my books since the transfer to PC function does NOT work. Aatrix is even worse. Together, these programs have made running my business miserable."
2,Mac user- buyer beware,"Intuit has short-changed Mac users with the all new 2006 version of quickbooks. The windows version has so many more features, and for the same price it leaves you wondering why those features were left out of the mac edition. The invoices it creates look like a joke and there's no way to change it- the boxes and text are grossly misaligned and the line items butt right up against the border of the columns. The windows version however, comes with a complete ""layout designer"" built right in. As a small business owner and graphic designer I need my invoices to look professional. There are many alternatives for Mac users in terms of accounting software- try looking at MYOB for the mac or if you are in the creative industry check out Studiometry."
1,Not worth the time and hassle. Bad reviews are correct.,"Purchased dQB Pro 2006 earlier this year. Worked fine until recently when it suddenly started having problems with the ""Enter Sales receipts"" function. Program announces fatal error and crashes. No other problems; however, Intuit wants $75.00 to discuss the issue. I used the previous version with no difficulty, but Intuit's excessive support fees for correcting QuickBooks Pro 2006 for Mac bugs now have me looking for alternatives."
1,What a rediculous turd!,"I used quickbooks last year for PC, and it was OK. I upgraded to 2006 thinking I'd get a bunch of new features, and I'd be able to use it on my mac laptop instead of just my desktop PC.What a turd. This program was't ready for prime time, it isn't easy to use, it has a bunch of horrible user interface 'features', it was patently written without the involvement of an accountant, and there are tons of user restrictions that just don't make sense.The payroll service is probably the worst. I've been unable to get the payroll transactions from the online service into quickbooks for the past week because they're having some software bug issues that they can't identify.If I can find something else that isn't too expensive and that lets me input transactions easily enough, I'm switching tomorrow. Quickbooks is useless. Don't buy it."
3,No payroll without extra cost,"The really bad thing about the Mac version is that you cannot even enter payroll tranactions manually. You can create your own accounts for payroll and enter paychecks as CHK type, but you cannot create a PAYCHK type entry even if you are willing to enter the deductions manually. All my Windows data seemed to import just fine and old paychecks imported from the Windows version are visible, but there is no way to create new ones. $25/month is just too much to pay for my 2 to 4 paychecks per month. The Windows tax table update service was more like $15/month."
2,Hard to use,"I had purchase the simple start a year ago and it was easy to use, this version does not come with the flow chart system and has a lot of stuff that I don't need or want. Plus the banking doesn't work with Wells Fargo so that leave the 10 million of us banking with Wells fargo in the dark."
1,garbage,It wont run off a file share! You can't have 1 user access it over a file share or it crashes. I just wanted it to sit on my server and it was not possible. I spoke with support and they said thats the way it is with no explanation why.
4,It works for a small business with basic accounting needs.,I find the software both easy to use and powerful enough to track the finances of my small business. The invoice and customer tracking sections are especially well designed. It is an all around good product for my business.
2,Intuit needs to spend a little more on there mac version,"I am a new quickbooks user and would probably be happy with the Mac version of this if I was not using the PC version at a different job. The PC version is so much better and although Intuit claims they care about the Mac consumer, clearly this is not the case, think twice about purchasing this version.Very disappointing."
5,Spectcular twisty turny edge of your seat suspense,I loved it and have watched it again and aagaineach time i enjoy it moreexcellent from start to finish
3,Kilmer again,"Well,they ain't exactly the Lunts, but the husband-and-wife acting team of Val and Joanne-Whalley Kilmer sure do make a purty pair in this irony-drenched thriller. ""Kill Me Again"" is 1/3 of a modern ""neo-noir"" triptych of sorts by director John Dahl, who seems to have a thing for brunettes who are very bad girls (a weakness I share with Mr. Dahl). Mrs. Kilmer is the brunette fatale in this outing, hiring down-on-his luck P.I. (are there any other kind in film noir?) Val to help her fake her own ""death"" for some typically complex reasons one often finds in this genre. The usual twists and turns ensue, with the expected Great American West backdrop. Michael Madsen tackles the role of the double-crossed boyfriend with his patented Psychotic Elvis routine. Arguably the weakest entry in Dahl's aforementioned triad (""Red Rock West"" and ""The Last Seduction"" being the other two) but still quite entertaining if you're in a noirish mood."
5,Flattered Again,"John Dahl's done well to return to film noir at the tail of the excessive 80's. This is also one of Jo Ann Whalley's finest offerings, sexy and dangerous with killer eyes. Val Kilmer plays into her wiles with certain wariness. Between the desert landscape and Michael Madsen on the chase, your options are limited. At the outset danger lurks;like a million noir openings the dangerous woman shows up. From then on, there is much suspense and betrayals.The surprise ending continues to linger long after the penetrating dark eyes of Whalley burn. Scary, unpredictable turns and twists, and then escape? This is no recycling of 40's potboilers alone. These are desperate contemporary characters finely painted in noir paint."
5,Callas fan,"I bought this CD as a gift for my opera buff son, who is a Callas fan. He said the CD had some tracks that he did not have and it was a valuable addition to his collection."
5,Lisa's War,"I just read a really great book! Lisa-the main character-is a young girl living in Europe at the time of World War II. This would be fine, but she is a Jew. Lisa's best friend Susanne is not Jewish so together they want to find a way to help some of the Jews in their country. Lisa's brother Stefan is always brave and tries to find out as much as he can about the war, this makes Lisa suspicous of what her brother and his best friend Jasper are doing. She eventually finds out their little schemes so Lisa and Susanne decide to join them. Some really shocking news is told to her family and Lisa will have to be braver than ever! Will Lisa and her family survive life during World War II? Read the book to find out!- You won't be sorry!"
4,not my favourite...,it's ok...not as good as Die Gezeichneten at all. The version is quite good.Martin Pitchon
4,What kind of a freak...,Any Joker story must undergo two tests: Is the Joker funny? And is he deadly? Both tests are passed here. Joker fans might want to check this out.
2,OH! what a LAME story!,"having just reread ""batgirl:year one"" i was browsing for other titles when i saw the cover for this book, and was drawn in by the beautiful artwork.with that said, the only thing i can really recommend this book for is the artwork. it is really beautiful, and jumps right off the page!very well drawn, fantastic compositions and story boarding, and brilliant coloring! too bad the story didn't hold up!the story never really developed, and didn't seem to go anywhere! and when other big named characters showed up i got real excited.i thought their introduction would lead to something worth reading, instead was an even bigger let down when i saw how poorly they were used!the actions portrayed in this story are very out of character. and i'm still scratching my head over the useless plot!still, it makes a pretty picture book!but i'd recommend you save your money."
5,Mike Wazowski,Mike Wazowski is my favorite character from Monsters Inc AND he is one of my best buddies along with my other partner James P. Sullivan (Sulley). This is a great figure.
5,Rebellious Youth and Strange Love,"From the back cover: ""Conflict: the moving story of a brilliant, rebellious youth struggling to end the strange love that tormented him."" Eliot was an editor at TIME magazine for many years and went on to publish widely. This was his first novel."
4,Soon to blow,"This is one of the best albums since Hyphy started taking off. Hopefully he'll catch on national with the next one. Great production, better lyrically than your typical club/radio stuff. get on it"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this book is very useful for beating the initial game, and it provides sufficient info on how to catch the legendary pokemon. overall, it is a very good guide for beginners, and veteran pokemon gamers."
3,Booo!,"All the maps in this guide are from R/S which are way different, and the levels of the gym leaders and Elite Four are in different order and are at different levels then the guide says, which messed me up."
3,nintendo's is better,"Overall it was an ok guide; but the gym leader, elite 4, and pokedex was a little lacking. I also wanted to know about the jhoto and kanto pokes. I mean, if you get a national pokedex you want to know about alllllllll the pokemon not just the new ones."
2,The Winner,"Man, all I have to say is Fredrick Douglas wins. Oroonoko is a conceited noble. He is oblivious to all that is really around him. He only sees what he wants to see. What a cause to die for. Let me tell ya."
1,Phat Phlop,"This band is pretty tight. They seem to have a great overall package, but oh, wait, the songs and the lyrics are lame. This sounds like Tower of Power got together with 'NSYNC and opened a Barenaked Ladies show. If that appeals to you then go nuts."
5,Gangsta,I really enjoyed this book. K'wan kept it all the way gangsta. The ending was sad but this was the best book that I have read by K'wan. If you enjoy a good gangsta book this is one for you.
5,EVE IS HER NAME AND A GANGSTER GIRL IS HER GAME,I HAVE SAW THIS ON BOOK SHELVES AND ALWAYS PASSED IT BY. BUT I ENDED UP BUYING THE BOOK AND IT WAS OFF THE CHAIN. EVE WAS A GIRL WHO TOOK A RAP FOR A CHILD HOOD FRIEND NAMED FELON. BUT EVE AND FELON HAVE FEELINGS FOR ONE ANOTHER BUT ARE TO STUBBORN TO ADMIT IT TO EACH OTHER. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOES DOWN IN THIS BOOK YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR OWN....
5,Heart breaker Nerve wrecking,"K'wan does one hellava job with this one. All of his books are good I thought he wouldn't be able to top his book ""Gangsta"" I guess I was wrong. He switches the game up a little and shows how females get when you mess with their familyEve Panelli comes home from jail after 18 months and is right back in the streets looking for trouble. She comes home and sees that the two friends that she got locked up for is running the streets. Her love that she never wanted to tell loves her right back and together they go on the rampage of the streets. Although running to different vendetta's they both end up with the same one. Eve is faced with avenging her parents murder. When finding out who it was thats murdered her parents she goes after them by any means and doesn't care whose with her or against her.Eve and Felon both also avenges the deaths of their best friends murder.4 murders, 2 killers, who will survive and who will loose the final battle."
3,I Still Love you K'wan,I love all of K'wan's books but this one was just ok for me. It was full of action but the ending did no justice for the story. I think we should get at least one happy ending with a book by K'wan!!! I still love his writing style and will continue to support him.
3,not all that!!,"When i start reading this book i can tell right off the back that this book was written by a man. It was all over the place, very scattered.I've read much better."
2,Not his best,"After reading Hoodrat, Kwan could do no wrong or so I thought! I read this and was like WTF. This book was OK!"
2,get an editor!!!,"This is a good story, that is IF--- you can get past the hundreds of typos and grammatical errors! I was appalled that I constantly was coming across these heinous errors. Like I said... great storyline... but please Kwan, get a better editor!!!"
5,K'wan has another hot one!!!,"K'wan definitely did his thang on this one reppin for us ladies. Evelyn is the sweet young lady who just wants to be loved and made to feel like a queen,Eve is that chick that you don't wanna piss off cause she definitely will get at you and she handles her business. Eve is one of this years best. Don't sleep on Eve."
4,A must have if you love Thomas Dolby,"This is not your cleaned and polished-in a recording studio Thomas Dolby, but a more close, personal, and intimate Thomas Dolby. If you like the man and his music, you want this album. If you want polish and production, you may want to try some of his other stuff. Wow, I would have loved to have been there on his birthday when he performed this music."
1,very disappointing,i cant believe all the positive reviews for this book.it was one of the lamest biographies that i have ever read.and i speak as someone who enjoys a good hollywood biography.save your money and look elsewhere.
1,What's wrong with this picture??,"I'm stumped. This is undoubtedly one of the most boring books I've ever read. Why did I read it through to the end? I kept thinking surely she'll ""get it"". Give me a break.... Eight husbands?? Please. Get a grip."
2,"Good book, lousy proofreading","Interesting story of the life of a celebrity. However, nearly every page has at least one type and numerous pages have typo after typo. It's hard to believe a publishing company would print a book that, literally, appears not be have been proofread: words like held instead of help, mean instead of meant, 'eds' left off where required, and on and on and on. If you are a fast reader this has a tendency to slow you down a bit when you have to skim twice to get the meaning of thought after thought."
2,I Would Like to Hear the Other Side,"I seems strange to me that someone so beautiful, talented, compassionate, understanding, smart, kind, giving, etc., etc. etc., could run thru eight husbands (or was it nine?). I'd like to hear a bit of their side of the story. This can't be as all black and white as it seems."
3,All but the Waltz by Mary Clearman Blew,The book All but the Waltz is something you should read if you are interested in learning some things about Montana life from the 1880's on. You should only read this book if you have patience because it skips around a lot. The book is a lot of stories put together and don't really ever tie together. If that bothers you then you shouldn't read this book but if it doesn't then I think that you would like this book.
3,Could be better,I am an engine novice and I thought the explanations could be better and the pictures were not of a very good quality and were not really helpful or relative.
2,Worst recipe book that I own.,"If you are looking to start brewing with extract then this might work for you but don't count on the recipes making anything that is close to professional quality beers.The recipes are at some points, proposterously bad and some of the clones are just innacurate.In all I own 48 books on brewing. Many are great, some are just OK and then a few are downright bad. This is by far the worst one that I own. Common, not even giving the brewer yeast suggestions???"
2,Let down...,What started out as a pleasant experience became a bit of a let down. The foreword by Charlie Papazian gets you all geared up. The book reads well although some of the tips are questionable. The book is definitely more for the extract brewer. Some recipes look interesting and some are out there. However comments that are degrading or offensive to certain people should have been omitted. This is supposed to be a reference book not a soapbox. Overall I found Designing Great Beer (Daniels) much more useful.
5,Lots of Recipies,"The people who wrote this book had a fun time doing it! I give the book a 4.9 star rating because it seems that for a lot of the recipes, they only brewed it once before including it in the book. Therefore, there's a chance that some of the recipes have room for improvement. But like the authors say, it's never the exact same batch twice, and changing the recipe to your liking is part of the fun.Otherwise, this is an awesome resource. There are all the classic beer styles including meads, ciders, lambics, Christmas-time ales, and some yummy-looking food recipes as well. The tips are quite helpful too. But if you don't know how to brew, you should learn how to do that first (I like Papazian's The Complete Joy of Home Brewing).That's all for now."
3,Good book containing Extract recipes of many brews.,"The book is well laid out and contains a good number of recipes of extract based homebrews.The only major complain is that as an allgrain brewer, thereare only a few recipes which can interest me."
5,Lots of recipes,"I haven't made any of the recipes yet. There are so many great looking recipes in this book, I can't wait to start."
1,Recipies.... Really?,"Just a heads up.. not one of the recipies contains any information about hop bitterness in any format (IBU, HBU, AAU). Since hops are a integral component of any beer, not having any guideline for the quantity of hop in a recipe is like a cake recipe using 'some flour'. No color guidelines either.Very disappointing.Pay for the shipping and you can have my copy."
5,My all time favorite,"I've been brewing for 8 years (and judging for 3) and I return to this book time and time again. The recipes are all well checked and well thought out (something that can't be said for all recipe books). The recipes are a a mix of extract and all-grain - not a big deal because any all-grain brewer should be able to convert any extract recipe. The recipes are not strict BJCP style recipes - some are just plain good beer that crosses styles. I will say that is is somewhat dated in that it doesn't use some newly available hops and grain (e.g. Amarillo hops, brown malt). Regardless of it's flaws, it's been my favorite and I had to write a review as a ""thank you"" to the authors."
5,excellent work,"This collection of plays is another wonderful testament to the brilliant David Ives. It was recently peformed in my community to good reviews and an extended run. Excellent, Witty, and a Good read!"
2,Beware of Titles,"I suppose I should have researched this book further before purchasing it. I was tricked by the title. I assumed it was seven one-act plays about the lives of Saints, hopefully that could be performed in a church setting. Instead they are humorous, allegorical and unusual plays, but not what I thought I was purchasing."
3,A stinger-happy score,"""Stingers"" is a film score term, meaning a sudden musical jolt caused by a loud chord, usually associated with a sudden scare in a horror film. The synth-heavy action cues in this album are filled to the brim with them, and they barely form a cohesive harmonious whole. However, the more pensive brass-laden tracks showcase Isham's capability for good thematic material. Still, it can't be a good sign if an action score succeeds only upon the strength of its non-propulsive cues.Due to the immense expense of re-use fees (the amount charged by a studio to a film score distributor, sold in thousands for 15-minute music blocks) and miniscule sales of most film scores, ""TimeCop"" is only 30 minutes in length.For the curious and fans of the film or composer only."
3,Not what I thought it would offer,Good information and instruction on how to weave belts but I was looking for basket weaving for one.I can use the book for a starter on belts.
4,Like it a lot,Its instructions are good and I wanted a simple method of weaving instruction. I have it now. I am glad I bought this book.
1,Confusing!,"I spent several days going over the book. I did one of the patterns and it looked awful. I tried to troubleshoot for the problems, no information. I wanted to work up to do the pattern on the book cover (when I was better at it) and come to find out, that pattern is NOT in the book! There is a single arrow, but this is a triple and it's not the single x 3, it's more complicated than that. I wasted a lot of time on this little book. I think there are better ones out there. So I'm going to order another title and see if I can't find better directions. If you are looking to do the pattern on the cover, it's not in the book. I really want to learn, and am willing to try easier projects to work my way up to a complicated one, but these directions are confusing to me."
3,Okay Quality,The kids at my school enjoyed playing with these for one week. The low quality string did not withstand tugging if tangled. The strings all needed to be cut off and replaced.
4,Well made and very warm.,"These are so warm that I only need them on the coldest days, otherwise your hands get too sweaty."
3,Red Sox picture book,"Up-to-date, light book, full of picutres. Full of information? Not really. Worth the money? I don't think so. Quick and easy gift for a fan."
4,Delicious!,"Enjoyable! Easy-read romance. No heavy dark story here.Dylan comes home to find an old haunt in a former lover. Maddie is determined not to fall for him, again, though she can't deny what she feels when he is near. Yet Dylan claims that he has changed, and sets out to prove that the bad boy is dead, and a responsible loving man remains.."
4,A New Paradigm of Government Role in the Global Economy,"This book will conduct us the new paradigm about the meaning of globalization, with the government's point of view.The rapid growth of International Business Relationship across the nation has its own consuquences and the impact for he domestic economy.From this book we will see a number of fundamental change of the role of government, triggered by a globalization in business.we will see the challange for the economist and politician to understanding the globalization process precisely, and how to obtain a competitive advantage for the nation."
3,"If you take it for what it's worth, a decent, short read.","Granted, Coelho's novel is filled with religious reference however, the fact remains that he writes in simple, easy to follow prose and provides his readers with entertaining fiction. Don't take it seriously(unless you are one of those religious fanatics) or from a religious standpoint; enjoy this book for what it's worth."
3,Good but difficult to read,"I would say this book is not the most fascinating, but the underlying message was good. I think there comes a time where people forget about their childhood believes, and this book reminded me of them. It was a decent book."
3,Fun read,"If you do not mind the poor writing skills, but enjoy an interesting time travel concept, this book is ok"
5,Inspirational! Amazing Read!,"After reading this book, I went ahead and purchased The Alchemist. I can't get enough of his books. They are eye-opening and moving. Great reads and I wish I had known about this author earlier. I'm currently reading By the River Piedra I wept... and have 2 other of his novels waiting on hand. You won't be disappointed. He's a phenomenal writer."
4,I follow Paolo Coelho with fascination,"I give this book four stars out of my appreciation for Coehlo's body of work, although this was not one of his best. It can't compare to The Zahir, Veronika Decides to Die, Eleven Minutes or The Fifth Mountain. But I still read most everything Paolo writes out of fascination with this author's oeuvre. I no longer view his spiritual philosophy as enlightening, and can see its flaws and peculiarities, but I read him because few writers integrate spirituality with story in the way he does, and I am always fascinated with how he weaves a tale. I read this book more to understand the man than because I was enjoying or getting much out of the story. Also, I'm not sure how much truth there was to any of it, despite his claims -- girl biker gangs? Really."
4,true accounts of one man's quest,"The Valkyries is a personal account of Mr. and Mrs. Coelho's journey across the Mojave desert in California. Coelho is determined to seek the angels that are known to visit there, since he's already been advised by his teacher to do so. The only link that he depends upon is the Valkyries: a group of women that roam the desert on motorcycles and who may just have the answer to what Paulo is after. There are many surprises to unravel in the novel, and some passages will keep you thinking for a long time. The novel also expresses inner feelings and thoughts of the author and his central characters, including his wife. The personal accounts are strong and there are times when the suspense is hard to stand on!"
4,magical and poetic,"A magical adventure based in the present, this story of acceptance of true love and of following your goals to ultimate happiness is an intricate and powerful read. The poetic and passionate style is intense reading but worth it. There's almost a crescendo of activity in the middle of the book that leaves you compelled to read on. I think viewing the text ""holistically"" helps, and thinking about the metaphors will let you extract more from the book. It's not my favourite Coelho book but still, I have to admit it is beautifully written and full of hysterical passion. I would recommend it to a friend."
1,The horror! The horror!,"Never have i read anything so bad, so stupidely constructed and so well received by amateurs. You could learn more about this kind of ""spiritualism"" watching old kung-fu series on TV."
1,Couldn't hold my attention.,"This is the worst book by this author that I've ever read. He apparently said everything he had to say in the Alchemist. Rambling and self-absorbed, this tale of meeting a nomadic tribe of women on bikes failed to squeeze out even an ounce of anticipation or dramatic tension. It was like he thought just placing a few strange characters in this story was enough to create a plot."
4,I wish I could deal with my marriage the way Coelho does,"It is not a book about angels, it is a book about a relationship. Please forget the angel stuff, and concentrate yourself in the way that Paulo Coelho describes his relationship with his wife. That's all about! And I don't understand why this book is not translated into Spanish!"
2,Has gems...would make more sense on acid,"There are some great insights into the human condition, much like in The Alchemist, but this story is bizarre to the point where its bizarreness detracts from the message being conveyed.In The Alchemist the storyline served as a vehicle to convey deeper human truths, and these truths were the point of the book. In The Valkyries, the storyline itself seemed like the point. It seemed like Coelho wanted the world to know the weird magic/drugs/psychedelic jaunts he's been on; it's 187 pages ripped out of his personal journal with no real point. The deeper human truths felt like a literary afterthought.If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that first. This book would have spoiled me on the author. I'd give it a pass."
2,Not what I was expecting after reading the Alchemist,"I wouldn't suggest this book, but it could be just where I am at on my path in life. I did not find it particularly interesting or inspiring. I kept reading though hoping it was going to get better.One interesting part to me though from the perspective that it was based on events from his actual life supposedly, kind of scary actually, he was into..I will call it the ""dark side"" of things before coming over to the ""other side"" and it tells about his experience and how it led to his path to the good side. Otherwise I did not get much from the book.Oh the most positive thing I took from the book which I never thought about before is when you look up and towards the horizon it changes your view of everything vs looking slightly down or straight ahead......I guess that applies literally and figuratively also as in positive uplifting thoughts vs negative thoughts."
5,Enlightening,"The Valkyries continues Paulo Coelho's series of books on self-discovery, spiritual questing, love and relationships. It is the largely autobiographical account of Coelho's quest to speak to and see his guardian angel - as facilitated by both his wife and a mysterious group of motorcycle riding women known as the Valkyries.The path to self discovery takes Coelho through both light and darkness, and forces him to confront his own demons as well as angels. Only through self awareness, self-understanding, accepting forgiveness, breacking a pact and making a bet is he able to finally achieve his quest. The common theme of balance, unity, love and acceptance is ever present in the book, as are the threads of esotericism and the occult that really weren't in the Alchemist, but are very evident here.A good, entertaining and enlightening read."
2,Not so much,"Who knew Valkyries were such bores? I was expecting another great story with a great message such as ""The Alchemist"" but I think that book may have been Coelho's one hit wonder. This one was rambling, whiney, self-absorbed and way too full of itself."
2,Read THE ALCHEMIST instead,"After being so well-fed by Coehlo's THE ALCHEMIST, I hungrily read THE VALKYRIES. I'm not only still hungry, I'm confused. Is this book just bad, or am I somehow not ""getting it?"""
3,Among them,"Among Paulo Coelho's great books, this became the worst one.When I say ""worst"", I mean the book is good. Just don't stay on the same line as the others.If you enjoy the author, read it. If you are just trying to know his style/form, forget it. It's not for you."
2,Shallow,"Reading this book was like trying to eat tomato soup with a fork. It was full of ""deep thoughts,"" but devoid of setting or context. Who else could make Californa's beautiful Borrego Springs Desert seem bland and boring? The prose is so spare, we don't really experience the story as we should. It reads like some children's stories, full of wonder, empty of details. As for the cosmology, about seeing one's angel, the author didn't write enough of a narrative to make me care."
5,A must have for metal fans,"Highly recommended! A fun and entertaining DVD from beginning to end.Disc one has full length live performances from many of the tour's bands. Highlights include three classic Megadeth tunes, with pyro effects included, rare Dream Theater tracks, Fear Factory debuting brand new material, and high speed versions of two newer Nevermore songs along with the best singles from the second stage bands. It's a blast to watch the rabid fans in action in the crowd.Disc Two is packed with interviews, back stage footage, praks, a Pyro lesson, tour bus tours, and a tribute to Dimebag Darrell, and the Gigantour softball game featuring commentary by Mike Piazza."
4,Nice...but we all expected more,"I agree with the reviewers here...With the pedigree of bands playing here,and the dvds they have released before ( rude awakening,live at the budokan etc.) I felt a bit shortchanged by what i got here,production and performance wise...Bobafuk n Dry kill shouldnt even be here.The other bands are good,but I wish Deth had done the extended version of She wolf and we had some more songs from DT and Nevermore.Also,considering this tour was close to 4 months long,the potential for a good chunk of Bonus material was immense...like band interviews and Gear talk ( check out the ARCH ENEMY DVD..I bought it along with this and it smokes )...The only good thing on the bonus disc here is the cemetary gates cover."
4,...expected more...,"Symphony X on DVD - it's good, but where ANTHRAX ??? I think : must have for metal fans"
5,High Class Acts!!!,"Better than Ozzfest? Of course yes!!!! This tour with only high class bands, and over the top musicians!!! You can't go wrong with this!!! A must have for every metal-fan."
2,GRRRRR !! Save your money.,"I won't even mention the other bands on this DVD.Dream Theater, Nevermore are the only bands worth watching on this release. Megadeth aren't too bad but their other live DVD release is much better.I could think of 50 Nevermore songs they could have put on this disk, and they don't include the actual songs contained.Put it this way. I bought it, i watched it, and haven't again.Nevermore needs to release a dvd on their own and stop putting 2-3 songs on different compilations.I'll stick with Dream Theater Live in New York or Budakon."
5,Great Value,"Our great cat, ""Bitey"", has a malformed liver, and has to take this and another medicine every, every day. As the other tom said, this is the same medicine (same brand, even) that my vet was prescribing and supplying, but at only a little more than half the price. When your kitty needs the good stuff every day for the rest of her life, it really helps when you can get the same product for less."
2,where's big red?,"i haven't read the book,but if you have a whole chaptyer on fusaichi pegasus,who turned out to be a dud,why should i.the only animal voted among the greatest athletes in the 20th century even ahead of my idol mickey mantle,the greatest natural baseball talent we humans ever saw,was secretariat!he sprinted the belmont,with no one around him,he hit the mile at 1:34,and as the daily racing form said,into a strong wind down the stretch and hit the wire at 2:24 flat.maryland still denies him the stakes record at the preakness by two seconds.so why doesn't he appear in the table of contents."
1,Boring and poorly written,"There is a lot of information in here, but there is no ""book"" here, no point of view, no cohesive thread. Joe Drape is not really a ""writer"", so much as a gossip and regurgitator of names and dates."
3,Gossipy bathroom book.,"This is not a bad book, but it isn't going to be a dog-eared favorite, either. The main problem is that there is no continuity. The author jumps around from character to character, story to story, with no way of knowing how (or if) anything is connected to anything else. The behind-the-scenes gossip and backgrounds of the major players in Thoroughbred racing was interesting, and the writing was smooth and graceful, but I became more and more frustrated the more I read. Maybe the audience best served by this book is made up of people who like horses but only read during five minute bathroom visits."
4,Eric Stone and Christmas - a definition of fun,"If you love Eric's music, you'll enjoy this album. Rasti di Snowmon says it all."
1,Disappointed...,"It is obvious after reading this book that the author has not even heard Farrakhan speak or at least did not listen with an open mind.I doubt that the author has even been to the mosque to hear any of the ministers.If you have an opinion on the Nation of Islam, it is better to hear a speech first hand or talk directly to a member. Save your money by not buying this book."
3,Could use improvement,"I love the design of this type of brace. I have pretty chronic ankle issues and the strap system prevents my ankle from rolling when playing sports. I have used this type of brace before (from another manufacturer) and this one isn't as good for a couple reasons. 1) The materials are a little to stiff (both the straps and the laces). Mind you, this design doesnt need the materials to be stiff for support. That is all accomplished by virtue of the straps being there. The extra stiffness just makes the laces unwieldy and the fit more abrasive (ie. blisters on my achilles). 2) I think the velcro on the straps should be lower on the straps. because of where the velcro is, only a small portion of the velcro makes a connection with the other half on my ankle. The rest is left flopping in the wind above my ankles and the brace. If my foot was 2 inches wider, it would hit in the right spot. SUMMARY: it gets the job done, but not as well as it could/should."
3,The Return to Religion,"The book is too old!!!!It was printed in year 1937-the same with the year that I was born...!The paper were yellow..and crispy!!!!If I knew it's too old like this,it's rather to add some more dollars to get the new book...???So from next time I never buy old books.Old DVD is o.k. because I bought old DVD and they are good to watch.This is a good experience with old books????Good night all."
5,Fast Application to My Needs,"I enjoyed this book! SPROUT! will become part of my personal sales book library. I like sales books that don't give me 101 things to remember, in fact I found that I could use the concepts the next day at a sales call with a potential new client.My wife also read the book because she was attracted to the title, and she said she found it helpful for her own job. She is always trying to sell new ideas to her boss and colleagues at her corporate office. She found the ideas from the book very usable in promoting her more innovative ideas. I give the book a thumbs up!"
1,Terrible,I bought this with high hopes of being able to grow a plant for my younger cousin. I am a gardner myself so I was pretty excited. However the plant NEVER grew no matter what I did. To me it was a waste of money time and resources. DO NOT BUY. Get a plant from a florist or even from Home Depot- it'll be better than this piece of crap.
1,Eggling,"I've bought two of these and none of them grew! It might just be my inability to keep anything alive, but these did not grow for me."
3,Nice cheap harp,"This harp is ok to have as a spare, but I would not recommend using it to learn on. It just sits in my truck as a spare harp to mess with during lunch breaks and when I have to wait on someone. It is alright for this, but its prob better to invest another 10 dollars and get a nicer one. The Marine Bands from hohner are a favorite of mine and are perfect to learn on. Its ok for the price."
4,Works as advertised,"A very good low cost option to the more expensive versions that are, admittedly, somewhat nicer."
4,Great Mouse!,My wife has been using the v450 on here laptop and we both like it so much that she got a second one for Christmas to use on her desktop. The only reason I didn't rate it at 5 stars is that the receiver sticks out from the side of the laptop over an inch and occasionally gets bumped or snagged. I got the V450 Nano for my laptop. It has all the same features and ergonomics but the receiver is tiny and doesn't stick out.
4,Good but a tad lively,"This would be my first wireless mouse, and there is much to like about it. I'm using it with a current MacBook unibody.Due to the batteries, the mouse is a tad heavy which makes it difficult to use accurately. Nothing to be done about that, I suppose. A more significant issue is the difficulty of getting the tracking speed/acceleration right. It goes from too slow to too quick without much of a happy medium for my tastes. Eventually I got it pretty tame, but not perfect.On the other hand, the receiver is tiny and connection is simply not a problem. Tracking is very good on awful surfaces. Since I purchased it for use while traveling, this is a big plus. Awful surfaces are the rule rather than the exception where I tend to be on the road. Receiver storage inside the mouse body is definitely a big plus. Despite Logitech's suggestion that you can leave the receiver in the USB port full time, I'd strongly recommend against it unless you want a broken receiver or USB port."
5,Takes a lickin'...,"I love this mouse! I must drop it at least once a day and after about 2 years of this abuse it still works! It has actually come apart when it fell a few times, but I just put it back together, turn it on, and it works like a charm!I also tend to leave the mouse on all the time. I never think to turn it over and shut it off. I have only had to change the battery once in the entire time that I've owned it.(I don't think there's more than one battery, but since I never open it I don't know for sure).I love the feel of the mouse, it moves like I want it to, and it never fails on me. It's a top-notch product!"
5,Love this mouse,"The mouse is perfect, easy to install, and works great. Can't believe the price was so good. Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend."
4,Reliable.,"I have been using one of these devices for two years now. During that time, it has been dropped frequently and usually never turned off. Battery life is outstanding, and performance has not degraded at all during the those years of use on my HP notebook. Now I have a new MacBook Pro, and the thing works great and is still going strong.The only drawback is the lack of two additional buttons that can be programmed to go forward and backward in web browsers. If this is not a feature that you desire, then I highly recommend this mouse."
3,"Auto on/off becomes a bug, not a feature.","I've had this mouse for about four years or so and I love it. The battery life is great, it's responsive, and it feels right. The biggest problem with it is that auto on/off feature when you remove/stow the USB transceiver. After a few years it's gotten to where a slight bump of the mouse with the transceiver stowed away will trigger the auto on/off repeatedly and typically leave it on. All this switching and on time drains the battery. I think the newer models with the smaller transceiver stowed inside is a better model. Hopefully they've removed that auto on/off feature by induction because it just becomes a problem later on. I'd rather switch it on and off myself if it meant the reliability improved. Otherwise a great mouse."
2,Operates slow and glitchy with games,"If your computer is running something like a game or huge excel doc, expect a lot of glitches with this mouse. Otherwise, this seems to work fine when your computer is not doing anything complicated."
1,Inoperable,We bought 4 and none worked with XP or Windows 7 machines. Logitech took up 5 hours of our time trying to get them to work instead of replacing them right away!
5,Very good!,"Very good small mouse, super suitable for my laptop, I have bought two of them, they are reliable and stable!"
5,Changed the way I think about mice!,"I've always been careful in buying mice for notebooks. We all like portability, but often notebook mice can be too small to be usable. I'm a graphic designer, so I need to be able to control the mouse precisely.The V450 has changed the way I think of mice. It's small, but better than any desktop mouse I've ever used. In fact, my other desktop mice now seek bulky and awkward.Occasionally I have to hit the reset button to re-establish a connection with my computer (especially if the computer was running in low-power mode), but I have yet to meet a mouse where this didn't occasionally happen.The dongle on the mouse is GENIUS! When in the mouse, it powers off (which is lovely). The dongle is very small and doesn't get in the way when plugged into USB.One other thing. I'm not a Logitech plant. I just love this mouse!"
4,Logitech V450 Corless Mouse,"Small mouse, but functions like a big one. Logitech mouses give me some problems with imprecise selection (when clicking with the left button to select something, it doesn't always work -- you have to try again."
4,Great Wireless Mouse for Everyday Use,"Pros:- Comfortable for a laptop mouse.- USB receiver can fit inside the mouse.- The on/off button is convenient for power-saving purposes, but it's also nice that it can turn off by itself along with the computer.- The horizontal scrolling is very cool.- The battery indicator is very useful.- The USB receiver is smaller than others.- Laser precision tracks well on most surfaces.- I like how you can customize the buttons.Cons:- The on/off button should be larger because it is very hard to press.- I wish the software would allow me to customize the buttons to do different things depending on the program that is active at the time. Would be VERY useful!- Could be a bit larger to fill the hand more.- Would be nice if there were forward/backward buttons or some more customizable buttons.- Not perfectly precise for gaming, or maybe I just can't get used to it, but it's manageable."
5,great!,"I got this mouse about one month ago. It works great with my MacBook. I just plugged in the USB and it works. Although the instructions say you can go to the Logitech website and download software, I didn't do that since it works fine without it. I happened to get a $10 rebate when i bought it, but even without the rebate it's worth the price."
5,Mouse on my couch,"This mouse is so great. I can run it right on the uphostery of my couch. I also got the Fellowes wireless keyboard to go with it. I recommend it, because it is just like a desktop keyboard."
2,"Annoying device, button won't click consistently","The one I got was defective; I have to hit the left mouse button multiple times to get it to work, and at an odd angle to get the button to click. It is continuously annoying. I hope other folks have better success with theirs. I wish I could exchange mine, but this probably does not warrant an exchange."
1,POOR EXPERIENCE,"After buying this mouse a few month ago I was never able to get the features to work using ""set point"". I contacted Logitech and tryed every solution they suggested but nothing worked. Finally they admitted defeat, but never offered a replacement. I note on forums that there are lots of problems. Yesterday the unit failed completely when the ""laser"" quit. I am going back to anything but Logitech."
1,Why DID they use 2.4 GHz?!?!?!?,"If you have a Linksys wireless router or pretty much any wireless router in your office, this thing is buggy as heck. It feels like a standard mouse with a bunch of lint stuck in the rollers, unresponsive and clunky. Also, the roller doesn't work all that well, it's kind of slow.Maybe this thing would work good if I didnt have a 2.4 GHz wireless LAN, but Ive got a Linksys under my desk, and that is the only explanation I can think of for why this thing has such horrible performance. I cant wait to return it."
5,Just what you need,I purchased this mouse around 6 months ago and still using the same batteries. You can use the mouse from at least 10 feet from the computer and works on all surfaces. Never had any problems and don't expect to. A1 comfort and love the smaller receiver. Microsoft can learn from Logitech on how to make a quality product like this one.
1,Probably good but never received the wireless micro-receiver,"Maybe is as good as other reviewers are suggesting but I bought it from Amazon and never received the wireless micro-receiver. Complains were useless. In addition, I could not find were to buy a separate wireless micro-receiver."
1,Doesn't work with older Mac operating systems,"I bought this for my girlfriends older labtop, but the mouse does not work with it. Returning it to amazon will cost too much so I will have to try to sell it myself."
2,cordless mouse,"I did not see anywhere on the product page about it being for noteboooks, so I will have to return them. Not that the product is bad,but I need them for PC's."
4,new wireless mouse,"the wireless mouse works great.....so did the one I already had. Unfortunately, I broke the little thingy that you plug into the usb port (sorry, don't know the technical names of these things). So, instead of being able to replace that $5 thingy, I had to buy a whole new $30 mouse.....too bad....so sad.... Don't you just love technology?!"
5,So Good I bought a 2nd one,The greatest thing about this mouse is the receiver storage is in the mouse. It also works on any surface.
2,Doesn't work as well as my old optical Logitech,"I bought this particular Logitech model based on the abundance of positive reviews. The wheel on my older optical Logitech quit working so I thought I would upgrade to this fancier laser model.It loses connection too often. After 2 full days of use and frustration, I switched back to my older mouse and what a relief. It works 100% of the time. I will replace it with the same model since I know it works so well with my laptop. This may have been just a lemon, but I will not get this particular model again.P.S. This model also doesn't fit my hand as well. I have small hands and this model is slightly longer so my fingers feel like they have to stretch to reach, thus getting tired of holding the mouse."
4,Very good mouse...,"So good that I bought a second one. It has a great battery life, fits comfortably in my hand, and very affordable. My first V450 came with carrying case which proved very useful when I am on the go with my laptop. This time around Logitech left out the case but the price was still the same. Trying to cut cost Logitech??"
4,Perfect mouse,"I like this mouse and ordered based on the customers review, and I was not wrong. This is really a good mouse with so many features. Micro (really tiny) receiver and auto turn on/off when you stow receiver into bottom of mouse. I have not tested Tilt zoom and Battery stamina. I have to test these features. As its advertised battery would go last one year and Tilt button would allow to Zoom horizontal, I am sure it would do so.I found one issue that is it feel a bit heavy may be due to big (2 AAA) batteries."
3,Smaller than the average mouse,"Mouse works great! A little smaller than the average mouse, hand needs to get used to it...other than that, no problems."
3,"Works well, sets up is smoth",Mouse works great on any surface due to laser track. Set up was just plugging in USB connection and resetting mouse connection and away you go.One thing that I would have liked is a smaller mouse since it is about the same size as desk top model and the USB connection should pivot up and down in case it is hit or you leave it in and try to put it in your case. That way it will not break off.
4,"Fantastic mouse, craptastic software.","The mouse is small, but still comfortable in the hand. It feels very solid and durable (it has lasted me 2 years so far and survived a fair number of 2-3 foot drops). The buttons are responsive but not overly sensitive.The only downside to this mouse is Logitech's SetPoint software. Installing SetPoint makes my laptop unable to sleep when plugged in. It will go to sleep and then instantly wake up.Fortunately, to get most functionality out of the mouse, SetPoint isn't required."
2,Would not buy again...,"I was expecting a simillar quality as the Logitech VX Revolution, but the V450 is far behind.I would recomand to invest the additional 10 USD and get the VX Revolution."
5,Laser Mouse,This product is so simple to use.The saler was very fast and provided great service.David R.Nelson Sr.Captain US Navy Retired
3,Logitech update reminders are a nuisance,"We have three of these wireless mice in our office and they work fine. However, the all-too-frequent reminders from Logitech about possible updates are a nuisance. There are several good competitors on the market. There is no need for this annoying feature."
3,Mine had a glitch,"I liked the look and feel of this mouse and it worked fine except that I could not adjust the wheel to scroll up or down more than one like per click. I re-installed the software but that did not help.Otherwise, I liked the mouse and think that this was an isolated problem. I did return it for a refund because I found a mouse at a store that works fine."
4,excellent product but keep dongle within 2 ft of mouse,Originally I had placed the dongle in a rear USB port of my computer desktop tower which was on the floor and I was getting a very delayed response on the mouse. I was ready to go back to a corded mouse but tried using a 3' USB extension made by logitech.Now I find the mouse works perfectly. It is very responsive with the extension USB port which keeps the dongle within 2 ft of the mouse on my desk. With a laptop there would be no problem.
3,Average Mouse,"Overall, the product is average. I used this on a desktop, and sometimes when using the mouse that it is not very smooth.If you find good deal for VX Nano, I would go for it even though it's $10 to $20 more."
3,NONE,"Cannot really rate this item, I gave it to our son as a birthday gift. He is in Germany and we our in MN."
4,Get it on sale,"The laser precision is nice, but it seems the feet of the mouse are not as slick as previous ones, or as thick... I generally dont use mouse pads, so for those of you who do, you may have a different glide than me.For bigger hand people... it seems the v200 design fit better. after extended use, my pinky has been dragged on the table a lot. Maybe its the size and the new shape that my hand hasnt really gotten used to.As for carrying it around, logitech should have included a little pouch to protect it. Previous notebook mice had it, this one doesnt. I just used my old pouch, and it fits decent, but it would have been great to have that little add on, especially for the price tag it carries.Also, the battery compartment, while it reminds me of opening the hood on my car, it seems kinda flimsy.Otherwise... new technology is awesome :)"
3,Enjoyed it a lot less than I thought I would.,"Most of these short stories are very dark and strange... Not necessarily a bad thing, depending on your taste and/or mood, I suppose. I thought I would love it overall, being a huge fan of classic rock, and of reading... But for the most part, it seemed the stories were just too ""out there""! The one I found most entertaining and interesting was Pearlywhite (about some street kids and their spirit--or perhaps imaginary--guides), by Mark Laidlaw and John Shirley. But this also became increasingly weird, even freaky, as it progressed. The excerpt from Liverpool Fantasy, by Larry Kirwan, was also pretty interesting. It makes one wonder how any given decision can change life's (or lives') course(s). This is definitely a unique collection of stories, and if you enjoy dark and strange, you're sure to enjoy it!"
3,Pump the ROCK!,"This album really is pretty rockin'. I first saw them open for Zebra in Poughkeepsie, NY way back when. I talked to Tommy after their set. He was pretty amazing. I later heard some Rage and right away recognized the riffs and said that's the axe-man from Lockup. Check out ""Punch Drunk"" if you buy. If you like 80's rock/metal you will like this...I still do."
2,Whacked Grindcore superstar band,"Ex-Cradle of Filth drummer and now current member of Dimmu Borgir, Nick Barker, along with bass player Shane Embury of Napalm Death have joined in an unholy allaince to create a grindcore/ death metal, sick, side project. A genuine force on the underground music scene, they're innovative and very talented, exspecially for a band that doesn't play together on a regular basis. Do not expect to find the next Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth darkwave sounding band. This is fast paced, in your face grind from two men who have been in the business for several years. Raw and brutillay unccompromising, it is a serious suprise for even the most extreme listener."
1,Not so hot...,"Not what I expected, Really thin towel... Bought a hudge towel, really thick for the same price at costco.... wont order again..."
1,Not the best.,I bought this thinking that being a HoMedics product I could be fairly assured of quality. It doesnt work very well. It is hard to get into the proper mode (fahrenheit versus celcius) and doesn't seem to wait long enough for a true temperature before stopping.I wouldn't recommend it.
3,"Awesome designs, decent interior, tuner sucks!",Not much more to say. I have the Day of The Dead themed one. AWESOME graphics of course. The picture is upside down in relation to the guitar though which is kind of dumb. but the tuner S U C K S!!!!.Other than that...no problems.
3,Good for historical perspective,"The other reviews give a good outline of the story in this book, so I won't repeat it. I read this aloud to my children (ages 14, 12, and 8) to go along with our study of the the first century. The book really gave us a good idea on how it was to be Roman, Jewish, or one of those stuck in between during the time when Rome finally put Judea down once and for all. In that way it enhanced our understanding of the history; yet, it is not a book that you finish and feel good about. How can it be when it is set in Palestine in 70 A.D., the year Jerusalem burned? Even the victors, the Romans, had to exert so many men and so much time for such little benefit. The story is good, compelling, and draws you in, but leaves you feeling sad at the loss and the uncertain and possibly bleak future awaiting the characters. Will I read this book again when my little children study this time period years from now? Yes. But will I look forward to reading it again? No."
5,Rockabilly done right!,"This is rockabilly as it is supposed to be. Really great band, and great album, high energy and fun to listen to."
2,Beware of fitment issues...,"Even though this part was listed as fitting my car (1990 Ford Mustang GT) on both Amazon.com and the Dorman website, the mounts for the fuel pump and sender unit were too big. It was also missing the screw hole to hold the filler to the fuel tank. Lastly, the metal on this fuel tank is much thinner than the metal on the original fuel tank."
3,Just OK,It was just OK. Did a good job of portraying life in Europe at that time period. I did not feel i was up to Singer's standard
1,Waste of money!,The picture shows the color to be a blue pattern. Paid over $40 for two straps. They arrived...one was green and one was pink.I'm planning on returning them. What a waste of time.
3,Satisfied with my purchase.,"For a strap with 4 pieces of velcro, I thought it was a bit over priced. Also, I wish I could've chosen the color of the strap instead I got a black and white one when the picture is purple.However, it is more convenient than a bag and doesn't slide off the mat so overall I'm content with it."
3,Cheap material but does the job.,"Pretty cheap material and construction, made me think if I should've just made this myself. But it does the job."
3,functional but basic,"It works, but very basic. The valcro is a little large for my rolled up mat, maybe mores suitable for a thick mat."
4,"Nice strong easy to use strap, but for a single mat","Sturdy and fits well on a "" thick matt. In fact it has about another 1"" in circumference that can be used. Easy to use. Velcro fasteners make it easy to open and close and there is a generous amount of shoulder strap. I had hoped this would also work for a double set of matts. it does not.Since the color is listed as assorted, I didn't get to choose the color I wanted. Instead of the blue I got a yellow strap."
2,Not what you might expect!,"You might think you are ordering the color in the picture but you are not. You will receive what they decide to ship you. I thought I was ordering purple like the picture but received black. When they say ""Assorted"" this means you don't have a choice in the color. So if you don't care what color you receive go ahead and order it."
4,"Good strap, a little big for my mat","The strap is very nice and holds my mat very securely. The only issue I have with it is that I have to put it pretty tight on the velcro. My mat is relatively thick (I think 3/16""), and I try to wind it as tightly as possible so it's not too bulky. I think If I had a thinner mat or used the strap for my travel mat, the strap wouldn't be able to get tight enough to hold it unless I packed up the mat very loosely. Otherwise, it is very secure and looks nice."
3,Random color sent,"I like the sling but had no choice on color when I'd ordered it. I have a purple mat, and now a bright orange sling which, by the way, is really large and the velcro straps are almost too big to fit the tightly rolled mat. But it works and that's what matters."
4,"Interesting, strong performance","This curious one-act Opera Buffa is a wry little parable about assassins planning to kill the Tsar when he has his photograph taken. Andele, the photographer, is replaced by the False Angele, but the Tsar proves to be a young man who simply wants friendship, and the would-be assassin, instead of killing him, plays a tango on the gramophone, before the Tsar's official duties summon him again. Jan Latham-Konig in this 1984 recording directs a strong performance, though the dryly recorded orchestra is consigned to the background. The voices fare better, though Barry McDaniel is not ideally steady as the Tsar."
3,"Not as good as I remembered in the 70""s. It is OK tho.","Plying my Fiddle for You. I think I liked it better in the 70's. I had an old 78 and played it all the time and daughter took it somewhere and left it. I thought I would order it, just happened to think of it. I like one or two songs the best ""Filty Funky"" the best. The second one I ordered by Waylon Jennings and Jesse Coulter I really like all the songs. As good as I remember. Thanks. W. Lou Thompson"
3,"Fun, But Nothing Special","Apollo Smile is probably known more for her attempt to ride the anime wave here in the US in the late 90's and being the voice of Ulala from ""Space Channel 5"" than for her music. This 1991 album was Apollo's only big-label release and ""Thunderbox"" did appear on the ""Days Of Thunder"" soundtrack, but for the most part this album is a very mixed bag. Some tunes are catchy but not ""take no prisoners"" top 40 material. Plus there are moments when Apollo and pitch become like two ships passing in the night. As you can imagine, this album was not a smash and went into the cut-out bins rather quickly. It does have it's moments but it is not the kind of album that would have people screaming for ""Apollo Smile 2"". If nothing else, it is a curio and worth a listen for folks that remember her from the late 90's anime scene."
4,Great kids book that the whole family will enjoy!,"This is a quirky and lovely book. The text is provided by Mr. Berton and the whimsical illustrations by his daughter Patsy. My children and I read this book over the course of a summer vacation and each one, ranging in age from 6 to 11, loved it. They couldn't wait for the next chapter. The four children in the book go on an underground adventure into a magical world of strange little people.I especially loved how the brothers and sisters help each other and watch out for each other through it all.Highly entertaining."
1,doesn't work,I tried to install this product on my desktop running Windows Vista and got a message saying there is a know compatibility issue. I tried to install it on my laptop running Windows 7 and got the same message. Neither Microsoft nor Intuit were any help and the seller won't return my emails.Terrible experience all around.
5,Worth Upgrading,"Nice features, much easier to see all customer or vendor information at a glance. No longer have to go to different screens to see contact information and ledger histories. Time savings for this alone are worth upgrading."
2,On-line updates and on-line payroll don't work. E-mailing PDFs quit working. Technical support gave up.,"The title pretty much says it all.The on-line update feature never worked. Intuit's technical support couldn't figure out why and gave up. The on-line payroll update feature failed for the same reason.After 7 months of use, the E-mail Forms function quit working. The technical support representative didn't know what the PDF files were, and repeatedly had to ask for help. The final ""resolution"" was to blame my computer instead of explaining the Amyuni 1796 error.All of this has cost more than 5 hours of being on the phone with Intuit's technical support and no resolution of the software problems.I will not recommend any of Intuit's products based on their non-resolution of these software problems."
3,a useful reference,"A useful reference of tools, concepts and tactics, but most of the information was already covered in Chris Kent and Tim Tackett's other excellent books, ""Jun Fan / Jeet Kune Do: The Textbook"" and ""Jeet Kune Do Kickboxing""still, a very nice addition to any serious JKD student's library"
5,Surprisingly Engaging Story,"Barbara Cleverly takes us to post-World War I British-ruled India and introduces us to Scotland Yard's Joe Sandilands, on assignment in the seething subcontinent. Massive changes are coming to India but the British rulers are trying to hang on to their way of life. Into this comes Sandilands, who has a strange murder investigation thrust on him. Author Cleverly cleverly (sorry) shapes a dazzling plot involving the colonial British way of life as it bumps up against the exotic culture of India. To say more might spoil things, so I will only say that this is a police procedural like few others. A most satisfying book that the reader will find worthwhile. A novel that intensely conveys the sights and smells or an India that no longer exists. A most enjoyable book!"
4,interesting and fun,"I liked this book, and I am generally pretty picky. Granted, I don't know much about the country or the time period, so historical mistakes went right over my head. But the characters were fun (some were downright funny) the plot moved along pretty quickly, and the atmosphere was interesting. I am definitely reading the next book in the series."
2,"Pukka concept, disappointing execution","Barbara Cleverly has done her research, all right; this mystery is chockfull of brand names, fashion details, and exotic flavors straight out of 1920s India. Her plot is solid, her setting is a winner, and her characters are only sometimes ripped off from Kipling. It's just too bad that Cleverly didn't bother to research the actual speech and behavior of the English in 1920s India, while she was at it. If you like to think of the past as being just like today, only in fancy dress, you'll love this book (and the clunky writing probably won't faze you, either). If anachronism grates on you, but you're still in the mood for plotty mysteries with a British-Empire setting, read Michael Pearce's Mamur Zapt series instead. *Please.*"
4,Right up there,"The legacy of William Steinberg has gone into a kind of eclipse, but maybe, just maybe he's beginning to emerge.This issue goes some way toward that end. The '57 stereo sound is lovely, the Pittsburgh Symphony at its considerable best, Steinberg at his most inspired. The maestro's view is ultra-Romantic, of an older school, at a time when the dramatic thrust and elegant sheen of Paul Paray had just come on the scene with a Mercury issue that blasted preconceptions of what this work is all about.I prefer the Paray approach since it brings out far more of the dramatic and kinetic as well as the spit and shine in the work, but Steinberg's way harks back to a deeply-felt tradition. If you have Paray, Steinberg, and the excellent Wallenstein, all your Rachmaninoff Second moods will be covered.And in thinking about that, isn't it nice to know that the orchestras of Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles did all this vintage work?"
5,Cross Stitch Teddies over 40 wonderful Designs to Cherish,Great book I ordered this one for a friend as we couldn't buy it in Australia
5,A Must Read for Every Parent,"This book is quick and easy to read due to its methodical layout. The first three parts of the book set the stage for helping parents understand the teenage mind and the general concepts of setting boundaries. Part four lists specific issues most parents of teens will deal with. In each specific issue, the author defines the problem and then describes how to handle the problem. I recommend parents read the book from beginning to end to get the entire picture and benefit of the author's advice. What's nice about the fourth part of the book is that parents can time and time again flip to the specific behavior they are dealing with and review the advice. So far, Dr. Townsend's advice is working wonderfully in our household. I wish this book had been around years ago when my oldest became a teenager! I plan to buy copies of the book for my friends with teenagers."
1,Think again,This book confuses God and psychology but explains little about either one. The author bolsters a weak theory by qouting the Bible.Pass this one up.
5,Great Book,I have order this book for myself and several friends. It is a great book and if followed will help you navigate through the teenage years with your child.
3,Book Ok,"It was ok, learned a few good ideas, but most were about authors own children. I did come away with some ""give this thought"" and learn from it."
4,Could live without the Biblical references....,"This is a very good and useful tool in parenting teens although I'm not sure how parenting in the year 2008 compares to Biblical times, therefore, I could have lived with fewer (if any) Biblical references and references to how God will help me raise my teen. I didn't find any of that useful."
5,"simple, basic - perfect for the beginner.","I don't think the author would make any claim about this book being suitable for all golfers. Those who have been playing for years probably wouldn't get much out of it. But for people who are relatively new to the game I reckon it is perfect. I expected golf instruction books to be far too complicated for me but this makes the game sound relatively straightforward. And since buying this book not only has my enjoyment level risen, I have also broken 90 for the first time. If it's science you're after, don't get it. If it's simple, basic tips that avoid 'paralysis by analysis', which so many of my golfing friends suffer from, then this book will prove very helpful."
5,"Great sound, Great variety","AK Press rocks, and so does this album. It covers every thing from anti-folk to hardcore punk to dance beats. All the songs are easy to listen to, but if you think about the lyrics you can get an even better message. The only flaw I can think of is that there is almost too much variety, but the transitions are well done. If you don't buy this album to help out the AK Press, buy it for the great sound."
2,not worth your time,"I had a lot of hope for this book, and with the second story, ""Eating Out at Cafe Z"", I thought the book was living up to my expectations. However, it's all downhill from there, and there's about 25 stories in all. Talk about disappointing. The fourth story, ""Merry Christmas, Katherine"" was also quite good. Unfortunately, with fetish stories like ""Picking up Daddy"" and pretentious drudgery like ""Le Main"", the book is not even worth a second glance. Pass on by."
3,angela the angel,"Great music by Anja Garbarek, except I was really hoping to hear the song from the nightclub - its isn't on this soundtrack. 'Can I keep Him' is a beautiful song, here it is a little different from the video clip on the DVD, but still has romantic charm. A good one to own."
3,not as good as the first one...but worth reading,"I have to agree with one of the other reviews. This was a good book, but not as interesting as the first and certainly not of the caliber you'd expect if you're a CQY fan."
2,You can do better...,"As a physical therapist I was looking for a quality ice pack for my clinic and/or to recommend to patients with any number of should conditions. This is not as smooth as in the picture. Since there are ice packs in the wrap, they don't conform to your shoulder girdle as well. Usually patients don't have symptoms below or at the elbow thus this wrap isn't beneficial. It is difficult to ice common sore areas such as, the posterior and lateral aspect of the shoulder. The only plus is that the patient would be able to put this on themselves with their other arm. This is the shoulder wrap that I would recommend.Elasto Gel Shoulder Sleeve Ice & Hot Wrap (LARGE/X-LARGE. It isn't perfect but I would give it 4 stars. Check the product page for my review."
4,Baseball Pitcher Shoulder Ice Wrap,"This is a good, quick and convenient alternative in place of ice bags for getting a cold wrap on a player's shoulder and elbow."
4,Great help for young pitchers,"I bought this shoulder ice wrap for my son he is 14 years old and it does its job is easy to use ,but do not expect to recieved the ice wrap matching the color it has in the picture, the one that was sent to me is dark blue and it looks cheapy than the one in the picture also does not have logo of any company, I think its pricey for the quality."
5,Great Product,"Selected this shoulder/elbow wrap for my son who is a high school pitcher to use after pitching as suggested by coaches. Works very well and stay on even while my son moves around. The strap, however does not have any wording on it as pictured. It's all black."
5,"Easy to read, comprehensive look at Long Term Care","I wish I had this book when I had to weigh my options for putting a family member in a nursing home! Cirillo covered most of the relevant issues, and also provided some nice life-lessons for us all.Cirillo writes is a very casual style. You almost feel like you are sitting down with a story teller, who happens to be a trusted friend. His allusions to his ""old neighborhood"" of South Philadelphia provide a nice slice of life. You can tell that Cirillo speaks from experience and with a passion for his commitment to long term care. This is not the cold synthesis of a researcher; rather stories with a purpose from a warm-hearted, well-organized educator, entertainer, and long term care professional.This book is something that every potential client for long term care should read."
2,Kindle edition not in color,"I downloaded the sample through kindle hoping to enjoy it in color on my iPad, but it was not put in e-format in color. Some books lose nothing for lack of color, but this one does, in my opinion. I wish the rating system had a separate section for format; this is probably an excellent book, but not in kindle format."
5,Texhnolyze Review,"I only watched the first few episodes and already I fell in love with it. I can't explain how much this story rocks. I mean the characters are terrific and the story is so deep, I will even go as far as to say it's better than Fullmetal Alchemist and Serial Experiment Lain, which I love darely. The main character has a strong will to live and has been through much pain and sorrow. Indeed a great anime, I believe an anime fan of any type will enjoy this. Especially fans of sci-fi, action, and drama type anime."
5,Super watch,"This watch is the most comfortable that I have ever worn. Extremely light weight with an infinitely adjustable band. This is my second Skagen. Wore the first one every day for 5 years, untill the band started to come apart."
5,Great watch!,"I ordered this watch as a replacement watch for my husband, who had previously worn the same Skaagen watch for 10 years. It comes beautifully packaged (my hubby likens it to an Apple product). Amazon has the best price!"
5,Skagen Men's 355LGSC Two-Tone Mesh Band Watch,very good looking watch. fits well and can wear with lots of differant clothes and outfits.very pleased with the purchase
2,Glass broke and band broke on first watch,"This is a very nice-looking watch and was a replacement for the first watch I purchased from another company about two years ago. On that first purchase of the identical watch, the glass cracked and the band broke after having for only a year and a half. The calendar date is too small to read but the appearance of the watch makes up for this. The price is very good but just be careful wearing every day."
3,Disappointment with Skagen Watch,"I have bought Skagen Men's 355LGSC watches for a long time and have had a wonderful, long-life experience with them and have rated them a 5. EXCEPT for the one I purchased on 10 Jun 2011. It quit working on 30 Apr 2012. Now that isn't even one year's worth for a $47.06 watch! I am disappointed, but have ordered another one (exact make and model), as the past has proven to be a good relationship. Let's hope it works longer than 10 1/2 months this time."
3,"Good looking watch, but I got a surprise later.","I received the watch on time and eveything as expected, like most review says about the date being too small, but I was happy.A couple of weeks later on an occasion the watch ran late for more then an hour without stoppage, so I monitor it closelyuntil a week later it happened again, this time was 59 minutes, in between time it ran just perfect, no stoppage again.So I returned it to the seller and now I am awaiting for it's replacement. (yes I like it that much)"
5,Great watch.,"A great watch. Only issue which isn't a big deal given the value of the watch, is the miniscule date window."
1,Beautiful watch very expensive look,"This watch really deserves 5 stars, but for what it is supposed to do it doesnt, that is keep time, i have bought for myself and my family in total five skagen watches, mainly for the looks, but is dissapointed at the functionality, i wanted a beautiful everyday watch, plus, dont bother about the date function, you may be able to see the date in the picture, but really its close to impossible to read in real life. too small.my watch kept stopping, thought it was the batterey, changed it but still no change, i will be sending it back, will let you know what service i get, if negative or possitive will let you know, as for the rest of my skagen watches, i have not really tested them as this one as i wear them for a day or so and put it away.but i still say if you are looking for a really gentlemanly classy quality look watch that will not break the bank this is it. any skagen watch.i live in the Uk, and bought mine from the states."
1,nice watch but awful quality,I bought this watch thinking it would be great quality because it's a skagen. Wrong!! Within months the hour markers started falling off and getting in the way of the time mechanism. That took care of the watch. It stopped working and when I contacted Skagen they said that if it ever fell the warranty would be voided. Even the cheapest Walmart watches don't have things falling off from falling. Very disappointed! I wasted my money. I replaced it with the medana watch for about $13 and so far so good. NO PROBLEMS with that one!!
1,boyfriend didn't like it,my boyfriend didn't like the appearance of the watch. he prefers a different style watch. he will choose his own watch
4,the most thought provoking probability book ever written,"This is the book we called Feller Volume II in graduate school. We used it to sharpen our intuition about probability. Feller was a master at explaining difficult things in simple ways. This includes the waiting time paradox and Benford's laws. For structure and rigor we looked elsewhere, Chung and/or Neveu. But Feller's books brought a joy and love for the subject. No statistician or probabilist should be without a copy on his shelf!In spite of the fact that Feller produced one of the most general versions of the central limit theorem, there are no asymptotic theorems or proofs in this book."
2,"Far fetched solution, indeed.","Publisher's Weekly indicates that readers may be disappointed by the far-fetched solution, and that's a kind way to put the ending -- tying the Savoy Hotel desk clerk who only happened to witness the first death, back into the heart of the whole murderous mechanism -- that yanks the long arm of coincidence right out of its socket. In a mystery, I like at least a sporting chance to spot the murderer and the mechanism; here, no such luck. What happened to the fabled British sense of fair play?"
3,Not as good as the first two in the series.,"I absolutely loved the first two books of this series. The writing was such that I'd read passages aloud to others. This didn't have that same cache'. There didn't seem to be as much interaction between the two protagonists until well into the book. Fowler loves introducing twists to the plot which is fun, but the solution to the mystery really strains credibility. There is a secondary protagonist in Sam Gates, a receptionist at the Savoy, but the outcome of her fear of the dark really bothered me. I enjoyed the story, but didn't feel it was nearly as good as the first two books."
4,77 Clocks,Classic Christopher Fowler...always a great read - the bumbling Arthur with his sophisticated sidekick John are always entertaining. Fowler has a way of writing that allows you to picture his main characters and their situations vividly. The 'supporting cast' also come to life and add a welcome dimension to the tale. There is always a twist and you won't be disappointed with 77 Clocks. Do yourself a favour and check out some of his earlier novels - Disturbia and Spanky are two of his best - totally different to this series but you won't want to put them down!
2,Disapointing though Entertaining,"This was an enjoyable read, well written - but really lacking substance. If I wanted a good read I'd pickup some fiction or a memoir, I bought this book looking for solid advice on how to gain an internship and sadlly found the book lacking in this department.About a quater of the book is dedicated to getting an internship, arguarblly the most vital part and the advice given is to me seemed very ho-hum, like it just came out of my teachers mouth.Where the book is at its best is preparing nervous interns, common sense answers mixed in with some entertaining disaster stories of what not to do.Overal it was high on style, low on substance. The book cites the dummies guide as a refernce, I cant help but feel it would be more informative."
3,I guess I missed something.,"Interesting? Yes? Way Over The Top? Yes and yes again. And the ending when the bad guys are identified, cliche does not even come close. A Windy murder? That was clever. Quick read, wait for the paperback."
2,An entertaining bit of education for laypeople,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did--anyone who casts a thinly-disguised Bill Gates as he is in Format C: can't be all bad. If there had been computer-related thrillers and product placement in the era of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith, this book would fit right in.It is nonetheless entertaining, and I think it may serve best as a diverting introduction for the general public, who is unaware of the tactics of FUD, intentional incompatibility, and the like that are described herein so that the average person can understand them. I hope that people who read this book will understand more of what Microsoft has done because of it."
5,Every bit as good as Dan Brown's work,"I bought ""Format C:"" at about the same time I purchased a hardback first edition of ""Digital Fortress,"" Dan Brown's first novel. I have to say, as a Y2K computer thriller, this book blew away Dan Brown. It wasn't until I read Brown's ""Angels & Demons"" that I began to appreciate his work. Yes, as one reviewer states, this work is a bit over top. But so is ""Angels & Demons."" This is a heck of a ride and a terrific book."
4,A thought-provoking shift for the humanist sci-fi genre,"Having just submitted a full review of this for the Providence Journal, I will point out only that Black follows the tradition of Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984. He provides a new form of Big Brother for us to speculate about and gives a few intriguing insights into Jerusalem and Judaic tradition that are worth exploring.I object to the stereotypes and the blockbuster quality of the final chapters, and when the red Del Sol was smashed I nearly walked out. (I began to wonder about halfway through if Black began this manuscript as a film script.) But Black has potential, and I anticipate a good read when his next production appears."
