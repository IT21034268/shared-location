4,Benecol Smart Chews,"There is a good supply of the chews in the box. The taste is good but, of course, not as good as real candy. I eat them with almonds to get better flavor. As for lowering cholesterol, only time will tell."
4,BENECOL SMART CHEWS,"My cholesterol readings have improved with the help of the chews, I believe. However, I may like the chews better if they were less sweet."
5,Reviewing Benecol chews,"Great product - IF it does the job for me (reducing cholesterol). Quick and easy service from you all, also. I think I will like the automatic re-order system, also."
3,Benecol,The product was delivered promptly. I have been taking it as directed. I will be able to give you a better review the next time that I go see my doctor and have my BP taken and cholesterol checked. We will revisit this by the spring. Thanks.
5,"Benecol Chews,","I have been taking two chews a day as recommended for about two months and when I had my cholesterol checked, found that my LDL had dropped a great deal. I recommend this as an easy way to deal with your cholesterol. While I have used the Benecol spread, this is a more certain way of getting the amount you need without all the fat and calories."
2,"Nice, convenient candy","Although not sweet, Psyllium would be more effective then this candy like product. It would probably be cheaper too.Or, you can try the Metamucil."
1,Did not work for me,"I have been on 10 mgs of Lipitor for about seven years. I thought I might be able to get my cholesterol down even further by taking the chews. I don't eat meat, eat sensibly, count calories (I'm not obsessed), exercise at least three days a week, no alcohol. I've been taking the chews since February. My cholesterol is approx what it was last year (prior to the chews), 184, but my triglycerides are now in the borderline high zone. Not sure what happened but I'm off to the doctor's to see what I can do about it. I'm glad it works for some and wish it worked for me. :("
3,ADDITIVES,"AFTER READING ONLINE THE AFFECTS OF YELLOW DYE 6, I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THIS PRODUCT. I NOTICED THAT I WAS FEELING ANXIOUS AFTER EATING THESE CARAMELS SO AFTER DOING RESEARCH ABOUT THE DYE THAT IS USED, I DECIDED THAT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THE COMPANY CANT REMOVE THIS FROM THEM. I DID EMAIL THEM TO ASK THAT QUESTION. THEY JUST EMAILED BACK AND THANKED ME FOR MY INTEREST."
5,Great tasting!,"I am seeing one of the 84 board certified lipidologists in the U.S. and he strongly recommends Benecol margarine, so when I saw these chews I knew I had to try them. I was having trouble eating 2 tbsp of the Benecol margarine a day, but it is easy to get the recommended amount with these chews. I will have my cholesterol checked again in a couple of weeks, so hopefully it helps along with medication. They really do taste like a caramel candy. I would recommend them highly!"
5,a winner,"I have seen a drop in my total cholesterol and LDL-not dramatic, but enough that I don't need to go on cholesterol-lowering medication ."
3,benecol chews,this product is pretty good just little expensive it fulfilled the need and had a great taste to itwith no after breath.
3,side effects,"There seems to be some side effect to the Benecol chews. Eveytime I try one, I get a GI upset and gassiness with nausea."
5,Benecol Benefit,"My experiment was a success!I ate like a pig and took two Benecol chews a day and ate oatmeal intermittently. Unlike my experiment with Colest Off I made no attempt to be a vegetarian. The results were still promising and show that the Benecol Chews are a potent force in lowering Total Cholesterol.My Total Cholesterol with no supplements and no diet change is a scary 287, with Colest Off and a partial vegetarian diet my total cholesterol is about 197 with a good ratio of HDL to LDL. The Benecol Chews reduced my total to an unimpressive 237, but considering that I ate high cholesterol foods this shows the potency of plant STANOLs.CholestOff 240 cplts"
5,It works.,Why someone hasn't advertised the heck out of this is beyond me. It is an over the counter product and it works. My cholesterol numbers improved significantly.
3,The Product Changed,"When I first started using this product, recommended by my doctor about a year ago, the consistency was very creamy. Once the packaging was changed--each caramel had been a cube, then it changed to a rectangle--the consistency did also. It is now grainy. So far, I'm continuing to use the product, but I much preferred the earlier version. What happened to their quality control?"
4,it really works!!,"I'd been using the Benecol chews for several months, planning on getting a cholesterol test, to see if they helped. Then they went out of stock for several months & I tried another product that I didn't like as well. I was so happy when these came back, since they tasted much better. They really taste like caramel chews. HOWEVER, they do leave a little film on the inside of your mouth afterwards. The film is not too bad; I think of them as little desserts. I just got back my cholesterol test results and my LDL (bad cholesterol) went down 27 points (from 164 to 137)! I'm really pleased."
1,Benecol and Side Affects,"Unfortunately I was unable to tolerate this product. My stomach hurt daily and with each day it got worse. Stopped taking the Benicol and the stomach pains went away. I gave this product a try for 2 weeks, by the end of that period I was in a lot of pain that radiated to my back. I wished I could have tolerated this product."
5,Real Tasty,"These were real tasty and good and I finished the first batch ahead of time so had to order more. No problems with the order. They make for a great snack but I have not yet checked my cholesterol so unsure if really beneficial. Will be going for my annual checkup in Jan, so will find out if it really works."
2,Taste Like Caramel,"20 Calories, 4 grams sugar, 15 grams sodium, 0.7 grams plant sterols, 40 mg calcium. 1st ingrediet- Sugar, 2nd corn syrup. etc. Looks like we will enjoy the sweetness as we lower the LDL's. Bring it on !Follow-up: Well I have went through 3 boxes & had several routine bloodworks & I really can't see where they help. Sorry"
2,Benecol Chews,"5 Benecol chews are required to lower cholesterol. I thought that at one time before the chews were discontinued, only 2 were required. 5 chews have too much sugar, but I suppose that I will continue to use them for awhile. I am trying to combine the chews with Benecol margarine so that I can take both fewer chews and less margarine."
2,New Formulation - Some important changes,"Some others have pointed out that the new formulation changed the shape, size taste and consistency of the chews. But there are some more important changes you need to know about.First of all, each piece contains less plant sterol esters (0.70 down from 0.85), but more sugars (4g up from 3g). They have also added 50mg of calcium.One study has shown that calcium in conjunction with plant sterols has beneficial effects on HDL and LDL. (Effects of calcium and plant sterols on serum lipids in obese Zucker rats on a low-fat diet - Timo Vaskonena, Eero Mervaalaa, Ville Sumuvuoria, Tuulikki Sepp√§nen-Laaksoa and Heikki Karppanena - British Journal of Nutrition 2002)However, other studies indicate that calcium might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, possibly due to supressing Vitamin D levels. All of this is still somewhat controversial, so I suggest you do your research before using this product."
1,This product contains partially hydrogenated vegetable oil!,"Yes plant sterols help lower your cholesterol, but why pay top dollar for a product that contains partially hydrogenated vegetable oil?! Get your plant sterols elsewhere."
4,"Good product, bad wrapper...","I ordered these for my husband to help bring his cholesterol down. He said he likes them, they're soft enough. But the wrapper is a pain to open. He's only 37. I read on someone's review that they changed the wrapper. The wrapper is a paper, not a foil wrapper. I remember when the calcium chews had that foil wrapper. It was a pain to open. So these are somewhat easier but maybe they should just stop wrapping them or change the shape and make a twist wrapper instead...I could see how these would be difficult to open for the elderly or someone with arthritis."
4,Difficult to remove wrapping,"It is very hard to remove the wrapping on most of the caramels.Aside from that, the taste is OK.However, the real test will be when I have my next cholesterol test to see if indeed it helped to lower it."
3,Hard to Unwrap,I'm still in the trial stage with this product. Will say now that the chews are pleasant tasting and have a palatable consistency. But they are difficult to unwrap. It's hard to find a corner or edge to grab and the foil sometimes sticks to the chews. This is at room temp. I imagine it would be a mess in heat. There's no unwrapping a chew discreetly if you are out to dinner or on the run at work. And it would be a challenge with arthritic or large fingers. Based on this I give it a 3. Will re-rate when I get actual results in 2 more months.
5,Benecol Review,"These really do work! I didn't want to keep buying them until we did a blood test after 1/2 of the product was used, 2 chews a day. No change in activity level or diet and currently on perscription medication for cholesterol. Cholesterol was within normal levels after the benecol chews and it didn't change much or quickly with medication. We will keep buying these for sure!"
2,benacol,Never helped at all after 3 months use!I don't think I would recommend to anyone. I was really hoping it would be a help to me since I can't take statin drugs.
5,works amazing,This product works very well and lowers cholestrial over 50 points alone. Stay away from stations and do it the natural way
4,PRETTY GOOD,"We have used benechol offor a long time. It uBenecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chewssed to be a little bigger portion and easier to open. Now is OK but gripes a little thats its smaller insize I think they had to do it for economical reasons."
4,benecol chews,got my two month blood work back and dropped 60 points no need to go on statins now very happy
5,These Really Work !!,"I had my cholesterol tested after using these for 4 months and it dropped 40 points, I'm a true believer in these now!! I like the taste of these also, I know some don't but they are just fine with me and like a nice little treat after I eat. My next batch I received they seemed to have changed the wrapper a little and now they are much easier to open also. I will continue using these as long as I contiunue getting good results in my cholesterol score."
3,Tasty but could be easier to open,"I presume the Benecol is doing its anti-colestoral job, but I also take Lipitor. The Benecols are tasty but seem difficult to open since they are wrapped in foil tightly. A ""draw string"" would be helpful if it does not add to expense."
4,New taste,"I have been using Benecol smart chews for the last 2 years and they have been great for lowering my cholesterol. A great alternative to statin drugs. I was completely dismayed when they were taken off the market a few months ago. I just received my first shipment of the ""new"" Benecol chews. The taste is dreadful! I will take them but I am very disappointed in the new taste. I guess they reformulated this product. Also, they are not available any more by the automatic system at Amazon-also a disappointment."
3,What did they do to the taste of these Benecol Chews?,"I have been using these Benecol Chews for some time now and always loved the taste. They really were like having a small, satisfying snack. While I am still going to purchase them because I'm running out and they really did help lower my cholesterol, they really do taste awful. They are gritty and I don't look forward to having my ""small snack"" any longer. Please change them back to the delicious caramel taste they had!"
2,What's Not To Like? A Lot!,"This reviewer was ""pushed"" to try these chews by his dietician in response to high cholesterol. Carmel flavored, they are taken twice a day at mealtime-and they work. The chews are not available at retail, so outlets like amazon are the sole choices. If there is a downside to Benocal, this reviewer/consumer has yet to discover it.HOWEVER! Since writing the original message (above), this reviewer experienced major availability problems with this product. As it is unavaiable at retail, there was no no alternative but to go on a prescription drug. This situation can always recur. For safety sake, Benecol isn't worth it, no matter how well it works.At least Crestor, Lipitor and similar formulations are always there at your corner drug store-side effects notwithstanding."
2,Benecol chews,The chews do not taste bad - but the buttery spread is better. I probably will not buy them again.
3,Bound Up,Love the caramel flavor and texture. Had high hopes for this product as my cholesterol is extremely high and I cannot tolerate the statins in normal medications. Used the butter for about three weeks before the chews. Extremely expensive but does it work? After about a week on the chews I noticed that my stomach was not feeling normal. A couple more days and constipation set in. I stopped taking the benecol and started stool softeners and laxatives. After about two weeks my system somewhat returned to normal. Side effects include but are not limited to constipation.
2,Overall Healthy?,"If I would have looked at the ingredients before purchasing, I would not have purchased this product. The first two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. There is also soy lecithin, which I try to avoid, if possible. Just be aware that the use of the words smart chews may be misleading, if you try to avoid certain ingredients in ""healthy"" products."
3,Melted?,"The chews have helped me change my cholesterol and fat numbers for the better. I've ordered 3 containers from Amazon. The first two were great. When I opened the third batch, the wrappers on the chews were slightly sticky. The chews themselves were different from my first two experiences in that they were waxy and opaque on the surface. The waxy/stickiness made them difficult to unwrap and I tend to just have to squeeze them out of the wrapper. I'm guessing they were stored/transported at too high a temperature and melted at some point but really have no idea. I'm hoping that my next order is not like this one. We'll see."
3,Benecol Smart Chews,I won't know how effective this product is for lowering cholesterol until my husband has his next blood test.The vendor was shipping automatically each month. A month was missed and I received twice the amount a month later. I will cancel this auto order if that happens again.
1,rip off,This was a super saver shipping item that charged me shipping when I entered the benicol discount code. I am through ordering from you.
2,Not really impressed,"This product is definitely not for diabetics, or anyone watching their weight (which most cardiac patients are supposed to do). It is very high in calories (20 per chew, and they recommend two chews at a time), and it is also high in salt (Sodium 15 mg per chew, 30 per recommended serving). Salt is somthing cardiac patients are supposed to restrict, or at the least, limit.I also noted an undesirable thick waxy coating left on the roof of my mouth. The coating is tasteless (not the candy itself). One other side-effect I noticed is constipation."
4,Great idea,"We use this item for my teenage daughter who already has high cholesterol due to a strong family history of same. It's much easier and more convenient than taking the pills, and less expensive. She thinks the taste is good as well. I can't say for sure whether they are effective in bringing down cholesterol or not. However, my daughter's recent bloodwork shows significantly decreased cholesterol levels, so it's definitely worth a try."
5,Benecol,Just got my blood work back and lowered it by 20 pts. This is the only thing I have added to helping lower my cholesterol.
4,reducing cholesterol,"The best I can say about this product is that by eating 2 of these special caramels, which taste very good, and greatly reducing eggs in my diet, my cholesterol dropped 29 points in 5 months. I'm sure the eggs are big factor, but reducing eggs alone didn't give meas dramatic a result as eating caramels as well."
4,My cholesterol is down.,"I have been eating 2 benecol chews daily for about 8 months. My cholesterol has dropped to 180. I must say that I am also on a cholesterol lowering medication, but I think the chews helped a bit. Also, I like the taste. They can be a little waxy , but I don't get to eat much candy these days."
5,Mayo clinic was right......,Benecol chew brought my cholesterol level down to a normal range after 3 months of use. No problems with liver function as with the statins and cheaper than red yeast rice. I recommend it and have recommended it to friends.
3,Ms. April,"Not sure how well they work yet because i haven't been on them that long, but the taste is great."
2,Didn't work for me.,"Unfortunately this product did not reduce my cholesterol. Effects vary from person to person. Worth a try though. Meds are the only thing that help (I've tried red wine, I'm vegetarian, low fat, exercise and the list goes on)."
5,Cute Little Puppet,"Bought it for our daughter, she loves it. The hand hole is a little small for adult hands but other than that, it's super cute, even as just a stuffed toy."
2,I love the Bobbsey Twins. But skip this one.,"I have been a fan of the Bobbsey Twin series since I was a little girl. This Kindle version is the original, non-updated version. While most of the original books contain racial stereotypes (mostly around Sam and Dinah, the African American servants who seem to do just about everything for the Bobbseys), this book also contains lots of offensive content about the Romani (gypsies). Some Romani come to town, a bunch of stuff gets stolen, everybody assumes they're to blame . . . and lets just say that this isn't one of those books with the moral that stereotypes lead us to making mistaken assumptions. Honestly, I wouldn't expose children to any of this.And it's no loss, as the plot is incredibly weak."
1,Bobbsey Twins Blueberry Island,I was extremely disappointed with the biases that were presented regarding a different people group. The adjective that was used to describe the younger twins was extremely degrading.
1,NOT AS GOOD AS VARIETEASE OR TEASERAMA,"Video in poor condition due to deterioration of master film, I suppose. Some skits downright boring. Not enough Lili St. Cyr or Bettie Page. ... I rate this film a loser. Do not purchase!"
4,"where did ""Starring"" Lovely Lili St. Cyr go ?",My main reason for buying this vidio was Lili St. Cyr in her CINDERELLA'S LOVE LESSON ! There is only a very short bathtub scene that ends at the beginning. Certainly not the one she was famous for. On the back of the vidiobox is a picture of her in a blue negligee putting on stockings. This is nowhere on the tape.
5,chii chi,This is a fun book which will get you to practice golf skills painlessly. It is definitely reminiscent of ChiChi who made golf look like so much fun.I'd recommend it for almost any level of golfer
4,Another Geneen Roth Classic,"A good read, as expected from Geneen Roth. Very similar ideas to her other books, but if you aren't familiar with her stuff or want more, this is a great one to pick up."
5,very good self help tool for weight related issues,"Geneen is an expert in understanding the issues around weight, body image, etc. This is a great tool in helping you get in touch with your ideas, feelings, baggage associated with weight issues-"
5,why weight?,"i had a problem with this purchase. i contacted the seller, who immediately rectified the problem in a timely and professional fashion. this company has good business acumen. i will certainly do business with them again."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"This book is not what I expected. It's more of a ""workbook"" instead of a book to read. I was thoroughly disappointed."
2,The Usual Self Help Book,"I did not find this book to have any ""solutions."" It was simply the usual self-help book which never goes to the root of any problem."
3,"Had some good parts, but more of a workbook than anything.","I found that some of the stuff in this book was helpful to a certain extent. I could relate to the things the author was trying to convey, and she make some good points. However, I found that the further you get into the book, the more workbook exercises there are, and it gets tedious after a while. I was looking for more insight and less of me trying to scour my mind for answers to situations I have never been through.It might work for some and not for others, but it's not without good insight,"
2,Sd583,Will not order from this company again. This company was the Perfume Company. I paid next day and it was charged to my acct but was sent ground and took over a week to receive it. I would not recommend this company.
3,Difficult to Say,"The problem with rating supplements is that sometimes you just can't see a marked improvement. I take PAPA because I know I should at my age. One upside, the positive thing I can say for Source Naturals, they sell a quality product at a reasonable price."
2,Never recieved order,"I was so much looking forward to getting this order because I had watched this series when they used to have it on but for some reason this order was supposed to come by postal service and I never got this order. My order had gotten lost through the mail and that just goes to show you how careless the postal service is. It wasn't the seller's fault because they offered to refund or replace my order, so I ended up requesting a refund and ordering this from a different place."
1,"Buy them separate, you will pay less",I cannot understand why they are charging so much for all 6 seasons together when if you buy them separately they come out to $85.97 which is a savings of $58.02. I guess they figure most people won't do the math and just order all the seasons together out of convenience.
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The book does explain the basics of Ajax, but there is so much verbal filler, I eventually was flipping pages looking for the substance. I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Ajax and Design Patterns,"Making the change from traditional web programming to Ajax, requires a total mind-shift. Ajax in Action can help you do this with very few headaches.I found that you do need quite a bit of previous knowledge of technologies like JavaScript, knowledge of OOP, CSS, XHTML standards and DOM programming. You need to know some server-side programming in a language such as Php.The point is, the book is not exactly for beginners in the web-programming environment, but rather for programmers wanting to learn, understand and successfully implement the use of Ajax.The chapters on Design Patterns were of much use to me too.I highly recommend this book to any programmer wanting to master the concept of Ajax."
1,Lacks focus,"If you are an experienced programmer and already familiar with design patterns, refactoring, and application architecture, then you will probably find this book to be very frustrating.The author seems to be on a crusade to rid the world of bad coding practices, and though I fully salute his efforts, I think this book is horribly mis-titled. A more appropriate title would have been ""Principles of Web architecture and design... and a few words about Ajax"".All I wanted was to learn the mechanics of ajax, and after reading the first 100 pages and getting nothing (new) out of it, I felt like my time had been robbed."
2,don't ..,"First couple of chapters are ok.Thereafter, the book has a nice discussion on oo patterns for javascript. Along the way, the book tries to give many ideas on how to design application framework. Yet I would expect to have learned all of this somewhere else! IMHO, a good book on AJAX would introduce the subject and show how AJAX changes the old ways of app design. Who needs the explanation of old concepts again.I found this book annoying to read. It is not going straight to the point."
2,"Useful to somebody, but not me.","The first chapter was a good introduction to the need for AJAX. After that, I never could figure out where the discussion of the basics of AJAX was. A paltry 1/2 page discussion (out of the book's 600+ pages) of the XMLHttpRequest object (the very heart of AJAX) exists, and that's about it.To be sure, the authors certainly know their stuff. This book contains useful chapters on topics like refactoring, RSS feeds and security issues. But if you are looking for a basic tutorial that will get you up to speed quickly I would suggest the ""AJAX For Dummies"" book. At about half the cost and size, it's a much better read. Put this together with Larry Ullman's ""Building a Web Site with AJAX"" and you will have a solid foundation to build on. After that you might want to come back to this book and dive into the advanced topics."
4,Detailed but not good for beginners,"If you are arriving at AJAX with a basic web development foundation, you will find ""Ajax in Action"" to be challenging to digest. From the introduction, the overall level of the book jumps right into code samples and skips most of the basics, making it an intermediate book at best.I found the chapter on Ajax portal architecture using Java to be particularly useful, along with the Live Search chapter. But besides that, I didn't find as accessible as another book titled ""Foundations of Ajax"". I would recommend ""Ajax in Action"" only to developers who have at least a couple of years of web dev under their belt."
3,javascript is very sad oo and event handling script language,"the impression i have is ajax is just CSS, Javascript, DOM, XMLHttpRequest, and some pattern (4 pillars + patterns). the author doesnt really talk much about Ajax other than 4 pillars + patterns + projects. his explanation on Javascript is inadequate, make sure you read Javascript before you start this book. also Javascript with inadequate support for oo and syntactical hack is a very painful and sad script language to do client-side oo developement."
2,Not all top-knotch coders can write,"The authors seems to know what they're talking about.But they didn't, in my view, design and organizea good book about the subject. How-to-do-it programmingbooks should start with Hello World examples and build upwardsfrom there (see Rasmus Lerdorf's recent usenet post about AJAX).This book seems to wend its way aimlessly from subject to subjectwithout making any coherent connections."
2,An introduction and a tour but not the nuts and bolts,"As an experienced developer already using ajax and looking for some best practices, I was dissapointed. Perhaps the topic is too broad for a single book to give a working developer the desired depth.I'm hoping the next book on Prototype will be more of what I need."
5,Excellent Seller,"Excellent seller, book arrived in a timely fashion and was new as advertised. will buy from seller again"
4,"Wordy, but still one of the best there is","This is the most systematic book on Ajax usage and patterns I've seen so far, giving you way more than just the technology overview and recipes. I also liked the very clean and thorough approach to JavaScript coding emphasized in an Appendix (which is, BTW, also one of the best JavaScript texts I've encountered).Unfortunately, this book is also one of the wordiest I've read recently, occasionally giving you the feeling the authors just had to reach a certain page count, so they go into minor details and explain them in great length, while in other cases they just skip important topics they don't like (for example, using IFRAME POST instead of XmlHttpRequest)."
2,Incorrectly named and promoted.,"I agree with one of the reviewers (D. Klebanov) who suggested to re-name this book to ""Principles of Web architecture and design... and a few words about Ajax""I wanted a book that focuses strictly on Ajax functionality. This book is often vague and verbose and lacks unity.It feels like the Authors took the Ajax concept and stretched it onto the set of many different topics. Some topics are pertinent to Ajax others are just subtly related.I did find a lot of useful information in this book, but for the most part those things had nothing to do with Ajax. Just general strategies of web development. So I give it 2 stars because it is well written, although rather verbose. But really this is like ordering an apple and getting an orange and then trying to write a review on how oranges are also good."
3,Good At What it Does--But Not About AJAX,"Finally, I am so happy to see what some other reviewers say. This book is not really that much about AJAX. I feel that I have wasted my AJAX budget. Sure, there is lots of valuable stuff here but the percentage of this book that is about AJAX proper.I would say that 5 of the 13 chapters are about AJAX but that of course means that 8 are not at all about AJAX. At the same time, I got ""Pragmatic AJAX"" by the always funny Ben Galbraith. If you need to focus on AJAX--read Pragmatic AJAX."
4,If only more people knew how to use this technology,"This book does a good job of introducing AJAX. Unfortunately, AJAX has not gone mainstream at this point and is difficult to fit into an existing architecture that was not originally based on AJAX."
1,"Verbos : Thick book, thin in useful information","I tried reading the book (up to chapter 8) still could not find a piece of useful information written properly or completely. Vague writing. I don't think the author has actual experience Ajax or design patterns ,he talks about.The chapters and sample codes looks more like written by a beginner . Too much plumbing and bad coding practice.And did I said verbose ?"
4,Fascinating,"I found this to be a fascinating insight into the lives and leisures of the Benedictine Order of Monks. True, to contemporary ears the complete obediance and devotion demanded seem harsh but it is an amazing look into the expectations of early church founders. For a religious book, it is an incredible page turner. I finished it in approximately 2.5 hours. If you have an interest in Medieval Religious Life, this is one to have."
5,Great!,I love this book. It is easy to read. St. Benedict offers wonderfu and practical guidelines for life. A must read.
4,Interesting though a bit disappointed,"The use of the word 'interesting' seems to be inappropriate for this book. For me as a Catholic the life of monasticism is still full of secret. Actually this book is a mere description of the rule of St Benedict as the title suggests and sometimes they are too strict and outdated. It requires a very high obedience standard from the monks and some of them are unreasonable for this era. Probably from historic viewpoint these rules make sense, but definitely not now. This book is still recommended, however, to those who are interested in sixth century's monasticism history and development."
2,Fine as a historical document but that's it,"The rule of St. Benedict is an important historical document as it guided Western monasticism for close to 1500 years. Anyone who attempts to follow it today to the letter needs to have their head (and heart) examined, though. He advocates physical beatings and other cruelties, even of the young. His advice that each monk be provided with no more than a pound of bread as their sole food daily provides no more than 1200 calories-an amount certain to lead to malnutrition in many people.Yes, I understand that Benedict was laying down rules for large communities in another age and era. Now, if only those who think that we should use this as a guide TODAY would only accept that this is not the middle ages and the context NOW makes many ancient texts irelevant. Read this for spiritual reading?! To what purpose? You can spend your time more profitably with another book that does not require another volume of commentary to expain, and apologize for it."
3,Very informative but very opinionated.,"This book has tons of useful information, but you will have to wade through the authors opinions to get it. I liked the book's layout and use it often, but the little ""snide"" comments made about Bush and others should have been left out."
3,Good Quick Guide,"This book gives a good quick overview of situations with welcome bouts of humor, but it is horribly outdated. The book was written before Saddam Hussein was ""found,"" so be mindful that politics and the landscape of the war have changed greatly since the book went to press."
3,Informative But Opinionated,"I must give credit where credit is due - the author has put a lot of hard work with the gathering of the facts, however, the book is quite opinionated at times."
1,What every American should know,I waited too long to order it. It was published almost 10 years ago so it wouldn't be topical. There
1,Uggh!,"Sit down, kick back, and get plastered while you read this book.Obviously the author did when she wrote it!So full of holes, contradictions, and glaring fairy tales that it makes ""Peter Pan"" look like a history channel documentary!"
3,Tea,"I had requested green tea and was sent Orange Pekoe Tea instead; an easy error, as the packaging are very similar. Unfortunately I did not notice this until I opened on of the containers. BUT, fortunaltely, I do like Orange Pekoe Tea. I will still have to order a box of green tea. In the future, I will bemore carel to check the label."
2,expensive lesson,"These stem caps are durable and add a great bit of flash to my Dodge Caliber. Problem is, they RUINED my valve stems! I thought my TPM (tire pressure monitor) system had gone haywire. Then I ended up with one flat tire which needed to be replaced, and all my valves had to be replaced! Do not buy these caps. A bit of flash is not worth your tires!"
4,Good Buy,"A nice little gadget, well worth the ~$25. Plenty sturdy enough for a Nikon d80 with 18-135 kit lens and anything lighter, which means I can use it with any of my cameras. Folds into a package the size and weight of a soda can, which makes it easy to take anywhere.Only minor drawback I can see is the mount, which can't be (at least easily) equipped with a quick-release - this means I have to take the shoe for my full-size tripod off before I use this one."
3,I'll stick to seven piece puzzles.,I can't remember how I ended up looking at this book but I did. I'll bet it's probably fun to be smart enough to understand stuff like this. I failed Algebra 1 though and probably just mispelled Alge[r]bra. And the word mispelled! Is it true that people that can understand this stuff have a hard time finding there way out of a phone booth?
3,"The start of western games on ps2, this game ain't worthy","Hey, if you're looking for a vintage western shooter, this game is it. It's like one of those John Wayne movies, bad guys, Saloons and same plots, plus an ugly damsel in distresss. I didn't much like it because it was too vintage, not modern, and the gameplay was so slow, it took a total of 5 seconds to shoot a bad guy... after i pulled the trigger. But if you're a western fan, this will do for now, in the mean time, another western based on the movie Open Range will be coming out by early 2005 in PS2, PSP, X-BOX and Gamecube, that or John Wayne's Rio Bravo which was announced early this year at the E3 Show to be coming out fall of 2004."
5,Great and unique Game,"What other game allows you to play a western movie?!?!This game is so addicting. I finished playing the game. And the best part is when you play the game again and start a new game, all the guns, items you bought through the first time are there for you to use!!! That's awesome. Some games don't let you carry items and weapons over to the next new game. Great job.Also, great job on the whole ambience of sound, music and the way the graphics look. Like a grainy western movie complete with lines through the film and dots appearing at random.I understand that some people don't like to play the game because it's linear. However, keep in mind that it's like a movie. A specific plot and path to complete. The plot is a bit simple, but that's what the old western movies were made from. Simple plot and a lot of cool shots!!So, I think this game is just fantastic. I disagree that it was boring and repetitive. It's fresh, fun and nostalgic.Have fun."
2,Great Action Game for the Western scene,"The game was a lot of fun to play, but can be beat in about 4 to 6 hours of play. This game is worth renting but not worth buying. Once the game is beat it is boring to play. The graphics are good, AI is good, but the story line is to short or to easy. If you think you want this game RENT it first, most likely after renting and beating it you won't want to buy it."
3,EH,"Nothing great, but still worth playing. Wish I hadn't bought it, cause I forget that I have it sometimes. Replay value is non-existent."
4,Guns of Fun!,"Bought the game on the first day it was released, and so far I've played it everyday. Graphics are good, controls are easy. Lots of targets to take aim and release vengance. The only drawback would be freedom to roam. As games and graphics get better, freedom to roam large cities, towns, or whatever, becomes increasingly more important. Sort of like GTA. But all in all this game is a buy."
5,ThIs GaMe RoCkS!,"Ok,i rented this game and i loved it i got it and the gameplay was awesome so my recomendation is,if you like action games with good storylines, GeT ThIs GaMe!!!!!"
2,Ehh...,"I got this game basically because of the company that made it: Rockstar Games. I loved the free form gameplay and non-linear storyline of the Grand Theft Auto series so I was hoping RDR would be similar. The graphics and visual style of the game are very cool, but I grew tired of the game at about Chapter 4 or 5. It just got repetitive and boring. So when I died I opted for the ""No"" when it asks if you want to continue and went to do something else. If you like walking around a set path and shooting stream after stream of bad guys, you will like this game. If you wanted a wild west GTA style game (like I did) look elsewhere."
3,Capcom,"The game was originally being done by Capcom which dropped the game altogether midway through programming, this probably explains some deficiencies in the game. Rockstar can always be counted on to give us great games so with that being ""said"" I will stay faithful to Rockstar and hope that the sequel to this game is better."
3,red dead revolver,"it starts out a great game, then it gets real tough to play, even easy it it is hard to play."
4,never been done this good ever!!!!,"this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2, the warriors, bully, and the world famous gta (grand theft auto) seriesgraphics 9/10sound 8/10gameplay 7.5/10overall 8.3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever!"
2,This is a peice of garbage,"I am in general very proud of what the boys at Rockstar have accomplished in there carear. The prestigious GTA and Max Payne series are no doubt the greatest in there genre. I have found that Red Dead Revolver falls far from the mark. This is just not an impressive game at all. The graphics are chopy, gameplay is repetative, and the characters are shallow and almost just a formality. The only highnote is that the multiplayer mode is a lot of fun but to truly experience a range of levels, characters, or weapondry with your friends, you need to play the monotoneous main story. In the end, it is just not worth it. If you are looking for a good Rockstar game, I advise Bully, or GTA. If you want a good western game, buy Gun. It is a lot deeper and cleaner. If you just want a fun game, I highly recomend Destroy All Humans 1 or 2."
5,Red Dead Revolver,"Man, this game is like a cartoon version of a Clint Eastwood movie. I mean, just look at the box! It has a quick-draw system, cool characters, cool characters, and is chock-full of fun stuff to do! I don't care too much for the 2-4 player system, but I think it's a lot better than a lot of games that try to have multiplayer and fail...epically!If you're a fan of cowboys and fun, I'd give this game a try. If not, try it anyway."
2,Tougher than nails,"I love challenging games, that's what makes them fun for me. But this game is too challenging to be fun. I normally spend way to much time playing anyway but I'm ready to return the game and play something else. The game doesn't give you enough pointers to be successful and pretty much starts out hard. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are really patient and use to using the analog sticks for movement."
2,Disappointed.,"I actually bought this AFTER I bought RDR, so I was pretty disappointed with the graphics obviously, but also with the gameplay and the story."
2,Sensor review,The device does not perform as indicated. Main purpose was to use it as a driveway alarm. Device was installed following manufactures instructions. It does not sense a car traveling faster than someone can wall. If does detect someone walking without a problem.
1,Piece of junk,"Hasn't worked a single time since I put it by the driveway. I have had this make alarm before and they worked fine but not this one. I called the manufacturer and they told me there could be no trees, bushes,had to be able to throw a ball from the receiver to the transmitter for it to operate properly. The sales info says it is good up to 900 feet, I don't know anyone that can throw a ball 900 feet, that's 3 football fields. Their reason was they were forced to shorten the antenna by some government regulation. Reguardless it doesn't work!"
5,"have two, buying my third PIR sensor","After having a unit work flawslessly for six months on my front driveway and a second on my rear deck, I am buyung a third sensing unit to place on my front porch. I get no false alarms and very good coverage from each unit. Plenty of warning when a person or car is on your property. The way I have them aimed, the neighborhood (four-legged) critters do not set off the alarms. Very happy with this system."
1,NOT up to the standards of the original,"Beware these must have been farmed out to China for production as they have significantly less range than what was on the market as ""The Reporter"" just a year or more ago. Having owned several reporters and always being pleased we were disappointed when a set of batteries corroded a unit. We bought a replacement package and were shocked that the effective range could no longer work where we had the original system set up. This was approx 300' and now they cannot reach 100'!!! We bought an additional sensor and it to cannot achieve over 100'. The sensors have been downgraded somehow as I've set it up to work with either the old or new base station and the range stinks with either. I understand that advertised ranges are a pipe dream (1200' for this unit) but there is no reason a replacement unit should be of inferior quality to the original."
3,Driveway Alert,Been using this product for over three years. Purchased four sets. One went belly up last year.Sensitivity work better on the low setting if facing traffic even from a distance of over 150ft.More sensitive setting cause a lot of false trigger. Distance is limited. Can't seem to find info on the add on for amplifying the sound on the receiver. Mike
1,Unmitigated piece of crap,"I am returning this replacement sensor today. It does not have the transmission range of the original sensor, and it will not trigger outside of the sensor test mode -- sensor test button pressed. Do not waste any of your life on this time vampire. It does not work."
3,Not as reliable as I had hoped,I recently purchased The Reporter Alert System for my driveway. It was easy to install and fairly simple to set up. The only issue I have is that the system doesn't always work. I have two of the extra sensors directed at my driveway but the system only alerts about half the time. Even after adjusting the sensitivity and locations (repeatedly) I cannot get consistent results. It's very frustrating. Overall still I gave this product 3 out of 5 stars because of price and it's simplicity.
4,Not dependable in Desert temps over 100,Overall a good unit. It is an IR detector (temp diff) in desert hot summer works sometimes and sometimes not. Works good in winter..I added a X10 sensor unit to receiver and it sends a signal to the X10 Ding Dong unit plugged into any wall plug around the house and garage. This will wake you up...The X10 units must be plugged into same ac circuit to work. Most houses have 2 circuits 220V.Note: The detector comes with sensitivity and range set to (on) max (switches down with head pointed to ceiling). After 5 years the plastic lens gets brittle and decreases sensitivity.
1,Crap,"I bought this because a friend's daughter had one and she liked it. I must have been sent a dud because try as I might I couldn't get the system to work. It kept beeping no matter where it was placed. On top of that, it's all plastic with a flimsy wire that's supposed to act as a signal - give me a break. I'd like to know how the unit will continue to work properly after being exposed to icy temperatures and freezing rain - there's no way that the batteries will continue to function. Maybe I should have had it replaced but I didn't. I'm just glad that I got my money back."
1,"A new company? and a product that won't work, minus 1 *","I have the original ""Reporter"" and two sensors that work as advertised, I decided to install a third sensor so ordered from Amazon the new type marked ""Chamberlain"", less money and it doesn't work I guess the name change negated the working ability, I have had it over a year and it worked twice both times when I tied to ""teach"" it to the base station it worked well at that range of a few feet. The originals have wonderful battery life and work as they should even in the cold and snowy Maine Winters and at twice the distance but the newer one,forget it( which is easy because it never goes off)"
2,Product needs improvement,This product is too limited. The alert is a very annoying buzz. The sensors were hard to set and the transmission range was lacking.
5,Making it smarter,"I've had this unit for about a year and it works very well to detect folks coming up my long driveway. I'm still on my first set of used batteries. My only problem is false alarms from deer at night and other ""little forest creatures"". I've decided to get a second transmitter and place it further up the drive. It's unlikely that a deer would trip both alerts, at least not as quickly as a car would, so only the proper sequence of alerts will indicate a real visitor. Either alert alone is just another deer."
3,Don't buy the Chamberlain version,I have used this product for 3 years and it has worked great. 2-year battery life and a long transmission range. I moved the transmitters to a different part of my property after a theft and caught the burglers the next time they came back.I bought a new transmitter (it was the Chamberlain brand) and now my transmitting distance is much less. I need another one of the non-Chamberlain brand transmitters!
3,"Good for cars, not for people",Works great for detecting cars. I'd endorse it as a great product if you have a long driveway and want to know if a car is coming. Not nearly sensitive enough to detect people though.
5,Great Introduction to North American Diatoms,"Vinyard's Diatoms of North America is one of those little gems that generally pass unnoticed by the public but are well known by both professional and amateur biologists. As a professional biologist (who is also an amateur fresh water microscopist) I appreciate such books, which are disappointedly rare. While now almost certainly dated, Vinyard's book remains the classic guide to these fascinating organisms. Diatoms provide a major part of the oxygen that we breathe- a fact that is not generally appreciated- and so are very important to our life on this planet.Vinyard has, in a very short book, admirably summarized the knowledge of North American diatoms to the date of publication (1979) and he uses bold text to highlight unfamiliar terms, which than can be looked up in the glossary. This is in my judgement a model for short handbooks. I recommend it to all microscopists who are interested in aquatic microorganisms."
4,Good Basic Reference,"This book turns out to be a good basic reference to ID of Diatoms. My major in college was Marine Biology and I still have a good collection of prepared slides of Diatoms. My wife got me a good microscope for Christmas this year so I could finally see what was on the slides. To start with, I could remember the diatoms, but not their names. While this book is not a definitive book on diatoms, it is good enough to get me close. I wish it had a better cross reference diagrams to description section. It is in alphabetical order, but reference to actual page would have been nice.Still, very useful."
5,Comical look at the three martini lunch.,"A hilarious account of a day in the life of a business executive in the liver toxifying era of the 1950's three martini lunch. Following W.L. (working lush) through to the morning train and back home again, one gains a new appreciation for art of the walking drunk. Many helpful hints await the curious reader: practice talking to your fellow lushes on the morning train; always grow a plant in your office, thus providing an excuse for a thirst quenching pitcher of water; and never, never drink gin through a straw or you'll not make it past the quarter turn. A classic."
5,Best Seller!!,This book grabs you and doesn't let you go. I could not put it down once I started reading it. As good or better than anything on the recent best seller lists. Mr. Fehrenbach's unique story telling ability conveys the story of his tour in Vietnam directly to you. Five Stars!!*****
5,All rail historians should own this book,I have wirtten seven books on transportation and produced various slide shows and articles on rail history dealing with rail history prior to 1850. This book saves hours no days of research. I am happy to see this book is still for sale!Billie
1,bought 2 neither kept the time,"I bought 2 of these clocks and neither one kept the right time on the clock. Sometimes it would crow in the middle of the night for no reason, scary. I call it my haunted clock."
2,clock doesn't have snooze or volume control,"I don't recommend this clock to anyone because it doesn't have a couple of basic features you need in a talking alarm clock: No snooze and no volume button.The volume is so high that I don't check the time at night for fear of waking everyone else in the house.The alarm, though yells at you at a very high volume, gets turned off at the simple press of the biggest button at the top of the clock. This feature would have been nice if this was a snooze button. However, the clock doesn't have snooze and the alarm will not ring again once you hit that large button in your sleep."
5,jell-o pumpkin spice,"Hands down the best! I mix half of a box in with instant pancake mix and my Grandkids think I'm the Bomb! It's a family tradition from now on. Thank's Jell-o!! Now, can you please make it more available? I'm running out of places to find it. Amazon has been the best so far."
2,odd. tastes too salty. something's wrong here,"I hadn't seen this in California but was visiting family in Georgia and had to pick up a box & try it. Can't recommend it. I enjoy dozens of great pumpkintreats over the holidays and this one, prepared with 2 percent milk not whole milk needs to go back to the drawing board. I found classic turtle, seasonal flavorto try next. Wish me well. . . ."
4,Fantastic...except,"I bought this mostly on an impulse, mostly because I have a rule that between the months of October and November I must try any pumpkin related food I see. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try all that much in the way of pumpkin product this year, so I'm trying to atone. So, Pumpkin Spice Pudding entered my home. This is pretty much one of the greatest pumpkin based items I've ever had save one thing. Why, Jello? Why? Why did you put SO much cinnamon in this stuff? It's *almost* enough to ruin it, but not quite. The fantastic pumpkin flavoring is enough to overwhelm the overuse of the cinnamon, but let this be a lesson on any future editions of this pudding, cut the cinnamon by about half and you have a 5-star product on your hands."
5,A tremendously well written must read!!!,"All 10-15 year olds who enjoy reading books based on the reality of life should read this book. The mess that tangles itself in the first story never completely unwinds, and I believe most who read this book will agree that the family troubles with romances can occur in real life. Some may not realize it, but the author's theme is very real in society today even more than in '85 when the book was first published."
4,This book touched me....,This is one of the best books I ever read. I read it probably 5 time when I was 10-14. The story holds you and stays with you. I recomend it to any young woman who craves romance and an interesting story.
3,It was ok,"I thought that the begining of this book was terrific!! It kept me on the edge of my seat turning page after page, uplifted by the thick romance unfolding. Then all of a sudden it just died and a whole chain of events happened way too quickly. In the second part, the author brought in the ring and continued with the tradition of the Storm family, which was kinda cool. In the last part, I didn't understand why she made it as though the narrator was writing a letter for an English class. It just totally turned me off. I think if she did something with Powell and Mildred in the begining half and had them runaway together that would have made it so much better!!! and more romantic."
5,Best book ever!,"I Stay Near You is one of the best books I have ever read. I read this book my freshman year and I chose to read it again for my high school project. I love this book so much because it shows all the main characters point of views. I have to say that Mildred Cone is my favorite character and that's because she just fascinates me, how she, a poor girl not so pretty or popular, got the rich polite handsome guy that lived over everyone so high."
5,I Stay Near You,M.E. Kerr is a great author. His storys are so good it could pass as a true story. Its so believable. he brings both worlds togethere. Seriously his books are grrrrrrreat!!!! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. This book really opened my eyes. Its really good read it.
4,Nice,This is a nice light weight undergarmet that helps with the side rolls without feeling like you can't breathe all day.
5,Perfect fit.,This was a perfect fit for me and the garment is very comfortable. It was not as elastic as I had expected but I like it anyway. The item arrived before I expected. Good service. I'm going to buy another one in a different color.
4,Book Has Good Information,"This book is easy to read. Montel was very honest about his battle with MS. The back portion of the book contains questions from Montel to various Doctors and their answers. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for information about MS or has been recently diagnosed with MS. Book was delivered way before expected. Overall, a great transaction."
2,Disappointed,"I thought Montel's book was contradictory. On one hand, Montel talks about his growth and empowerment as a result of having MS, while at the same time he comes off as whiny, negative and bitter. I've got MS and although it's not always easy, focusing on the positives in life is extremely important in order to stay as healthy as possible (true in general)!.I do agree with the other reviews talking of Montel's candor and honesty, which is the book's strongest statement. Overall, a rather boring ""all about me"" celebrity memoir. Disappointing from a man of Montel's stature and influence."
1,Great seller,Fast shipping and very reasonably priced. Would definitely do business with this seller again!
1,Montel Feels Sorry For Himself!,"I have seen Montel speak many,many times about his MS symptoms and how he tried to kill himself 2 times! how foolish is he to even think that? Many people have more worse illness'es. I too have MS ,(11years)and have lived with having my feet feel so hot like on fire too but I never give up and always rise to a better fight with each bad day I have.I can hardly see,my sight is really going and I still see the world . I just feel that he is a week man and has no business gathering money and attention for any purpose to fight this disease.enough said....LEAVE IT TO THE PROFESSIONALS..."
1,Don't care what he says,Montel is the most disingenuous person I can think of. Everything he does is self serving. He made public his announcement that he contemplated suicide mere days before the release of his book. If he was to take the torch he would certainly have content on his show about the disease. Instead he chooses to add to the daytime cesspool of television. I myself would never make a purchase that would benefit him.
3,One of the best boxing games made...,"Ready 2 Rumble is a fun game plain and simple. I haven't had this much fun with a boxing game since Mike Tyson's Punch-Out...and R2R expands on every aspect of that NES classic. The only real problem is the longevity of the game. I got tired of the one player game pretty quick, there really is not much to it once you figure out combos and master the Rumble flurries. If you have only a Nintendo, then its a really great buy. But if you have a Dreamcast, buy that superior version. The DC version represnts what R2R really is, fantastic graphics and sound, while the N64 verion is really a step down. The developers did a good job of stripping R2R down to N64's abilitys. It's a good version, but not the quality of the Dreamcast version."
3,Fun at first...but to easy!,This game could have been alot better! The trianing of the boxer is tough and alot of fun! But when it comes to fighting(even on hard)I whipped every boxer all the way to the top within two hours then i lost interest! Although it is alot of fun playing against friends.
2,Ready 2 Rumble misses on the 64,While some people may think this game is great it is onlybecause they have not played the Dreamcast version. The graphics inthis game are lacking and the sound is awful (Hey cartridges don't have CD sound). This game is so good for the Dreamcast it almost makes buying the system a hit. Couple that along with Soul Calibur and your a happy camper. Skip the 64 version and buy the Dreamcast. END
3,too technical for me,"This is an excellent and learned guide to the cuisine of Greece. However we visited Greece and were eager to prepare some of those recipes at home. Not only were the typical Greek-American dishes not included in this book, but the typical taverna food we had in greece was not included either. Technically proficient, but too idiosyncratic for me!"
1,"Nice try, but please try again -- with an index","Kochilas' ""The Glorious Foods of Greece"" is the most frustrating cookbook I've ever tried to use. The theme of a regional Greek cookbook is well taken. However, the utterly useless index renders the book little more than a coffee table book - without photos. And it's a shame, as the recipes themselves are quiet good, but trying to find a recipe is virtually impossible. Or, even worse - trying to find a recipe a second time - was it in the Thessaly chapter? No, no - it must have been the Cyclades chapter. No - perhaps, Epirus. The Complete Book of Greek Cooking by St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church is still the gold standard for a useful Greek cookbook filled with wonderful recipes. Except those who simply enjoy reading cookbooks cover to cover, this is not the one."
3,Good Book,I liked this book though it is quite heavy for cooking with. It is very informative about the Greek way of doing things
2,EXPENSIVE !,I am a fan of the writer and i believe i have all her books. I really enjoy the way she writes and her recipes even most of them are difficult to accomplish and to transform them to a tasty plate. I was expecting in this book to find more simple Greek recipes.To me this is not a normal cookbook but a way to travel around Greece via a cookbook.If this is what you are looking for then this is it!Details about distinctiveness in food of each one of the Greek islands i think they are boring even for a Greek reader like me! Books about Greece with nice pictures and details exist too many and much better than this one who supposed to be a cookbook.And not only this but you can check yourself its price
2,"Excellent Book, But With Faults","The ""Glorious Foods of Greece ...."" is an excellent introduction to the superb cuisine of that ancient land, and, as the title suggests, the subject is treated with all the gusto and enthusiasm that it deserves. However, as is often the case with those affected by an extreme enthusiasm for a particular subject, the author may be tending toward too narrow and rigid concept of what constitutes authentic Greek cooking. Greek cooking not only varies from region to region, but even the same dish may recieve a different treatment dependent on family tradition. Keeping that in mind, it's best to just enjoy that which is set before us for its'own worth without so much forced reference to supposed standards of authenticity."
4,A worthy follow-up,"What some of the early reviewers may be missing is that this isn't Kochilas' first book. She covered the familiar standards in an earlier volume, The Food and Wine of Greece (also available here on Amazon). Glorious Foods is interesting because it takes us a little off the beaten track. But, to me, the real value of Kochilas' books is that she's one of those rare authors (Penelope Casas is another) who knows how to write recipes that WORK. Surely that's worth something.One star off, btw, simply because I'm stingy with five stars. It means I recommend the book highly, but don't consider it a ""must have."""
2,Too long winded,"....and too depressing for my liking, and I couldn't finish the book. There were some highlights, but mostly it was depressing."
4,masterpiece,"Another in the Jarrow trilogy that is as good if not better than the others, it is hard to pick the best as they are all excepional."
5,Fantastic!,"This would be a great present for any senior. The exercises are easy to do, they are presented clearly with lots of helpful health tips and there are a great variety of exercises. This will keep seniors loose, flexible and strong. (I am not a senior but tried the exercises. I think they are great for anyone). It's a shame the way many seniors degenerate so quickly. If they practiced exercises like these, they could stay active throughout their lives. And as I said, it wouldn't hurt for us youngins to stay flexible."
3,"Instruction fine, disappointed in the camera work","I received this video today. I purchased it based on the glowing reviews I'd read here. Let me say I thought the instruction was fine: very clear, slow, easy to follow (4 stars for that). Unfortunately the video itself I would rate no higher than a good amateur production. The quality and clarity of the video and sound were fine. However it looks like it was shot in a carpet warehouse - two oriental carpets on the floor (which he has to straighten out at times because they curl up) and possibly a large one behind as a backdrop! But even that's OK. The most annoying thing is that on a number of occasions when he is describing a new move/exercise they zoom into his face and you can't see what he is doing with his hands/feet. At other times when he is discussing body alignment they stay focused on his legs and you miss the arm movements.Overall: instruction is fine, setting could be better, but some of the camera work is really annoying."
1,Warning: Won't play on some DVD players,"I wish I could have posted this without a rating, because the sole purpose is to alert potential buyers.I would love to have had the chance to view this DVD. However, it won't play on my standard Sony DVD player (this is the first time anything like this has happened).So, while the DVD may be fantastic, you MIGHT have a problem viewing it. Hopefully the DVD's producer will read this and resolve the issue.Sorry to be a killjoy..."
1,"Poor picture quality, poor content","The picture quality of this video is EXTREMELY poor, very grainy and obviously homemade with no production values. Content is thin and not well presented, there just isnt much here. If it was cheap it might be passable, but his price on this is way out of line. You'd be money ahead with a book."
4,"Cheesy production, but good for arthritis","If you have severe arthritis, arthritis in numerous joints or both and haven't been exercising lately, this inexpensive instant video might be right for you. I usually cringe when I watch yoga or other tai chi videos because I know my knees, back, neck, hands, wrists, etc. can't handle it. This one, however, seems to hit the right notes for a beginner. While I hope to progress to something more rigorous, this video is something I can do NOW. The initial stretches/exercises are easy to follow and do. The final exercises are more complicated and are harder for a klutz like me to nail down, but they can still be modified to the condition of my body. From a production prospective, it looks like it was filmed in the late 70's in someone's finished basement, but glitz isn't something I need. Try renting it for 7 days to see if it will work for you."
3,VERY SLOW PACE,I found this video very slow. I would rate myself below average on the mobility chart(a 4 on a scale of 1-10). For me this video was to slow paced. The content was good but just didn't have the challenge needed to keep me motivated. The instructor although very informative was also lacking any motivational skills. It seemed to me that he was very uncomfortable in front of a camera. I used this DVD a few times and opted to return to a beginners tape which was more interesting and more challenging.

4,Couch Potato no more,"I have been on disability for approx 4 yrs. I have not moved since i stopped working and this is a blessing. I am 52 y/o and am concerned about losing flexibility and grace. With this type of movement, I can work on getting the felxibility without killing myself"
1,NO AC ADAPTOR,"I WAS CUT OFF THE LAST TIME I TRIED TO LEAVE A MESSAGE. SO, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT. YOUR 149.99 PRICE IS $185.54 BY THE TIME YOU PAY TAXES, SHIPPING AND HANDLING. THE KEYBOARD DOES NOT INCLUDE AN AC ADAPTOR. I AM TOLD THEY ARE AROUND $30.00 AND IF YOU BUY THE WRONG ONE IT WILL BLOW UP YOUR KEYBOARD. WE ARE GOING TO TRY OUR BEST TO RETURN THIS TO TARGET. YOU SHOULD BE NOTIFIED OF THE EXTRA COST AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT COME WITH AN AC ADAPTOR. BATTERIES ONLY LAST ABOUT 6 HOURS."
5,Great for Backups,I purchased this to back up files off my hard drive and for moving files from one computer to another. It has great memory space and is easy to use.
3,"OK, But Not Great.","Since I do not have military training, this is good material for me. It picks specific events of past wars to support the principles been discussed. Actors and pictures are used to illustrate the narration. Not a prize-winner, but it makes the point well.However, the narrator objectivity is questionable, and thus, the presentation's merit. For instance, in several occasions he claims ""Sun Tzu predicted the outcome of the Vietnam War and the Ally Landing in Normandy"" No evidence of such prediction is shown (Of course; from 600BC) So, how much of this is fluff?"
2,Review of Fodor's Martha's Vineyard,"As a regular traveller, I was most disappointed with the latest edition of Fodor's 2000: Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket. It was very concise in its information about the area, but as one who arranges travel, shopping, and accommodation over the internet, I was amazed that in the Year 2000 edition, it completely lacked any web sites/addresses. For instance, Martha's Vinyard Chamber of Commerce has the most informative web site for local travel, accommodation, weather, etc., but Fodor's has not listed it, just the 1-800 phone number...coming from London, England, this is of little help. Unfortunately, this was the case throughout the whole book. Fodor succeeds in its advice and desciptions, but it may want to think about updating its books for the millions of global web surfers out there, wanting to plan a holiday"
4,Preach the Word of God with Passion and Conviction,"There is no doubt that Dr. Shaddix is passionate about his Jesus and sharing His Word! Pastors and aspiring preachers, get this as a tool to help you sharpen your preaching of the Word of God. It is a grounded work.My rating is based on a reading of only several chapters of the book. I fully intend on reading the rest of the book to gain more insight and to help me present the Word of God better with the Spirit driving it all."
5,Every You Need to Know About Dressing Dollhouse Dolls is in This Book,"This is a great book with tips, hints, patterns, easy-to-follow instructions, and lots of great photographs. Anyone from beginner to advanced can learn from and use this book."
5,Hurray for Sue Atkinson!,"This is the most useful book possible for anybody interested in making dollhouse dolls and dressing them appropriately and authentically. Everything is covered in this very practical book. Directions are clear. Materials are shown and described, and all the steps are illustrated clearly. Very highly recommended."
4,GL Cooleo,"This game is great! The handling is cool and so is the combat and magic combat. I, personally, would reccomend this game for Legend lovers , ya' know, magic. The buttons are great and so are the graphics."
5,Amazing!,I played this game before and I think its a pretty good choice of buying.Pretty good graphics too.If you think you have to check this one out for the kids you really dont it shows barely an blood.This Game Is Amazing!!!
4,A remake of a classic nintendo game,"The 3d environment, was an inprovement of the classic 2d environment but the birds eye view still gave me the same classic feeling of playing the original gauntlet game. A couple of times the view would spin and disoriantate you a little. But There was no other way to give you this great veiw without the ocasional spin to correct the oriantation of veiw. I was disapointed in the number of levels in the game but other than that I thought I was a great remake of a classic nintendo game."
4,Gauntlet Legends: A Great Multiplayer Game,"I have played this game for about 3 weeks and this game has been great. The graphics are great with the expansion pac and it is a fun game for friends. It may pay a tax on your patience with the puzzles it makes you do, especially on multiplayer, but besides that it is fun enough to relearn all the sharing you learned on Sesame Street(tm) while saving the world. For parties, it would get enoying to get everybody playing by switching off, but for 2-4 it is great. As for the single player game, it can get boring fast for those of lesser tempers, but overall this game is exciting and adventurous."
4,Best Game Ever,"I shouldn't be the one to say this but GL is totally cool. If you are looking for a challenging game with wizards,archers,warriors,knights and things like that let me tell ya' YOUR SEARCH IS OVER! The Graphics are great. Many levels, tons of places to go! I suggest that everyone everywhere with a N64 should buy this game. I know this because I have it and it is great!!!!! They also let yo play as ponjo the chicken just put EGG as your name, and your password as 911. Now Go and BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Un-Beatable!!!,"I went over to my friends house for a sleep over and the whole time we were there we did nothing but this game. When i got back home, i made two trips to blockbuster to try to rent it, then just ordered it off amazon. it is the BEST game as far as gameplay and theme, but could use some work on graphics and sound. This is DEFINETLY worth the money."
5,This Game Is HOT!!!!!!!!!!,"I have only played the arcade version once, and this one is 100% better. I got hooked on it by a friend and neighbor and cannot stop. The graphics are awesom, and 4 players can all play together on the same screen, none of that that split screen junk. Okay, the music isn't all that great and the the sound effects reapeat a little, but it's still better than alot of games, not giving any names...There are 5 hidden characters through-out the well planned realms. This game is well worth your time and money. planned realms. All I can say now is.... ENJOY!!!!!"
4,Arcade version is a LOT better...,"I played Gauntlet Legends for N64 back when it came out about 3 months ago. It was just eh. I would have given it 3 stars. After playing the arcade version, I thought different of it. The arcade game was perfect. Probably because I had quarters at stake though. It also had FMVs and the graphics looked a heck of a lot better. I understand the N64 can't support FMVs, but that's not that important. The graphics are just okay in the N64 version. If you love the game and want it now, get the N64 version. If you like the FMVs and superb graphics, wait till the Playstation version comes out."
2,"Good game, Better on Arcade","The game itself is good, But it isnt very disireable on the Super Nintendo Platform. It is a much better game to play in the Arcade. you have greater control of what your doing."
5,"A great, intricate game.","Gauntlet Legends is a great game. It is an amazingly crafted multi-player game. The game play is extremely dense, and will take a long time to plow through, as well as throw challenging puzzles at you. The graphics are top notch, and the sound and music are excellent. Being able to save and pump up characters adds an incredible amount of replay, and makes the game deeper. Over all, it is just an awesome game!"
5,A Blast,"This game is so much fun! It is great for both one person and up to four people! The game it self is very challenging from the begining up to the very end! With so many levels, this game is on a level of its own! I would highly recomend this game to other fans of games like Zelda."
4,Gauntlet legends review,This game is awesome. The controls are pretty easy to learn and the game play is slow enough to let you focus but its fast enough to keep you concentrated. Also the enemies and power-ups are really cool. The bosses are neat too all having their own special attacks. You can find certain items in the levels that will help you beat the bosses a lot more quickly. Believe me I tried to beat the bosses without certain things you pick up in the levels in nooks and crannies(example:the ice ax of Untar)and it was alot harder! I would have had to be at least at level 30 to just be able to contend with the first boss. The level growing also makes it fun. Finding the powerups and using them is cool too. Good luck!!!
5,A Great Game For All,The game is great for multi playing. The options make it easy to play with your friends. I found it very entertaining. It was a refreshing up grade fro the old arcade game.
5,Best Game Ever!,Gaunlet Legends the best game ever one word BEST most Fun game Best Expansion Pak Game and Best Multiplayer Game I don't care if only 3 players can play without the Expansion Pak cause I only have 3 controllers
2,Gauntlet Legends,"Gauntlet Legends is O.K.,but there is nothing to do in it. It is soooo boring. You do the same thing through the entire game. I only give it 2 stars.=o("
4,An ethical dilemma,"""Defending Donald Harvey"" goes beyond the standard true-crime/serial killer genre, by showing us the ethical dilemma of an honest man who is also a shrewd attorney, trying to simultaneously discharge his responsibilities to his client and to his community. It also allows us to glimpse the residual humanity behind Donald Harvey's significant pathology. I highly recommend this book."
5,I Couldn't Put It Down,I could not stop reading this book which reads like a novel. What a well-written book which gives a concise account of this bizarre person! The book is very well organized and gives enough information but not too much information. Hard to believe this is a true story and what a fascinating story it is. Also gives insight into all that Mr. Whalen went through during the course of this investigation. A quick and haunting read!
4,Surprising and subtle,"I really didn't know what to expect from this fudge. I bought it to tip my cart over $25 to get free shipping since I had about 3 dollars left and couldn't think of what else to get! What a random purchase! I had been eyeing the clotted cream in the supermarket and it looks delicious. I have not actually had it! But, it really looks like heavy cream upon heaps of heavy cream, which does sound yumm. So therefore I expected a decidedly milkly, light-textured fudge, like vanilla, but it's more the color of caramel, smells like caramel and only the after-taste has a cream-like flavor. Very surprising, subtle, but I think I like it!"
3,An Aquired Taste,My first impression upon first tasting Buchanan's Clotted Cream Fudge is it's lack of candy like sweetness. It is more of a milky flavor with a sort of buttery overtone. I personally like it and will buy more. Try it if your tastes run to a little more sophisticated flavors.
2,...Am I The Only One..,....Embarrased for the lot of them..?...Pretty Pathetic...Remember Scollay Square & The Old Howard..?..!..Well i do have Betties autographed 8X10...RIP Bettie..!
3,good text /bad maps,"Maps are almost useless. Examples: on pg.31 # 39 is put no. of Sunset, when it is south, next to # 53 & 55. as per text pg. # 59. On pg. # 74 Beverly Glen Blvd. is shown as Sunset Blvd. Sunset is not labeled at all. On pg.106 #11 is shown in a insert of downtown L. A. Malvern ave. is in Brentwood approx. 15 mi. west of map location. Maps are poor at best needs much better reasearch."
2,The Tinseltown Hustle,"Geez, don't people get tired of this...most of these guides, including this one, are out of date and often misleading, with poor maps and when you do find a home they are often obscured by a fence or hedge or whatever, neighborhoods like Bel Air and Beverly Hills north of Sunset are designed for privacy, with their twisting roads and canyons, that's why so many celebrities make this area their home. I realize that many people come to L.A. looking for celebrities and it is fascinating to see where they may or may not live, but here's some advice, go running on the beach in Malibu or go to Sky Bar or certain neighborhood grocery stores if you really want to see a star, they shop and go out to eat like everyone else, and you can buy a disposable camera with which to take their picture with the money you save by not purchasing this book."
5,Stetson Boots,"I didn't even know where to purchase Stetson boots, when you're site came up I was so-o-o-o happy! They are just what I was looking for and at a very good price, Even nicer!Thanks for your outstanding service."
3,"Beautiful set but, fades","I paid clearance price for this so I am willing to give this at least a 3 star rating. This bedding set does fade after a couple washes, I would not pay full price ($380?) for it. The bedding has stayed together, I had this set for maybe a year before giving it away. I still have the pillows though, they are still in great shape!"
4,Value for money,"This comforter is a cool deal for 29.99 bucks, definitely a value for this price. They increased the price by 20 $ now but its still a good deal. It ships really quick and you will surely like the looks and feel of this item."
3,"Shaken, not stirred","I'm tired of cocktail shakers that leak. The Metrokane showed up in a couple reviews as non-leaky, so I gave it a try.Verdict? Well, it's pretty good about not leaking, but this is not a five-star shaker. The big problem is that when you put the top on so you can give your ingredients a shake, even the lightest touch causes the thing to grip down so tightly that it's nearly impossible to remove. I guess that tight grip is what fights leakage.To the cocktail shaker makers of the world: when you want a leak-proof seal, try using a rubber gasket. It's not really a revolutionary idea. Give me a lid that screws down onto a rubber gasket and I'll be happy. Until then, I limp along with just-okay products like this one.Of course, the art deco styling makes my kitchen counter look very au courant."
3,Not as good as expected,"This shaker is okay... it looks great, thats for sure... Unfortunately if you shake it hard the ""strainer"" piece starts moving from the main piece and if your not careful they'll come apart and make a big mess...5-stars for looks2- starts for functionality"
1,Is this designed for one-time use?,"Impressive appearance but completely non-functional. I have been unable to establish the proper angle, force, or twist to remove the strainer the next morning after a single use, never mind the same day. It is as if this was designed to be used with warm liquids; since once I have put on the strainer top for more than 5 seconds with an ice and cocktail mixture, the strainer top will not yield its grip and cannot be reused. Applying hot water does nothing. I have been tempted to try vise-grips but that would damage it. Even the few times I have managed to remove the top for proper cleaning, the same method does not work the next time. Don't bother, spend more money and get one that works. On the good side, with melted water left in it for hours or days it hasn't rusted and it definitely does not leak. I rate reuse higher on the design goals, however."
2,Same old same old.,"A collection of short stories should try to avoid repetitions. Too many of the stories were formulaic: I rode bikes as a girl, I got married, my husband was a troll, I got divorced, and now my bike gives my life meaning. There must be fifteen stories with this story line. Ladies, you can do better than that."
5,a good casual read,this is a good book If you are looking for an average person writing about their own experiences with bikes. I personally loved it but that was just me. I like reading about others who share the same passion I have.
4,Happy with purchased item and delivery,"I love live music and this is one of the best - Big Jack Johnson live is totally enjoyable. I've been trying to coordinate my travel with Big Jack's appearances but have not had any luck, so this is the next best thing."
2,Mmmmm....,I love live blues. I love Big Jack. BUT the audio quality onalmost every other track is appalling and this CD should never have been released.
1,"Try, try again...","Thought I'd review this while I was on hold for customer support. This unit worked for about 3 months, then filled up with rain water, and then shut down. I can't believe they don't make this weather proof! No rubber back gasket, no seal around the antennae... The whole unit just felt ""cheap"". I'm sending the broken product back, and will let you know if the replacement was on time and if it worked."
5,drive way notice The Reporter Wireless Alert System,"The Reporter Wireless alert System, is Made in the USA, yes not some place else. It is made with old fashion Craftsmanship and Great Customer Service. I have Noting that works as good as ""The Reporter"" It is great. Holds up in the weather, something you can count on."
5,This alert works perfectly!,"When I purchased the ""reporter"", I didn't think it would amount to much since it was so inexpensive compared to some of the others I looked at, but I don't think you could buy a better driveway alert system at ANY price! I has never failed to alert me to a vehicle coming up my driveway, and the occasional dog, deer, or someone walking that will set it off is also fine with me! Excellent product!"
1,not happy with.,"Worked fine for about one week, then quit working. Called company and they sent me to the people it was purchased from for warranty. Have not received any response from them (Gizmos for life) on what they will do. Sent another e-mail today, see what happens. Will not purchase on-line electronics ever again."
1,Mike,Purchased this product as a replacement for the REPORTER driveway alarm. The batteries leaked and distroyed the insides. This alarm appeared to be the same other than the name. Looks the same and everything. I got the alarm and installed it in the same place as the other one but I couldn't get it to work. The sensor is about 400 feet from the base. I could only get the alarm to sound when I moved it to closer then 200 feet. Returned it the next day. Going back the the REPORTER brand.
1,Don't waste your time with this.,"Claims of 900 feet are completely and utterly overblown for real world applications. I couldn't get 40 feet of reception with the receiver inside the house. Perhaps if I put the receiver in direct line of sight outdoors I could have gotten better reception, but gee, then I wouldn't be able to hear the buzzer! Very cheap construction, no seal on the outdoor sending unit, etcetera etcetera. I wasted about 2 hours today trying to get it to work and then giving up and trying to stuff it back in the box. Grrrrr! I'm going to try the Dakota at twice the price..."
5,Works Great and Price is Right!!!!,We replaced a Dakota that failed [after many years] with the Chamberlain. It is less expensive and works perfectly. The biggest plus the sound is loud enough to hear but not annoying- I jumped everytime the other alarm went off!
1,This is a piece of junk,I purchased two of these units over the course of a year and each one just stopped working. Do not buy one of these units.
1,Not so good,"I'm sorry but this one just doesn't work it goes off sometimes but not others. I set it up per the instructions IE distance,height,angle still does not work correctly. I have two other brands that work fine."
1,Junk Junk Junk,Would not pick up anything beyond 6 feet away when it picked up anything at all.. Cheap! Just plain junk.. Don't waste your time with this driveway alarm!Company had to comply with FCC rules and cut the units motion detection drastically!My motion lights pick up more then this thing will!
1,Don't do it!,"This works intermittently. You have to have a clear line of sight between the outside and inside device. If you get anything metal in between it seems to stop working. Even when it does work, the alarm is so quiet you can't hear it. It says you can connect a doorbell to it, but Radio Shack couldn't figure out how to do so and no one answers their tech support line at Chamberlain. Overall, I wish I hadn't. I think I have had it too long to return now, playing with it trying to get it to work. THUMBS DOWN!"
2,What a disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this item as I live on a large property with a long driveway. At first I was amazed how cheaply the item was made (what is wrong with making a product from metal instead of crummy plastic?) Not a good sign. After setting it up, the best range I could get was maybe 50 feet. And there were no obstacles! Don't waste your time or money like I did."
1,Not what I'd hoped,"The range of the motion sensor is more like 8 feet, not 30 feet. We bought this in hopes of alerting us to someone being in our driveway trying to break into our cars. It failed miserably. We also bought an extra sensor that I was going to test out in the back yard to warn us if someone was in it. Failed miserably again.I guess this product would be fine if you have a long narrow driveway and were using it much like you would an electric eye. Probably be okay for that but useless for anything else. I can't believe the reviews that said it was so great!"
3,works for the driveway,"this product works well on our driveway to tell us when company is coming. Although, it wont pick up my husbands car when he comes in faster than usual, but otherwise it works fine. Even lets me know when the dog is leaving the yard."
2,Not happy with this unit,"I wasn't satisfied with this unit. It detected motion about 50% of the time. I tried moving it to a different location, adjusting the sensor to no avail. Its a shame too because as much as this unit costs, it should perform better.I ended up buying a slightly more expensive unit that has performed flawlessly and it also gives me the capability to add 6 more sensors. Spend your money once and be done with it."
1,Don't buy this product...,"Bottom line on this one...I spoke with Chamberlain before I returned this back to Amazon. A supervisor flat out told me that after they bought out the original company the FCC told them that the sensor didn't meet regulations and they had to ""modify things"". These modifications mow reduced the effective range from the advertised 900ft to maybe if you are lucky just over 100ft. The supervisor even told me to return the item back to Amazon for a refund. So if a 50ft range works for you then have at it. But the box and the instructions still state a 900ft range which is absolutely false according to Chamberlain. They claim that there should be a disclaimer in the box, but there was none in my box. I believe that Amazon should also be on notice and state this info.Anyway, I would advise that if you want to be alerted when a vehicle is more than 50ft from your house, don't buy this product."
2,Chamberlain motion alarm,Item was defective. Returned to Amazon for credit. Amazon was very helpful with return policy and credit.
3,Okay for the price and a few let downs as well.,Product was easy to install but has a few draw backs.I am not quite sure of the 900' advertised range unless it is directly line of sight with no obstructions.Both the transmitter and the receiver are very cheaply built. I am concerned about how long the transmitter will survive Indiana outside as their is no weather seal or protection inside the cheap plastic housing.The receiver has a generic sounding buzzer and the volume is non-adjustable.Overall it will get the job done but it feel's like something I would expect to get from Billy Mays @ $19.99 with a free tube of mighty putty!
1,Cheap and doesn't work,If the sensor was within 27' of the base unit it worked great. No where near the 1200' they claim. And don't expect it to pick up cars...only slow moving people.
1,2nd set and still have trouble,The first Chamberlain worked for about two years and then slowly started screwing up. Finally quit all together. I bought a new one from Amazon.com and it won't register after about 100'. Maybe if I start testing between the two sets I'll find out what part is not funcitioning properly???? I just don't have the time to mess with it and it's too much hassle to send back. Probably wont ever buy another.Kevin
3,Driveway Alert,"This item pretty much works as designed, I have it installed on my driveway that is about 400 ft from my house. I have adjusted it several times and it does not altert 100% of the time. It seems as though when it is raining it will not detect a car coming in the driveway. Other times it works most of the time. I am considering senting it back for something that works a little better."
1,Chamberlain wireless alarm dosen't work,"The Chamberlain wireless alarm -300r does not work when the motion sensor is mounted 90 ft from the base station !(it's advertised to work at 900 ft.)I believe it's underpowered---competitor's work at 3000ft. Chamberlain sent another unit, but it was no better ! I'm stuck with these worthless units, since it has been more than 30 days since I received the first one."
1,Not worth the money,"I do not recommend this sensor.It emits many false alarms during daylight hours due to reflected sunlight, rendering it useless. I plug it in only after sunset. Even in nighttime, moreover, it falsely responds to lightning.Don't waste your money.Chamberlain The Reporter Wireless Alert System #RWA-300R"
1,2nd purchase of same product does not work,"Purchased a second driveway alarm and it works sporadically....Last one purchased lasted 3 years but even with repositioning , new batteries, different outlets, ect. just does not work. Very dissappointed..."
1,Piece of junk,"This worked fine for about 1 week then it stopped working. I had it under an overhang so it never got wet, I assume when it rains it might last 1 day. It's a total piece of junk, probably cost $ 2.00 to make in US dollars. I'm getting a pit bull instead !"
2,Who is in my driveway?,"For the last 10 years we didn't know anyone was approaching our cabin until they knocked on the door catching us unaware. Once we got the Wireless Pedestrian and vehicle alert installed and working our problems were solved. Now our biggest challenge is trying to see who is coming only to see a family of skunks , raccoons or deer are about to arrive."
4,"""The Reporter"" reports, sometimes","I affixed the reporter to a tree trunk a few feet from my driveway so that it would alert me of vehicles driving up. For some reason, it almost never detects certain cars, and always detects others. This could be because I need to aim the unit lower (maybe the signal passes through the windows and doesn't pick up the thinner opaque parts on the upper part of the car?), but I didn't want it picking up animals going by.One other problem that I have is that the batteries seem to last only a month or so. And the alarm is pretty loud - you don't want it in the same room with you while you sleep unless you really want it to wake you up!When The Reporter is working, it seems to work well and will send the signal over a long distance as advertised. It's a good deal for the low price, but I wouldn't trust it completely."
4,"Effective, easy to install and use","The Reporter Wireless Alert System was easy to install and works flawlessly. We use it to provide an alert when cars enter our long driveway. I connected the output on the receiver to the doorbell feature in our home intercom, so now the ""side door"" signal rings throughout the house when someone enters the library. The only challenge has been playing with the sensitivity settings on the sensor/transmitter to minimize false alarms -- presumably mostly from deer. The distance between transmitter (at the end of the driveway) and the receiver (in the attic) is about 75 yards, and there is no problem with the wireless signal."
5,Works great!,I live on a country road and cannot always see who is arriving in my dooryard; this alert has been great as it gives me time to check out my window to see who is here before I go to the door... Very easy to set up (at least that is what my husband tells me)...
1,Alert System review,Device does not perform as advertised. I purchased system primarly for a drive way alarm. The sensor does not pick up a car or truck if it is traveling faster than a person walks. It does pickup a person or animal walking. The inside alarm device is not very loud. The range of the device as advertised (900 feet) is also questionable. I could not get it to work over 100 feet even with new batteries.
1,Review of Driveway Sensor,I am not happy with this product at all. It does not preform as advertised. Literature says it works up to about 1/4 mile. I have it positioned not quite 250 feet away and can not get it to work. If I bring it to within about 20 feet it works fine. That is not what I ordered it for. I am about to the point of sending it back.
1,Not as good as the old one,"This is my second reporter. The new one, after being taken over by Chamberlain, has a much shorter wireless range, in fact, in my situation it is worthless. It will not transmit 500 feet with a direct line of sight.They have also reduced the alert tone so that it is much harder to hear in a different room."
3,Not as good as I hoped.,The unit has not got the range claimed by the instructions. I've had to move the sensor next to my house. I have also noticed that it picks up people walking much better than cars driving up my driveway.
1,Piece of junk,"I'll try to be brief. I bought this for my parents for the driveway. We tried several locations, positions, angles, etc. Nothing seemed to work. I was skeptical as soon as I took it out of the box because it looked and felt cheap. And it is. We spent about half of X-mas day trying to get this stupid thing to work. It never worked right. I sent it back and Amazon promptly processed a refund. I then bought the Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit and tried it today for the first time. So far, it is working much better than this piece of junk. Hope this is helpful."
2,Alert System,The alert system worked for a couple of days. Now it's unplugged and in the corner waiting to be thrown away or re-tried. Don't waste your money..spend a little more and buy something better.
1,RATING OF ZERO IF POSSIBLE,RATING OF ZERO IF POSSIBLE--I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER SET TO HOPEFULLY HAVE AT LEAST ONE SOUND OFF---MANY TIMES NEITHER SOUNDS OFF FOR CARS COMING OR GOING. THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.
2,No good POS,"This has not worked for me since day one. I bought it specifically because of the range. Originally had it at the end of my 350 foot driveway and never triggered unless I had the base in my hand. Moved the base to the nearest room in the house, did not help. Re-adjusted the angle etc. Moved the transmitter 200 feet closer, STILL does not go off. I dont know what part is the weak link, the transmitter or the reciever. I would love for this to work as advertised. How can I get help? Anyone has some ideas, let me know! [...]"
1,wireless alert System,It did not ever work as advertised. It did not work with more than 100 feet separation and even then not all of the time.
5,Wireless Alert System,It works very well. It gives a real sense of security and was easy toset up. Does not pick up deer or turkey so it is not annoying! Weare very happy with this roadway protection. Would recommend to anyonein an isolated area.
3,Works well but mounting is difficult,"It is green so that it is camouflaged when placed in bushes. Does a good job of alerting when either vehicles or persons enter driveway. However, mounting it is a real problem. Access to the battery compartment is through the back so it is necessary to dismount the Sensor to install batteries and that is a real job. Mounting it is also difficult because the screwholes on the back plate are blocked by the Sensor. The batteries last about a year. Our sensor quit after two years."
1,disappointment,The alerter constantly reported false signalsThe distance was short compared to what was advertised
2,Within 1000 ft. range but no sound,I have placed the sensor at the beginning of my drive way. The distance from there to the receiver is probably around 325 ft and it isn't picking up any movement. I'm very disappointed. I do not have anywhere else to place the sensor while keeping in concealed.
1,Signal too low; no volumn control -- not happy with system.,The alert signal is not loud enough to hear over a TV or from another room. The suggested remedy is to connect the unit to something louder. This is not a realistic solution or as compared to other much louder systems. I also purchased a system for my aunt who has a similar complaint. We are returning both of them plus the extra sensor I ordered.
4,Possible problem and solution,"I returned two systems because they failed to turn on after turning them off. I think that the off button was pressed twice accidentally. In removing the battery from the last one, I discovered that it reset the system and fixed it. This is not in the instructions. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the product and now will consider buying a second for security of our travel trailer."
2,Worked off and on for a year,"And then of course, the month after the Warranty was over, it quit completely. I took it apart and found a lot of moisture, the batteries were corrided, and cannot get it to work. I cleaned it up, let it set in the house to dry per the instructions and changed batteries. Now the wiring seems to be messed up. I emailed the manufacturer to see if I could buy replacement parts, but they did not respond."
4,Works Well !,"Nice little notification unit. Placed at end of long drive, and before anyone can get past that point, I am notified. Well worth the money."
1,Bought on good ratings but it does not work,"I bought one of these because I read the feedback, But I will tell you, This does not last. Had it for 3 months and now it sends a signal every 2 seconds, even face down and covered. I have an electronics background and this product is way too unstable. The manufacturer does not answer emails either."
3,Had for Several Years,"Live on a long driveway in the country. Our sensor is about 100' from unit in house and reception is fine. Have had number of false alarms - nearly all in the daytime - which we never figured out what sets it off. I've witness it go off with no outside triggers (wind, birds, dogs, spiders, dementors.) Go figure. However, no vehicle or person has gone passed it with out setting it off and that's what counts! I have glued a large PVC pile coupling over the sensor that limits the alarm area so it won't pick up the neighbors using their driveway (the pipe or the neighbors aren't the cause of the false alarms). Taping or caulking the joint of the sensor also helps keep moisture out. I'd buy another but the false alarms lower it to a 3 rating."
4,Nice Product but range is limited to around 250 feet.,"We have a 300 foot driveway and the product description stated it worksup to 900 feet between the transmitter and receiver. We thought thiswould be perfect. With the receiver inside on the main floor we were only getting about a 100' range in direct sight range through a window. With the receiver sitting on the window sil upstairs we managed to get about 250' of direct sight range. Not quite what we were hoping for but it works, we just have less warning that we hoped for."
1,"A Waste of money and time, POS.","If you can see it and no more than 21 feet it will work. Will not work inside home to alert that someone enter driveway, @ 15feet !!! TOTAL A WASTE of time and money for me !!! ps I had to give it one star to rate it, would like to take that one star back."
2,NOT VERY HAPPY,"NOT VERY HAPPY. All the review gave it a 4 star.I can't,sometime it works sometime it dosen't."
4,Nice little unit,"This device works fine although it would be nice if there was a volume control (the option of more volume). It is sometimes hard to hear, especially if one is not in the same room as the receiver. KC"
1,Transmitter Defective,"I installed this item on a vacation cabin. It functioned for about 2 days, then constantly went into ""alarm"". After several troubleshooting attempts, I concluded the transmitter of this item is defective. (I have installed this item before w/no problems) As I have misplaced my PO for this, hopefully the seller will offer a replacement."
1,Problems with this system,"I got the annunciator w sensor and 2 xtra sensors. Annunciator signal tone high pitch, a freq that i can hardly hear, low vol. Individual sensor alarms could not be set nor recognized. All sensors were set for 30 feet. 1 sensor functioned only at 3'. Another at about 0-10. The other usually did not function. No sensor functioned consistently. The best sensor failed completely to register my walking in front of it about 20% of the time. As a personnel intruder system, this set i got was useless. Sent it back to Amazon."
1,This was supposed to be the one....,"I bought the reporter and an extra transmitter...In hopes to provide detection of any thing coming up my drive at a maximum of 12 feet. The second transmitter would help detect any one coming to the door. I was defective and would couse the receiver to chime every 5 to 8 seconds even if I placeed it into a box. The other transmitter on a good day detect at 5 feet and that was'nt consistant. Went through all the tech support calls and played with the sensitivity settings new batteries...still no luck getting it to work as per the manufactures comments...I even tried the OPtex it was no better and cost twice as much...I finally found a product from Skylink HA-318 which has great range...I can easily detect up to 35 too 40 feet...It is more sensitive to picking up raccoons, cats, foxes and this gray hound dog....So I use it with the motion lights to help determine want cause the trigger..."
1,shipped with 1/2 the parts,"This item was shipped with only half the parts, and could not be installed. I am still waiting to hear back from the manufacturer"
2,Year Long Test.,I purchased 1 main base and 2 sensors...... and it has been a little over a year since I have operated them. Since there are more Cons: I'll start with them; 1. The alarm is not very loud. 2.The sensors really eat up batteries. 3. it wasn't effective greater than 25 ft. 4.They didn't work well in the cold -- freezing and below.5. One of the sensors appeared as if it was oscillating ..... that's when I trashed it.Pro : It was a good test of my patience !I do not recommend this product.
1,"It works but,","The unit works but don't think it's going to work much more the 130 feet away from the base unit. From the road to my house it's about 130 feet. I set the system up with the base unit in a window in a hallway. It's a clear shot with no trees, plants or buildings in the way. The base unit wouldn't work. I moved the base unit to a bedroom window which shorten to distance up by about 15 feet and the it worked And one more thing to note the new batteries lasted 3 weeks."
1,Waste of money,"The claimed range is up to 1200 feet. It barely works at 50 feet with a clear shot from antenna to antenna. Most of the time it will not alert when a car passes it, but will alert when an animal walks by it. It is so unreliable that we do not pay attention to it. I am going to go back to the magnetic field type drive way alerting systems."
1,Trying to Find One that Works,"While I highly compliment Chamberlain's Customer Service Department for working with me, the product has MUCH to be desired. They have sent me 4 units trying to find one that works. I put in the 4th one this week-end and it does not work. I am coming close to my frustration level, but will continue to work with them trying to find one that works. I now wish I had just bought one locally so I could talk with somebody and get it worked out. I have not been happy thus far."
2,Poor performance,"This unit works intermittently although it's only about 75ft from the base unit. I installed a secondary transmitter at a different location in the yard about 200ft from the receiver, and it never has worked. -Disappointed"
2,Not as good as used to be,"This used to be a great system; however, when I had to recently replace a transmitter it didn't perform as good as the older ones. The range on the new transmitter is less than a third of the older ones."
1,Very Poor Range,I had one of these and returned it. I set it up about 700 feet from my house and it wouldn't go off. They say the range is 900 feet. I removed the sensor and walked toward the house stopping every few feet and setting off the sensor with my hand while my wife listened for the alarm. I know the sensor went off because the green light on the sensor flashed. I had to get within 30 feet of the window where the base station was before the alarm would go off. This was with brand new batteries in the remote unit. My house has wooden studs and wooden window frames so it wasn't metal blocking the signal. I'm sorry but it just didn't work for me.
3,"Good when it's working, but troublesome","We tried to use this device to alert the folks at our community's gatehouse that vehicles were approaching. It worked (mostly) for about six months to a year, but in our application it became too high maintenance.Factors that may have adversely affected its performance in our application:- Remote sensor was outdoors- Remote sensor was subject to extremes of heat- Remote sensor was exposed to sprinklersWe finally gave up on this. But it might work well in a less climatically demanding environment."
3,"Useful, but dont rely on it","When it works, it is very useful. It sometimes doesn't pickup passing vehicles. Also, for a device sitting out in the elements, the case didn't have a weather gasket to protect against water intrusion. I guess for the money it is a decent product. Long term reliability is questionable."
1,"The Reporter"" Wireless Alert System","It works fine till it rains. Goes off repeatedly in the rain. If you set the sens lower it won't work at all. Had the unit replaced by the factory, but the new unit works the same. Just plain junk!!"
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT,"I paid nearly a hundred $ for this product for the end of my driveway to alert me when someone pulled in , but the buzzer was not very loud and there is no volume control on it and it only detects up too 30 feet so i can t cover my hole driveway and you have to cross the beam it does not work well if you move directly toward to it it tracks crossway better"
1,Not a happy camper,"I received the Chamberlain reporter RWA300R on Nov. 12th. After reading the instructions front to back I installed the sending unit 110' from the base station, this being the best position for my application. The signal had to travel through a garage door and 2X6 wall construction. Now, You have to be within 2 feet of the sending unit to activate it which it is advertised at 30' and a set up of 10'-20'. After much trial and error I have come to the conclusion that this particular unit is ""JUNK"". I have since moved the sending unit to the edge of the garage door where I am about 32' from the base station. After two days of frustration I think I will be sending this unit back!!! Thanks but no thanks"
1,Trash!,I bought this at Radio Shack (always a mistake.)Device is incredibly flimsy. The alarm can't be heard 20 feet away. It detects motion all right and keeps it a secret. This product would be a bad deal if it were free.Poorly-made trash. Taking it back to the store tomorrow. More quality went into the cardboard box than into the motion detector.
5,A concise report on the effects of amino acids,"Just happened to find this title in the library. Since reading it, both my wife and I have started taking NAC-Glutathione with excellent results.A very good explanation of why your body needs vitamins and amino acids to combat free radicals.A life altering revelation."
4,There's something sexy about being on vacation.,"And this book captures that essence. As with most books combining different stories, not every one did it for me, but most of them did. My favorite was about two men who sit next to each other on a plane and have to whisper to each other and be very discreet."
3,Started to break after only a couple days,"This playhouse was fairly easy to assemble (though it was missing an important screw) and I like the overall design.However, the shelf on the front of the playhouse became detached on one end (unrelated to the missing screw) after only a couple days of assembling it and the kids weren't putting any unusual pressure on it."
3,Could be better for the price,"I bought this for my girls, ages 8 and 4, for Christmas. When I put it together, the screw for the clock hands was so loose, they could not set the time. It kept hanging down no matter what we tried. Also, my oldest tried to go through the side opening and the fabric tore. It also takes up a TON of space. I don't think I would buy another one."
3,fun but gets hard,The first half of the game is fun but then it gets difficult. the multiplayer is funner then the single player storyline
3,Can't use it...,"UNFORTUNATELY THE GAME DOES NOT WORK WITH XBOX 360. WE ARE WAITING FOR A RETURN SLIP FROM SELLER, product is in fine condition but only usable on older Xbox."
3,Fun!,Extremely fun game to play! the only thing is that if you havent bought it already..dont..just buy Red Dead Redemption..unless you dont have a ps3 and only have a ps2...then i def. recommend buying Red Dead Revolver..the storyline is good..the game play is even better...its a must buy for GTA lovers
2,wee,"Another short game made insanely monotonous and thoroughly boring due to limited ability to save games. Actual new play is pretty limited, but you will play the same scenes over and over and over again because you are set so far back each time you die. For the more dimwitted player, this will make the game seem longer than it is. Add to that some of the most unrealistic enemies in a western genre (like the half naked fat guy that runs right up to you to blow you and him up with dynamite) and you have a pretty pointless waste of time. If you have no need for originality or creativity, buy this game now."
3,If only....,I bought this game with the intention of getting to know the storyline before Red Dead Redemption. I wish that I had further reviewed this game and how it plays on the 360. I was sorely dissapointed to find out after it continually locked up on me that it has compatibility issues with the 360. I was able to play the first 11 chapters and that was it. Locks up every time after that and makes the game unplayable. I love the way this game plays and I enjoy the storyline. I do understand failure on my part to do better research about this game working with the 360 shouldn't necessarily have anything to do with overall score but I believe that it does due to the fact that so many other major titles update when you log onto Xbox live and patch the issues. This game does not have that support and considering it is from a major developer in Rockstar it should. Aside from that the chapters I was able to play were fun and I would recommend this game to anyone who has an older Xbox.
1,Are you kidding me?,This game is ignorant. On the other hand Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games that ever hit the market. The movement of your character in Red Dead Redemption is like gears of war. Red Dead Revolver stinks.
1,Good game-poor disc quality,"This review is not based the game itself But the disc. Got about a few missions in and the game freezes every time on the same level. Definitely not amazons fault, just disappointed in the seller. Word of advice, be careful buying used games from places like goodwill."
5,Quick Arrival!,"This arrived in less than a week, and I am so excited to play it. The disk had very mild (barely there) signs of previous use, So I am sure it will play just fine. When I lived in ohio, I had visited their local locations for games/videos and was extremely satified. :)"
3,Good Attempt,"I will keep this short and sweet. I think this game was great, the character build up, the weapons, the voices and the detail of the environments. I did leave out the missions because even though they were fun it just seemed like your were forced to stay within a certain path which isn't something I would tend to enjoy. I did not like the fact that there was little to no exploration option and it appeared after everytime you completed a mission it pulled you into another portion of the game. So basically even though this game was a great 1st attempt to the incredible sequel red dead redemption it had the working to lead into what now is the utmost enjoyable long lasting game ever made from a western theme it did fall short of 5/5 stars for me. Now if you are into this red dead series look at my review for red dead redemption."
5,I LIKED IT,"Let me start by saying that this game is, in my opinion, a rental-type of game. This isn't some game you want to go buy. Beating it will only take a few days and Blockbuster lets you rent it for a week. It's a story about Red, a bounty hunter who tracks down outlaws. Great soundtrack, decent graphics, and a very satisfying storymode. I recommend renting this game to anyone who likes westerns or is a fan of western history. Not worth the buying price, but very fun to rent and play for a week."
1,The Worst Game Ever,"I was excited when I got this game and couldnt wait to play it. It was a real disappointment to me.There are no fouls and the graphics are auful.The other team always wins no matter what you are.The computer throws you around and Its almost impossible to stop the computer on defense.The create a player feature is pointless.If you were a real sports fan,I dont think youd want people with monster heads. You can trade players or do anything with the rosters, and worst of all,Only two people are allowed out on the floor...."
2,weak,"the only reason i gave these game two stars is beacause of the tight dunks. if ur looking fir a game with cool crazy off the wall dunks then by all means buy this game. but it ur looking for a game thats good buy something else. this game does not even have a three point shootout! to the creators of this game, i would have givin this game a ten if only u have put in a slam dunk contest! it would have been PERFECT!"
2,Too Slow,"Honore should stick to Journalism. This book is a shallow treatment of the topic. Reads like a series of magazine articles that gloss over the topic but provide little detailed information or insight. Try Tom Hodgkinson's ""Freedom Manifesto"" instead."
3,A lot of repetition,"The book starts out with a great example of the author's revelation that he's moving too fast in life. I'm only 3/4 of the way through the book but what I'm finding is example upon example of people who have found ways to slow down in life...Who discovered Yoga, what companies have shifted their work flow philosophies, what countries have re-examined their work ethic. It's a laundry list of examples supporting the author's premise that we're going too fast in life. I would have preferred less examples and more in depth examination of the philosphies of slowing down."
3,I really wanted to like this,"This book started out strong, but then as the chapters on specific aspects of slowness progressed, I couldn't help but think that the author was devoid of any real ideas on the subject and was just using cheap anecdotes about modern fads. I really did want to like this book. The concept is great, the execution is lazy. Maybe the author should have slowed down and taken the time to think more deeply on his subject. I suppose my search goes on for a meaningful book about this topic."
5,Slow is the New Fast,"Looking to take the exit ramp off the fast highway of life today?What happens when we wake up and realize life is too fast-paced? Or we can't enjoy the truly important things we may already have or can have? We step out of our hypnotic state and learn other ways to cope, knowing we can realize a higher quality of life. Meditation, spending time outdoors, reading, practicing our art, investing energy in others, and simplifying our lifestyles are examples. Reducing stress can improve health. Stop and smell the roses. You won't regret it.This book is an easy, leisurely, enjoyable read. The back cover sums it up: ""Slow is the New Fast."""
5,Slow is the way to go!,"Arianna Huffington promoted 'In Praise of Slowness' on her web site [...]. The book is an affirmation of a philosophy that I have been approaching from several angles: Don't sweat the small stuff, Less is more, Buddhism and so on. Our society is insanely trying to out-achieve itself in an upward spiral that has caused many a crash. The book helps me to understand the art of a deep-thinking, meditative life, keeping me from sharing that fate.Experimenting with the concepts in the book led to immediate insight, and a peace of mind that enabled me to carefully, calmly, study a problem. Due to the deep thought I used to analyze the problem I came to a fix that kept the project from failing! Jaws dropped, and it didn't even seem all that special to me.I think you will find this book to be a gateway to a new way of living. I would highly recommend it to those executives who create tight schedules that require people to rush. There is a better way!"
4,Great concepts....applicable and inspiring message.,"Happened upon this guy's website thanks to a quote from this book off of a blog I frequent. Couldn't help but to buy this book out of curiosity. I am a multi-tasker, time-management freak, so I needed something to help me remember to slow down and take it easy. Great research/statistics in this book draw you in at the get-go. Applicable hints and tips on how to achieve a slower, more enjoyable, lifestyle keep you hooked till the end. The only thing I was weird about was the meditation/new age philosophies, but I looked past that for the parts I did agree with. Bravo."
3,Get off the Treadmill,"As one who has taken steps to avoid the now ubiquitous hurrying through modern life -- which has gone from hectic to frantic in recent years -- I picked up this book with interest. My main focus was to read about ways to change the workworld and to decrease stress,which I found inadequately covered. I was looking for a more in-depth treatment of the ""work to live, not live to work"" philosophy than I saw presented here.The chapters on sex, leisure and slowing down family life were also of interest. Of less interest were the chapters about food, the medical profession, and cities."
5,Learning To Live Life: Similar To The Living Life Game,"This book does a tremendous job of letting us know that we need to slow down and truly live life.It is very similar to an inspirational gift/game that I love that I bought on Uncommongoods.com called Living Life (www.LivingLifeGame.com), which guides us through thirty heart warming activities like contacting old friends, watching the sunrise and buying a toy for a child. These activities slow us down and show us how to cherish those things in life that matter, but that we often over look in our hectic lives. Both the book and the Living Life game help us to slow down and live our lives to the fullest as we only have one beautiful life to live. I have bought this book and the Living Life Game for friends who have love it and they have bought it for many others. They are both worth the money and make others lives more beautiful!"
2,Waste of time,"The book reads like a series of very shallow popular magazine articles. I felt like I was wasting my time, and just skimmed most of it after the first few chapeters."
2,In Praise of Slowness:Challenging theCult of Speed,"Living in Sweden, this book was given the highest standard of praise in my local newspaper. However, it was not what I had expected when I began to read it in English (my native language). Perhaps the translated version into Swedish was better than the original version. It was o.k., but not as good as the Swedish critic gave it honors for."
4,more battery life please,"This impact driver does everything my 12v Makita did at a fraction of the cost. It feels nice and substantial, not cheap by anymeans. you would think for the money that it would. My only gripe is the battery life. It is aweful!! The 2.6ah NiMh in the Makita would run forever, this one goes limp embarassingly fast on the jobsite. 2.0ah NiCd is sad. Other than that it is highly recommended. Nothing at Home Depot can touch this in the $129 range."
5,Four years and still going strong,"Like the title says, I've been abusing these little gems for over four years and the tool and batteries are still strong. There have been some advancements in battery technology lately, but these NiCD impact drivers offer a whole lot of bang for the buck. The variable trigger is responsive enough to allow for driving everything from small fasteners to large lag bolts. I've even used it to change the tires on my wife's car. With the current price being offered from Amazon through CPO Bosch, I can't imagine a better buy! I'm considering ordering a third one, as I can't get replacement batteries for the low cost this kit is being offered for."
3,Be Warned!,"This is not the band Tiara that is responsible for the brilliant record, Titletron. This Tiara is a Japanese female dance-pop singer. I guess it's OK for what it is, but not my cup of tea. Allmusic even erroneously listed this EP in the band Tiara's discography."
1,Chelby,Too much history and extra information. I was looking for basic information to understand numerology. This wasn't it. Greatly disappointed.
1,blitz-not worth it!,"When I bought the original NFL Blitz for my 64 I liked it, except the cheating computer AI(which made me have fumbles even when no one was around me) and the the way you point to a reciever. When I bought Blitz 2000 and very disappointed that they didn't fix the problems from the original game. If you want Blitz 2000, get a Dreamcast."
3,Too much violence for Dad?,"They say this game is for 5 - 20 year olds, but most dads have lost count after 20. This game will knock your socks off just as the late body slams demobilize the offensive players. No doubt about it-the graphics are imaginative and the burley, grid-iron figures bring the game to life. The post play commentary is amusing, but as one comment goes following a late body slam, ""was that really necessary?""-my fatherly response is a resounding ""NO"", which is why I gave the game a 3 as opposed to a 4 or 5. Have fun with your dads playing NFL blitz, kids, but remember that such dirty post play in real life will get your faced buried in the mud, kicked out of the game, suspended for life, or all three."
1,this does NOT teach sportsmanship!,"If you want your kids to learn sportsmanship, this is NOT the game for them. The game allows 'body slams' after the play is completed. Watching my kids play, I thought they were playing a WWF game. Do not waste your money!"
2,Not that good,"This is not the best football game. If you like ""no-rules"" kind of football (after each play, turns into a five-second wrestling match) you'd like it, but still it has set backs. It is not an easy game. Every time you get a good pass and you run ahead of everyone, a second later, someone's on you, even if you have the fastest team."
2,Very Repetitive,"I have to admit, this game is very fun to play with a friend, but soon gets boring. The gameplay lacks depth, and the taunts, although entertaining at first, soon become repetitive and lose their touch. I have played the first Blitz and there is almost no difference except for a new box. I recommend renting this game only, not buying."
3,Think About It...,"Blitz 2000 is the same , hard hitting football game as the origional, without much of a change. Blitz 2000 offers an excellent level of fun, and manages to throw in good sound and graphics. A good party game with the new 4 player mode, but still has many setbacks. If you own the origional,don't bother with Blitz 2K, but if you don't, consider buying it, but rent it first."
2,"Not that bad... but not that good, either!","Blitz is just one of those games that you get bored of easily. Sure it's good for the first couple of weeks, but it's just the same challenge over and over again. It's better with more actual people with you, now with it's four player compatibility. The trivia adds a fun twist at the end, only when playing with other people. Lucky it didn't get a one star rating; this is just the same thing as the regular Blitz. But if you've never played or owned a Blitz game before, you may want to rent this. It will seem like the best game to you. Sure it's not that bad... but not that good either!"
1,Nothing New,NFL Blitz 2000 Is nothing we haven't seen before. The only real difference between it and NFL Blitz is that four players can play. Personally with four players on a space limited screen may get confusing. All my resources tell me that the game was nothing but a big disappointment.
2,The Only Difference is that the title says Two Thousand,"This game is luckey it got past a 1. its the same darn thing! the only reason this game got a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the gameplay, which is a good plus from the 1st blitz. if you have the 1st blitz, dont get this one, it is the same thing! However, if you dont have any blitz and havent played the 1st one alot, this is a good start."
1,Received wrong blitz,"Ordered nfl blitz 2000 for my n64, nd i got nfl blitz...... way off! 0 stars never buying from u again"
4,the good game,There is huge hits.Great durability and lots of fun.I highly recommend this game to all people.I like it a lot.It's my favorite game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,great watch,"Bought this watch for my mom for Christmas, she loved it , and she's very hard to buy for, she had to have the band adjusted whuch is pretty common. Would recomend this and any other watches through Amazon."
5,Great watch!,"I have worn this watch daily for almost 8 years. The battery life is getting pretty short, but otherwise, it has held up wonderfully."
1,Extremely dated product,"This was Tamiya's very first German infantry set and was sculpted around 1970. The state of the art for sculpting, detailing and molding miniature plastic figure kits has advanced very far in the last 30+ years. The only reason to buy this item is if you are a collector of plastic models."
4,"Enter Laughing, and exit Laughing even more. . .","If laughter is the Best Medicine, this book has to be a major medical breakthough. . .It's a laugh a minute with stories we can all relate to. Lauren and Lisa show us how to attack a problem by finding a way around it and poking fun at it all the way. This is a must read for those who take life TOO seriously and need a less on lightening up! Encore!!"
2,"True Witness: Cops, Courts, Science, and the Battle against Misidentification",Too much time spent on background of the players and their attempts to legitimize their theories. Were they just trying to make the book impressive by making it longer? I think there is enough current information out there to provide a much more interesting and informative read.
5,Starting Dressage? This one is for you!,I bought this book as a beginner dressage rider. It is an excellent guide and contains a history of Dressage. The book is very easy to read and relate to. I use it as a reference tool and learning before and after each lesson.
3,"Questionable service, good book.","The dust cover was ripped because it shifted within the bubble wrap during shipping. The book was listed as ""new"" but had a black felt-pen streak across the pages at the base of the spine - which, I believe, is the mark of a production second."
3,A little too basic,"I'm not an advanced rider, by any stretch of the imagination. I consider myself an advanced beginner - training level.I found about half of this book to be too basic for me.It is well written, clear and concise. Good as a reference. Nicely put together book.It would be a great gift for someone recently starting into dressage."
1,Comprehensive? You've GOT to be kidding!,"The standard textbook for college music theory has, for decades, been Walter Piston's ""Harmony"". But, college music theory is normally a two year course, and the book is written that way and is very thorough.This book, is marketed as ""A Comprehensive Outline in Easy-To-Use Narrative Format"" and ""Supplements Major Textbooks"". Nothing could be further from the truth!Yes, it is an easy read, but you go through half the book before even reaching a starting point for college theory. The content doesn't cover more than a third of the material covered in a college music theory text, so a comprehensive outline it is not. I also found glaring differences in termonology.If you are looking to LEARN music thoery, then stick with the original Piston. If you are looking to review, I highly recommend ""Graduate Review of Tonal Theory"" by Steven Laitz and Christopher Bartlette.As for THIS book, at least for theory, don't waste your money."
4,Nice abridgment,"This is a practical book that summarizes the most important aspects in the Music Theory, Harmony and an introduction to the Musical Analysis. The book is well structured and the explanations are clear and intelligible, for wich it is well adapted for beginners, teachers at college level, and also for those that, not being professional musicians, but they studied this matter years ago, they are looking for an a single-book-abridgment to refresh their knowledge quickly. It only lacks, from my point of view, of an appendix with the answers to the proposed exercises, what would help the self-students a lot."
4,Asombroso,"Vargas Llosa se adentra una vez m√°s en la compleja sociedad peruana donde los blancos, los""cholos"" y los ind√≠genas viven en realidades distintas que se cruzan en circunstancias cotidianas y que el autor sabe desentra√±ar y narrar con gran dominio en sus respectivas expresiones. Un compa√±ero de la universidad y sus encuentros y desencuentros con el narrador principal, se tejen en torno a la fascinaci√≥n de aquel por una cultura amaz√≥nica que es eterna caminante (Los Machiguengas); como contrapartida hay otro narrador transhumante de esa cultura, que cuenta historias m√≠ticas a lo largo de los r√≠os de la Amazon√≠a peruana. Al final las narraciones se unen, mostrando las intrincadas y asombrosas relaciones de las sociedades suramericanas."
5,Great Chicago blues by two of the best on slide guitars.,"This cd is one of my favorites with these two musicians. Playing great blues, and with real feelings. Having heard many small blues bands, these are the guys I will follow anytime I can get to where they are playing. We need more from them on cd's."
4,good enough,"I have read some of the reviews for this product and some say it is cheap and breaks easily, perhaps. I found this reel to be very smooth and well balanced. I did notice that the bail takes a little more effort to trip than some of my other reels but considering the price I am very satisfied. If you want a $500 dollar reel by all means buy one but it will not be 14 times better than this one. Fish on!"
1,Disappointing,This CD is not worth the price. The lyrics are hard to understand and there is not enough repetition of the multiplication facts.
5,My kids love these CD's!!!,"My kids absolutely love the Teacher and the Rockbots CD's (we have them all). They listen to them on repeat almost every night and my 8-year-old son can now tell you all sorts of facts about American History that are included on the CD. Best of all, the adults in our family enjoy listening as well. The lyrics are available on the Teacher and the Rockbots website so your kids can sing along even more easily (along with other extras like lesson plans, etc). My kids' favorite on this CD is ""Revolution, Revolution"" - they sing it ALL the time!"
4,This Is Not A Review,"How do you review something when you're not quite sure what it is to begin with?This Is Not A Novel is, in fact, not a novel but what it is is not entirely clear. Throughout his work, Markson runs through details about how famous literary figures have died, what philosophers believed and what artists said. There are no characters except, perhaps, for the elusive ""Writer"". There is no plot. Nothing thrilling happens. And yet its amazing to me how drawn in to the book I was.Bottom line: I don't know what it was but I'm glad I read it. Experimental fiction can either be disastrous (see The Castle of Crossed Destinies by Italo Calvino) or monumentally successful (see 253: The Print Remix by Geoff Ryman) - there's usually no middle ground. This Is Not A Novel definitely fits into the latter category."
3,A compulsive read which is neither a novel nor a poem,"It was odd to read this, because of timing. I had just read Mark Salzman's _Lost In Place_, a memoir of his quixotic youth which addresses the human need to make a mark in the face of mortality and frailty, and the ultimate futility of that need. Then I pick up this. Same theme, just as overtly stated.However, though this book is entertaining, erudite, and thought-provoking, it doesn't do the job nearly as well as Salzman's hilarious story. The conceit is ultimately pretentious, and its melancholy narrator isn't very interesting."
2,Great Title,"This is not a novel? Damn straight it isn't. I'm usually the first person to applaud experimental fiction, but Markson's book reads like the literary journal of a manic depressive. Not exactly groundbreaking, just pretentious. For those of you not already aware, the book is simply a collection of seemingly disordered facts about famous writers, historians, and philosophers. It turns out that the sentences are not completely disordered, because they tend to follow a very subtle arc that echoes the pattern of life. However, aside from offering the occasional interesting fact, this book has no appeal. It is the first book I couldn't finish in six years."
2,Half facinating literary facts; half phony self-inflation,"This is a maddening book. Roughly half consists of facts (I assume - no citations) concerning writers and other creative artists, some of them wonderful. Another quarter states, usually without comment, the causes of death for such artists. And the final quarter consists of spare comments (often just a sentence fragment)on themes of life and death, meant to invoke pity and awe but instead remindful of ""Deep Thoughts"" written somewhat in the manner of the Cantos, phony and inflated. Imagine something like: ""Sophocles. Dante. Heine. Djuna Barnes. Writer."" (referring to himself)."
4,Lost Foreign Film Gem from Argentina,"Long lost gem from Argentina. Features some famous South American and European actors. Shows how effects of divorce on teenagers are shared similarly throughout the world, regardless of culture background. The breakup of a family can cause problems with teens that sometimes don't come to light immediately. In this film a teenage girl must deal with her overbearing father while she has immersed herself in a lurid love affair. Her father is in the midst of a midlife crisis, unable to acknowledge his daughter's sexual awareness at the same time as he is dealing with his own martial issues. Which may be the cause of his daughters erratic behavior.Set in Argentina in the early 80's. The film was released on vhs in the us only in its original Spanish language and not subtitledRated R ( nudity - sexual material ) COLOR 93mins -"
5,Is there such a thing as too much fun ?,"Cooking and baking is one of my passions and so it goes that watching cooking shows on TV instead of movies is the norm in my TV room. Jacques became one of my favorite chefs the moment I began watching his show during FoodTV's Chocolate week in February. I found myself watching with child-like delight as I watched him pour chocolate on the counter and into molds, making chocolate making look like child's play so I knew I had to order his books.Desert Circus at Home is my favorite baking book. The recipies are fun and easy, ranging from simple basics to fairly complex.Buy this book and I'll bet you'll have all the pages covered with chocolate finger prints in no time at all because you will want to make all the recipies as soon as you open the pages. The recipies are foolproof if you have any experience in the kitchen at all."
5,Delicious and whimsical desserts anyone can cook.,"Despite the proliferation of photos of a professionally coiffed jacques Torres, this is not another ego book by a professional chef. This book is filled with wonderful recipes specifically selected because they are well-suited to the home cook. They range from fairly complex but doable creations to simple tips on how to improve common desserts. The instructions are easy to follow, and Torres is an entertaining and helpful author. Many of the recipes are designed to appeal to children, a real plus for parents who cook."
3,Great for proms,Shoes arrived promptly and as shown. The jewels/rhinestones had a plastic feel...but looked very nice and dressy with the prom dress.
3,Really slow device,The DNS-323 is a nice device but overall it is extremely slow. Formating the device is easy but it will wipe any data that you might already have on your drive. The drives will NOT support NTFS or anything else. D-Link decided to use a proprietary file system. Copying 1TB of data will take you over two days to complete over 1GB Ethernet.Some things to be aware of. The iTunes server streams music well enough to computers. It will not stream anything to an Apple TV. No music or video. The USB port in the back of the device is for a printer and compatible UPS device only. You can't plug anything else into this port.Overall I think this is a device that needs a refresh. It needs to have a faster copy time and a USB port that does more.
4,Excellent LAN file server,"I wanted a simple way to share files across the LAN at my home, this NAS definitely fills that bill. Setup could not be any simpler, the least computer savvy person could manage it. Plug the hard drives in, plug the cables in, run the included CD software to initialize the NAS. Once setup is complete, map the drive to your system using the NAS ""easysearch"" tool. Setup is complete. Once a computer is mapped to the NAS, they have access to everything on the NAS. The print server within the NAS works perfectly. The NAS is extremely quiet, though there should be a thin rubber pad for the drives to rest on internally.Again, I just wanted a simple, RAID 1, central file server. I am using this to store all of my music, downloaded software, and system backup images. I am definitely pleased with my purchase."
4,"Great hardware, have to work with the software","There are some great reviews about this product already posted on this website so mine will simply echo them. The hardware is good (processor is a bit slow so it struggles when you are downloading torrents and mediatomb is indexing at the same time), its relatively quiet (I am sure it will be even better once I figure out how to shut the fan off) and drive installation is a breeze. Where it suffers, which seems to be the case in every one of these linux devices, is the stock firmware just doesn't do what you want it to.I bought this unit because of the development going on around it and it does not disappoint. Its relatively painless to upgrade the abilities of the unit, a few hours at most and you will be up and running with a stable upnp/DLNA client, ftp server, bit torrent client and more. However, you should be prepared to do a little text based editing."
5,Great NAS,I looked at all kinds of NAS equipment but chose this one due to price and feature set. Very easy to set up and very reliable. Would highly recommend.
1,Customer non-support,"Looked like the perfect NAS solution, and the instructions were simple - until I tried to install t. The software did not recognize my drives, at all.Tried to call D-Link support, but hours on-hold is not practical. Three emails to tech support went unanswered.I will never buy a D-Link product again."
5,DNS 323 Setup & Operation was flawless,"I have purchased several of enclosures and use the linksys NSLU2. I can say confidently this was by far the easiest of the external boxes to bring online. Through large file transfers, its looks to be 2x (or more) faster than my current NSLU2's. Not a scientific study, just an observation. Also much less time to configure. And having Raid 1 configuration is a bonus. It took a total of 20 minutes from opening to box to being online. Bulk of the time was in the formating and just deciding to go with Raid 1.At this point, I can highly recommend this as a network attached storage option. Also I would recommend this for the average home user since the setup was not highly technical. Though I did bypass the CD and went straight to the IP assigned, I still say this is a very easy unit to setup overall."
4,Nice little unit,"We use this to store all of our family documents, photos, and other important files we want to save or share. Paired it with 2 Western Digital Green drives and it runs quietly and we have not had any problems. The only thing that would be nicer is if the startup time was a little faster when it's been idle for awhile. Other than that, the web interface for configuration and administration is good enough for home use."
3,DNS-323 Review,"The product worked out of the box as expected. The drives easily fit in the slots. I used the web browser to find the unit and the programming is fairly intuitive. I would have loved the unit except the gigabit ethernet does not perform well in my opinion. I backed up my PC using this device as the storage device and it took 11 hours to do what a USB external drive did in 4 hours. If performance is not an issue for you, it appears to be a good unit. Performance was very important to me."
1,Data loss... Non-english filenames problem,"First impression was very good. Nice looking unit. Quiet. Small footprint. Easy setup (if it worked..).I was going to use this nas to store my media library. I have a large library and quite a few files are in russian, polish, hungarian, german.. you know - all those strange looking characters. Guess what? SOME of them do not transfer correctly - filenames got truncated after a character the 323 didn't like. Upgraded to the newest firmware (out today Dec 18) - it changed things but didn't fix. OTHER files started to give me problems. For example - it removes the capital Ja (in russian) but regular ja goes through ok. Luckily for me Amazon pays return postage - it goes back to Amazon tomorrow."
3,D-Link DNS-323 Network Storage,"D-Link DNS-323 2-Bay Network Storage EnclosureWhenever my computer would reboot after a Microsoft Windows Update this drive would disappear from ""My Computer"" and/or ""My Network Places"". Easy search Utility could not 'find' this drive. Forget D-Link Tech Support. Their first suggestion was that I call tech support. While describing problem I was either disconnected or hung up on. Six email replies later I got a single typical question: ""Does your computer reboot after an update?"" My reply : ""Yes (and name of tech support rep). My computer reboots"". I further added:""(Name of tech support rep), after several days and many hours I have come up with what D-Link has been totally unable to come up with on a step by step proceedure for getting my disappearing DNS back on line. I will share this with your entire D-Link staff. The step by step process is in the attachment ""DNS-323_Recover Disappearing.rtf""""Do I get a job at D-Link tech support?"""
3,Crazy to Spend Money on This,"Sure, this is a simple solution, but for the same money you could buy an Intel-Atom-D525 (dual core) mini-ITX motherboard with a gigabit LAN NIC, 4GB of RAM and a case with a power supply that is FAST FAST FAST ! ----- WinCrazy"
1,Don't waste your time,"Let's just say you get what you pay for. This product has perhaps the worst user interface I've ever seen. I did manage to get it connected to my network, but found it unusable from that point. I returned mine."
1,unreliable when it counts - avoid,"If you want to use this to store important data, I'd advise looking elsewhere. While most of the time it works fine, it's just not reliable.1) Every so often it hangs and becomes unresponsive, usually but not always in the middle of copying large amounts of data on or off it, and needs a reset to recover.2) I configured it to use RAID-1 so all the data should be mirrored across both drives. Everything's great until it informs me that one of the drives has failed. I replaced that drive, at which point it said it would take 173000 minutes (that's 120 days!) to re-establish the array, hung, and has never let me access any of the data on the surviving drive since, even after removing the new drive. Had to pull the remaining disk and mount it in a linux server to recover the data. This kind of thing is frankly unforgivable in a device that's supposed to be safely storing your data.In case you're wondering, this is with the latest firmware."
1,"reasonably fast, hackable, but noisy, bugged","Good:- fast (for a NAS)- hackable, can run torrent, media server etc.- clever case, easy to add a diskBad:- Noisy - hard disk noise resonates in the case- Will get very hot w/ 2 harddisks- When I added a second harddisk, it said it would format the new one - it stated the model number so I am 100% sure of this - , and then proceeded to format the old one. D-Link support said ""it seems you lost your data"". Thanks!"
4,So far so good,"Well, so far so good. This unit replaced a Cisco/Linksys device that went bad. The difference in the speed is very noticeable and this unit looks more robust. The only improvement I would ask for has to do with how it handles users and the assignment of shares. The Cisco/Linksys device was the same.This unit is definitely worth the price difference."
1,Steer clear.,"Steer clear of this product. I purchased in December 2007 after careful consideration of options and features. Very long story short is as follows:1) Customer support stinks.2) Device does not stay connected to LAN.3) MS-Backup utility is prevented from setting archive bit (even after updating the unit) hence you cannot do incremental backups.This was the biggest waste of money, and even more precious, time!Steer clear. I stopped using this piece of junk! It cost me $180 for the unit and $85 for the drive for a grand total loss of $265. Thanks for nothing D-Link."
2,Worse NAS Ever,"I read a bunch of good reviews and thought it was a good NAS, but let me tell you than if you care about the UPnP Av server you can choose another one.For some reason with me the iTunes server and the UPnP AV server are stuck at 3% of file scanning! Worse, if I do a refresh for the iTunes server it froze the whole NAS, because the process take 100% of CPU, and you cannot even turn the NAS off because it's busy... I never see that in any-kind of device. The power button is actually manage by software, so if your NAS is busy doing something, you cannot turn it down.Oh and I Had only 200Gb of media. Because of the turn off issue i had to unplugged it which cause one of my hard drive in RAID 1 to crash, it took 4hours to sync 200Gb from the other hard drive.The Bittorent client, is the worse implementation of a Bittorent Client. Seriously Don't buy that you will save some money.I give it two Stars because it's really simple of use when you just need a backup storage."
3,D-Link 2-Bay NAS with FARSONE back up software,"Installed the device with 2 1.5TB drives no problem, but the POWER on/off button was very hard to depress. I took the cover off, it was easier to power on that way.After installing the software I got an error msg upon reboot prior to windows starting, NODE 3 LINE 73. I had to reset the machine in order to get it to come up. When windows finally came up the software immediately started the un-install process.I called D-Link support, they were useless. I spent a week answering repeated questions and or they dummied up about my past communications. This is frustrating when you can not get an ENGLISH speaking tech person on the phone. I gave up...Called FARSTONE support, I was given some suggestions and it is still not working (SFOTWARE). I should not have to go out a purcahse backup software for a device that came with it. I will give FARSTONE a few more days...Thinkg if doing a RMA."
3,Good quality but slow,"Functions well, easy to set up, good quality build. However, it is slow. I haven't clocked transfer speeds, but we run a database off it, and our database slowed noticeably. Everyone complained that it was much slower than when we served our database off one person's computer over a plain old XP p2p network.So, I took the HD out of the DNS 323, popped it into my mom's old XP computer, reformatted it, and used that to serve files. What a difference, database is snappy again, and files seem to transfer faster.So, if you need a good quality NAS and speed is not an issue, the DNS 323 works great. Otherwise, it's much slower than a dedicated XP box doing the same function over Windows networking."
4,Good unit and reliable so far,"I have been using the DNS-323 for about one month and so far there have not been any problems with the unit. It is quite fast for file storage and recovery, and for playing back media files. However, it is less than spectacular for other file operations, such as combining RAR files, updating records, etc."
5,"Serves Up HD-DVDs Just Fine, 120-240v","Very satisfied. Smaller than expected. Fast enough to play HD-DVDs wirelessly (D-Link DIR-655 router) to my notebook (Dell Inspiron E1505, 802.11BGN, 945GM, Core Duo (2) 2GHz, Vista Premium, Arcsoft Digital Theater, D-Link DNS-323 NAS). 120 to 240 volts.Don't forget to upgrade firmware."
3,WARNING: Product Compatibility Flaws,"Please be aware that this product is not compatible with every 3.5"" SATA drive. In particular, it doesn't play well with Western Digital products. I purchased a 2TB WD hard drive only to find out after some searching on dlink forums that the particular model is unsupported. The problem I had was that my computer would not map the network drive with either the included software or manually.Here is a link to all supported hard drive disks on the dlink website. Please check this out before purchasing the DNS-323: [...]"
4,"Great NAS, but Vista user watch out....","Purchased this NAS about 3 weeks ago and it works exactly as advertised with two terabyte drives. Bit torrent software in the current build is particularly useful. Unit is whisper quite, but has big blue lights that I wish you could dim. Biggest issue may not be Dlink's fault, but Windows Vista's. My primary computer is a Vista laptop which does not want to log on to the mapped drives from sleep or remember passwords. My XP machines work like a dream in this respect. Units other limitation, so I've heard, it won't turn on automatically after a power outage. In all it was just what I needed."
4,"D-Link DNS-323 Easy to use, reliable, but kinda slow","I installed the D-Link DNS-323 NAS a week ago and have moved about 200GB of data onto it by now. It has been completely reliable. It was easy to install and setup. The Group/User setup is not very flexible because a user can only be part of one group, I think. But setting up shares and defining the network security setup is great and works fine. The printer server works with no setup at all, very convenient. Copying data onto the NAS is kinda slow compared to copying from PC to PC on a gigabit LAN but all-in-all it does what it is advertised to do very well. The memeo auto backup software works very well too. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and think the product is a great deal for the money."
5,Great Product.,"I don't have any second thought about this product. What It offers, it delivers without any glitch..."
2,Make sure you consult the list of supported SATA drives!,"""You are NOT required to use these drives for successful operation. Most other SATA drives will also be compatible."" BS. It doesn't support Seagate ST3400633AS (Barracuda 7200.9) with FW 1.01."
2,too slow,"I bought the DNS 232 for my media center, but unfortunately the communication is too slow, if you are lucky the max speed is 12-15MB, furthermore to stream from more than one device is almost impossible, and to stream VOBs, doesn't work, is frozen all the time. if you want to set as a RAID that will be other problem, the compatibility with the HDD, I tried with four different, and finally it worked, you have to use the HDD recommended by the manufacture, if not you are wasting your money."
4,D-Link 2-bay NAS,"Very nice little unit. Easy to setup. Easy to install. Unit works well, as well as the uPNP streaming to Xbox 360 (which works out of the box with the standard setup). I was a bit worried about the Xbox streaming as I had read about difficulties in the internet, but nothing to worry about for my setup, which was a basic home wired network. The only thing I didn't like was the blue LED which is bright, and NEVER turns off, even when the drives power down.One more thing, this unit is SMALLER than it looks in the pics. I think they would sell a lot more if they put a coffee mug next to the advertising picture to give a sense of scale. Very nice design and solid construction."
4,Dlink DNS323,Hard Drive works great. Print server works great on printer but does not support scanner on all in one units
2,Excellent - Until it died for no apparent reason.,"For a whole year, this device was pretty fantastic. I used FunPlug to run interesting software on it; had 2 1TB harddrives inside of it for media storage, which I would stream to multiple devices in my home.However, just 10 days after the 1-year warranty expired - the device stopped working without warning. It manages to stay connected to the network for about 1 minute before disconnecting and becoming unreachable by any means. It seems that for some reason, the network interface on the device simply ceases to work.Overall, it was a nice device despite its quirks and bugs (though I would certainly not recommend it to a novice user), but I am very disappointed in the hardware quality."
2,Slow,"this is touted as ""blazing fast... gigabit"" unit, however there is a major bottleneck and that is not the network adapter.When used in RAID 1 setup with 2 5400 RPM drives, it performs little faster then 100 base T (22 Mbps to be exact).The bottleneck appears to be it's cpu performing RAID duties.more detailed description of my case here:I initially thought my router was the problem and replaced that, to find out that it is the NAS."
2,Great unit - but it doesn't work,"I ordered one the these units. When it arrived, the setup was quick and painless.I put in a pair of new Seagate Barracuda 7200 1.5 drives purchased just for this purpose. It was up and running with no problems - for almost a week.Then it died. No lights, no response at all.I ordered a replacement from Amazon, which arrived two days later. I LOVE Amazon's return policy.The new unit was Dead On Arrival.Sorry - two strikes and you're out. I've returned both units and will buy something else besides D-Link."
3,Works good enough but keep this in mind!!,"This unit works fine from hardware point of view but user interface and capabilities are seriously lacking.* It is upposed to be a pretty high capacity data server but allows only 8 charachter passwords. This means my 16 char windows password will not match up ever. In this day and age of security concious world watch out. 8 charachters is by no means safe.* does not like windows unc paths, because when the NAS gives the password dialog, it shows only 'Guest' in the user ID and even that is disabled. In UNC paths (\\Server\Foleder), it is the norm with all networked devices, that they show a userID password dialog when not supplied. The only way is to Map the drive using the unc path and click on use alternate user link.* The front cover comes off with a slight touch even when you tilt the unit. This leaves everything inside bare too easily.* support is lousy. They do not know even basic stuff about the unit."
4,Impressive product,"The DNS-323 is an impressive add to any network. It combines an amazing cluster of features in one device. Print Server, Network Storage Device and Media Server (Does need some improvement here - Thumbnails for one). Easy to assemble (add your own hard drives) and simple to integrate into your network. Nice job D-Link!"
5,BEST NAS!,"Just what I needed!!! Matched it up with two 320GB SATA drives from frys, and got it up and running with RAID 1 in under 10 minutes(including formatting). I set it up so that it sends an email alerts right to my phone using teleflip.com, and mapped the FTP server to a DNS using dyndns.com for free!Using the latest 1.03 firmware."
3,Not for the Macintosh 10.5 I think User,I bought the DNS-323 in October it worked fine with OSX (10.4) but does not work with (10.5). Thank goodness I have Parallels. This whole mess could have been avoided if I read D-Link's documentation which states that they do not support OSX. I think it's time to buy a Drobo.......Well the problem seems to have been fixed it's working now. Time will tell.
1,Note all the 1-star reviews - Don't waste your money/time,"Great idea - poor product. Mine still doesn't work and their customer support was/is attrocious. Still trying to get them to replace it, but they want me to send it to Amazon, who won't take it past 30 days. I spent 40 days trying to get it to work. Don't bother."
2,"Good throughput, but bad security.","The only thing I like this device is the throughput. When you configure the Ethernet interface at 100/full, you can get 80mpbs.The security design is not good:1. Only allow 8 characters passwords and special characters are not allowed.2. Each time you add a user or group to a share, it creates a new share instead of adding to the share3. It does not support Chinese characters.If you want good throughput, Enginsh only, and don't care about security, it works."
4,Quaility control needs to wake up,First one had a power supply problem. Amazon replaced it very fast. All in all a great unit.
4,Great for long commutes,"My friend received one a Smart Mug for Christmas as a gift. When my husband heard about it he said he really wanted ""me"" to have one. I thought I would use it on a daily basis but it seems like too much work for my short commute to work each day so I only use it on long trips."
3,nice looking but....,"The image looks good on the site, but try and put it together when you do not receive any instructions."
2,Disappointed,"The item came with no instructions and part of the assembly was stickers that we're cut in half. Pretty much couldnt use the stickers that we're part of the display, and the instructions would have helped a lot."
5,Lucky Baldwin,"Book was exactly as described. In great condition and a First Issue that I have been looking for for many years. I would like to have at least 1 more First Issue.Thank you,RPS"
2,"seems to be really hit or miss, can't figure it out","I live in dry desert country and this humidifier is a godsend on dry days in the house. However, we bought it for overnight use and either it churns out copious amounts of steam and runs out within 3-4 hours, rendering it useless for an 8-hour overnight stretch, or it just sort of puffs pathetically, releasing tiny amount of steam throughout the night to where you don't even feel its effects. I've tried different additives (salt, baking soda) to figure out if it's a hard water/pH issue or whatever, and I can't figure it out. It's completely inconsistent, so we don't use it all that much. If I could go back I'd skip this one and get a 2-gallon humidifier instead in the hopes that it would at least get through the night."
1,Stopped working after three days. Do not recommend.,"Purchased the product and followed all directions, including mixing small amount of salt in water. After two days, little black plastic pieces began to fall apart from the humidifying mechanism into the basin. By the third day, the unit stopped working altogether.Unfortunately, I had thrown out the box by then so the unit found a new home in the rubbish.Flimsy, poorly constructed, not dependable. Would not recommend purchasing -price seems low but is high relative to the fact that it eventually became just a plastic bowl with a night-light. Pay more for a unit that works."
3,Junior's Review,"I ordered this for my 7 year old grandson. He loves it. It is more suitable for the children but it is an item that anyone can carry around in your pocket and pull out to play when you have a few spare moments with nothing to do. For those who grew up with these kind of games you may like it. My grandson wanted one because his Dad had one. I've always been amazed at how so much can be put in such a tiny package. Overall it is a pretty neat little item. However for anyone considering buying one I wouldn't overpay. Anything less that $20 is probably acceptable, paying more than that would likely leave you disappointed because the item is pretty small."
3,Troubles In Our Youth,"I bought this game for my girlfriend for Christmas. She would always get mad at me for playing God of War all the time on my PSP so I decided to get her something with similar specs, graphics and gameplay.This game is about teenage angst in suburban America and the pressure of having to live up the expectations of your father. DK Jr has struggled growing up as a member of the upper middle class and now he must find himself. Who IS he? Should he take a trip to Europe?I also liked this game because it reminded me of the Tiger Handhelds that I used to pretend to play inside of Target when I was 5."
4,One of my faves!,"I recieved this album a few years ago after its initial release, and it's always been nearby! I played Pilley for years on my radio show on WFDU and always got great responses.This album is truly where rock music ought to be going, rather than the direction it's currently heading. Pilley has taken her rock writing and interspersed it with her many years of formal training to come up with a very approachable musical stew.If you can pick this album up, snatch it. Currently, it's out of print, and you can't have mine!Then go to Pilley's website and tell her you want a follow-up!"
5,couldn't be happier,I love my new Danze faucet. It looks fabulous with my new soapstone countertops.It was easy to install and looks far more expensive than it was. Amazon's price was the best I found and I had my order the next day. I can't say enough good things about both the faucet and the service from Amazon.
3,"Joe's very cool, but...","There's no doubt Joe was one of the very best jazz guitar players ever, but as a teacher he was not especially gifted. On this cd is is actually pretty good about explaining the chords, but as far as single note lines goes, he sheds very little light."
5,I miss Lingua Franca,This was a terrific magazine -- People Magazine for the Academic Set. It broke my heart when they went out of business (taking the $50 I had sent them for a two-year subscription with them). The selection here is a good one.
3,OK -- but there are better choices,"I bought this book, Building Thinking Skills (Beginning and Primary) and Thinking Skills for Tests for my soon-to-be 5 YO twins. Honestly, this is their (and my) least favorite. I think the pages are a little crowded, somewhat hard to follow and the lack of color (for 4/5 YOs makes it not very engaging for them. They prefer the color pages of Building Thinking Skills and Thinking Skills for Tests. Albeit, they are a bit below the age range for this book, but I even kindergarteners would likely be more interested in colorful pages."
3,Great book for a 3-4yo,I honestly love this book and both my daughter and son love it as well. I purchased this book a few years ago to home school my daughter since we did not send her to preschool. She learned basic critical thinking skills in a fun way that made it easy for her to transition to harder books in order to pass the NYC G&T test. I started going over this book with my daughter when she was 4 a few years later and I am now working through this booklet with my 3 year old who also loves it. The questions are easy enough for a child to continue on there on one you explain the directions and go over the first sample question with them. I would give this book 5 stars if they advertised for the correct age range.
2,Very boring.. Better books out there.,My son loves logic games and was practicing for the gifted program. I purchased this book along with a few others from amazon. The cover looks nice and after reading about it I thought it would be engaging and a fun book we could do together. The book's inside is black and white and very boring with long instructions. It can't keep my 4 year old (or myself) interested for long at all. There are many many many other books on amazon that have the same quality but are presented in a much better way suitable for children.
1,was not what i saw on the net to buy,"the clamp that they showed was not the one that i resived,and the is very bad for buiness.i bought the clamps based on the photo that i saw ,and that is the clamp that i wanted. not this set of junk that they sent me,I AM VERY DISPLEASED,WITH THE CLAMPS.WILL NOT BE BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS ,BEFORE I FINE OUT WHAT I AM TRUELY GETTING FOR MY MONEY.."
1,No good,"I ordered this frog, for my 6 mo. old son, and niece. I was verydisappointed when I got it in the mail. It looks cheaply made, and Ithought the frog would make some kind of music, but it doesn't. I sent this item back to seller."
4,Good Humor and a little more in depth with the basics,"I ordered one for my nephew and decided to get one for myself. I'm still very, very ""touch 'n go"" with trueSpace3 and found it quite helpful. Swan seems pretty intuitive in the directions he takes and how he handles the subject matter. It sure covers a lot of things over looked the packaged manual. Hey, it's no trueSpace3 bible, but I'm glad I got it and it has really been a help in covering some obscure issues. Good job!"
5,A great book from one of the Great Artist on the tS Mailing,"This is one of the best books that I own. It is clear and concise concerning the in and outs of trueSpace 3. I use it daily to help me use and understand tS3. I would recommend this for the ""beginner"" to the ""expert"" who uses trueSpace 3 to create stunning graphics or even VRML worlds. This is A MUST HAVE book."
5,"funny,informative and easy to understand.","When you take into account the fact that the book is easy to understand, has great examples, a value packed cd rom and can get you up and running in no time its a defintie must have! mark bank"
4,Good book for tS3 beginners,"This is a perfect book for anyone just beginning to learn tS3. It should have included coverage of tS3's powerful physical simulation features, but what the hey. Any problems with the book are more than offset by the spectacular FIGURE 6 in the color section."
1,Celestial Navigation for the Complete Idiot,"You will be a complete idiot if you spend money on this. This is a referral video to buy other videos. It doesn't even show you a sextant closer than 20 feet. I did giggle at some of his humor, but overall worthless."
4,It's a Barbie Birthday Party!,"""Celebrate with Barbie and her two totally hip friends, Lisa and Stephanie. They'll take you on a worldwide adventure through Walt Disney World Epcot, and go behind the scenes to experience the making of the fabulous live Magical World of Barbie Stage Show. Without ever leaving Epcot, Lisa and Stephanie have fun with pinatas in Mexico, origami in Japan, pasta in Italy, and more! You'll meet friends from all over the world who send along special birthday wishes for Barbie.WOW! It's time to get ready for the Barbie Stage Show, Lisa and Stephanie will take you backstage where you'll experience everything from set builing to hair styling. What's more, you'll actually see Barbie and her friends dancing and singing in great costumes in an exciting peek of the show. You'll love every action-packed minute! Happy Birthday Barbie!"""
4,One Good Read!,"Alec Clayton's Until The Dawn is indeed a wise, wonderful, gritty and honest book. A masterful visual artist himself, Clayton knows how to put pictures in words as well, and along with treating the reader to a moving canvas that encompasses the South of the depression and the sixties, shows us the hardass, cutthroat, coke-snorting art world of New York City in the 1980s. One example will show how good this book is as the reader sees Clayton's sexually-confused artist hero attempting ""to find an abstract form that spoke of the faded, Army green aura of alcoholics sleeping on the sidewalks, ashen faces and dull, boozy-pink rims around whitened eyes."" This is the real thing. Readers should grab it immediately and enjoy!"
4,Filler for free shipping!,"While I added this item to my cart primarily to take me into free shipping awesomeness I did appreciate that this item isn't complete junk. It's actually useful for hanging stuff on your walls. Of course they leave little pinholes where you pinned something up but it's small enough not to matter. Price is good, items works as described. NO com"
1,terrible packaging,"The small box came smashed, most of the tacks were lost in transit, only received 15 tacks out of 100."
3,Good Build Quality and Price,"These thumb tacks are of good build quality and are fairly priced.When I order batches of things in the 100s though I typically receive just over a hundred of said item. When this box came and it looked to be shy of 100 I decided to count. Indeed there were 97 of them in the box. Close to 100 but I've grown accustomed to receiving at least what is stated on the box if not more. The box also looks to have been taped closed by packing tape and the box was in a rough condition. The only reasons I'm giving it three stars is because of the miscount of tacks and mistreatment of the box they came in, otherwise I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars."
2,Not so great,"I've been doing step aerobics for a long time, and this video was not one I got much out of. If you want a good step video/DVD, choose Gin Miller or Kathy Smith. They're big hitters."
1,What a waste of time!!!! (and money),"If I could, I would give it less than 1 star! If you're looking for a Denise Austin step tape, first try the good will. I bet you'll find plenty there. This was not a workout at all!!! Her voice is so irritating and she NEVER stops talking."
3,For the Beginner,I bought this video some time ago and although it is a basic workout it was a great introduction to Step. I still get a good workout when I do the tape and feel like I've actually been challenged. The moves are basic though and it is only towards the end that I am actually working hard I skip the toning part of the tape.
3,Ho hum,"IF you can stand Denise's super chatty style, this one is okay if you need a quick workout but don't expect a real burn or even much sweat unless you're a true beginner. If you are, this one is a great introduction to step and can really get your heart rate up but if you've been at it even three times a week for a few months, this one is good if you're short on time or having a low-energy day."
5,Well researched and written by Phillips,Phillips obviously researched his topic thoroughly and has great insight into Jackson and the reasons Missouri found its identity with the southern states.Phillips weaves his story masterfully. Well done.
4,Stick with it,"All the praise and all the criticisms in the polarizing reviews here are accurate. The format of the book is a challenge, no doubt. It doesn't have a linear structure, it goes on tangents and jumps around in no logical order (well, except for alphabetical). At first this was annoying to me, but as I read on the beauty of the approach became clearer .. by taking chronology out of the narrative, we see Armed Forces in its totality, and the focus is on the end result of the process of making the album rather than focusing on the process itself. If you're an EC fan, I recommend this, but be prepared for an unconventional read that takes some getting used to."
4,chinese mystery,This mystery is a bit chilling. It brings up the obvious but not so obvious problems with the one child policy and how China is struggling with their over population and how people respond as well as the more personal story of expatriates who live and love China.
1,Not My Cup of Tea (so to speak),"I simply can't believe the reviews done on this book. These reviewers must all be friends, neighbors or relatives of Peter May. I thought I'd give the book a try as my wife and I visited Beijing in 1996 and I figured the travel experience would make the book that much more interesting. Swing and a miss. I made it through the first 100 pages, then gave up. I found the writing sophomoric and the editing poorly done. The characters were shallow and the story line was slow to develop. I won't be reading any more of Peter's books. Once and out."
4,Fantastic album,"As others have said, this is a great album from a great band, and I hope that others beyond the metro NY area clue in soon, too! ""You're So Beautiful"" is easily the best song on the album. Well worth the money."
5,Pat Mcguire Band,"I stumbled accross this band at a Green Port street fair, and it only took me one second to decide that I had to have this. What a stage pressence this gent has, what a beautiful arrangments, ""Going to the desert"" is soo beautiful, I cry every time, and If he should be playing somewhere I would make every effort to see him.. Last night to my ammazment he was on this movie, playing in the backround, course I noticed him right off the bat,the movie is called ""Soothing"". I love this band, his music, its so inspirational."
3,GOOD PRODUCTG,Wasn't personally for my use but didn't hear any complaints from ther person that requested it so it must have met their needs.
1,Dissapointment,I bought this as a Chrismas gift for my 3 year old. The horse doesn't move when she gets on it to ride. Thank God she has a big brother to pull her around on it or it would have been a total waste.
5,mom still has marvel in our flower bed.--- he is great !!!,"I loved him dearly, very great friend too. he stands in our flowerbed today 33years after my 1st. birthday. We would love to buy another one today..... thanks"
2,Mustang Marvel,I was disappointed that the mechanism that makes the horse go up and down is very stiff and does not allow a small child under the age of five to work it. I don't know if I received a defected product. I would be interested to know if you have had this comment before. My four year old that weighs 40 lbs.can not make the horse work. It says that children under 60 lbs. should not use it.I would appreciate your response.Lisa Ficarra Shepherd
3,Marvel isn't so marvelous,"The mustang is beautiful, but functionally, it's below average. The horse is so stiff that my 2 year old son cannot make it move. Adjustments to make it more flexible don't work. The engineers for Marvel need to do more work on this mustang."
5,great old fashion looking toy,"This is the greatest I bought it for one child and it went through two of them and my three year old loves it wont get on a bike, just wants to ride his horsey. But alas the hand grip has broken off and I might have to buy a new one."
3,hard to get moving,"My daughter is 3 and a half and 34 pounds. She is unable to get the horse moving very far, its legs flatten out. We have ajusted the spring action to its maximum. She dose love her horse but does not ride it. It may work better with a child who weighs less. If I could, I would return the horse. The operational directions are poor. If I had had one as a child, as so many of the reviewers listed had, then perhaps I would be able to help my daughter. The reviews here sold me on the horse and that is way I felt I needed to share our experience."
1,Toyed with a 2-star,"But I just couldn't go there. This is bad stuff, Drags out...silly creature(s)...lame ending...mechanical acting...""Terminatorish"" voice overs at the beginning and the end...and one of the dumbest last lines in a movie I can think of."
5,Makes Science Fun! (great illustrations too!),"This book introduces chemistry to kids in a fun and exciting way. Dr. Keck does not talk down to her audience, as many science writers do. She does present many important science topics (such as polymers and pH) that I have never seen discussed in any other children's science book. The illustrations are fantastic, done by up-and-coming artist Thomas Plunk. Great slime recipie too!"
5,great gift,"what a wonderful gift for a little child who loves cats! Arrived quickly, in fabulous condition.I believe that she loved it"
5,Very Sweet Book for young kids,"My 6 year-old granddaughter read this all by herself to her 4 year-old brother--it's so sweet it almost made us both cry several times. The pictures are wonderful too--we couldn't decide if they were photographs, but we think they are, and I don't have access to the book from here. Highly recommend this book--wish it came in hardback!"
4,Adorable....,"Love this adorable book about kitties. Has beautiful photos of the cat and kittens and a cute story. The only drawback is that the example of the pet owner's actions is not a great one; lets the kitten keep getting outside, has it in situations and lets it play with articles that are unsafe for a cat, but I think it gives the reader a good opportunity to point out to the child these flaws in the care of the kitten, and give the child a better understanding of what a responsible pet owner should do for their pet. I think it is a valuable and hearttouching book and if used properly, a great learning tool! And for smaller children, great pictures for them to look at and enjoy!"
1,DIDN'T RECIEVE ORDER,"This supplier stinks! Ordered CD on 11/22/02, it's now 12/28/02 ans I still have not seen the CD. I have emailed the company 3 times now, and have recieved no reply from them, and have no idea where the order is."
5,Leave your umbrella at home,"Raindrops compiles songs from a number of Free Design LPs ('You Could Be Born Again', 'Songs For Very Important People', 'Heaven/Earth', 'One By One' and others released around 1968 -1970). There's originals and also a bunch of covers in the distinctive FD style (just as identifiable as say Nino and April or The Carpenters, for example).Everything's great, I love what they do to California Dreamin (giving it an major energy boost) and Feelin' Groovy has rarely sounded better. They more than do justice to Bacharach (Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, Dionne Warwick's Windows of the World) plus there's a great version of The Beatles Michelle.You are My Sunshine is the best version ever recorded and Pineapple Crabapple would simply be a great title if it wasn't such a cool song. By gum, they even cover Billy Strange!Packaging is beautiful as you may well expect from the classy folks at Siesta!"
1,MIXED FEELINGS,"This book is a very disappointing experience for me. While this book is very good reading, and exciting and well written, it is not at all what I thought it was when I bought it.The dustjacket notes expalin that this is the further adventures of Sir Hugh of Taranto, who first appeared in the novel ""Durandal,"" written by Harold Lamb. ""Durandal"" is a series of three stories first published in seperate editions of Adventure Magazine, and then later published as a novel. (I've posted a review of ""Durandal"" on Amazon.com. Great book. Read it. You'll love it.)But the problem with ""Sea of the Ravens,"" is that it does not continue where ""Durandal"" ended. ""Ravens"" is part of ""Durandal""--the middle part actually--just rebound and sold under a seperate cover. Maybe the publisher thinks this is a pretty funny little joke. But for [the cost], I am not laughing.Do no buy this book. Buy and enjoy ""Durandal,"" but avoid ""The Sea of Ravens."""
4,Replay ain't all its cracked up to be,"Being a Nintendo player since I was six I don't own a Playstation so I've not yet been able to play a RE game. So I went out and bought this. I wish I had a RAM pack because the graphics are weak sometimes. The lack of ammo and health herbs makes it challenging. But each character has to essentially solve the same puzzles, fight the same bad guys. The police station is too long and Leon's ending is a let down. With a reputation like RE has I was expecting a more replayable game. But its challenging and its rare that a games scared me enough to make jump out of my seat."
5,A Port That Beats the Original,"Usually, ported games end up being EXACTLY the same as the original. Not in this game. CAPCOM has made an excellent job of making this game new enough for N64 owners to enjoy. The graphics are excellent. ALL the FMV are in the 64MB cartridge. Best game I've played since Zelda!"
3,Good but not Great,"I dont have much anything to say but when I bought this game I could not wait to play it and when I did I only played it for about 30 minuets and the best levels it had was level 3 and 5 otherwise this game is not as good as the first one.SO RENT BEFORE YOU BYE IT,IF YOU BYE IT WITH OUT RENTING IT YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,crashes alot,Controls takes some getting used to and the cam sometimes prevents you from seeing what's about to attack you and MOST of all this games crashes too many darn times!!
5,The BEST and ONLY Survival Horror game for N64,"Although RE2's cinemas were staticy and the dialogue was a bit off, it is the best S/H game out for N64. It defenitely beats out its PSX counterpart, and it's combined in a double sized N64 cartridge. Pure Genius. A great game, it will scare you."
3,stupid,"it's a good story line and all but the game sucks! i was enthusiastic about this game but after 2 mins. i was depressed. it is propperly scary but the camera angles and the controles don't work well together.Capcom,better luck next time."
1,This game sucks!,"Terrible, horrible, very bad. May be the worst game I ever played! I despise it and it's just no fun at all."
3,okay this is one of my favorite RE games,okay i like this game becasue its the most fun one to play more than RE4 but if i saw this as a movie this is complete Hollywood Like Batman and Robin. Hollywood castLeonadio Decaprio as Leon S KenndyJesscia Albea as Clair RedfieldCharlize Theron from Aeon Flux as Ada WongFramke Janssen as Annette BirkinIoan Gruffudd as Willam BrikenDanny Davito as Brian IronsClive Owen as Ben BertolucciWill Smith as Marvin Branagh the Black guy 1st to die in the gameAriel Gade as Sherry BirkenKarl Urban as Hunk3 star was for its story i didnt like how Willam Kills himself with a shot for revenge
3,"A good game, but why bother when RE3 just came out?","It's really surprising that they have found a way to decrompress so much data onto a cart, and end up making the game better than it's predecessor, but when you think about it, it's still the same old game. Resident Evil 3 came out around the same time, and that's better. Still a good buy, however."
1,Nintendo Flubs Another One,"Resident Evil 2 for the Playstation always has and always will be one of my favourite games, so I was incredibly excited to see that it had come out for the N64. After having played it I was happy to see that they had the FMVs more or less, but the game just didn't feel right with the 64 controller, and the idea of changing the colour of the blood is all fine and dandy for Turok but it has no place in Resident Evil. Also Nintendo has seen it fit to make this game less dark and dreary than the Playstation version which I think was a poor choice. If you only own a N64 and want to play a survival horror game rent it, if you don't care about survival horror much or own a Playstation or Dreamcast don't even bother looking at this game."
2,a difficult fit,"For some reason, in reading this, I had difficulty fitting myself into the story. The locale almost seemed desgned to be a bubble isolated from the rest of the world. I would have to agree also with another reviewer the sense of disjointment. There were a number of places in the book where the author seems to abruptly slip between thoughts and never clue the reader in. Characterization seems poor, or I at least had difficulty identifying with any. I had another difficulty and that was the much too quick acceptance of the phenomenon of time travel by other characters throughout the story, and the poorly researched character of 1908. The author has a nice time travel concept but does little with it that is enjoyable for the reader."
2,"Not bad, not GREAT","This time-travel story did not grab me the way TIME AND AGAIN (Jack Finney) did. There are several intersecting plot lines centering around the main character, Josh Winkler, and some of them seem rather contrived. The method of getting to the past, by walking quickly along certain ""paths"" in the town, seems capricious and awkward. At least in Finney's world there is a reasonable technique (a kind of self-hypnosis coupled with deep study about the desired time period) that allows the subject to slip the bonds of current time.The fact that marital relations are lost as a result of the time travel in this novel really bothered me; it seemed to be a perversion of what was happening with the other plotlines, in which problems were solved, not created. Or perhaps my reaction just reflects how I would feel if I were to ""lose"" my wife in this manner.In any case, this is not a novel that I will reread."
4,Short Review,"Time travel is always a fun subject for a novel and this short romp is quite entertaining. It all starts when a rather ordinary man finds he's moved back in time 15 minutes. From there, the plot thickens and I hate to spoil it with details. The novel centers around a swirl of events around a few of the main characters moving through time - with no control over how far, or which direction they go. The story is fast paced and at is a real page turner. I could hardly put it down. The main flaw is ending, which doesn't quite make total sense logically.But I do admit this is a book a thought about long after reading it."
3,A (Slightly) Different Opinion,"I prefer a book whose action flows, where events and characters do not bevome so convoluted that the sheer enjoyment wears thin. In many places in this book, I found myself having to really ponder what was happening and to whom it was happening. I also was not particularly fond of any of the characters."
3,"Strong start, weak finish","Josh Winkler, a less than ordinary man, but a believable, like-able character, his wife, child and town are torn by a somewhat unbelievable episode of time travel. He travels 15 minutes into the past and disrupts his life forever. The tangle he creates is suspenseful and involves everyone he touches.The novel starts out very strong, with good characterization and concept, but weakens with each passing page. At the end, the characters become a mere 2 dimensional shell of what they were at the beginning of the tale.This is a fun and suspenseful story for the first 1/3 of the book and then becomes tedious and tiring. It feels as if the author just ran out of steam and inspiration at the end, threw up his hands and says, ""I quit.""A shame.... the concept was good and it started off well......"
3,Short Review of A Shortcut in Time,"Not one of the best time travel yarns that I have read. Still, the concept of the book was original and the characters were rather well developed"
2,Boring and disjointed,"This book was a bitter disappointment. I made it through to see if it ever got any better. The characters were not ""normal"" in any way, and it was impossible to identify with any of them. It is a strange book that is completely unbelievable. I did not find it in the least entertaining.I don't like to write negative reviews, but I wish the ones I had read hadn't been so glowing...I'd have saved my money!"
1,Why was this published?,"This book started very well. It had me interested, curious, thinking ahead. Good signs for a book. But then some holes start to appear and they slowly get bigger and bigger. And then after 287 pages it just ends on page 288. How did this get past the editors? Was this a joke by the publisher? ""Hey lets see how many people will buy a incomplete book?""The story was very interesting until he gets back to his ""second time around"" life. There are lots of hints leading you to think there is more to it. But nothing leads anywhere and all of a sudden it is over. What about the brother? How can there be a daughter if there was never a union with the mother? Time travel flaw!!I just can't get past how angry I am about the way this just fizzled out! I don't understand how others can give it a good review. It started strong and just FIZZLED and then THUD!!!!I am P#$$ed Off!"
2,A Shortcut in Time,"Based on the reviews I read here in Amazon, I decided to check this book out of the library. I liked it quite a bit while I was reading it and even recommended it to my sister. We both happened to finish the book on the same day and spoke on the phone that night. It seems we had the exact same reaction when it came to the last page: ""Is that it?!!??'.It was SUCH an unsatisfying ending (the worse I've ever come across) that I even checked to make sure no pages were torn from the book.I gave it two stars instead of one because I didn't hate the book, just the very last page.One I'd recommend strongly is Jack Finney's book Time and Again. I started on that after A Shortcut in Time. It's a fiction novel but includes drawings of late 1800 New York City done by the main character in the book."
5,A Must Read for Time Travel fans,"It took me three months to read Time and Again by Jack Finney, which I liked but it was a long haul. A Shortcut in Time cranked at record speed. I read it in two days - could not put it down! I'm a huge fan of time travel books with The Mirror and The Time Traveler's Wife as two of my favorites. A Shortcut in Time has quickly been added to my favorites list. What a great find. What a great read. Extremely well written. I loved this book!"
2,What the...!,"I just finished this book, and like other reviewers, am bewildered by the ending. I guess the author had a deadline, and just sent them what he had...RIGHT NOW? I dunno.You have the protagonist, Josh, married with a daughter. He travels through time, just a 15 minute blip into the past, and then when his daughter Penny goes missing, he finds through microfilm in the library that she disappeared further into the past, 1918, and died of Spanish Influenza. He goes back to 1918 to find her and learns that Penny doesn't want to return to the present. When he returns to the present himself, he finds he changed history somehow, and that his life is totally different. So here is where the story might have gotten good - really interesting.But this is where all plot development goes away. The author sets the scene, then doesn't take it anywhere except to an abrupt ending that -- (see how it feels?)"
2,Don't blink....,"This book was entertaining but it's sad ending overshadowed the storyline.It made me think... what? Don't blink at the end or you'll miss it. I went back and reread the last few pages a couple of times hoping that I had missed something but alas, that is how it ends. It's too bad because it really was good up to that point. I would not recommend this book."
5,A delightful journey!,"How would your life change if you went only fifteen minutes into the past? Thus begins the trials of Josh Winkler, whose lackadaisical world is turned upside down when he accidently slips through a rip in time...but only travels fifteen minutes into his past. The resulting fallout changes his world, and everyone around him.Dickenson has written a wonderful romp of a tale that tweaked my imagination and made me think about the concept we know as time. Though I thought that the protagonist, Josh, was a bit unlikable, the writing drew me forward, as did the story itself. Though he's compared to the likes of Jonathan Carroll, I'd say Dickenson is a better storyteller."
3,If time travel worked...,"I agree with what most other readers have been saying regarding the incredibly abrupt ending. I was thinking...if time travel did work and the author had his protagonist's ability to jump back in time, he could grab another 15 minutes to give himself time to finish the damn story!"
1,apparently the ending got lost in time.,"i had hoped for yet another good time travel book, like 'time and again' et al, but this is really a disappointment. you should read the other reviews rated one star about the lack of a satisfactory ending. this is my complaint too. with a great theme the book really gets your attention, but i suspect the author didn't have a good ending when he started and never found one either. skip this one. dgs"
1,shortcut to nowhere,"I was waiting for something to happen, but it went nowhere and then just as suddenly, ended. Not sure why others would give this a good review. Maybe different tastes. But in my opinion this book was not written very well, left me with tons of unanswered questions, and just left me feeling disappointed.I love the whole time travel idea, but this book doesn't make it fun, or interesting or exciting or anything."
1,Too difficult for children!,I bought this toy for my boys a few years ago because they had enjoyed playing with a marble run game at a friend's house. I thought this toy bould be even better since it was wood instead of plastic. I was wrong! The toy is difficult to balance just right so that the marble will go through it. The giraffe and bell pieces also broke very quickly. It is better to stick with wood for blocks and plastic for marble mazes!
1,Couldn't agree more,"I was going to write up a review after I purchased this for my 3.5 year old son for Christmas. When I got here and read everyone elses ""spot on"" reviews of the toy, I knew I didn't need to say anything more. This toy is exactly like everyone else says; extremely difficult to get working and the balancing act one must achieve is beyond belief.I told my son I would return it to Santa's Workshop and get him a toy that worked properly."
4,"Very sturdy, children have played with it often.","This is a well-made, solid marble set. I expect it will last for years. There are never-ending ways to set it up. I highly recommend it.. but, I think I paid a lot less for it. The price of $57+ seems too high; I would shop around for better pricing."
1,This product is horrible- don't buy it!,"This product is horrible! Alex Toys claims that their product won a Parents Best Toy Award. I sincerely doubt that is possible! I even checked and it wasn't part of the 2007 Parent Best Toy Awards so I'm not sure what year they're claiming to have won with this toy.These pieces are poorly constructed. The marbles gets stuck or fall off the path constantly. I can't get any of the three designs shown on the box to work, even after going to Alex Toys' website and printing out their instructions. The pieces are not the right height to get any of the designs to work and they keep falling over! Even my husband, a Mechanical Engineer, couldn't get this to work!I'm frustrated, my son is frustrated, and now I have to hassle with trying to get a full refund of my money!DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! You'll be sorry if you do!"
5,We love the marble maze.,"I got it for my 3 (almost 4) year old for Christmas, and it has been a favorite of our 3 year old and 5 year old boys, as well as his parents and grandparents. It's attractive, sturdy, and inspires creative play. Everyone can play with it at his or her own level, and my boys love anything involving marbes."
3,It's good for what it is.,"Don't go about thinking this is a book for someone who wants to know what Asterisk is all about. The book is very specific to business applications and it does not treat more than a few configurations and case studies. It's very understandable, but it's not a book to read if you want to understand PBX design."
3,Too simplistic,"This is a good book for ASterisk/VoIP beginners only. I was expecting much more than this. It was written in a very simplistic way, which is good for beginners no question. It doens't provide any form of Troubleshooting, even for the most common known problems (example: NAT)"
4,"Slightly outdated, but straight to the point","While this book is ""old"" in terms of when it was first published for the computing world, but it is straight to the point. I bought it to investigate what I would need to do in order to setup a PBX for my small business. It's actually so straight to the point that I wasn't able to do much beyond the first couple of chapters because it pretty much requires you to have a machine that you can install software on and use to test and experiment with -- which I don't have yet. So if you're committed to getting going on an Asterisk PBX, this book would probably serve as a good resource to you."
2,A glaring error,"We wasted a few days because one of our guys read this book, and used the {exten:1} syntax that's listed in the book, instead of the correct ${EXTEN:1} variable syntax. Looks like something small, but we lost time because of it."
2,nothing brilliant here at all,"Really nothing more than some rather sophmoric musings about how the digital age will revolutionize life as we know it. Tapscott uses his 10-year old daughter's thoughts as his primary source for inspiration.Unfortunately, if you're at all involved in the Net field, you're not going to find anything Tapscott says interesting nor revolutionary."
2,Bland generalizations about technology's impact,"I rushed out get this book after reading 'Being Digital' by Negroponte. Digital Economy makes references to Negroponte. And it quickly became clear who had the original ideas. Negroponte made me think out of the box about the digital world. Digital Economy is all inside the box. And if you're aware of the state of the art , this is boring."
5,Mental Exercise for Forward Thinking Individuals,"The Digital Economy is an excellent book for readers that need a clear understanding of how a digital world will change our lives. Tapscott describes examples that readers interact with daily. This is a must read for executives of corporations that want to understand why their IT budgets represent such a large portion of their revenues. Tapscott also points out the efficiencies of a digital world and describe the paradigm shift from previous ""reengineering"" exercises that most corporations embraced"
1,"Book of Management Buzz Words, Contains no Practical Info.","I hate wasting time and money, and that is precisely what this book accomplished.Being a IS professional, I purchased this book hoping to gain some insight into future happenings. However, all I got was a thousand quotes and some not so revolutionary visions of the future.Point in case, his analysis of why Business Process ReEngineering will not work in the ""Digital Economy"", says nothing specific on why/how things will change. Instead, its a bunch of Management Buzz words, which you'll waste your time reading.A much more readable book (albeit older) on this subject is ""The Road Ahead"" By Bill Gates. Instead of quoting other CEOs and CIOs he tells his own story about the future. Plus, you will not fall asleep as often as reading ""Digital Economy""."
1,The Cellutite Secret - Bad Binding!,"This book is bound on the top and is very difficult to handle and read.There is repetitive information and it's a bit too simple.This is a complicated subject and some of the coverage sounds amaturish. If you have never heard any information on cellulite, it may be good to read."
5,"Anyone who hates cellulite, read this book!","If you're reading this review, chances are you have cellulite, it's ok, even supermodels have it, or so I found out from this book! Do you know how good that makes me feel? I can't say enough about this book it's easy to read, takes a realistic approach to the problem and has boosted my confidence! Don't miss out!"
1,WAY too small. Looks like a girl's watch.,"I received this watch previously very excited about the idea of having a very traditional men's watch, however when I opened the box, I was quickly checking the label thinking that perhaps I had been sent the girl's version. However, I received the correct version, however the watch is just WAY too small and shaped funny (compared to most pictures of it). I promise that if you wear this, people will question you. Way too small, and it doesn't look near as good as the pictures online make it appear."
4,seiko mens watch,"We bought this watch as a gift for my FIL. It is a beautiful watch however, it is extremely lightweight. I prefer a watch with some weight to it and this one lacks that, however it fit the bill as a nice gift. For the price I would prefer a little more weight though. Other than that, it is a watch that can be worn daily."
4,all's well except face,as another purchaser stated the bright silve face is impossible to seein bright light. Everything else is excellent.
5,Gts two tone seiko watch,This watch is perfect for a working man. It is water resistent and goes with everything--casual and formal. My husband absolutely loves it. I purchased it and received it VERY quickly.
5,Consistent Quality,"Got my first Seiko 21 years ago; it's as old as my oldest daughter. Unfortunately, I lost it recently. It was still keeping great time. My wife replaced it with this model and I'm expecting the same great performance. It looks great and keeps time... What more do you want?"
4,"Sturdy, comfortable beautiful watch","I bought this watch for my husband and he loves it, because it is two tone it goes with everything and he find himself using it more than the others."
2,Product different from illustration,"This is the third time I have bought this watch over the last ten years or so. The first two failed in exactly the same way - one of the little gold colored bars which are hour indicators became unglued. It rattles around and stops the hour, minute, or second hands from moving and stops the watch.This time the watch arrived but the face was different. Instead of the seemingly white colored and matte finish face, it is highly reflective and polished metal surface. It is so reflective it dazzles you with the reflections in daylight or regular indoor lighting at night. So I am having to keep wriggling the watch around to the right angle so I can read the time.I have had it about three weeks now, and wish I had returned it."
1,Seiko Watch,"The Seiko watch was from MrWatch thru Amazon. The watch arrived with a defective clasp on the band. MrWatch WOULD not replace it because it was worn. They considered taking the watch out of the box and putting it on the wrist being used and would not repair or refund. They referred me to Seiko. To return it to them I must pay postage, insurance etc.MrWatch advertises a 365 day NO hassel refund policy.THIS IS NOT TRUE. THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING WITH THIS NEW WATCH. It was delivered on Friday and of course they were closed until Monday when I called and by this time they considered it used. Very convenient for them."
3,its not as good as Dr Mario...,"I was so excited when i saw this game available....but it just doesnt match up to the old tetris and dr. mario... its all i could find for x box 360 though...It is fub for a while, but eventually, you just get bored."
3,:),"i really wish this was like the old school tetris that was with the nintendo, it gets really confusing when your playing"
2,Is not ONLY about fun factor,"First of all, this is tetris, you will have fun with it.But, is not a good one execution of a tetris game, is not even the best tetris you will find for xbox 360.Taste asides, I think the music is poorly selected, poorly secuenced and actually disturbing, if you are at level 10 and start thinking about what's that noise instead how to place the tetrino, is not a good thing.It doesn't help that you can't select a random music and background, so you MUST take time to change the selection MANUALLY for each game. And to do this, you must FIGHT your way trough very sluggish menues.The graphic design is also lackluster, from the confusing queue line to the translucid matrix that make you loose tetrinos depending on the background image, specially the blue ones.If I have to do it again, I probably would choose Tetris Splash from the Arcade, wich cost less than 10 bucks, is a lot better at music and graphics and you can fire up directly from the HD w/o changing discs."
3,Great Game If You DON'T Have Xbox LIVE,"Here it is in a nutshell, folks. I read the reviews first and decided to purchase the game. The game is ok. The graphics are sharp and anti-aliasing isn't really utilized much here. It LOOKS and FEELS like the regular old Tetris.The Xbox Live play is kinda lame because you're paired up against kids who are INSANE. I've lost the last 10 games because I (a novice at BEST) was paired against a kid who not only mopped the floor with me in terms of speed, but he ALSO organized by RAINBOW. WTF! HOLY BAJEZUZ!Anyway, I REGRET buying this game because you can DOWNLOAD a BETTER VERSION off Xbox Live. The Xbox Live version is new age, has animated backgrounds, and is a LOT more fun. I tried the trial for free and will eventually end up buying the full version since this one is a little bit lame.Take it from someone who's played both. SKIP this one unless you're going to buy it for $10.00 at a tagsale."
3,Bogus batteries or drill?,"I used this drill to put timberlocks into engineered lumber, and they died too fast. But I used same type (voltage, hp and etc.) batteries form other Bosch drill, and they died as fast as original ones. So I think batteries are not strong enough for this drill. Bosch needs to come up with so radical ideas here."
3,great drill--battery is ridiculously terrible,"Not sure I'd get this again simply because the battery doesn't last, and I got this to make laying decking easier. I'm a journeyman carpenter, so I know what stands up and what doesn't--and others have said the same thing--plus what is written here. Bosch should take this to heart, because they are making some great hardy tools of late."
1,Had to send it back two times!,"I am so disappointed in this watch I bought for my father. The design of the clasp is faulty so I sent it back when I received it and ordered a new one. When I got the second one it had the same faulty clasp. I took it to my watchmaker who told me that it is just a badly made clasp because Seiko is no longer made in Japan, but instead in China and with cheaper metal.What a shame we always relied on Seiko, but not anymore. Don' waste your time with this watch, my $15 Timex is 100% better in quality and one tenth of Seiko's inflated price."
3,"This is a battery-operated, not an automatic","I was shopping for an automatic watch, and this one came up. Maybe I'm dumb for not Googling ""quartz"" but I wanted to let others know this is NOT an automatic watch. When the battery runs out, you have to pay to have it replaced, and once the factory seal is broken (to unscrew the back and replace the battery), I have been told, it is not the same quality. This is probably more Amazon's fault than Seiko, but I wanted an automatic, and I saw nothing on the page that mentioned a battery or an estimated battery life - so I gave it a ""three star""."
4,Seiko Watch,This watch is very much like the Rolex in appearance which gives it a rich look. It has a day/date window and is easy to set. The quartz movement makes it an excellent timekeeper. My only negative comment is the hands are not easily seen because they are the same color as the background dial. I've owned another Seiko watch for 25 years that was trouble free and expect this new watch to be the same. Seiko makes a great product.Ray
3,Gold Time,"There is no question when it has came down to watches, Seiko has really made some good ones over the years. They have really shown it mostly well, but there are a few watches that could've been better in style. This Seiko Gold-tone is definitely a simple example. While the watch looks good, the bracelet is more flabby on the watch than strong, sturdy or straight than most other watches on the market. Still, you do get a fairly good fine watch at a good price. But overall, if you're looking for a better gold-tone watch, try another watch, even Seiko has better Gold-tone watches that are more worth their money in style than this one showed.Price: C+Comfort & Setup: C 1/2+Overall: C+"
5,Very Satisfied,"This is the first dress watch I've had for several years and from previous experience I sought out a Seiko. The first Seiko I had was purchased in Japan in 1967 and still worked when I lost it about 25 years later. This watch is very nice, seems to keep perfect time and looks ""rich"".I highly recommend this product and would buy again."
4,Anne Geddes,"How can you not like something done by Anne Geddes, the babies are adorable as always and the story is cute."
5,LOVE IT!,"Are you pondering what I'm pondering? Sure, but horizontal stripes make me look hippy.A must for any fan. The best part (really!) is the extra material with Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen -- they are as intelligent, witty and friendly with each other as you'd ever hope. Restores your faith in humanity."
4,Pinky and the Brain,"I must say that i found this combined vol. 1 and 2 very good value for money being in NZ i havent been able to locate this in any stores here and found it well priced... i also enjoyed watching all the episodes i use to watch on tv, i forgot how good this cartoon really was...a must for the pinky and the brain fan :)"
3,Too Pink,"Love the show, but [yes, this is ironic] the cartoon is coming up too pink on my system [CyberHome DVD and Toshiba HD-TV]. All of my video set-up is well calibrated, so I'm pretty sure its the DVD. So far I've only watched the first two episodes, maybe later ones will be better..."
5,"Great product, repaired my Keene's :)","After several years of putting my Keene water sandals to great use, the bottom of the soles split from the uppers. Rather than replacing them immediately (high cost) I decided it was worth at try to repair. First I used a general adhesive waterproof adhesive I had sitting around the house. Not a good idea, as the soles split off again in the middle of a river trip.I ordered this after checking reviews, applied and let the sandals sit for a full 24 hours. Eureka, problem solved! The Keene's are as good as new, with the soles once again solidly in place."
1,outdoor recliner- pacific outdoors,Do not buy these chairs. I have had them one month. The seat fabric has already ripped away from the grommets holding it to the frame. Bolts have fallen out and one chair collapsed. For $97.00 I expected more. Not even one season! I will try to get Pacific Outdoors to make good on this but...
3,Nice heavy chair,"This is a nice heavily constructed chair, but the locks to hold the position of the chair are not designed very well. They are a little tough to lock and don't hold really well."
3,"Maybe it is just me, but I cannot get it to recline","I cannot get this ""recliner"" to recline when I am sitting it no matter how hard I try using the instructions and help from the manufacturer's customer service line. I am way under the weight limit for this chair, so I cannot figure out why it will only recline if I am NOT sitting in it (and you must be seated in it in order to get it to stay in a reclining position). The reasons I am keeping it: 1. Too much trouble to send it back 2. I hope a friend or family member will be able to figure it out and teach me how to recline it 3. It is attractive and comfortable and I needed a new chair for the patio. Update: it is me! No matter how hard I try I cannot get it to recline, but bigger, stronger people get it to recline with ease. So if you are of averge size and strength, fear not!"
2,Had to do some work to this to improve it's condition.,"I had to add my own ties to the book, but it was at a used price."
5,Great,"great product. It's not great as just a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but it is great at smoothing out wrinkles. I think it's made me look a lot younger than before I started using it, going by the comments I get from people and from comparing old photos with what I look like when I use it regularly. I tend to use this and the derma E vitamin E cream together because vitamin E cream is more moisturizing, and I have dry skin. I have to say I'm glad that these products are relatively cheap and actually work because there is no way I'm gonna gamble 40 or more dollars on an anti-wrinkle cream that may or may not work."
3,it's a okay item.,"I used this item, wasn't impress, I know no product is going to remove wrinkles, but didn't notice any difference on my skin.I am better off for the price, to buy the cheaper product that I have been purchasing from my local CVS. I do have to say in their behave, they ship fast."
3,Face Cream,"The consistency and smell is good.I have never used this before, so it is too soon to know how well it works.It arrived on time and in good condition."
3,Not impressed,This cream was okay. I did not too much care for the feel of it. I did not see any noticeable results as far as wrinkles go.
4,Strong smell,"I love Dermae products, but this cream has a strong perfume scent. If you have a sensitive nose, I'd steer clear of this cream and try Derame Vitamin E 12,000 IU which has next to no scent. The scent of this cream is not a deal breaker for me."
2,too sticky and smelly,"this one i guess is the cheaper version of derma e products. it is got too much fragrance, and is very sticky, they have some better products to offer"
4,Good natural moisturizer,"I'm always on the look out for products that don't contain parabens and sulfates that won't break the bank. This fits the bill beautifully. It is quite lightweight, which is perfect for my skin, but someone with very dry skin might find it isn't creamy enough for them. I have been using it for quite awhile now (on my third jar) and my sensitive skin hasn't broken out or had any adverse reactions. Will definitely keep using :-)"
1,paraben replaced by Phenoxyethanol--- still toxic,"i do my research before buying creams I apply to my skin and if I can I like to educate and inform other people too. So, here is the info I found. I'm won't buy it now,Phenoxyethanol-Repeated exposure to the substance over prolonged periods has been linked to contact dermatitis (more info 1 and 2), worsening of eczema (more info), reproductive toxicity (more info) and neurotoxicity (more info 1 and 2). [...]"
4,"Good in a lot of ways, bad in a few..","I use this mask every time i go hunting and so far it has been great.. It keeps my face warm and breeze free, it is easy to see through, and allows me to wear my hat on with it.. The bad thing is that it is hard to hear the small things that a lot of hunters listen for.. and also when wearing it makes some noise when you turn your head so if a deer is close enough (like he will be in bow season) then he can hear the small sound it makes rubbing on your jacket or coveralls.. overall it is a great item that i wouldn't trade.. but could use some improvement."
2,Need to update picture,"Product shipped is different than pictured. I have a leg adapter kit as seen in the photo and prefer it over the newer design. I just think with a little bit of effort, American Hunter could update the photo."
5,Male Thinking,"This is an excellent book which explains how men think. It describes in detail the problems my male friends complain about. Since the time I finished reading the book, I have loaned it to the wife of my best friend and the wife of my next door neighbor. Both women have read it and have said it helped them deal with their husbands. I highly recommend this book to any married woman who wants to improve her marriage."
2,"Nice torso, weird sleeves","So the shirt fits great around my chest and torso, but the sleeves are just really weird. If I knew how to sew, I would take in a few inches of fabric so it doesn't look like my shoulders are trying to sprout wings. Not saying that I have toothpick biceps, but I'm not Stone Cold Steve Austin either. Just a little too baggy in the sleeves.The material is pretty thin too, so don't expect to be crawling through brush or thorny environments..."
3,Not typical t-shirt cloth,"This material is stiff and has very little stretch to it. It is not a typical knit cotton t-shirt material. The hand is harsh, and because it doesn't stretch and is cut straight down it doesn't accommodate a woman's curves -- so all the extra length just bunches up above the hips. The material is also very thin; you can see your hand under the shirt, although it isn't see through. Probably wouldn't have bought it if I had encountered it in a store."
4,Good for light duty,"I needed to buy a cymbal bag that can be folded and put inside a suitcase. The more expensive bags have a reinforced bottom and can't be folded over. This bag is good if you only have a few cymbals to carry. But be careful not to overfill it as the zipper breaks easily. There is no padding, so it is just a protective cover. Just light duty going from the house to a gig, but not for longer trips or checking at an airport."
4,Extra bag,"this is my second cymbal bag i have and the only reason i have it is for an extra cymbal bag so i have a place to put the cymbals that i dont take with me. My 20"" ride BARELY fits inside it. There aren't any extra pockets or compartments and no dividers inside it. The handle is pretty sturdy. The bag is thin so it doesn't take up any space. i love it for an EXTRA bag."
1,Broan,"This was a POS, suggest you don't bother, noisy, flimsy, and ten more adjectives of like sort, sort, sort, sort."
2,Wow this thing is loud!,"It works on exhaust for sure. These are really really loud. I have two of these and regret the day I bought them. Each time I run them, I run them as short of a period of time as I can. The noise in a short period of time causes headaches and distracts you from anything else you are trying to accomplish.Heat function is decent. The installation was a snap and very easy to install. Not sure what I am going to get to replace them, but they are getting replaced for sure."
3,Broan 655,"Broan 655 Heat-fan-light was an excellent fan for the price. The exhaust fan does very well for our 70 sq ft bath and the heater only needs to run for a short time to warm up that area. The fan noise is more than I expected but at less than 1/2 the price of the ""QT"" models its nothing I cant live with. It has 100 watt equivalent fluorescent bulb in it now and it fit where in other models it would have been to big around. Its a good choice for an economical model"
1,Extremely loud,"This fan is extremely loud. In heating mode is even louder. The fan blade must be out of balance, because when running it creates vibrations felt one floor above. I made same mistake again buying this brand fan when remodeling older bathroom. The other Broan/Nutone (same company) runs exactly same: very loud with vibrations. Cheap small fan blade spinning very fast inside. If you can spend more money, go with Panasonic. I purchased 6 fans in different sizes for new house and they all run perfect, almost hard to hear when running. Panasonic uses very large turbine spinning much slower, perfectly balanced, very quiet, no vibrations."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased two of these fans/heaters at the same time before remodeling bathrooms in my home. They sat as the bathrooms were remodeled. Both fans have been in use for less than 6 months and both of the heaters have failed. I tried replacing the coil on on one heaters without success. They do come with a one year warranty but I doubt that many make it much longer. Do yourself a favor, purchase something else."
4,Broan 655 Heater and Heater Bath Fan with Light Combination,"Broan 655 Heater and Heater Bath Fan with Light Combination - good for the price, louder than I expected, overall a good value"
3,Works. Does not include switch.,"I don't know why I expected a heater, fan, light to come with a switch. Stupid I guess.Actually, I forgot I bought it at Amazon. I returned it to Lowe's and they took it and exchanged it for the one I needed. Lowe's it great aren't they?"
5,bathroom fan,we were remodeling our bathroom and needed a new ceiling fan and the price online was alot cheaper than in the stores
3,Can you hear meNow,Very LOUD cannot hear myself sing LOL Seriously thoughPretty good value but you give up quiet moments as it is Noisy as all get out
3,Jet Engine Sound,"I purchased this product to replace the one that was installed in my house 12 years ago when we first moved in. I thought this would work just like the one we had - but no. It was fine when first installed, then about one month later when you turned it on it sounded like a jet airliner landing in the bathroom. I turned it off - tried to make sure nothing was hitting anything. The elctrician thinks it is a bad bearing - but after 10 - 15 minutes it quiets down a bit, but nothing like the one we used to have in the house. It the process of trying to replace the motor if that is even possible so I don't have to purchase a new unit. Not sure as there is no warrentee on the product.Oh well next time I guess I will purchase the next step up and hope for the best."
1,sounds like a freight train,"I replaced the identical unit I had for 22 years so I know how the last one was,It lasted over 20 yearsThe sound was manageableThe heater cranked out some heat.The new unit is noisy, you can feel the vibrations on the first and second floors.I get minimal amount of heatAs far as sones go this must be a 10The light works like a light, pretty hard to mess up a basic light fixture"
1,Never order from this place.,"I ordered this from this place on Nov. 26th 2011, I was just informed my order will not be shipped until December 7th, so it takes 11 days to ship, the order said it would ship in 3 to 5 days.Never do business with these people, I am also surprised that Amazon.com will allow these people to do business on their website, but I guess a sale and a percentage of that is worth it.I doubt if I order anything more from Amazon.com, I have been a member here 15 years and making orders at least 2 to 4 times a month."
5,better than the original,"Like it even better than the original Broan heater and bath fan with light combination it is replacing in my bathrooms. Received in a timely manner, packed securely - Happy with the purchase."
1,"BROAN ""SUPER HEAT SWITCH FAULTY""","I maintain an all electric 55 plus residential that has installed ((all Broan heated bath fans)). over 200 units locally and thousands nation wide.My comment is negative of the bath fan because Ive had several burn the grill cover (scare's the heck out of the elders).Here's what occurs the heater fan after the 5 year mark ""slows"" allowing the coils to superheat.Luckily Broan has installed a solder type superheat switch which pops the coils off way to late, severe damage grill and chard grills occur.Im going to contact Broan on this matter since we have thousands of its units on our property's.And we have had fire department calls from excited elders because of the Broan heat fan.Until we get adjustment for these units I recommend disassemble every 6 months full fan dusting and mineral oil lightly each motor.Broan has a lot to learn from Cadet heaters! Specially the superheat switch!The fan has a 5 year warranty and it lasts a full 5 ""but"" whats your house worth!"
1,oomph!,"i am still using this product, however i am so displeased with the way it functions. it is sooo noisy! you cannot have a pleasurable bathroom activity with all the noise the machine makes. i like the warm air sent out by the machine, but the noise is really upsetting. i wish that i had not gotten it, but i need the heat so i turn it on and shut the door let the room warm up then go in and cut off the machine then have a pleasant sit.../ if there where a way to exchange it for a quieter one i certainly would. i would not recommend this machine for anyone!"
3,used to replace same unit,"I purchased this unit to replace one like it. The old one I had was 20 years old and both fans were not working and lens was cracked. It is a bit noisey, but saved me from having to retro-fit a different unit."
2,Noisy,This is a very noisy unit. I replaced an existing Broan unit with this one. The older unit was not nearly as noisy as the new unit. Quality control has really slipped at the company which makes Broan products.
2,Replacing after 15 months,"The heating fan quit working after 15 months of use. Yes, the unit's a bit noisy, but I'm going to try it again. I can handle the noise and I'm going to chalk the first one up as buying a lemon. If the next one goes out early again, I'll buy a different brand."
5,Passed exam using this book,I passed 70-217 today using this book. I scored an 800 and something. This book did a great job of covering the material that MS tests about.
4,Chad Gadya? Who knows one? Who knows 175 recipes!,"Each year, thousands of readers of The New York Times await a Wednesday ""Dining In / Dining Out (DiDo)"" section that appears in the week or so preceding the Jewish holiday of Passover. They want to read about time-honored / traditional and updated / newer holiday recipes that give one a taste of the holiday, conform to dietary rules, and provide a aura of rebirth and freedom. Linda Amster, a DiDo section regular, has compiled the most exciting recipes in this Passover Cookbook; sure to become a classic. Had she only included Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles seder recipes... ""Dayenu,"" it would have been enough. Had she only then added Paul Prudhommes Pesach veal roast... ""Dayenu,"" that too would have been enough to make this worthwhile. And what about Anne Rosenzweig recipe for haroseth? ""Dayenu."" We get 175 recipes. They are all in this book. I doubt that I will ever prepare a tenth of the recipes in the book, yet it is an exciting read none the less."
4,Very good,I really liked the book. My friends raved about the Sweet and Sour Beets recipe. My only suggestion for improvement would be to give specific instructions for the Sedar plate and suggest different menus for a Sedar.
3,Moderately Interesting,"The Jam were an ambitious group, and had tired of the retro-mod sound that made them famous (in Britain). By this point, their last LP, you can hear that Weller really wants to be writing blue-eyed soul material, and that the material is not a natural fit with the group's level of energy and aggression. So we get a taught, tightly played collection of soulful performances here. It's a decent ambitious effort but I can't say that it works especially well in very many places."
3,A disappointment!,"OK, precious and a town called malice were good or even great Jam songs but the left was such a let-down after Sound Effects. Weller somehow had lost it completely...He did not realize that the Jam's potential could have been in more direct rock instead of this...anyway compared to a lot of the rest at the time it was good but not as great as many reviewers said back then."
2,Sadly very out of date,"I agree. I bought this book with the hope that it might reflect much of the newer technology relating to astrophotography today like the Canon 350D and several other digital SLR brands but it is sadly focused on film photography which, in itself, is still a relevant medium but increasingly declining. For those who may be interested in film based photography this book offers a lot."
2,Book is outdated,"The title is misleading. 95% of this book is geared toward film photography. Less than 20 pages way in the back talk about CCD imaging. Save your money and buy a book that covers more current technology. This book does cover the basic principles of astrophotography, but any good more recent book will cover the same."
3,Delightfully Cute,"Jimmy Stewart & Barbara Hale keeps the plot moving. I really enjoyed watching it. Natalie Wood was kind of ""dorky"", but her little brother ""Tommy"" was a better actor. The overall movie is ""delightfully cute"". Barbara Hale shows her ""versatility"" for acting."
1,these clamps do not work,These clams do not work at all. Do not waste your money. I will be returning mine if they accept them.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The crimp method on this does not work. Even if after several attempts you get it evenly crimped around to stop leaks, it won't hold up over time. Spend a few extra dollars and get the screw-down type (Gilmour's works very well), or just throw out the hose."
4,Get the job done,"This is not my first purchase of a tekton item, so I knew what to expect. Something about tekton; they don't make the highest quality items, but for the most part get the job done at a crazy low price. I would compare these to anything you would buy at a harbor freight. They make some random tools that come in handy at the most inopportune times. You won't find yourself reachning for these too often, and If you do need that I recommend Wiha or Klein. All in all, these are great for the price and will get the job done, and I would ignore the 1-star review as I think he must have got a dud. To me they have a solid tip that I can't foresee rounding or breaking under normal or minimal use."
4,A great read,"Even though it's a little outdated, the ideas in this book will never get old. A man learns to stand up for his family and for himself when it's not popular. Not a gripping novel, but just a good book to crash on the couch and get lost in. I loved every minute of it."
2,Missing washer at top of band upon receipt,"The watch is a beautiful watch and has a thin sleek design. I was disappointed that once the watch was on a wrist, the pin holding the band to the watchcase began to slide out. After having it looked at it was missing a washer. I haven't gotten around to getting it fixed yet."
2,You get what you pay for,"Kenneth Cole has some strengths in the world of fashion. His cologne is great. His casual mens clothing line is also great. His watches? Not so much, at least based on this product.It feels cheap. It's light and flimsy. The date window is so small I couldn't even read it. The photo shows the face of the watch as light metallic blue. In reality, it's pretty much white. No matter, I'll never wear it.Things like watches and jewelry are important to me. I'm pretty vain and I make no excuses. I like to look good and stand out. This watch would never do that for me. If you value striking and appealing accessories, make another choice."
3,Too soft,"While the Gumabones are very appealing to dogs, they are too soft. Our 7 month old puppy was able to bite the knuckle ends off in only a few days after receiving them."
1,riddled with errors and specious parallels,"Reading other reviewers' positive words on this page, you would never know that Rose's book is riddled with errors of fact, despite her almost total dependence on secondary sources. But a discerning reader might wonder at the facile slippage between person and movement (as she does with the life and family of Theodor Herzl in her psychoanalytical outlook) or at the extrapolation of a full blown theory from interviews with a few fanatic settlers. How she manages to get Shabtai Zvi as the remote founder of her version of 'apocalyptic' Zionism (oops, messianism) is likewise unconvincing. Rose is a talented professor of English; she should stick to her last."
4,Mining The Romance of Richard Rogers,"Stacey Kent is a young, native New Yorker who now lives, and generally performs, in England: that's what might happen to an American singer who falls in love with an English saxophonist. She's jazz-oriented, mining the great American standards: in this album, principally Richard Rodgers. In others, also the Gershwins, Cole Porter. Her touch is light, conversational,transparent; her attack fluid, swinging. And she's cute, too.She and her husband, tenor sax man Jim Tomlinson wind and curl around each other's voices, bringing to mind the great romantic collaborations of Billie Holiday and Lester Young;of Astrid Gilberto and Stan Getz. Or, in more contemporary terms, John Pizzarelli and Jessica Molaskey. Liner notes on this album were written by the English Booker Prize winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro. I've been so lucky as to see Kent (and Tomlinson)in person, at New York's famed Algonquin Hotel, and it was one wonderful show. Fine, mellow, and romantic, too."
4,"Sweet taste in performance, tart taste in material","After only recently discovering Stacey Kent, I have become a huge fan of her clear voice and smooth but playful performance. This disk is done well but has a bit too much sleepy material. One of the better tracks is the unusual and now corny "" I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"". ""This Can't be Love"" is great and probably the best of the disk as I prefer more up tempo music.But to be honest Stacey could be singing TV comercials and it would make an enjoyable disk."
3,A lIttle Too Sleepy for Me,"For me, Stacey Kent and her band rank high for some wonderful music, but this CD is not her best. In my opinion, it doesn't have enough energy. Out of 13 cuts, I really like three: an, interesting, bossa nova version of ""It Might as Well be Spring""; a smokin', swinging ""This Can't Be Love"" that leaves me wanting five or six more just like it; and an intriguing ""Bali Ha'i"" that makes me wonder why this Broadway gem does not show up in more jazz sets. The other ten songs, boy, I just can't keep my eyes (or ears) open anymore by the time we hit ""Thou Swell"" (cut No. 6). But...Stacey is still a favorite and her band is still one of the best I've heard. If your looking for a little more heat, I recommend you try the two fine CDs ""Let Yourself Go"" and ""Tender Trap."" If you're looking for music to go with that candlelight dinner, this could be the one you want."
4,Nice and sentimental,"This is a nice, swing oriented album;Stacey Kent is a vocalist of pleasant voice and great precision, although not all the supporting musicians drive her the way many older giants could(Sir Charles Thompson, Jess Stacy, Milt Hinton, George Duvivier... and I'm not even mentioning the best...).Could you even imagine what would Roy Eldridge or Buck Clayton do to uplift the session?Kent's husband Jim Tomlinson is definitely the best of the supporting crew, at times really passionate in his elegance so, with first-rate material, this is still a very pleasant album."
1,New York Restaurant,I would'nt recommend this book to anyone. They claim to have real restaurant critics write the reviews but have they ever been to the restaurant? Buyer beware! I'll stay with Zagat.
4,"A thoughtful, gentle comedy","One video reviewer listed this as a ""very minor comedy..."" How sad that small, gentle and subtle movies such as this are so easiy dismissed. This movie has a charm and wit which is sadly lacking in the larger, blockbuster movies. Tom Conti and Helen Mirren know just how to play their characters who are complex, intelligent and confused. Their ability to show love for their profession as teachers and for their charming Scottish school children is beautifully understated. I loved this movie and I have watched it over and over."
1,defective disks,"Of the five disks that I have tryed to formate 3 were defective. This may have just been a bad batch, but on the basis of this experince I can only say I found the product to be a disapointment."
4,Forget the jewel cases,"I ordered two packages of these on different occasions. From a functional standpoint, they work great with Nero's InCD. The problem is that both times, every jewel case in the package was cracked. Not a big deal for me, because I do not use the jewel cases, but thought I should let everyone know."
5,Wonderful stories for young and old,"I never read the Raggedy Ann stories as a child, so when my daughter went to a Raggedy Ann birthday party recently, I was curious! We have been reading the stories together, and they are beautifully written with great lessons. I love the kindness shown by Raggedy Ann and her friends. It's the kind of character I hope my daughter has herself when she grows up."
2,Mindless Entertainment... Hardly Factual,"THIS IS DEFINITIVELY NOT THE TRUE STORY OF THE POSESSION THAT ""THE EXORCIST"" IS BASED ON! It is horribly researched and drastically sensationalized to say the absolute least. It does not even give the proper location of the events. It took me only an hour or two of internet research to debunk nearly 3/4 of the movie. Do not buy this movie if you want the facts of this case, but instead buy it if you are looking for a cheesy ""Exorcist"" ""mock-umentary"" for momentary chills. If you do watch this, do legitimate journalism a favor and don't spread the rumors that this is the true story of ""The Exorcist"". If you want the truth, just look for it yourself. It's out there, but it's definitely not on this video"
4,Reasonably good,"I have the VHS and most of the facts are correct, as far as I can tell. It isn't supposed to be a ""sensationalized"" effort. In fact, from all I have seen of the video, it's presented in a very matter-of-fact way.They're not looking to make ""believers"" out of people, but present what happened along with a critique from both sides of the issue.Granted, I wouldn't be watching this for the same purpose as I would the Exorcist. The Exorcist was meant to scare the bejeezers out of you, and this seems to be designed to inform. All in all, well worth the money they charge."
4,An informational thriller,"Being a HUGE fan of the Exorcist I just had to buy this video. It gave me a lot of understanding on where Blatty got his ideas for the book. It is in now way the movie itself, it is a documentary on the story behined the famous horror film. I actually found it scarier but that's probably because I have seen the movie so many times it has lost effect. Both of them are great!!!!"
4,"A well made and narrated documentary, informative and eerie!","For years I've read that the ""Exorcist"" was based on a true story. I was happy to see a documentary of the actual events finally made. In addition to the excellent production values, the story was well told. The sincerity of the witnesses that participated in the exorcism came through in a clear and powerful fashion."
3,"an interesting, if hardly objective veiwing","i have long been awaiting the actual story to the original events of the 'pocession' which inspired blatty's classic film. while the film is indeed an enjoyable watch, you always get the feeling that it is not a true documentary as it seems to put cheesy entertainment ahead of objective facts, which is what i wanted to get out of the film(if i had wanted to see a load of exaggerated half truths i would have just watched the exorcist again.). but don't let me put you off as it is still very interseting and i have only seen the video, i am very interested to see what the dvd release offers(offical documents etc...)."
5,Great baby shower gift,"If you're tired of giving tiny clothing at baby showers, give a new mom something she'll be thanking you for two or more years down the road. I had this version for both of my sons (eldest is now 6) and keep one in the car for the 2-year-old and a spare to travel with. This has it all over the ones built into the pretty, dry-clean-only diaper bags, believe me!It is padded nicely, wipes clean easily, you can fit all but the largest size diapers in the mesh pockets designed to carry them (2 fit nicely; 3 will work with up to size 4). You can fit any brand of wipes in the plastic carrying case. Yes, not many but that would make the whole package too bulky.I can't recommend it more highly. I'm buying more today for the new babies coming this year."
4,Good product....but,"I like this a lot, and for the price it was just what I was looking for. However, it is significantly smaller than what I thought it would be. So much so, that I will most likely need to buy a larger one after a few months. Otherwise, it's perfect. I especially like the compartments for diapers and the plastic case for wipes."
3,pretty decent product but needs improvement,"this is a convenient thing to have as you can lie your baby on this diaper kit and change him. the big issue with this is that it holds only 1 or 2 diapers and some wipes. otherwise, the entire bag gets too thick and you can't fold the bag like the way it is shown in the page. i think the product has good intention but it needs improvement."
4,"A very useful product, with 1 caveat.","You'll need this, for the diaper changes. Safely place the diaper, then the baby fold, hold and tuck. Great product, nice quality of material. Has storage place for few diapers and wipes (wipes are inside a supplied plastic container) and very, very useful while travelling. Only caveat, as the material is synthetic on top, in cold climate - placing the baby on it, welllll he/she might not like it! Could have had a cloth cover on top."
2,Not bad but there are better options,"I was looking for a second diaper kit that would mostly be used in my gym bag and in the hiking baby backpack. This seemed perfect but in reality once you fill it it doesn't fold up nice and neatly like in the picture, in fact the velcro closure hardly reaches. Maybe if you were only bringing one diaper... Our SkipHop Diaper Kit is far superior in terms of design. It has all the same parts including the wipe case but once you fill it the kit still closes! And I can fit 6 size 0-3 diapers and probably 3-4 diapers in size 4 or larger. I wasn't real excited about spending 2x as much on a second SkipHop kit but I think it will be worth it."
4,Very Useful!,"I love the diapering kit, it is convenient to have everything in one place. I love it most for when I just need to change the baby real quick at a store or during dinner and I can just take it out of my diaper bag. The only thing I wish was different is that the velcro strap could be a bit longer to use as a wristlet."
1,disappointed,The blue dial is really a lot closer to black. Not as attractive as the picture online. I returned it.
1,The watch was no good,As you know I purchased this watch from WRD in Miami and I returned to the seler bicause the watch wos no good.
4,Great Sandal,I just love this sandal!! Its comfortable and love it that it comes in different colors I got the all versatile Black!! Use it with anything.
4,"Great collection of Songs, but . ..","I bought this cd and Rubio's Top Hits at the same time. Good collection of songs, but when I noticed that the songs on the two cds sounded very similar, I was confused. I looked closer at the situation and found that both cds contain almost identical songs, though in a different order. La Historia and Top Hits both have the same 12 songs. Top hits has two extra songs and La Historia has four extra songs. The singer is good, and I recommend sampling her work. Best/Greatest hits collections are good ways to sample a singer's work, but you need to be careful. I recommend this cd over Top Hits."
1,"Expensive, easily lost and destroyed","I understand Nylabone says this is not a ""Chew Toy"" however just with our dog retrieving the product it was almost completely destroyed within a day. You're better off just buying a cheap frisbee at a toy store. Also the clear design makes the product very difficult to locate. I would not recommend this product."
3,it was good,This song was good but it took some of the emotion out of the original song and made it sound more like one of the songs you here when you go into and abercrombie but the song is good (dont buy the remix's thought they are just lareger versions of this song)
3,Something to be desired,"As much as I love Idina Menzel, and as much as I LOVE Wicked, I'm a little disappointed in this. I like the Funky Junction/Anthony Reale and the Josh Harris Vocal Club mix (as I am a dance music fan to the max), but the other mixes didn't fit the vocals as well. And honestly, the single version leaves a lot to be desired when compared to the original track from the musical. Idina's voice rocks, but this CD falls a little flat. If you can't get it for free, don't bother buying it."
3,Defy Gravity,"She does not get as much attention as she should. She Idina should be just as popular as Kristin Cheneweth. Some of the songs aren't so great, but her voice never faulters. Better than I had imagined it would be."
4,Wicked goes dance!,When I read the other reviews about this CD single I was a bit worried. No need to be: I love the musical Wicked and I love this CD just as much!!! Who couldn't like Idina? I like how it can easely appeal to younger audiences having the modern dance sound....who knows they may even be dancing to it in night clubs. I deffinately suggest this CD to any Wicked/Idina fan.
5,Run Don't Walk To Purchase This CD,I had heard this on the web and had to purchase it. Let me just say that even if you don't know about WICKED or haven't heard Idina sing Defying Gravity you are in for a treat. Idina Menzel is one of the best singers out there today. She was fabulous in Wicked and in Rent. This CD has 6 versions of Defying Gravity. It has dance versions as well as her singing a regular version of the song. It is well worth the money spent. After you have heard this purchase her other CD's. You will never be disappointed.
1,Defying nothing,"I am such a fan of Wicked, and Defying Gravity is by far one of my all-time favorite songs. But the CD singles - ugh. Apparently, what makes Defying Gravity such a captivating and enchanting song is the character from Wicked. The CD singles, with it's pop/hip hop versions has NONE of the charm of the stage version. Spare yourselves the heartache and stick with the Broadway CD."
3,Don't fear questions,"The author contends that we must use questions as a way to learn, and we must not fear questions that come to us. If we really seek to make the best possible decisions given time constraints and lack of information, then we must use questions to discern the reality of a key issue. Furthermore, we must ask questions in a non-threatening manner. For those on the receiving end of a question, stop becoming defensive is another key message from the author. There is one aspect of the book that is not correct: don't ask ""why"" questions as the author promotes. Rather, one should ask for additional information: ""help me understand what happened when..., please clarify what is meant by..., etc."" When we ask ""why"" questions, we immediately prompt defensive behaviors. Questions are critical to understanding, and this author provides some valuable tips on asking questions, except for the use of ""why"" questions."
3,LEading with Questions,The concept is excellent. Necessary for anyone in management. The book itself moves slowly and can be repetetive though. Can skip chapters 1 & 2 if you are already sold on the effectiveness of the product and want to jump right into the meat of the concept.
3,Decent Book,"The author provided several examples of leaders that made changes to their organizations by using effective questions. While it is a decent book to read if you have not been exposed to this type of leadership, the book's message did get redundant."
3,Very disappointing.,"I heard ""Tears Came Falling"" and decided to buy the CD before listening to the other tracks. In the long run, ""Tears Came Falling"" is the only song I really like. You might be better buying the single track from an online music store instead of buying the whole CD."
4,PRISONERS DILEMMA ROCK,"the guitarist is from long beach, and this band rocks, but i heard their demo, havent picked up the CD yet, but get the damn CD"
4,Not as good as the first.,"I enjoyed the first Yummers a little more, this one was fun too, Emily gets into a world of trouble, lets see if she can eat her way out of this one."
4,An Yummy Yummy Book,"Fly your imagination and feed your spirit with Emily Pig, Eugene turtle and the other cool animals."
4,Convenient packaging,The Jet-Puffed marshmallow creme is a superb product for use in making fudge. I've been using it for many years. This year I decided to get it (and other baking needs) from Amazon.com because of the bulk packing and for the lower prices than my local grocer. Much more convenient to have bulk items delivered to my home than having to carry many bags home from the store.
1,fried in 2 years,Used for 2 years in garage during winter months and it burnt out the motor in the beginning of the third year. Besides being very noisy it didn't heat all that well without being turned on all the time so the electric bill went way up.
4,Like the 10 and 5 minute warning,I bought this to replace a timer that I purchased many years ago that finally died. I had a hard time finding one with a 10 and 5 minute warning and this one has that. Sometimes I get involved with other things and lose track of time. Having the 10 minute warning reminds to finish the preparations that need to be done just before serving. The only complaint I have is that it is not as loud as my old one so if I am in another room I may not hear it.
3,No surgery for me,"This came highly recommended by a friend. It saved her from much pain and from despondent caregivers. So I went to this title with high expectations.I found the information outdated and lacking much real information on how to avoid hysterectomies. It was, however, very useful in preparing to speak to a surgeon with no bedside manner. I wish I had read it before I paid $ 200+ for 10 minute consultation with a surgeon.I expected the book to give me dietary guides, speak to estrogen dominance, and how to handle that, recommend other treatments to alleviate pain. It did very little dietary guidelines and addressed none of the other issues. So, as long as you know that all you will get is an education of the lingo of surgeons, and a description of the procedures, this is a good book to get yourself educated.But if you seek real tools to keep yourself off the operating table, this is not the book for you."
2,Dr. Hufnagel lost her liscence to practive medicine,"Book is OK, but more importantly, Dr. Hufnagel had her liscence to practice medicine taken away in the state of California. I wish I knew that before ordering it. There are other books out there that are better."
5,Niv Ministry Pew Bible,"The Niv Ministry Pew Bible has been a great choice for our congregation to use in worship. It is well made and has a great type size for many readers. I believe that many people could use this Bible daily as their regular devotional Bible. I am certainly considering using it this way due to its handy size, good type, and durable binding. If you are looking for a functional no frills Niv Bible, this is great choice. Thumbs up for the Ministry Pew Bible !!! Pastor Jim"
3,Fossil Watch-Heavier than expected but attractive,The watch is thicker and heavier than I expected; great for a bigger guy ... odd that it comes in a tin with 60's-ish flowers on it. Great looking watch though.
4,"useful item, not as useful as the victorinox version","smaller than the other version, it is a bit too small. scissors are great.one had a clip that was too loose- could not hold $ not good for a money clip."
1,junk,"See the shoulder strap in the picture? yeah, it's attached at the top and the bottom. So that means about 3' is dragging on the ground. It only has one opening at the top so it is not practical to hold other practice weapons like bokkens or hanbos since you would have to reach over 3' to get to them. Find a reputable supplier and pay a bit more for quality. Fabric, not pleather. Make sure it has a zipper and not velcro. Make sure you can access smaller weapons if you use them."
3,easy to prepare,"After opening package I was a little disappointed at how small it was. However, it was a great project to involve my grandson in as no oven was involved. It was very easy to prepare. Once taking my first few bites and tasting its richness, I realized there was plenty."
5,Diva Continues to Reign....,"Absolutely wonderful. Ms. Fernandez has always had such an enchanting voice. Her ability to touch her audience either live or through recording is absolutely captivating. I loved her in the movie Diva, I love her still! This CD is a must have for those who are a fan. Treat yourself...it's worth it! :)"
2,Quality suffers,"This is an interesting compilation. A bit disjointed in timeline, but interesting slant on history if you watch the propaganda films. One film went so far as to suggest the Army Air Corp won the battle of Midway, rather than the Navy. Unfortunately most of the unique and never before seen material is of such poor quality, it detracts from it's content."
3,Incomplete History of Air Combat,"This DVD set is interesting because of the rare footage that has been compiled from official sources from the U.S Air Force, Army, and Navy, but there in lies the critical flaw. The episode Vietnam and The Limits of Air Power (a title probably assigned by the author)is actually an official U.S Air Force documentary from the Vietnam War that says nothing of the kind about airpower's limitations. Quite the contrary, it actually brags about how effective U.S airpower was during Operation Rolling Thunder, something any modern historian or even a pilot at the time would laugh at. The set does not include, however, a documentary about the Linebacker operations that really hit the North Vietnamese where it hurt. The set also as you would expect reading the first sentence of this paragraph, only covers U.S air wars and operations. This makes the title very misleading. The author's long monologues before each episode are another detractor."
1,Unscientific and shallow,"I came across this book in a public library, and I was not impressed by the shallowness and plain error of Beckwith's work on foetal ""pain"" and his disdain for the science of embryology. How can something be logical if it is littered with erroneous and sparse scientific errors"
1,"Science, Research Design and Empirical Truth","If the anti-abortion movement can only appeal to self-referential epistemologies without substantive empirical content for its propositions, then it cannot expect to shape public policy outcomes. It cannot expect to win a debate on conservative Christian Aristotlean- Neoplatonist criteria alone when its axioms can be empirically refuted. Professor Beckwith has written an excellent neo-Aristotlean applied work, but it is his epistemology that is defective here"
1,Beckwith's Authorial Comment Aristotelian,"I must protest at Francis Beckwith's use of the slavery analogy to corroborate his anti-abortion position.I would suggest that he rereads Dred Scott v Sanford (1854)as that case is specifically about the citizenship of slaves, not their biological personhood. Unfortunately, this is a typical example of Aristotelian analogical reasoning that relies on resemblances and similarities based on surface attributes that fall apart on closer investigation..."
1,Bounded Rationality Impresses No-One,"As a male medical student, I contend that Beckwith's work is factually incorrect. I'm sure that his self-referential Aristotlean and bounded logic convinces anti-abortionists and the naive undecided who are unfamiliar with anti-abortionist a priori premises and manipulation of the debate, but it does not impress rigorously critical sources of opinion. Beckwith's argument is bounded rationality and logic, and is not proper rigorous Socratic dialogue"
1,"No axe to grind, but...","The abortion-rights respondents are right. Francis Beckwith does use skewed and a priori reasoning, and from what I've read about Aristotle, the anti-abortion position is heavily based on that series of prescientific propositions"
1,"Deontological ""Logic"" Versus Substantive Factual Detail","Beckwith's defence of his stance is based on a premodern, Aristotlean ""natural law"" a priori ethics, theory of essences, teleology, and not on proper Socratic dialogue, which rigorously examines both sides of a claim."
1,Encapsulated Discourse and the Abortion Debate,"Beckwith's work is no more different from earlier attempts to do so, and just as flawed due to its absence of accurate scientific detail"
1,Medically Challenged and Misleading,"Anti-abortionists continue to laud this book as a notable contribution to the abortion debate, although its presuppositions are based on data that destroys the a priori Aristotlean logic of its basis. It is not ""politically correct"" to argue that below twenty-eight weeks of gestation, foetuses and embryos cannot feel pain, it is medical fact, from the American College of Obsteitricians and Gynaecologists. Similar problems beset anti-abortion ""research"" on postabortion syndrome,and other elements of a priori anti-abortion reasoning. Despite ad hominem attacks, this work may be coherently organised, but it fails to impress objective readers."
4,Needs supplementation,"This type of book really needs to be supplemented with works like Pro-Life Feminism: Different Voices, Prolife Feminism Yesterday and Today, and Matthewes-Green's latest on Real Choices.For a few decades now, some so-called ""feminists"" have promoted the idea that legal abortion is necessary to the emancipation of women--even more important, some claim, than the right to vote. But real feminists, in the classic feminist tradition of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Alice Paul, recognize that abortion actually perpetuates the marginalization, exploitation, and abuse of women. Want to learn how? Read these supplemental books!"
4,Encyclopedic in its analysis of the abortion debate.,"I have referrenced this book many times over the years. It is user friendly for the individual looking for analyses of the many facets of the politically, and inappropriately gender charged debate over the issues of choice as they intersect with the issues of life. I cannot recommend this book enough to those who are genuinely interested in the many facets of this debate. As in many so-called gray areas of life, if one is willing to reason through the issues at hand and follow Truth where ever it may lead the proper choice becomes obvious. Beckwith provokes reasoned thought in such a way as to leave us with an unambiguous CHOICE"
5,Best Book on Abortion,"This must be the best book ever written on the abortion debate. Professor Beckwith systematically demolishes every single argument used by the ""pro-choice"" crowd to rationalise the killing of children before they are born."
5,Best book about abortion?,"This is the most reasoned book I know on the issue of abortion and it is natural sciences, ethics, some cases of law and even Biblical theology, etc. All of this with a perfect, flawless logic. Impressive, congratulations for this achievement!"
1,Sorely Disappointed,"When I got my ""new"" case, I got a filthy, used, junked out piece of crap. When I called to ask what was going on they asked me to read something off the box. I asked ""I was supposed to get a box?"". I saw the product at Costco and it seemed great! But when I ordered it from here I got used junk. I say get it, but don't get it here."
3,Good idea...needs more thought.,"This bag serves its purpose, it holds my notebook, it keeps it from burning my legs, and i can store my cords and what not in it. BUT, and this is a big one...the FIRST day that I got it the zipper was giving me trouble. It would snag on the fabric making it impossible to zip all the way without it either breaking the zipper open or making it impossible to unzip again. It was a big disappointment. And no, my notebook isn't too big for it. So now its impossible to close all the way because the zipper will snag on the snagged fabric."
3,A Poorly-Implemented Nice Design,"With one of these, you can keep your laptop on your lap without worrying about the side effects on your future progeny. Unfortunately, Belkin chose to implement this nice looking design with somewhat cheap fabric that seems to easily collect dirt. The lining dividing the main compartment from the cavernous side pocket could have used some padding. As it is, I am somewhat reluctant to put my bulky power supply into it. The green bag is also considerably brighter in reality than in the pictures."
1,Don't waste your money,"Zipper broke the second time I used it and came completely off shortly after. My 15.4"" widescreen did NOT fit well inside the case, and when it was in there, there was hardly any room for my peripherals. Don't waste your money on something that will not work/cease working within a couple weeks."
4,Perfectly correlates with the workbook.,"Pairs great with the student book! I love that you learn about God right along with writing, and get to share God's Word with others!"
4,A great work,"I really really liked this book. It was relatively aimed at Wiccans and Pagans, but it had very nice information, both of a spiritual nature, and scientifically so, about all sorts of herbs, flowers, and trees. Some of the exercises seemed a little weird to me, but to each his own- someone might really benefit from these. I see the outdoors as an even more beautiful place after reading this book. Its definately worth buying!"
3,Wonders of Nature,"This book tells us about the wonders of nature, animals and the hidden spirit worlds. Two great exercises for calming your mind and body, information for nature gifts are here for you. Guided meditations and nature visualations make this book a valuable tool to learn and grow. Ted Andrews presents nature and it's glory in a perfect way. The book has one problem-the descriptions of flowers, trees and landscapes must come from your own interpreting,from your own understanding, from your own memories, not what the author suggests. In general, very good book for wonders of nature."
1,again...many lessons,"Andrews is such an amazing observer of nature who continues to foster spiritual pathways. His works continue to be incentives for making broader circles full of potential within my daily life. This book clearly springs from a deep spiritual current. He is an amazing translator for planetary soul friends! Seeing natures gifts from his viewpoint has given me a larger picture of life to enjoy, worship, and adore. I am a better partner with my yard friends...many who are now my soul friends. Thank You again for another celebration of wonder written from a very profound perspective."
1,Nature-Speak,"This is a wonderful book! As with all of Ted Andrews' books that I've read, so many questions have been answered for me and things that didn't make sense before I now understand. Now I know why I've always wanted to live near a forest area and why I prefer my yard to be full of chicory, thistles, and iron weed (what other people call weeds). I'm starting to understand the messages that they have for me. I recommend this book to anyone who feels they want to get intune with their natural surroundings."
1,Incomplete and very fast typing,"A definite nono!This book was such a big disappointment that, along with Animal Speak, I actually threw it away for old paper recycling after only reading 2 chapters...I am a fervant reader of books that shamans have written over the years, and have done many shaman rituals and received teachings from shamans, but have never read such shaman pretents' as Ted Andrews' scribblings.Incomplete, unresearched, only desktop type of research including a big splash of thumbsucking ideas and lateral associations produced this booklet and I donot recommend this to anybody, who is looking for indepth and authentic knowledge on the Animal and Nature World.By the rate this author spits out books and other materials, it cannot be anything else than making a fast buck on half-cooked porridge type of content."
1,Looks nice at first...but fell apart after a few months.,"I liked the look of this spice rack, and I agree that it does safe counter space. Everything about this rack was fine up until I picked it up by the handle to move it and clean the area. The handle is held on by 2 plastic screws, both broke. This rack really isn't heavy, and they put a handle I assume so that you can pick it up and move it but don't do it. For $50, you would think they could have splurged for metal screws. Disappointed."
5,Great Spice Rack,"This spice rack looks great in a kitchen with stainless steel appliances. No complaints here, it is easy to use and easy on the eyes."
5,Very pleased with my selection,"Checked out many Spice Racks and chose this one.Fits perfertly against the wall allowing for full workspace on cabinet. Love the design, sharp looking andsolid construction. No regrets....love it! OldeThompson makes a very nice product."
4,Spice Rack,"It arrived safely, all the parts look good. It saves space and the letters are easy to read. I would like to another rack with other spices, such an Indian spice rack, a Mexican rack etc.."
2,Beautiful but not durable,I give this spice rack 2 stars because it really is as beautiful in person as it is in the pic. unfortunately I had to return it because the top of several spice jars did not snap shut and were very flimsy! Spice jars that are not airtight will be stale in no time!!! I also wanted the ability to have access to the spices I actually use so I am looking for empty refillable spice jars that are higher quality.
3,"Arrived black plastic, not stainless steel",The rack looks the same only the top and bottom are black plastic. The jars have black plastic lids. Only the frame is steel. Spices are fine. It looks disappointing. Luckily black goes with the kitchen as well as stainless. I will not order from these people again.
2,Not exactly what I was hoping for...,"The rack is fine and looks pretty good..the glass bottles also look nice... but their lids are cheap chrome painted plastic and have the spice names printed on them... I should have read the details more closely, but I was hoping to have empty bottles and fill them with my own spices and also not have preprinted labels. The spices that come with this are OK, but not as diverse as one would hope. Also - why give spices that need to be ground up in bottles without grinders...? So my 2 star review is due to the cheap pre-labeled plastic lids that don't include grinders where appropriate and also the generic collection of spices."
1,Guessing game... Which Spices will they send???? Not for me!!,"I read other reviews and chose not to buy this rack. I am not going to buy a product that will not state the spices that come with it. I am supposed to be buying spices, not playing the guessing game of what they will choose to send."
3,I wish I could relabel the jars!,"As others have said, the jars are pre-labeled. This is too bad. Several of the spices are those I will probably never use. I'm trying to think of a creative way to relabel the jars. Label maker? Paint over the lids? I want them all to look the same. It really bugs me."
5,Love it,It looks beautiful on the counter and is space saving! Spices are fresh.not sure how I can change the names of the spices on the jars!!!
3,Very good netbook racer,Bought this for my Asus Eee PC 1005 HAB and I was not disappointed.Plays GREAT with no slowdowns or other problems.I do prefer racing games with some competition but this is fine for my type of netbook.It WILL play on Win 7 as I am using Win 7 Pro.
4,Good for the Grandkids,"These are the real thing, pre-1960s, much better than the rip-offs in the bargain bins at Walmart. There are repeats from other Tom and Jerry collections, however."
2,Not as pictured,"These are not as pictured. They have red bias tape around the wrist, not brown, and the seams are black not grey/same as glove. Also the pair I ordered was damaged, and they seem very poorly made. The whole glove is thinner than any of my other work gloves, and these are lined!EDIT: I did want to mention that the seller was very accommodating about return."
5,"High quality, small size - perfect for little ones.","My daughter (3 years) loves that she has her very own knife (no serrated edge), and it is just the right size for her. It is the high quality you would expect from Oneida. I like it because it is a real fork, with real tines, not the blunt edge kids forks usually have. So, she is able to actually use the fork without much assistance. This set has cut down eating with her hands."
5,you have to see live,"The Saw Doctors are a wonderful mix of rock and celtic tradition. This album truly catches their live performance. While they will never be as polished as U2, their shows are just as entertaining, and can be described by one word FUN."
4,Lyrical and Live,"I bought the Sawdoctors Live in Galway,mainly for the lyrics and the drive,and the drive is definitely there,and what a night,but I cant really hear the lyrics which is what this band is about, other than the hellraisin good time!I cant wait to see them in Port Fairy Victoria Australia in March (or April) 2011 and hear the punchy good time sound of this band.I play the thing anyway because it lifts my spirits and anyway,I can get the words off the internet!"
3,some basic pop...& tons of ultra advanced jazz,"I bought this because I'm a big Police fan. Most any mortal would be impressed by Andy's monstrous music knowledge, but, unfortunately, on this DVD, Andy kinda downplays the Police and instead made an ultra advanced jazz clinic.PROS:* Talks about/illustrates his unorthodox approach to chords within the pop genre* Teaches the progressions to a few police hits (probably the ones he contributed to most, since we know Sting developed most of Police's core song ideas) and even plays cool live segments of them with his most recent trioCONS:* Most of the material is extremely advanced jazz and discussed as if he were talking to advanced players* Andy's guitar has no dots/fret markers, so watching him play on-screen is relatively useless (fortunately, a booklet is included)* He also has an annoying habit of monotone grunting while he plays...fine for stage, but not good for close proximity instruction"
4,If you like Andy's playing...,"You'll enjoy this video. It's like sitting down with a very gifted guitar instructor who has a deep understanding of music and is just letting it flow. In other words, keep the pause button handy. When he goes through chords he like they just keep rolling with little chance to grab one before he hit another. Of course that's what the diagrams in the booklet are for. Andy's presentation is pretty ""low key"" with that dry British sense of humor. If you enjoy that it's even more fun to learn from him."
4,A good pamphlet,"The book is really a pamphlet. I would have given it a five, except for it's not accepting the historicity of the slaughter of the innocents. Outside of this fact, this is a very concise and good account of Herod. If you are looking for an overview that will not get you bogged down in too much detail then this book is a very good buy. Worth the price and can be read cover to cover in an hour or so."
3,Not what I expected.,"I have been doing cards on and off for about a year now and this book is not what I expected it to be. I thought it would be a little easier for me to do the cards on weekends, but the cards are not too easy to do. I am little disappointed, but I'm sure that if you have more experience, this book would probably be good."
4,Trade and fiscal adjustment in africa,"This book provided a comprehensive review of making a living in Africa. It talked about the futility of coconut farms as a succesful job and talked about where in Africayou could find the best decently paying job and relatively low-cost housing. I liked this book because it was not as dense as other books about trade and fiscal adjustment in Africa I had read. It also helped persuade me not to move to Africa, an option which I had been thinking about when I quit my last job."
3,Not enough to make worth buying,"The book had two pages of useful insight. The majority of the book tends to be a list of dates and places followed by ""and then troops moved forward."""
5,STELLAR,"This is an eye opener. Why hasn't Bush told us this? After reading this book, I realize that the only person who can save the U.S. from destroying itself is Wesley K. Clark. We need him as President. VOTE CLARK 04www.clark04.comSave America."
2,Typical Military Mentality,"Full of military directions and operations, most of which are dry and uninteresting. I wanted insight, I got none. Would he make a good president based upon his writing here? No!! He is a military man through and through and thinks the solution to problems can be solved with this type of narrow thinking. I was bored with the book after the first page, and it got worse as I read on. I do not recommend buying this book."
5,This guide comes with a huge bonus !,"While I really did appreciate the very valuable and well organized information offered by the book, I was very nicely surprised to see that the book came with a Keyboard Cover. This tool is pretty amazing in the sense that, besides being very attractive, it simply eliminates the task of remembering the huge number of key shortcuts ! Brilliant addition to the book which deserves 3 1/2 stars on its own.....but together, this combination deserves 5 stars.I just don't understand why Amazon doesn't mention the inclusion of the Keyboard Cover ? It would have made my decision process much easier.Joelle"
3,Flying to Tasmania & Back,"This was indeed a great help in my flying capabilities with the Beechcraft King Air (Favourite) Has all the info on the intricate flying detail. Sure assisted my in flying from my home in Melbourne, Australia to my Mothers home in Hobart, Tasmania. Very handy to have...NB"
4,A great book - Un libro excelente,"This book is a great way to introduce any child to Espanol. With large pictures of animals, family members, household items, vehicles, shapes, colors, numbers etc. it's easy learning. As an overzealous Tia, I started reading & looking at the pictures with my nephew beginning at a little under a year old. This book has given him a good foundation and is one of his ""old"" favorites at the age of two. An added bonus is that it's a good refresher for any of us who don't use our spanish every day."
3,LIKE IT.,"It's not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo. Try this shampoo & condition - you won't be disappointed!"
3,Ehhh,"Might be a great conditioner, but I need a good trim/cut because my hair isn't healthy &I this did not make the detangling process any easier. My lottabody leave in did a better job."
3,i like it an all ...,"i like it an all but i jus didnt realize how small the bottle actually was when it arrived in the mail. came in early, so that was good, and it definitely keeps your hair soft all day. but seriously, for the price, its not bad."
2,Boring,Does nothing that other conditioners can't do. The bottle is so small and doesn't last long. It doesn't feel like its enough when I use it.
4,Pretty Happy,"Product is good. I don't have to wash my hair for two or three days after one day's treatment of Mane'n'Tail. It doesn't cure my sometimes-accumulating dandruff, but that's a tough one to tackle in general. Product came in the size I expected and is the real deal :-)"
4,Natural hair softer than ever before!,"I purchased this because i have an extremely itchy dry scalp. Even tho I have natural African American hair, I always had a problem with how thin my hair was. With first use, I realized how soft my hair was and how it brought out my natural curl alot better. I leave it on for 30-45 minutes once a week...usually as a co-wash....with a plastic cap to lock in themoisture. My hair is so soft, fuller and i just love it! I hope this helps."
1,A manes tail ? Not likely .,This product doesn't do anything but dry my hair out ! Instead of fixing my split ends it gave me more .! So disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money,"I have thick asian hair and conditioning is sometimes an issue. This conditioner unfortunately, was no miracle for me. It works no better than any standard Suave conditioner you can pick up at your local Target. Don't waste your money, you're better off making a trip to the local store for something much cheaper."
2,Made My Hair FALL OUT,"I bought this product because I saw how many good reviews it had.I am a 21 year old female with long brown hair. I was hoping this shampoo / conditioner would help me get rid of some of the dryness and frizziness. I used the products for about a week and a half washing my hair every other day and saw no improvement with my hair.The only thing I did notice was that the more I used it, the more MY HAIR FELL OUT! each time I showered, more and more of it would fall out while I was shampooing / conditioning my hair. I have used many types of shampoos and conditioners and none of them make my hair fall out the way this duo did.Never buying it again.The only reason im giving it 2 stars is because even though my hair fell out, it did do a good job of cleaning it. However did nothing to help the frizz or dryness."
4,Monte Carlo Simulation Made Easy,"I used this book to create simulations in C++, although the book's programming language is Fortran. The basics are here and the results are really good. This is useful for coding ""one off"" solutions, less so for general purpose applications, but I have used it in several practical situations with excellent results. Definitely for the ""geekier"" coders, but done in a way that you can pretty much ""cookbook"" a solution. Recommended."
2,"Ok, but not great","Worked well with the original remote for my Verizon FIOS STB, but didn't work well in either of my universal remotes. Handled the amp and DVD fairly well, but the signals to the STB were inconsistent enough that I returned the device."
2,"could be better, limited range","The unit works alright from about 25-30 feet away. I need it to reach 35-40 and it just won't do it. I wonder if the two adapters for the AA size battery gives an insufficient connection, or maybe the two watch zize batteries that power it, along with the one AA you have left just doesn't give it enough juice."
2,The prying heads are too fat,"The price is right, but the heads are more round than they should be, which makes it difficult to actually put the small end of the prying part under something you want to pry. 15 minutes on the grinder resolved. I don't like buying products that I have to fix before using."
3,fitting tribute ti hanshi steve arneil,"a information packed little number. standard openining warmups as well as basic technique found in kyokushin karate. children demonstating movements and taikyoku kataIII really emphisizes ease and simpicity of karate form. wonderful early photos of active and former celebrities in mas oyama's kyokushin kaikan karate do, shihan howard collins as a sandan and the great tadashi nakamura as a seventh dan, doing magnificent ice breaking. finally the book offers a wonderful index of dojo worldwide. osu, jts"
4,Just what I needed,I am brand new to the world of iPods. My wife bought me one. I wanted to be able to hook it up to my home stereo and to charge it without plugging it into the computer. This solved both problems and was affordable.
1,"lousy sound quality, even at $43.99","I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8"") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button."
3,Very average,"Although there were some items of amusement, for the most part, this book is rather cliche and the artwork lacks clarity. As a relative newcomer to the scene, however, this young man (I assume he is in his 20s) may have a bright future in the world of satire once he develops a unique outlook of his own and a bit more life experience from which to ""draw"" on."
4,"An excellent store of folklore, a boy and his grandad","This is a book that explores the nature of folk stores told by a grandad, that no one, not even the grandad are sure is true. It is works with the notion that many of our folklores well are they just folk stores?? Not to be outdone are the illustrations of the book. The northernlights in this book sometimes seemed to dance on the pages. The illustrations of the book are some of the best."
4,In the Gravest Extreme: The Role of the Firearm in Personal Protection,Good introductory material for the new or prospective concealed carry enthusiast. It is also a good reminder for seasoned carriers about being judicious in the transport and utilization of their weapons. Some of the information is dated but the principles remain the same.
2,Dangerously Dated,"Massad Ayoob is an excellent teacher, trainer and a pretty good writer. That's why I'm so surprised that this book hasn't been updated. Some of the material in it is so out of date that it's dangerously misleading now. Instead, pick up a copy of Jim Grover's ""Street Smarts, Firearms and Personal Security"" and Ayoob's ""The Truth About Self Protection."" Both are considerably better."
5,Must Read,"If you are a concelled carry person - this is a must read. Even though it was written several years ago, the though and reasoning included this book helps you to be prepared for concelled carry."
5,Excellent to Inform Yourself About Personal Protection,"Mr. Ayoob provides intelligent and insightful information with examples on the use of deadly force. A must read for anyone that owns or is planning to own firearms for personal defense. However, it is no substitute for learning your local laws about the use of deadly force. It could use some minor updating, but the subject matter is still as applicable today as it was in 1980."
4,In the Gravest Extreme: The Role of the Firearm in Personal Protection,"Great book. Factual, a must read for anyone even thinking of carrying a gun. It covers a multitude of info from the basics to the extreme."
5,Great cornerstone book on self defense...,"This book is the cornerstone book when it comes to a citizens personal protection with firearms. Though it is somewhat outdated, this book clearly spells out the cornerstones and building blocks to personal defense. This is an excellent book that should be in the library of any person who is serious about self defence."
5,A must read for anyone who owns a gun,"He brings out a lot of things I never thought to consider and I've been through two classes, one in South Carolina where I live and one in Utah. If you carry concealed or are thinking about it please read this book, it will save you a headache later and you will be more fully informed."
2,Skeptical,"Author attempts to illustrate complex points of law by citing unverifiable incidents and implausible acts of daring, most of which I remain skeptical of. Though I am in agreement with Ayoob philosophically in matters of self-defense, law is separate matter entirely, and one that is not adequately addressed in this short treatise. Big on bravado but short on legal-sense, Ayoob misses the mark with this one."
1,"Great Book, But WAY Overpriced on Amazon","An excellent book that covers many important aspects of concealed carry, but I bought the same book BRAND-NEW from Ayoob's own website ([...]) for $12.95."
1,Wonderful book,Very thoughtfully presented material. The responsibility of carrying a firearm is stressed as well as the opportunity to serve those around us.
3,It's basic,The first few chapters are the only good one's. After that mostly useless. Since it's cheap I gave it 3 stars
2,"History book, not practical in modern terms","The book would have been more worthwhile when it was originally published and is still interesting as a historical document. Much of the book is obsolete, predating the .40 S&W and polymer framed guns, and to some extent modern ammunition. When discussing guns for women, he doesn't promote calibers above .38 special ""Unless you're a big girl"". The sections on when you are allowed to use armed defense are decent, if a bit generic--Basically, ""in the gravest extreme"" when all other methods have failed. Out of the 130 pages, the currently useful parts could easily be distilled down to 30 pages or so."
4,Still pretty good,The content does seem a bit dated at times. I suspect that Ayoob might even feel differently about some of his statements now. I say that based on some of his more recent writings.It is a good read for individuals of any level of experience. Readers new to firearms should compare the ideas put forth in this book with ideas presented in more modern writings (including those of this author).
4,Insightful look at responsible gun ownership,"While some of the advice regarding specific firearms seems out of date, the book is very valuable for its discussion of when and how use a gun for self defense. Buying a gun on a whim and sticking it in a drawer is just not adequate or responsible. You must be both psychologically prepared to shoot someone and practiced enough to operate the weapon under extreme stress. And the time to think about the legal, moral, and even tactical issues that surround shooting another person is long before you're in a situation where it might be necessary. If you're contemplating getting a gun for protection, this book will help you determine whether that's the right decision for you. If you already have one, it will help you develop the right state of mind regarding its use in defensive situations."
5,**excellent**,"This excellent book covers *all* the important issues related to owning a handgun for self protection. I had heard that Ayoob was the definitive writer on the subject, and after reading this book I see why. The book is short enough that it can be easily read in a couple evenings, but long enough to thoroughly cover all the important issues. No matter your experience level with hand guns, this book is a must read. There is something in it for everyone. I have passed the book on to very experienced friends, they have said the same thing. The book is just *excellent*."
3,Superb... but in need of updating/revision!,"If you've just bought your first ""self-defense"" handgun, you should read this book. However, note that it was published in 1980, and hasn't been updated since... that was 22 years ago! I've read many of Mas' articles since, and attended his Lethal Force Institute Course more recently. Some of his/LFI's current recommendations are in conflict with _some_ of the info in this book. An update is overdue. Having said that, it is still a classic, and worth adding to your library. A revision/2nd Edition would rate an emphatic FOUR STAR.REO"
5,In the gravest extreme,I have read about 1/3 of the book to date. I am anxious to finish it. This should be required reading for anyone who carries or plans on carrying a hand gun. Even though Texas requires legal training in their requirements for a permit to carry it doesn't come close to the thought provoking contents of this book. Massad Ayoob knows his stuff.
2,"Out of date, little useful information","When this book was written 30 years ago, it might have served as a useful introduction to armed self-defense for the civilian. A lot has happened since then, and it goes without saying that laws regarding the use of deadly physical force, even in self-defense, can vary a lot from state to state. Ayoob is undoubtedly an expert in the field and I've always like his writing. However if this is something you're serious about, reading this book is not going to help you out that much, let alone complete your training. Familiarize yourself with your state's laws, then take a class through your local Sheriff's office."
5,"""Gravest Extreme"" Review","An excellent read for those interested in utilizing a firearm for home protection. It really gives the reader numerous things to think about and consider before, during and after protecting one's home and family with a firearm. A must read for any firearm owner!"
2,Totally Misleading,This product was misleading I thought and my 10 year old thought the figurines were bigger and did not have to be built. The motorcyle is less than and inch long and the men are about 1/4 inch big woudnt reccomend.
2,A MISLEADING STORY,IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO FAVORD THE COWBOY SIDE OF THE TOMESTONE GUN FIGHT & MAKING THE EARPS OUT AS THE BAD GUYS THIS BOOK WAS VERY ONE SIDED TOWARD THE COWBOY SIDE
4,absorbing and thought-provoking,"Paula Mitchell Marks' ""And Die in the West"" is one of the most enjoyable treatments of history that I have read in some time. Not only is her prose highly readable and informative, it also achieves that goal which every good historian must set out to do--provide an objective analysis in light of the sources available. Mrs. Marks provides a comprehensive look at the forces which helped to define the West, then provides the shootout out behind the OK Corral and its aftermath as the ultimate example of those forces in conflict. While it can be argued that a bit too much time is spent on the legal proceedings following the gunfight, it is a minor flaw in an otherwise first-rate work. Anyone looking for a thorough, detailed description of the events and characters that played a role in the mythos of the West is hereby encouraged to make this book a part of their permanent collection."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I gave this book 3 stars because I don't really buy into most of the things the author says about spirit guides. It could simply be that I prefer Allan Kardec's work. However, the (small) section in the back of the book provides exercises in communicating with your spirit guides that I have been using and they are easy to do. I would recommend this book based on that section only. It would still be worth buying it."
3,Just okay,"It was a little boring, and hard to read. I enjoyed Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls much more."
4,An introduction to spirit guides,This book is perfect for the person who is just learning about spirit guides. This book shows you how to communicate with yourself and your guide. It is easy to read and enjoyable
4,A Great Big Winner,Our 3-year-old is a big fan of the TV series and had always pretended that he also had a copy of the Great Big Book of Everything. Now he's thrilled to have his very own REAL one. He even keeps it under his bed just like Stnaley does. The book is beautifully set out and interesting to read for all ages. A great book for any child who enjoys Stanley or is into wildlife.
4,Great book!,"my 2 year old has been obsessed with Stanley and animals for a long time now. Ordered the book last week and he has yet to put it down. He eats with it, even sleeps with it. I can't even count how many times we've read it or he's gone thru it on his own. Definitely a keeper."
4,Great but not Absolutely Everything,"My three-year old son is obsessed with Stanley books and the TV series. It's the best show on television for kids. He knows a ton about all things zoological, thanks to Stanley, Dennis, Elsie and Harry. We've been waiting months for the GBBOE to come out. He's thrilled. The book is wonderful, but would be even better if it had a section were the animals are alphabetized, like in the television series, where they all sing out the letters until they get to the first letter of the animal in question. This would reinforce learning the alphabet. I also had hoped that there would be blank pages or sections where he could draw or paste in his own pictures -- again, as in the TV series, where the book is a kind of scrap book. It'd also be fun for the book to come with stick-on tabs to mark favorite pages."
3,This is not the TV version of the book!,"My daughter and neice both love to watch Stanley and so I bought this book thinking it would be set up similar to the Great Big Book of Everything on the show. I was wrong. This book is not set up alphabetically as it is on the show. It has sections for Mammals, Birds, etc. It then has sub heading such as web-footed animals, spiky animals, etc. You can't just look up P for porcupine....you must go to the mammals section and then look under spiky animals. This book is full of great pictures and lots of good information, but the layout can be confusing. While i still like the book, it is a bit disapointing."
4,It Really Is The Great Big Book Of Everything!,"My kids, ages 8 and 3, both love this book! They were so excited when the book arrived and they had their very own Great Big Book of Everything, just like from the Stanley TV show. They even sing the song every time they open it. This book is full of so much information about all kinds of animals. It's great for looking up specific information or just flipping through. We highly recommend it!"
5,Great for educational purposes!,"I think it is great that the animals are not alphabetized - make the child think and learn - teaches the child about habitats, how big they are, what they eat (herbivore, carnivore, omnivore), etc. Maybe less TV and more book would be better anyways! 5 year old son LOVES this book and has learned ""facts"" instead of just the name of the animal. We do not watch the show so I cannot compare it to that. If your child enjoys learning about animals, they will enjoy this book. If looking for a nice alphabetized picture book, this is not for your child. ENJOY!"
2,The great big book,"Love the Stanley show and the great big book of everything theme song. But the book, not so much. The book has many different stories, pictures on one page and to me, this book is just all over the place.Cyndy"
4,Awesome,"It was an excellent cd except for his song Tutti frutti. That song is the most nerve racking version ever recorded. The best is Blue Suede Shoes and I Got a Woman. Elvis was the ""BEST EVER"" recording artist and has a sensational voice."
5,The best of the best of a young rock 'n' roller!,"I played this CD over and over. The songs are great rockabilly tunes. When it was originally released in 1956, it was the first LP ever to go gold, and the first rock 'n' roll album to reach #1. It remained at #1 for ten straight weeks! The title says it all. All of you Elvis fans who do not have any early Elvis CDs, get this one now! I guarantee you'll love it."
5,"Not the original album, but just as great","This has 6 extra tracks which were recorded at the same time as the original 12, so this isn't an exact duplicate of RCA's first gold record or the first rock 'n roll album to hit #1 on the charts.As such, I consider this a landmark album along with the Sun Sessions, Memories: The '68 Comeback Special, That's The Way It Is, and 30 #1 Hits. Each of these captures a very important side of Elvis.This album is the still raw Elvis, maybe a bit more polished than during his Sun days, and more into a mixture of R&B, country, and rock than in his basically rockabilly days, although some of those are here too.Some of his best such as ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Blue Suede Shoes"", ""Tutti Frutti"", ""Shake Rattle And Roll"", ""I Got A Woman"", and ""Money Money"" are here.If you don't have any Elvis at all, I recommend Elvis 30 #1 Hits first, but follow that one up with this great CD."
5,Elvis the greatest-the sun never sets on a legend.,"Elvis the very definitive of pure rock and roll. this collection of songs demonstrate just how timeless this man is.Elvis was always a leader and a trendsetter.He is often imitated but never equalled.Take a trip down through memory lane as you listen to these great tunes and you will realize that Elvis is just as much with us today as in years gone by and he will be with us for always.Enjoy this raw,pure,natural,God given talent."
3,Hard to learn about a deck...,"... with such a tiny ""Instruction"" booklet smaller than the cards themselves and the print was so small you need a major bright light and a magnifying glass to read it... the cards are beautiful but the ""Instruction"" booklet and and actual instructions""??? Uh... Cryptic. Vague. Confusing. Contradictory. Obscure. Ambiguous. Uncertain. Unclear. Perplexing. Incoherent. I guess I'll have to purchase a real BOOK if I want to learn aboout the deck and meanings of the cards... my bad... wish they would have shown the booklet though I could have made a more informed choice."
3,Cards in this deck are smaller than in regular deck,"Note that the cards in this deck (ISBN 1-57281-510-8) measure 2 7/8 by 4 /38. The size of the cards is not mentioned in the Amazon listing. This card size is great to do spreads, specially if you have small hands, but the regular size will be better to study the cards or do meditaion on them, as the details on this deck are too small. The print quality and colours are excellent, I am giving this deck 3 stars only because Amazon did not make clear what the size of the cards is."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,This deck is extremely lightweight. The cards will bend at nothing. it is not the original Crowley deck either - it has been updated. Do yourself a favor and get a different deck.
5,Excelente Tarot!!!,"Este excelente Tarot √© a indicado para as pessoas que queiram se familiarizar com os sistemas e estudos relacionados com psicologia filosofia, mitologia e entre outras √°reas do conhecimento.√â recomend√°vel que, junto a este tarot, seja adquirido o Livro de Thot - Aleister Crowley (The Book of Thoth - Aleister Crowley) e o Tar: Espelho da Alma - Gerd Ziegler (Tarot: Mirror of the Soul - Gerd Ziegler), para se ter uma base sobre a historia por tr√°s de cada carta e como interpreta-las"
3,Best Deck,"Thoth Deck is the best deck ever, and I have had 2 disappear on me, it is sad they no longer print the large decks, as those were the really nice ones, now all they have is the Rider Pack, regular sized cards ~sighs~, but the same pics and symbolism, just harder to focus on now ~smiles~"
4,Perfect deck for smaller hands,"While I do agree with other reviews concerning the lesser quality of artwork, it is still beautiful enough to catch the eye--this deck is definitely unique in that each card has its own definitive personality. It is perfect for someone with smaller hands-unlike its larger counterpart. I would recommend this deck to anyone starting out in tarot."
2,Great deck. Bad production.,"I've been a fan of the Thoth deck for 15 years now. I misplaced my original deck and ordered this was a replacement. The images are decent - though much less vibrant than the previous edition - but the production quality on this specific deck is awful. The cards are painfully thing and flimsy. They'd never hold up to regular use, especially if you shuffle the cards before a reading. It's a shame, because this is a great deck, but this low quality product places this edition in the ""barely usable"" category for me."
4,deceptive size,"This deck is fantastic. The only caution I advise is to make sure you check the dimensions of the card carefully. I thought I was getting the larger cards, but I ended up with the small deck. Everything shipped in a timely manner and I would not hesitate to order from this seller again."
4,Wonderful designs and powerful imagery,The Aleister Crowley Thoth Tarot Deck was obviously carefully crafted with regard for the true meanings behind each card and for the feelings that each image invokes. The deck is strewn with lush imagery and colorful symbolism. My only complaint about the deck(and the reason that it only received four stars) was because they're a bit oversized. It's quite difficult to shuffle with these because of their size.
5,LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL,"This edition of the Crowley deck is truly a handful and I found shuffling a tad awkward. However, what a truly amazing sight they are to behold when they are spread out before you in their giant splendor. The colors are similar to the watercolors that you see in impressionist paintings and mostly greens and blues are used to create a dreamy effect. I think Lady Harris, the artist, succeeds with her color schema. Her colors produces a watery and ethereal feeling, which is laced with a strong tenor of surrealism. The overall effect is a nebulous and fantastical feel. Lady Harris is particualrly gifted in capturing dichotomous human instincts beautifully. This deck is a favorite of mine and I highly recommend it. Lady Harris conveys the fantasy, ecstasy, pain and brilliance of the human experience with true empathy."
5,Crowltastic,The deck says small but I prefer the cards that size as opposed to huge poster sized behemoths.They were also shipped super fast and in good nick when they got here.
5,Great deck!,I know someone said that this deck is very negative and that is not true at all. It's only true if you're a negative person in general. It is a great aid to help you see the things that you might repress and also at helping you throughout life in very basic or complex ways. I would definitely recommend it.
1,"Creepy, Bad Energy","I've tried this deck on multiple occasions and find it creepy with bad energy. I think Crowley was a genius but he clearly abused whatever knowledge he was given and that negativity pervades these cards in an uncomfortable way. I'm not saying they're not accurate and this isn't a visually rich, masterful body of work on Crowley's part. But there are other decks out there that bring together the same elements without the strong negativity present here. (Try Haindl instead -- earthy & grounded but just as symbolically rich.)"
3,Beautiful Cards,"This is a beautiful deck, but make no mistake, it was created to promote Aleister Crowley's religion, Thelema (Greek for ""will""). These cards are the ""gateway drug"" of choice for Crowleyans who WILL try to recruit you given half a chance. They truly believe Thelema is the hope and salvation of all mankind. The group is hierarchical in structure and teaches that the ""elect,"" those at the top, will reign over the masses (who are only fit to serve) in the aeon (age) of Horus. They've been saying this since 1904 and still no Thelemic revolution, but it's gonna happen, honest."
5,Awesome Art,"I was first drawn to this deck for the artwork alone and then only later to messing around with readings. Some people complain that this belgium print (US Games) is green and murkey compared to the brighter Switzerland print by AGM which is out of print. I think they are awesome the way they are but have to admit i've never seen the latter. But seeing as how they are out of print and cost around $200 for a used set on amazon, i won't be seeing the difference any time soon."
5,One word description: Dark.,"I have used several different decks in my nearly twenty years of reading. Each deck has it's own merits, and I believe that most of the strength in a reading comes from the reader, and the cards are just a tool the reader is using. There are decks I prefer for certain situations however, and when I want painfully accurate, this deck is the one I reach for. It has an attitude, and has never given me a very positive reading. The Thoth deck is well worth it if you feel a connection with the darker or 'gothy' side of the road."
2,NOT THE DECK FROM SWITZERLAND!!,"I purchased this deck expecting to receive the one pictured that is printed in Switzerland. All of the other reviews exclaim happily that it is as well. Instead of getting the red and white packaged deck in the mail I got a purple and coloured package from Game Systems U.S.A. that is printed in Belgium. Very dissapointing. The colours are greenish in hue and not true to the originals. I wish that the picture of the item and the reviews hadn't been so misleading, as I never would have purchased them if I had known."
4,"Visually Stunning, But Harder to Master","This is by far one of the most beautiful decks I've ever owned, and one of the more powerful working tools out there. I recommend it to people who want to add to a collection and to those who wish to do serious work and study with their tarot decks.The deck does deviate in many places from the ""standard"" Rider-Waite format and interpretations, and it uses Kabbalistic symbols and interpretations, so it isn't the best choice for a beginning or intermediate reader. I do highly recommend hunting down a copy of the helpful companion book for this deck because it gives a full card synopsis and exploration of the meaning of each card."
3,"Excellent deck, but too big and the colours are *dead*.","I like the Thoth deck a lot, but this edition has two major problems.First, the cards are rather large which make the deck hard to shuffle.Second, the cards have a greenish hue and the colours are somewhat dead, especially compared to the other edition.Personally, I recommnd people to buy the smaller livlier coloured edition."
5,"Resplendent art, and you don't have to love Crowley","I just came to say: these cards are exquisitely rendered and will provoke an interest in projected geometry, at the very least. You don't have to like Crowley or identify with his mysticism to appreciate the beauty and utility of these cards."
4,"the ""real"" Mission Impossible","Forget the Tom Cruise movies...this is the original and the best. Like any other first season of a TV drama, MI is trying to find it's niche, by the end of the discs, you can see they have a winning formula down, and by the 2nd season it just gets better. Peter Graves is not in the first season, but is so associated with the series, that many people might be suprised. Steven Hill does an okay job as Briggs the IMF leader. Viewers who know the shows behind the scenes history, you know how difficult he was to work with at the times, and why he was written out, and eventually replaced with Graves. I wish there had been some extras...something, interviews..but there is not. Still it was an amazing show for it's time and still a joy to watch. I cannot wait for season 2 to be released."
5,At Last..The REAL Mission Impossible is Available!,"I grew up watching this series and was so impressed by the ensemble continuity, and the action in the show. Even today decades later, it's still a winner. Cinnamon still beats out ALL of today's femme fatale action/spies. The plots are still intriguing, and it's amusing to see everyone smoking and drinking as during that time it was socially acceptable! I'm still loving it and all of the characters. I'm glad it's finally been made availabe for us to enjoy all over again, or for the first time."
4,MATURITY,"Like a good wine this series improves with age. It has lost none of it's original interest, and is well worth a second viewing.Andy Bowman filmfundi"
5,The real Deal,"Of course a little slower than the new version, but these guys are the best and carefully planned and good!"
4,enjoyable,I don't remember this team leaderBut the missions are coolWay better than most of that space movie stuff we get
4,Good but looking forward to Peter Graves in season 2,I've watched about half of the first season and have enjoyed it so far. I agree with some of the reviewers that I prefer Graves to Steven Hill. It is obviously dated (technology wise) but still very entertaining.
5,Calling all secret agents!!!!!!!!,"Being a baby boomer myself, I grew up around the boob tube as it was called during that day, and I fondly remember watching all of the secret agent shows with my dad, amongst the faves were I-Spy(a diverse, but catchy series high-lighting the acting talents of Robert Culp and Bill Cosby, Mission Impossible with Peter Graves, Barbara Bain (WHAT A FOX!!!), Martin Landau and of course the talented Greg Morris. The Avengers and Secret Agent Man used British acting talent to portray their heroes and heroines. James Bond will of course be one of the greatest spies ever to have graced the screen (Sean Connery was my favorite!!) I will not be happy until the digital cos. take the time to release The Man from U.N.C.L.E., another '60's classic, Long live the secret agent!!!!!!!"
5,Your Mission... should you decide to accept it... is to acquire all seasons of Mission Impossible!,"Mission Impossible provides the action / adventure of good against evil, surrounded by gadgets that would rival the best of James Bond and technological advance that provides a view of what is possible. Still remember coming home to watch each and every episode, and now that it has finally been released, it is impossible not to own all seasons of Mission Impossible. The cast is excellent, the plots are brilliantly written and executed, and the locations where the episodes take place provide an awesome experience. So... our mission, should we decide to accept it... is to enjoy all seasons offered of Mission Impossible."
5,I hate the arrogance,"I haven't gotten this set yet, but I had to vote to counter the man who comlained about the lack of close captioning.While I sympathize with his condition, his statement that we will be disappointed smacks of self absorption. Maybe we will be disappointed, but not because HE is unable to hear the set.The world does not revolve around his desires and to univeralize them shows his own cramped world view."
2,Mission Really Is Impossible,"What a diappointment! I like to get what I pay for and this ""Mission"" WAS impossible. Being hard of hearing I always look before I buy to see if a DVD has English Closed Captioning so I can at least see what the actors are saying. ""Mission Impossible"" said that it did, not only in the Amazon listing, but on the DVD's themselves. It's not there. Nowhere can I bring it up or see where it is. I won't be buying any more seasons unless they can prove to me it's on there. False advertizing. (Added April 17, 2007) After contacting Paramount Home Sales in California, about the lack of Closed Captioning on my two DVD sets, they sent me a brand new DVD set that the CC worked perfect on! I was amazed! Thank you Paramount! L.W."
3,Mission Impossible Complete 1st Season,I remember the show when it was the only thing to watch. We were so excited to see the show we could hardly wait for it to air.FF to now and the show seems dated at the very least. At the time the plotsseem believable but now it would be inconceivable that anyone would be sonive as to let the sort of trickery happen in front there eyes.That being said the quility of the pictures are excellent the audio isalso excellent. It is nice to see Steven Hill as a young man and to seehim in Law and Order now. It's amusing to see how simular his manerismsand expresion have not changes over the years. Thanks for the look back.From the stand point of amusinment this product is great.
5,Fantastic!,"I just bought this dvd collection and have already watched the first four episodes. Wow o Wow, this is better than watching it for the first time in the sixties. The clarity is excellent and the sound quality is like being there. This was my favorite show at the time and being able to watch it today is like a special Christmas present. Thank you so much! You won't go wrong purchasing this set."
5,If you watched Mission Impossible you must have this CD!!,I know this is an old television series but I find it to be most entertaining.
5,Awesome Remastering,"I admit it, I am hooked. They did such a great job remastering the first season, I couldn't stop until I watched all 28 episodes. When is Season 2 coming out? I am going to see Peter Graves in Orlando in late Jan 07. I highly recommend this set."
4,Good show ... Coming Seasons are better,"What more can I say,It is best show ever though I prefer Mr. Phelps way more than Mr. Briggs. I mean I agree with one of the comments Steven Hills has a wooden appearance. I am on for the 3rd season once it is released.Enjoy..."
4,Its a classic,"Hard to say more than that, its a classic. Love the story line. Great acting with some fun and drama too."
4,Living in the past.,"Watching these take me back to a more innocent time of tv viewing. The quality of the dvds is very good. Though the plots of each show are interchangeable, it's still fun watching the heroes use what was then ""state-of-the-art"" equipment to con the bad guys. And you never see people get seriously hurt."
5,What have I missed??,"I was 12 years when this series aired on CBS, so I didn't know anything about it until 1972 when I saw my first episode in a Williams, Arizona motel room, right on US-66.Little did I know then that Peter Graves was preceded by Steven Hill (Briggs). I thought that Steven Hill did a commendable job as the head of his team of infiltrators.Though the DVDs themselves do not have built-in closed-captioning for the hearing-impaired (of which I am), although one of the TV's in my home adapted to it, just watching the players perform their duties is good enough for me.I must add that if one is hearing-impaired and wishes to play the series on a portable DVD player, then it useless because of the lack of subtitles on the DVDs.I do hope that season #2 will be released soon. I have a lot of catching up on these episoded to do."
1,No subtitles and no closed captions?! Why?!,"We discovered that this DVD of Mission Impossible - The Complete First Season will not provide subtitles and no closed captions. 1960's TV Mission Impossible was my favorite TV show of all time. We are hearing impaired (both deaf and hard of hearing) and we want to see what they said from this legendary TV classic show. We survived and endured through hearing impaired discriminations, prejudice and bigotry such as Audism. Please don't buy this DVD without subtitles and no closed captions because they deliberately copied from TV screen show to video without mastering of high-digital video techniques such as coloring, subtitles, etc. Paramount Home Video company often made cheap and flawed DVD video in order to boost their profit while lower the video quality. You will be deeply disappointed when you see this DVD of ""Mission Impossible - The Complete First Season""."
3,Pre Peter Graves IMF,THe Plots are tedious but entertaining remember its 1964. TV is only 10 years old.
2,This is 2006!!! Not 1966!!!,"J.R. Nelson is correct!! Half of the movie, or DVD, viewing experience is the sound!!! This DVD is in mono!!!!!!!! All the positives about this series remains - the best of all time. But, the 3 Cruise versions all have way, way, better sound, and DVD extras. I fully recommend the 5 ""Alias"" seasons over this package because of the far superior sound, and obvious similarities to the original Mission: Impossible tv series."
1,Missions Utterly Brain Dead,"Rocky and Bullwinkle convey uber-intelligence compared to this 60s network drek.Cheesy, piecemeal, and repetitious sets coupled with lackluster scripts, and utterly staid dialogue define this blackhole of flimsy intrigue and unimaginative suspense.The only notable remains the opening score.Comatose patients would undoubtedly find these plots further coma-inducing.What were people NOT thinking???Oh yes, and let's not forget Barbara Bain, who deservedly earns a decades-long-due razzie for her singular-dimensional and breathy, cliched-ridden sexpot agent, who equates smoking with acting, and who readily wore-out-her-welcome in just Season One, alone.Don't waste your money - unless, of course, you're brain-dead and regrettably house-bound.Hoping Season Two ""self-destructs"" before it reaches self-deluding consumers."
5,Amazing Product,"One of the biggest pluses about this juicer is the easy clean-up. It's much easier to clean than my Jack LaLane Juicer and can easily juice tougher vegetables like beets,whole carrots or whole apples."
5,Love it!!!,I love my new Breville Juice Fountain...Juicing is my new favorite thing to do! Finding new combinations to juice is so fun!!
5,Amazing,"This juicer is simply amazing. We are thoroughly enjoying it. It is still going strong, and we would happily buy it again."
4,Just what I expected,"I've owned this now for a month and have juice on a daily or twice daily schedule. It gobbles up carrots, apples, celery, ect. I does just what I thought it would with leafy greens, shreds them into pieces and spits them into the bucket. Which means, green juice, nada, nothing. That is disappointing, but the speed of juicing, and cleaning makes it worth it. I figure some juice is better than no juice, right? I only have to chop large apples, and most everything else fits in the chute."
5,Good Juicer,"I received my juicer recently and i'm very happy with it. Went to the grocery and stocked up on produce to try today. So far, I've used it twice today. Juicing is simple and cleanup is very easy. My old juicer just couldn't keep up with our vegan household demands, but the Breville was great."
5,Best Juicer,"This Juicer is the best I replaced a nice Waring but Waring can't hold ground to the Breville one. This juicer chops through everything I can place in it and doesn't waste any juice. It is a BIG juicer so make sure you have space if you live in a tiny Chicago apartment say goodbye to your counter space, but it is worth it."
2,"easy to use and quick, but very wasteful","ProsThis is very easy to usefeeding stuff in is much faster than with auger type juicersit is fairly easy to cleanConsit wastes a lot of juice leaving it in the pulpI feed greens, fruits and vegetables in and got about 3.5 cups of juiceI then fed the pulp in to an auger type juicer and got another 2 cups of juiceNormally when I use an auger juicer with the same amount of stuff, I get about 5 cups of juiceThe only advantage to this juicer is that it takes a little less than half the time to process everything.So now I regularly use this first since i own it already. This step makes it really easy then to feed the better juicer. The overall time is about the same, but it takes a lot less effort.However I wouldn't normally recommend that anyone buy both because of the cost."
5,Awesome,"I was vacationing in Mexico recently and I was pampered with the convience of having fresh jucie daily. I thought...it's time to do this at home. Yet, I didn't want to go to the juice bar daily. I bought this juicer. It is awesome. Fast, efficient, and easy and quick to clean."
4,Beautiful Machine,"I bought this juicer for my wife (and family) as a birthday gift. We use it nearly every day now.Pros: Really easy cleanup (we also use biodegradeable bags so we just toss the bag right into our composting bin), simple to use.Cons: Very tall - doesn't fit under our cabinetry in the kitchen.All in all I'm very happy with the result. I've told my wife that I'd like to try using it to chip brush from the yard as well..."
3,Breville 800JEXL Juicer was a bit dissappointing,"The Breville 800JEXL Fountain juicer looks very attactive, nice and shiny, stainless steel, heavy, powerful, etc., but as far as the amount of juice it actually extracted from vegetables it was very dissapointing! I have the champion juicer and thought I was upgrading by buying the more expensive Breville juicer, but i was wrong. I compared them side by side and got almost double the juice with the champion juicer."
3,Like throwing the baby out with the bath water,"I'm new to juicing and just purchased this unit a week ago after doing my research and reading reviews. I'm disappointed with how wet the pulp is in addition to chunks of product not getting juiced and thrown in to the pulp collector bin. I used both speeds and also pushed the plunger down slow as recommended but same result. I think this is an inherent design flaw due to the distance between the chute and the cutting blade being too great allowing pieces to get thrown out without getting juiced. Forget trying to juice leafy greens like spinach as you'll have little juice after putting in the whole bag and much of it thrown in the pulp collector. Unless you have an unlimited grocery budget and can afford such inefficient results, I'd consider going with a high quality smoothie maker or other juicing method such as grind and press. Less waste, more goodness!"
5,What a juicer!,"This is the best juicer I have ever had or used (I've had 4, and used 3 others at friends' houses). First, it has POWER going for it...1000 Watts! It doesn't even slow down for the big fruits and veggies that normally make the average juicer stop altogether. It also has quality construction on its side; stainless and titanium parts, which add to its third big plus, the fact that it is way easy to clean. You won't be sorry you got this one!"
1,Too hyped!,We purchased the Breville juicer about 3 yrs ago. No we haven't been using it that long. We only got a few months out of it when the juicing basket literally fell apart! We replaced it at 33.00. But that only lasted 3-4 months. So add it up-every 3 mo. that's over $100.00 a yr. to run this thing! Also company service was terrible!!
5,Love,"This juicer is heavy duty, strong, and efficient. It's easy to take apart and clean. Juicing is great for health and vitality. I foresee having this appliance for years to come."
5,It's just TOO great and TOO beautiful!,"This is the most perfectly engineered and best performing juicer I've ever had. It spins up slowly to prevent the unit from jumping unexpectedly upon startup, looks absolutely fantastic on the counter, has very solid feet with treads that grip the counter, and is a pleasure to use. I had a Juice Man previously, and oh what a piece of crap that was compared to this. The Juice Man (and its La Lane, Waring, Krups, and other similars) is a toy, while the Breville 800JEXL is a professional grade appliance that will last the test of time.Well, there is one downside. It's just so beautiful to look at that I am compelled to meticulously clean it after every juicing, which is insane but necessary with such a gorgeous appliance. Oh well, I guess I can live with that! :)Buy it. You'll LOVE it!"
3,Too much waste,"The Breville makes beautiful juice, but there is more than 50% waste by weight. I wish I had researched more. I now have a Breville for sale for someone who wishes only juice and no fiber. For this the product is lovely. I ended up purchasing another product where there is NO waste, with all the fruit/vegetables being processed. I am much happier with that, and figure that the savings in fruits and vegetables with pay for both the units in one year."
2,Not For Greens - Not for Me,This unit is a spinning centrifugal type so it just shoots greens out the waste unless you do some fancy footwork to get them to work. I moved onto the OMEGA and love love love that one mucho better than this. Also it does not add oxygen to your foods like centrifugal juicers do.
5,Breville 800JEXL Juice,"This is hands down the best juicer I have ever seen or used myself, I have several friends who juice religiously and have seen and used their machines and this baby whips them all.I was diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma a month ago and started juicing right away,I Juice every Morning,This machine is fast, quite, clean and gets every drop of juice out of everything I have tried, and discards a barely damp pulp. and it is very easy to use and to clean.I Love this Juicer it is Great!!!"
5,This is the Boss of Juice Extrctors,Fast cleanup; powerful motor; looks nice; if you have the money get this one!!! I am a triathlete and will use it a lot.
4,A solid product,"Love this solid product. High performance, easy to clean, and most importantly wife loves it, too. The only complain I have is there're two samll gaps between the juicer cover and the pulp container, one on each side, that cause juice to spit out. You might want to put a plastic bag in pulp container and cover up both edges to prevent juice to spit. Overall, a product worth to own."
4,Breville 800 Juicer,"We liked the idea of a upright juicer. After researching reviews of other juicers the 800 seemed to be the ""right"" choice. What sold me was the simplicity and the quality. Multi speed was not needed. This unit is two speed and does the job. We have only used the high speed to date and can't imagine needing a multi-speed unit. Well built - good product!"
4,Breville 800JEXL Jumpstarted My Weight Loss,"I have been trying to get motivated about weight loss and have not been able to do it. When I first saw this machine online, the simple design caught my attention. When it arrived, I am very pleased but the weight of the box. It is a substantial machine on your countertop. The base of the machine is diecast. When you turn it on, the engine purrs like a German car. I like heavy duty appliances and this definitely fit my need.It works very well with all kinds of vegitables. Good for fruits too, but I do see the fruit pulp being a bit wet. Some people don't like foam, I am not bothered by it. I let the juice sit a while and stir it, usually most foam dissapear.I have been using it for about 4 weeks now. I have been juicing + a big salad each day, occationally I cheat a little bit when going out. I have lost 10 lbs so far. I plan on staying on this diet for another month and will add more plant-based protein and whole grain to the diet."
4,Love this product,"It's worth it. I was a little concern with the price at first, but I soon got over it. I love this product. I use it daily. Easy to use and clean. Love to two speeds for soft and hard produce. I love the pitcher, it's hold back the foam. If you have the money to spend buy this juicer hands down the best!"
5,You get what you pay for.,"I just bought this juicer and love it. I've had the Jack Lalanne juicer for 2 years. The Breville Juicer is sturdy, faster and easy to clean. The Lalanne juicer was way too messy to clean and it did not capture all of the pulp in the bin. I'd have to clean the counter and kitchen walls whenever I used the Lanlanne juicer. I juice oranges, lemons and fruit, so I cannot compare either juicer on leafy vegetables or greens. The Breville juices within seconds, skin and all and doesn't make as much noise as the Lalanne juicer. I wanted to juice my drink quickly without having to clean up a mess afterward. For all of those reasons it was worth the 260 I paid for the Breville."
5,Close to perfect,"Excellent juicer. Last part of whaterve your juicing always causes a loud ""clunck"" sond as it shoots it to the waste basket, but it sucks all the juice out of everything. Not too loud considering its power. Very easy to clean, assemble and disassemble. Great buy."
2,Anyone with corrosion problem?,"Some juice splashes between the rotor and the top during juicing and corrosion appeared on the top of the rotor. I think the top is in plastic, not metal. Since I cleaned the juicer after each use, I noticed the presence of juice and cleaned it. But after three months, corrosion appeared and impossible to remove. I called BrevilleUSA and they asked me to clean with white vinegar and send a picture. After 10 days, no response!"
5,Easy to use; Quick to clean,"Although the Breville 800 has several different parts, this juicer is easy to use and quick to clean. Makes GREAT juice!!"
4,Wonderful Juicer,"I love this juicer... I know it may not be the top of the line Juicer, but it serves me well.It juices everything.... Parsley, spinach,kale, leafy greens that you wouldn't expect could be juiced with a lot of yield ,yet it does!It is also very powerful and not at all noisy....as some others I have tried. I have purchased two of these ,one for my Canadian home and one for my Florida home. Did I mention that I LOVE THIS JUICER!"
5,this Juicer is the bomb,A friend of mine recommend this one I bought it and love it. I have used 3 times so far andlove it. Easy to use Easy for cleaning up. Highly recommend it
5,Love this juicer,"This juicer hardly needs another glowing review, but I love it too. One review mentioned leakage, I've had none, not a drop. Its a big machine and it does the job."
4,Bangin',"This juicer is pretty tyte. Only problem we've had is with small leafy greens (ie. parsley, cilantro.) If you sandwich them between some celery stalks they get juiced a little better, but I would suggest getting a masticating juicer if you think you will use a lot of parsley/cilantro.Otherwise this juicer rules!!!!"
3,Not great for leafy greens!,We mainly juice leafy greens and this juicer left a lof of wet pulp. Did not extract juice well. Going to try a masiticating juicer.
3,Very good for average juicing. I would recommend something else for extended Juice Fasting,"This juicer was fast, easy to clean, and it is very well built. The down side is I was looking for a juicer for a 60 day juice fast and this one worked but got dulled in just 3 weeks of juicing. Now, granted, I was juicing 3 times a day and I did attempt to juice coconut meat for cocobutter at one time so that may have had something to do with it. For juicing purposes, this juicer worked fine but next time I will buy a masticating juicer which presses the juice out more efficiently."
4,compatible with reviews,"I researched on many juicing sites for the best juicer, this one came up often. It is a bit noisier than I expected from the reviews/articles I've read. The pulp is wetter than my other juicers I've had, which is disappointing. I am pleased with how quick the juicer is-I used to have to cut up my fruits/vegetables which took a really long time in prep work, but now, I just have to clean them. I can put several carrots in at a time! I considered returning it due to the amount of wet pulp, but the ease of it and the quick clean up won me over!"
4,Fantastic.,"Really a great juicer. So easy to clean. Smart design. Powerful. Stick an apple in it and watch it disappear. Extracts a ton of juice. I only had trouble with avocados and mangoes; pulpy, oily items that are better blended than juiced. Otherwise, an absolute joy. Supposedly can't handle wheat grass either. But anything you'd normally juice is handled easy-peasy."
4,Beautiful Addition To My Countertop.,"Juicer looks great, and is very well made. I would buy it again.It is easier to clean than the other juicer I have used. It also has a very large feed chute that means less cutting. It never slows the motor down.Pulp is usually a little wet still, especially tomatoes.Juice is usually foamy, I think that is all juicers.I really like it, and I use it almost every day.I recommend getting a compost container for under your sink with any juicer. The pulp turns into great topsoil."
2,"licking, spitting, inefficient juicer","This juicer is not efficient as it requires much more fruits than my previous juicer to extract the same amount of juice. To get two pints of juice I used about 6-7 pounds of apples! At the same time if I squeezed waste by hand, I would have got, at least, one-two glasses more.You will never get carrot juice, it comes out as puree, so forget about vegetables.Moreover, pulp container licks and spits."
2,Disappointing,"I loved this juicer when I first bought it. It was so efficient and fast. The pulp came out almost dry. We used it almost daily to juice carrots. After 6 weeks, the pulp started coming out wet with lots of chunks. It was spitting juice out the side near the pulp chute and producing a lot less juice. I think this is because the blades in the filter are already dulled. What a disappointment. It's going back to the store today."
5,Great Daily Juicer!,"I purchased this model after being disappointed with the less expensive Breville juicer. I love this juicer and use it daily. It juices quickly and provides more juice than the cheaper model. The Stainless Steel components are easier to clean and the mesh net does not clog (I have not had to soak it as the manual recommends). The waste is nearly dry when using this machine, which gives me confidence that I'm getting my money's worth. My only issue with the product is that you really need to adjust the components or it leaks. Overall, this product is worth the extra money."
5,Fantastic Juicer*****High Quality Product,"Wow, The machine is just excellent..HIGH QUALITY...All stainless easy to clean, goes through celery,carrots, beets like theres nothing there..Amazing juice, amazing machine..Worth every penny."
3,scale builup and discoloration,could anyone out there please tell me how to clean the scale buildup from daily use and the resulting discoloration of the clear plastic parts? please...
1,Breville,"Parts are missing!!!!!! What a huge disappointment!!!!! I have my vegetables and fruit all cut up and on the counter and realize I can't juice anything with parts missing. Wow, you pay a few hundred dollars for a machine and it doesn't work. Breville you've failed me!!!!!!!"
3,Caution: does not create a juice fountain as advertised.,"My wife loves orange juice, and when organizing her 70th birthday party I purchased this Juice Fountain hoping to create a dramatic display in our foyer as people came into our home. While it looks like the juice shoots up from the top in the photos, instead it shoots out from a nozzle on the side, and it doesn't keep running like a fountain normally would. This is more for someone who wants a glass of juice. I returned mine. My wife is disappointed."
1,Mis Leading,"It's a good juicer. But before you believe the hype about saving x amount of dollars, check the manufacturers website. They say this is listed as 399 and your saving 100 bucks... not from this manufacturer, they list it for the same price.Juicing is one of the healthiest things you can do for your body. Vegetables in raw form are so full of micro nutrients their potential is only just being realized. Don't let sellers use that as an opportunity to take advantage of you, check your product and the claims by doing your research first."
5,Great Machine,You have to try it before you truly understand how great this item is. My wife and i juice with it every morning and it works easy and quickly.
5,Loved by a Periodic Juicer,"I purchased this juicer nine months ago and have been very pleased. I use it periodically-- every month or two I go through a period where I'll juice once or twice daily for a week or two, and then I don't use it for a while.The juicer looks good on the counter, washes up quickly, and the pieces fit in my dish drainer to drip dry.Once I juiced a tomato and although I tried to get the presser-thing over the top very quickly, I still got a little splatter on my mini blinds nearby. It cleaned up just fine though, and now I just make sure to raise the blinds if I am juicing squishy things. I haven't had any other splattering issues, though, it's really nicely made to stay neat.When I was shopping for a juicer I spent a lot of time comparing models, and now I'm glad I did. This juicer is a great fit for me.."
1,The look is deceptive,"I bought Breville juicer after using Jack LaLanne's.I feel very sorry when buying this juicer because it is extremely difficult to control. If pressure is light, fruits or vegies do not go through, and when more pressure is pressed, they go through too fast. And usually at the end of juicing there is a strong jerking motion because fruite or vegies go through UNprocessed, no matter what speed is.If you use Jack Lalanne before you will love Jack's much more than this. I think this machine is for someone wants to waste fruits or vegetables because the pulp in container is heavier than Jack's.I use it for 2 weeks and I come back to Jack LaLanne. Breville better RE-designs this one."
2,Not the best for the price,"My take on this is after using 3 different models and finding that this is simply a high priced name with an average product. Parts are costly, yield is dry and lower than average, and clean up is a mess. This is not a well designed model. They hide it's inefficiency with bulky stainless steel and a grandiose name ""Elite"". There is nothing elite about this that I can't get from a model $200 less. I will not make this mistake again."
5,"Love this juicer! Powerful, easy to clean. Love it!","I'll never be able to drink bottled juice again. This powerful juicer wrings every drop of moisture from whatever you drop in. Carrots, oranges, apples, garlic, onion...whatever. Clean up is a breeze, especially if you line the pulp bin with the vegetable bags from the grocery store. If your in the market and you can afford it, this is the one you want. Worth the money."
5,Excellent and powerful unit,"The Breville 800JEXL Juice extractor is an excellent product. It's a solid machine, easy to clean and juices in a matter of seconds. I recommend this product highly."
5,Best juicer I've had so far!,"I love this juicer! The juicer produces so much more juice and less pulp, very easy clean up and less noisy than my old juicer (the Juiceman JM480S). Paying more for this juicer was well worth it! I am now a fan of Breville products!"
4,So far so good!,"Bought this a short time ago. It has power, is quiet and works very well. Clean up is pretty easy. Will chew several lbs. of carrots in a very short time. 30 sec or so."
1,full of regret and out of $$!,"I thought I bought a great model...was so wrong! I end up with wet pulp every single time! I have to ring the pulp with my hands and its too much work. I spent a lot of money on this model and all I've gained is trouble. Making juice is such a hassle! I wish I could return it for a better model. If you are thinking about buying this model, I would reconsider! sad customer here!!! :("
1,One Bad Juicer,"This juicer is the worse buy I have ever made on amazon. It spits food everywhere, and I mean everywhere. The pulp container leaks liquids, the feeder shoot can pop out whole pieces of veggie up in the air and away from the unit, and please wear a rain slicker while using because it is going to get on your clothes. Easy to clean? I guess so, so long as you are willing to also clean every inch of your kitchen within 6 feet of the unit including the cabinets. I ordered this unit special fast delivery because my elderly father needs the juice. I was a fool, I hope you are not as big a fool as I am. I will return it, and hopefully get my money back. This juicer is a disaster. It even throws whole pieces of veggie and fruit away into the pulp container after just 4 uses. This is a waste of time and money, especially for the organic juicer. Who can afford to throw away whole pieces of veggie? This is on my DO NOT BUY list, and should be on yours."
3,Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite,"Great Juicer, however the instructions had mentioned dishwasher safe and not all the pieces are safe to put in the dishwasher. The plastic piece to push down the fruit expanded in the dishwasher and no longer fits properly. This happened only after a few uses. I tried calling but it is impossible to get through to a live agent. They do give you an option to leave your phone number and they do get back to you. But if you are not around when they return your call, you have to go through the same thing all over again."
5,Fabulous!!!,"this is the best juicer i have owned. i also had the jack lalane juicer. the worst! the breville is so durable and easy to clean. i would clean it right away as opposed to letting the pulp dry in the strainer. very sturdy machine. i have owned it for a year and while it is pricey, it was worth every penny. i spent $125 on the jack lalane juicer, and that was a total waste."
1,Don't buy if you're going to juice everyday.,"I bought this item on 10/22/06, the first week I loved it but within 3 weeks of jucing 3-4 times daily the blade is dull. I normally juice apple(cored), pear(cored), celery, carrots, grapes, Kale or Chard, red peppers. I have followed the directions from day one and have even tried their suggested vinegar soak on the filter basket to no avail.My final conclusion is this just isn't the juicer for someone planning to juice 2-3 times a day, 7 days a week. I'm returning this one.A serious juicer for life."
1,Can not get parts.,I used this juicer fot a year and a half before it broke. Called Breville and could not get the part I needed to fix it. They gave me a number for a service center who could also not get the part (gasket). So off to the dumpster with my $299 juicer! I will NEVER buy Breville again.
1,Achilles heel - clogged filter basket and dull teeth,"When you pay $300 for a juicer you expect Hi-Q all the way. This machine has a powerful motor and a heavy-duty stainless steel look. But, oh, it lets you down! I've owned one for 6 months and take pretty good care to rinse and wash the parts after use. But apparently pretty good is not enough. After 6 months my 3 times a week carrot-beet juice seems to have KOed the filter basket. Plus the ""titanium cutting wheel"" seems now to have dulled itself sending gobs of wet pulp to the waste catcher rather than into my juice. It amounts to $60+ replacement. What a sting!For 10 years I had a French made Tefal juicer ($49) and it worked just fine. This super high-priced replacement has failed me in 6 months. Sorely disappointed and feeling ripped off especially after reading all these glowing Amazon reviews."
3,pulp,"I love the speed it juices the carrots! But the pulp is NOT as dry as I thought it would be. I put the pulp through twice. Its more work, but more juice. Thank You."
4,juice me,sturdy and efficienteasy clean upwonderful tool to get yourself back in shapefresh fruit cocktails!Stainless steel partsnice size pitcheressentially works right out of the boxeasy assembly
4,Great Juicer except for spinach,It's been 1 month since I got this juicer. It's just great. I can extract plenty of juice in just seconds. And the clean up is not bad. I wash it by myself when I can or just leave it in the dish washer when I don't have time. I use it on daily basis. Only thing I don't like is it doesn't extract much juice from leafy vegetables like spinach.
3,disappointed,After spending many hours trying to decide which juicer I should buy I finally decided on this breville . I got the juicer and tried it right away and wanted to cry. I was so excited to get it and then I was so disappointed with the way it juiced. I love that you can throw the whole apple in but so much is wasted because the pulp is so wet. I even had little slices of apples in the pulp which was wierd to me. Needless to say I wish I wouldn't have bought the expensive one.
5,The ultimate Juicer,"This juicer was bought for a friend after he visited and saw mine. If you are going to lay out money for a juicer, buy Breville, the best. Easy to clan and has the power to juice anything worth juicing."
5,Perfect trensaction!!!! Extremely Fast!!!,I can't say enough about this juicer. Surely there isn't a better juicer available anywhere at any price. And it got here faster than I could have imagined. Thank you for a perfect transaction!!
5,Breville 800 JEXL,"Just perfect!!!Very powerfull(sounds like turbine in the car!)High quality build,exellent design!!!With right maintanance will last forever!"
2,totally died after only 2 years,I loved the design of this juicer and it was easy to use and easy to clean. I was very disappointed that company only offered a one year warranty. I don't recommend this juicer unless you only want to get two years of use out of it.
3,Excellent Juicer,"I have been using the Breville 800JEXL for a month now and I couldn't be happier. The ease of juicing and the quick easy clean up is wonderful. The healthiest thing I have done in awhile.The juice seems to taste better from this juicer, well built and woth the extra money."
2,Not Happy with Juice fountain,"We have been using an Acme Supreme Juicer. We find that the pulp is drier from the Acme. Very little juice can be squeezed out by hand from the pulp of the Acme as compaired to the Juice Fountain, the pulp is very wet.More pulp is passed through the Juice Fountain filter than the Acme disposable filter.I find the Acme is easier to clean and we are going back to the Acme Supreme Juicer. The Breville was a waste of time and money."
4,High Speed Kitchen Mess!,"The unit is built like a tank! WOW! There is a reason they give a pitcher w/ this puppy... on high speed the juice just flys outa this thing! Can create quite a mess. If you don't like messes this unit might not be for u. That said, it works great, is easy to clean and is VERY well built. I love it. But I don't use a glass to collect the juice anymore."
3,"Powerful, makes great juice but leaks!","I have used this product for about a month now (3-4 times a week). It is definitely a powerful and efficient juicer, much better than the Cuisineart it replaced. Sturdy construction and easy to clean. I just have one problem - it leaks and splatters juice. Right where the pulp catcher and the snap on lid come together has a small gap. During the juicing process small abouts of liquid makes its way through the gap and the vibrations cause it to splatter all over the place. Worse with some products than others (beets create a real mess). I have tried the recommended fix (plastic bag in the pulp catcher) but it doesn't help. The only way I can use the juicer now is to cover the top with a paper towel and hold it in place which is easier said than done.I have a warranty request into Breville and will report back on how helpful they are dealing with this issue."
5,Awesome juicer,"This is the best juicer on the market. Great price through Amazon. I use it daily and it works beautifully. Very rugged, easy to clean and best of all my fiance loves it. He makes me fruit and vegetable juices daily. You cannot go wrong with this product. Do not try to save money buying a cheaper brand. This is the best on the market by far."
3,There is a gap where the plastic meets the metal bowl holder,"Quality is ok. For the price I expected better. My major complaint is the gap between the plastic cover and the stainless bowl holder. When I juice beets, I need to lay a paper towel over the top cover on the right hand side. Otherwise, purple juice sprays out the side!They could have easily used a rubber gasquet to seal the top cover."
4,Excellent Juicer,This juicer is excellent for the person on the go who wants to drink healthy juice. I also have the Green Star and I do feel it is superior at getting more juice from the pulp but it is also more time consuming to chop the vegetables and clean the equipment. So if you don't mind a bit of waste then I highly recommend this juicer. I did 40 lbs of apples in less than an hour including the clean up. It does tend to spit out the last part of the skin and some items leave a wetter pulp. I didn't like the results of putting it through the dishwasher as it baked on some residue that I didn't see when I rinsed before putting it in and have been unable to get it off the plastic lid. Extra care must be given to cleaning all the cracks and crevices as food stays up in the edges and is difficult to see until it dries. If you are looking for a good citrus juicer I highly recommend the one by Breville.
2,decent when working,"I bought this juicer 2 month ago. used it for several time. When working, it does a good job with all sorts of fruits. But like another reviewer mentioned, because the mouth of the feed is large and also the design of the feed is directly above the motor, frequently pieces of fruits get spits back out. My eyes got hit a couple of time. Also the two speeds work pretty much the same in term of producing pulp in juice (like another reviewer mentioned, there was NO difference, what a waste of the two speed). Biggest travesty of all, the juicer stopped working after just 2 month. Tried to put in a medium juice apple in and the blade made some noise and then the motor just died. Tried to contact company about sending it back but never got arny response from Breville. Very disappoint and advise others against getting the juicer. particularly for close fo 250-300 dollars. Save your money!"
1,Died after 5 uses. Amazon and Breville will not refund it.,"I received this as a gift at the end of November for my birthday. I opened it and started using it in mid December, and it would not power up after 5 uses. When I contacted Breville, they said that the seller on Amazon was not an authorized dealer and would not replace it. Amazon said the refund period ended December 9th. I am so upset with this juicer and the Amazon/Breville refund system. They should both stand by this very expensive product and give me a full refund or a replacement. I will continue to pursue a refund. This juicer died after 5 uses and after researching online I see others have had a similar fate. I do not recommend this product."
4,Great Juicer (some exceptions),We bought this juicer about a month back and we use it a few times daily. So far it has been juicing well. It easy to clean.The only issue I have noticed is that it extracts very little juice from spinach. Pineapple pulp also has some juice remaining in it.
4,First time juicer / works great,"After researching ""juicing"" and the health benefits I decided I'd like to try it. The Breville is quick, easy to use and to clean. It is not very efficient at juicing greens which was fine with me...I had serious trouble getting the juice down anyway! It works great with fruits and vegetables and the juice is quite tasty. I am amazed at how much juice comes out of a carrot! My only complaint is that it forces grapes and blueberries out much to quickly to extract most of the juice; therefore it seems to waste more of the fruit.I have had it for over a month now and still use it frequently since my experimentation with the juice ""fast""."
4,a really solid juicer... no pun intended,"This is a very sturdy juicer, very easy to wash and assemble - I am glad I bought it....however, it does not extract as much juice as my last juicer (am pretty sure it is the juicer and not the fruit!)"
3,Quick but frothy output,I was shocked at the amount of froth produced with apples and quince. OK with softer fruit. High quality fit and finish. Easier to clean than my 1970s Oster Kitchen Center model.
5,(Jacob Klein's Review) Page Turner.,"This is an amazing book that is a real page turner. With Non-Stop action, you will never want to put the book down. Over the summer I read All 3 of these books with amazing speed because of how much I loved them. The reason I love them is because it is a good partially scary story and sucks you into the story making you feel like you are following Ben and Jack through there non-stop adventures, and because the way it is writen, It is written so well as to make you think this is all real. I admire this writers abilities and style. I reccomend this book to the people who enjoy good adventure books and non stop action/horror. Buy this book ASAP."
4,I just revisited this book after 10 years ...,"This was my text for an astronomy class for non-science majors that required the use of algebra but not calculus, the latter of which I had forgotten in the 3 years between my last math class and this one. Due to a rekindled interest in astronomy, I'm now revisiting the book and am struck by Dr. Shu's fine writing and the way the text can be used by those who are comfortable with advanced mathematics (yes, there are problems featuring calculus for those so equipped) as well as the nonmathematical reader or student. Beginning with the building blocks of physics, it is a fine reference for those who want to explore the theoretical side of astronomy.My one quarrel with the book is that it doesn't include or offer a solutions manual for the problems. An explanation of how the problems are done would greatly add to its value."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book for anyone interested in astronomy. It is fine for anyone who is knew to astronomy, although you would be better off with some background in it first. For people who know more about astronomy, it has optional calculus problems, so it covers people with any level of knowledge."
2,"Dayton U37,Great heater, doesn't last, expensive","I have purchased many of the fan forced electric convection heaters (wire element), I feel they work better than the ceramic.After going through several of the heaters I purchased 3 of the Dayton U37 heaters from Air N Water about 2 years ago. All 3 were under a $100 with shipping.The Dayton U37 is a fantastic heater for quick heat in a room, a camper or even a tent in the winter. I love them. But... all 3 are now dead.They now cost almost $100 each. For a 1500 watt heater that is way too much money considering you will only get a few years of regular use before they break.If they would last 10 years or more I'd maybe consider it if it was cheaper, but for a few years use I'll just buy cheaper heaters.Most heaters are around $30 or less, the Dayton U37 is a great heater, but it is not worth $100 even if it lasted 20 years.If it would last, I'd give it 5 stars easy, but because it lasts only a few years and the current price I give it a 2."
1,Junk,It came apart during the very first use. We wanted to use it in place of a wire brush. Won't buy it again.
3,Can't Use on Stainless Steel,Produce description did not say couldn't be used on stainless steel. My grill has stainless steel grates. Found out after product arrived and I read the instructions. Returned for full refund.
1,Beware - could be a carnicen,"This item came with no labelining whatsoever. It's a soft porous item simply wrapped in cellophane. Theres no indication of what the acutal product is. In most cases, it wouldn't be so bad, but this is really soft. When you clean your grill, it leaves a powdery resudy and the 'brick' wears down. Now, when you place you food on the grill, it picks up this powdery dust as the brick degrages. Good luck in figuring out what you just digested. Hopefully, it doesn't cause cancer. We threw them away after the first brick crumbled."
5,Great product,"I use it before every grilling session. Because its made of paper, I do not have to worry about if any residue is left on the grill."
3,More than Oscar's Lover!,"Reading some of the reviews listed I was compelled to remind potential readers that though Douglas Murray is just out of his teens he writes with poise of someone twice his age.Boise was a complex man that warrents a biography. Was he a great poet? I am not sure he was but, he was colorful in any reguard. I always wanted to know more about him. I have seen plays and movies based on the Wilde trials but, never felt the stories did justice to Douglas.I am glad I read this book and feel that I have a greater understanding of this mostly undesirable person."
3,A good start,"Mr. Murray has provided us with a good introduction to the life of Lord Douglas, and has produced a solid first work. The writing is dry and at times the research seems a little shallow, but Murray does exhibit potential. I look forward to his next book. My primary complaint is that in addition to a biography of Lord Douglas, Mr. Murray spends too much ink discussing Douglas' poetry. I find the work of Douglas to be that of a bored aristocrat with too much time on his hands. In my years of reading, and reading about, poetry I find very little about Douglas' poetry. Murray should have spent less time on what seems to be a defense of Douglas as a literary figure. Lord Douglas was much more interesting as a personality than as a poet."
5,A Bad Reputation Finally Redeemed,"Douglas Murray has done what I had thought impossible - completely humanized Lord Alfred Douglas and made me forgive and love him.Up til now I had regarded Bosie as a monster of selfishness and the nemesis of my idol Oscar Wilde. So great was my distaste for him that in my book collection I would not let his work rest on the same shelf as Wilde's.But this tour de force of a biography, exquisitely researched and crafted without prejudice or partiality, has redeemed the most maligned personality of the Fin de Siecle. Lord Douglas is neither sinner nor saint but merely a man who was his father's son, a fine poet, and a partner in a tragic friendship.This young author is one to watch. His talent is prodigious. I have been a Wilde fanatic for thirty years, and this book shook me. I read every word hungrily, and wept when I finished the final page. Bravo, Douglas Murray! Thank you for ""Bosie""."
2,"This is not an ""Amplified"" antenna!","This antenna works good as far as a ""rabbit ears"" (with UHF loop) goes, but it does not amplify the signal. It has no power input and therefor cannot amplify the signal. The manufacturer's packaging does not indicate that it is amplified and Amazon should not advertise it as being amplified."
2,Not as advertised,"I love Amazon, but this is the first time I feel I was deceived.This product is less than advertised. They're rabbit-ears, period.I have a single antenna mast on a 30 year old B&W; in my shop that pulls stations in better than this item. And you have to change the dial on the antenna to tune in every channel. Now, I need a remote for my antenna."
2,cat trap,The trap is unnecesarily complicated. The key that keeps the door open simply does not work. The door when closed occupies too much space. The back door to put food for the cat once the cat has been trapped is very difficult to open. Quite a dissapointment to think that they made something that could have been much simpler so complicated.
5,easy to use,"I have purchased two of these kits and they are very easy to use and light for any woman to use. One was a gift for someone who is a rescuer , to replace a heavy raccoon trap. I have used it to capture stray cats for spay and release. great product."
1,Havahart back door is not secure,"I used this trap to catch a semi-feral cat so we can adopt it. The trapping part works fine. However the ""backdoor"" is supposedly secured by the bar that acts as the trigger. This is a very poor design. The second time I picked the cage up to take the cat to the vet, the cat slid against the back door, thrashed once or twice and then TA-DA the cat was free.If you trap an animal you can expect that it will thrash around trying to get out. The trap should not have a back door at all. If a back door is necessary it should be secured with a screw and wing nut and not this trigger bar that moves around.Unfortunately I can't recommend this product.Btw...the cat was recaptured and is now at the vet. I used a ""real"" cage to transport him."
4,Worked Perfect,"We were having trouble with stray cats coming into our yard and breeding. The cat population was getting out of control and we were looking for a humane method to capture and relocate the cats. The trap was very effective in attracting, and capturing the cats without any harm to them. The only down side I found to this product was that the assembly instructions were very difficult to follow. Once assembled we were able to capture and relocate the cats one by one until they were all gone."
3,"For the price, It's a good buy..",All the parts are there that you would need. This is not the safest trap if you're going to be catching Mamas with babies because the Mama may go in to see the food and the babies follow behind and when Mama trips the trap it comes down in the middle of a baby's back and breaks it. BUT...it's sturdy enough to withstand 2 large dogs trying desparately to get to the cat inside and it didn't come apart or crush. It saved the cat's life.
4,Feral cat trap,Trap works well but we find that the rear door to the trap is very hard to use. The cover was very handy. The trap door worked very well. I just wish that the rear door was easier to open to relaese the cat. Funnybut we trapped some possums also.
1,SAD WORLD WE LIVE IN.,"This earth was not created for humans alone, but for all living beings and just because humans have taken this earth and divided up into pieces and sold those pieces to each other, it doesn't mean that we own the earth. Other living beings have a right to live on earth as well. Would you find it fair, if someone put you in a trap and relocated you to another land, where everything is unfamiliar and strange to you? We don't have any control over how we are born into this earth, in what form and in what shape, but we all have a right to live our full life terms, on the land we are born on."
3,Frustrating Fun,"This game is an entertaining little dungeon crawl with good graphics, fun characters, and lots of neat little Japanese references. Unfortunately it is also extremely frustrating and that tends to drag down the enjoyment quite a bit.You cannot play this game without getting defeated--many, many times. Each time you are taken down by the baddies you find yourself outside the dungeon minus EVERYTHING you had when you went in or found while you were there. As if it wasn't bad enough that you are doomed to lose that great new sword or item because of the unavoidable traps and foibles of the game, weapons and armor also wear out, often very quickly, often leaving you equipped with whatever junk you manage to find laying around.If you are patient and like a strong Japanese flavor to your RPG's, this game could be a good choice for you. Keep in mind, however, that you will want to smash your DS from time to time as you play, so you might want to keep a spare handy."
3,"Cute, but primitive","It looked cute. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was in love with my new DS and was willing ot give anything a try...The first warning bell went off when the voice over dialogue was in Japanese. A lot of the games I like get their start in Japan, but never before had I played one where they had translated the text but not the voice overs. I began to worry that it was made cheaply in a rush.And then I got my first taste of how gameplay worked. Wasn't thrilled, but I'd spent thirty bucks, so I felt I should play it through. Once I got the hang of it, it was fun for a little bit, but it quickly got tedious.Still haven't finished it, and with the slew of games out there, I probably never will."
4,pretty decent game,pretty decent game for a those that dont mind dying over and over but its a fun game to play
3,Primarily for the uninitiated .,"The book is primarily for the uninitiated. The content does read like a novel, which is not what I expected. It is not a bad book for the eclectic reader, but definitely not recommended as a spring board that dovetails into any serious work on the subject or anything related to the subject."
5,A truly dangerous book!,"However paranoid you are now, this book will multiply it by one hundred-fold! The techniques described can literally make or break a company or political group! If you're smart enough to buy this book andd apply its knowledge, it will give you the COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE EDGE! Not for the faint of heart."
1,"written by either an amateur or a ""fake"" professional","Lots of ""Sex"" from SE Asia, some technically correct ""tradescraft"" items, BUT MOSTLY inaccurate bullsh*** in terms of actual intelligence and counterintelligence methods. I would pay $2.00 JUST to have my intelligence insulted. $23.95 is outrageous to anyone with ANY experience in either field!"
2,Nicholson slips a notch,"I don't know how many horror books the other reviewers have read, but this novel is not all that it's cracked up to be. Ghosts are seen by characters in almost every chapter, so the excitment/terror/impact is lessened greatly. The children in this book seem more intelligent than the adults that supervise them -- doctors included. The real conflict doesn't come into play until 250 pages into the book, and the constant flowery descriptions became tedious very quickly. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved Nicholson's last book, The Manor, but this is one to skip. His next book, The Farm, looks a lot better. If you want a taste of real horror, try Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, or Simon Clark."
2,"Not enough variety, too many crosswords.","So disappointing as i thought that there would be heaps of different ""puzzles"".Wrong!!Crosswords and more crosswords and I hate them so maybe some of my students will too.I would really have liked much more variety,"
4,loved this camera,this camera took really nice pictures in good light..and ok pictures in the dark. Upgraded and decided to go with another brand and have totally regretted that decision. From now on i will stick to the good that i know and buy Nikon.
3,Nikon service is something to be avoided!,"I had my Nikon 3200 for 3 weeks when it malfunctioned. Circuit city would not take it back, so I paid over $10 to ship it to nikon They returned it the last week of September, with more problems than it had when I sent it. After they ignored my two emails, and a letter to the company, I returned it again. As of this date, October 13, 2004, I have not heard form them. DO NOT BUY NIKON... UNLESS YOU WISH TO SPEND YOUR TIME TRYING TO CONTACT THEM!!!"
2,Big mistake by Nikon,"I have had only 2 digital cameras in the past, a Sony and a Pentax, so I still have a short experience.I was told by a work mate how good was nikon 3100. So when 3200 with more options came out I thought to buy it.Now that I have used the camera for 2 weeks I can say that it is very easy to use it has a lot of features but ........with low light condition the pictures are so noisy that are almost uselessSo if you want daylight camera maybe it's for you, but if you are going to use it with low light or flash think in another option.In my case I'm going to send it back to the store.ThanksJulio"
1,Camera Doesn't Hold Up to Light Rain,I got this camera in July 2003 and it took beautiful pictures . The battery door broke at 8 months. I sent it out for repair to Nikon and they took 2 months to fix it. The fix if not under warranty was approximately $150.It was a great point and shoot camera and I loved it until one day my daughter took a picture in the rain and it's never worked again. I paid about $320 for this camera and I feel ripped off.I won't buy another Nikon because my son had a Nikon 2100 that went bad after 1.5 yrs. Don't waste your money.
4,Well worth the price,"As an occasional and novice photographer, I've held off on getting a digital camera simply because I couldn't justify the cost. When circumstances arose that required me to have a digital camera, I set a low budget and checked the Amazon Marketplace. This camera (Nikon Coolpix 3200) is exactly what I need: low price, easy to use, and basic features. I'll have to look into rechargeable batteries, a memory card, and a camera bag, but the basic camera has been just fine thus far."
1,SYSTEM ERROR solution! (temporary),"SYSTEM ERROR solution!? Thank you ""andylong""! I tried your suggestion and it worked! It may be temporary but it is good timing because I'm going to a wedding tonight! At this point, after reading about all the problems everyone is having with Nikon's coolpix cameras, I figured that it couldn't do any harm to try it. Thanks so much! Atleast a temporarily fixed camera is better than a totally useless one.Andy wrote""After weeks of messing about looking for fixes to this problem, I was just about to send my camera back to Nikon for repair (probably not cheap). Before doing so, I let one of the techies at work look at it who has managed to fix it :-* Switch camera on in Auto mode with lens in* Be brave and force the lens as far in as it will go when it tries to extend.* Voila! no more system errors and camera works fine!"""
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory. It had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. For the money I paid for it I was quite displeased and will NEVER buy from them again.
1,"Love Blue Mountain Coffee, Hate JABLUM","While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it. We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee. It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast. We enjoyed that coffee.In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM. You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag. When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt. We were very disappointed."
2,What happened?,"I've had this coffee before and it was fantastic, but... the ""good stuff"" was hand delivered from a friend that was coming home from Jamaica. I don't want to believe the online product is any different (it has the same packaging) but it unfortunately, it was very different. At $50 a pound, you should know what your getting."
2,jablum coffee,This coffee is wonderful but bought it for a gift. the packaging was worn and old ripped at the bottom had to patch it up in order to give was disappointed in packaging.
1,Only 2 of 3 16 oz. received in shipment,"I recently ordered the 16 oz., 3 Pack. When my FedEx order arrived on December 26, 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order. I would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1/3 of my $105 charged price."
3,"Good coffee, but not great","I bought this coffee in Jamaica ($15 for 1 lb bag). While I liked and enjoyed it, I prefer several coffees from my local shops at about the same price. I think that it may have been worth the $15/lb, but no more. Certainly not at these prices."
1,P.U.,I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop?
2,Natural Approach for beginners,"Unfourtunately, after the anticipation was over. I started into the program and found it never really got moving. It was nice to see Joe talk about things and demonstrate some things, but it didn't meet my expectations of Joe Morello. Thought he would of been more technical. For a begineer this could be a good DVD."
3,A Fun Introduction to Informal Japanese Speech,"This book explores some of the more common expressions used in casual speech. Most of these expressions are useful but because the book was published in 1998 some have become obsolete (shigo). Expressions range from everyday chit-chat, to fighting words, to lovers language. I feel this book is an acceptable (and fun) introduction to casual speech for beginning to intermediate students of Japanese (First to Third Year). However, one of the major drawbacks is the complete lack of Japanese characters."
2,Let's be honest. If this is your only book on japanese....,"... you're in serious trouble.The book is filled with one liners and naughty phrases, but it's pretty useless in real world situations. I can guarantee a zero-percent success rate if you can't follow up any of these lines with conversational Japanese... if you can't, it looks like you read the line out of some book- which is bad. However, if you already know Japanese, this book is fun to flip through. I'd probably get it as a gag gift for someone who was visiting japan more than anything."
2,"Don't get this, get Womansword instead","I have to admit, I really detest books along the lines of Making Out inJapanese, which purport to teach you Japanese love-slang, for the simplereason that they are insulting to any reasonable person's intelligence.Womansword, by Kittredge Cherry, is much better. An exhaustive yetapproachable ""pop study"" of Japanese vernacular, this thin, smart bookgoes beyond basic sexual words, and instead takes on words and idiomsthat exist (or once existed) in Japanese, which tell about therelationship of women in Japanese society. Useful for a serious studentas well as for someone looking for some interesting phrases to spring oncute Japanese exchange students.*"
2,tie my shoe[ in collectors condition],"This is an old book and was suposed to be in collectors condition. The spine was broken, the pages yellowed, and the cover has some staines. I was dissapointed in the condition of this book."
2,The picture misrepresents this product.,"I purchased this power cord expecting a very high quality cord with molded plugs as shown in the picture. What was shipped was something I could have made myself with 10' of wire and store bought plug ends. Worse yet some of the screws were left not even screwed in and others were loose and needed tightening.The poor workmanship prompted me to check/secure every screw on the cord and OHM out continuity through each leg before use.Still, I'm left with a cord that has openings around the plug conections for moisture to get into. This may be problematic if you have generator with GFCI protection.They should stop using the picture of the cord with water tight molded plug ends and replace it with the cheaper cord your going to get!"
3,Picture showed a moulded cord,"Seems like a good heavy duty cord, just disappointed that the ends were not moulded as shown in the picture. Ended up returning the cord since I was hoping for something a little bit more weather resistant."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I had previously purchased a 20' GenTran cable and was very satisfied with the quality of it. The photo shown of this 10' cable looked exactly the same so I went ahead and bought it. What I received was a cable with ends that were connected with screw on adapters. This wire remains outdoors and I am concerned that the ends are not water proof. I covered the ends with duct tape, but I would rather have received what is shown in the photo."
1,Useless,"This book is basically just a long list of platitudes, like ""strive for excellence"", ""plan ahead"" and ""be nice to people"". It contains very little of substance and is incredibly superficial.Apart from that, it is poorly organised (apparently every single paragraf deserves to get its own header!), extremely repetitive, and also contains annoying small mistakes (like referring to a reading list which doesn't exist)."
1,No help to me at all.,"This book is very basic and provides only a very abbreviated overview of dock construction. It may help the reader with framing the dock and a materials list but the help stops there. This book provides no specifics on securing the dock, attaching the gangway to land or accomodating fluctuating lake levels. Save your money or you will be disappointed."
1,Dock Designs - Did not help me.,"This book might be okay if you are building a floating dock. I wanted to build a stationary dock and it was of no help. It only detailed building the decking, not the difficult parts -- how to secure in water, etc."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this game, thinking it's an easier game of building hotels, similar to SimCity games, but it isn't. There wasn't any instructions included. So I had to print out 25 pages of it, knowing I'd not remember how to play it very well..that took quite a while. As I played it, I had trouble navigating- the camera moves too fast. I did not understand what I had to do next when I finished the first task I was to do."
3,Returned it,"I wasn't very satisfied with this bear. He was cute enough, but I found him to be on the larger side and it's fur wasn't very soft. Not being soft and cuddly was the deal breaker for me, so I returned him"
5,great product,"I did not own previous DVD Burners prior to buying this drive, so I do not have any real life comparisons. However, I did consult websites, such as www.dvdrhelp.com, which had a bunch of reviews. Based on remarks there, I decided to buy this drive to back up my photographs. (Canon 10D RAW files are 6-9MB each).Installation was simple, but I have prior computer repair experience. However, should be no problem for most. This drive is really remarkable. Not only 8X DVD burning, (works on most 4X media), but also 40X CD-R burning which most other all-in-one drives do not have. The highest I have usually seen while comparison shopping was only 16X.Burning a full 4.7GB DVD+R disc averages around 7 min 30 sec to 8 min 45 sec.The included software, I did not really like. Roxio 6 software was not my taste--too user friendly, with too many start-up programs that appear on your taskbar by the clock. I am using Nero 6.0.19 with no problems."
1,Product Support - Lack of,"Quality appearance of unit is excellent. However, Plextor RMA product support is severly lacking.I own the PX-708A, among three other Plextor drives. The unit failed in less than one year. One year is the warranty period. Plextor RMA department has refused to service the unit under warranty. In addition, they state that they no longer repair their products. Their suggestion was for me to go out and buy another newer drive. Bad, bad advertisement!!The one-star represents product support."
4,Slow but Quality Burning,"I have been nothing but satisfied with my PX-708A. It's error protection technology seems to function flawlessly, but it does slow down the burning process when enabled. If speed is what you are looking for, then look elsewhere. But if a quality, error-free burn is more important to you than speed, then this burner should please you. I have used Mitsui, Sony, and Iomega discs with this burner with no problems at all."
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased Plextor for what I thought was a quality product. However, now after about 18 months of not very heavy use it has failed (I can no longer burn a DVD). So, while it worked better than a previous SONY DVD writer (it never burned a single DVD) the Plextor has not lived up to my expectations. So I cannot recommend it."
2,I want to like this DVD burner...I really do...,"I'm a bit of a technophile and I consider myself to be capable with a PC...and I've yet to be able to get this product to work. I've installed the latest firmware release and have attempted to use a few different DVD burning software apps like Roxio (which comes in the box) and BackUpMyPC. I took the list of Preferred media vendors to the store and bought the exact model number of DVD+R media from TKD (one of six preferred vendors proven to work with this device). No success. This could easily be user error. In fact, my next step is going to be to uninstall everything, hardware and software, and just start from scratch. I really want this thing to work as I've only seen rave reviews...and not just on amazon.com. So, even if it is user error, this has still been a real hastle so that's why I gave it a low number of stars."
1,I'm Still Waiting,"The shipping date for this product states that it ships in 1 to 2 weeks. I have currently been waiting for over 5 weeks for my order to be shipped. I have also been informed that the product has been delayed again and the new estimated shipping date might be another 1 to 2 weeks. This would make my total wait almost 7 weeks for shipping and probably another week for delivery, assuming that it ever gets shipped. I am very disappointed in the estimated shipping date that is posted. If I was given an accurate estimate, I would have ordered a different product. I now feel that I have a certain amount of time invested and feel obligated to wait it out."
3,Not really waht I expected.,I can't really say I liked this mix of disco. I thought it would be more funky. But it's more like the love side of disco. The kind of songs you dedicate to someone you love. Not really my kind of music. Not a dance to mix. Very slow.
1,Don't bother,"This book is not only poorly written, it is also poorly edited. I am not a textile engineer or textile technologist, and I found obvious errors in the first chapters that would actually affect the quality of work anyone using this book would perform. I think that the authors of this book should be ashamed of themselves. I suspect they are professors that needed to be published, and now they are. Their peers should review this book before giving them any credibility."
5,7th Heaven,I'm just happy you were able to get it here for Christmas I looked all over for this product and only found it here.
4,kids love it,"It's not easy finding wholesome clean shows for the kids these days, but this is one show they watch over and over and has good life lessons and values."
4,Thanksgiving 101,A great cookbook for beginners who want to minimize baking and cooking strife for this holiday...Pictures help enormously. Traditional recipes make it a good buy.
4,The T-Giving Basics,"This gives good basic directions for T-Giving, plus enough for a veteran to find it enormously useful."
4,Mazatlan IS Paradise,I have bought every book available about Mazatlan and this is one of the best! Very informative.
2,Not recommended,"I had done my homework on Mazatlan by reading reviews and the forum on TripAdvisor but thought I needed more. Apparently I didn't. The book doesn't deliver and the author, as one reviewer pointed out, is a bit annoying (he claims to be a great negotiator, even at Nordstom's, and has a drinking section even though he is allergic to alcohol).As any travelor can tell you, restaurants change so a published book cannot keep up. And if it doesn't change, the fact it is published in a tourist book certainly will change the clientelle. The rest of the information seemed common sense or found on the internet.Not a lot to glean from this one. Read the forum section of Mazatlan TripAdvisor (hint: the author's contributes to the site) and you will get the answers you need."
4,London Blue Topaz earrings,Purchase and delivery were great. Love the darker blue in the topaz but will give as a gift being they were smaller than I had thought.
3,cubs mlb team logo playing cards,"GREAT PRODUCT AND DELIVERY OF SAME, APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS PRODUCTS. JOSEPH WETZEL"
4,Who Rules Rules!,"I'm a big fan of ""Scene It"" and ""You Don't Know Jack"" and this game was definitely similar to both. Definitely recommended for fans of trivia and game shows."
2,It is a decent game but...,"Intense Games DVD is much more exciting to play, especially if you have really cool friends. This game is a limited version of trivial pursuit that takes way too long to load the questions. The announcer is really funny though.If you are looking for a DVD game that is more well suited for adult players, consider Intense Games DVD. For sale right here at Amazon.com"
4,A browse review,I could not review the book because I have not seen or read it. In any case the cover and the title appear to be very good for particularly employers who may want high productivity from their employees and also for the employees who more often want more responsibility and advancements either in their present posts or to higher ones. The prints (electronic)appear reader-friendly.
2,For non-military audience,"This book is geared towards audiences that have no knowledge whatsoever about asymmetrical warfare. The information I gathered from this book brings absolutely nothing to the fight, but brilliantly and clearly defines the scenario of today's operational environment. It does not possess any practical information on how to negotiate the challenges without completely neglecting current established treaties and policies. One of those ""good to know"" books."
2,"Poor sound, too many buttons","While the clock has a lot of functionality and the intent is good, the the main problem is that the sound quality is poor and if you're like me and want to just hit an easy snooze button, be prepared to hit the small buttons precisely. It projects the time on the ceiling if you use the outdoor weather gauge, which is unobtrusive, but, the clock display turns different colors depending how cold it outside. Under 50 degrees, an intense blue that might keep you awake. Probably fun for children that have no concept of quality."
5,Interesting Clock,"Projection, clock and radio with color clock changing temperatures all rolled into one. For some reason my daughter really likes it and that is all that counts. She is amused on how the clock changes color with the temperature and projects the time on the ceiling. It is also has atomic adjusted time and a pressure trend with a weather forcast. This is almost like a toy for a child, but adults may not like the flimsy design or the sound. Will have to see how this clock holds up over time."
2,"poor reception, poor projection","I was disappointed, having my expectations set by reading their description of the product (and not reviews). The projection time does not rotate very well, does NOT cover the 180 degeress advertised. I have a difficult time capturing radio stations (much worse than my previous 10 year old clock radio)with the remote kept in my car (must stay dry). Time sync is good, mp3 play works well. Alarm is ony 7 day, and not so easy to turn/off, so I get the alarm 7 days a week. A 5 day a week alarm such as is in my phone would be very nice.If it did what it says it does it would be nice, but their sales department seems to be out of sync with their engineering/production departments."
1,Do not Buy,"I was excited to receive this alarm clock in the mail and immediately went to set it up. The display on this clock was broken it was only able to show pieces of the numbers and not the whole number. when i went to set the calendar, the button would not work like they suggested it should of. i had to press it many times until it finally worked. I am very disappointed and its already sent to be returned!"
2,"Some good, some bad",Projection onto ceiling is upside-down and can not be rotated to project correctly. Display is too bright and interferes with ability to sleep. It is difficult to read at night from any distance. Extremely disappointed.
5,This is the best fox trap of all time!,I seen a fox run through my back yard for the 1st time after my folks been told me they seen one in my yard but i didnt believe them. So I bought this trap and it caught the fox on the 1st night! I was sleep and my neighbors called the police from the howling and the animal control came and got it at 1 in the morning. the only problem is that THEY STOLE MY TRAP! and swear they dont have it after they took the fox! THEIVES! so now Im buying another one ASAP!
3,Not quite comparable to a Bridger but its okay.,"The chain was small and it only had one box swivel compared to a Bridger, but overall it seems to be fine. Shipping seemed to take a little long, especially given the state it came from was a state bordering our state."
4,nice trap,"This trap works very well I ordered 15 of them to cut down my carnivore problem. because i raise turkeys, chickens, and pigs on average i would loose about 3 of my animals a week. Excluding my pigs on average I would loose a pig or 2 a year. the morning after I set the traps I found a raccoon, and about a week after that I caught 2 coyotes in one night. I am very satisfied with these traps they are very strong and will hold any animal that steps in them (as long as its foot will fit in the trap and it is anchored properly). I gave this product only 4 stars though because they rust fairly easily. though it doesn't really affect the trap all that much its still has slight inconveniences. but over all another great product from Duke company. and i would highly prefer this trap to anyone with medium game problems."
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is horrable. ive never seen a piece of CRAP like this. the pin to hold the jaws down is a inch 2 short. so i set it up in my building overnight, came back the next morningto work on it, and the piece of CRAP had rusted all to pieces. this item isnt worth the metal thats on it."
1,huggies supreme wipes,these were NOT what was advertised on amazon. the wipes on the computer were huggies supreme lavender and vanilla and i recieved huggies (regular) wipes. amazon did refund my money since the order was wrong.
4,Aci Galatea e Polifemo,"This is one of Handel's earlier works, written 10 years before Acis & Galatea. The singing is excellent throughout and I enjoyed the whole work tremendously. I withheld the fifth star only because I had recently heard a live broadcast on BBC 3, with Charbel Mattar singing the bass part, which to me was better. There is a wonderful bass aria towards the end of the work - Fra l'ombre e gl'orrori - encompassing a range of two and a half octaves - which is the highlight of the work."
5,Excellent book from the cutest chef ever! :D,Jamie's attitude and wit shine through in this wonderful compilation of his great receipes. I can't wait to get the next two books! :)
4,A real Chipper Chappie!,"What a top bloke? Easy, well explained recipes that are the tastiest around, 10 out of 10 for Jamie. Delia will remain my ""Bible"" but I'm more likely to dip into ""Jamie"" for inspiration 21st Century style. BUT, where are the other titles Amazon? This is just not good enough!"
2,Needs a Little Dressing Up,"While the book is a great companion to Oliver's entertaining TV cooking show, the recipes themselves could use a little work. Either he hasn't described the process clearly enough, or the recipes aren't fully formed. A perfect example is the simple roasted chicken. First, you have to figure out exactly what he's asking you to do. Once you get the fresh herbs stuffed into the chicken and pop it into the oven, you're tantalized by the incredible smell. But when the chicken comes out, the flavor is disappointing and even unappealing. Some of the herbs he suggests using leave a nasty, bitter taste. Others simply leave no taste.The recipes in the book give the experienced cook some interesting starting points to jump from, but I think the mixed results might leave a more inexperienced cook discouraged."
4,Rissotto worked at last,"Having watched the TV series, this book was a must. Last night I cooked the Rissotto - My third ever attempt (This time with Jamie at my side) and I'm delighted to say that it tasted great - unlike the previous two occasions. Well done Jamie. ...."
4,Excellent camera.,Originally purchased the spy camera kit and added this later. It's great because you can move it anywhere you want. I put mine in the window to monitor my front door. Very happy with this camera and the WiLife system.
4,"Great, easy to use camera","Wilife, is a fantastic, lo-cost web based security solution for home. The system uses your home's electrical wiring rather than wireless networking which is both simple and more reliable than wireless."
2,"Can't view on ""your"" web site!","Not worth the money.Very easy to install.Can't plug the cameras into a power strip or ups.You can't upload to ""your"" web site.You can only upload to ""their"" web site.This makes these cameras almost useless.Not a good picture quality.Great that the cameras are ""inside"" your home looking out of the window so they can not be messed with. Bad you can't up load the video to ""your own"" web site.If you have no desire to view your cameras over the web, and you don't need power strips or ups great buy.If you want to view your cameras over the web or need power strips don't buy these cameras."
3,Be aware that this CD contains cda files...,"I liked the CD, but the files are saved as ""cda"" files. That means you can't copy the CD to your Ipod or other MP3 player. That limits the amount of time I'll listen to the CD, and seriously makes me consider purchasing other Abney Park disks. Which is a shame, because I like them."
4,Awesome model,this is a awesome model. It was a piece of cake to put it together. Just a little hard to paint.
3,This is more a model than a toy.,Bought for my nine year old son. He was overwhelmed with putting the men together. This would be great foe an active model builder. Great price and fast shipping
4,Good book if you have some knowledge of Hindi,"This book is not for the absolute beginner. Having some knowledge of Hindi helped me. It is a useful book to have in conjunction with an audio software like Rosetta Stone, as it is not very helpful in learning how to pronounce. If you look to this book to become a conversationalist, you will be disappointed."
1,Watchout,I bought the CD only to findout that it does not run on Mac. So buy this only if you have a PC. I was not told that it does not run on Mac. I wish they had made it clear.
1,This is the worst book I've ever read,"The title of this book is utterly misleading. Ms. Odzer goes to Thailand to study women in the sex trade, but she quickly reveals that she is revolted by the work they do and that she is squeamish about stepping into the sex clubs in which they work. Instead, she spends the rest of the book going on about an affair she had with a married Thai man. How angry she is at his wife. How unfairly life is treating her. And on and on. It is boring, not even remotely informative. As a reader, I felt as used as the Thai people with whom Ms. Odzer interacted, and I felt no sympathy or empathy for the author or her actions..."
1,Horrible - Don't waste your money - I'll send you my copy,"This has got to be the worst book ever writen. I lived in Bangkok for 3 1/2 years and know a few of the people that were interviewed in this book. I also am married to a Thai so I take offense to some of the inferences she makes. Don't for one minute feel sorry for the author - falling in love, geting her heart broken,feeling blown off by some of the characters in the book. She used these people just like they used her. She needed to write a book so she exploited them and whatever happened to her she deserved. For the reader JBERNS - I bet after you live in Thailand for more than 3 months, you probably will have a different opinion of this book"
2,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, THE AUTHOR ONLY TALKS OF HER THAI BOYFRIEND","if you want a book dealing specifically with prostitution in thailand, how it is done, and what the prostitutes do, and how they live, this book is not informative enough. this book is a description of the time the author spent in bangkok. more often than not, she does not interviewing prostitutes, and she does not bring you into the lives of these slums. she sees the whole prostitution business in a way that is rather naive. rather, as said before, she spends a lot of time talking about her thai boyfriend and other non-relevant things. she does give some important insight on thai prostitution and the white men involved, but it is very little. read this book like you would a novel. i wouldn't recommend you purchase it for research."
1,Didn't Know It Was So Easy to Get a PhD,"First things first: no one could or would read this book without a prior fascination with Thailand. Which is to say it's awful. But what impressed me most was that such a sloppy, amateurish, ego-ridden, childish and effortless piece of work can get you a PhD, at least in the soft sciences. Maybe ""Dr."" Odzer ain't so dumb after all..."
1,Emotional not Analytical,"What a wasted research opportunity.Academic funding (and I presume a decent supervisor), an extended period for study in the Kingdom and... what interested me the most... a woman's perspective on a subject usually ""sensationalised"" by parachute journalists or men that have arguably lived in Bangkok too long. It could have been so good.This is definitely not ground breaking social anthropology of the Paul Harrison calibre. Rather it comes across as reminisces from an extended vacation cum study trip.If you are looking for an in depth analysis of the Pong, or the intricacies and the drivers behind the sex industry, you are not going to get it here. Leave it on the book shop shelf next to the trash novels written by men attempting to gain closure on their experiences of the Thai bar scene.""Pat Pong Sisters."" Tosh. It's more like ""My Girlie Mates I Met In Pat Pong. And a Fair Bit About the Local Bloke I Fancied."""
3,If only the book would have stayed true to it's title.,"I can't say that I hated this book, but I didn't exactly love it either. The book was a lot more interesting before Cleo fell in love with a pimp. I bought the book because I wanted to learn about the women in the sex trade. I found myself skimming over the boring details of her big love affair. She complained about other people going on and on about their relationships, yet she was the worst offender. Before I lend this book out to my friends I'm going to black out the portions that relate to her embarrassing love affair with Jek. I wish that editor would have done that for me.I still do recomend this book for anyone who has visited or plans to visit Thailand in the future. There is some very interesting information mixed in with the fluff. The book could have been a lot better if the author had stayed with her subject a little bit better."
3,very interesting until she starts in on her relationship wit,"I found this book a very interesting read up to a point. The information about patpong, the sex workers and their trade was very good however, when she gets going about her relationship with Jek the pimp it got really boring really fast.It is easy to tell she grew up rather pampered as she was judgemental about alot of things. Overall i liked the book but it could of been better."
1,Missing the Truth,"I was hoping for a reasoned treatment of the subject, but found instead a book that says more about the author's own lack of perspective than about her alleged subjects. She should have spent more time learning about Thai culture and society before undertaking her study. As it stands, she was a limited observer on a world where she often failed to make basic connections and conclusions that would be readilly apparent to any one who has lived for an extensive period in Thailand. She is more tourest than reasoned observer. If you can get a doctorate for this sort of work, then it can not be much of a degree."
5,A great story to read.,"I really liked this book. I ordered it to get a better understanding of the sex trade in Thailand. But ending up learning more than that. It does provide an idea of how the sex trade is run in Thailand, but I also found the book useful in understand the Thai culture. Finding information, that I never found when reading books about Thailand. I would recommend this book to anyone who might be going to Thailand."
3,not bad,"An interesting read, mostly one which arises from its moral ambiguity (with text and context, subject and object).It seems that many of the reviews here are expecting this to be her doctoral dissertation; the reader should be reminded that this book isn't a dissertation or a thesis - it's a *narrative account* of the time Odzer spent in Bangkok studying her subject. The dissertation itself unfortunately, isn't available [...], but would probably have made equally interesting reading."
1,Disapointing and Superficial,"Though Odzer describes years in Thailand, most of the book focuses on her own *inability* to get any information. She is stonewalled over and over again, but shows no inginuity in exploring the ""World"" she seeks. Lacking any real oportunity for insight--and often being played for a sucker by those she purports to study--the book rarely rises above a boring account of her love life."
4,Interesting read,"This book, however controversial, will interest you whether you admire the author or end up disliking her. Odzer makes bad choices, and seems lovesick over her ""Thai cutie"", but there is an interesting comparison between her relationship with the Thai man and the male ""farangs"" with their Thai girlfriends. Also she neither glamorizes prostitution nor condemns it, and gives a very straightforward account of one of the oldest professions in a very notorious country."
5,"Valuable, insightful work by a competent, qualified researcher.","This controversial book offers numerous insights into the lives of marginalized women in a society characterized by racial and gender discrimination, inequality and injustice. I took it upon myself to search out and read in its entirety a copy of author Cleo Odzer's doctoral dissertation, which draws heavily on relevant and reputable research in the social sciences conducted over many years. The dissertation offers many insights grounded on a solid academic foundation. 'Patpong Sisters' makes reference to some of this research literature, but does NOT purport to be the academic work submitted for the doctorate. Rather it is a work meant for a general audience, and succeeds in its effort to provide informative and illuminating insights into the world of marginalized women workers of the 'demimonde', individuals already consigned to underclass status because of their darker skin and provincial origins."
3,"review of Ritz Camera, not the product","I am unhappy the purchase of this item because i did not receive the eact item i ordered. I ordered the following item: PANASONIC LM-AK60U 2.8GB but instead recieved PANASONIC LM-AF60U. The difference between the two products is that the one i ordered comes with the round disc holder that goes in the video camera and the one i received does not have the holders. I have emailed the company hoping they will rectify the situation to my satisfaction. The item itself is OK b/c it does work with my camera. It's just a pain b/c i have to take a disc holder off another disc to use it in my camera. the thing i am most upset/dissatisfied about is that i feel like Ritz camera falsly advertised the product on amazon. I chose to purchase through amazon b/c the price was so great. Now i know why...bait & switch. Let's see if this gets resolved well. If not, I will be leery ordering from 3rd party companies through Amazon.Thank you,Felicia DiRocco"
4,unique style,I have had multiple comments about the stylish great looks of the watch and that is what made me decide to buy it. It is a heavy watch but that is typical for a Seiko.
4,"Always good for a compliment, but...","you must be extremely careful of the surface, as it is easy to scratch and damage. I work a desk job, and the daily banging around quickly took its toll. I highly encourage an extended warranty to facilitate repairs (i did so with Zales).Don't get em wrong, the large face and assymmetrical profile always get attention, and the weight is much less than you would expect."
4,how muchdance 2002 rocks!,"Hey folks if you liked all the muchdance's in the past years, get a load of this mama muchdance 2002 with hit's from destiny's child(Beyonce Knowles), Nelly, Jagged Edge, City High, P. Diddy, D12, Jamiroquai, Backstreet Boys, Sugar Jones, Joe & Mystikal, Jennifer Lopez and more! If you've bought any of their hits it's like one of the songs of the world around us! All the 2000, 2001 hits put together on a great CD! It's like the 11th wonder of the world, you may not think so but i do so buy it for cheap at any of your local stores but don't blame me if it's sold out!"
2,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS BY BRAUN....,"Have read several other books by Matt Braun and enjoyed most of them. I did not really like this one. Not much in it was the real life of Doc Holliday. It seemed like several chapters were a repeat of the previous one. Doc would get up, dress, go eat breakfast, go play poker, shoot somebody and then go back to his hotel. The next chapter he would be in a different town, get up, dress, go eat breakfast, go play poker, shoot somebody and then go back to his hotel. The towns changed and Doc always had to agree to show up at a hearing the next morning to explain the shooting. Was really disappointed in the book, started just skimming pages as it was so much like previous pages."
3,Good but not the best,"An interesting view of Holliday, but obviously alot of it was made up. You do feel like you know him a little better after reading this book, but don't rely on it as being that factual. It also only covers a brief period of his life -- read the Tanner book for more."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BOOK I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME HISTORIC INSIGHT INTO THE LIFE OF DOC HOLLIDAY. MR. BRAUN HAS PUT TOGETHER A FAIRLY GOOD BOOK OF FICTION. IT IS NOT AN ACCOUNT OF HOLLIDAY'S LIFE, BUT A STORY ABOUT A GUNMAN WHO HAPPENS TO BE NAMED DOC. IT IS GREAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BIT OF OVER SIMPLIFIED READING, OF A MAN WHO WAS MORE INTERESTING IN FACT, THAN HE WAS IN MR. BRAUN'S FICTION."
5,I think this book is definitely worth your time.,"I think this book was outstanding. If you like westerns, you should definitely read this. The book is detailed and it puts you right there by Doc Holliday himself. A must read!"
5,Conan Rocks,"It isn't the Novel that The Dragon Reborn has become. Each book is complete in itself, which is very rewarding for the reader. Yet, each new book brings forth some elements found in previous books. I enjoyed every story. Conan is quick with his blade, wide with his ale, and all arms for his wenches."
3,"ok, not a Jordan masterpiece, but good.","Delivered quickly, as advertised quality. This is a book that is a compilation of three books. It is fairly good, and consistent with the other story lines."
3,Simply JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is not as good as a book as I would like to think being a fan of other Robert jordan books. Simply skip it and go to Wheel of Time.
2,I couldn't put it down. Wish I'd never picked it up.,"There is more chauvinistic macho-ness in this book than I've seen in a while. Some of his descriptions appear to have been written on a long night with only a Roget's and inadequate caffeine for company. One doesn't really get anything out of it, except a glance at how writers can improve a lot with time - because Jordan's Wheel of Time series is so much better."
1,"Hate detest loath abhor despise, you get my drift yet ?",If I say it was a terrible abomination good for a feebleminded dolt it will be the nicest thing i'll ever even utter about this insufferable atrocity.It is a disgrace to RJ legacy I couldn't finish this thing it was so absurd. the pages are not worthy to wipe the bottom of a swampy garbage dump / nuclear waste plant!I love most of RJ's books but this excuse for one had the most dumb insufferable woman crazy self obsessed character ever. The other character is a supposable self-sufficient self reliable high standard not man crazy woman who chases the main characterif that dose not deter you from reading this thing maybe this will it had a really predictable unimaginative plot that I've ever seen since -ever!!One reviewer said its for the younger crowd I beg to differ I really don't think its for a young crowed only an immature crowd. As you have no doubt realized if I could give it ZERO STARS I WOULD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Lost Literature,"My purpose of writing this is not to review Robert Jordan's Conan novel, but to bring to the attention of any who read this the unfortunate lack of the original Conan material in todays market. Conan was created by a man named Robert E. Howard in the 1930's and his original works, are in my opinion, some of the best in American literature. Unfortunatly, whoever has the publishing rights to Conan right now only publishes contemporary Conan novels which are in my opinion, second rate. My recomendation to anyone interested in reading Conan is to go to their local library and see if they have any of the 1960's publishings with the Frank Frazetta covers.However failing in that Robert Jordan is your best bet out of the current Conan authors."
2,"Pulp Conan, not the Conan of old","While I agree with a prior reviewer (who posted 5 stars) that, while THE CONAN CHRONICLES is better than THE WHEEL OF TIME, THE CONAN CHRONICLES does not faithfully reflect nor reproduce the Howard's universe or characters. The negative reviews this book has received are indicative of the latter comparison and most likely, some comparison against all other books in the genre. Some reviewers almost seem to be implying that THE CONAN CHRONICLES is a 5-star book ""for Robert Jordan,"" while some are saying, ""this book is terrible."" I'm in the latter camp; while readable, THE CONAN CHRONICLES is pulp--predictable and repetitious beach-reading not worth re-reading or even continuing to own. My copy will end up at a used-book store.(Oh, and what IS it with Jordan and the ""round breasts"" bit? Jordan's women seem merely the two-dimensional product of puerile fantasy. Has he ever really KNOWN a woman? This becomes almost embarrassing after a few hundred pages.)"
3,"5 STARS, HUH?","Well if this book deserves 5 stars, then please tell me why it is not on any 100 best fantasy books list out there. As a matter of fact, the only Conan novel on a 100 best fantasy books list is THE HOUR OF THE DRAGON (a.k.a. CONAN THE CONQUERER) by Robert E. Howard. By the way, REH is the man who started the whole Conan thing. I found these three Conan stories dark and depressing: evil sorcerers doing all sorts of demonic and satanic things, sacrafices, etc. Sure, Howard wrote the same, but his Conan yarns had the fire of genius in them. Although it is not a novel, read A WITCH SHALL BE BORN by REH. Maybe not one of REH's best Conan short stories, but it definitely has the best chapter on Conan--The Tree of Death. I can imagine you guys giving 5 stars for Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, but not for these Conan stories."
1,read the original,"if you really want to enjoy Conan, read the original by Robert E. Howard. Robert jordan's Conan is boaring and expected."
1,Conan-lite,"After seeing the trailer for the new movie ( I have not seen the film yet) I decided to reread the classic Conan novels that I carried around in my teens and re-read constantly....only to discover they are hard to find...none at either on my local libraries and NO REH books at Barnes and Noble at All! So I checked this out instead and cannot believe how bad, boring, formulaic, and dull it is...the main thing to me is that the Man Himslef Conan does not come across as the intense ultimate bad-ass as he should....even the times when he is fighting or angry it seems kinda ho-humnothing smolders hereAvoid with extreme predjudice...."
3,I was disappointed . . .,"This was a good read, but those who have read Jordan's Wheel of Time series will be frustrated by the thin plots and the simple characters.For an average writer it was a fair book, especially since it was an omnibus, but its not up to par with the Wheel of Time, in terms of both the story and the writing.If you're looking for a good read, read that series instead of this. If you're looking for a no-brainer, then its a pretty good deal"
1,Don't bother!,"As an avid reader of fantasy novels, this series of books was one of the biggest dissapointments ever. It was my first Jordan novel and has put me right off reading any other books of his."
5,Robert E. Howard couldn't have said it better....,"Robert Jordan has managed to capture the spirit of Conan perhaps better than any other author since the originator, Robert E. Howard. The intrigue, the suspense, the unimaginable made believable are all there. There is a difference, however. The bulk of Conan by Mr. Howard was written as an on-going serial. Jordan has extended Conan into full-length novels, giving him more room for exposition and plot-building. The effect is that much more affecting. Read it. It's good"
1,proofreading does it exist?,I have been reading the conan chronicles the books in themselves are okay to read but whoever proofread the ebooks must have been about five years old. on each ebook page I am finding an average of 5 - 6 misspelling it has to be the worst proofreading I have ever seen in my life the publishers should be ashamed to let their ebooks be shown.
5,This book is a MUST!,"This book is written in a splendorous manner, very well illustrated. It makes a voyage throughout the history of man, going through any conceivable place in space and time. It is one of those books that do make you a better person after you read it."
4,"Very good, but don't expect Cosmos","This is one of the first, and one of the better, history of science sorts of series. If you enjoy history and science, then its worth watching. But the program, and to a lesser extent the book, in my mind suffer from a serious flaw: namely; that the author can not seem to divorce himself from his own religious views, which intrude at a number of times in the program. How can I take someone seriously who is speaking about archeological history, while at the same time speculating about the Biblical conquest of Jericho? There is a disconnect here that leaves you wondering. One can always quibble about what major scientific advances are noteworthy, and different authors have seized upon various individuals; but we have in this series nothing out of the ordinary. Looking at ""Cosmos"" or ""The Day the Universe Changed"" is much more fulfilling, from an intellectual standpoint, but its still worth purchasing and enjoying."
1,Creationism Garbage,This book is not science.There is little that is documented by real science. It is nothing but a listing of gadgetry and opinion and represents the hubris of religious creationism.Bronowski is one of the rouge elements in the species man that will not as he claims dominate environment but will kill what sustains the species.The earth will go forward. Life will endure. But if Bronowski's thinking prevails among homo species the species is doomed.
5,On the human aspect and impact of the quest for knowledge,"I grew in my teens watching, rerun after rerun, Jacob Bronowski's TV series ""The Ascent of Man"", from which I took my love for science; science as a very human activity, beautifully described by Mr Bronowski, and his words have well resisted the test of time as I read this book based on the series, and which I inevitably lend to anyone I know who have a thirst for the adventure of knowledge."
5,Toddler cooking,"Loved this book for my kids when toddlers and bought this one for a friend, great information and guidance"
2,"Good recipes, but no pictures & bad layout","I was pretty disappointed with this book, since everyone raves about Annabel Karmel's books. The recipes are fine, but not very exciting. The layout is horrible and doesn't encourage you to use the book at all!"
4,Feed me good healthy food!,"3 children all started eating these recipes as babies... now they are all big kids! We loved this book! It will be packed away with the ""babys firsts"". This is the best way to feed your child. Real food, with real taste, right from the start. The only problem was potential allergy issues."
4,Entertaining and the accompanying audio narrations are great,Excellent script and performances. Beautifully photographed with a laudable soundtrack. The accompanying narrations by Michael Douglas and the director are fascinating and made me appreciate the production even more. This makes the DVD exceptional.
4,Keeps you on your toes.,"Very interesting and exiting, with excellent acting from Gwyneth paltrow. The twists and turns are probably the best thing about it, but why is it priced at 90 $ or something!!!!"
4,A classic story...with a 90's atmosphere.,"Of course this is an updated version of ""Dial M for Murder"" a Hitchcock classic. I enjoy the story and the film sheds some of the film noir stuff used in the B&W film."
4,GWYNETH AND GRACE,"At first i was skeptical about this movie being a sort of remake of DIAL M FOR MURDER.However if GWYNETH PALTROW is not GRACE KELLY,she does a rather fine acting job on her own terms.MICHAEL DOUGLAS's character is a little cold hearted.The fun here is the plot twists that keep you guessing until the end.It's the kind of film you see to kill time but end up saying this is better than a simple time-killer.To resume,i would say that this is a variation of a familiar plot(the best example remains DOUBLE INDEMNITY(1944)that should maintain your interest.I still think that GRACE KELLY was the sexiest blonde in the movies,even if she kept her clothes on."
2,Perfection takes time,"A business man's well off wife is cheating on him and he enacts revenge by hiring her lover to kill her so he can take her money as his business is failing. But the foreigner is not all he seems, he's a former crook and a coward who gets someone else to screw up for him and the whole blows up in everyone's face. Ranges from a poor start to interesting and entertaining to confusing in the same note. The alternate ending takes us back to Paltrow's former HUSH, which no one seemed to like."
5,Surprising!,"This is a great flick, a plot movie that was well thought out and surprising. If you like thrillers you should see it. ..."
4,A Perfect Murder,"A Perfect Murder is a re-make of the Hitchcock film, ""Dial M for Murder."" Steven Taylor, played by Michael Douglas, pays David, an artist played by Viggo Montenson, to kill his wife Emily, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Emily and David are having a affair. The plan seems perfect, but is it? The murder is thwarted and the rules change. There is much suspense, and the plot contains several twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Douglas, Paltrow, and Mortenson do excellent jobs with their roles. The DVD contains commentary by the director and Michael Douglas. It also has an alternate ending that I don't think works as well as the one in the theatrical release. ""A Perfect Murder"" is a very good movie."
5,Chilling,"This is an excellent movie. It's a remake, but done very well. Michael Douglas can play a good bad guy. His wife is Gwenyth Paltrow, and she too is well played. She is having an affair and doesn't know that her husband is on to her. He plots to have her killed and things go 'wrong' from there. It's a gripping story line and has great twists and turns. Any thriller fan will love it. This ranks high on my list of movie thillers I love, and I highly recommend it."
2,I bought this?,"Yes, I bought this! Really mind bending and blowing with how this guy manipulates his wife's thinking. Wonderful suspense and mystery in every minute. Gwyneth Paltrow plays innocense, Michael Doulas plays mystery to the hilt! Get it for yourself."
1,Dial M on a cell phone.,"The butchering of a Hitchcock classic. It was ""perfect"" the first time around as ""Dial 'M' for Murder."" Obviously Hollywood cannot think of anything new and must ruin a classic by adding bad actors and extra sex and violence. I'm glad I waited for video, but sorry I wasted my time."
3,Not so perfect after all,A husband in financial trouble who suspects foul play on the part of his wife hires her lover to kill her in exchange for half a million dollars. The plan quickly goes to hell and the husband tries to get himself out of the way of the law and gets in more trouble with his wife. Very good suspense flick has it's share of flaws but the pros prevail and Paltrow is something else. The attached alternate ending is dehumanizing on the part of Paltrow.
4,a good thriller though,"i'm surprised by the bad reviews because this was a nice little thriller even though it doesn't match the original. I quite like the ending they choose even though if they had picked up the second ending, the title would have been more expressive."
4,By the end you wish they ALL would die!,I was surprised I could like a movie that makes you hate all the characters. No one deserves sympathy which makes for a very original feeling after viewing. Definitely worth seeing. I personally am glad I bought it.
3,Ending was too weak,There wasn't enough suspense and a strong climatic ending that could have this movie shine.
3,Watch your back.,"A Perfect Murder is a great suspense but I still feel like something's lacking from this cat and mouse game. Gwyneth Paltrow saves this film from sinking, she is fabulous, seductive, and connvincing as an unfaithful wife. Michael Douglas tends to over-act here and Viggo Mortensen is a nice piece of eye candy. I like this film but I wasn't jumping for joy, decide for yourself."
3,"Stylish thriller, but falters at the end","A sort-of remake of Dial M for Murder, A Perfect Murder throws in several new twists and turns. While that film was more of a play than a movie, this tells the story of a wealthy New York commodities trader, his trophy wife, and the painter that she is cheating on her husband with. The Upper East Side of New York looks beautiful, and the actors are all good, including Douglas, whose character is a late 90's update of Wall Street's Gordon Gekko. However, the plot twists toward a tired and obvious conclusion. This one had me until the last ten minutes."
3,A Decent Film Does Deliver Good Acting From Michael Douglas.,"a remake of the classic dial m for murder with a little more style and depth. Michael Douglas plays a powerful sucsesful businesman with a younger unfaithful wife who is cheeting on him with a mystroius artist who is really a con man. Douglas finds this out and tries to make a deal with her lover to have her killed, but of course things don`t go as planed and doublecrosses ensure to the point where everyone involed in this twisted game gets what they deserve. Michael douglas as always gives a profesinal convincing performance but Gwyneth Paltrow was far too young and not really all that convincing in her role as the unfaithful wife. But the film does maintain a proper balence of intrigue and suspense throught the enitire film and it comes off very well."
2,Implausable copy of Dial M for Murder,"As a fan of Dial M for Murder, I saw it when it first appeared on British TV. The BBC had a sunday night play program and this was one of the stories. This performance and the earlier movie, 1954, with Grace Kelly and Ray Milland was far better, good music too. Director Hitchcock followed the original story. This new movie has some clever twists but also has some awful gaps and holes. I did not like Michael Douglas as one of the leads. I found him very boring, totally dead sounding and looking, (I guess he didn't like the story either) and unconvincing. Indeed he has a long way to go to catch up with his father. Not a good movie."
2,The movie was great... until the end.,The movie was really interesting... I loved everything... until the end came. The rest of the movie doesn't go along with the ending... and neither does the title.
1,"flat, uninspired thriller","A Perfect Murder falls far from being the perfect film. Or a good thriller for that matter. Other than Michael Douglas the acting in this film is flat. This movie is about a businessman (Michael Douglas) who finds out that his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having an affair with a struggling painter (Viggo Mortenson). Douglas offers to pay Mortenson half a million dollars to kill his wife. If you've seen the trailers and commercials for this film, then you know that part already. The main problem of this movie was that it felt too predictable. We all knew what was going to happen at the end. Another huge problem is that none of the characters in the movie are likeable. They're all corrupt in their own way, even Paltrow's character. A much better thriller is David Fincher's The Game."
3,Visually entertaining...good acting,"I am a big fan of Dial M for Murder. This was a lot different. The part that does not make sense in this one is why, in that very big home, she would answer the phone all the way in the kithen when she was in the bathtub. In 1998, and in that big of a home surely you would have a phone in the master bedroom (which they do, someone uses it later on in the movie). In the original the flat that they lived in in London was pretty small and back then it was usual to have just one phone. Not a biggie just one of those holes that you wished they would have thought of. Visually I enjoyed it because it's always fun to see how people with that kind of wealth live."
2,unexpectedly AWFUL!,Two wonderful stars in one terrible movie!!! How could a movie w/ such a great story line have so many holes in the plot-I was so dissappointed...There isn't much more i can say!
5,Fodor's Vs. Lonely Planet,"I recently traveled in China with Fodor's China. My travel companion had the Lonely Planet. China is not an easy country to get around in, but we found that Fodor's guide was more useful, easier to consult, well organized, and up-to-date. The Lonely Planet was not as well organized and not as updated. If you are planning a trip to China, I highly recommend this entertaining and useful guide."
4,A Good Guide with One Major Flaw,"I recently spent some time in China and happened to have a Fodor's China guide with me. It was extremely informative and quite helpful at times. However, it has one major flaw - the place names of the sites, restaurants, and hotels are written only in English. In order for the average taxi driver to understand where you would like to go, you need to have the name of the place written in Mandarin characters (just in case your heavily accented attempt to speak the language is incomprehensible to the driver). The largest obstacle in a foreign country is always the language barrier. If the guide had the place names written in Mandarin, it would be golden. As is though, it is still worth the money and time to buy and read."
3,Not up to some of the earlier offerings.,"Some years I've finished Year's Best Science Fiction within a week of it being published. This year's edition took me seven months to plod through. That word, ""plod,"" captures the problem I had with the book. Some of the stories in this collection (""A Flock of Birds,"" ""The Potter of Bones,"" ""V.A.O.,"" and ""Turquoise Days"") are over far too soon. Others end up dragging on for weeks (real time). There often just wasn't a spark in them that captured my interest. The overall effect, unfortunately, is a bit leaden. It is, as always, a must for anyone looking for a thorough survey of the year's short SF, but overall I found Hartwell and Cramer's _Year's Best SF 8_ to be a much more enjoyable take on the year."
2,"Sci fi stories, without the science?","In the introduction to this collection, editor Gardner Dozois bemoans the popular perception that sci fi is a genre that is dying. But with weak selections such as these, it's a miracle the genre isnt dead already.If this is the best sci fi can do, then the genre is in alot of trouble. Its a sad day for science fiction when the best stories of the year, contain pitifully little science. In most of the stories, science is none existent, or has a negligable role in the plots (and this even from some so called 'masters' of hard sci fi). Although there were a (very) few gems in this collection, most of the stories are pointless, aimless, lack any kind of meaningfull conclusion, and leave the reader thinking (to paraphrase Simon Cowell) ""Well, so what?""."
5,"Brax - one of the best newcomers in a long, long time","My brother gave me this disc for Christmas. I had already downloaded all of the available songs off of MP3.com. This is one album where if you are not hooked the first time around, you will definitely be hooked the second or third time. The composition and melodic properties of this group are outstanding. This is one group that will rocket to stardom given the opportunity. I would wholeheartedly recomment this album to anyone that enjoys acts such as the Police and other lightly reggae-influenced artists."
1,Bad Music,"This is bad music Do not buy this I have written two reviews for this product before. They have not posted. Do not buy this album. Think Hootie and the Blowfish - with less soul. Empty, sad, and stuck in San Diego. This is the world of BRAX!"
1,Keep shopping,"The best thing about this heater is that Amazon paid its return shipping. The fan turned from loud and annoying to something that sounded like a cat fighting with a chainsaw within the first 10 minutes of use. Max heat output during those 10 min was like the other reviewer said, a light bulb. Will defog your windshield if you are desperate, I don't think it could defrost anything though."
1,week,It was too week it wasn't able to heat the car at all . The fan worked well however no so good I'm the heat.
1,JUNK AND WASTE OF MONEY,"I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled after purchasing this garbage. I can't say enough about how horribly bad it is. You would think the product would be OK for $40.00 dollars, but this product is simply junk. I should have listened to the other reviews before purchasing. The fan is unnervingly loud and sounds like a poorly built electric weed eater....fresh out of the box, and it sounds like it's falling apart. The heat output is slim to none, and even so, it's built-in thermal sensor turns the unit off after 5 minutes...I could go on and on, so just do yourself a favor and save your money!"
1,JUNK,I plugged this into my lighter and blowed fuse after fuse even though i had went up in fuse amps they still blowed. NOT WORTH IT
5,Stuff sure helps!,I started using Optima 365 when my vet rec it. He is an hour round trip so I got it here and will cont to use it and order it from Amazon. My dog sheds much less. The house is cleaner. I also use the Furminator bush also bought on Amazon at terrific savings.
3,"Good product, but...","Hi,I really liked this product but my liking was short-lived because my dog could no longer take it. this product, made my dog sick with gastritis and so I could no longer give this to him..I do not fault the company, they were very concerned and totally understood and they instructed me to call my vet and return the product. I guess my dog was just too sensitive for this product. Again, I do not blame the company!"
5,Great Product,"This is a wonderful product. My dog think she's getting ""something special"" every time I use it. She loves the taste. She is not a picky eater, but has been known to turn her nose up at certain foods. The only problem I have with this product is the smell. As far as my dogs coat... she went from having extreme dandruf to almost none existent! Would strongly recommend this product."
5,Beautiful Work,Very nice modern jewelry. It suited my 20-something sister perfectly. Came in pretty box and velvet bag - easy to wrap.
4,Very nice and light wieght,"Had the necklace, wanted earrings to match. The earrings are a little smaller than the necklace. But still very pretty and light weight."
5,versatile,I bought these to wear with the silver double flower necklace. They are exactly what I wanted. They look feminine & delicate. I will be able wear them pretty much anywhere as they look good for daytime or evening wear
4,A Good Looking Earring,"I bought 3 pairs of earrings where this one came from.I made sure that they were oxidized so they won't tarnish.The makers say that they are tarnish free and just to besure I will keep them in their boxes so that they willlast for a very long time.They are delicate but, pinched the hook a little so that they won't get caught in my clothes or hats and I end up losing them.So far so good - very nice buy for $5."
3,More History Than Memoir,"Too long by at least a third. Like many TV reporters, Mitchell is a bit too impressed by where she's been and who she's interviewed. We don't get enough about her and what she went through as a woman breaking in. The biggest flaw is it reads too much like a popular history of recent events. We already know the facts. What we want is what they meant to Mitchell, but she just drones on, putting fact after fact. That's probably because she's still a working reporter and doesn't want to risk offending anyone she might have to work with. Another explanation is her husband, Alan Greenspan. Saying nasty things about politicians could boomerang for the couple who are among Washington's social elite. Overall, worth a skim."
3,"""Talking Back..."" by Andrea Mitchell","It's TOO LONG! and long winded - with self-aggrandizing along the way artfully scattered throughout. It was a trip down memory lane of the political and world events of the past 30 years - like a mini-history lesson, only more entertaining. When I found myself skipping 20-30 pages at a time, I realized it was time to resell the thing. I started off liking it; then digressed to this. Too many books - so little time! NEXT?!!!!"
4,Interesting read,"If you enjoy a mix of autobiography, history and current events, this book will delight you. Andrea Mitchell covers the American scene through the eyes of a journalist who, as husband of Allen Greenspan, was, at times, participant. Fair and balanced. Goes well with a shade tree and glass of lemonade."
