3,Excellent Film! Crappy DVD!,"I love this film to death. I have seen it enough to nearly recite it word-for-word. The DVD is a wonderful transfer with great sound and picture, BUT...The DVD offers NOTHING but the film itself, a trailer, and spoken dialogue/captions options. I was very annoyed that there were no behind-the-scenes or director commentary. The ""booklet"" was not really anything to speak of either.I feel that a DVD should offer more for the money. When one is presented like this, it should be half the price. Sure, I purchased it - but I'm not pleased.[This refers to the REGULAR EDITION]"
5,Good interpretation of the book!,"Though I'm only halfway through the ""good-parts"" version of the book I saw this movie a couple weeks ago, believe me it was a great interpritation of the book. Buttercup is the most beautiful woman in the world, she falls in love with Wesley, a stable boy on her farm. But when Wesley plans to sail away he never returns, Buttercup is devistated and vows to never love another man again. Which she dosen't. But when Prince Humperdinck purposes to her she agrees. Buttercup dosen't want to marry him but she has no choice. A mysterious twist of events happens when she's kidnapped by three very diffrent men. And a man in black dosen't seem too happy about it.If you love love stories and midevil tales. This is the move for you!"
5,An American classic must see movie!!,"I first saw this movie when I was probably 10 years old. I was hooked. It is such a good movie.I wish they made them like this now a days! It has everything: comedy, drama, fighting, and love!The cast is great too! I own the 20th anniversary edition. It has some cute extras but really you are buying the movie! It is a must have movie for your collection!!!"
5,Funny Funny Funny,"This is one of the most quoted movies of all time because the story is timeless, clean, funny and wonderful."
4,A classic movie that no one should miss!,A classic comedy/fantasy movie that is 100% entertainment. Everyone from my Nephews to my friends love this movie.
5,This is the best movie ever!!!!!!!,"This movie has everything a movie should have; drama, love, action, comedy and just about anything else you could want in it. The movie is one of the best movies ever. Anyone can rely it to be a funny love story."
5,Fabulous movie,"When it was made, it was superb. A classic fairy tale, with swordplay, giants, an evil prince, a beautiful princess, and yes, some kissing."
4,Classic,"I have always loved this movie. My 11 year old daughter and I watched it on new smart, surround sound blu-ray player. It looked and sounded better than ever."
4,A Standard,The standard by which I judge comedy romance pieces by. I watched it with teenagers who loved it as much as I did at their age.
5,The Man in Black,"This purchase was an experience akin to my purchase from Miracle Max. It brought me back to life. I was only mostly dead, though. An for the record, i said, ""to blathe."" Not, ""true love."""
5,The Princess Bride,"Romantic and Adventurous, Wonderful and Perfect, Phenomenal, Cary Elwes and Robin Wright [Penn] shine"
5,"I love this movie soooo much, I bought it for a friend","That's right! I love this movie. Everybody I know loves this movie. If you want to give a friend a gift, then give them this movie.Princess Bride is bright and funny. Good clean movie watching for all ages. Want to watch a movie with your parents (this is it!).Buy this movie if you want to smile and giggle!"
5,"Amazon, the Blu-Ray version of The Princess Bride was never released. Please DELETE this web page.","This movie is a classic, and as of January 2009, it STILL has never been released as a Blu-Ray disc. So, Amazon.com, why don't you take it the hell out of your product catalog until it is actually available to those that want to buy it?Just do it."
1,The Princess Blunder,"I ordered the Princess Bride for a Christmas and it didn't work in any DVD player. I tried several to make sure it wasn't the player. It can't be returned because once I opened the package it was unrefundable. So, I'm stuck with it and just ordered a second one."
1,Princes Bride Anniversary Edition,"The movie itself is a great one...But...the DVD has scratches makes the movie skipp!!! I have no idea, without a mess of trouble how to get a new one now...at my local video store I could have just traded it in!!"
1,This movie sucks and I mean it...anyone want a peanut,"When this movie begins a young boy is concerned that this movie is a kissing movie. But he is assured it is not by his grandpa. Unfortunately the granpa is wrong, this movie is undoubtedly ""a kissing movie"". That is just one of the many problems witht the movie. Most importantly there is the pathetic supposed to be funny but greatly failing humor and script. This includes the very annoying line. ""no more rhyming I mean it! Anyone want a peanut?"" I mean seriously that is not funny. There is also the horrible effects. It is amazing that this movie was made in 1987 because I would have guessed it was made in 1960. Between mechanical rodents, kissing, kissing, kissing, peanuts, and Indigo Montoya's fathers death this movie is bad."
1,This movie hurt to watch,"This movie bothers me and I really mean it... anybody want a peanut? I particularly sick of hearing that phrase over and over again along with many others. If this movie could fall off the face of the earth, I wouldn't cry."
1,Avoid this movie at all costs.,"The most annoying collection of bad jokes/puns/gags ever seen on celluloid. The humor is dry, at best, and vaguely vaudvillian. And if Buttercup has perfect breasts, them I'm Rod Steiger. Could someone please let me know who decided to give Andre the Giant a speaking role? The only remotely redeeming scene is the Wesley/Montoya swordplay, and it too is a bit tedious. The fact that this movie was even released is inconceivable."
1,Not really worth seeing,"This movie is, I am sorry to say, not really worth seeing. The only could thing about it is Cary Elwes, who is VERY CUTE. But aside from him I really would not reccomend this movie. Unless you are into severe human torture."
1,EXCRUCIATINGLY BORING -- A TIRED FAIRY TALE,You don't need Sominex or any other sleeping pill if you are having trouble falling asleep. Just watch this excruciatingly boring film instead. You'll be catching those zzz's before 30 minutes elapse. This is one very boring movie.
5,The Princess Bride,"This is one of my top ten all-time favorites! I've lost count of how many times I've watched it. The book is also excellent. It's got everything packed into it--romance, action, comedy--and everyone from young to old will enjoy it. Even with new movies coming and going, this one remains within the top ten! I recommend it to everyone--you won't be disappointed!"
5,A classic,"It's refreshing to watch a real romance movie these days without the soft-porn sex scenes and real, genuine, witty writing. A must for any DVD library."
4,"Yes, it is well worth the price......","Princess Bride is a classis love story told in an unusual manner. With giants, sword fights, dread pirates, true love and all the right people playing thier parts perfectly, this is one of the finest storys (8+yrs and older) I have ever seen."
5,"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya","This is seriously almost the funniest movie ever made. I love it. I am fourteen years old, and I have probably seen the movie five times without getting tired of it. ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die."" ""Mawwage. Mawwage is what bwings uus togethew, todaw."" SEE THIS MOVIE!! I love it love it love it."
3,Great Family Movie,This is a timeless classic! My husband introduced me to it and now I watch it when he's away. This is great family fun and a really cute movie!
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD (even though the movie rocks!),"This DVD's anti-piracy technology is as dumb as a doorstop. I get the green screen when trying to play my LEGALLY-PURCHASED DVD on an average DVD player hooked up to an average LCD TV. Since there is no way for a consumer to know whether this DVD will play on their home system, the best bet is to AVOID IT ALTOGETHER and read the book instead, or watch some previous DVD release that isn't tainted with this ANTI-CONSUMER technology.That said, this is an awesome movie. Too bad the people who own it have decided that we're all criminals."
2,"Movie great, but dvd came damaged","I ordered this special edition dvd because I absolutely love The Princess Bride. But when the package finally arrived in the bubblewrap-lined manila envelope, there was noticeable damage.Specifically, I hole in the corner and wrinkling on the envelope, like it had been man-handled. I guess I didn't think much of it and took it home. When I actually opened the package, I saw that the corner of the box that encloses the dvd was damaged, and that the plastic lining the dvd cover looked warped. The only reason I didn't return it and demand my money back was because I am currently stationed overseas and don't really have access to send packages. I feel like for the price (almost $50), and the fact that it's ""new"", I expected mint quality....very disappointed, still love the dvd....just not the box it came in =("
1,dvd did not play correctly,"Evidently got a damaged dvd, skipped entire sections of the movie, would break up in the middle of several scenes."
1,What is the big deal?,"The book is so much better than this crummy movie, which is ruined by having Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, and Billy Crystal working very very very hard to be very very cute.Silly, sentimental, and never as clever as it thinks it is. This is a movie for people who are seriously, deeply, truly moved by telephone commercials."
1,POOR-SUBSTITUTE,"the labyrinth is better, but since it is out of print, this can be a poor substitute"
1,Read the book,"The book is a MILLION times better than the movie. They left so much out and it really made me dissapointed when I finally saw the movie. Don't waste your money on the movie, but i recommend reading the book."
4,Dread Pirate Edition Review,"The special features could have been put together better, it didn't seem to me that much thought went into them. And they really weren't as interesting as I hoped they would be. I might as well have just bought the regular DVD. But it was nice to see the special features, though I'm sure I could have found them uploaded online somewhere and saved some money. I give it four stars because I love the movie, and I am glad to have it on DVD. And it is a nice addition to my Bride collection. I don't mean to sound really negative, I do enjoy this purchase, it just could have been better."
5,The Princess Bride is the BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"Wow! I have to say this has to be the best movie!! It has everything anyone could ever want out of a movie!!! The acting is wonderful. (Could Cary Elwes BE any more HOT?!?!) The story is one of the best I have ever heard. I think it was totally clever for William Goldman to use Morgenstern in the movie and then write the book with Morgenstern as the 'original' author. I would, however, suggest that you buy the Special Edition of the dvd rather than this version. It has absolutly no special features (okay it has the theatrical trailor, but nothing else!!!). I can't wait to get the book, the cd, and the special edition dvd! I love the talk of true love in the film. It is just so beautiful the way that Elwes (Westly) and Wright (Buttercup) portrayed these characters. They come off as if they are a young couple totally enamored with each other. This has to be one, if not the greatest, film of all time in my opinion!!!"
5,A Royal Romance,"My mom got this movie when I was just a kid. And I accidently left it in the VCR when they took it back to the store because it broke. I spent two weeks doing odd jobs for my family and neighbors saving the money to buy another 'Princess Bride' That's how much I loved that movie then, and I love it just as much today. Watch it, and I'm sure you'll love it too."
1,Blu-Ray Audio does not work,"I'm very disapointed in this product. It comes in 2 disks, and the regular disk works fine, but the English Audio does not play in DOlby surround on the Blu-Ray DVD. All of the other languages play, but I don't want to watch it in French or Spanish! I have played numerous Blu-Ray DVD's on my player and have never had a problem, until this one. And I didn't try to play it until a DAY after my return policy expired."
5,Bravo!,"This was just the greatest movie!! It had everything: romance, action, and, of course, comedy! My favorite line in the movie is ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoyo. You killed my father. Prepare to die!"" This movie made me a huge Robin Wright and Cary Elwes fan."
5,Among My Top 5,"This is by far one of the best movies made in the 80's. It has everything, just like Peter Faulk says, ""fencing, fighting..."" I love this film."
2,The Princess Bride,The CD had numerous skips throughout the movie - finally had to stop the movie as it was too frustrating to view.
3,cute,"I liked the Princess Bride, but it's not a great film. Light entertainment! Kind of corny, with some good suspense."
5,One of our favorites!,our whole family loves this movie. my wife and I remember seeing it in the theatre.the kids only recently were introduced. all of us quote lines from this film.
5,One of the best movies ever!!!,"One of the best movies ever made! The story, the language! All wonderful characters. From beginning to end you laugh and cry!"
5,A Great Movie,This has been a family favorite since it was released in the theatres and one that is quoted many time. Our old VHS was worn out and it was great to see this on Amazon for a great price so we could get a Blu-ray.
5,Family favorite,"Great family movie, we have watched it 50 times!A true classic we all enjoy watching together, we know all the lines by heart"
3,"Movie is awesome, HD-streaming was problematic","Love this movie; our whole family does. Perfect for my two girls, ages 9 and 12. We went with the HD version instead of Standard Definition. That was a mistake. We've never had any problem streaming standard def. movies from Amazon. This was the first HD movie we tried. It played fine for about an hour (on a Friday night). Then, it began to ""stall"" and had to re-buffer multiple times, probably every 3 to 4 minutes, until the end of the movie. I guess we'll go back to renting standard def movies. Not sure if it was Amazon's problem, or our internet provider, but we have a very fast broadband connection, so I didn't expect to have such problems."
5,True Opinion on an Amazing Movie,"I first saw this movie in grade four at school. I was ENTHRALLED. It is soooo amazingly good. Whoever thinks it's boring must not have enough intellect to see the wonderful points in this video. It is so romantic, yet funny, yet...well once you see it you'll understand. This one is a classic."
5,for all ages,"""Inconceivable."" A movie that that truly can be viewed multiple times with and by kids of all ages. Have watched this film with my sons on their birthdays for the past ten years and it is a constant delight. Something for everyone. A treasure not to be missed."
4,Great Movie,"Classic movie, filled a with action, adventure, romance and comedy. The DVD transfer is good, but the movie lacks extras!"
4,"Hilarious, witty humor abounds","This movie is a cult classic. It's unique form of humor will leave an impression on anyone. Great movie, highly recommend."
5,Perfect,"It is simple, lovely, perfect for any audience. Just a lovely little fairy tale short sweet and to the point."
5,princess bride,"Although I will admit that this film is pretty cheesy, it's the camp that makes it. I watched it with my daughter and girlfriend, neither of whom had seen it before. My 8 year old daughter was quite skeptical about it, since it was almost as old as Daddy, but after she gave it a shot she really liked it. It's a timeless tale of true love and all that, plus it's funny to see Fred Savage looking pretty much the same as he does now..."
5,Awesome Deal on an Awesome Movie,"I can't speak for what special features are on this disc that are or aren't on other discs, but I can say that the current price of this movie (less than $7) is an incredible bargain for one of my all-time favorite movies! If you haven't seen this movie yet or read the book - I will just say that it has a little bit of everything that makes a movie great - romance, comedy, action, suspense, drama... ""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles..."" It also boasts a cast of incredible actors from Cary Elwes to Mandy Patinkin, a young Fred Savage, Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn and more. I'd call this one a MUST SEE."
2,Princess Bride DVD a Disappointment,"Years into the DVD revolution, it's disappointing that a studio would release such a poor product. The digital transfer was, at best, below average. The print which was transferred shows its age and it appears that no attempt to find one with vibrant colors was made. For several minutes I thought I was watching a Chinese import.Also disappointing is the lack of a director commentary, behind the scenes material, or even cast information. THIS IS A SPARTAN, CHEAP PRODUCT!Save your money, for now, until a better version comes along."
4,Super fun movie -- one of the classics of all time!,"Great puns, super cast, well-paced and funny! Just right for a good laugh on a Sunday evening. It's kid-friendly, too!"
3,Swearing TOTALLY unnecessary,"It's not that the movie doesn't have redeeming moments, and it's mostly a fun watch, however, right near the end one character said ""you s.o.b"" (except without the initials). I found that line of dialog ruinous. For me, a PG movie with no warning of foul language should nave none. Though I realize we are not in Disneyland, to me it was extraneous and totally unnecessary. Yes, I'd have kept the DVD for our family library, were it not for that flaw. To me, it was a fatal one.Otherwise, or if you have a higher tolerance for foul language than I, the movie is a rip-snorting laugh-fest."
2,Shoot me now,"I would have given this one star, because this movie drives me up the wall like no other. Maybe it was because my sister used to watch it all the time when she was like fourteen to eighteen. Even the best movie can be destroyed that way, and this was never good in the first place even. I think I could have nightmares about this movie, it's that bad. The acting is terrible, and it's completely fake. The princess's tumble down the hill after her love is incredibly retarded. Coming from someone who is usually a fan of stupid movies, that's pretty bad, because that puts this movie at the point of beyond stupid. If you want to see a movie that makes ""Napoleon Dynamite"" look like it has the greatest plot ever and is the most intelligent movie ever written, I guess you should watch this one. Yet,why would anyone want to watch this movie more than one time in their whole life?"
1,I REALLY HATE THIS MOVIE,For years now I have wondered why people think this movie is so wonderful. It is not funny and the whole movie is just stupid. It is time the truth came out. This movie is pathetic as are the performances by the actors.
2,Torturiffic - not for the children,"Gosh--I know this is a classic for people of a certain generation, but still--it is, on the whole--awful, and it is NOT for children.The love story at the end does not redeem the nauseating scenes of drawn-out torture of the hero.The giant's speech is utterly incoherent.Billy Crystal and Carol Kane perform the most unfunny Jewish old folks stereotypes in decades.Sorry--but I just don't get why this is so cherished by some. It is cringeworthy on many levels, you'll just be waiting an eternity for some scenes to be OVER, already.And the lack of extras on the DVD doesn't justify the DVD price.Caution--if you believe this is a kids' movie...it really isn't."
1,People find this FUNNY?,"I've had to sit/sleep/complain my way through this thing two times more than I should have. (I've seen this movie, oddly enough, twice) I can't comprehend why so many people find this sort of low-brow humor amusing. (I guess the same geniouses who went to see Dumb and Dumber) I really hated that short little snot whose only claim to fame was being on Murphey Brown. (whoop) The quality of direction sort of reminds me of something I could have done with a home video camera, a bath tub, and a couple of toy boats. (I mean, come on! How many of you REALLY believed that was a full-sized ship they showed during the water scenes? Raise your hands please :::::silence::::: I thought not.)"
4,"Great title, great family film","A timeless classic and chock full of extras. This movie is one of my favorites from childhood. My kids really enjoyed this film too, brought some extra excitement to our tv dinners. This film will be among the favorites for generations to come."
3,Read the Book!!!!,"I read the book before I watched the movie which always makes the book better, but I would recomend reading the book and not watching the movie. The Princess Bride by Goldman is one of my favorite books. The paragraph summing up the book in the first couple pages is the best. If you have already seen the movie go read the book. You might be surprized."
5,MY FAVORITE MOVIE!,"My college roomates hated me because I forced them to watch this movie about twice a week. It is my all-time favorite movie! This adult fairy tale is a beautiful love story as well as an action-adventure comedy. Having a bit of everything, you will not be bored for one second. And each time I watch it, I notice something new. I will never tire of watching this amazing film. WATCH IT!"
3,Don't read the book before you see the movie,"This story is William Goldmans classic - A Story of True Love Filled With Swashbuckling Pirates, Bad Guys, Good Guys and Beautiful Woman.I did read the book a long time before ever seeing the movie and I missed one of the most important parts of the story - the wonderful chatty narrators voice. Without this, some of the best humor of the story is lost - the story of all the other best kisses in the world, the other beutiful women, the story of Bella, the wicked stepmother and on and on. However it is understandable that this is difficult to reproduce.On the whole it is a nice adaptation, Cary Elwes does a nice Errol Flynn impression, Robin Wright is suitably lovely and Mandy Patinkin is excellent as Inigo Montoya. Billy Crystal also does a nice turn as Miracle Max.My advice would be to see the film, enjoy it for what it is and then read the book to get the full benefit of William Goldmans voice."
3,Best message I know regarding the pleasure of books .,"Packed with cliches, beauty, wit, and after many viewings I still find the interchanges between the reading narrator (Mr Falk) and his ill? grandson tremendously moving and superbly acted and directed. The final line of the film spoken by Mr Falk ""As you wish"", in the context of the film, says more about love of grandparents for their grandchildren or indeed, the love of adults for children as they take off on their journey into the world of books and the imagination, than just about anything I know. There is much fun in between of course with great comic actors relishing the wit of the script. Much fun. Pure pleasure. To own and revisit from time to time."
1,Bad Re-Release,"Not sure why Amazon insists on not printing this review, but I'll write it and say it again. For all of you DVD collectors who are fed up with these re-re-releases, write to MGM and the other movie companies, tell them you're sick of it, and tell them you aren't buying their products anymore. There's no reason this, Patton, The Magnificent Seven, Airplane... just to name a few, should be reissued, with one or two little stupid extras. If the consumers are playing fair, why shouldn't these companies? After all, they have the gall to put ads against piracy before the movies on some of their DVD's? Now they know why some people are doing this. They're not playing fair. Email them, and let them know."
5,BEYOND A DOUBT - A CLASSIC,"Each time I watch this movie, it seems to get better. I watched it with my teen children years ago and now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandchildren. It has lost none of it's charm. This is one of those movies that both children and adults can appreciate. I highly recommend you add this one to your collection."
5,Great Movie,"My family has enjoyed this movie for years and I was excited to get it on dvd in the anniversary edition. The interviews and anecdotes from the stars are great fun and of course the movie itself will never grow old. A truly classic story. So ""have fun storming the castle"" and get this movie. You won't be disappointed."
4,Good movie.clever...,Good movie..smart..entertaining..It will keep you interested and intrigued.worthy of our precious time..enjoy. I am busy so..I don't have time to ramble..just watch it..
4,A Grand Story of True Love and High Adventure,"A labour of love by one of the greatest film writers of our time, William Goldman (Marathon Man, Maverick, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). I love this film in its lightheartedness, romance, and humour. The only reason I give it a mere four stars out of five is because the book, which was abridged by William Goldman from S. Morgenstern's original, was vastly superior (and anyone who likes the movie ought to read it). As a movie alone, however, it is excellent for fans of comedy and swashbuckling fun."
5,Excellent Movie,"This movie is funny, sad, and everything else. It has humor, swordfighting, and many wonderfull characters. The best part, I think, is the humor, I think it is one of the funniest movies. So if you like funny movies get this movie."
5,The Princess Bride is the best!,"This is my all time favorite movie (though the book is even better!) This movie has it all, love and romance, giants and strange creatures, swordfighting, comedy and tragedy, wonderful costumes, beauty and ugliness, lots of famous actors, clever dialog, and a great ending. It's a movie for the whole family. I'd recommend this movie to anyone and have bought it for other people."
5,The Princess Bride,"A family classic. Perfectly cast. A refreshing escape from Michael Eisner's marketing vehicles thinly disguised as family entertainment. Unadulterated good clean fun. A wonderful mix of drama, comedy, campiness, and action, gently and warmly blended; curiously touching. All this and an absolutely scintillating sword fight that will knock your SOCKS off, perhaps the best I've ever seen."
4,As You Wish,"The new special edition costs twice as much for ""special features"" that should have been included in the first place. I say forget that. One of the few films of wonder that satisfies the whole family (I know one family which used to sit around and watch this on VHS, quoting every ""fun"" line) without showing any naughty bits or using naughty language. Casting this ensemble alone was a work of genius. So, when you get home tonight, having been climbing the Cliffs of Insanity, do yourself a favor and get this one. It's also a good ""guilty pleasure"" film for the collection of the single man. I should know."
4,"""Classic Reiner Fairytale!""","Cary Elwes and more star in Rob Reiner's 1987 fantasy.A sick boy's grandfather reads him a story filled withromance and adventure. I've always liked this filmand this dvd has nice picture and sound, but I wishit had extras from the previous one on here too.I recommend this classic fairytale that's one ofReiner's best."
5,A Classic and great fun,"I got this movie on ""Black Friday"" for $4. This movie is worth any price.Though this movie was made over 20 years ago as of this review, it never feels dated. The effects are cheesy, the dialogue is at times silly but witty, and the plot is simple. And, it all works. This movie never took itself seriously. When one watches it, the actors and actresses seem to be more at play and less at work. The cast is amazing but even as goofy and oddball as the movie; Fred Savage (Wonder Years), Peter Falk (Columbo), Cary Elwes, Chris Sarandon, Billy Crystal, Andre the Giant and more. The plot is a simple boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy goes on a quest to find girl and its all from the perspective of a grandfather reading his grandson s storybook fairytale.This movie is pure fun. With a stessful world we all live in, fun is priceless."
5,"Best kids' movie ever, and fun for adults too","Simply the best kids' movie ever. It has lots of adventure, interesting characters, and beautiful scenery and sets. It is decidedly not saccharine. It has plenty of appeal for adults as well, but without all the sleazy double entendres. I loathe Disney movies because they are so uniformly Royalist sub-textually, so it's an added delight that, despite the title, it's about a couple of commoners. My 10 year-old son didn't want to watch it because - hey - the title has both _princess_ and _bride_ in it, but asked to see it a second time the next day, and declared it is the second-best movie he's seen, right after ""Up""."
3,Princess Bride,Classic Tale and very enjoyable heard about this film for years glad I got to see this film. Holds up well after 25 years
4,Princess Bride Anniversary Edition,This is a great movie. It's an ageless classic for the entire family.The cast is awesome and Peter Falk was terrific as the Grandfather.
5,Storybook Love,"Come my love, I'll tell you a tale. A tale with fencing, fighting, giants, miracles, and the kind of true love only found in storybook stories.The Princess Bride is one of the best, if not THE best movie I've ever seen, and this blu-ray version is just as wonderous as the VHS tapes I grew up watching. The movie transferred well enough from film to high-def, and the special features included are entertaining, interesting, and serve to make the experience all the more memorable. This was my first blu-ray purchase, and I couldn't be more satisfied, or more in love, with it.If you've never seen this movie, and you've ever once believed in true love, then I couldn't recommend anything more than to watch it at least once, and let yourself believe again that true love really is the greatest thing in the world (except for a nice MLT)."
2,"GREAT Movie, but this DVD is nothing new","First, I of course do LOVE this movie and if you don't already have another copy of this movie, then definitely buy this DVD. BUT, if you've already got the 2001 ""Special Edition"", then this June 13, 2006 rerelease is a rip-off. The only thing new on it appears to the Dread Pirate Roberts mocumentary and some stupid game."
2,"Fantastic movie, disappointing DVD.","First off, I LOVE ""The Princess Bride"". It is a fantastic movie that is timeless. But the DVD is deplorable.The 20th Anniversary Edition falls short. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because of the fact that the movie is on the DVD, at least. Am I crazy for thinking that for the 20th Edition all the extras on the past DVDs should be able to make it onto the ultra anniversary edition? There are a few select special features, but nothing to shake a stick at. The behind the scenes and everything from the past few editions are all gone and that's ridiculous!I would reccommend the original Special Edition if you want to get the most out of the DVD. That one at least has the best Special Features. But, until they decide to treat ""The Princess Bride""'s fans right and put everything into one compilation, don't bother throwing your money at the DVD. Hopefully they will do it right just in time for the 25th anniversary."
3,"Great movie, so-so DVD","OK, you've seen 368 reviews saying this is an outstanding movie. I don't want this review to add to that list; this movie is one of my all-time favorites and I can quote most of the lines from the movie.But what I do want to recommend is that you wait a little while. There have been persistent rumors that MGM will be releasing a special edition of this movie, with extra features and commentary from director Rob Reiner in the first half of 2001.I don't know about you, but there's nothing than frustrates me more than having to buy a movie twice because of this type of action on the part of the studio."
5,Classic,For me this one is a classic. I remember watching this one when I was just a kid. If you haven't seen this yet then your missing out.
5,The Best Love Story EVER!!!,"My husband and I saw this move in 1990 before we were even dating. The first time he told me he loved me was at a friends house when I asked him to pass the peas. His response was as you wish!This is a great,funny,heartwarming film good for the whole family. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.P.S. We've been married 16 years now."
3,Better than the book,"The reason I say it's better than the book is because it was written for an American audience. The book was originally written in a different country and in a different language. While the movie closely follows the book, leaving out some tedious parts, it injects humor into it as well. This is the movie that made me fall in love with Cary Elwes."
5,All time favorite!,"Just to state the staying power of this film, I recently attended a sci-fi-fantasy convention, where I picked up one of those ""Hello"" name tags. It was already filled in. It said:HELLO my name isINIGO MONTOYA. YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO DIE.They had sold like hotcakes! I was lucky to get the second-to-last one! They say, above, that this movie was released in 1986, sold on video in 1987. I find, therefore, that time has flown. It hasn't aged a day. It's a delight and always will be, for anyone with a sense of fantasy and a sense of humor! In fact, it's a sort of litmus test movie for me...if you saw it and DIDN'T like it, you won't like me.Regardless of your age, if you have a wry but hopeful outlook on life, and a happy disposition in general, you're going to love this. A great family film!"
5,brilliant and demented,"This movie is full of all kinds of comedy: character, verbal, visual, and just plain slapstick. It's laugh 'til you cry funny. The funniest ever performances by Wallace Shawn and Billy Crystal. Do yourself a favor and watch it!"
5,Best Love Story Ever!!,"From the very first time I saw this movie in 1987, it has been my favorite. I am now twenty eight. Me and my daughter can sit and watch it over and over again. Wonderful movie to share. This is a classic in my book!!! A fantastic story of ones True Love. I can recite every word of it, and it never gets old. If your looking for really good romantic, funny and inspiring movie of love...this is the one to get!!!!"
5,What A great fantasy Movie!,This is a great fantasy movie. It is hilarious and it has great acting. This movie also has a happy ending which makes it a great fantasy movie. Released the 25th of September 1987 this movie grossed 30 million dollars. I think it should have grossed more because it had good acting and was really funny. The DVD translation was great to Widescreen it made me feel like I was watching it in the movies. I recomend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy movies and is highly recomended to children. If you like this movie try Labyrinth(1986).
5,DVD is MONO?,"Like the rest of the reviewers, I loved the movie and the book it was based on. But why is the DVD being released with a MONO soundtrack? That is totally WRONG! :( I'm going to wait for the ""special edition""..."
4,lots of fun,"I would probably give this 5 stars had I not seen this film so many times that its charm has worn a bit thin. This is an excellent film for the entire family. The jokes are clean, though mostly geared toward adults, but there is more than enough swashbuckling action and basic humor to entertain the kiddies. For those with kids, it's a good DVD to invest in, particularly if you're tired of watching The Land Before Time Part 28 and would like to enjoy the same movies your kids do."
4,Beautiful movie,"Liked it a lot beautiful movie. The movie played well and the quality of the picture was great, will order more movies in the future."
4,Romantic Comedy,"Great movie. Overcoming great obstacles to reunite with your true love. Comic relief makes it light, but it's still a great story."
5,Classic!,This movie is a classic. The cast to the story line. Very funny and romantic somewhat goofy. So glad to get the 25th anniversary copy :-D
2,Its Not blue ray,Both the Cds that came in the box are DVD quality and neither of them are blue ray. Even going by DVD quality they are not that good.
5,Classic everyone will enjoy,"This is a must see feature presentation film. action, romance, plot and character development. The only thing missing is the popcorn!"
4,Movie: 10; Special Features: 5,"I'm glad I got the movie; not many movies are better.Special features were good, not great. If I had to do it again, I'd research more and maybe get a different edition."
5,"Awesome, but Read the Book, Too.","William Goldman's novel The Princess Bride is absolutely one of the most fantastic novels ever written. It is, at the same time, something of a satire on the fairy tale--lamenting the lack of fairness, the failures of love that occur in life--and a wonderful fairy tale, too, setting out the ideals of these stories that have guided us for so long. It's a beautiful book, funnier and deeper than the film.But this movie's pretty dang good, too. The casting is perfect all-around. Cary Elwes especially is underrated. The story is archetypal, connecting on a deep level with so many people. Plus it's funny, with subtleties of humor that you'll be catching through multiple viewings. It captures many of the best aspects of the novel, though it can't match it."
5,not really reviewed,"We ordered this delightful film as a gift for our grandchildren.Having seen it many times we Knew what we were getting.The only thing was it never came . Amazon has some suppliers who do not live up to their high standards. This movie was supposedly shipped in October. it is not here yet.Beware of vendors who ship DHL Express. the items take forever to arrive ,if they come at all.Amazon refunded our money with no problems and an apology.By the way the girls were thrilled with the movie which we obtained locally for a much higher price than Amazon."
5,A great movie...now on Blu-ray,This has always been a great movie. This special edition includes commentary by many of the actors discussing the shoot and what a great time it was. A good story....enjoyable entertainment for the entire family!
4,best quotes of all time,"this movie has some excellent quotes that everyone should try to learn so your ""coolness"" factor could hit the skies.ok, really a very funny movie."
5,Don't let the Title fool you,"The Princess Bride is not a chick flick, or a kiddy movie. It is one of the most complex films ever made. While containing all the elements of classical fantasy, fairy-tail, and folklore, it can also boast shining satire. It is part spoof on erro flyn, and part statement on modern culture, and part serious expression of what faithfullness should be. An english proffessor could have a field day analyzing this movie from a million different perspectives and never run short on material. The Princess Bride is a different story every time you watch, in conjunction with the moods and attitudes you harbor when you sit down. Enjoy."
5,Princess. Bride,Love it.Love it.Love it.Love it.Love it.Love it.Love it.Love it.One of our favorite movies!!
4,Timeless Classic: A Must for Anybody Who Grew Up in the 80s,"I purchased this movie to watch with my daughter who is 6 years old (which was right about the same time I saw it as a kid). Needless to say she fell in love with it right away and we have watched it plenty of times in the last few weeks. The bonus features are excellent; I dare anybody to not get even a little chocked up when they listen to Mandy Patinkin talk about his experiences working with Andre the Giant.The Blu-Ray transfer looks and sounds terrific. Overall a wonderful addition to our movie library and the best part is, because this movie stands the test of time so well, I was able to relive the magic with my daughter and all for 10 bucks!"
5,The best all-time movie around!!!,I think that this is the best movie that I have ever seen. I remember seeing this movie when I was little and I never knew the name of it. About 5 years ago I saw it on tv and I got the book immediately. If you love the movie then you should read the book. Chapter 1 in the book is my favorite part. I think everyone that reads the book could agree with me. I think that Cary Elwes was awesome in this movie. END
5,Very Entertaining Comedy,"A first rate cast and excellent script makes this movie an absolute delight to view. Many hilarious scenes, particularly the the ones with Billy Crystal as Miracle Max. And it is ""inconceivable"" to review this movie without mentioning Wallace Shawn, an actor I was not familiar with, but who was an outstandingly humorous villain. Cary Elwes was ideal in his role as the hero Westley. As Peter Falk says at the beginning, this movie has everything . . . from romance to sword play to miracles. I have enjoyed watching this movie several times over the years both in VHS format, and on this DVD."
1,The Princess Bride,"Very slow. Not up to the hype. It has some classic lines, but save the 2 hours. Kept waiting for Billy Crystal, but he must have been funnier on the set."
2,"I didn't get it..., it is good, but for children!","I don't know why people make so much fuss about this flick. It is kinda old for these days. I think it is quite a good film for kids. But that's it. It is not that funny, nor romantic."
2,Didn't live up to my expectations.,"I heard a lot of great things about this film, but I was sorely disappointed when I rented it last night. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was going to be. Princess Buttercup annoyed the crap out of me, too."
2,Good movie. Ok product.,Classic movie. But I didn't get to finish the whole movie though since it had some sort of problem where it wouldn't read and it would kick me back to my home screen. Its definitely an issue with the blu-ray disk because I've continued to watch movies with the same player for about a month now and had no problems.
5,As You Wish,"Ah, this takes me back. Not only is the video as incredible as I remember from my youth, but the special features are well done too. Now my own kids are getting caught up in this timeless tale."
5,Something for everyone,"Adult or child, its got something in it for everyone of all ages.I've seen it on Tv many times and enjoy it each time. Loaded with the best actors, comedy, drama, little mystery, etc. Buy it."
4,A great story with an okay dvd,"It's a story that the whole family can watch. It's got romance, comedy, and all that jazz. The dvd could use some more special features though. I suggest buying this. The 4 stars is just because of the lack of features."
3,A Woman's Personal Journey Post-Divorce,"This novel is about a woman's personal journey post-divorce. Coming from a Mormon background, she struggles with core values she's learned and questions she's yet to answer. She travels alone from Utah to Los Angeles and hooks up with several people whose lives entwine with hers.The book is good but skirts around things. How people love, what brings them together, and what glue holds them there are questions raised but never really answered."
3,Ok,"This guy has a scratchy voice. His tunes aren't complex, but they are catchy. He's a throwback to another era."
1,Broke,"Low quality, this torx bit sheared instantly while trying to remove a suspension bolt. I do not recommend for any serious work. It might work fine on a low torque bolt."
1,Horrible,"Got to say, looking for something better than what is at the local shops, and did a brake job and ended up shattering both torx bits i ordered from lisle. Both fell apart when any pressure was put on. Crazy. Would highly"
2,not very well written,"I do not write this as a literature expert, what's more my native language is not even English. But I've read a great many good English books and here's my take on this one.The idea of a book like this is fresh and original, but, unfortunately, it doesn't read like a good story. Sorry, it falls far short of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. Advanced vocabulary but choppy story line. It feels like a big story jammed into a small book. Characters are one-sided and undeveloped. The author seems to be taking a shortcut to disprove the evolution theory. I was disappointed.I'd say ""Life in the Great Ice Age"" is a much better attempt although not exactly in the same category."
5,Catch Phrase is great fun!,Catch Phrase is alot of fun. We played it with a large group of kids and adults over the holidays. Would highly recommend it.
3,Need large print version!,"This game is a lot of fun, but the words can be hard to read for some of my group that is aging...need a larger type edition!"
5,Fun Game,"Catch Phrase is a great game for 4 or more people. Lots of fun and funny interaction. Highly recommend as a change from board games.The game box was not in new condition, but the game itself was in new, sealed bags. A little packaging tape will keep the box in solid condition for many years.Vendor's delivery was better than expected."
2,Catch Phrase,I was not happy with this purchase.It wasn't the one I thought it was going to be. Sorry I bought it.
4,fun for a bit,"My family tired of this game quickly, but it was fun for awhile. Also fun for a whole crowd, we played with 12 people."
4,Just go for the 2nd edition,"This is a great game, but after playing the second version (which is completely self-contained; no board and no discs to switch-out/flip)I'd recommend grabbing that instead.That aside, this is a ton of fun especially for large groups."
5,needs new cards,I suppose I have played this game in groups more than 100 times. Almost everyone loves it and we have played it for MANY years. The problem is - the words to describe are getting familiar . We need new cards. We tried the electronic version. Several of us have and NO ONE likes it. The words/phrases are too hard and when passing the game around if someone presses the wrong button it messes up the whole game and score. Stick with the old version. At least until you have memorized all the words.... wait maybe THAT's even MORE fun ;)
1,Not rec'd as of this date,i DON'T REALLY HATE THIS BUT THE person it was sent to has yet to receive it and therefore I have no idea if it was well rec'd or not. I think it is terrible that something that is sent to a military family takes up to six or more weeks to receive. It was ordered in plenty of time to have been received.
1,Catch Phrase,I bought this game by mistake. I was so disappointed when I figured out it was not the electronic game.I did keep this game I figured my two grandchildren could play with it their way. Not a good item for me.
5,Organza First Light,This is a lovely light fragrance that I use mainly in the summer. It was in great shape when it came and I would order it again when needed.
3,Strictly speaking not Sci-fi,"Although this book is set in the future, there really is not much that is Sci-fi about it. The characters are ALL very quirky and witty. (Maybe it's a future thing when everyone has the art of clever witticism down pat) If you are looking for futuristic technology and new ideas, this is not the book for you. If you are more interested in how a plot is populated by tongue-in-cheek characters, then this book should sit nicely as an entertaining easy read. The series of adventures that our protagonist goes through are really not that mind blowing, and as he travels from world to world (of which there are quite a few - phew-) one is dragged along hoping the next challenge will be more 'challenging' (so to speak)"
5,Great CD!,"I enjoy the Getty's music very much. The songs on this album are all very good, Scriptural songs. ""In Christ Alone"" is my favorite on this album."
5,In Christ Alone,"A beautiful CD. The best song is Power of the Cross. Kristyn Getty's voice is delightful, and the words of that song are so moving."
4,Quality Worship Song Writing,"Great Songs that teach the faith. I enjoy listening to the CD, though it is lighter listening than a lot of other stuff I usually listen to. As far as the production and the performances go, some are really good, others are just okay. I bought this CD more to check out the songs for us in worship, most of the songs are worth consideration for worship services. I hope more people follow in the footsteps of the Gettys and Stuart Townend in desiring to write worship songs that have well-written lyrics that are God-centered and distinctly Christian, and music that is intended to be easily sung by everyone. Thanks Keith and Kristen for filling a great need in Christian music for artistic, poetic depth and even more importanly, good theology."
4,A great find,"I have read many books on parenting. This is one of the best. Although written for a group, it is also very good if you are reading it on your own. This is not one of those quick-read-feel-good fluff filled parenting books. It is thought provoking. I would recommend this to non-religious parents as well. The biblical reference are good but most of the meat is valid even if you don't have a bible handy. My other favorites are the Townsend-Cloud boundries and parenting books. They are also first rate."
3,Pleased...,"I found this book to be quite interesting and enlightening on several levels. However, it would be much more effective used in a group setting. I look forward to using it with other parents in my church."
5,HulaHoop DVD,"This is a fun, basic beginner hula hoop workout DVD, which is exactly what I was looking for. Not too difficult, but also includes things to work towards, like doing the grapevine while hooping."
5,Oscar D'Leon CD - Grandes Exitos,"As a salsa aficionado, I have most of Oscar D'Leon's hit songs, but I was looking for a couple that had eluded me, and I found them in this CD compilation, at a great price."
4,Very entertaining. No DVD closed captioning,"This was very well done. Kept a good pace, kept me captivated. Very entertaining story with some humor.I did find it hard to follow the dialog with the various dialects of the characters, so I wanted to use subtitle. Alas! Subtitles are not enabled on DVDs in this series (BBC white covers). I switched from viewing the DVD via the component connection to viewing via the coax ""VCR"" connection. That allowed me to take advantage of the television's closed captioning capabilities. However, I had to sacrifice picture quality."
2,Not Dickens at his Best,"Being a fan of Charles Dickens, I was completely disappointed with this production of Martin Chuzzlewit for several reasons.1. This particular story does not have likeable, interesting characters. (In most works of Dickens, the characters are incredibly unique and intriguing. They draw the reader into their world.)2. The actor playing the lead character, Martin Chuzzlewit, comes across the screen as incredibly boring. I couldn't decide if the problem was the character being played or the actor himself, but, I found myself fast-forwarding quite often.3. There were no redeeming set locations or supporting roles to make it worthwhile to watch. The whole production was just one long and boring drama.So sorry, Charles Dickens! Your last work was not your best!"
2,Half of Dickens,"I would love to be able to comment on Parts 1, 2 and 3 of Martin Chuzzlewitt, with the brilliant Paul Schofield, but on the single disc I purchased, we received only parts 4, 5, and 6.And while Schofield, and many other favorites, were indeed excellent in that which we watched, we will be forever curious as to how they did in that which we could not watch. Parts 1,2, and 3 were neither on the single disc, nor on any other!!!It is certainly disappointing to me, a steady customer of Amazon.com and its DVDs, that there is no quality control over the product, and indeed not a soul or a voice to receive a complaint."
5,GREAT Escape Entertainment,"Truly, one of the best I have ever seen and yes, do like to watch over and over again...I had a ""Dickens"" of a time in the mid 90's trying to find this video a while after it was first presented on PBS, but at the then discounted price of $60, it was very well worth it!It's an enthralling tale you become one with...you feel as though you are an observer on the sidelines trying to keep score as this thoroughly amusing bunch of people go from scene to scene, fleshing out Dickens' tale that portrays many of the worst and also the good and decent qualities of human behavior. The actors are THAT believable and so right in their respective roles!I find though that I have to listen carefully in a few parts of this story, as the words said in the thick English slangy accent from a few of the characters can pass me by.Altogether this is a truly superb show that unlike so much else out there, I will never tire of seeing again and again!"
2,BessWentworth,"While the sets, costuming and lighting were indeed gorgeous, the director dwelt almost entirely on Paul Scofield's witheringly biting delivery and on the comicality of different Dicken's characters. One is left without a soul with which to engage, and the story line suffers quite a bit, indeed. Style won over warmth, and halfway through this beautiful and lavish production, it's lack of real heart simply drove me away. I tried and tried, but just couldn't slog my way through. The book, however, I've read and throroughy enjoyed at least twice!"
4,one of the best dickens tv-ifications,"this 6-hour masterpiece theater adaptation of dickens' relatively obscure novel is a feast for fans of this type of thing, which i am. singling out paul scofield (duh...) as the elder mr chuzzlewit, and philip franks as tom pinch: the antithesis of uriah heep. recommended for those of a literary bent."
3,A little disappointing but entertaining nonetheless,"After seeing the excellent 8-hour version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" this version of ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" seemed to hurry through some of the most memorable parts of Dickens's book, such as Martin's and Mark's time in America. I don't feel that most of the main characters were given time to develop, either, and Martin Sr. didn't seem sufficiently curmudgeonly. However, Jonas and Mr. Pecksniff were acted superbly, and overall I enjoyed the film."
4,Decent,"It is no real fishing pole but works well enough for backpacking, the reel is a bit crappy but just took the reel off my normal pole and it works just as good."
3,Ok for the money but longer than advertised,"Bought 3 of these for my young children because they are advertised as 4'6"" long. When arrived are actually 5'6"" long which is hard for a 6 year old to use and learn to cast along a stream with brush and trees. Feel like poles made out of cardboard tubes but for the price I should have known..."
4,Gift for a bug-out-bag,"This came just in time for Christmas for a friend. Obviously, we haven't used it yet, but the quality appeared good--it didn't feel cheap or rickety. It's the perfect size to keep in the car or put in a survival bag. Just the thing!"
3,decent cheap rod; poor reel,"The rod by itself is pretty nice, considering you can fit it inside of a backpack. Is it worth twenty bucks? Possibly. That's up to you.The reel isn't balanced and unfortunately wobbles as it spins and simulates a nibble so I found myself jerking to set the hook all of the time.It is an okay product, but pair the rod with a decent reel and you have a nice travel setup."
2,"The board game is okay, but I don't find it all that great.","I bought the Animorphs borad game, and have played it several times. To be frank, I think it should be called a Bored game. It has a somewhat complicated game mechanism, with cards that you play to ""morph"" and affect the game. However, every time you play it, it's pretty much the same, and it relys too much on chance. I have foung it to be more challenging by distributing the morph cards so that you pick them up as you go around. I realize that Animorphs is also read by 7-10 year olds, and this is who the game is geared to. I am a 13 year old fan of Animorphs, and there are many older fans out there. I am probably too old for this game, but I would appreciate it if it was just a little more intelligent. Maybe the Playstation game will be better."
5,Excellent book for parents and professionals,I really enjoyed reading this book. I am 24-year-old graduate student and I have Asperger Syndrome. I am also studying to be a counselor and I hope to work with children (and possibly adults) who have AS and their families. This book does an excellent job of explaining some of the complex thought processes that people with AS go through. I even found some new potential explanations for some of my own thoughts and behaviors. I am giving this book to the therapist who works with me and I would recommend it to any professional or parent who wants to understand these very special children and adults better.
4,"Compassionate, Descriptive But No Real Therapy","This is not about deep or remedial psychotherapy for Asperger's. The author has worked only with children, and seems most involved with finding a way for school and child to fit together. In this search she has found and understood many differences between Asperger and neuro-typical approach to situations, and these are explained very well and non-judgmentally. This material is available elsewhere but it is always valuable to have many people's description of something that is subjective or perceptual. The author clearly makes the connection between children struggling in school with undisguised Asperger traits and adults in the families with slightly lesser or compensated Asperger traits. But she doesn't delve into addressing Asperger traits in adulthood (where there is a greater ability to work at change purposefully) The authors love of Asperger children is evident, but she clearly herself stands with the neuro-typicals."
4,Striking and Powerful,"Striking, horrific at times and ultimately enlightening, this book rips away the facade we'd like to see and gets to what is. It gets to the heart of the struggles those in El Barrio of New York must face. Their viable options are few, their solutions repellent, but these are real people who've been marginalized by mainstream society. For a look inside the El Barrio of the nineties, read this book!"
3,humm...,I bought this book for school. Not a book I'd have chosen myself but I admit it was interesting and brought up social issues I think many people ignore.
4,Decent Guide but Somewhat Lacking in Depth,"The first Hellsing: Ultimate Fan Guide covers the first six episodes of the bloody-good vampire anime Hellsing. The guide includes a fair amount of artwork--some promotional art and some scans lifted from the videos--and descriptions of each of the episodes, plus character bits and items on various aspects of the world in which the series is set.The episode summaries are okay if a bit thin; I suggest simply watching the anime itself. Overall, fans of the series probably already know everything in the book, but it's still a neat accompanyment if only as a book filled with visuals and concept drawings from the series. Roleplayers may find the bit at the end for incorporating the characters and world into the BESM game system useful as well."
2,"Good, when it's actually focusing on music","I used to think Rolling Stone was the best music magazine out there. Then I started reading magazines like MOJO and I realized that was not the case. Rolling Stone does a good job at talking about music, however, it is quite rarely doing this. There are frequently lengthy stories, and sometimes even cover stories, which have nothing to do with music, and this is really the reason I ever buy Rolling Stone, for the music articles. So, I reccomend trying something like MOJO instead and if you don't like it, go back to Rolling Stone, but I personally want my money's worth of music facts and reviews."
3,"On Again, Off Again","I've probably subscribed to RS 4 or 5 different times in my 40-year life, but I've never once renewed my subscription. Amid the occasional gems are just too many pieces written by ""Almost Famous"" authors who are WAY too full of themselves and hung up on pointing out how cool they are to be sipping lattes with this singer or just hanging in so-and-so's loft. Here's a clue: It's not about you! Okay, with that off my chest I suppose it's time to subscribe again."
2,Pretentious,"More and more, all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like, and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure, and if you indulge in such a thing, you are 'shallow'.Music has evolved past this attitude, and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore. And oh yeah, their politics is so mixed up, they don't even know what they believe anymore. I was a subscriber for eleven years, my renewal notice came, and I couldn't come up with one good reason to send it in."
1,They will threaten your credit rating if you decide to cancel,"The poor content of this magazine is the least of your worries. Think: credit rating. Once you put your mark on that little subscription card, they will hound you, threaten you to keep those checks coming. If you even think about canceling your subscription, a deluge of threatening letters will come your way. Don't even think about it ... stand back at least 500 feet."
1,Do NOT subscribe through Amazon.com,Do not subscribe to magazines through Amazon.com. It is the most inept and incompetent service. I have been trying to get their mistake cleared up (duplicate magazines AND incorrect delivery address) for FIVE months.
4,Rolling Stone decent for the mainstream audience.,"Rolling Stone is a magazine that has evolved to integrate more articles about style and celebrities in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience, increase circulation, and become more mainstream.HOWEVER, this magazine should still be known for its quality writing and journalism. Rolling Stone has won multiple Ellies in recent years, through quality journalism including sending journalists to Iraq, and an in depth nine month investigation covering Scientology.***For those looking for a magazine that focuses less on mainstream entertainment and more on quality look no further than Paste magazine. It is a little quirky but it is an excellent magazine to discover good films, and music. There is a reason why Wall Street Journal called Paste the 'Best American Music Magazine.'"
1,It's not much about music anymore,"I subscribed to this magazine back in the first years of print. Have been off/on with for the many years since. Kept wanting to believe it was about the music but through the years it has become more political than about the music. They would also focus on artists that were of the political bent consistent with their beliefs who are of no interest to me.I would get sucked back in with covers of the Beatles, Led Zepplin etc., and after a few subsequent issues would become disappointed again and cancel the subscription. Never again."
4,"not as good as it used to be, but still pretty good","This magazine is definitely not up to par with that it used to be, but it is still pretty good. Lots of info about new artists and still some great political and social reporting. It's more of a ""lifestyle"" magazine than it was at one time but is still the best thing we have going."
1,A disappoint,Rolling Stone has been going downhill for some time now. It's unbearable to read unless you're a bubblegum teen looking to sift through mindless trash. I was an avid reader in the past but not anymore. Don't waste your money on this and move onto something better!
1,Downhill,"After a long hiatus from my subscription expiration from the college years, I re-subscribed to RS what with my daughter entering the ages where she may appreciate what was the quintessential music and freedom mag. What a disappointment. The magazine that used to be all about music, with in-depth insightful articles from all angles; espousing freedom and anti-establishment---this mag has now turned into what reads like a Democratic Party National Committee publication with some music industry news. No more P.J. O'Rourke, just a party line complete with name calling and self identified with the ""blue state"" label of the Dems. Can get music news elsewhere. Maybe check you out in another 15 years."
2,DONT NEED IT PLEASE CANCEL,"PLEASE CANCEL ALL MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS IMMMEDIATELY, MIKE COYNEMIKE@SAIL4LESS.COM IT ISNT WORTH IT AT ANY PRICE CANCEL ALLTO SKILES/ AND OR COYNE"
1,Great Magazine for the Left Side of your Bookcase,I have not read Rolling Stone since it was on newsprint. I took the $1 subscription offer and it is $2 too expensive. It used to be about music and pop culture. Now it is all about politics and being a lapdog for the DNC. Save youself the buck and turn on MSNBC. Where do I cancel my subscription?
1,horse sh*t,Why did they put Kurt Kobain and Kirk Hammet ahead of Eddie Van Halen and Carlos Santana in the top 100 guitarist article? this proves that these retards don't know music.
4,Rolling Stone Renewal,"I am not the reader of this magazine. I buy this for my Grandson who is 17. I have never heard a negative from him. However, I DO NOT like Auto Renewal.!"
5,This is a great magazine,"I love this mag and have been a long-time subscriber. The political and social issue articles are excellent and always thought provoking.And back to the main point of the magazine, I use it to research and find new music. The interviews and reviews are always good (though I don't always agree with them but that's expected right!). Unlike other reviewers I understand that the year is 2011 and music has changed. We can't always have Jimi Hendrix and the Stones on the cover. I appreciate that the magazine helps me stay up to date on new music. But regardless of that, the relevant artists through the decades that are still producing still get excellent coverage in this magazine. The recent interview with Paul Simon was excellent as well as the articles on the Stones re-issue of the Exile on Main Street album."
5,13 Years of Rolling Stone Magazine,"I discovered Rolling Stone Magazine when I was 13 yrs old, I'm now 53 yrs old and I'm still reading Rolling Stone Magazine!"
1,What happened to Rolling Stone ?,"Thanks for all of the input. I was just about to order RS for my 14 year old bass playing son. I guess it's not the RS that I used to receive, which I couldn't wait to see. That's too bad becasue I am not going to order it now from all of the reviews you posted.I have now read that they have teamed up with MTV? What, they don't even play music anymore."
1,This rag is pathetic,"Over the years I have read thousands of music magazines. Rolling Stone never fails to be the lamest rag. This magazine jumps on every weak fad like it's a gift from God and the next big thing. They interview uninteresting people, ignore stars and bands that have survived 10, 20, or even 30 years, and make huge deals out of one hit wonders who will disappear in six months. I am proud to say I resent everything this magazine stands for. Go buy a Hit Parader or Metal Edge."
2,Rollingstone,"It is (or was) a music magazine, right? So why is it the magazine relies more heavily on celebrity-watch, supposed political expose', and that ham-fisted Peter Travers movies section? Do yourself a favor. Buy People magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Mother Jones, or Blender. You'll get just what you want and avoid all the sanctimonious crap. Hunter S. Thompson and cover photography are/were its only claim to fame."
4,Rolling Stone is still Relevant,That's much more than I can say for most magazines. I received the Steve Jobs cover and enjoyed it. Their interviews and personalities profiled are to me the best aspects of the magazine.
2,"Good Magazine, bad start to subscription","I enjoy Rolling Stone magazine so no complaints there. What really annoys me is that my subscription started with three past issues all received on the same day, and my start date listed as the first old issue.I realize that this is a great way to for a magazine publisher to unload back issues that they wouldn't normally be able to sell, but I had been buying them at the newstand so they were worthless to me. I've written a letter to their subscription department requesting a remedy, but this practice is not appropriate for a music magazine that supposedly carries current news."
1,pathetic,"It's not what is use to be ...good, insightful articles. Give me a break with the sleazy juvenile covers."
1,I very disappointed purchaser!,"I thought this magazine was about the Rolling Stones (the band). Their career is still booming, even in 2005. Who cares about Star Wars movies. 1 star for false advertising."
1,I used to look forward to receiving it,"but that was years ago. I got a subscription not too long ago at a great price. Not worth it. It is full of ad's and a lot of the information on artists has hit the web several weeks before the magazine even gets to print & is very 'gossipy' - you can get 'gossipy' online free at various sites, if that is what you are into. I think that you are better off picking up a copy at a store and looking it over first. I really cannot recommend that enough. The album review section is still OK as the Billboard charts, but again, you can get all that info online WAY before Rolling Stone even gets it to print. I am not renewing my subscription either. Waste of time & money."
1,..if you're a 50-something liberal white guy,"... if you're a 50-something Blue state white man, this is the magazine for you. If you think Bob Dylan is the most important artist of all time, Hunter S. Thomspon is the best writer, percussive-heavy music gives you a headache and sampling confuses you, and a half-naked Paris Hilton or Simpson sister turns you on, this magazine understands you perfectly. Otherwise it's like hanging out with your dad's friends who're trying to convince you they're still cool. I wish my subscription would hurry up and lapse already!"
2,Rolling Stone has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"I love Rolling Stone. It's in an oversized format, has great in-depth articles, and one of the world's great film critics, Peter Travers. Having said that, I have to say their ""customer service"" is the WORST. I am a subscriber and from time to time, for whatever reason, an issue doesn't make it to my mailbox. When I've contacted them about it I swear to god I'm talking to space aliens. When I've missed an issue, I want it REPLACED with the UNDELIVERED issue. So what happens? I won't bore you with the details, but I'll just say nobody there understands English; getting issues resolved is like pulling teeth with them. I am convinced Rolling Stone has contracted their customer service department to some third-party. Either that or RS truly doesn't give a damn about taking care of their subscribers. Jann Wenner, DO YOU GIVE A DAMN?? I HATE them!"
1,Amazingly bad journalism,"I used to read this magazine in college. What was I thinking? When I look at it today, I realize the quality of the journalism is terrible. Blech."
1,NOT RECEIVED,I have still not received my first issue. Please tell me who to contact with this concern!I was really looking forward to this great value but this is very disapointing.
1,An Open Letter To Rolling Stone.,"Dear Rolling Stone,There is more to music than Chingy and The Strokes, but I guess you wouldn't know that being a music magazine and all.Thanks,Heidi Kakes"
3,it's OBVIOUS why RS only charges 50 cents an issue!,"I just recently signed up for RollingStone after my dad was telling me what a good magazine it was back when he was young. Damn, both he and I were shocked at how bad the magazine is. I mean, once and awhile it has some worthwhile articles. But for the most part it's all bullsh**. More than half the artists these guys do articles on are terrible musicians (ie: Nick Lachey, Fall Out Boy, American idol rejects, ect). Also, the political commentary is completely biased to the liberal point of view....that can be a little annoying at times. My point is, the reason RS sells there mag for 50 cents an issue is because thats all it's worth. .50 an issue isn't a deal, at best it's fair. If the price was any higher, nobody would subscribe. So if u have 20 bucks u just wanna waste, maybe check this out."
2,"A ""read"" that I once enjoyed","Maybe it's my ""graying"" or the magazine's, but Rolling Stone is no longer on my list of favorites. Having been a subscriber for close to three decades, off and on, I find myself at odds with the direction of the magazine as well as the artists covered.While I am a firm supporter of liberal ideas, I do think the mag's overly leftist stance alienates a major segment of potential readers. More varied opinions would allow the magazine to broaden its clientele.Also, if one wants to see ""flesh"", he/she would pick up a Playboy or Playgirl, don't you think? Too many of the photographs, while reflective of the times, border on the soft-core pornographic.This is definitely not a periodical for the coffee table."
1,MIGHT AS WELL BUY US WEEKLY OR PEOPLE-,"This once brilliant magazine has turned into a VERY Political, Leftist, version of the trashy tabloids that are unfortunately shaping our Celebrity Obsessed disgusting society...For God sakes, Paris Hilton has become an idol for our Teen culture...we are screwed!"
1,Just 100% trash,"They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover... but this just takes the cake. some of these covers are just plain obscene and they only make the star's ego even more bigger, leading to more arrogancy on their part."
1,Radical liberal GARBAGE,"The political content in this rag is ultra-left, I'm talking crazy Cindy Sheehan kind of nutso leftist clap-trap. I ignore the political stuff and read the music features, but that's pretty much crap too. Rob Scheffield is the WORST thing to happen to this magazine maybe in it's history. His writing style is just so annoying. He thinks he's witty but it's simply unbearable. I used to like reading the movie reviews of Peter Travers, but this is a guy who will rave a movie upon release and then if he realizes he was in the minority, he'll turn around and list it as one of the years worst (or vice versa). It's all poop."
2,Politics or Music ??,"To much emphasis on their ""left wing"" agenda. They miss the Clinton administration."
1,will not cancle,auto renews even though canceled not worth the trouble i can not ask any one to order this unless they want a headache
1,Rolling Stone------RIP.,"Oh Lord!! Does anyone still read this?? I was a subscriber back in the early 70's,when it was a folded up, newspaper.By and large, Jann Wenner let people run it, that knew how to. It is now, and has been nothing more than an Ad choked,gossiping Teen slick.Right, like they are the ones with the money!! I wonder what they still pay Raoul Duke, to do??!! Ralph Gleason has to be turning over in the grave."
1,It's just like eMTVee....\,All media hype and commercials with hardly any music.Corporate Culture at its finest.
1,I just don't like it,"I strongly dislike this magazine.It's meant to be a music magazine, and yet most of the pages are covered with barely dressed celebrities, and men's fashion.I don't see how it's any different from Maxim, or FHM, it's just that it's marketed as a music magazine.And there are more features on Brtiney and N'sync than any teen magazine."
1,RIP,For years Rolling Stone was a truly great rock 'n' roll magazine. Then a truly great counterculture magazine. Then a truly great general interest magazine. Now it's nothing but flapdoodle. Senseless drivel presented as witty meanderings for [mindless people] who need to be told what music to buy.
5,Nephew loves it!,This was a subscription for my nephew who is in a federal prison in South Carolina. He loves this magazine and received his first copy within 2 weeks of my ordering it.
4,a magazine,Matt TAibbi and Bill McKibben both write for RS. genuine political journalistic integrity with a point of view... plus some music stuff about lots of music and musicians and gossip that I could care less about.
2,Stupidly political,"Stupidly political magazine. Way too much hateful, biased, sensationalized, political stupidity. Can't we stick to Rock and Roll?Good for puppy training."
1,Ridiculous!,Rolling Stone is a disgrace to music! The magazine only writes about talentless bands and every issue insults the reader with its shameless political propaganda. If you even have the least bit of love for music don't read this trash and read a magazine that cares about music such as Spin or Under the Radar.
1,Not what it used to be,"I remember when I was 12 years old. Impatiently waiting for my RS to arrive, which I read cover to cover. Every article was golden and the reviews were usually spot on.Now flash forward 20 years later and it's a different story. I am just as much into music now as I was then (and maybe even more now). The cover stories have seemed to have strayed from talented musician to the popular vote of today's Tiger Beat star or reality show star. The reviews of the music are pitiful and could not be more off. I just do not enjoy it any more. I stopped my subscription over a year ago.I was browsing Amazon when I saw how poorly rated this magazine was and thought ""wow, I'm not alone"".Maybe it's just the poor state of music today. There are no real talented acts being interviewed for this magazine."
2,Cancelled!,"Ever since they started routinely putting flavor of the month American Idol and Mickey Mouse Club artists on the front of the magazine I became embarassed to have it deliverd to me. With the exception of Frick's Picks they mostly review radio friendly albums marketed by large record companies that nobody will care about in a year. In addition most of the political coverage is either biased or poorly researched.I understand Rolling Stones desire to remain relevant by covering artists that will only have fleeting success, but they've gone too far in an effort to just sell magazines. They've sacraficed their ability to have any long term influence on the music industry and become simply a mirror of the reality show driven and celebrity obsessed pop culture that currently exists."
1,If I Could give It 0 stars I would,"What else can I say that other reviewers haven't said already? I can add that I used to love this magazine back in its heyday and when I read it, the publishers seem to care about music & serious subjects but instead we get lame synthetic pop thats forcefed to people and R.S. seems to be going along with it. In this case, I think the old adage ""Let the buyer beware"" fits epecially well."
2,Don't bother,"I subscribed to this magazine hoping that I would get some good exclusive news and interviews with good music artists.This magazine is very short and is filled with usually old and stuff you have already heard from TV news. Expect to read about the pointless celeb garbage you hear on TV, its all repeated in this magazine.I am libral kind of guy when it comes to politics but this is to much. Everything in this magazine is very liberal anti-bush politics. They have a section in the magazine were an editor reflects on current world affairs, expect nothing but Bush and right wing bashing in this one.Interviews are horrible. Nothing exciting. Muisc reviews are not detailed and don't acctually review the album all to much. Just a short sentence or two about the artist and then a star rating.Look at the average rating of this magazine on Amazon.com. Listen to the reviews. Don't subscribe to this trash."
1,Rolling Stone is good. AMAZON BLEW IT!,"Mag is fine, but thumbs way down for Amazon! Sent me a special for $1 for this subscription. I order the SAME DAY and they refused to honor the deal because the offer had expired the day before. Why'd you send me the email!?!? Charged me full price, spoke to customer service twice, and they won't provide a refund or return. TERRIBLE!!!"
4,Fast Delivery,I was impressed by how quickly my subscription started. Interesting magazine. New size is a positive feature.
4,Great Magazine. Needs to move away from the mainstream.,"Good quality magazine. Brilliant when it goes outside the mainstream. Generally very accurate with its album reviews. It would probably be better if it was more edgy and less like ""People"" magazine(I guess you have to sell ad space)."
4,Has gotten better recently,"I'm a long-time reader of Rolling Stone, bit for a while a few years back they almost lost me. It seemed like they were trying to become a teen magazine - cover stories on Clay Aiken and the Britney Spears are for Teen Beat, not RS. My beloved Rolling Stone was going downhill fast.Happily things have improved recently. Now some might argue they skew too much towards classic rock - but as an ""old fogie"" I guess that's fine with me. The political writing has been excellent lately also, mainly thanks to Matt Taibbi's phenomenal coverage of the financial meltdown and the criminal scams on Wall Street (and in Washington).I have always enjoyed Peter Travers' film reviews also, although I think there are probably better sources for music reviews online these days than RS. Overall though, usually a lot of good reading material in each issue and well worth a subscription."
2,"take out the ads, and the mag is only 15 pages.","these guys pander so much to rock stars and the industry it makes me want to wretch(blahargh!!). I just did. But neway, some good articles. Cover is excellent for defacing with a sharpie marker. I think that's the only reason I subscribe."
4,Magazine for the Modern Informed,"I have had Rolling Stone for 2 years now and I have yet to be disappointed. Not only is it a great way to keep on music trends from the past to the present, but it is always a great way to get information on local, national, and world news stories. Its a great place to get lots of fun but quality information. I am not the biggest reader but for some reason I just can't put these magazines down. And its not only about mainstream music, which makes it a great place to broaden your horizons and to learn about new music trends as well as to remember the often forgotten music of the past. Definitely a magazine that gives you a great bang for the buck."
2,Did not order this magazine,"I did not renew this magazine but somehow it was renewed for me. It is a very good subscription price, but being so busy I have not had time to read the magazine so I was not going to renew. Somehow it automatically renewed. I am looking into canceling the magazine not because I do not enjoy it but because I never get the chance to read it."
2,Caution,"Rolling Stone magazine is great, but be careful... Amazon.com will automatically renew it at full price! I cancelled my auto-renewal, but they charged me anyway! But they were good about refunding my account. Now I see that they have renewed it again!!! I will not ever again order magazines from Amazon!!!"
2,WHAT HAPPEN TO ROLLING STONE ?,"I GUESS IT HAS BEEN A FEW YEARS SINCE I PICKED UP A ROLLING STONE MAG. THE SIZE OF THE MAG IS NOW 30% SMALLER, THE FILLER IS WAY TOO MUCH (ADS, ETC.) ON THE PLUS SIDE GLAD TO SEE DAVID FRICKE,LIKE HIS STYLE OF WRITING.I AM GLAD TO BE RECEIVING IT AGAIN,IF THEY GIVE ME ANOTHER YEAR FOR A BUCK THEN I WILL KEEP IT."
5,fast delivery as always,i have ordered magazines from amazon in the past and as always it comes even before they say and we have never missed an issue. plus the price is better the most of the other sites
1,Not happy yet,I have not received a single issue yet. I was expecting to receive an issue before now. When I get my magazine maybe I will have a better opinion but until then I am displeased.
1,Subscription,It would be nice to receive it. STILL haven't received a single issue. What's going on? I hope I haven't been charged for it.
1,Didn't understand what I purchased,I had thought I was purchasing a 1 year subscription to Rolling Stone. So I spent 9.95 and rec'd nothing!Think I'll stick with buying books.
1,At least I only paid 46 cents an issue...,"At least I didn't pay much. Awful magazine, but it'll make for great paper to help burn firewood this winter."
1,feel like paying for a biweekly advertising brochure?,"one need only look at RS's recent ""women of rock"" cover to realize how far the mighty has fallen - a celebration of such corporate, novelty flash in the pans like ""pink"" and ""avril lavigne"" alongside majestic performers of yesteryear like aretha and joni mitchell. truly interesting, dues-paying artists like nelly furtado and kasey chambers got half-page side mentions in this issue; lavigne got several pages of pictures and long-winded interview / drivel.if you enjoy having your intelligence insulted on a routine basis, this is the magazine for you."
2,More music than your average fashion magazine,"Oddly enough the best articles in Rolling Stone are the political ones. You can find those once you wade through the cigarette and alcohol ads, somewhere sandwiched in between a few random articles dealing with music. Not bad if you only like mainstream pop, but if you want real coverage of rock, pop, hip hop, electronica, indie, and even a decent look at americana and rock and roll history, try ""Mojo"". Sad that a british mag could cover American music better than Rolling Stone, but RS has just gone downhill. I look through back issues from the early 90's and find interesting articles in every issue, the type which now come along every 6 months or so now."
2,Garbage Magazine,"Well, I suppose if you enjoy articles on lengthy men's members, the hottest pot schools in the country and the bitterness of liberals, this is the magazine for you.I've had a subscription for a few years now and the coverage of music versus politics and social commentary has dwindled down into virtually nothing. I didn't get the rag for the anti-Bush crap and the apparent praise and worship of thugs such as G-Unit, 50 Cent and the like.At least they will give a little focus to upcoming bands and artists. A little.Oh, by the way, ""Get Your War On"" (the little annoying comic strip in every issue) is about as obnoxious as they come."
1,Understanding does not mean ....,Understanding the lament that times change and RS has to change with the times in order to define the times .... doesnt bring any satisfaction in receiving a magazine with Justin whatever on the cover. I have never had so many times of barely being able to get through articles ... it does not hold interest ... there is a bridge out with RS and I will certainly not renew - I subscribed for many years and am a long way for being too old to rock and roll but the surface skimming pop drivel ... not feeling it ... platitudes and rationalizations aside it appears that we are at a parting of the ways... uh its not you ..its me ...I dont like you.
1,It's just bad.,It does make a good place to train you dog and/or cat.Also some of the pictures are in color.
2,"Occasional profoundness, but overall its a yawn","I subscribed to Rolling Stone five years ago, but I have since let it run out because it started drifting away from feature stories about talented rock and hip-hop groups and started focusing more on Britney Spears and N-Sync. Whereas it used to offer quite remarkably in depth stories about the lives and work of real musicians, it has started to cater more towards the pop fluff of teeny boppers and bubblegum blasphemy. Every now and then I will see it on the newsstand with an article about Bruce Springsteen or Keith Richards, real musicians who have quality stories to tell, but the majority of what I find is useless. You'll be better off to limit yourself to an issue-by-issue basis as opposed to buying 26 issues at once. But like I said, it can still please every now and then. I just feel its quality stories are too few and far between."
4,"Not the Rolling Stone of my youth, but that's okay","I stopped reading Rolling Stone magazine shortly after the Kurt Cobain Tribute issue. My boycott had nothing to do with the driving force behind Nirvana, necessarily.Shortly after Cobain committed suicide, Frank Zappa - a truly gifted musical pioneer - died from cancer. Yet, there was no Tribute issue commissioned on his behalf. Instead, (if I remember correctly), he received a couple paragraphs buried in one corner of a page. I found this to be disrespectful, and I cancelled my membership.Well, there's been a lot of water under that bridge, and I now find myself back to where I once belonged. I missed keeping up with the latest bands and band releases.I still haven't quite forgiven them for dissing Zappa, or for when they named Sinead O'Connor Artist of the Year, but I'm working on it."
1,Pathetic,Rolling Stone is a humongous waste of ink and paper. I'm scared to take it to the restroom with me because then I'll be tempted to use it as toilet paper.
1,Boycotting Rolling Stone,"Wenner Media, the owner of this magazine, is responsible for shameless attacks on Sarah Palin and obvious bias in journalism. I, for one, won't be buying anything associated with Wenner Media. If they go bankrupt, it's their own fault and rightly deserved."
1,Why,Why send me an offer that doesn't apply out side of the U.S.A ?You know I live in Australia fder fek sake.
1,"pop culture ""lick my nuts""","first of all justin whats his face isn't black you cracker. and You think that band like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan are lame. have you ever heard of the pop culture bandwagon because you have jumped on it. the only thing that britney spears is good for is looking at, if you want to hear good music find a ac/dc or van halen cd. as for rolling stones mag its jumped on the band wagon with you."
1,Puhleezzzz,"When, oh WHEN will Britney twig to the fact that ""That Kiss"" was a cynical attempt to ruin her career?(mind you, for once I may actually be in support of the ever nasty Madonna on that one)Britney dear, at least find a publicist with some brains.Rolling Stone, if only you had retired while still at the top."
2,But does it gather moss?,"I only received this magazine a few days ago, therefore I feel that I can not give it a proper review as of yet. What I have read was interesting. This Mag is a lot thinner than I remember... To be honest, the only reason I purchased this Mag is because Amazon had it on sale for $1.00!"
1,Shame........,"This use to be the best music mag out there, with its great music info, reviews, and updates about big music news, but now.......now its just about selling the cover. It lacks the information, news, etc that made this mag sell like crazy. Now they just make a nice, ""hot"", glossy cover~expecting to get stupid people who dont actually read the mag to buy this.This ""new age"" of the mag, has really shamed its old good name. Any good review in this mag has lost its worthiness, at least for one old fan."
2,maybe itll get better again??,"The only reason I'm still a subscriber to Rolling Stone is because when i got it, it was a lifetime subscription for 100$. Hopefully it'll go back to the way it was back in the day (albeit before my time) where they covered important music and culture vice what's relevant to the masses"
1,A lot of people have written . . .,A lot of people have written in to complain about the decline of Rolling Stone magazine. And they're right. But I didn't understand why until I read Russell David Harper's BALD: in which the good old days of Led Zeppelin and the right to the pursuit of decadence are mourned. (The narrator's loss of hair is just a metaphor . . .)
1,waste of money,if i was poor i would be upset on wasting money on this trash however due to my fierce spending power i dont really care - i am happy just to purchase this awful commerical magazine just to slag it off
1,Disappointing.,"I subscribed for one year and it wasn't money well spent. I wanted a magazine that would cover the cutting edge of music. Instead, I got a magazine mostly filled with one-sided political commentary and a few pages about music--in other words, crap. The writers of Rolling Stone need to return to what they did best in the first place, which is writing about the music. And either drop the political commentary, move toward the political center, or give both sides EQUAL TIME.And while I'm on equal time, cover more electronica. It is, after all, the 21st century."
1,Music is the Root,What happened to this magazine. It supposed to be on the cutting edge of music insteed of just MTV's Popular crap.
2,Old issues,Was sent 2 old issues at beginning of subscription. One was no longer on shelves other had been on shelf for seversl weeks
4,Wait until you find it on sale!,"Got a 3 year subscription for $11.97. That's only $3.99 a year. Don't pay $20/year for this, do a little research!"
2,I'd Rather Read Random Obituaries,Boring read. Some content informative and entertaining. Most of it is rather boring. It's currently taking up space in my bathroom as reading material.
1,Did not want auto renewal and could not cancel,Love the magazine but I did not want renew due to travel schedule. Amazon wouldn't let me cancel it and the reminder to review it brings back my frustration with the situation.
3,Not like the other,"I remember the original R.S. of past and I gave this a hard look as well as sharing this out with a couple of my hardcore music neighbors but after they quit reading it and I lost interest, we all agreed it wasn't quite the same as the original."
1,Too political and way too liberal.,"This magazine has become a platform for anything way, way liberal. It's so left sided and biased to be insulting. The magazine has chosen to become a democrat political forum, which is sad. Will not buy again."
2,Rolling Stone,"I was just disappointed because there eas only music i the first issue. I have been checking out Rolling Stone from the library and buying on the newsstand because of the political articles. I hope that the future issues will continue the ""in depth"" reporting that you had before."
1,Taking up space in my recycling bin,What happened to this magazine? What was once an interesting magazine about music and musicians...is now just a trashy tabloid. The covers all look alike--cheesy and borderline middle school nasty.I skim quickly when it arrives and put in the recycling bin pretty immediately. What a waste and what a downward spiral to witness. Sad.
1,"Like the magazine, hate customer service","I have been a subscriber for 15 years and still enjoy the magazine. No, its not the best magazine for music, but it is one of the best for for general pop culture news and I still occassionally find new artists because of the magazine, though I tend to find more new movies now.However, if you ever have a problem with customer service, forget it. I never got my copy of the 1,000 issue, and when I asked for a replacement, I was told they were out of that issue, but would extend my subscription by one issue. I pointed out that it was a double issue AND that they are still selling back issues on their web site for $20. If they don't resolve it quick, I might just cancel my subscription, I'm so disgusted."
1,A Shadow Of What It Was,"Don't bother, devoid of anything that doesn't have a corporate label attached"
1,Expected Better,"Here were the cover stories for 3 of the 6 issues that I recieved. Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and Nirvana. Talk about 3 horses that have been beaten to death. There is NOTHING current about this magazine, nothing cutting edge. If music had a history channel, this would be it, only they talk about stuff everyone knows already. They are in need of serious changes in the CEO level of this magazine, or i can see it going under in the next 10 years. The 60's are over, the 70's are over, the 90's are over, Rollng Stone needs to roll its calendar over."
4,"Commenting on the Service, not the Magazine","Amazon steps up again. I've received Rolling Stone for about 25 years and I continually get their renewal offers with the worst rate applicable. If they offer a special rate in print, you cannot find that on their customer service / renewal page. Amazon is providing a better rate than Rolling Stone directly and they'll eliminate all of Rolling Stone's garbage mail too. Like many others, I also think the magazine is pretty weak...but I can't complain for 26 issues at $20/year. If it were more reasonable, I'd get Mojo or Uncut...tremendously better music mags without the ideology."
4,Rolling Stone,I like it! Keeps me up to date on the music industry past and present.Let's me know what direction it's going in.
1,Don't order from this vendor!,"The vendor for this subscription fails to deliver product. When I complain, I get a bogus excuse about the address not being deliverable in spite of the fact that all other mail and Amazon products ordered seem to find the way to delivery with no problems. Amazon itself is unable to get the product to me and is only modestly useful in mediating with the vendor. If you want regular delivery of a subscription, going through Amazon is surely not the way. I have been burned 2X..."
4,"Politics and Music, my two favorite things!","I am only 25, so I guess I can't comment on RS now vs then, but this is the only magazine that I subscribe to. I think the political articles are awesome, although admittidly left in leaning. And really, it's not RS's fault that the music industry sucks now compared to back in their hayday. I like that they don't measure their success by how many hundreds of band names they can mention in a single article, like other music mags. I have to say though, I HATE the new format. The big dimensions was what made them special."
2,It's really two magazines...,"As an entertainment magazine, Rolling Stone is still fun and occasionally fresh, if rarely cutting edge.As a political magazine however, most of the articles and editorials read like sanctimonious rants from an overzealous, know-it-all freshman poly-sci major. To say that it's a left leaning magazine is to understate the obvious. But the insanely over-the-top invective in many of their articles is just downright unprofessional."
1,Sad...,"I am a huge fan of music... Rolling Stone no longer is the cutting-edge music magazine it once was... If you enjoy pop music, then this is a wonderful magazine for you. If you enjoy a diverse look at music that is happening now, and just enjoy music as an art form (i.e. musicians, not dancers with an attached microphone), then this is NOT the magazine for you. I wish Rolling Stone would go back to its glory days of rebellious writing and stop kissing the diamond rings of the rich and talentless... I have let my own subscription run-out, and although it's a great price, on principle I will not resubscribe..."
3,Not what I was expecting,After reading what must have been a double issue of Rolling Stone I purchased a subscription. When I received my first issue from my subscription I was disappointed at how many pages the magazine was. Until then not realizing that the previous issue I read must have been a double issue. The magazine does have some interesting articles (could have a bit more) and good coverart but poor selection of pictures.
4,Glad I tried the offer,"I tried this because it was $1 for 6 months, but when it came time to decide to renew or not to renew I realized how much I like this magazine, some great in-depth articles that have nothing to do with music. Very good, I recommend it to anyone who likes music/books/movies and good articles."
1,I did not autorize this auto renewal,This is not a review of the magazine rather a warning to those who order magazines through AmazonI did not know that my original subscription would automatically renew without any notice. The worst part is they charged my Discover Card for it even though I have over $80 sitting in my Amazon gift card account. Watch!!!
2,Ugh...,"I received a free subscription to this magazine, and I was excited. The magazine arrived, and the cover looked intriguing. Interviews, music and film reviews, political commentary, etc. Sounded like a good magazine.Then I started to read it. First off, the magazine is incredibly light on content; half of the pages are ads, and the many of the rest are filled with photos. For a monthly magazine, there is not enough text.The political commentary is left-wing. Depending on your political views, this is either a good or a bad thing, but even if you are a liberal, most of the writing isn't articulated very well, and just comes across as super-biased blabber.There is the occasional good article, and there are good writers on staff (film critic Peter Travers is exceptional), but when my subscription ended, I was more than ready to be done with it."
3,Not what it us to be.,Rolling Stone use to cover rock music at one time. That is the reason I subscribed. When did Kanye West become rock music? YUCK! The articles about John Lennon were very good. Otherwise the magazine sucks.
1,Terrible Horrific Bad Barfeable Disgracefull Lame Disgusting,No whare near the magazine Billboard this has a bunch of crappy little (...)bands that no one likes and it has terrible articles Bushes Crimes against something i mean its one thing to diss Bush and its another to show some consistancy.Plus they have the Barney wannabe Bob Dylan as the number two artist what about that one guy named Elvis Presley here are the reviewsArticles 0 pictures 0 Specials 6 Enjoyable 2 Lasting 1Overall=9/50 One of the worst things of all time.
1,Is this an entertainment magazine or Obama's mouthpiece?,"The recent issue of Rolling Stones (Metallica on cover) is the recent and probably the last issue I would buy. This magazine's music stories are still great but hey what happened to it? It's now turned to be a hard Leftie magazine intended to mislead readers. This is sad that a reputable magazine like Rolling Stones has become a mouthpiece for any candidate, be it Hussein O or McCain. It doesn't matter whom they favor to me. What matters is that they have lost their credibility to remain an objective and fair publication. Will never buy this again!"
1,I never received the magazine,I subscribed over a month ago and have not received the magazine. Service typical of everything I order from Amazon. This time I will keep my promise to myself and NEVER do business with Amazon again. I waited two months for an in-stock book on my last order. I have learned my lesson.
4,Not horrible,"I didn't grow up with Rolling Stone in the sixties and seventies, because I wasn't born yet. As far as magazines go right now, Rolling Stone is a pretty decent publication. There's definitely a fair share of pop fluff, but there's still a pretty decent issue in every 3 or so. I'd love to find a magazine that reports on the current state of rock while also updating us on what's happening lately with great artists of the past. Rolling Stone attempts to do this and achieves it a fair amount of the time. For the price, it's worth the subscription.In response to all the seriously negative reviews here on Amazon, all I can say is that I haven't found a better rock mag so far... any suggestions?"
4,Who is really at fault here?,"I would like to take a moment to defend Rolling Stone. I understand what you all are saying, and in general, i agree. Too many ads, talentless pretty faces on the cover. But it still has really interesting in depth political articles, news, and fair music and movie reviews, as well as beautiful photography. It sounds to me like most of you are just bitter about the state of popular music today, which is not Rolling Stone's fault. They cover popular music, they don't create it. Altogether, an interesting, worthwile read for any music fan."
2,Ooops wrong gender,"I always heard that Rolling Stone magazine was more of a ""chick"" magazine, but for $5/ I gave it a shot. There is more testosterone in a Martha Stewart Living magazine. I guess it's OK for teenagers."
1,don't like it....,"at all. .I just don't like it.There aren't even any good music issues.This magazine is totally boring and commercial.It has more features on britney and n'sync than any teen magazine.I'm also not a fan of the photos.It's your typical ""sex sells"" magazine"
2,Too bad they care less about music and more about what they think may be cool,"I read rolling stone for the music and those who make it, not for some guilt ridden, agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics (and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate) is something we should all read about at nauseum. when they stick to music, it's good, when they parade their shreiking political views, it's boring."
1,there's nothing left,"i, like many other people here, have let my rolling stone subscription run out. it's not very often a magazine can have a 0.50 per/issue subscription price and still be a rip-off. this magazine is pretty much us meets teen vogue on bigger paper now."
2,Disappointed,"Two stars is generous. When the featured celeb is the barely literate, hardly relevant Snooki, my subscription got cancelled. And I used to have so much respect for this magazine."
2,Overpromised,I tried this product on a very persistent mustard algae problem. It worked fine ... for two days and then the algae came roaring back. I'll have to try something else.
1,BORING WITH SENSELESS VIOLENCE,Do cinemagoers really want to see a film with the violence so over the top and ongoing that it detracts from any worth that the film may have had. Don't believe the hype on the dvd cover sleeve which says that the film is loaded with nudity. There is very little and no frontal- everyone keeps their privates hidden. The story is also over the top and unbelievable. How could so many students just disappear from College without anyone wondering where they are. The film is overlong at 2 hours and also boring.When you can't write a decent story just pad it out with excessive violence as is the case here.truly a worthless film.Doesn't the director know that less is more. The less you show the more the audience get to see as was the case with Hitchcock.
1,Disappointing in the extreme,"Fortunately I bought a used DVD of this title in the marketplace. Even at that I feel I wasted my money. This movie is so bad I feel like I just gave away an hour an a half of my life for nothing in watching it. The plot is not believeable at all. This is just a senseless gore fest. It has none of the characteristics of the classic suspense slasher films like Halloween or Friday the 13th. I was not once on the edge of my seat anticipating the next moment of fear as there was none in this movie. The acting is atrociously bad as well. I actually like most Synapse DVD releases but not in this case. Rent it, if you can, before you decide to buy. You'll be glad you saved your money."
4,It does the job.,"It's not the strongest tool I ever seen, still it gets the job done. Others more expensive crank extractors like the pedro's may be more appropriate for professionnals."
3,Power of Dreams,"Bollywood has yet to surprise us for the year 2008. After Taare Zameen Par, we have seen nothing to quench the thirst of cine-goers. Well, for those of you who are planning to watch Sirf, it isn't all that bad or let me say, not as bad as Tashan. It is the story about unfulfilled dreams. It is the story about not so content people, who are just not satisfied with the way things are in their life. It is also about breaking away from the monotony of one's life in such a way that it can ruin one's life. This movie could have been executed better, but the acting of Ranvir Shorey, Kay Kay Menon and Sunali Kulkarni has certainly made it a watchable movie!!!"
2,Dissapointed to say the least.,"I love W. Spzilman's Concertino for piano and Orchestra, his Overture, and his Waltz in the classical form. Also on Youtube I liked very much his Pop songs, sung in Polish.This recording however dissapointed me from every point of view, the music, the orchestration as well as the performance by Wendy Lands."
2,Very overrated,"David Lynch has always made interesting films. Well, besides this one. I really can't see anything in this film that holds me to the screen the way Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, etc can.I'd say people should at least rent this one, maybe they'd like it. But I suggest renting one of Lynch's other works first."
4,Wildly Delivered,"Kudos for delivering the item so quickly. :DThe dvd was in good condition, and even shrink wrapped when I got it (which confused me...) but very good to go with this company!"
1,Lynch Misfire,"I have been singing the praises of David Lynchs amazing cinema oddoties for years.Eraserhead is an amazing stunning movie,Twin Peaks was the kick in the arse that tv needed,it threw the rule book out of the window,it was sublime,superb & perfect, hell I even liked Dune! Now that brings me to Wild at Heart,what a dogs breakfast of a movie, with possibly 2 of the least compelling characters I have ever seen on film.I dont know what bored me more,Dern & Cages hammy over acting, their yawn inducing love making or their constant inhaling of disgusting cigarette smoke! The scripting of this turkey was dire,the other characters repulsive especially Defoes horrble Mr.Peru! The only character that had any decency was the one played by the always reliable Harry Dean Stanton.The icing on this horrible cake was the inane & idiotic references to The wizard of Oz, what an insult to a classic.Mr.Lynch I still love you but this movie is something I abhor & now the copy I bought is land fill somewhere!"
1,Great Movie -- Terrible DVD Transfer,This is one of my favorite movies. But the DVD sound quality is terrible. You really have to crank the volume up to hear anything. And then you hear lots of static and distortion.
5,"Wow, it has chapter stops.","Cool. Yeah, Lynch is a great director, but not putting chapter stops on most of his DVDs is just plain dumb. Plus, he's price-gauging on Eraserhead on his website. A rare instance of a little bit of studio interference in this case (I'm sure it's they who insisted on markers on this and ""Blue Velvet"") being a good thing."
2,Do not buy this product if you live in the U.S.,I should have known that this dvd would not play in my american dvd player. I have bought dvd's in other regions when I was out the country on leisure only to come home and find out that they would not work on my player. But I was somewhat misled by the region code in the description. Great Movie though.
5,The best role of Nicolas Cage,"It seems to me that this is the best role Nicolas Cage ever played. His character is funny, over the top. It would be a shame if MGM would not release this movie on DVD. The whole movie it`s a comedy, even in its violent parts. Without a doubt the best film Lynch ever directed, after ""Blue Velvet""."
5,take a bite of peach,"superb, sublime, sadistic. have you ever had a nightmare that you actually enjoyed? imagery so powerful and suggestive it would haunt your mind for days? if so, this film is for you. and if you enjoy this film, then you might also enjoy u-turn."
3,Take a walk on the weird side!,"Surely, this is one of the weirder love stories ever put on film! The two lead characters, Sailor and Lula, are young, in love, and INCREDIBLY STUPID. As you follow them through a surreal, hellish landscape filled with weirdos and perverts, you wish them luck ... but it's hard to take much of what transpires very seriously. There are just too many set pieces populated by bizarre characters, and somehow you just know that eventually everything will turn out all right despite the lovers' cluelessness.Some of the production is quite lovely; in other places it's just strange. Willem Dafoe shines as the creepy, reptilian Bobby Peru. Harry Dean Stanton, Grace Zabriskie and Crispin Glover do a fine job of bringing minor but memorable characters to life.I would not recommend this movie to anyone easily shocked by fairly explicit sex, violence, or just all-around creepiness. But if you like offbeat, somewhat unsettling films, ""Wild at Heart"" might be right up your alley."
4,IMPROBABLE HOKEY ENDING??!!??,"not sure how anyone could take this film as anything other than a surreal,dark comedy (for adults) - this film is loaded with Lynch's trademark ""weirdness"" that just compels you to continue watching (much like the auto accident you pass on the road).i particularly enjoy the quirky character actors this film is loaded with (LOVE the Crispin Glover cameo!)so,yes this film is well worth repeat viewings making it a wise purchase for your dvd collection.the added bonuses is the icing on the cake!"
3,Not very adjustable.,"Ths harness doesn't adjust very easily or very much, which. Amex it hard for my growing bunny to n fit im"
4,Not bad,Item arrived in a timely fashion and the price was right. The shrink wrap tubes were smaller than I expected. I didn't end up using them on the project that I was working on. I suppose at least I have them for the future now.
5,refill,i purchased the entire kit and now time to re stock and this worked great and the price was reasonable also.
5,Good assortment,This is a good assortment of heat shrink tubing. I used some of them when extending the wiring of undercabinet lights I just installed. Cheaper to get these and modify the wiring myself rather than buy wire extensions with plugs. They are a good length. I can't imagine needing them longer. I was able to cut them in thirds and they covered my splice with at least a 1/2 inch of room to spare on either side.
4,Wonderful Religious Commentary,This movie is somewhere between taboo breaking and sacrilegious. It's portrayal of the church as a corrupted institution is second to none. Wonderful acting and effects surrounding a very interesting story.
4,one of my faves...,"i love this movie. but then, i'm one of those who questions religions generally. as someone else said, the premise is that father alameida was working to translate parts of the dead sea scrolls -- which are believed to contain something that promises to shake the foundations of the church.weirdly, alameida's rosary winds up in the hands of an atheist woman who starts to experience the stigmata. and she also starts writing parts of the dead sea scrolls on the wall of her apartment. alameida is speaking (""revealing the truth"") through HER. A WOMAN. perhaps symbolic of mary magdalene.stick with me here: some folks believe that mary magdalene was actually jesus' lover, and that SHE was supposed to carry on christ's teachings. and therein lies the premise for the movie.there's lots of age-of-aquarius-the-truth-will-be-revealed type of stuff in here. oddly enough, reading ""the da vinci code"" by dan brown will help fill in some of the movie's gaps."
2,Could Be Called Snoremata,"If you've seem the trailer, you've seen the film, not much more happens and all of it boring. The possession stuff is interesting, but as soon as the heroine is OK again you may as well go to sleep. The tepid attack on the Catholic Church is the films only saving grace, but sadly, the Catholics I know weren't even insulted."
3,Stigmata movie review,"I enjoyed the movie very much but was extremely disappointed in the sub-titles. They were not shown throughout the movie, were inconsistent and sometimes displayed in a foreign language. I was also disappointed that the movie was produced in wide screen format only. It was not as pleasurable to watch on a full screen t.v. The content and quality of the DVD was excellent, however."
1,The Author definitely have not read Gospel of Thomas...,"WOW...this movie is nothing but a trash.Gospel of Thomas does not talk about anything that threatens hierarchy of church.Gospel of Thomas was not written in AramaicDiscovery of Gospel of Thomas in 1945 was no secret, everyone knew about it.Gospel of Thomas teaches that women need to become male to be saved...which is non-sense and very contrary to Jesus' teaching.If you watched the movie and thought""What is church trying to hide?""My question to you is...""Have you read the Gospel of Thomas?"""
1,Just people screwing around with movie making equipment,"This movie is terrible. It's not really a movie, it's more like people pretending they know how to make a movie. It's edited so rapidly, I began to believe the director didn't know what he was aiming for. I don't mind rapid editing if it's done for effect, such as in ""JFK"" and ""Psycho"", but this was mind numbing. The acting was somewhat descent but the script has got to go. ""The Exorcist"" was 100% better and those who haven't seen ""The Exorcist"" and choose to see this instead because you can't stand to watch old movies, you should be shot. I wasn't offended by the religious aspect, just the filmmaking. When the scene where the priests are throwing holy water on Arquette, I was ashamed to see how they ripped off ""The Exorcist"" so well. This movie is as bad as they can come, so PLEASE AVOID AND DON'T WATCH!"
1,Did I miss something?,"This is an awful movie. One cliche shot after another, cobbled together to resemble an MTV video. Oh, and then there's the evil Catholic church, resorting to murder to surpress dissent. Please. You could drive a truck through the holes in the plot. Save your money."
2,bleedin typical,This is one of these uninspiring movies that no body will remenber in five years. There is a lack of plot in this movie.it is just the bleed typical nonsence that you would expect to come out of hollywood.Every time the tension sags ~Patricia arquette will be afflicted with a new wound and gabriel byrne(the priest) will look very worried. Okay so the acting is very good for this type of movie which is the main reason why i even gave it the two stars along with the impressive special efects. The film is also far too short and you almost feel as if the director had rushed the end of this film. I find it surprising that films like dogma were attacted by the church and this type of film wasn't.
2,Maybe not worth it,It is up to you what you ultimately will watch but I wish that when I was at Hollywood Video renting this I would have accidently picked up the wrong movie. I think Stars Wars was next to it. At least seeing that for a third would have been more enjoyable than this.
3,Interesting film,"This is apparently one of those films that is meant to send a message about religion. One of the messages is actually pretty good - that you can't find God in a house, which is relevant because the Catholic Church struggles to maintain power. There is a young woman who mysteriously suffers the wounds of the stigmata, though not all at once, and she frantically tries to make this stop before the fifth (and fatal) wound is inflicted upon her. Overall a decent film, not great but not awful."
4,Title says it all.,"This movie is well shot. Plenty of foreshadowing helps make this a very enjoyable film to watch. Stigmata is a supernatural suspense story about good, evil, and faith. Frankie Paige played by Patricia Arquette is a hair stylist who has no strong religious convictions until odd things start happening to her after she's given a rosary by her mother: she begins speaking with another person's voice; unknown and unseen forces start to attack her; and she develops stigmata. Some people believe that a holy miracle has been visited on Frankie, though no one can say why. A Cardinal from the Vatican played by Jonathan Pryce sends a priest, Father Andrew Kiernan enjoyably portrayed by Gabriel Byrne, to investigate Frankie and her condition; after getting a first-hand look, Father Andrew finds himself less concerned with whether Frankie's wounds are a legitimate miracle and more concerned with saving her life."
5,A woman as the Crucified....,"....how up front can it be?A hairdresser is battered by stigmatic sufferings. In Aramaic, a language from the time of Jesus, she writes on the wall of her apartment that ""the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you."" Heresy!!The voice that announces her bleedings and butcherings and self-slashing agonies is always male. The traditionally masculine principle of arid spirituality can even elevate her off her bed, suspending her in mid-air.It is women who suffer being pinned up, being hammered, being crowned with thorns, all the world over, but without getting any hearing on the agendas of the governments.Let us be aware that the female victim in this film is taken over, not by just any old man, but by a religious idealist. Dying wasn't enough for him. This has a patriarchal angle; but it also reflects the fact that something worth hearing speaks forth from our wounds."
5,"Missed the HYPE, Found a GREAT Film","Just had this film shipped over to the UK, watched it this evening and was so glad I did.Enjoyed every single minute.Having only seen the trailer once, I ordered the film blind (without checking it out at the cinema).The marketing of the film here in the UK hardly made an impact on me, and I certainly didnt go into the film expecting a millenium update of The Exorcist.Great atmosphere, Nice all round performances - especially Arquette and Byrne, superb direction, editing and soundtrack.DVD has an extremely nice animated menu area - Nice one MGM. Extra`s good too.Well worth purchasing."
5,Highly spiritual and misunderstood film,"I think it's very funny, that almost all bad reviews are written by people who don't understand the plot or people who are themselves part of an organized religion. This movie does somewhat accuse the church, but most of all it is meant to make you think about organized religion. Why does one need to build a church filled with beautiful statues to reach their god ? If people were to view this movie open-minded they will discover that it is a pro-religion movie, not an anti-one."
5,Not the horror film I was expecting - but good,"When I saw this movie at the theatre I thought I was attending a horror movie. There are some pretty bloody scenes, but I don't consider this to be a horror film.Patricia Arquette plays Frankie, a party girl and atheist who develops signs of the stigmata. Gabriel Byrne plays the priest from Vatican that is sent to investigate the validity of those symptoms. The situation creates conflicted emotions in both characters that play out well on the screen.Even though this wasn't the horror film I was expecting, I was not disappointed. The acting and cinematography are good. Some of the special effects are realistically bloody, which is the reason I would recommend the movie for the adult audience only."
3,Pretty Good......,"Always seeking a good horror film, I bought this movie at a good price. Of course, it's 7 years old now! Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne deliver good performances in this thriller of a movie. Arquette plays Frankie, a woman of little faith who doesn't believe in God. Her life is forever changed when one day, she starts to show the signs of Stigmata.... the wounds of Christ after being crusified. A priest from the Vatacan ( Byrne ), learns of this and is summoned to investigate. As her wounds keep appearing, Father Kiernan becomes determined to save her at the risk of losing his faith and also his life. Good special effects in this movie. By NO MEANS can this movie be compared to The Exorcist but there are a couple of disturbing scenes in this movie adding to the suspense. Overall, a good movie that won't keep you bored. Worth renting!"
3,Almost a great movie,"This was by far one of the most interesting movies to come out in '99, but don't be mistaken. The basis of the film is a quote from the ""Gospel of Thomas."" Many of the passages of this Gospel that they use in the movie are not in the book. Others are simply miss-quotes. The filmmakers counted on the fact that not many people have actually read the ""Gospel of Thomas."" Also, the books that the movie says the church is keeping from the faithful are easily available. They are just not canonized as holy texts. However this is, after all, just a movie. As a movie it stands well on it's own and is worth watching. Some spectacular special effects (though some could have been better handled) and a well thought out plot make this movie memorable. Great performances by Arquette and Byrne that, in the hands of lesser actors, could have turned into a bad movie."
2,NOT a great movie....,"I thought I would see a very interesting movie which I thought would bring me more in that religious belief and history of stigmata.......but in fact it seemed the story of the movie was short and came back over and over (i.e. The girl goes to her job as a hairdresser, after that she receives the ""marks of the crucifiction"" then the priest goes to her apartement and wipe her forehead with a wet towel.......than she return to her hairdressing, get stigmata, appartement, wiping forehead...) all that with some differing events, but it seemed all the same and was boring. The special effects were very well done but we weren't enough in an atmosphere of fear----> angles of camera differing from normal movies could have been used there.One possession scene was captivationg but the others weren't as much, which is why I give it only 2 stars."
4,Good Movie - Better Food for Thought about relegion,"I enjoyed the movie; the acting, special effects and entertainment level were enough to keep me glued to the TV. For 2 hours. This movie more than for entertainment value should make people question at least the Catholic faith. I believe in God I always have, but I have never bought into the belief that you have to belong to a church or a certain religion to be with Jesus. Since the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls there has been controversy and this movie raises the question if the Vatican has been forthcoming about the interpretation of the scrolls or if they have held something back in fear that the truth would unravel the Vatican and the Catholic religion as a whole.I don't have the answer I just live by the motto ""question everything"". You may never know the answer but it is everyone's responsibility to ""find out for themselves"" to the best of their ability."
4,Good Movie!!!!!!,"I liked ""Stigmata"" not only because Gabriel Byrne and Patricia Arquette are very good actors but, the storyline was good. I did see some of ""The Exorcist"" characteristics within this movie but, I thought that it was a very good thriller because it definitely wasn't horror for me. It had some great special effects though."
3,"OK, so it's not all that bad.","Upon watching Stigmata again, this time with the alternate ending on the DVD edition, I found that this version of the film is a much more emotional one, and definitely the better of the two. Also, some things were missed by me in my first viewing of the film, things, I regret to say, make my first review of the film obsolete. The scenes in which Frankie is being attacked by the stigmata are full of religious overtones, especially the scene in the subway where she is stretched out as if she were Jesus on the cross. I also enjoy the scenes in Frankie's apartment, where her candles give the room a sort of calm sense. The movie wonderfully portrays 90's culture and its clash with the church. Performances given by Byrne and Arquette are very believable and unique, especially for a very religious actress playing a confirmed athiest. Again, I apologize for my slanderous and inaccurate review of Stigmata, for it is not a terrible movie; it is worth watching."
3,Where Is The Story???,"I was expecting a lot more of this movie. It had the chance to be a movie in line with The Exorcist, Omen, The Seventh Sign, & God's Army, but fails. I'm irritated - It's like having a Royal flush and dont know what to do with it! The suspence is on the same level from beginning to the end, it doesn't get more borring and it doesn't get more exiting and suddenly it's over... The 3 stars is because Gabriel Burne playes fantastic (as allways) and also Arquette is good. The filming, editing, sound and effects are truely great. I don't understand all you that gives it 5 stars??? Try taking the 6 & 7 stigmata scenes out - what is left? A borring movie with a good point..."
4,brilliant concept,"Wow. Even for being a non-Christian/Catholic, the premise behind 'Stigmata' is riveting. Take a cornerstone philosophic idea on theism and expand it broad enough to cover almost any religion, and you have the concept portrayed in this movie. A must-see for anyone interested in the multiple paths to God."
1,Lame Pseudo-Theological MishMash,"Thoroughly dull, addle-brained wannabe-supernatural ""thriller""---rips off at least a half-dozen other (much better) movies, fills the screen with pretty but meaningless special effects, dull characters you don't care about, and a jumbled, unfocused view of faith. Nothing's set up convincingly, and there's no real payoff dramatically or viscerally for this incredibly lame story. The writer couldn't even come up with a decent villain---the least a hackneyed horror film can do is give you a good Bad Guy/Girl, and the denoument is so silly and lame that I wanted to throw something at the screen out of sheer boredom and frustration.Insultingly stupid."
2,Stigmata,"Item arrived on time. However, box was damaged and dirty. The videocassette is also dirty and not even rewound."
3,Back to Normal,"It's about a priest who goes on a date. Nothing special, just obviously changed. Good, things are back to normal."
4,Great Movie,"Well worth buying. The Alternate ending and the deleted beginning scenes are best viewed first, then see the original(theater) ending separately. A few of the deleted scenes are good also, as they help to fill in a few parts a bit better. Only downfall was not expanding on the lost scriptures of St. Thomas But all in all a great Movie"
1,Pretentious!,"This is one silly, pretentious, little film,very confused (by no means confusing) and judging by its imagery and sentiments aimed directly at minds raised on MTV. Please! People of faith will not be moved. The admonition, as I picked through the mire that is this film, was to be not like ""whited sepulchers..full of dead men's bones and corruption"" to have a living faith... Gee, who said that, I wonder? It's in the Gospels. As far as this little flick is concerned: No ""revelations"" here. Read the Book instead!"
2,Decieving,"This movie offers a great deal of true and interesting information, but while you are watching it you must be sure to depict what is true and what is fiction. Make sure you are paying attention to this movie so you don't get the wrong ideas in your head. Also remember that contrary to what this movie makes you believe, it is a movie and nothing more."
4,A STICK IN YOUR HEAD FOR AWHILE MOVIE,"Stigmata is one of those select ""freaky"" movies that stick in your head for some time after viewing it. Although much different than The Exorcist it has the same freaky qualities. For instance, in some of the scenes Franckies voice is that of a monster that conflicts her looks; this will make the hair stand on the back of your neck. When watching the movie you never know if she will be possesed or not, you will find you are always on edge. I was disatisfied with the ending although it fits. The alternate ending (directors)is much better than the theatrical ending."
2,Dumb political statement masquerading as a thriller,"I am not a Catholic, but Russian Orthodox, but nevertheless I was upset after watching this movie. It contains anti-Catholic agenda, pretty blunt and offensive, which says more about minds of the creators of this film than about Catholic Church. This film can't hold a candle to genuine and much deeper ""Exorcist"", story about real possession and exorcism. Why to create mediocre film merely to make a political, anti-Catholic statement (not very convincing one either)? I still can't believe that the American director could shoot the movie so much resembling official Soviet Communist anti-religious propaganda."
4,Good Drama,"This is a fictional story about a woman who was given a rosary from a priest who is said to have miracles preformed in his name. After receiving the rosary from her mother, she starts to receive the stigmata- the wounds of Christ. Considering she is a non-believer, she doesn't have a clue to what is happening to her, until the Church sends a priest to investigate her and her story. The more stigmata's she receives, the closes she gets to Christ, the more the priest believes it is really happening and not just an act that she is trying to fool the church. The plot esclates from here, and involves the cardinal in the church who is trying to cover the whole thing up. There is a twist in the end that will leave you guessing right up to the end. The movie also offers two endings for you to see. The movie has good special effects, language, some graphics - for blood , and has some sexual content. Good movie, but NOT for kids or preteens!!"
4,Pretty good movie,"If you disliked this movie for lack of story, plot, or overuse of special FX, than that's fine. But if you disliked this movie because it was ""anti-Catholic propaganda"", then get over yourselves. It was a movie that I enjoyed, and felt had a good message. There are those out there that would hide any truth that would destroy the Church, especially one as influential as the Catholic Church. Do I feel all priests, or all religious people, are this demented? Of course not. But there are those that are. There are points where the movie starts to drag, but all in all I thought it was a good movie, not an ""abomination"" or ""product of Satan""."
5,cool g8y,...This was a very entertaining film.Very scary! Excellent acting.Not for those with a weak stomach!
1,Boring and Predictable -- Rent Exorcist or Omen instead,"The general topic seemed interesting, and parts of the movie hit on that, but then the movie takes a nose dive into a completely unbelievable and incoherent plot, involving unbelievable and unsympathetic characters.I like supernatural movies, but not ones like this which insult your intelligence and put you to sleep. I guess that explains why the soundtrack is cranked up (technical note: really terrible sound mixing) -- probably the only thing that can keep you awake.If you want to see the real quality of this genre, go see movies like Exorcist and Omen. The X-Files even had an episode on a stigmatic which was far more interesting, well-written, and better acted than this flop."
2,A forgetable religious/possession flick.,"The characters were uninspired, the story was full of holes (why didn't Patricia's mother become possessed since she first obtained the rosary?), and the ending felt really rushed. Despite a few good, scary posession scenes, this is an overall boring film."
2,Bad Script,"This movie was pretty lame, mostly because of the script. Not a very interesting story and not well told. Furthermore, Arquette is really not a very good actor. The Omen and the Exorcist are the leaders in this genre... Stigmata doesn't warrant your attention."
3,One Major Flaw,"Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this movie I did have some reservations about giving it five stars. I'm not Catholic, but I found the idea of the Vatican condoning violence to cover up Scriptures of any kind unnerving. I wouldn't have said anything but some of the reveiwers believe in this theory. Amazon sells books on the Gospel of St. Thomas. It's not hidden away. Read them first before you organize a lynch mob. The story is fictional people,fictional."
3,my review,"I was very apprehensive when I first saw this movie, for I thought I would be seeing a scary movie with devils and all.I am glad I was agreeably mistaken! The story does not relate to any scary monster or devil. It actually deals with the finding of a hidden manuscript. You can put together mystery with some history and mix this with good acting, and you have the makings of an interesting movie."
4,Between 4&5 but it's far from perfact,"Scarry.......NO Entertaining.......YESI found the DVD version to be an excellent purchase with the addition of the 2nd ending. Kinda Resembles Blair Witch in a way, but Stigmata is scarier and no dizziness factor. On the downside I thuoght the movie needed more suspense. Although Stigmata portrayed the subject very well the acting needed improving, especially from the priest."
5,A Must See!,"So, Stigmata got a few bad reviews. Well, so what! If you like exciting, intriguing movies, you have got to see this one! Patricia Arquette shines as a NY hairstylist who, after getting a gift from her mother, recieves the stigmata, or the wounds of Christ. Gabriel Byrnes is at his best as a Vatican Preist/Investigator. I can't say enough about his riviting preformance. The religious themes weren't exactly true, but so what. If you want accurate religion, don't expect to see it at the movie theater. By the way, check out the soundtrack, it's definite ear candy!"
4,Thought provoking,"The movie was very thought provoking and sheds a different light on the church than they would have liked. It shows that although the Catholic Church is important in supporting the teachings of Christ,it is just that and not the personal voice of God. The alternate ending was different and it was real difficult to not pay attention to it's message. This is a must have DVD if you like thought provoking films that question your faith and beliefs. Enjoy!"
4,Trashed by reviewers unjustly,"Stigmata may not make it to the hall of fame as the scariest movie of all time, but it did have enough action and special effects to keep you quite riveted. Despite some of the throwback nods towards ""The Excorcist"" in some scenes, overall I enjoyed this far more than the Sixth Sense which was grossly over rated."
5,Great Movie. Ending defines what a true christian should be,"I found this movie intresting to say the least. and as some reviews stated, I did not find myself asking for more, or syaing thats it? at the end. You have to have open minded about religion. And about how the Catholic church is a fraud, and lies and covers up the truth about the holy word for the purpose of personal gain at the expence of others. SEE THIS MOVIE..."
1,It don't deserve one star,"This movie has got to be the stupidest movie ever to come out of Hollywood. Not only do I NOT like how they portrayed Christ, but the acting was bad. And the people who say: ""This makes me wonder about religion,"" GET OVER IT! Nothing in this movie is remotely close to Christ's teachings, it is just a big money grab. Although, I am a Mormon, not a Catholic, I have no respect for the way they portrayed Christ, whom I personally believe in."
1,What MTV would make --- if it made movies,"I tried to figure out who the producers and director of this bomb thought would be the likely audience profile for this movie. My best guess is they decided their target audience would be people who:(1) Regard MTV VJs as witty, brilliant thinkers,(2) Have spent more time in their life reading cereal boxes than the Bible,(3) Would prefer books with ""lots of pictures"" to those with nothing but words,(4) Have had their principal exposure to Catholic teachings come from people who know more about Martian horticulture than true Catholic teachings,(5) Think that Cosmo and Vogue are literary masterpieces,(6) Are angry that Bart Simpson never won an Emmy for best actor,(7) Think Melrose Place is a deep, thought-provoking series about real life.Sorry for the sarcasm, but this movie cries out for it. Some reviewers have suggested approaching this movie with an open mind. I recommend approaching it with a gas mask."
1,Not very good at all!,"Stigmata centers around the story of a woman who becomes stigmatic. This means she is afflicted by the 5 wounds of christ. The problem with this movie definetly isnt the story. It has great potential, good plot and some good effects. These are the problems. Terrible casting aside from Byrne. The direction is all over the place. The film is so unclear. Whoever dircted this should have been fired. A few good moments but nothing worth seeing. End Of Days was 10 times better! Not for people who are offended by these severly reliogusly films. Not reccomended"
2,Interesting premise but badly done,"I really liked the premise of this film (that religion should dwell in the individual instead of a church) but overall, this film is a mess. I had a headache by the time it was over after endless scenes of dripping water, people running out into traffic, car crashes and thundering doves flying over the place. The movie is extremely noisy and violent and yet when the characters are speaking, you can't hear them! Not recommended unless you enjoy seeing entire film sets destroyed with LOTS of noise."
3,Stigmata,"A powerful compelling film about a woman suffering the tortures of Jesus Christ. The atmosphere this movie invites us is dark and the camera work was very well done. But overall the film is quite predictable and yes, its ending is a revisit to the frightening room of Satan in the Exorcist. The soundtrack to this film is amazing."
1,Total Bull.,"A film that ATTEMPTS to be intelligent but just comes off as an Exorcist ripoff. Half of the movie is focused on Frankie's cries of pain and blood gushing out of her arms/feet/whatever. Its potrayal of the Catholic Church is amusing, in a sad sort of way. It potrays it as a sort of ""mafia"", and the ending statement to the film is nothing but anti-Catholic propaganda. The fact that an athiest can get stigmata is riduclious, but not as amusing as the fact that they make it seem you can get ""infected"" by the condition from a pair of rosary beads. A stupid, uncreative horror film that attemts to throw down the Church and comes off looking stupid and uneducated in the process."
1,Boooorrrrrriiiiiinnnnnggggg,"As best I can tell, this movie appealed mainly to two groups: (1) adolescent males who think the quality of a movie is directly proportional to the number of special effects and the sound volume of the soundtrack; and (2) embittered, hateful neurotics who get cranked on any movie attacking religion generally or the Catholic Church specifically.True Sci-Fi fans will be disappointed. This isn't even a good Exorcist rip-off. The premise for the movie is unique, even though factually void.However, the WORST aspect of this movie is that it takes itself far too seriously, and once it does that it collapses. It degenerates into a preachy, self-absorbed sermon --- exactly the type of religious mentality it presumes to attack."
1,A very negative review,"I hated this movie. I found the whole plot insulting, as if the writers and director felt that they could put together a mosaic of thoroughly pointless, unexplained scenes and sub plots just because it looked neat. The characters were unbelievable and stereotypical. The movie made a grand attempt to be deep and thought-provoking and failed miserably. Stigmata left me with the urge to gather the producer, director, writer, and all the cast together, spank them all very hard and send them to their rooms without their supper to think about what they have done. I am sorry if this review offended anyone who happened to enjoy this movie, but it hurt me very badly and I needed to hurt it back."
4,Don't believe the critics!,"This movie is much better than critics would like the public to believe. The movie is the most original movie I have seen in a while. Sure it can be weak at points, and borrows from other fils, but so do all contemporary movies. I amusually a harsh critic on these types of movies, but this one surprised me. Anyone who has ""doubts"" about organized religion will like the dramatic sub-plot. The stylized cinematography was perfect for setting the mood..."
3,Hmmmm.......,"The movie itself was very well done...but I see the message as being a bit misleading.I disagree with the entire Christian concept so...I couldn't stand to listen about how ""god was blessing you with this incredible gift,the gift of the stigmata"" the part that bothered me was how it was considered a gift....yeah?bleeding the ""wounds of christ"" untill it eventually kills you is a gift huh?yeah,your loved by ""god"" right? and when he's done with that,why doesant he ""flood us all agian""???"
2,STYLISH NOTHINGNESS,"This trifle portends to be one of those spiritual razzle-dazzla thrillers on the order of The Exorcist, but fails to deliver the single most important ingredient: an engaging,coherent story. Instead, realizing the vacuum this movie truly is, the filmmakers-turned-stylists layer gauzy MTV-effect on top of effect. The movie exists in some kind of altered state, and is mind-numbing after the first fifteen minutes. Enough with the dripping water, already, and the badly reconstructed demon-personality moments; this movie is a crashing bore; but for the obvious artistic talent of the set designer, who creates a mood, and the pumped-up video-style score, this movie would get no stars from me. Endless, uninvolving and empty of any character development that pulls you in; there are no real scares and the distorted plot provides you with no shocks or enjoyable surprises. One of the worst movies to tackle the subject of spiritual horror/suspense -- buy The Exorcist instead."
2,Honestly not that good,"The movie had a good story at its core, but it never really tries to add up to anything meaningful. Loud for the sake of being loud, heavy-handed when delivering any sort of moral, and confused at times about its own plot, Stigmata goes nowhere."
3,"Um, Okay?","It was an alright movie. Not for everyone, may offend. But other then that okay. It wouldn't be on the top of my list, three stars is over doing it!"
3,Entertaining mystery... but not riveting,"I rented Stigmata because the plot had that Seventh Sign feel to it. If you are looking for an outstanding mystery like the Seventh Sign, or a horrifying thriller like the Exorcist, you will be disappointed. This is a mildly entertaining mystery that will make you think (especially when you read what the movie's based on at the end), but no more.Unlike other viewers, I did not care for the acting, and I thought that some of the scenes and dialogue were cheesy (e.g., the scene with Frankie and the priest laughing over lunch---huh? ). Overall...not a bad movie, just don't expect too much."
4,Not your typical possession,"I found this to be a very intense film. The special effects are fantastic, especially the fire that doesn't consume. The reference to the Gospels of St. Thomas, found in 1949, bases it enough in reality for me. If you're a Christian already, this movie may make you re-think how you worship. If you're not, you may re-think your lack of faith. Oh, and Gabriel Byrne's acting brilliant as usual."
3,"NOT SCARY ,BUT GOOD!","Stigmata was a good movie,I enjoy it!the story was good,the cast was also good too.Why I give 3 star because Stigmata was not scary."
2,Decent Start....Bad Follow Through,"I was skeptical when I first rented this movie b/c I thought that it would be an Exorcist ripoff. However, I was pleased to discover that it did contain some originality in both the storyline and the effects. Although, after watching the movie I was left with a several questions regarding the plot and the characters. Overall, the idea/concept for this movie is rather thought provoking but the story leaves far too many loose ends. I thought that Byrne gave a fine perfomance, Arquette's was weak (maybe it was just her character) but the movie is by no means 'whole'. You will finish this movie asking yourself ""What?""."
4,Interesting alternate version,"I've just come away from watching this DVD. I have mixed feelings. A very interesting concept and one that I have personal interests in; I am not 'religious' in the sense of attending a particular church or faith, but I have spent many years studying the nature of theologies. It was interesting to see a film put forward an alternative view to a mainstream audience. Acting performances were generally good and the visual style added to the tone; losing colour over time as Arquette fades away. I was particularly struck by the alternate ending which fitted the general tone of the film much more than the theatrical release's 'happy ending', increasing the impact of the film. The film did skim over some parts of the plot and could have had more substance and structure, but overall I found the film interesting and enjoyable."
4,Don't pass this up so quicky...........,"The dynamic opinions of this movie may make it difficult for one to deciding whether this movie is worth buying or not. Based on the overweighing consensus, you are MORE likely to ENJOY this movie than hate it. So go for it! I personally loved every aspect of this movie: the story line, acting, photography, special effects & Dolby 5.1 are all top notch. If you have a good home theatre set-up, the DVD format is a true delight for all your senses."
1,Blazfemmy!!!,"Ok, first the music is done by Billy Corgan. That egg headed freak knows about as much about music as nuns know about birth control. The dead sea scrolls or secret sayings of Jesus are heresy. If Jesus wanted us to know these things, he would not want me to learn them in a Billy Corgan music video. They would be in the bible. I know the bible, and this stuff is not in the bible. The Catholic Church is hiding some things from us, but they are not lost in the couch cushions. They will be reveal to me, and maybe even you when the time is right.Patricia Arquette, David Arquette's wife, has some of the worst hair in movie history. Anybody who gets their hair cut in he salon must also find in acceptable to have her hair styled by Stevie Wonder. She looks like a bleach blonde chicken. But I must admit it was a relief to see a preist make out with a woman rather than a little boy."
1,Sadly Disappointing,"When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it would be very good. However, when I saw it I felt as though I was watching an MTV video. This movie was, unfortunately nothing more than a cut and paste movie. The beginning could have been at the end, and the end at the beginning. There was a great lack of any sense of continuity, and the storyline did not seem to make any attempt to reconcile this. Further, this movie seemed to have its own private agenda which it wished to get across, moreso than to make a decent flick. All in all, I was very disappointed and this was one of those many movies that leaves you saying, ""at least the special effects were good."""
1,Stigmata,This has got to be the worst movie ever made. The acting is horrible and the script is horrible. 2 hours of my life I will never get back. What a waste of time! I wouldn't even rate it one star if I could! It's just that bad.
1,do not waste your time,"this film is not worth your time and money first of all the only good thing about this film is that it shows the hypocrisy of the catholic church And as a catholic I was shocked to learn that the church would deny such historical documents. such as the gospels of st thomas, anyways that is the best parts of the movie the performances by arquette and bryne are so bad that everyone who saw this movie with me fell asleep watching it need I say more, and we were all in our teens in early twenties, so you have been warned about thiss dvd buy at your own risk"
5,Great movie for anyone,"This is a great movie, with a great plot, with great actors,who can greatly portray great characters. Patricia Arquette plays as aantagonated young hairstylist who is struck with the stigmata, the wounds of christ...just because this movie deals with the church and god and priests and possesion-like themes doesn't mean it is a blatant rip-off of other possesion movies, in fact, I think it is very unique! What a great movie!"
4,Clannad 2,"Clannad, over the years, has changed alot as a band. They've done alot, and been together a long time. One thing that hasn't changed is their integrity, and that goes for their second ever released album, Clannad2. This album has some of the first signs of their experimentation with jazz and rock into the Irish traditional, and a passion in many of the performances that is incredible. It is a favourite of mine because of their integrity and skill, in spite of this being so early in their career. The arrangements of the pieces(which are all traditional) are fresh and full, especially for the time period(mid '70s) They helped plow the way for many other artists coming out of Ireland, such as Altan, Moving Hearts, and U2 with their ""fusion"" sound. This album comes highly recommended."
5,Their first album!,"""Hot Girls - Bad Boys"" (1985 Ariola CD 610 519) is one of their best and hit albums!The most popular tracks are:L.O.V.E. In My Car 1984You're A Woman (I'm a man) 1985Pretty Young Girl on my mind 1985For Your Love 1985P.S. Their best album was ""Heartbeat""(1986 Ariola CD 258 017)."
1,Crap,"This doesn't work. Intended to connect my computer to my TV, and was disappointed. This is a toy. Does not work. Screen comes out as static and only static."
1,VGA TO COMPONET,BOUGHT THIS CORD TO HOOK LAPTOP TO TV BUT NEVER WORKED. IM SURE CORD IS FINE JUST SETTING ARE HARD TO DO FOR HOOK UP.
1,Does not work with LCD,I tried connecting this to my LCD from my laptop and this did not work. I have to sell it now.
1,!!!Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought this for my computer to connect to my HDTV. hooked it all up. and it didn't work. so i tried shutting down my computer and letting it detect it on start up, still no dice. went in and tried to manually switch over. no luck. trying new ideas over and over for about an hour and a half, to no avail. It clearly says in the product description that it hooks up a computer to an HDTV, and it doesn't.every review on here points the finger at disappointment, don't be fooled, this product is junk.Don't say I didn't warn you..."
2,Not What I Wanted,I thought I could use this directly from mt laptop to the TV but it didnt work. You need a convertor to do so.
1,RIP-OFF!,"After buying this seemingly innovative product, I realized that there was no chance it would work because the signal that comes from the computer must first be converted into a signal that can be read and understood by the RCA input and this wire does not do this. This wire will NOT allow you to just plug into your television from your computer and get a discernable picture."
3,Not what I expected.,"Like other buyers, I did not read the description fully. I'm sure the product works well for the purpose intended. Seller has great shipping time and price for the product. Unfortunately, it was not what I needed."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Value","I love the price and the length, however after several attempts to use this prouct with several TV's and computers from flat screens to cathode rays and from laptops to desktops, I could not get this product to work."
5,Works thats good :),I hooked this up to my xbox that outputs component. I wanted to display onto a monitor screen with VGA and this did the trick. I am pleased with it.
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought the cable to attempt hooking up my uverse to a monitor and it didn't work. I then tried to hook up my laptop to my Toshiba television and did not work (somthing the product description says should work). Also, cable was not as appeared in picture (the 3 RCA connectors were thicker than those pictured and barely fit on my devices)"
1,Doesn't work,"Bought this to connect my laptop to my TV and it fails miserably. Tried connecting to a digital projector, same failure: lines, squiggles, but no discernable image. Used another cable of the same design by a different manufacturer and it worked fine. Junk. Don't bother buying this one. You really do get what you pay for. Go to Radio Shack and get one that works even though you will pay 3x more for it."
1,Not so hot,"Trying to use my LG TV as a secondary monitor for my Toshiba Laptop. I could tell that the picture was there but it was hidden behind flashing, distortion, and incorrect colors. Didn't work at all for me and will be returned promptly."
1,Dont waste your time and money,"If you are trying to connect your laptop or computer to a TV that only has component inputs and no VGA inputs, this cable WILL NOT WORK. I should have read the reviews before I wasted my money on this. You have to buy a transcoder or converter box instead, which will convert the VGA signal to a component signal.Repeat, under almost NO circumstance will this cable let you view your PC or Laptop on a TV screen.SAVE YOUR MONEY (Or spend $150+ on a transcoder/converter box)"
1,Doesn't work. Waste of money.,"I spent hours trying to get this to work; I am pretty computer/tech savvy (within reason), and I just couldn't do it. I even went as far as to take my computer up to Best Buy. they tested it on theirs, worked great. I ended up just purchasing a double headed VGA. That worked immediately. The TV, my computer, and a different cord worked immediately. I read something online about the actual conversion from VGA to component not being the optimal thing to do anyway, and in most cases won't work. The picture quality from the double VGA is great, no complaints."
1,Did not work for me,"I was trying to hook up my ""old"" laptop to my HDTV so I could view my laptop on my TV. I picked this because, visually, I had the proper slots for it. The red/blue/green fit into ""Component One"" on my TV and other side fit into the ""monitor"" slot on my laptop. I switched my TV to Component One and I switched my laptop to view the ""monitor"" but I could not get this to work. Obviously, I'm not very high-tech but this seemed to be exactly what I needed but I cannot figure out how to get it to work. I tried a different cable with a newer laptop and it worked fine. Unfortunatley, neither of those items belong to me.Other than that, I received it very fast, it was well packaged, and it was exactly what I ordered."
1,The cable does not work.,This cable does not work and it's not worth the cost and effort to return it. Don't waste your money.
3,sorta worked,"I ordered this cable to use with a dell monitor I had laying around. unfortunately the cable would not work with the monitor because it was too old. I hooked it up to a newer monitor I have connected to my computer and it worked but was badly tinted green. no adjustments would get rid of the green. so, it sort of works, but not well."
3,Need converter to use this cable for PC to HDTV,"Using for a long distance, had to purchase additional converter as I didn't quite read up on what I was wanting/trying to do."
2,Not for my computer,"I bought this cable to connect my older Compaq laptop (loaded with Windows XP) to a projector. It did not work. I tried everything I could think of, with no luck. It didn't even work between my new flat screen TV and the projector! The projector works, because it works with other devices and cords I have. No complaints about the Amazon seller. Very quick delivery. Right now, I just feel like I wasted my money. But, who knows?? Maybe one day in the future I will get it to work with something."
1,Didn't Work,"This cable never worked. I tested it on my tv and my projector, used different laptops and even another cable a friend had, everything worked except any configuration with this cable. Save your money."
4,the audiotape is like a different movie!,"I wish someone reviewed audiotapes of novels. I've been listening to the unabridged 10-tape version of the novel and am astonished at how the movie's focus (all that I was familiar with before) comes from the tenth tape -- up till then it's a comic novel about Aurora and her suitors! This is the ideal novel to assign for a film-writing class. Maybe it's a tear-jerker, and maybe the movie is about a tough mother-daughter relationship, but that's not what I heard on the audiotape. The accents on the audiotape also didn't match my memory of the movie. Lots of Dolly Parton type voices (which was entertaining) and the General sounds more like George C. Scott than like Jack Nicholson). Kind of like listening to a different movie to listen to the audiotape, and a very enjoyable experience. I drove around doing errands I hadn't planned to do, so I could keep listening."
4,Terms of Endearment,"I am having mixed feelings - this is one of those rare occasions where the book just doesn't quite live up to the movie. The book did an excellent job of painting a picture of Aurora and everything that she is, however, the movie carried a better storyline. Also, the absence of the ""Astronaut"" was greatly felt, as he added so much to the movie version of Terms of Endearment.*SPOILER BELOW*Even though the character of Emma wasn't too greatly developed, I still found myself crying over the scenes at the end. :("
3,Vapid and uninteresting,"In the preface, this author makes a point of saying he understands women. I beg to differ. Both main characters (as well as the variety of male characters) are shallow and uninteresting. Emma is hardly given a voice. I read this book after seeing the movie and I have to say, probably for the first time in my life, the movie version was better than the book."
2,"Well written, but a struggle to finish","Larry McMurtry is one of my favorite authors, a true literary genius; however, I must admit some of his work is trash, like this one. It is hard to care about the a soap opera of self inflicted woes by such unlikable people. I forced myself to finish it, but don't find it memorable at all."
5,"we laughed so hard we were crying, it was a blast.","THIS IS A GREAT PARTY GAME.The bogus answers that players make up are just as unbelievable as the real answer from the game.You never know where it's coming from.We laughed so hard, we were crying.Better than the original version and way easier to bluff to than Malarky."
5,The Movie Questions Rule!,This game is so much fun. We have been having Balderdash Parties for years now. I'm living in China now. Teaching English. We have 5 or 6 English speaking friends and some Chinese friends that speak great English. We have Balderdash Game Nights 2 times a month. The games last for 8-10 hours. You an play the game seriously or you can make up the most outrageous definitions and watch your friends read them. The best ones are the Movie Titles. Get this game.
5,A great small group game,"We've played this (though the version we got in Canada was called Absolute Balderdash), and regular Balderdash. I prefer this version because there are five categories instead of just words. All of the items that I've seen are really obscure so there is little chance of actually guessing the answer. This becomes a really fun game if you have a group of creative people. When you do, some of the answers they create are even better than the actual ones."
3,Bring back the original!,"When I saw they had come out with ""Beyond Balderdash,"" I panicked, because I knew it might be hard to find the original, which I had played once years before and had meant ever since to buy. I did manage to track down a copy of the original (a dusty copy pushed to the top shelf with overstock). We played it at Christmas this year, and all my family wants to buy it. The ""new improved"" version would not interest any of us. We like words, all of us rarely or never attend movies, and except for acronyms the other categories don't sound that interesting. The whole point of this game is that it's a WORD game, not Trivial Pursuit. The new categories make it a whole different game, and I wish the company offered a choice."
2,"Okay, not that great.","I love the idea of a bluffing game. It takes TOO long to play though. You got to write the bluffs, read the bluffs, pass them around, collect them, etc. It's a pain. MALARKY is a much better bluffing game. Better questions, better game play. Don't waste your money."
5,Great Family Game,A game that brings out the best creative thought. It's always a surprise who's answers are read. FUN!
5,I was surprised at how creative I could get!,"By far and away my favorite game in the past two decades...right behind the game ""Sorry"" when I was seven. I love it. Most recently played it with a group of friends who didn't appear to be the ""game playing"" type. We all had a ball and have made it a regular part of hanging out"
5,The best things in life are (almost) free,"This is a board game version of the classic home-made Dictionary game. We have played with a wide range of people, and a real mixture of ages, and found that even children can participate on an equal basis. This game encourages creativity, thinking, and discussion, and as a bonus, is really funny. The game is easy to learn, moves at a quick pace, and gets everyone involved. The process of playing the game is fun, with very little focus on winning. It is a very sociable, lively activity, in contrast to a game like Scrabble. Highly recommended as a family alternative to watching another rented movie."
5,Lots of fun for everyone,"this is a great game. it is funto play with the biggest group of players possible. it is a game fulll of laughs and everyone enjoys it. It is good as a family, a party game or just a rainy day gme. no matter where or when you willl enjoy this game."
3,Not as good as the original Balderdash,"We have found the wacky word definitions of the original Balderdash to be more fun, as there is more opportunity for humor in the wordplay. The mental switching among categories in Beyond Balderdash proves somewhat disorienting. The ""what happened on this date"" category is more fun for people who actually have a sense of history."
5,Better than Balderdash,"Beyond Balderdash is much better than Balderdash. The definitions are weirder along with the new movie titles, peoples, dates, and initials. I don't know when I laughed as hard as I did at a board game before. It's great because the silliest definition usually happens to be correct. Every family should own this game. If you play it and don't laugh than you must be the grinch!"
5,Tons of fun,"I'm not usually a fan of board games as I'm not competitive and others in my family are. But proves challenging enough to even the playing field, such that I don't feel like I'm falling behind my competitve family members.One of the best games I've played in years."
2,Not as Fun at the Original,"Being a big fan of the Original Balderdash, I wasn't impressed playing the new ""Beyond Balderdash"". I was expecting something closer to the ""Original"" with words and didn't enjoy the new categories. It is a good game on it's own merits, but beware lover's of the original, expect a different game."
4,"Great Game, Buy it from [...]",This game is fun. I really enjoy spending time with my friends. The only problem is that if you buy it online you pay around $60. I bought one off of Amazon and when it got to me the seller left the goodwill sticker on it and the price they paid was $2.99. [...]
2,Disappointing Follow Up,"Looking for the original ""Balderdash"", I bought this game, thinking it must be as good or better. The original was one of the most fun games I've ever played, but this one, with its multiple categories, was a disappointment. The new categories, of movie titles, dates, acronyms, etc., somehow diluted the momentum of the original and missed the mark for creativity and hilarity that the was a consistant hallmark of its forbear. Playing the new version, we eventually only played the ""definitions of arcane words"" category. Anyone have a copy of the old version they're not using any more?"
3,FUN game.,"We really like this game. HOWEVER, I must tell you that MALARKY is so much better. It is faster, more fun and simply more interesting. Balderdash was fun, MALARKY takes it to a new level."
5,My Family is Crazy for Balderdash!,"Balderdash is a wonderful game for all ages! My family plays anytime we get the chance.(my aunt has the game) My favorite round I played was the word ""kakkerlak""-an albino cockroach. The funniest part was my grandfather couldn't find an answer, so he wrote a lack of kakkers. This is a wonderful game if you want to learn vocabulary. It is worth the cost.PS-Happy Bluffing!"
3,Bravery.,"This story is about overcoming fear. Also a family-bonding theme. One of the firemen imagines fire as a living monster, which is depicted as such in the cartoon. This did not seem to bother my children."
3,Great Title to sell this book,The title of the book is the only thing I found to be irresistable.It did have some information but I just felt like it leaves you short. We all know that a good offer will get the phone ringing. Maybe I should use that title with my offers! Oh yeah maybe that was what he was saying. I got it now.
5,Excellent product!,"Excellent product!! Would buy from this seller again. Concise, to-the-point directions/advice to come out on top over your competition. Very True what he has to say."
3,Not just Marketing - really hits your business' core,"When I first read the book, here's that I thought: I loved this book. The basic idea is for a business to develop a 3 second line that shows a potential customer what value you offer. There's a rough formula along with examples for how to create this, and there's also a lot of description of what this line is NOT. HINT: 99% of advertisements fail to meet the criteria. What I really love about the book is that it really gets to the core of the business and what your value proposition is, instead of just being scammy marketing that you can throw on top of any mediocre business.On second thought, it's a very very simple read without actionable items. It was interesting, but ultimately my business is no better off for having read it."
2,"Over Hyped, Under Delivered","The book has good principles but does not help shape your ""Irresistible Offer."" I hoped to walk away from the book with a strategy to create an irresistible offer and I was let down. A good overview, but falls severely short of addressing the reason I purchased the book in the first place- to create my own irresistible offer."
2,"Same info, different package","If you've been around online marketing, you've probably read all this stuff before. For the newbie, it has a lot of information, but you can probably find it elsewhere for free, if you have a few hours to search around the net. If you have a mailing list, this tells you things you can do with it, but you probably know them already. If you don't have a list or contacts (joint venture partners) with a list, it can be frustrating to hear what you can do with one. my two cents.. I would save your money by skipping this one."
2,no bullets in my gun,"This book didn't even begin to help me. I was really bored, too. no fundamental principles to glean, and no techniques to learn. I think I got to chapter four, maybe."
2,Regular for beginners,"Stop here!I'm disappointed with this book.It simply has no novelty.May be useful for those who never made any kind of structured product launch.But, I am shure that Amazon has better books on this subject.I worked with this subject for more than 10 years and say that it is not a good one."
3,Good sales tool,"The title is the quintessential sales pitch, good refresher. I have had my sales team read and they learned from it."
5,An Outstanding Book!,This is the best book I've ever read on marketing. I was planning a new campaign and I'm sure glad I found this book before I started. Using the ideas in this book guarantees my campaign will be successful.Thank you Mark!Paul Smith[...]
1,Give Me a Break!,"Fortunately for me I checked this book out of the local library. I've read many books on sales and marketing, and this is by far one of the worst books on the subject I have ever read. The author made a couple ""good"" points but none of them was anything new that you cannot find in any number of other books on the subject. Mr. Joyner is REALLY ""selling the sizzle without the steak"". I don't get the high praises this book is receiving. All I can say is purchase this mediocre book at your own risk."
2,Ugh...total rehash of old material,"I cringed as I read the book. Joyner is trying to re-package 15-year old material on writing sales letters as something new. If you've never read a book on writing sales letters there's something here for you. If you have, there's nothing but a lot of hype."
3,Not what I had hoped,Sorry guys and gals but I must go against the grain here. I was not enlightened at all with this book. And I have read a lot on this concept. I must say though that he definitely practices what he preaches because he used the same principles in his book to lead people to buy it.
4,Excellent and thought provoking,"I found this book really enlightening, both from a business and a personal perspective. Mark's writing style is relaxed and friendly which made the book an easy read. It is also very clear - no room for ambiguity. I especially liked his comment on Think and Grow Rich - it has certainly made me think about reading a book versus acting on the information shared in the book."
3,Read the other 3-star reviews before buying,"There is a real lack of meat in this book. The stuff that's good isn't new or original, and the stuff that should have been new, original, and exciting was largely glossed over or not covered. [...] Joyner's book was the other one and it was a huge disappointment. Save your money."
3,Good overview of the forms and solo practice steps.,"Too bad this tape did not show the real world application of techniques. Any martial art looks good attacking a padded bag. However, the knowledge and expertise of Mr.Jeng was very evident. Watching this tape does give one the urge to seek out a teacher."
1,BOO!! Thumbs down for the Placebo!,When asked does this product work:I feel nothing when I take this product as I am in the third week of taking it and have lost only 2lbs. which I think was done naturally not through this product.Were you the only one who tried it:No I gave it to my wife to try so that I was sure it was not just me she said she did not feel anything when she took it either.Reviews are good for this product:Must be the company putting up these reviews because this stuff did not work at all for me or my wife.
5,okay,"I have read this magazine for many years, I enjoy the articles and the layout of the magazineIt is a good magazine"
1,RENEWAL,"The magazine is good I just don't like the fact that it was renewed so early and automatically took the money from my account. I tried to correct this very early on with no success! Very upset with the whole process, not the magazine. : ("
1,Never again,I still have not received this magazine. I will order directly from the publisher next time. Luckily it was only $3. Ordered on 11/30/07. It is now 2/1/08.
1,Magazine Renewal,I was told to go to Amazon and order Redbook and it would automatically renew my subscription. Now I'm getting duplicate issues every month. I'm very unhappy.
4,It's Redbook,"Well, you know, it's Redbook. It's not the world's most interesting magazine, but it gives me something to glance at in between diaper changings, feedings, and so on and it was a great price."
1,Piece of junk - too much advertising and no substance,"This magazine should be handed out for free, I am not surprised currently going for $3 because it is basically only full of ads. Out of a bulky 225 pages to browse, ony 25 pages of articles, out of which only 10 pages of interest to me....I would definitely not renew my subscription in 9 months!!!"
1,Very Shallow,"This is a very shallow magazine. The artickes have no depth, the titles and cover proclimations are very misleading (such as a child's ""Miracle"" recovery which was simply that he got better when the Dr.'s found what was wrong and gave him a bit of medicine, or a ""Quirky"" post-baby weight loss tip that was breastfeeding). It's full of useless ""diets,"" scare-of-the-month health issues that aren't even real news, and other such drivel. In trying to appeal to everyone it doesn't appeal to me at all!"
1,If you like Advertisements This Magazine is For You,"I use to read this magazine back in the eighties and I remember that I had enjoyed it. Recently I decided to subscribe to a few women's magazine,this being one of them.Upon receiving the first issue I could see this wasn't the same magazine I remember.Every other page is an advertisement.No wonder it's only $8.00 for a subscription they don't have to pay any staff,there are little to no articles.Very disappointed, I should have picked up a copy at the supermarket first to check it out before subscribing.Oh well, at only $8.00 it isn't a huge lost, but once the subscribption runs out I will not be renewing.I can recommend Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, and I was pleasantly surprised by an improved Family Circle."
3,Ok,I bought this subscription because I love to read and it was available at a great price. It targets married women with kids. I can relate to some of the articles but not all. Overall ok.
2,Subscription issues,"I received a letter from the publisher last week stating that because of the overwhelming response received with this offer, my first issue will not be mailed until February 2012! This situation should have been anticipated and I am especially annoyed as this is a renewal and not a new order."
3,Still waiting - Not Unhappy yet...,"Was told to wait 6 weeks before I see the first copy...So, I'm waiting to see it.No negative feelings yet..."
1,buyer,"Received 2 or 3 emailsfrom them that it was being processed. never received the item that i ordered. Amazon should not let these people on the website. Still waiting for my new unopened item., while I am out my money."
3,red book,"Not sure if its a good magazine yet, but the price i got it for was great so i thought i would try it"
3,Disappointment!!!,"I like the articles, but I'm very disappointment with the magazine. I noticed they been publishing the same articles over and over again. I just got my March 2011 magazine and the articles are the same one from couple months ago. It's seems that they only thing they did is change the cover. I look forward reading the new articles, and not same ones I read couple months ago."
3,Redbook,"I received my December issue 2 weeks after getting the January issue, I guess because I'm a new subscriber. So far I find the magazine to have more advertizing than content. Not sure if I will subscribe again."
3,Should've done more research!,"I like the magazine, but it's oriented to a different demographics... totally my fault. But overall, a good read for the month! worth the price"
5,I love this magazine,"I love this magazine. It has great articles, advice, and contests. I love their recipes too! I definitely recommend!"
1,ddkhouse,"There is not enough hours in a day to sit and waste your time reading this. Maybe in a doctor's office, when you don't want to look at anything else. But not if your a busy person and time is limited."
3,Disappointing delay,Purchased a two year subscription of Redbook magazine on October 31st. Expected first issue in December. Instead received postcard from Redbook stating my first issue would be the February issue. Postcard said demand greater than copies available from latest printing. ?? Why not print more? Will wait but will keep this in mind for any renewal.
1,Don't know how else to rate,"Since I still have not received this magazine I cannot rate the service. I ordered this two year subscription based on the magazine in my dentist's office, in October of 2011. January 2012 is here and I still have not received my magazine. Based on this experience I would have to give Hearst Publishing no more than minus one on the rating scale."
1,Not Getting this Magazine,"I wanted to inform all, I am not getting this magazine, not received a single copy so far. I can only comment if I get the magazine."
3,Good Magazine,"We just received this magazine a few days ago. So it took over a month to get the first issue. Not too happy about that, but they did let you know it might take 4 to 6 weeks for the first issue to arrive. The magazine is not too fancy. The pages are very thin, but the articles are pretty good so far"
5,Great Deal!,This deal for the magazine was too good to pass up. I'm an avid Redbook reader and it makes me happy to know that I only paid for the price of about 3 magazines for a whole year's worth of magazines. Thank you for the great deal! :)
1,"*Unrequested Renewel*, Mostly ads, little substance in articles","I subscribed for $5 for one year through Amazon, but even as cheap as that is, I'm not happy with this purchase. I feel like I bought junk mail. The magazine goes in the garbage the same day it comes.I was quite surprised when the end of my subscription neared and I got a letter from Redbook stating they will AUTOMATICALLY renew the subscription UNLESS I call the 800 number they provide. The letter states that if I cancel the (unrequested) renewal I will still have to pay for any issues I've already received.Rather than play the game of calling their solicitation center and paying for something from them I didn't agree to purchase, I plan to regard any unsolicited material from them as a gift. A trash-bound gift, but a gift nonetheless.I will no longer buy ANY magazines from this publisher because I don't like the way they do business. From now on, I'll read the magazines I do like in the library."
3,NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE,Redbook magazine is not what it used to be. Good thing I got it cheap. Don't bother with this one.
1,Never get my money back and very bad customer service,"For the first time I subscribed to this magazine --- A few weeks after I placed my Amazon order on Nov, 2009 then I changed my mind and I cancelled this Redbook-2 years subscribtion.Then I got an email ""Thank you for contacting Hearst Magazines"" saying 'it is beingsent to a Customer Service Representative for proper handling'I checked back on Amazon several times and it's always shown up 'cancellation being processed'.I do get another magazine on same order and other one on different orders on Amazon as I ordered as well but I never get my money back or even any of one issue of Redbook!!!By the way, I don't like that they don't provide you any phone number and it's very difficult to contact the customer service by only mail or email contacts(which always say do not reply!).After three months that I never get my money back so I need a live person to talk with!"
2,sexy and hot,"This was anticipated to be a 'general info' magazine. Two months' issues were sent on two consecutive days. An abundance of articles were on sex. Both have lots of items about 'pleasing your partner' sexual satisfaction, etc. There is a dearth of recipes, home decorations or general read. I'm sorry that I have a 2 year subscription, though the price was right."
3,Won't be renewing,I used to like the magazine but have decided not to renew this year and a big part of that is the amount of advertising in the book.Recommending products and pricing it out is still a form of advertisement and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of make up and beauty products. Some of the articles I liked but it's been hit or miss lately.Stripping for cash was a little over the top but most of the time I flip through it and throw it away the same day I get it in the mail. Sad really.In the future if I see an article worth reading I will pick it up at the grocery store but I don't plan on subscribing again.
2,disappointing!,"As a fan of Amelia's books for 20+ years, I was looking forward to reading this book to my eight-year-old son. I was disappointed in the book, though, and my son seemed to feel the same way. When we usually read Amelia books we both end up laughing at her silliness, but this book seemed to force the humor and ended up not being funny at all. My son did enjoy opening the flaps at first, but after the second one, everything just became too predictable. It was liking using the same joke over and over and over, and it got tiresome very quickly. I wish I could recommend this book to someone, but I can't. Go read the other Amelia books, but leave this one on the shelf."
2,Not user friendly,"This program is fine for pre-made puzzles, but I was never able to figure out any way to enter words to create my own puzzles. The box said you could, but I couldn't find a way to do it."
3,My Favorite Kids Cartoon,I was really excited when I saw I could buy my favorite kids cartoon on dvd ! However the only downfall is that this dvd doesn't play on my IMac computer :(
1,I wonder if this video is bootleg...,"Oh my gosh, I almost laughed when I put this video in. You would have thought I bought it from someone at the barbershop! This quality is as poor as it gets. I seriously wonder if someone recorded this with their personal video camera while at the movies."
4,Words are the answer,"Being the lead creative at a web consulting company in Japan I've noticed a lot of the problems the author mentioned about putting appropriate importance on good copywriting for the web. His advice has helped me a lot to keep my copy human, energetic, and infuse it with unique attitude. Avoid the corporate speak! Most importantly his advice about getting to know the user's voice in order to communicate in a convincing way. The same kind of book should be written for design! This is a great book for any designers, management and copywriters alike."
4,Must Read for Search Engine Marketers,"Anyone involved in Search Engine Marketing should read this book. If more of my peers in the industry would read this book, the Web would be a better place. My only knock on the book is that it is fairly basic and would appreciate a new edition at some point."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This book is not action-oriented enough for me. There is too much philosophy. I was looking for a book with ""power words"", examples, and how-to's. I wish I could give it higher ratings, but it really bored me."
3,good book,"Working in PR you learn that words can be everything so it is important that you not only use the right ones but in the right way. This book is a good working tool for anyone who works with words. If one is in PR or advertising, this book, along with Guerrilla PR Wired, is a must have."
2,Bad for Business,"Usborne says the whole heavy graphics thing is bad for business. Has he seen a movie lately? Star Wars had more graphics than an B-2 Bomber! Special effects are everything. There's this guy, Michael Levine, who argues that you gotta connect with the customer in Guerilla PR: Wired. And I agree!Okay, Usborne, yeah, the customer's eyes might roll up when he sees my latest web designs, but you know what? They'll remember what site! That means they'll remember the product!"
1,Not much of value,"This is more of a survey of copywriter's woes and the general state of online copywriting for Web sites and newsletters and for email. Not much meat and not much that can be of any real value to anyone short of those with very limited experience on the net.If you're an experienced copywriter or someone who knows their way around, don't waste your money on this book.I found it amusing how Usborne said that hyperlinks on the web page distract the visitor and should not be used while the author of Persuasive Online Copywriting by Bryan Eisenberg, Jeffrey Eisenberg, Lisa T. Davis is all for it.In fact, there are no hard and fast rules and we copywriters are not at all sure which way works. My personal belief is that each site is different and that hyperlinks can and do work if you write your scan words just right. But neither book addresses this issue.A novice would be, I think, better served by reading Bob Bly."
5,Copy is critical for Search Engine Marketing - Nick Knows!,"Three years from now the most important person on your web team will be your copywriter. Increasingly, Copy - or rather finely tuned, accurate verbal content - talks to search engines and customers alike. Talented writers who understand your market AND the search engines are already both rare and valuable. As the Search Engines become better and better at ""understanding"" the copy on your site, you'll be increasingly dependent on good copy with content; and increasingly free of tricks and scams to achieve high rankings on search engine results.How do you learn about writing copy for your website. You read Nick's book. Period."
5,Highly recommended for folks with a punny bone,"Years ago, I enjoyed this movie many, many times with my 6-year old daughter. We both laughed so hard that it hurt! But then we are tuned into the corny humor that pervades the Asterix series - puns, bad accents and everything. The movie also explains why tea is a popular drink in Britain. I am planning on giving this video to my 7-year old son now."
5,"Great Video, Read the Books Too","Asterix in Britain is a wonderful video that mixes in a bit of history, some great fun, and a healthy dose of puns. The latter are more prevalent in the comic books than the videos though. The authors poke gentle fun at most everything from tea to turf. Throughout the series, an appreciation of cultures and cuisines lurks in the background. The translators have done a marvellous job in bringing the stories to english."
3,Complicated look at piracy,"This book is a very detailed discussion about golden age piracy in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, and Asian waters. If you do not have a general background of pirates, this book could be rather difficult to grasp, as it is a compilation of essays and articles from scholars and experts. Great for college classrooms."
5,Collaboration for change,"This is a fabulous book that crosses all content areas for teachers and has implications for all professions. Larson discusses the power of collaboration, how it impacts the individual, as well as the impact for greater change for the organization. This book has been a powerful resource for my research work and the cooperative work that is developing between my colleagues and me."
4,A flashback of the best,A great collection of dance music from an era where the videos were as much fun as dancing to the music.
3,Could Be Worse,The information in this dvd is very intresting. I borrowed it form my girlfriends father and viewed it over a period of two weeks. I think that one of its draw backs is that it tends to be similar to a microsoft powerpoint presentation. Over all I was happy with the time that I spent viewing the DVD's found them to serve their purpose but with a minimal amount of visiual stimulant.
4,Suprisingly good,"I was pretty set to pooh pooh this book, especially after reading about the author and seeing how similar she and her protagonist, Kate, are to one another. After being distracted by this a bit at the beginning, I was able to let it go and enjoy the book. It's well written (though I found the dialog in the present day chapters a bit trite) and well researched, and there were at least a few twists I didn't see coming -- rather, I should say the twists didn't scream out at me from the beginning. The scenes set in the 16th century were great. Overall, a fun and quick read, a good historical thriller; I look forward to her next book."
2,A major disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book. I'm usually a soft touch for books that jump between the present and historical settings (with the notable exception of Michael Crichton's Timeline). But Kate Morgan is totally unbelievable as a character, and is apparently the exaggerated alter-ego (with the emphasis on ego) of the Harvard-educated private-eye author. I found the portrayal of 16th Century London to be interesting, but that's about it. That was five hours that could have been better spent rereading The Time Traveler's Wife or Jack Finney's Time and Again."
1,I really tried to like this book,"I read 185 painstaking pages and just had to stop. I didn't really care about the characters. The plot was so jumpy. Characters were introduced so randomly that it was hard to keep them apart.DaVinci code style, my eye! It's this summer's garage sale fodder!"
1,i would give it a lower score if that were possible,"Pretension without ability, ingenuity, or originality.Buy a real book."
3,A Bit of A Plod,"If Intelligencer's intention was to give us a new Da Vinci Code, it missed the mark. I see in the reviews by other critics, they, too notice the overload of the novel which annoyingly prevents a full development of deserving characters. Seibert is a very good writer and her subject matter is cleverly intertwined between 1593 and the present. However, the switch between centuries many times gets in the way of the movement of the story. On the plus side, it is a very good book for high school students whose instructor I hope requires the historical background.I look forward to more writing from this author. Kudos to her to intellectual prowess. A good challenge for all readers."
2,Boring and Overrated,"Based on the reviews, I thought this book would be an interesting read. The premise certainly sounded interesting. A dash of The DaVinci Code and a bit of The Eight, but this book doesn't come close to being as good as those it's compared to. I found the main charcter to be over the top and predictable, her storyline not even interesting. The flashbacks to Christopher Marlowe and Elizabethan England had the potential to be interesting, but just fall flat. I couldn't even force myself to finish this boring novel."
5,No mystery about whether to read this or not...,"I loved the Intellingencer. It had me engaged from page one. Four hours later I was online looking for the release date for Silbert's next book. For fans of historical fiction, this is a must read. The author does a fantastic job of constructing parallel narratives that are integrated seamlessly. The book is a refreshing change from formulaic knock-offs and variations on played-out themes. Silbert's writes with a historical authenticity that makes the book both engrossing and edifying. I had no idea 16th century England was so messed up! It makes great fodder for her intricate story-line and gives her characters a dimension of intrigue that is rarely found in this dime-a-dozen industry. An amazing first book and well worth the read- I can't wait for the next one to hit the shelves!"
5,"Fast-paced and fun, yet so smart and informative as well","I flew through this novel. I've never read a thriller that was so well written, creative and thought provoking. I loved reading about Elizabethan spies, ciphers and black-market arms dealing, paired with a parallel espionage tale set in the present day. You learn so much turning these pages, while being entertained non-stop...I was especially fascinated by the discussion between the modern-day heroine, Kate Morgan, and her client, about which was more dangerous to pursue in the Renaissance: state secrets or God's secrets, and why. Marlowe got killed for one of those dangerous pursuits, Kate says, but which? That's one of the mysteries revealed in the final chapters, as Kate deciphers Marlowe's final intelligence report. Speaking of which, I thought the way she figured out that particular code was fun and really interesting."
2,Confusing book,"Advertising for a new book comparing it to the ""Da Vinci Code"" is not a great recomendation in my opinion.That success of that overblown drivel is a mystery to me. Leslie Silbert is obviously a rookie. The historical part of this book holds some interest, but the modern day sleuth and her escapades are just inane. I am sick and tired of all these incredibly attractive medevil experts who just happen to own a black belt in some martial arts category.And the bad guys are all dark and sexy and brooding and give me a break...Even the least pretentious thriller{ and this one certainly isn't that modest} must possess the modicum of reality and common sense. Well to make it short, this lame attempt doesnt have any."
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"This is a great idea, badly executed. I was very interested in the historical mystery of Marlowe, but the writing is so awful it clouds the drama. There are so many good books out there, this one is NOT worth your time."
1,"Wow, this is bad","This is what the publishing industry has come to: Someone with absolutely no experience or talent can write a derivative, two-dimensional and utterly pointless novel and GET IT PUBLISHED AND ON THE BESTSELLERS LIST just because some other untalented hack managed to grip millions of readers with a conspiracy theory!! Ye gods!! There are tons of good books out there, people! Read Scotch River by Linda Little! Read A Short History of Indians in Canada by Thomas King! Hell, read a cereal box before you read The Intelligencer!"
1,Horrible Book,"I ordered this because it was compared to Mary Higgins Clark. There is no way this book or author could compare to MHC. Although the storyline sounded interesting, it not only drags on with an endless history lesson given by the characters, but one would get the impression that everyone in the 1500's was either gay or had no moral character whatsoever. The language and sexual content in this book is not something I want or should be needed in a successful novel. Mary Higgins Clark has been writing books for more years than I can count, and she has never needed to put smut or language in her books to have them pouring off the shelf. After reading about 1/2 of the book, and getting way too many sexually explicit pictures in my head, I had had enough, and decided to forget trying to finish it. Too bad you can't get a 'money-back-guarantee' on books.This author has alot of work to do to present a book with decent substance."
2,First Book Blues,"Leslie Silbert has great potential -much like her heroine, Kate Morgan. This was a neat premise for an histroical novel/detective story. The research is obviously meticulous in both the story lines. There were plenty of characters both fair and foul and there's even a gentleman burglar. Good stuff. The writing itself left something to be desired but that would have been more easily overlooked if Kate Morgan could have been more three-dimensional. She was too slick. Like a magazine photo. This is often the case with autobiographical characters, especially in first novels. Flawed characters are both more believable and more interesting. A novel isn't a job interview. When your reader asks ""what is your worst characteristic?"", you don't respond ""i'm a perfectionist overachiever"", you show us the whole bloody mess. Otherwise, why should we care?"
5,amazing -- exciting and clever,"this book blew me away. it's that rare combination of page-turner/spy thriller that actually makes you feel smarter for having read it. the way she weaves jet-set modern NYC private-investigator hijinks with brooding elizabethan england -- i couldn't put the book down. maybe it's the author's real-life PI experience...her harvard education...her good looks...whatever it is, keep your eye on leslie silbert. highly recommended."
3,Less makes more,"It's understandable why there are such varied responses to Silbert's work. As a mystery, it is very good. The prose is very good.However -- and it is a big however -- the dialogue is often weak and sometimes quite irritating. The author is rather pretentious when talking about Kate and that actaully makes Kate a rather flat character.Knowing less about Kate's accomplishments would make her more human and therefore less annoying. As it is, 50 pages into the book and the author's got her almost able to walk on water."
2,"OK plot, cardboard charaters, ho-hum writing style","One of the blurbs on the cover compares this book to ""The DaVinci Code,"" and I should have taken that more seriously and not bought this book. Its only good feature is its intricate plot. Even that does not deliver a really sharp finale. There was such potential for really wonderful characterization here, with the book's back-and-forth story line between present and past, but none of the characters come to life. They are presented as no more than types, with nothing to make them human or interesting - very much like ""The DaVinci Code,"" in fact - and so I didn't much care what happened to any of them. Sadly, despite the author's credentials, the writing style is also poor, with trite, cliched descriptions and little to perk up the tone.If you read for plot only, you'll probably like this book. If you want some actual good writing to go with the plot, try something else."
3,Not really biker shorts,"These shorts are great if you are merely trying to wear something sleek, but I was disappointed because they are not true distance biking shorts. There is no padding protecting the bum or thighs. Really, I would consider these good aerobic or running shorts."
1,Heavy grey heart,"This is the third book of the series I actually read. After following Dione on her adventures with the wolves, I just couldn't give a d*mn about her granddaughter, Rezsia.Sure, the girl was understandable, as a city girl suddenly bonded to a wolf and having no experience in the great outdoors. I actually kind of liked her bond with Gray Vlen.But most of the book was just too predictable. The love interest at the end was not just trite, it was ridiculous. Too much bio-this and bio-that, with conspiracies with rival biologists (I suppose?) and annoying details, like names of new characters and offhand references to their relations that don't add to the plot.I can appreciate Tara's love of wolves, and I certain share that sentiment, but this story just didn't hook me and pull me in. Maybe if Rezsia got her own series, it might have been worth the $6.99 I originally paid for it, but no more of this series, period."
1,Lost it's Focus,"When gossip and fluff is your bread and butter, you should stick to knitting and not attempt political advocacy. The hits on Sarah Palin were a pathetic attempt to harm the McCain campaign."
2,The System is Too Slow,It is rediculous that an order placed on-line should take 4-6 weeks to be delivered.
1,US WEEKLY ARE A BUNCH OF IGNORANT RUDE IDIOTS,"I WORKED THERE BRIEFLY AND THEY'RE RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS AND HAVE NO CLASS. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOME OF THE STORIES THEY'RE ACCUSING OF MAKING UP ARE TRUE. THEY DESERVE TO BE SUED AND STOPPED. ALL OF THEM ARE REPULSIVE, I'M GLAD I GOT OUT WHEN I DID!"
1,...,"This magazine is fun to read, but should not be taken seriously.I got a trial from Amazon for free, and my problem is that I could not cancel the subscription. I can't find a number to call on their website, and I've contacted them by email many times. The number on this page is for a ""men's magazine""..?"
3,found a much better price elsewhere,"I was so psyched to find this $33.50 offer for Us Weekly, considering I buy it at the store for $5 every week. Then I got a Groupon for a $5 yearly subscription -"
5,Quick Delivery,"I was very excited to see one of my favorite magazines half off for an entire year through Amazon local deals! Even better, after I completed the voucher and placed my order, delivery was very quick - my first issue was delivered within a few weeks (I was expecting a month or two). Thank you!!"
2,Not the Same Magazine,"I used to really like US magazine. I have been collecting every issue each week for several years now. But wait! Has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year? Where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities, movies and music? There's no more than a thumbnail's sketch of info on anything now. It's all photos and quickie hype. It has no more substance. What happened to this good magazine?"
1,Has Seen Much Better Days,"I used to really like US magazine. I have been collecting every issue each week for several years now. But wait! Has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year? Where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities, movies and music? There's no more than a thumbnail's sketch of info on anything now. It's all photos and quickie hype. It has no more substance. What happened to this good magazine?"
5,Everyone needs a guilty pleasure!!!,"I can't help it! I know that I should be reading something more educational, but I adore US Magazine! There is something about it that makes me swipe it off of the shelf at the grocery store every time a new issue comes out! I love reading about the latest celebrity spoofs!US Magazine is literally overflowing with the latest gossip on every celebrity you can think of. From what not to wear, to pregnancy alerts, you can read all of the juicy stuff! Every week they write about all the new movie deals everyone signed up for, who has gotten married, arrested, pregnant etc.! I just love it.One of my favorite features about US is the pictures of stars caught reading it! I love the fact that not only do I have to have my weekly gossip fix, but so do they!"
1,katzenfutter,"great magazine, but there is no way to stop the subscription. I will disengage of Amazon...forever if this situation remains the same! Trust me!!!!"
5,The Best in This Class,"I am a college educated, professional woman and I still love this magazine. In fact it was my guilty pleasure while I was attending college and didn't have time to sit down a read a good novel. US Weekly has some of the best photographs of stars compared to the other mags on the newsstand (ranking only second to In Touch at times). US Weekly does have the best content. They have more content than In Touch and less of the stuff that I don't care about like People magazine publishes. US Weekly is a steal at the subscription price. So, why don't you check one out at the newsstand and subscribe if you like it as much as I do?"
5,US magazine subscription,"I didn't realize that you could buy magazines on Amazon.com. I researched prices on-line and found that they had the best price and that there weren't any gimmicks or catches. Originally the website said that it would take up to 12 weeks to receive the first issue, but it was less than 2 weeks before my first issue was in the mailbox. I am really happy that I decided to order the magazine through Amazon. It was super easy and fast!"
2,Poor delivery to Vancouver,I've ordered the Us weekly for a 3-month period. I have missed 3 issues already with 2 months in. Not impressed with its delivery to Vancouver!
4,great magazine!,I gave this magazine as a gift to my sister but I also love it! Magazine subscriptions are a great gift idea!
3,US Weekly,"Great Magazine. Celebrity gossip is my crack, there could be worse addictions! The company/publishers are hard to contact if you have a change of address!"
1,trash,"This is one trashy magazine. I suspect most of its subscribers are ""accidental""--I wound up with it after purchasing something at Best Buy three years ago. It was supposed to be free for six months, but of course they do not bother to contact you to see if you'd like to continue. They just keep billing you, and I was too busy to deal with it.Recently I was motivated to seek out their address and write for a cancellation. Hopefully that will get rid of it."
1,Not Worth Reading,"I can only agree with this: ""The photo-heavy US (Magazine) mainly focuses on celebrities and their love lives -- mostly false reports and half-truths."" [...]"
1,The Company that Produces US Weekly needs to go out of business,"I personally do not like 'hit' pieces such as the front page and article about Sarah Palin. I do not like any media that distorts the truth or tells incomplete truth in such a way as to distort the meaning. I do not like any media with a bias. I vote with my feet - I will NOT buy this product, or any other produced by that company.The only reason it gets even one star is that the review mechanism does not allow me to give it none."
5,I'm the New Gossip Girl,"I love gossip magazines and Us Weekly is the BEST! I couldn't afford to purchase the full year subscription, nor could I afford to purchase this every week, so the 6 month subscription was the perfect option for me. With all the stresses of a full time job and being a full time graduate student, it is great to open this magazine and live vicariously through the lives of the stars.There are a lot of choices out there for entertainment magazines, but Us Weekly seems to have the best exclusives and scoops directly from the stars. I trust that what I read on their pages is true to their best knowledge and not purely made up fictional stories that I commonly see while waiting in the grocery store checkout. The stories are great conversation starters because everyone loves good gossip. My favorite time to read is while working out on the elliptical. It takes my mind away from all the pain."
1,Can't buy what I want...,I find it really hard to believe that I can't purchase a 6 month subscription as a gift without an automatic renewal.I don't want to spend $70 on my gift. Who does that?I don't want to be sucked into a setup that automatically drains my credit card until I realize that a subscription I am not going to receive is still arriving. Who does that?I don't want the extra burden of remembering to cancel this in 6 months. Nobody does that (which is why the companies structure their sales this way).Why can't these people get a clue and allow a customer with good money to purchase what they want.It is a shame that a good magazine is getting a bad rating because of their sales structure.
5,Junk Food for the Brain!,"US Weekly is the best ""escape"" from work and chaotic everyday life! I love it! Unlike the ""Enquirer"", this magazine shows some respect for the stars that it covers, which I admire."
2,US is just a fancy Enquirer,"I have been subscribing to US Weekly for about a year and a half. In that time, I have never seen an issue without several pages of Jessica Simpson. I have to wonder; does Jessica donate money to this magazine? She seems to dominate the whole magazine, each and every week.I won't be renewing my subscription. I'm tired of Jessica and the untruths that US Weekly supplies."
4,US Weekly 1 year subscription...,great deal---52 issues for under $34...can't beat that. also the first issue came less than 30 days after i placed the order which was a plus!
3,US Weekly Magazine,"US is one of my favorites of the weekly entertainment magazines. You can't believe everything you read, but I feel confident that they are trying to be truthful in their stories. You do see some of the same pictures and stories that run in all the weeklies, but this is the one that I choose to read. The frustrating part is that, as a subscriber, I receive the magazine several days after it hits the news stand, making it sometimes feel like old news."
5,Fave mag!,This is my favorite celeb magazine! Much better to get it here and pay much less than at the checkout!
4,Fun purchase!,"It was a very creative gift, the receiver loved it and she's having fun reading each issue. Every issue has been on time so far."
2,USWeekly,"This magazine takes your interest off everyday life and puts it on the inane and over the top people. That they resemble us and have the same foibles makes it kind of interesting. But really, it is just fodder for people who have nothing else to do(not saying much for me). I am already sick of it, but still I enjoy seeing the next issue. Go figure!"
2,Hidden auto renewal feature,"The product was fine, however I was not pleased that my credit card was charged for an auto-renewal. I thought I opted out of any auto-renewals when originally ordered but there must have been fine print that missed. I then had to go in and cancel the renewal and have my card reimbursed. This will keep me from purchasing any more products through amazon."
4,"Shallow and cheesy, just like hollywood.","My wife loves this magazine. Its chocked full of candid celebrity shots, and stars doing regular everyday things. Stars complain about the paparazzi, but really, they have no right to whine. After all, they get paid millions to show off their faces, they have given up their right to privacy.US magazine's theme is that stars are just like ""US"". They go to eat, lay out on the beach, and get their hair done. Thats what the magzine is about. Some call it shallow, but Hollywood IS shallow. You are only as good as your last film, and the sets are just sets.If you like glitzy, fake celeb interviews, read something else. If you want to look at stars doing everyday things, and people picking on their fashion faux pas... ths is the magazine for you.A bit pricey for what it is, but hey, we have to support the paparazzi."
4,A good and inexpensive teaching tool,"If you are an instructor of English Composition or an introductory literature class, this slim volume, edited by Robert DiYanni, is fairly comprehensive and represents a wide range of subjects and styles. Much lighter in weight and price than most anthologies (and, face it, how many pages of those fat anthologies do you really teach from?), TWENTY-FIVE GREAT ESSAYS is extremely practical. The anthology includes writers like: James Baldwin, Stephen Jay Gould, E.B. White, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Ehrlich, George Orwell, and Maxine Hong Kingston.I don't always agree with the commentaries that precede each essay, and I don't find all the ""Possibilities for writing"" questions after each essay that valuable. Still, it is a worthwhile and practical collection that will appeal to teachers and students alike.Rocco DormarunnnoInstructor, The College of New Rochelle"
4,Pretty Interesting,I had to read this for an Essay writing class in college. It has some really good examples of essays that can inspire you to write some essays from a new outlook.
4,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"THIS IS A LOWER BUDGET MOVIE THAT PUTS OUT!!! GREAT PERFORMANCES BY THE ACTORS THEY DID GOOD, THE STORY WAS USUAL, BLOODLINE IS WORTH A CHECK IF YOU LIKE MOVIES OF THIS STYLE!!!"
4,great fun but at least one hotspring was missing,"book was perfect for drive across California and Nevada. It opened a new world of adventure. Unfortunately, though, one (of the two) hotsprings we drove to (outside of Unionville) appears to have been bulldozed over. We found this out after an hour or so of driving and another hour walking around looking for the hotspring. But we wouldn't have missed this adventure anyway."
2,Not So Hot,Very bland and writing without soul or true appreciation for the environment. Directions poor. Not worth your money. Prefer Gersh's Hot Springs book.
3,Mystery unsolved,"This is the worst Church Choir Mysterie I've read because at the end, the person making the wax carvings is left to guess about. It is a major plot point, so I found it a trifle irritating as a reader. I also wish the series wouldn't introduce so many characters just for one book, like Nancyalma and her shiftless brother, ""the greedy auctioneer."" I just want to warn other readers of the series."
4,Star Wars Episode I Naboo Space Shooter,"My 27-month-old son got this as a Christmas gift. Although it's recommended for Children 5 & up, he has mastered the on/off switch and the shooting mechanism. He plays with it under supervision because he's unable to load and unload the discs by himself and also because the Naboo ship has pointy (yet soft) edges. He plays it for long periods of time and never gets bored. The only negative thing, the discs are very easy to lose if you don't pay attention to where they're being shot."
3,a good deal BUT...,"you might get a better deal by calling The New Yorker subsciption office directly: 800-825-2510. My mailed renewal notice price was $89.95/2 years, but they offered me $50/2 years when I called and spoke to a CSR."
1,Just did a two-year on line for $59.99,"Love the magazine. The rating is because of this price. Folks don't be fooled!Prompted by the poster from 2009, I called customer service at 800-825-2510. Couldn't get a $50 rate but did get $59.99 for two years just by asking what was their best one year rate ($39.99) and then the two year rate.Thanks for the tip.Posting this now so folks know it still works."
2,Cost depends on where you live,"I always renew by calling the New Yorker. For the past four years, I've paid $25/year. This year we moved from a highly desirable zip code to a less high-profile one. When I went to renew I was told $49 was the best rate available. On a hunch, I changed my address back to the old one and the next day, called to renew. $25? No problem (I should have renewed for several years). I then changed my sub back to the new address. Worked for me."
4,good writing but...,"I have been a reader for 20 years, but am considering canceling my subscription (I did this once before when it became a Vanity Fair look-alike under Tina Brown). I think the writing is exceptional. My complaint is that the issues have become thinner (with an embarrassingly small ""Double-Issue"" mid-August). The articles are shorter and edited to end at the bottom of a page, which sometimes breaks the article's flow. It is full of advertising, which pays the bills, but now seems to have squeezed out some of the writing. The articles also do not seem as essential as they had in the past. The political writing is great and the movie reviews by Lane and Denby are the best you will find."
4,"good magazine, but after purchasing ....","After purchasing on Amazon, the New Yorker sent me a direct mail to renew for $5 less than paid on this site."
4,A joy to read,"I remember first reading the New Yorker while a freshman in college. It was more than a little intimidating to read a magazine that seemed to challenge the reader with so much great fiction and nonfiction. This is, in short, one of the best literary magazines in print.Why four stars? The cartoons are not funny. I know this seems petty, but the magazine seems to congratulate itself on a regular basis on the witty cartoons featured throughout each issue. They just try to darned hard to be witty and clever. The result is something like a dry exercise in humor without the actual laugh."
5,Love the New Yorker,"Love the New Yorker and decided to get my own subscription. To my delight, it started coming much more quickly than what Amazon said. Maybe 3 weeks instead of six. What a nice surprise"
2,Not what it used to be,"The writing, content, and cartoons have all gone downhill over the last decade. The New Yorker of 1999-2003 was essential reading -- engaging, thought-provoking, clever, wry. Today's New Yorker is tired. The cartoons, once clever and relevant, are now either obtuse or worn out (how many more ""stressed out"" montages by Roz Chast must I flip past?). For my money, I get broader and deeper political coverage in The Economist, more innovative writing and photos in The Paris Review, and sharper liberal politics/commentary in Harper's. If it weren't for the occasional serious news story (most often written by Seymour Hersh), I'd scrap my subscription."
5,"Yes, the New Yorker","If only I had time to read this magazine the way I did ten years ago, savoring every paragraph. The issue about the events of September 11, 2001, that befell New York was without a doubt the most splendid writing on the tragedy anywhere. David Denby is the only film critic writing today who I trust, and the sports, architecture, and art writing are equally brilliant. Nobody needs to know what I say; this magazine speaks for itself. There are also some great books about the fine history of this excellent publication, the best one by Brendan Gill - ""Here At the New Yorker."""
2,Very uneven,"I have several criticisms of the New Yorker:1) Editorials--It's like reading Pravda. Tell me the title and I can tell you what will be written. In brief, EVERYTHING Bush--Evil terrible. EVERYTHING Obama--Great.2) Snob articles--Who wants to read puff pieces about Nora Ephron and her buddies?3) Seymour Hersch--He is accurate maybe 50% of the time. In many cases things he wrote were proven to be wrong and we never get a followup or correction."
3,New Yorker Magazine,"i love this magazine... it keeps me in touch with the beat of NYC....(that is the beginning where they have blurps on what is going on in the galleries, cinema, concerts ets).... On the other side... the essay writing is hard to read... I think that is because the writers are paid by the word... BUT the cartoons are GREAT!!!"
1,How to be a snob?,"Exactly. While the previous reviewer to use this title matched it with a full 5-star rating, I don't. If you want the most pompous view on everything no one ever asked about, then go ahead and buy a copy. I thought perhaps an informed, enlightend editorial tone would have been a nice perspective to bring into my home. Now, years later, they won't stop sending that rag no matter how many times they claim it's my final issue.In short, not a fan. My advise to you: get one issue off the newstand and see what you think. If you're like me, you'll hate it and never go back."
5,magazine subscription,I am so happy to have subscribed thru Amazon. The magazine delivery started in 2 weeks.
2,"Great mag, not great price.",There were several online prices that match Amazon at 40 per year. I called The New Yorker directly at 800 825 2510 and got a price of 45 for 2 years. This is a great mag. Call the above number and get a great price as well.
4,Smart writing on engaging topics,"I currently subscribe to the New Yorker. Generally I find each issue contains 2-3 ""meaty"" feature articles really worth reading, a bunch of listings for NYC cultural events & a fiction piece. I could care less about the last two items, but the magazine is worth getting for the feature articles alone. Malcolm Gladwell (author of The Tipping Point) is my favorite regular contributor, though the writing is uniformly of high quality. The articles often deal with quirky topics you're unlikely to find anywhere else."
4,"Bias abounds, yet a good read","As another reviewer recently said, the bias is indeed laughable...unless I suppose you share the viewpoints of the very liberal editors. Reading the front matter of the current issue, which contains short snippets of current affairs editorials and such, I was easily able to refute every point the author was trying to make. It is the same hyper-liberal sludge that is so far to the left that is easily passes for a joke.Otherwise, despite the bias that may permeate the magazine, the main articles are lengthy, very well written, often unique and interesting, and intellectually satisfying.While some viewpoints are amusingly bias to the sensible reader, the rest passes for excellent journalism."
4,I'd rate it a 5 except for liberal editorial slant,"I generally really like the articles. I've subscribed for about six years, and there are some article that were so excellent I'll never forget them.Two quibbles, though.1. The editorial staff is extremely liberal. I really avoided all of the Clinton-Monica justification stuff, and how it really all was a Republican conspiracy to put Monica up to it, and how she lied, and how the angelic Clinton was and is a saint. This left-wing refusal to view reality almost made me cancel my subscription.2. I think Tina Brown was the worst thing to happen to the New Yorker. I liked the articles that went on and on and on, and sometimes tested one's patience. However, it was almost always worth it to slog through some of them. The articles on John Paul Vann in Vietnam and mud-flows in Los Angeles (really!) were so excellent I think they are some of the best non-fiction writing of the twentieth century."
5,New Yorker rocks and Amazon made it easy,I love THE NEW YORKER and wanted to give it as a last minute gift. It was easy and inexpensive with Amazon. This is the second subscription I've given through Amazon and will continue subscriptions through them.
5,"Clear guide to HR and IT, with examples","This book gave us an inside view to PeopleSoft's benefits and faults. It was straightforward and helped everyone on our team, from managers to DBAs. We bought one for everyone on our IT team, and our functional staff as well.The book is organized well, and contains detailed information about all of the HR functions, including many things that are not mentioned in the manuals. It is best used as a reference tool-- I can quickly look up a complex concept and have it explained clearly with examples."
1,Not for a Newbie,"I applied for a job that uses Peoplesoft. I knew nothing about it so I bought this book. I still know nothing about it. I had hoped this book would be user friendly and explain what it was and the basics of how to use it. I have used many types of software and databases. This book made no sense to me. I am still waiting to hear on the job and I still want a user friendly book to explain the basic how to's of using Peoplesoft. If anyone has any suggestions, please post them. Thank you."
4,Clue 50 is Great!,"I have always loved Clue, but I could only play my parents' ratty Clue game from the early 70's with a torn box and a missing revolver. I got this game for Christmas and it is great! There is a 7th weapon, poison, and every peice is so much better! It is a great family game and I really reccomend it."
3,The Tamaarind Seed,"I found this book enjoyable, however, I have, for many years, read far more interesting books by Evelyn Anthony.I am one of her great fans."
3,if you are a fan of Lindberg its ok.,"Quite primitive in everything it has redeeming value in Cristine Lindberg showing her goodies numerous times. Basically all movie is artificial, no imagination, amateurish, high school level etc."
1,"Cap falls of, rubber twists","I bought 5 of these knifes for our workshop, I use X acto knifes all my life, but looking at the many products I have from them, more and more are turning out to be only competitors to the cheap Chinese products. I think they lost their professionalism somewhere along the way, this knife definitely proves that. Looks great, but that's it. The plastic cap is cheap, too hard and cracks all the time, not to mention that it doesn't hold in place on the knife. And the worst part about this knife is that once you use it a few times the silicone part of it gets loose and you have to use pliers to hold the new blade while turning the rear section when replacing the blade because the front silicone part just spins around."
1,cap doesn't stay on,I use xacto knives almost every day. I thought I'd buy this more expensive model to treat myself and I was disappointed. the blade is more cumbersome to change and the safety cap doesn't stay on. Other than hold the blade these are the only two things the knife does. BTW it holds the blade just fine. I'm giving this one away and sticking with the inexpensive one.
1,Cap falls off - safety hazard,"I agree with another reviewer here that said the cap falls off. It is poorly designed. It does not ""click"" into place, but relies on friction to stay on. The surface area that the cap grips on the shaft is only about 1/8"" deep. Even a slight lateral force will tip the cap off of the shaft, exposing the razor sharp blade. This is definitely a safety hazard. In one motion, you could knock the cap off and cut your hand. Don't ever carry this in your pocket. I was keeping the cap taped on, but eventually I told myself it wasn't worth the risk of having this thing around. I threw it away -- and I feel good that I probably saved me or someone else from a nasty cut. Exacto should pull this thing from the market until they redesign the cap -- and they should recall all the units already sold. Don't waste your money on this expensive version -- get the basic version that has a secure cap."
5,Valuable for space buffs.,The general American public knows so little about the Russian space program that all of this information will be new. The author gained the trust of Gagarin's wife and friends and in some cases gained access to information and stories that have never been officially revealed. This book left me thirsting for more.
4,Good read,Less about space and more about how rough life was under Soviet rule. Still fascinating slice of the space age.
4,Starman Review,"Good Book. Detailed the triumphs and tribulations of the Vostok space program as well as the life of Yuri Gagarin. From his youth fighting Nazis through his global celebration as the first human in space to his embarassing downfall; the authors spent a great deal of work interviewing friends, family and researching once secret archives for their fine work."
1,Flawed,I was looking forward to reading this but was ultimately disappointed. The writing is not really very good and it lacks any sense of tension or drama. Gagarin does come off as a remarkable individual. Overall this is not a strong version of what must have been a highly dynamic time.
1,terrible,"This book contains many fascinating statistics about the USA, and presents the work of an array of information designers. Unfortunately, much of it is overblown, visually chaotic, and more concerned with ""looking cool"" than with conveying data to the reader. I hope no employer sees this as ""what information design is"", since it does nothing short of degrade the profession."
1,RS Wurman violates every principle he claims to hold dear,"This is info-porn at its finest. Wurman has violated all of the best practices he espouses in InfoAnxiety, InfoArchitects, and the Access guidebooks. Shame on you Richard.The overall organization is incomprehensible, the content is inaccessible, and the visual style is cacophonic. It does not tell me what I want or need to know.Do not waste your money here. If you feel like you must own it; wait a year and find it for $3 in a remainder bin somewhere. Spend your hard earned dough on Tufte 1 & 2, or Schneiderman's Information Visualization."
3,"Excellent information, bad organization","There is a lot of excellent information in this book. To have all this information in one place is wonderful. But, to echo some other reviewers' comments, the omission of page numbers and an index was an incredibly bad decision.You get a sense from the intro that some of these ""information architects"" are just a tad bit full of themselves, which I mostly find amusing. Their attitude about their work may explain the lack of quick-reference details like an index--if the graphics are works of art, well, do you really need an index in an art book? Here is where amusing can become annoying, because the overall goal, getting information to the people, is impeded.Then again, as I write this I think: with no index, is one more likely to read it through, rather than relegate the book to the reference shelf? This could be an advantage to the lack of an index. But it's not a big enough advantage to outweigh the loss of usefulness."
3,Unique and Filled with Facts and Figures,"""Understanding USA"" is a unique publication...a ""...celebration & a visual demonstration of questions & answers leading to understanding."" Brimming with data, this book answers questions many readers might never have even considered.Utilizing many different and distinct presentation formats, ""Understanding USA"" offers readers an interesting way to learn facts and figures related to the USA as of the date of this book's publication (1999).The data, however, is not organized in the most straightforward manner, so I found this book more of a ""browsing"" publication as compared to a more traditional ""reference"" publication.I recommend this book for the curious reader...for those readers interested in data on the United States in well-referenced and tabulated numerical format, I recommend an additional resource:Statistical Abstract of the United States 2007 (Hardcover): The National Data Book (Statistical Abstract of the United States)."
5,what's the deal with the funny box...,"What's the deal with the funny box that surrounds one of the bombs in the War & Defense section of the book? I looked to see if it was a ghost image from the preceding page, but it there was no matching image. Is this another example of those designer snobs thinking that they can pull the wool over the eyes of the innocent public? Do they really think that they can get away with this? And what's the deal with all those pictures? If I look at more than one page I get confused and suddenly I can no longer recognize family members and I start to sieze. Damn designers!"
2,Surprize part,I purchased what was said to be a new item but when it finally arrived it appeared to be opened and used. I was skeptical that it was maybe a used item and possibly removed from another vehicle. It did work when it was installed into my vehicle. After I posted my concerns about the part the Supplier sent me an email with a major attitude about his product. He did not mention why it took so long and the extreme cost for the part and cost for delivery. Part worked but I would never recommend the supplier.
1,Awful,"Awful. Like a very long soap opera, but not in a good way. No happy ending for our heroine. My two friends absolutely love this book, but I couldn't make it past the first 50 pages. Just a series of sad and horrible things happening to the heroine, at least that's all I could determine after reading the first 50 pages."
5,The Best Book I've Read in 45 Years of Reading,"I first read ""A Prologue to Love"" when I was a young girl and itremains the best novel I've ever read. I love Caldwell's rigorous intelligence, crisp avoidance of sentimentality for pure and honest emotion, and the sheer force of her language - she would have made a formidable lawyer or stateswoman. The book is sweeping but in the end a simple parable about how we can be blind to what is truly important and enduring because of fears born of ignorance, abused innocence and deprivation of love. I didn't understand the political commentary until later readings, but when I saw it, it just added another layer of richness to the story.Read this book!"
4,Great fun on many levels,"This 1948 British creation caused a huge outcry upon its release due to its cold-blooded brutality and sexuality. The uproar merited a four-page article in LIFE magazine, titled, ""London Can't Take It."" Once the viewer gets used to the English actors attempting American accents (often with hilarious results) and misguided attempts at American gangster dialog (""You croaked him!"")it is actually quite a lively-paced and intriguing film. Cinematography is noirish and excellent. It has been beutifully restored and deserves a new audience."
2,Gold plated disco,"This is a good compilation, but don't buy it if you want to use it with any modern playback method. It will not load into your mp3 player without a hassle. This disc is copy protected and for those of us with Ipods that makes it worthless overpriced junk. Pretty silly if you ask me. You can make a compilation yourself. Who needs to pay and get something that won't work."
3,Many better books!,"There are many better books than this one for mastering Swing. John Zukowski's book from Apress and Topley and Geary's books from Prentice Hall are much,much better and in the case of Zukowski and Topley second volume also more up to date. Note that I think Zukowski's book is the best solution if you want a fairly consise treatment of what you need to know but Topley's two books (if he ever revises Core JFC) would be the ideal comprehensive solution since Gearey's has given up finishing his ""encyclopedia."""
1,Not a good Swing guide,"I am extremely disappointed with this book. I thought that since this text was written by some of people responsible for the development of the java language that it would be very reliable. This is not so. There are some simple code errors - I found one in the second example in the text in their description of the GridLayout command. These kinds of errors will cause your code to not compile, and for a new learner makes learning difficult.Further the code examples are usually incomplete and you will find yourself constantly going back and forth through the text in order to write a complete application. I mean that's good for a Dungeon and Dragon's book but not for an instructive text.In closing, I will just say that this book is not a good investment for persons trying to become proficient in the art of swing programming."
3,"Good book, but you can find the same information online","I do use this book as a reference, but I was dissapointed to see that all of the material and lessons are available on line for free."
3,If you know how to use it you'll be fine.,"This book is good and bad at the same time. It's not something I would recommend for someone trying to learn swing. It has some good stuff in it to read but it is not a book to read and learn from. It's more like a reference. It's order, well it has no order let me put it that way. Things are all over the place. At the end of the day even if you want to use this book you should just look it up online. It's available on Sun's site. It's easier to read it online since it has links jumping around from subject to subject and section to section. Hope that helped."
4,Simply and easily explained complicated material,This is the best Swing book that I have read thus far. I used it as a jump start to object-oriented GUI programming. It shortened the learning curve considerably. Kathy Walrath and Mary Campione are excellent authors. Their writing style is very clear and understandable.
5,This is a great book,This is a book for all to read. Whethe you are a programmer or an analyst this book is a must read.
4,the fastest track to writing GUI using Swing...,"If you know Java, that is, Java without the GUI, and you want to write applets or programs that use GUI components (buttons, menues, text boxes, etc), pick up this book and you'll be writing your own GUI applications in under an hour. Don't bother with the ""Differential Equations For Dummies"" or with the Web Programming in 21 Days type of books -- Many of them use the older GUI and others, even though they do use Swing, use the older event handling model. If you want to program GUI, then do it right: The book is systematic and accurate and has plenty of examples of code. Use this book for textbook and/or reference."
4,"Great reference for beginners, but...","When I started building GUIs in Java, I found this book to be invaluable. However, most -- if not all -- of the content of this book appears to be available online at java.sun.com. If you are new to Java and developing in an environment where you can't get to the Internet or you prefer hardcopy material then this is a great buy."
2,This book is not necessary to learn Swing,"Be aware that the material in this book is a cut-and-paste of Sun's Java Tutorial, which is available free from java.sun.com.The swing docs as well as the tutorial alone, are insufficient to learn Swing. The material is very skimpy, and does not explain the event handling and update interactions.A few of the examples in the Tutorial were useful, but most were trivial. The book is pages and pages of generally simple code. If you do not have a fast connection and would rather have a book handy, I would still download the Java DOCs from Sun and install them on my local disk instead.What I found useful were the demo examples that come with the JDK. I am still looking for a good swing book."
4,much better then stock speakers,The boss speakers sound alot better then the factory speakers that came with my car good balance of sound I wish they could hit the bass tones harder
1,Poor high end,"I was very disappointed by the lack of the high end response. They sound blah. No crisp high end. No more Boss speakers for me. Years ago, 2 and 3-way Jensen speakers always sounded great, so I'll try theirs next time. These weren't driven by a low end car receiver either."
1,review,"the speakers are really really crappy, the power is about 10 times less than the advertised one. not to mention that one was already broken wehn i installed them in my car, it probably broke duruing shipping. i hooked them up to a DUAL car player that puts out max 4x55W, and the speakers should have had 175W each...more than enough...so no way i could have burnt them with the stereo. so....all looks, no power"
4,Excellent study in propaganda,"This is an old (1966) book purchased through one of the many find venders linkable through amazon. Now that we're watching a perversion of Keynes run the US economy - to ruin - it's interesting to see how those of us college educated in economics in the 60's were spoon-fed Keynes, or better, what the academic community promoted as Keynesian deficit spending on steroids.The book's content is transparently biased, but I give it four stars for being a fine example of 60's propaganda."
5,HOG FLAG,This flag is awesome. It's freakin huge! I am very pleased with its construction and it looks great hanging on a wall. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Not what I expected...,"and nothing i really fancy. Sounds all the same. If you want a real KILLER ALBUM go and buy Naive Art or - for fans of the newer Red Flag - the fabulous Megablack Box Set including their Masterpiece ""The Crypt"". Thats hot!Steve"
4,Repairman Jack part ??,"I enjoy reading about Jack and generally like all novels by Wilson.This may sound nuts but I wish Repairman Jack did just that. He has methods and a mantra unlike any other good guy taking matters into his own hands to squash the bad guys.But the supernatural aspects do not work for me with Jack. I dislike the far-fetched Other in this context.Get the bad guys Jack and leave it at that.Without reviewing past Jack novels this one ""clearly"" leaves us hanging and we know the serial shall continue.Maybe in the next book Jack can vanquish the Other and lets move on to other (no pun intended) things."
2,No rubber stops for the square box,"The product itself is fine. I personally just purchased the square boxes to be used for verticle jumping excercises, light weight, large, durable. I was thinking the rubber feet for these boxes would be included, but they are not. They don't even have rubber feet for these....so the boxes slide all around unless you have them in the grass or on carpet that is secured to the ground."
1,Mack Gorman Steel Toe Work Boot: POOR!,"Husband bought these for work. After 5 months of light duty and a mild winter, the boots have come apart at the seams. At first they fit good and felt good, then they fell apart. These are NOT a bargain. They're a ripoff!"
2,Try another boot,I waited two months for my size to become availible and now that i have them i am disappointed. There are not enough lace up ties for one and the two there are to small. And wahts the deal with the stupid lace buckle on the sides. All this makes the shoes impossible to tie tight and to remain tied. The only plus is that there is plenty of room for feet and toes insided the shoe.
4,The original alternative.,"I'm gonna say that, unless VU is your favorite band of all time, this collection will please most anybody. It's obviously twice the set the single disc collections are. It sounds great, it's 30 tracks, and has a nice booklet within. Every song they had that was anything close to a hit is here, and then some. Plus a few live tracks, a couple from Nico alone, and hey, as a casual fan I find no flaw here. The Velvet Underground is a band I can listen to in the midst of any mood. They're a rockin', alternative, classic, mellow band. You know what I mean. Thanks Lou Reed, thanks Nico, thanks VU."
3,Great Brake Pads But Set Doesn't Fit 2004.5 Volvo S40i,"I have good experiences with Wagner Thermo-quiet brake pads--good value and quiet as advertised. However, I found the the MX838 set does not fit my 2004.5 Volvo S40i 2.4L as it has 5 lugs. The MX973A is the correct part (like the one specified for 2005 Volvo S40i). I returned the part and Amazon refunded the purchase price so other than the hassle of re-ordering the correct part and returning the incorrect part, I'm satisfied. If your S40 has 4 lugs, the MX838 is probably the correct part."
5,One of the best childhood films ever,"This is, quite simply, one of the best films about childhood ever made. But then again, to write this film off as a film about childhood is too easy. This is a gorgeously filmed adaptation of Marcel Pagnol's memoirs of growing up and vacationing in Provence with his family. The cinematography is beautiful, and the cast is uniformly excellent. And as a real treat to film viewers, there are no sentimental or treacly moments that can often bog a film down. A friend noted that while I watched this film, I had a smile on my face the entire time. That's the best kind of film. This is followed by the equally stellar but more somber ""My Mother's Castle."""
5,charming and uplifting,"What a beautiful film! This is one of those films where everything works. The visuals are beautiful, the script spare and heartfelt, and the characterizations profound. Can Americans make films like this; where there is warmth and nostalgia but where the humor and the modesty keep sentimentality under control? Forget irony and cliches...this is wonderfully real and exciting."
2,my father's glory,"very boring to me-two men go on a boring hunting trip-one takes his son along, who evently gets very board..."
5,Formidable,A group of lafdies of acertain age who take French at the local SR. Center gather to watch this movie in french with subtiutles also in French and we love it. I have read the book and this movie is so true to Pagnol's writing of his beloved mountains.
4,It grows on you,"I didn't like it when I first listened, but that's not uncommon with CDs I eventually find really interesting. Plan to take some time to read the lyrics -- they are different, fun, and clever. The harmonies are similarly appealing. I would especially recommend ""Cat Fight"" to all feminists."
3,Passenger 57,"this movie was pretty cool, the action was cool, and the story line was ok but what i didnt get was the title PASSENGER 57 what did the fact that wesley snipes was passenger 57 have to do with anything?"
2,"""Bet on black"" - only in roulette!","Mindless action Snipes looks, moves, acts and projects the image of an ex con. Action sequences are not at all convincing. Waste your money on something else."
5,"Great movie, lots of action!","I just wanted to say that I love watching this DVD. It is a great action movie. Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne deliver outstanding perfomances. I love the fight sequences. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do. It's well worth the money!"
4,Very Gripping,This movie is filled with suspense. Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne delivery excellent lines and are very convincing in their roles. The actions scenes are just totally extreme. I just love the way Wesley Snipes boards the plane from underneath. This movie is very to the point as there are few dull and wasted moments. Not quite perfect due to a couple of unbeleivablle happenings but overall a winner in my book.
5,Great Action Film on a plane.,"Some called it a Die-Hard Wannabe, but i think this is great.Westly Snipes is a great actor in my opinion, but this is one of his best. It's about a Security Officer who boards on a airplaneand suddenly it gets highjacked by Criminals, it's very entertaining and great stuff.If you like Executive Descision, Broken Arrow and Con Air, rent this one."
4,Passenger 57 summary by Jack Rosagro,"An infamous terrorist has evaded capture for a long time by being extremely clever and ruthless. Things get interesting when he hijacks a plane carrying famous security expert John Cutter, who isn't about to stand this sort of thing. END"
3,simple but entertaining,"La película no muestra un argumento demasiado original, pero rebosa acción y con esto cumple su objetivo. Tenemos delante nuestro un producto que lo podemos decretar como ""Fast-cine"", con un protagonista astuto, sobervio e instruido en kcikcboxer, quien se las tendrá que ver contra un peligroso terrorista que ha secuestrado un descomunal boeing 747, y con este coctel empieza la lucha.Todo el mundo sabe que el malo morirá y el bueno se quedará con la chica. ¿Alguna vez ha sucedido lo contrario en el cine de aventuras?Muchas obras maestras parten de tramas similares.Para ver esta simple película no es necesario que seas un tarugo; pero debo añadir que básicamente contiene:patadas,cabriolas,explosiones,tiros y algún que otro chiste(carece de sexo).Con esto ya la tenemos lista. La recomiendo a los amantes al género de acción."
4,Passenger 57,"I like the ""Action"" and the fact that the hijacker is some snotty nosed most-likely Leftist Brit,along with a young looking and hardly recognizable Elizabeth Hurley(Who is more beautiful now,Hugh Grant is a homo.)However, there is some bad editing or at the least incompetence on the film maker's part. There is a shot that bothers me where you see a 1980's Corvette Convertible from afar driving on the road surrounded by water then in the next scene it is a Red Corvette but a 1991!(Yes this is trivial but a big goof, one corvette has the Wheels and different nose/rear and the other has the aero look and ""Cusinart"" wheels!,any Car Guy or Corvette Guy would notice.)Also,the Hick-Exploitation and the jab at republicans from Sizemore,other than this the movie is pretty good even if Snipes is now a TaxCheat(correction was,also part of some weird martial arts cult thing)."
2,Horrible acting.....is this a parody??,"A plane just landed after a mid air, open-hatch struggle, while dead people lie all over the place, and an 85 year old lady is smiling, doing an Arsenio Hall ""Woo woo"" impression. This kind of camp would be great if you were watching the Batman TV series, but not a movie that was marketing as a serious action/drama.Snipes and the main villian put in decent performances, but for most of the cast (especially the local cops), the acting was weak. The formulaic plot wasn't much better."
4,"5-Star Action, 3-Star Plot","Passenger 57 is a 'no-brain needed' 90 minutes of fun. If you liked Die Hard, you'll enjoy this simplified knock-off while also realizing why Die Hard is the Babe Ruth/Michael Jordan gold standard of the genre. Wesley Snipes shows off his two expressions of disgust and lust in almost every scene, and the quips and kicks keep coming as the plot revs along like the train in 'Unstoppable,' but with little regard to logic.If you are a movie snob, STAY AWAY!!!! This flick is for fans of fun who don't turn up their nose at bad cinema that's entertaining."
3,Okay but a little too much drama,"Decent movie; but some of the characters are a little much. Otherwise, I'd watch it again."
3,Check your brain at the video counter before watching 57,"Passenger 57 is one of those slick action films that is best enjoyed when the viewer checks his brains at the video counter. Don't mull over how ridiculous it is for the feds to put a terrorist (who blows up planes)aboard a plane for extradition. Don't calculate how Wesley Snipes can defy every law of physics in an effort to ""sneak onboard [the plane] without a ticket"" as it is literally in flight. Don't think about those and many other hangar-sized logic holes in Passenger 57 and you'll be good to go. Just sit back and enjoy the action (which is first rate) and the view (which is first rate too with the lovely Elizabeth Hurley as one of the terrorists and the equally beautiful Alex Datcher as the heroine). Whatever you do, just don't think!"
3,Like the Enquirer,"I wouldn't say this book is a stomach-turner. Rather, it reads more like a salacious novel, or some daily celebrity mag... You read it and think to yourself - could that REALLY be true? It seems so gossipy in some spots you wonder. But, it is an interesting read. The parts on Mussolini and Napoleon do read very well, the parts on Hitler and Mao a bit over the top. Some of the inferences - like all of the Nazi elite being gay - seems too much for me. Plus, I've read quite a few biographies on the individuals in this book, and some of the stuff in here is news to me - which makes me question how authentic it is.Not a bad book, and a super fast read. I won't buy any other books in the series, though. If you want to know about the sex lives of these people, I'd recommend just picking up an in-depth biography. These short blurbs on each dictator read more like sexy book reports in comparison."
1,Disgusting,"Although I do not have a weak stomach, this book is one of the most disgusting books I have ever read. Especially the chapters on Mao Tse-tung and Hitler are repellent. The chapter on Mussolini is the only one that has some ""funny"" passages. Il Duce ""rarely bothered with a bed, preferring to do it on the floor or against the edge of his desk. The act was perfunctory. He would not bother to take off his trousers or his shoes. The whole thing would be over in a minute or two."" The book starts with Napoleon and ends with Saddam `Abu Ali' Hussein.In stead of this book, I would recommend Cawthorne's ""Sex Lives of the Kings and Queens of England"". Compared with the dictators, those Kings were decent men!"
1,"Abstract and unrealistic, but OK for pre-teens","Compared to the simplicity of Diplomacy or the richness of Third Reich, Risk is an ""also ran"". It combines the worst of abstractness and lack of detail to produce a game as unworthy of being called a wargame as tic-tac-toe. However, it is a good stepping stone for children just entering the wargaming hobby, but is quickly outgrown. If you're (mentally) an adult, hunt down anything by Avalon Hill that came out before they were taken over by Hasbro."
5,"Risk Early, Risk Often","What a great game! The 40th ed. is worth every penny. If you are a Risk fan, spend the extra and get the 40th ed. The metal soliders will give you a life time of enjoyment. I played this game two years ago at Christmas holiday with my relatives in Denver and became a fan. It is now a tradition (at least for the boys) to 'Risk' at family gathering(s). Great game for the family. Let's get the girls in the game, TM."
5,Grand Strategy,The fellow from Colorado was right. This game has nothing to do with luck. If a person knows what he or she is doing they will come out on top about seventy-five percent of the time. I first started gaming when I was nine years old. This was my first game. Now I'm twenty-six and I STILL play Risk on occasion. It is a classic and a great game for beginning gamers as well as the more advanced.
5,Millgate's critique of Faulker -- excellent,"Millgate is one of the best-known authorities on Faulkner, and this critical biography studies and explains some of the complexities in Faulkner's work. If you've found Faulkner inpenetrable, this book with help a great deal."
3,Want a brief overview of conservatism?,"I subscribed to this magazine for a short time. I was interested in the conservative perspective on political issues. I got bored with the magazine after a few weeks.Though I do not often disagree with the political views presented, I found most of the essays far too short and lacking in-depth discussion of either current events or the conservative slant. I would personally prefer a magazine that is more unabashed about going into great detail about the whys of issues and events, something that spends more time explaining and defending its position. The writers for the Weekly Standard seem to take it for granted that their readers are in complete agreement with them, and bypass argument, effectively going straight to conservative venting about political issues. There is a place in the world for publications like this, but it isn't quite what I had in mind."
1,A complete waste of time,"Since zero stars was not an option, I settled for one. Poorly written, this travesty of journalism demonstrates the problem with the right wing media...their contempt for anything remotely moderate or progressive. If any of their contributors have ever read the constitution it would surprise me!"
1,Sloppiest of sloppy thought from Bill Kristol,"The Weekly Standard is the propaganda arm for billionaires who want all our money, creationists who are too afraid to face obvious facts of science, and endless wars for the benefit of military contractors. Read its article purporting to connect al Qaeda to Iraq before the invasion. It's a sad, funny attempt to create connections that no one else has been able to find. Are they presenting cutting edge journalism, or simply fabricating facts to fit their pro-war agenda? Decide for yourself."
3,Wisdom can come out of madness.,"Like most of Marion Zimmer Bradleys' books ""Two to Conquer"" starts of with an interesting prologue. Unfortunetly after the prologue the story gets off to a slow start. But as The book is read, you become more interested and it goes much faster. The book is very interesting inroducing new ideas about far away galaxies and duplicates of ourselves and everything around us. It also shows how different people can overcome ill feelings tward each, come to terms with these feelings and make peace. There are many other interesting concepts but i wont ruin your fun. Overall this was a very interesting book."
3,back jacket summary,"from the back cover of the 6th printing Daw June 1980 paperback editionCover art by John PoundWhat forces would operate if there were two objects that were absolutely identical in form and substance? This problem has occupied both workers in magic and the scientists of physics and psychology. It is the pivot of Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel of Darkover during the final flaming days of the Ages of Chaos.This is the story of the era when the planet of the Bloody Sun was divided into a hundred warring kingdoms and civilization teetered on the edge of oblivion.It is the story of Bard di Asturien, ambitious soldier-outlaw, and of his opponent, Varzil the good, who struggled to establish the Compact. And it is also the story of a man from distant Terra named Paul Harrell who was the exact duplicate of Varzil's enemy.Two to Conquer is a novel of social forces in combat, of the use and misuse of science, of war, of rape, and of witchcraft."
2,One Size Does NOT Fit All,"While this author does an excellent job of providing personal accounts of having Asperger's, which is a neurobiological condition on the Autism spectrum, there are too many inconsistencies and fallacious claims this book endorses.Autism and Asperger's (a/A) is NOT a disease. Autism and Asperger's are neurobiological conditions that affect sensory processing; communication and often impede social development. The very suggestion that the a/A spectrum is a disease is just not true and is patently ludicrous.While I can't give this work a ringing endorsement, I can say that if it has helped others, particularly in intrafamilial relationships understand what people on the autism spectrum contend with, then it has served a good purpose."
3,Excellent Reference...but....,"This is an excellent reference book for ferret owners...but a bit too cutesy for my tastes...especially the terms she uses instead of the word ""ferret"". My only other concern about the book is, in my opinion, it makes ferrets seem much more messier than they are. I have 5 uncaged ones that have the run of a room, so I know they aren't the neatest creatures in the world...but they don't need the litter box every 15 minutes. Someone without a ferret might very well not get one after reading this book about all the MESS...I wouldn't! The author has at least 20 ferrets--that's a ferret rescue place, not a typical ferret home."
3,Nothing you can't read on the internet,"Its good if you like to read, but all the information can be read on the internet. I enjoyed the read, but found more helpful information on other websites"
5,Great Book,"Very informative book, great price and great dilivery. Really enjoyed reading it and learning more about Ferrets. It has made taking care of them a lot better. I learned a lot that I did not know. Better then searching the net for information."
2,"The biggest, but not the best.","This is the biggest ferret book I have ever read, but not the best. The author apparently is ""addicted"" to ferrets, and does not seem to know when to stop adding to the collection. Her writing is juvenile at times, also. But Ms. Schilling does get the award for the biggest egomaniac author of a ferret book--this is the first time I have ever seen an author write a glowing review of her own book, possibly in response to a negative review. Or maybe she is simply insecure. Authors should not be allowed to write reviews of their own books."
5,The best reference for ferrets - ever.,"Before adopting my two ferrets, there were many things that I was unsure of. What exactly should I feed them? What shouldn't I feed them? How do I litter train them? How do I ferret-proof my house? Should I get one for my lifestyle, or two? Girls or boys?This book addressed all of that, and so much more. I learned more than I could have ever imagined, and now I even consider myself somewhat of a ferret-expert, all because of this fantastic book! Best of all, the book is actually a very fun read. I recommend it to any current or soon-to-be fuzzbutt owner."
3,Good,This a good book to have on hand when you need a reminder as what to do and what not do to when applying Feng Shui.
1,Mad,"My products was suppose to arrive August 23rd, as of today September 1st, I do not have my tea yet."
1,Tasteless Dust,"This is a coarse, dusty and stale tea that has probably been sitting in an Eastern European warehouse for too long.Even increasing the amount in the pot and waiting twice as long will not coax any flavor from it.At least the canisters will come in handy."
3,OK as a first book,"This isn't a bad book. It's a little basic. It might function well as your first book to answer elementary questions about digital printing.I found the sections on color management to be a little thin. If you are looking to graduate to the next level, and want more in-depth knowledge and a better interpretation I'd recommend Photoshop Artistry."
4,"old, but interesting","obviously, the special effects are outdated, but even so, the story wasvery interesting and frightening"
4,Interesting Film on Alien Abduction,"It was great to see this very well documented abduction case made into a movie. I thought that the part where Travis Walton was picked up by the UFO was very realistic, and well done. The part about people's reaction to his abduction was also (unfortunately) quite realistic and believable.He appeared to have set off an automated defense system by going too close to the UFO. Many people who have intimate knowledge of this case think that Travis was dead, and was brought back to life by the aliens; this may explain the unusual length of his abduction.The part depicting events on board the alien ship was not so good, and not in accordance with Travis's report, but I'd rate the movie 4 stars overall, in spite of this. I'm surprised that this movie did not create more of a stir with the general public than it did."
3,Good movie...could have been better,"I looked forward to seeing this movie. Whether or not you believe Walton it is still a good story. The only mystery is why the producers worked hard to reproduce the story as told, but then totally re-wrote what happened in the abduction? It is nothing like what Walton claims to have happened.Look for Walton himself in a cameo in the ""town hall meeting"" scene."
5,Fry In The Sky DVD,This was a great movie and since I live in Arizona and based upon a true story it was especially interesting. It gives the story based on the man who says he was taken aboard a spaceship and also how it effected his friends who were thought to have possibley killed him before he returned.
5,love this movie,"My boyfriend begged me to find him this movie and I was happy I found it on Amazon. Of course he forced me to watch it with him. I was surprised that I actuality loved it since I don't normally don't watch movies like this, but it was a really good story."
5,Great movie,I could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. It is really good and very scarry at the end.
3,...but not the full story.,"As a resident of the White Mountains, I can tell you that there is a lot more to the story than is shown in the movie. My rating of the movie is tainted mostly because I don't think they did a very good job of recreating the people or the area that these events supposedly occured. It's really not that bad of a movie at all and is pretty much worth your time. Just don't assume that it is complete non-fiction."
3,Fire in the Sky,"Fire in the Sky is a creepy movie Loosely based on the book (which I read). the movie is meant to entertain as it's not as in the book or according to Walton,the most scariest scene is the flashbacks and it takes a while to get there. whether or not you believe the story it's up to you,but the movie is one of the most if not the most scariest alien abduction/alien movie."
5,FIRE IN THE SKY ON DVD!! AT LAST!!,"i have always been a firm believer that we are not alone in thisvast universe and the true story of travis walton just fueled mybelief that much more!! yes,the movie does differ from the bookbut still hits hard on the actual event that did take place inthe mountains of arizona in november of 1975...i thought that theactors portraying these people made it quite believable that thisdid really happen! i have waited for the longest time for this tobe released on dvd and now the wait is over!! if you have yet tosee this movie,get it..watch it..and believe!! oh yes..be afraidbe very afraid!!"
1,This video s***s,"This video has almost nothing to do with real story. Some 50%in the movie are lies, horror. Obviously, this video is only based onfact, but it does not represent the truth about that case. To see what really happened, visit Travis Walton home page. I don't think director of video, that Lieberman didn't know everything about this case, so my impression is that he made this video just to scare us and make us afraid of UFO and aliens, which is what some people want, they are trying to make us believe UFO doesn't exist, but if we still believe in them, then they want us to think aliens are evil and bad, which is not true."
3,"This is suppose to be a true story,","snd it may well be. The acting was ok, but too many flared nostrils. James Garner looks good for his age, but, all the suspects seemed to do was take lie detector tests, it was boring. The director should have done more with what Travis saw on the space ship. That was a lot more interesting, as a matter of fact it didn't look all that sanitary for a operating room. The whole ship looked pretty dirty, the aliens may be advanced but they sure are slobs. Enjoy!"
1,Disappointing movie,"The movie ""Fire in the sky"" is real disappointment,since it does not reflect what really happened,but rather shows those extraterrestrials as bad and evil.That's clear intention of movie makers, they deliberatelyavoid showing extraterrestrials as good and nice people.Have they really been so cruel and bad as shown in moviethey would not let Travis go back, or even worst...After all, it was him who approached the craft, nobodypulled him out of the truck on that day.On opposite, the book is based on real event, and I highlyrecommend reading the book, and forget the movie."
4,good movie,"this is one of the best movies i have seen,and i like true stories movies so this rates high for me..."
3,It's ok,"This movie deals with a man form the country being abducted. The aliens through him on a table, strip him down to his briefs, and perform medicla experiments on him. It is a very creepy movie, but the effects are a little cheap. Try it."
2,Read the Book,"Want to know what really happened? Then read the book, instead. This movie, highly dramatised, severly distorts much of Travis' experiences. It is entertaining, which it was meant to be, but for studying UFOs, get the book."
5,Fire in the Sky,First i would like to say that parts of this film were made here locally in oregon.This film was of it's time a great sci-fi. DB sweeney plays a great roll as the abducty. if you haven't seen this film it's great. I have been looking for this all over and finally found here.
3,you get what you pay for,"it's a cheap book, and it's got cheap information. nothing much to it. i would probably spend a bit more and buy a book that's more in depth with the culture and such of graffiti art. but if you must, like me buy this book to be a part of your growing art book collection, then by all means, no one is stopping you."
5,Best quality ever,I use this dish any time I have company over and I always get compliments. Very beautiful and fine & very best quality. Just love it.
5,Awesome!,"This is the first in the series of Division One stories. Dan & Jamie both agents for Division One have been fighting off a strong attraction for each other for many years. Each engrossed in their own reasons why this match would never work. But tragedy forces them into close quarters and to face their worst fears. At the same time they kind of stand in each others shoes for a short while and suddenly what seemed cut and dry is not really. This story leaves you at the edge of your seat and is hard to put down. You laugh, you cry, and your heart skips a beat as you turn each page. I have not been disappointed. I'm off to read the 2nd book in this series ""Spies, Lies, and Lovers"". If you can get your hands on a copy of this book it's a keeper. Kudos to you Ms. Hayes."
3,I agree with JRK from vermont - Runner's World is better,I first saw Running Times at my podiatrist's office and a few articles are really good but the lay out and the way it is put together is bit unorganized so for me it is not very clear on the subjects that I am reading. Like JRK said I get more out of Runner's World than i did with Running TImes. Since there are not many running magazine out there I think having Running Times is a good additional info if you have the extra dough.
5,excellent magazine for the serious runner,"I have been running and racing for 34 years. This magazine is excellent on knowledge about running and racing. The price on Amazon is the best I have ever seen. I have never paid less than I recently did on Amazom. I also get Runners World, which is a good read, but not so much for the serious runner and racer. I have been reading Running Times for at least 15+ years!"
2,alot of fluff and ads,"So I started training for the ING marathon, its 25 miles and well I'm a big guy, so I'm taking it slow and steady to win the race. No but seriously, with my previously small athletic and medical background, I am following coaches' schedule and training. With all that said, I will be purchasing many items from amazon and for my fellow prime addicts I will be leaving reviews on the products.I found this to be primarily fluff with no real insight. Probably 90% of the running tips I learnt online, or from friends. It is primarily ads, which may help you if you are an avid runner and are looking to see new items available or future ideas."
5,Terrific bottle,"We started out with the regular Playtex drop in bottles but our baby would always seem to end up with to much air in her belly. My husband came home with this bottle one day and I shrugged it off for about a month. I am also breastfeeding and was skeptical if it would work as well. I wish I would have used it earlier! Immediatly I saw results and had a wonderful, gas free baby. Now she keeps down pretty much everything and is able to let off her own effortless tiny burps. The special nipple is a wonderful invention that dosen't let any outside air in. We even have the 8 ounch ones which are just as good. I ghighly recommend these bottles! A+ in my book."
3,Hell's Legionnaire,"This is far flung adventure. Despite the grotesque cover image of the love interest in the story, the woman is actually very attractive and bright. The story is adventure all the way and gives a good idea of what the French foreign legion was all about and how much stress was put on the legionnaires to protect and expand the then French colonial empire."
4,Just what I needed.,The pump came with multiple electrical and plumbing adapters. I guess it can fit numerous applications. It fixed the problem I had with my car. I recommend doing a YouTube search for directions even if you already know how to swap the pump. I had change the pump in this car once before but watching directions reminded me of a few things and probably saved me 10 -20 minutes on the repair job. It took me a little over an hour (96 GMC Suburban).
2,This movie is recorded in extended play,That means it may not be viewable on your vhs player. It wasn't on mine. I tried to manually adjust the tracking many times with no succeess.
4,Really good Book,This book was one of a kind. IT shows the love between best friends and brothers. It is a really good book. I recommend this book to all the young readers who wish to know the meaning of best friends.
5,Faboulas,Love it great wonderful take my word for it must get its a must read great job Mary downing han
4,ON SOME PARTS IT WAS BORING ON SOME LIKE ON THE 2nd CHAPTER,I LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT TALK'S ABOUT BEST FRIEND'S ALSO FAMILY AND PROPER IDEAS I REALY RECOMEND THIS BOOK .
5,My Review,"This is a story about two friends Margret and Elizabeth. They both come from two families and have two brothers at war. They have three enemies, which soon become good friends Gordy, Toad, and Doug. There is suspense when a crazy man is lurking the woods. There is disapointment in the town when a soldier has gone AWOL. But there is romance in the air where you least expect it."
3,Book Review,Overall plot was good but was not developed fully. It did give a good picture of domestic life in the US in World War II.
4,STEPPING ON THE CRACKS,"IT WAS A TOUCHING STORY OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS DURING WW2. IT DEALT WITH THEIR FEELINGS OF THE WAR, HAVING BROTHERS FIGHTING IN THE WAR AND THE THINGS THAT CAN EFFECT PEOPLES LIVES. IT WAS VERY GOOD AND WORTH THE READ."
5,Easy reading nostalgia,I read this book in elementary school and remembered how I loved it then. Now as an adult I purchased the book and read it cover to cover again. This book engulfs you in a nostalgic feeling througout. Can't wait for my 2 year old to be old enough to read it with me.
3,Cross of Iron,"Cross of Iron although it starts out with great action and plot, becomes a bit odd after James Coburn's character suffers shell shock. It has its moments, but over all it seems to be lacking something. It is worth watching, but I was somewhat disappointed after reading its rave reviews."
2,Disappointingly rote.,"A group of German soldiers is trapped in Russian territory in this WWII drama from Sam Peckinpah. No doubt, the battle scenes are mostly excellent (for such a low budget), but the acting is pretty awful (James Coburn's German accent disappears slowly but surely), the sets are cheap and shaky-looking, and there's nothing about it thematically that distinguishes it from any other war film. The worst aspect must be the lack of a resolution, which I hear was due to shortage of money."
2,"A mediocre, not entirely unpleasant experience.","Cross of Iron is noted for being Sam Peckinpah's only war film. As expected, the film is packed to the brim with action (as a matter of fact, it's Peckinpah's most action-packed movie to date), delivering one well-executed battle scene after another until it reaches its ambiguous conclusion. Unfortunately, aside from all the mayhem, the movie offers nothing else.There's really not much of a plot here. The late James Coburn stars as Steiner, a coporal turned sergeant who incurs the wrath of Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell) when he refuses to give Stransky credit for a counterattack he did not organize. This rivalry grows deadly, when Stransky eventually decides to leave Stransky and his men behind Russian territory..."
2,A Strange Film to say the Least.,"This movie is odd. From the opening childer's song to the executions at the end I was confused by this film. There is a large homosexual undertone that really doesn't belong along with some pyschotic scenes that remind of a bad trip. Steiner and his men are forced to fight a battle that Steiner knows Germany is losing with a Major who needs an Iron Cross to make his life complete and a General who is living in the past and waves of Russian troops comming his way. This movie was ok for 1977, but if you really want to see a German squad in Russia watch Stalingrad. (This movie only gets a 2 because its got Germans in it)."
3,Disappointing...,"I made the mistake of reading the novel BEFORE I saw the film. I am not aware of what production problems Sam Peckinpah might have had to face, but he did not do the novel justice. The combat scenes are exciting and gut-wrenching, as are the use of ""authentic"" weaponry by both sides, but Peckinpah lost a great opportunity to portray combat on the Eastern Front as the author intended. Instead, he sold out to Hollywood and pandered to his film audience. Most ridiculous was the end sequence where Coburn's Sgt. Steiner (Steiner in the novel was only 25!)banters with his company commander, Captain Stranssky (Maximillian Schell) as they try to escape a Russian attack. Read the novel for a MUCH better story!"
2,"great story, terrible DVD","An interesting story on an obscure subject, the russian eastern front as the tide was turning against the Germans. Okay, blood and guts do fly and some of the characters over-act their parts, but it was an intersting movie when it was out on film (only a very short release as it wasn't popular movie fare). BUT... and I say again BUT with capital letters, the above was all overshadowed by the terrible job of transfering the film to DVD. My copy jumps scenes, skips, and the sound is terrible. I would have thought it was a fluke, but like a fool bought a second copy at a different store, SAME thing. If the problem would ever be fixed I would buy it again, but not this one."
2,DVD Copy Disappointing of Cross of Iron,"I just purchased this movie. I saw it on the big screen in 1978. I had just finished the book by Willi Heinrich. I was very disappointed. The DVD quality was OK, but there was no widescreen, subtitles or anything beyond the ordinary on it. I had expected a lot more. I really had liked the movie when I saw it in 1978, but now that I've read the book, I didn't even finish watching the DVD. I thought [...] for the disk was way out of line considering what I got. Hen's Tooth pulled a bait-n-switch."
4,The REAL German Wehrmact,"Wow! This movie is amazing.There is no doubt that ""Cross of Iron"" changed the themes and imagery of the War film genre forever after release in 1977.James Coburn as Steiner is one bad [guy]!So this is the type of German soldier that the Allies were really fighting during WWII?! Geez, after watching all the previous ...WWII flicks such as ""To Hell and Back"", I'd almost come to believe that our European enemy in that War was too stupid to win any squad or platoon level firefights against us!If CoI wasn't so heavily edited (with precious footage vanished forever on the cutting room floor), then I would give this movie a 5 star rating.I like this movie so much that I bought a used copy of the novel (long since out-of-print)on ebay.The movie does not closely follow the novel, but it is ground-breaking enough to be considered a classic in its own right."
2,Great movie needs a Director's Cut treatment PRONTO!!!!!!,"5 stars for the film, ZERO for DVD! I find the movie (wich was cut to ribbons!!!by at least 35 minutes)to be simply amazing. Now for the Dvd, I can only add that is the worst DVD in my collection. Bad Audio, Awful tranfer, Horrenduos picture quality, FULL SCREEN (Yuckssss!!!!!) and it's the CUT to shreds version. Where's the director's cut? Why does the Wild Bunch gets the best treatment and not The Iron Cross. One of the most violent war epics before Full Metal Jacket and Private Ryan seems so weak and boring right now!!!...Do not get this edition because you will regret it and don't lsiten to does who have seen only the cut version of the film...someday they will also admire this masterpiece, when some wise distributor release the film in its correct way! Sam peckinpah is the Godfather of modern cinema violence!"
1,how to destroy a great film,"As with most of the other reviews I can say with total honesty that my DVD of Cross of Iron is the worst duplication of any film onto DVD. How can such a second rate company get the rights to one of the greatest war films ever made. Unfortunately for me, living DownUnder, returning this title is not possible finacially. I am thankful I still have a VHS copy."
1,Cross of Iron--DVD---Hens Tooth Video,"Cross of Iron, Sam Peckinpah's last movie has been out of print on vhs for a long time. With a DVD release as poor as this it should have stayed in moratorium until someone who cared could have released a DVD worthy of this great antiwar film. I stilll have a vhs copy that looks better than this dungpile. So whether you are a fan of this movie or Sam Peckinpah do not support this horrible release of such a fine film."
1,Great Movie --Bad DVD,"While I am a big fan of Peckinpah, and feel that this movie was unfairly overlooked for many years, it was almost painful to watch the Hen's Tooth Video DVD version of this film. The interpositive used in the transfer is scratched, pitted, and otherwise in very poor shape for much of the film. The compression rate is terrible, resulting in the worst artifacting I have yet seen on this format, and to top it all off the video does not even preserve the film's aspect ratio.To sum it up: Very compelling movie, which does feel a bit ""dated"" in some of its techniques (but funding was also pulled out from under Peckinpah during production, and this film was made on a very low budget), but the film warrants viewing. It's merely unfortunate that the video distributor did not give the film the respect it deserved. I am returning my DVD copy today, and will wait for someone else to acquire the rights and do the job better."
2,"Good movie, bad DVD",DVD transfer quality is sub-mediocre; looks like a copy imaged from VHS tape. It's also Full Screen. Sound quality is poor.The movie ultimately has merits along the lines that other reviewers have indicated. This is just such a piss-poor release of it.
4,A gripping war film from a new perspective,"If you ask me there can never be enough films or books about the greatest conflict in all of human history. Cross of Iron stands out because it is told from the German perspective, and in terms of realism, suspense, and historical accuracy ranks right up there with the best of the genre, I put it on an equal level with greats like The Longest Day, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Triumph and the Glory. (book, not a movie yet but will be)"
1,The Film is Great but the DVD is absolutely HORRIBLE,"The film is a gritty ""no holds barred"" look at the Russian Front in WWII. I would recommend the VHS version to all WWII movie fans. HOWEVER, the DVD is not widescreen and looks to be dubbed from a worn out copy of the VHS version. I bought this thinking that the DVD would be better quality, but my ancient VHS copy with the original cover art is still better even though there are a few worn spots on it..."
4,War on the Eastern Front,"First of all, it does not do the book justice... but then again, what movie ever does?With that being said, this is a good war movie in its own right. It is intensely graphic and the imagery it is certainly intended to put lie to the idea of war as a noble crusade or a romantic adventure.Cross of Iron revolves around the obsession a German captain has with being awarded the Iron Cross for valor, more as a trophy or vindication for his life as a soldier. One of his soldiers, Steiner, has already earned an Iron Cross, and other decorations, but he too has come to be defined by the war.An excellent film, well worth trying out."
4,"Great movie, DVD version could be better.","This is one of the most powerful World War II movies made, probably because it was based on the fictional (though almost biographical) book of the same name by Willi Heinrich. While the movie is not an exact retelling of the book, it does remain truer to its source than most Hollywood adaptations. I compare ""Cross of Iron"" to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in their similar message and powerful portrayal of war being an extreme assault on the humanity of all involved. I highly recommend the movie itself but don't know that the DVD version is worth the extra as it has no widescreen option and the audio on my copy is pretty low."
2,"really bad digitallization,definitely not from original film","I share with other people with the good quality of the movie. But totally dissapointed by the poor quality of DVD, which is supposed to offer better resolution and contrast than the video tape. This version, by Hen's Tooth Video, seems to be digitallized from a video tape, but of even poorer quality. It is blurry, has ghost shadows(quite visible in the credits part, with characters on screen), and let me suspect that this DVD is digitallized from a video tape that had been in video rental store's circulation for months and the digital signal picked up from a worn out VCR! Such a good movie deserves better. The so called Hen's Tooth Video shouldn't have treated it so carelessly. I am really against any DVD that is not a true digitallization of the original film copy and strongly suggest that information about the reproduction source be available to the customer."
4,For a German view of WW2,"... get this movie. It's not the best war movie, but it's different because it is set on the Eastern Front - which is all but unknown to Americans. Also, it depicts German infantry, weapons and tactics - and that is interesting as well.anyone who is interested in war movies should see it, but anyone who is interested in WW2 must see it."
3,Just an OK war movie,"Cross of Iron was, and is, still just an ok war movie that tried to be different by putting the point of view on sympathetic German, and some Nazi, characters. Peckinpah's done better stuff with The Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs."
1,absolutely terrible,"This without doubt is one of the worst films i have ever seen.Unfortunately the book on which it is based is excellent, the cast in theory should be excellent, and james coburn would seem to be the right man for the job.unfortunately the film is sloppily made and the action scenes would have embaressed the makers of the A team.i actually couldnt even bring myself to watch to the end, maybe better if you havent read the book, as it is a direct but poor translation, and maybe the 70s just wasnt the time to try making it.not worthy of an addition to your DVD collection."
2,"Boring, dull, pointless","Here's a brief synopsis:People with German accents, hiding in a bunker in the woods. Lots of talking. Occasionally, they peek out and these random Hollywood explosions start happening. A few slow motion shots of people dropping dead.I rented this movie expecting a good depiction of some World War II battles. I wanted to see strategy...I wanted to see different battle theatres...instead, I got hundreds of shots of a few guys in the same location with occasional explosions. Boring. The only people I think that truly enjoy this movie either liked it when it first came out or like it just because Sam Peckinpah directed it. Truly forgettable."
3,Breaking New Ground,"Although CROSS OF IRON approaches neither the level of other WWII films (DAS BOOT, STALINGRAD, THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE) nor the overall excellence of other Peckinpah works (RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, THE WILD BUNCH), it remains a valuable film for one main reason: it is one of the few films to deal with the WWII German-Russian front. CROSS OF IRON convincingly portrays the violence and savagery that drove German and Russian soldiers in that theater of the war. For that alone, the film is worth viewing. After experiencing CROSS OF IRON, one can only feel that the German soldiers in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE BIG RED ONE had it easy."
2,CROSSED IRONY,"HaHa ... fun movie with plenty of action. Seen thru the eyes of Germans. The reason I only gave it 2 stars was the ending made no sense to me, otherwise I would have given it more."
1,When will we get a full-length WS Region 1 DVD of this masterpiece?,"I have a Cross of Iron VHS made by ""Media,"" which runs 132 min and which, though full-frame (except for a short sequence in which the Russian boy is killed), is infinitely better than the poorly restored, shorter Hen's Tooth full-frame, DVD. The DVD from Oz is shorter than my VHS by 5 min. A few years ago in London, I saw a Cross of Iron released by UK Warner's, also shorter than my VHS. When will the studio that owns the rights to this masterpiece give us a WS, digitally remastered, Region 1 DVD of this masterpiece? It's about time!"
1,Hen&#65533;s Tooth Video should be ashamed,"Totally agree with Newton Munnow's comments. This DVD is an abortion, shoddily transferred, poorly and cheaply packaged and to top it all off it's PAN AND SCAN. Hear that sound, that's Sam Peckinpah spinning in his grave. I have DVDs I paid $5 list price that are superior to this piece of garbage. The sad thing is that Hen's Tooth are releasing one of my fave movies, Vincent Ward's The Navigator next February, but on the basis of the assassination job they did on Cross of Iron, I will not be purchasing it. Please nobody buy this awful DVD. Wait and catch the movie on TV or hold on to your VHS copy because this thing aint worth $1."
3,I liked it in 1977 - not so much today,"I saw ""Cross of Iron"" when it was in theatrical release in 1977 and thought it was a pretty good treatment of the German side of WWII.I watched it again last night on DVD and found myself fast-forwarding past the dull spots. Since I have collected WWII German militaria, lots of little mistakes in uniforms and equipment jumped out at me. The most glaring was the imitation Reich war flag hanging in the background in the outdoor hospital scenes.Coburn's performance holds up, but Schell's character is so broadly drawn as to seem malevolently cartoonish. And then there's Peckinpah's cliche treatment of violence by reverting to slow-motion when the shooting and stabbing start. It served him much better in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.""The art of the war film has matured considerably since 1977 and compared with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" ""Cross of Iron"" comes across today as a heavy-handed Hollywood production."
3,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST BUT STILL WORTH A VIEW,"The rest of the reviews on this movie sum it up - you have a director who was spinning downward into addiction while attempting to make an epic war movie. Most likely it is only through the sheer talent of the director, the people around him, and the actors in the movie that this movie is watchable.You have some strange choices in where the story goes and how it gets there - it lurches from the examination of homosexuality in the military, the horrors of war and the mental health of the survivors of war, into guys on patrol / trying to get home story. The action scenes, as with almost any Peckinpah movie, are exciting and horrifying. A ""Ballet of Violence"" as John Woo would say. The acting and dialogue is all over the place- but Coburn and Schell love to chew the scenary and do it soooo well. You get Coburn with guns in a war and slow motion Peckinpah violence with an anti-war message to boot = not a bad way to spend a few hours = 3 1/2 stars"
3,"Its ok. A little too long and tedious, great battle sequences","This one was sugested by a friend and fellow scale modeler, and well i would have to say is good but similar to many other war movies of the time, the acting is good, the uniform and equipment basically correct, except for the american halftrack and grayhoun armored car in the background. What really shines are the battle sequences, i believe at least 10 extras and stunt men have had to die in this one, incredible explosions and a very good control of the action. Also the part with the russian t-34/85 tanks was fantastic. On movie to watch at least once."
2,A Tragic Ripoff,Leave it to the Japanese to do a better job in the DVD release of this epic WW2 film. It deserves much better than the poor VHS quality pan and scan vserion of this DVD by Hens Tooth. Both the Japanese release and the European release from Warner Brothers treat this film with the respect it deserves with a widescreen 1.85 crystal clear(at least compared to this job) picture and sound.Try renting the video and save your money for a future release in the way this film deserves to be done.
1,Superb war movie-unacceptable transfer,"One of the great war movies of all time. Transfer is hideous. Needs Criterion type treatment.Best transfer is out of print Jap. Laser Disc. Henstooth transfer washed out, grainy, poorly cropped, poor audio. Hensteeth is for the birds. AVOID THIS OR ANY BY SAME company."
5,"War, Death and Men","This is a wonderful film, I saw it when I was in my teens and it left a lasting impression on me, especially the wonderful performance by Coburn who was a fabulous actor. He is invaluable in this role and his face and presentation embodies Steiner completely. Steiner is the existentialist anti-hero, anti-authority and bearing the marks of a cynic, he nonetheless cares about the fate of his men in a war that is absurd. From stupid and vain superior officers, to petty infighting amongst one's own ranks, this film embodies war not as something heroic, but as something solitary and individual. . . . ."
4,Another funny touching love story,"Barbara Daly proves once again why she is a RITA-winner with this funny, touching love story of mistaken idenity. Normally, I avoid the theme books in category romance but I'm glad I didn't with this one. Having lived through last year's blackout here in New York, I couldn't wait to read Barbara Daly's take on it, having enjoyed her previous books, Mistletoe over Manhattan, and a Long Hot Christmas. This one was just as charming. Her hero was to die for, and her heroine Blythe sweet and charming. I look forward to reading more books by Barbara Daly."
1,Overwhelmed by smoke,What may be fine tea underneath is totally overpowered by throat burning smoke. I am unable to taste anything but smoke. I'll take my smoke in a cigar thank you.
5,Your mileage may vary.,"I love this tea and this is the best version of it I've come across. Very rich and smokey.My friend calls it ""lapssng SoWrong,"" so I guess you should try it before buying the six pack."
5,One of my favorite tea flavors,"This is one of the teas that I enjoy on a weekly basis and I normally buy the Twining brand, so when they offered this at a discount, I jumped at the chance; Thanks Amazon!"
1,aroma of shoe outlets in Maine.,If you like sucking on shoe leather you will love this tea. I have a wide variety of teas that I enjoy (about 30 in the pantry right now) and this was the first time I was unable to finish the cup. The smell reminds me of family trips to the Bass shoe outlets in Maine. The box is pretty. I paid $2.35 at the international food market in Dallas. DOn't know why it is so expensive here. Maybe the illusion of value based upon price?
3,Photo reproductions mediocre,What a shame that this comprehensive study is not adequately illustrated. A meager assortment of badly-copied black&white reproductions. What a spectacular item it would be if there were SOME repro's in full COLOR...
3,Not what I wanted,"I was looking for the European version includes 22 tracks, information that is available for purchase is wrong, in the tracklist appears as disc 1 and disc 2 should be noted that 2 is a DVD! is my mistake but the information should be better!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is a great concert DVD. I know that WT has an orchestra in all their CD's, but still this is an awesome DVD. The 5.1 Dolby sound just enhances the experience. If you like Within Temptation or any other kind of symphonic metal, then this is a perfect DVD for you."
3,The music is AMAZING! The camera angles in the DVD are NOT!,"The Black Symphony concert stage is stunning and the band and orchistra sound unbelievable! However, the fast changing camera angles made the the concert almost unviewable, butchering the entire performance! There is not enough time for your eyes to adjust to what your seeing and you hardly ever get a good view of the entire stage to see all of the band at once or their backdrop screen. I read another reviewer complaining about this but had no idea it could be so bad it would be worth avoiding. It's really too bad because there is way more music on the dvd then there is on the cd, but to avoid a migrane I'll probably never watch the dvd again :("
5,"Don't hesitate, just buy it.","I won't go into a long spiel about how awesome and epic this DVD is; others have done that sufficiently. If you like WT just buy it, you will not be disappointed."
3,Three stars for the camera five for the music.,When bands make Live DVD's the worst thing the film crew can do is have one jump cut after another. This happened with the last Nightwish DVD and it's happened with WT now. The music is great but the fast jump cuts make it hard to watch. Part of seeing a live DVD is also being able to see the lighting effects they used for the show. A good example of a well filmed live show is Kamelot's One Cold Winter's Night the film crew did not go for the jump cuts and would show you the members and the lighting and ever thing else.I think WT was a little cheated with the film crew and they could have done a better job filming it for the band and Orchestra after all it's not ever day you get to see a metal band and any Orchestra play together.
5,Excellent concert!!!,"Got the DVD, and have to say...what an awesome concert!!! Enjoyed every second of thier performance and have to say, the only thing better would be if they release the Blu-Ray of this concert for sale in the US. Watched it three times straight through in the first two days I had it. Excellent choice for any WT fan!!"
5,WT Black symphony,What can I say but Excellant!! Since I found this group I remain amazed at their music and performances. Love it!!!
4,Lo,"One of the most unknown groups here in the USA, Within Tempation really rock!! Coupled with a huge orchestra gives this a huge presence.,"
2,Great music - awful sound quality!!!!!!!!!!,"What a shame this release was so poorly recorded. Like the other reviewers, I can't muster the energy to listen to this entire recording at one sitting. Sorry Jimmy"
1,God awful,"Boring, uninspired. I couldn't even get through it. Sorry all you Jimmy Cliff lovers. I like his other stuff but this one sucked!!! BIG TIME"
3,Great product bad experience,"I bought two rods, one casting one spinning. The first time they arrived they were damaged because of bad packaging. Sent back. Items were sent again. Wrong items. I ordered Medium Action, rods are medium light action. Returned these. Items were received again and still the wrong items. i sold them to a friend and went and bought the rods I wanted locally. Just got tired of going to the UPS store.I have never experienced anything even close to this from Amazon. I hope it's the last."
3,"Missleading title, but good none the less","I'm sure that as a simple research tool for Victorian historians, this is a wonderful source of first hand accounts. The title however, making it sound like fashion (i.e. costume history) is somehow a large part of the story. It is not. If you're buying this book for costume research or fashion history, don't. It's not that kind of book. Except for the title problems, the work is fine in itself. It was a diary, so we can't exactly criticize the author for writing skills=). Be forewarned, if a lot of religious language irritates or bores you, you'll find it hard to get through this one. Virtually every entry begins with things like, ""The lord has blessed me and my house with...."" etc."
1,Wired so Very Tired,"I'm amazed that this sententious, gaudy zine still exists. The challenge is to distinguish between content and advertising. Rather than Marshall McLuhan as their patron saint, they should have chosen Calvin Klein."
5,Not ordering this great mag from Amazon,"I am canceling the order I put in today for this great mag. I am joining the boycott of Amazon. They have chosen to sell a Kindle book called ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure."" I cancelled my entire order and am switching to Borders."
2,Under 30? Maybe for you.,"I got my subscription free with an Amazon purchase, but this magazine was a waste on me. If you are under thirty and enjoy getting emails without capitalization and punctuation, this is your magazine. If you pay $30 for a t-shirt that looks 30 yrs old and you paid extra for the tears in your $60+ jeans then you might like this magazine. Now if you remember Abercrombie & Fitch when it was the high end Eddie Bauer or LL Bean, then this might not be your type of magazine...very busy with no real substance."
1,Wired,I tried to return this (it was a gift but I then found out that the recipient was already receiving it). Got the run-around from both Amazon and Conde Nast (the publisher). I can't seem to get it canceled nor can I get a refund (I've now called both at least twice). Horrible.
2,"Good magazine, just wish it would come!","I ordered this almost a month ago and still have not received my first issue. While this is a great magazine for people that are interested in technology, computers, etc, I cannot give it the 5 stars it deserves because I don't yet have the magazine!"
4,Still my favorite magazine.,"The only thing I would really like Wired to improve is their access to the digital version. I've been a happy subscriber for years, which means I can access the digital version as well as the print that is delivered to my house. Problem is, I don't own an iPad or a Nook; since I have a Nexus 7 I appear to be out of luck. This just doesn't seem right and I hope they resolve it very soon."
2,So many insert ads that they have to send it in a bag,"I subscribed to Wired to give it a shot as it was on sale for $10/year at the time. I wouldn't and won't subscribe again. There are some interesting articles here and there, but they are really geared to those who live, dream, and eat tech. I cannot stand getting each issue now. You open the bag and 4-5 advertisements fall on your lap right away. Then it's a non stop hassle when you try going through the pages. They are everywhere."
4,Where would I be without Wired?,"I should start out by saying that I am a hardcore ""nerd"" but mask it in my daily life as I'm now a father, business owner, etc.Wired is one of those ""mainsteam"" nerdy magazines that seems to satisfy my monthly lust for technology, new ideas, and inside information into businesses that I've always wondered ""how did they do that?""I like the magazine because it doesn't try to be something it isn't....it's just consistently good information that keeps me reading month after month."
5,great magazine for active minds,"You can't really pinpoint Wired, since it covers a wide range of topics. Its mostly geared toward people interested in science and technology, but it doesn't stay boxed in that all the time. You'll find odd articles once in a while such as on gardening or sex. Its by far one of the better made magazine out there.One odd article i found recently: How to escape a zombie mob (and they give you specific directions on how to run)"
4,A good way to stay wired to what's new in the world of tech,"I've been reading this magazine for years on and off but didn't subscribe until now because Amazon was offering a discount with some other purchase that I made. I've always liked the magazine, but it seems that lately it has become less techie and more into other subjects and some of the ""fluff"" articles that seem more commercial than a lot of the ""hack into it yourself"" articles of the past. Nonetheless, I still enjoy it although I don't read it cover to cover like I used to.It's a good magazine for finding out about the newest devices and has certainly been a factor in influencing my shopping over the years. There is always something that I can't wait to buy that I didn't even realize existed. It also contains a lot of good information and often answers questions about problems with computers or other electronics.It's a fun magazine and I'd recommend for anyone who has an interest in computers, electronics and new technology."
3,"Entertaining, but techie fluff","I *DO* enjoy reading Wired's articles that cover topics outside of my expertise.... but I found that articles written about topics within my expertise are poorly researched, poorly written, and distortions of the ""latest and greatest"" science fad. It seems as if Wired authors use Wikipedia as their primary source. Needless to say, I lost faith in what I had been reading and enjoying and I'm seeking information elsewhere. But what really turned me off was the snarky ""Letters to the Editor"" section, where the editors will rebut any comment that their articles are overblown fluff. Read it online -- it's not worth any of your money."
5,The survivor!,If you are interested in the digital world this is a good magazine to read. It is good and informativ and is interesting to many levels of technology experts. A few years ago there were a lot of magazines in this category and most failed. There is a reason this is one of a very few who survived!
1,"Vacuous, But Oh So Glossy!","The allure of Wired is entirely beyond me. My problem with Wired is that it is devoid of content. In any given issue, the sum information that it provides could neatly be spread onto a low-tech 3x5 index card. Despite its pretense, Wired offers all of the stimulating substance of an issue of Tiger Beat or an episode of Mamma's Family. The magazine is far more concerned with glossy advertisements and mini-features that barely run over 200 words. If you actually want articles that delve into a subject with an expertise that is accessible without being alienating, then do not subscribe to this magazine. All in all, Wired seems to provide nothing more than a means for techno-yuppies to shop for new gadgets, and in that respect it actually does a fantastic job of mirroring the Web itself."
1,"Horrible! Not Wired, More like Science Magazine.","I ordered this magazine for myself because I am in web design and wanted to stay up-to-date with technology. The description of the magazine sounded like it fit this bill, plus had rave reviews. I am three issues in and could not be more disappointed! I want to cancel this magazine!There is very little in this magazine that has to do with technology of any kind. It is filled with ads, and any actually material seems to be more like science than technology. I mean, how they give elephants vasectomy?! What the heck does this have to do with being ""wired"" or technology. This is science.I have also found that the topics on the cover are either not in the magazine or they are a tiny blurb and not a article.This magazine is really bad. It has very bad content that has nothing to do with technology, or what you would expect in a magazine titled, ""Wired"". I will not be renewing this subscription!"
1,"Wired is good, but this subscription provider is NOT!","I had already been receiving Wired. When I received an email from Amazon telling me to renew my subscription, I thought $10 is reasonable and worth it for this magazine. I clicked on the link and went ahead to renew. About three days later, I received an official renewal in the mail from Wired for $8! I can't feel but a little bit swindled. Surely the convenience of renewing online is not worth $2 since it is just as simple to write a check and drop it in the mail.Overall, Wired is great, but I'd recommend shopping around first if you are renewing. I will definitely be a little bit more patient next year."
2,Written for Men,"Some of the articles were interesting/clever, but overall this magazine is aimed too strongly (in my opinion) toward men. As a 20 something female ordering this subscription to get interesting tech information and stay up on the latest/greatest tech news, this magazine fell short. I found many of the articles crude and even tasteless. Maybe the obvious target market of men (probably ages 22 to 35) would enjoy this magazine, but it definitely wasn't for me."
2,Nothing but Ads,"I have been reading Wired for several years and it has always been a good read with interesting articles and neat little tid bit pieces. However, the last few issues have been filled with advertisements. It got to the point with the latest isse that I ended up halfway through and quit reading the magazine and just started counting the ads. There was an advertisement on every other page. Sadly it is time to let this subscription lapse and move on to something that puts more effort into filling the pages with content."
3,Techno-Fetishism Monthly,"Wired's typography and information design have always fairly screamed ""We Are Cool And You Are Not"", as an in-crowd come-on to geeks who always hungered to be thought of as kewl. It's very best writing reaches the level of Entertainment Weekly, but it's primarily a shill-rag for memes that profit power-players, replete with power-worship and techo-fetishism. For better or worse, though, it's must reading if you want to understand where the ""thought leaders"" are headed -- in much the same way that EW or People Magazine is must reading for people who want to understand where popular culture is headed."
2,Canceled,"Too many meaningless articles about internet fluff. Meant to make you feel like you are ""in"" the crowd.Technical errors abound.Hardware reviews are constantly for things only the 1% can afford or would want.Insulting, dumb, useless writing much too often.Occasional interesting article, so two stars, but not worth the subscription."
1,I never received it.,I haven't received any of the copies and I don't know of any contact person or company to complain about this problem. Bogus!
3,Only $5.00 now? - I paid $7.00 and feel like I over paid,"When I subscribed I was hoping for a bit more meat but what you get is mainly fat. For starters the mag is apx 90% ad space, with the rest being fluff - ""how to be web poser"" or an in depth look at Starbucks coffee machines, a few short product reviews and personality profile articles on various people in tech/web/comp biz. There have been a few things of merit, a feature on Shai Agassi who is developing an electric car, one about who the next President should listen to, a feature on ""Weird"" Al Yankovic that was interesting. But so far I would consider only 50 of a 1000 + pages have been worth reading."
5,"An excellent read, look forward to it arriving each month",This a quite a magazine. Great for those of us with mild A.D.D. and need a fast paced interesting read. I have given it as gift to several friends and they all enjoy it.
3,"Good content, but too LOUD!","This mag does a fine job at covering the latest in technology and culture. However, the flashy graphics and overabundance of advertisements make it so difficult to read!Thanks, WIRED, for assuming your readers have no attention span."
1,Don't purchase here,"Good magazine, but if you are an international subscriber, don't purchase here. I am still waiting for my 1st issue (I took advantage of the $10/year offer in January 2011). I indicated to Amazon.com and to Wired that I haven't received the first issue which was to be delivered by March, and got a reply from Wired that my subscription is only for 2 issues. Needless to say, I am trying to cancel the subscription and want a refund."
4,Variety of articles was fascinating!,"This is the first issue of Wired I've read. Couldn't believe the variety of articles: 1)Why companies are ""selling"" product for free;2)Autism from the inside view; 3)The re-floating of a capsized cargo ship..carrying over 4,000 Mazdas by a salvage company..and so on. Had to read it cover to cover..am now a subscriber."
1,Why bother?,The subscription was included in another purchase. I've seen the mag before and found it to be pretty useless as far as conveying hard information. Most of what I've read from the articles can be found in the product's press release.
4,Wired Rips,"Since receiving Wired the past three years, it has been one of the most relished magazine that I wait upon to see - what's new, any tamely or wild electronics, and a decent broad tech. read for flipping or re-reading for an academic paper. I consider Wired, a start for introducing readers to the vast world of technology in ""layman/woman terms."" Overly, a clever and decent read to carry during a commute. Enjoy!"
3,"Fading, but still interesting","It wasn't long ago, at the peak of the tech stock bubble, that Wired was an immensely thick, immensely brash young magazine that documented the new emerging world. Startling graphics alternated with stories prophetizing the coming of a new world- sort of a ""Matrix"" with on-line grocery delivery and bio-implants.Well, the dot-com bubble burst, Wired shrunk to half or a quarter of its previous size, and what looked like prophesy now reads more like a Popular Mechanics for GenY. But it's still attractive, it's still cheap, and it's still fun to read. I'm keeping my subscription."
5,Wired,"I purchased this magazine for my son ( a 14 yr old science mind). He loves it! He educates me after reading each issue. It is difficult to find magazines to enhance or go beyond classroom instruction. When this one arrives, we do not see him for hours. I bought Wired for him a year ago and will happily keep renewing his subscription.It would make a great gift.It is now April 13, 2008; this magazine is still going strong in our house. I still highly recommend this magazine.It is now March 24, 2009; several years have passed and we still are still enjoying this magazine!"
1,Great Magazine but Horrible Subscription,"I have subscribed to the Wired 4 months ago, first issue they were supposed to send me didn't arrive and it turns out that they have a wrong adress (I don't know how they did manage to take a totally different adress from my amazon account). They have corrected the adress but I didn't receive the second issue. When I tell them about this and ask them to send me the issue they advise me to wait for another month and hope that I receive this time. Cheap price comes with cheap service."
1,"May have started out as a Tech Magazine, now more of a general gossip magazine.","I had heard about Wired for quite some time but never bothered reading it. Then I saw a 1-year sub here for $10. Boy have I regretted spending that $10 on this rag. Not much in it is Techy anymore. Most of it seems to be just gossipy trash promoting wacko psuedo science and thinly veiled political viewpoints. I just throw them away now without bothering to even crack them open. Also almost every other page is a full page ad and what pages aren't full page ads have quarter to half sized page ads. No wonder this thing is $10 for a year, it's not even worth that."
1,Not for homes with young children,"Even thought many of the articles are interesting and well written, I will never renew this subscription. This magazine came to my home with a very vulgar ad for GQ shrink wrapped with the magazine. The picture was blatantly displayed full page on the back of the Wired magazine. I have young children at home and having a magazine delivered to my mailbox with a completely naked woman (and I mean completely) positioned to hide the bare minimum isn't acceptable. I thought I was getting a reputable publication, not this trash. Be aware of this fact before you order a subscription that they include these types of ads with your subscription."
2,Needs ReWired,"To be honest, I do pick up this Mag from the Newstand 4 to 5 times a year, but I can hardly call myself a fan. If you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag, Wired is not for you, It tries too hard to be hip and trendy, but it's group of Left/Lib Nerds too often come off as being lame and borish. Wired needs to be ""ReWired"" to meet the needs of the modern tech community."
1,Disappointed in you . .,I only read one issue and tried to cancel because my interest were not met. I had to jump through hoops to comlete the cancelation task. Succeeded at last. Still don't know if the refund got into the correct account.
1,"Please, few weeks I sed I dont want to renew the subscription to Wired magazine!!","Please, few weeks I sed I dont want to renew the subscription to Wired magazine!!"
1,Wired subscription from Amazon,"Hard to review a product you haven't received yet. So . . . I know Wired is an awesome magazine, but the subscription service from Amazon hasn't delivered over a month later.Not so good on customer service. Price is great, but no product = no satisfaction after a month. You better be real patient to feel good about this sale!"
2,Typical Magazine,"Like any magazine, there are always ideas that can be gleamed. There are not too many in this one.It has been a while since I subscribed to Wired.Either I have changed a lot or the magazine has a lot of its unique content.The latest issue (third for me) is waiting in a stack to be read instead of on the top of the stack."
4,"technology, technology, technology","I first got this magazine because i am really into computers, but after a few issues i was amazed with the deep articles about all different types of technology. All the articles are deeply thought and very well researched and they hit the topics form all different angles giving you the entire scoop on what it means to you the consumer and how it could or will affect your life.If you enjoy technology or are interested in all different forms of technology this is a ""must read"" magazine"
4,My college-age son loves this magazine,"My college-age son, who loves both science and politics, is a voracious reader of magazines like The Economist and National Geographic, but THIS (Wired) is his favorite magazine. He says it keeps him current on the latest in technology innovations and does so not in tech-speak but in plain-language.I like it because you can frequently get a year's subscription for $10-12 and sometimes even less. Clearly, it's all about being able to tell advertisers that you have a sizeable subscription base. Works for me if it keeps the price down!"
5,Wonderful feature articles,"I love reading Wired magazine because of the quality in the articles it publishes. Just recently there was an article written where the author attempted to disappear and remain missing for 30 days without being found. Although he was close, the author was ultimately discovered close to the end of 30 days through some sophisticated techniques used by a team of readers. Which reveals the difficulty of remaining anonymous and disconnected from the world in this day and age.For those interested in gadgets, and technology, I recommended subscription to Wired, as it provides an interesting reach every month with its in-depth feature articles."
3,A bit one track,"This magazine has some interesting material but because it aims to be based in the state of the art science, some of the content is pretty extreme. So order it and expect to be able to get thorugh some of the articles but not all, unless you yourself are a scientist or Techie."
2,"Arrived late, then disappointment with content","To me, this seems a little ladish. I was looking for something that was based on technology. This was not, instead going on about start up companies and other rubbish. Have revcieved 2 copies so far and I can not say that I enjoyed a full story in either of them. Have 10 more copies to go, so maybe there will still be a couple of rabbits in the hat, but really do not think I will be re-ordering this drivil."
3,Kindle Please!,"I absolutely love this magazine, but I would enjoy it even more if I could read it on my Kindle. I recommend it to anyone who likes science, technology, or the person who wants to understand more about those topics."
1,Never received the product.,"I ordered a subscription and 3 months later, I still have not received a copy yet."
1,never arrived,"Although I love Wired magazine, I have yet to receive any of my subscription through Amazon in the mail."
2,Kinda dry....,"I recieved this subscription free with another purchase. I love tech but find this magazine takes a bit of a clinical approach. I might reccomend this magazine in the way I would a text book, It informs you but doesn't really make the subject matter interesting. It's a decent read in a doctor's office, But not on the home coffee table."
3,Need patience...,"I ordered it on 9/4/08, it's been almost 6 weeks now, I still haven't gotten my first issue of the magazine. So... if you are ordering it as a present for someone, order EARLY!! Hopefully it'll be here soon :("
4,Good stuff,"Wired Magazine is a very interesting and useful magazine, and at this price its even better. Its nice to know I'll always have a good, large magazine to read for bus and subway trips."
4,Passes the time. Good magazine with some flaws,"I didn't subscribe off Amazon, but even subscribing from the mags website has proven to be hit or miss. I usually receive it a few days after it hits the shelves. But there are off months when it arrives substantially late. The interior of the magazine is indeed spammed with ads (usually one per two pages until the main articles) I love the somewhat random content Wired provides though. Articles are interesting and the writers throw in some humor. Although most people's first impression is that wired is a purely tech magazine, do not let the name fool you. As I said the magazine has many a random article, especially in the start section of each issue. Definitely not for everyone, but then again that is why there are plenty of other magazines to flip through. If you like a little randomness though, flipping through wired is a good choice."
4,Informative and downright hilarious at times,"Leading edge technology news and analysis. Irreverent and snarky writing style can be seriously funny. I usually laugh out loud at least once per issue as I read it. Editorial slant is assertively post-modern and almost anti-religious at times. Learn, laugh, and sometimes bristle as you spend time upgrading your tech and pop-tech knowledge."
2,"Bulky, eye-catching ads, but not much content","Wired always seems to have a pulse on what's happening in the ""New Economy"". However, I found most of the articles to be long-winded and not too insightful. The magazine has a hip image, great cutting edge ads, but I'd prefer Red Herring anyday. It seems like a lot to pay for a magazine that has so many ads."
1,a tremendous disappointment,"this magazine has much going for it but almost, without fail, falls far short. The articles, mostly, have the merits to be decent read and something you can find informative, unfortunately --either the editors edit out the content or the writers only write fluff-- the articles are filled with nothing of substance. For instance, in an article several years ago about the need to move to nuclear power, the author tries to disprove all other forms of power in one 6 sentence paragraph. Now if that isn't fair reporting, then I guess I don't know what an argument is. Afterwards, as most articles in Wired, it starts fluffing out instead of actually reporting anything.In short, the reviews only look at the neatest features and not the price or quality (ie the review is nothing more than you can find by 5 minutes at Best Buy). The articles suck, give you nothing, and make you a little bit more ignorant of subject matters."
5,Always read Wired,"Wired is not a magazine, it's an institution. They have their fingers on the pulse of all things new, and do a great job at finding the irony and humor in where we are going as a culture. Also makes a great gift."
2,Needle in a Haystack,"After reading many interesting articles on the Wired website, I figured I'd try the magazine since it is cheap. I won't be renewing that subscription.There ARE some genuinely interesting, informative, etc articles in the magazine. Unfortunately there are only a few such articles and you'll have to wade through myriad ads, fluff, and pretentious rants to find them.Better off reading only the interesting articles online for free."
4,Classy but ad-filled,"I'm a long-time reader and new subscriber, and Wired doesn't seem to pack the punch it did the last few years. The multi-page advertising sections are creeping into Wired's otherwise excellent first-half sections. It seems the ad creep of the net has taken its toll on pulp as well.That said, this puppy's solid enough to guide the casual tech investor and enthusiast, when balanced with more staid journals.A quick flip through a newsstand copy will yield a card for Wired's... subscription."
1,Never got it,They never sent it to me .... still havn't seen an issue.so I'd so my review is not so goodT Arnold
1,wow,"Holy crap does this mag suck. I got it for free, and I no longer even open it. It goes straight to the recycling bin. Wow... it is bad. Just read the reviews. I am not going to bother repeating what others have already said. I just wanted to contribute to the lowering of the stars."
5,GREAT MAG,"Wired is the most enjoyable magazine I have read in years!Great articles, on a large range of subjects, lots of tech product reviews!"
4,wired mag review,"Just got my first issue and it seems to be a good read....good humor, good stories, look forward to my next one.."
4,Great all-around magazine!,"I started reading WIRED from my school's library. This year I am a different school, so I bought a 1 yr subscription. This magazine is perfect for the discriminating readers who want a little bit of everything. Science is a main part, but is subtlety hidden. Plus you won't feel embarrassed when your friends walk in, like other magazines such as People. Great for guys."
2,Just Plain Boring,"As a self confessed geeky type I was really looking forward to my first issue. Maybe my excitement had built too much during the 3 months it took for the damn thing to arrive, but the first issue was quite disappointing. Give it another chance I thought - second issue arrived today and I have pretty much the same opinion.So what's the problem - IMHO the magazine has an identity crisis. It tries to be a lot of things (new technology reporter, product reviewer, political commentator) but doesn't quite cut it in any of these categories. As a result it becomes a rather disjointed read. In the end you get bored quickly."
3,"Not bad but used to be better, and as with any tech magazine, is outdated as soon as you get it...","I used to subscribe to WIRED magazine roughly ten years ago, but stopped when the content became more gloss and less substance.With that said, for casual nerdy readers, WIRED is a great magazine. The articles are usually very interesting and it always offers new information that wouldn't necessarily be readily available elsewhere.The biggest problem is that technology these days evolves so rapidly that, like financial publications that purport to give advice about stock trading, as soon as the material has been published it is already outdated.If you are interested in WIRED magazine, I would recommend instead adding the WIRED website (or Slashdot DOT org) to your internet browser's bookmark list and just checking that daily -- the content is always updated quickly and will be more relevant.... and it's free."
2,Wired Magazine,"Mag is not very good. Apparently, this was an auto renew but I wasn't notified...not very professional. If I was notified I would not have renewed. I guess that's why they don't notify you...."
2,Whiney nerds are annoying...,"First off, I'm a huge geek. I love programming and computers and the internet. You'd think Wired would be like some great magazine for me. But the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this ""bad"" stuff in the world, it makes you sick. For every cool article about Japanese robots, you have to wade through like 10 articles about ""how America is doomed"". Whatever... they need to man up."
1,No app for Android,"Wired magazine itself is an amazing work. I've learned more from wired than I thought possible.I love the in depth reporting of topics other publications wouldn't think to publish. Wired creates wonderful pieces that inspire me to learn more about new topics. Recently I've enjoyed articles about a/b testing, modular skyscrapers, and the history of nerf guns!I gave this review 1 star because there is no android app despite the demand. Wired readers are tech savy, why isn't Conde Nast?I've written several emails to the subscription department only to receive a form letter with no timeline or plan for an android app.To add insult to injury, Wired sends emails every few months to remind me that I can view the recent edition on ipad, kindle fire, and nook."
1,WIRED Magazine subscription,"Cannot review this Amazon purchase because the subscription takes 4 to 6 weeks to process, i.e. 4 to 6 weeks before my first magazine shows up. Why does it take 4 to 6 weeks to process a magazine subscription?"
1,How much Apple fanboy-ism can a person take?,I bought a year subscription to check it out. It seemed that most of the tech articles were nothing but over the top Apple fanboy-ism. Everything seems to have a slant- they can't just report a story. There are so many interesting topics in the area they cover it is hard to see how they consistently bungle it- but they do!
3,Strange!,"I got this as a freebie when I boughtanother product. It's a very strangemagazine. I doubt that I'll subscribeafter my free year is over, but pickup a copy and judge for yourself."
1,More than half ads,"When I received my first issue, I was impressed at just how large the magazine was. At some 230 page long, it dwarfs every other magazine I receive.But when I actually sat down to read the thing, I realized it was a total waste of money. I've never seen a magazine with this many advertisements. More than half the pages are ads. The few articles there are have so little meat to them, it's not worth the effort of flipping through all the ads. I'm very disappointed."
2,Very naive writers but occasionally has an excellent article.,"I have to say that I get my copy of Wired for free. It is simply not worth subscribing to.Why? The writers either fawn excessively over some product or person or they are so naive that they believe anything a celebrity/writer/etc tells them. You could sell them just about any story as real even if it was about aliens in Roswell. I have never encountered a magazine that continually passes off truths based on total hearsay. Ex; the story about Facebook and the movie was ludicrous to say the least.On the other hand, Wired usually have at least one interesting article in each magazine. As such if you can get a subscription cheap enough, it might be worth it."
3,at least the ads aren't over my head,"I'm sure this is more for the tech minded; but, there's still enough in it for the rest of us. If you have time and enjoy spending it thumbing thru magazines, this one is certainly entertaining. The ads are sleek, the men are handsome and there's tidbits of info for everyone."
3,A confusing magazine; not what it used to be,"I used to subscribe to this magazine back in the internet heyday around the turn of the millennium. It was great, really different but more important, really RELEVANT. I saw this great offer for $1/issue and figured what the heck I'll try it again. This magazine is nowhere near what it used to be, and it's just chock full of glossy, irrelevant ads. They even include other magazine clips and advertising inserts inside the plastic wrap it comes with. It reminds me of my wife's Glamour magazine now.Yes, some of the articles are still trendy and forward looking from a technology standpoint, and it's a great value at $1/issue, which is why I'm still rating it 3 stars, but it's so all over the place in terms of content now as to be confusing. It has lost its identity. I am not going to renew it."
2,too much advertistements,The issue (first one) I got was completely filled with advertisements you had to literally hunt for content.
2,skin deep,"too many ads, not one single finished product.what is the point of this magazine? aw yeah, i've heard aboutthe global warming but don't ask me what where why is happening type ofno-information?no, thank you, it is a waste of time, and lots of trees..."
1,"Received only one, good magazine, poooooooor service","i loved this magazine, i used to love it more before my subscription, received my first issue, then i stopped received any. I claimed at the web page of the magazine, and still today they never responded. Very disapointed. Stopped reading it because i won't pay twice for any magazine."
5,One of the best harpsichord recordings ever made,"A great performance by Kenneth Gilbert on a 1716 French harpsichord (Donzelague, Lyon) of the Airs and Dances from Rameau's opera 'Les Indes Galantes' transcribed by Jean-Philippe Rameau himself. The sonics of this disc are extra special too. It is a 1979 analog (probably all vacuum tube as well) recording made by the great recording engineer Jean-Francois Pontefract for Harmonia Mundi France and was originally released as a vinyl LP. The digital master for the CD was done by Sanyo, Japan from the original analog master tape. Quite frankly, most Super Audio Compact Discs (SACDs) of solo harpsichord music do not sound anywhere near this good. Highly recommended and worth seeking out; this CD was re-issued by Harmonia Mundi and may be easier to find in the re-issue release."
4,Just-In-Time Teaching,I received a great copy of this book through an Amazon vendor at an excellent price. This book is the pioneering work in delivering customized lessons through preliminary web interaction with students. I learned about the book in a recent STEM conference. These techniques can be applied to any subject.
2,Days of (Turkey) Thunder,"Comment: Oh boy... everytime I watch this movie, it seems that I have forgot that this movie is the poster child for having the worst mismatched sound track of all time. Either `The Flashdance Orchestra"" was in the right place at the right time or they offered to do the soundtrack for free. At least a half a dozen times or more I expected Tom Cruise to break out in a Flashdance routine wearing his Winston Cup leg warmers. Both Randy Quaid and Academy Award winner Robert Duvall couldn't pull this ""Red Herring"" off. And what about Nicole Kidman's accent... especially when she keeps saying, ""let me out of the caaayyur... what the... If anyone has even an inkling of how ""car racing"" works it will be hard for them to not throw up as they watch this car racing.. ah... movie. They must have hired the Flashdance writers also... (two for one) because I noticed a vague similarity in story tone. Oh, the one good thing... the Blu-ray pictures are ""stellar""."

3,It would be better if it wasn't like Top Gun.,To the point: -I don't like Nicole Kidman in this role -Loved the soundtrack score (Hans Zimmer is a legend) -Liked the camerawork and visuals (seems a trademark of Jerry Bruckheimer films- I really like them though!) -Can't believe Robert Towne was involved! -I do like Nicole Kidman in other roles though!
3,"The movie's incredible, the DVD sucks","This is still worth it just for the movie, which i'm not going to diss in any way. Cruise was good, Kidman was allright, Duvall was incredible, and all the rest of the cast that's in there were outstanding. The crashes were done well, and the action's defenently included. It may not be realistic, but I defenently enjoyed it. And it does display that there is more to Nascar then the redneck side of it.The DVD part of this, however, is not too cool. The only thing i'll give it a positive nod for is the Sound, which the 5.1 track displays beautifully. The Video transfer is not too peachy, with distortion being frequent. The major let-down is the lack of extras. The only thing in that department is a trailer, which is allways nice, but where's the making of feature, or commentary? At least some production notes? Cast interviews? Come on Paramount, give us at least something. But like I said, it's still worth the purchase just for the movie."
2,Not Very Good,Seemed kind of cheesy. I guess some movies don't stand the test of times. I thought it was so exciting the first time I saw it Maybe I have an extreme tiredness of Tom Cruise.
2,Would I give it more than 2 stars?,No but it might appeal to those under 70 yrs old or those like to travel in the fast lane.
1,Non-Anamorphic!,"What the heck...this is the Widescreen Collection, it should be properly made for a widescreen system.I still love this movie but am very disappointed with Paramount and the production house that produced this disc.As soon as I got my shipment I opened this and popped it in my dvd player. The actual video is 4x3 with black borders...not 16x9 anamorphic. Stay away from this, this is not how a widescreen movie should be made on DVD. This is an insult to the technology."
2,Disappointed with DVD,"I loved this movie at the cinema and rushed to get it on DVD. So why is it grainy, with bad sound, no extras to speak of and just feels very poorly done. Really really disappointed with it and have taken it back to the shop for a refund. The studio have cheated the fans on this one!"
5,EXCITING NASCAR RACING ACTION!,WOW! This film absolutely ROCKS! It takes you into the middle of a Nascar Winston Cup race! The film's semi-weak story is held brilliantly together by the film's racing sequences! Great for racing fans! Grade: A+
1,DAYS OF BOREDOM....,"THis is a typical Cruise vehicle: the ""charismatic"" character beating the ""bad"" guys in almost non-existant screenplay. How Duvall is in it, I don't know..."
1,This movie SUCKED!!!!!,"Ok, just for clarification I would have given this 0 (zero) stars if Amazon had the ability to register something that low. This movie is PATHETIC! It amounts to nothing more than Top Gun on wheels. Anyone who knows anything about racing, particularly on super speedways knows that you would never pull anything like what they pull in this movie. Running into everyone on the track, messing up your aero like that, give me a break! This movie easily ends up in a tie with Driven for worst racing movie made ever. Not that either one of these really falls into the category of ""racing"" movies. This thing just outright sucked! Save your money. If you MUST have this Cruise/Bruckheimer suck-fest then get it used on eBay or wait until it comes around on TV. Even if you tape it with commercials, you'll be appreciating the break in the mindless drivel."
2,Days of Thunder,"I collect all of Tom Cruise movies, and this just didn't do anything for me. There were one or two good parts, but I just got bored with most of it. Some points in the movie seemed like they were just thrown in just in case they needed to refer to it later."
3,TOM'S CRUISIN,"DAYS OF THUNDER is the racecar edition of TOP GUN, and as far as this type of movie goes, this one's okay...nothing spectacular. Cruise plays a rookie racecar driver who hooks up with racing legend Robert Duvall in hopes of dethroning champion Michael Rooker. An almost fatal crash leaves Cruise and Rooker with career-altering decisions, and also time for Cruise to fall in love with future wife/ex-wife Nicole Kidman, whom he met on this movie. A typical showdown ensues and the ending is appropriately fitting. Cruise is in his 80s blustery let me show you I can act stage; Duvall and Kidman are very good; Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes and John C. Reilly round out the cast and lend good support.Cruise fans probably love this movie, for me it's just an average flick."
3,Cant finish the movie!,"Not sure what the deal is since i have watched a few movies on Amazon, but this movie would stop and restart over & over. I spent too much time trying to watch this movie and had to give up. I hear it is a good flick!"
3,Great sound and action; so-so plot line,"Best Buy store managers take note: this is the movie to use to demonstrate home theater systems. It will sell your product. The surround sound effects are great. Also, you can always fast forward past the tepid and predictable boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl plot line to the next great stock car race scene. Robert Duval is not too bad, either."
1,Worst movie ever,"First of all, why would you make a movie of the most boring sport ever ""RACING"" why why why why and why, I can't believe I sat and watch this movie for 1 min, I lost 1 min of my life b/c of this movie. Well, I tell you what, I pay you not to buy this movie"
4,"Predictable, Top Gunnish, but still worth a look!","Yes - it's been said before, and it'll no doubt be said agin, this is 'Top Gun on Wheels'. Same kinda plot - boy begins to taste success, major setback, then the comeback to ultimate victory.Bruckheimer and crew do a fantastic job with cameras, actors, etc and the soundtrack is a Mr Hans Zimmer masterpiece.If you enjoy racing, this is for you, if you enjoy a story where the underdog gets up against the odds, and wins, then this is also for you.A lot have bagged this movie, riding on the heels of Top Gun's success, but then have they produced a movie that's made it to the big screen yet or what?"
1,Somebody please make a different Nascar movie.,"The biggest problem I have with this move is that's it's not a movie about racing. It's a movie about how spell-binding an actor Tom Cruise is. First-off, of all people who would be stock car drivers, Tom Cruise and Cary f**king Elwes? Nascar is badass and it needs to have a film that does it some justice. Also Nicole Kidman as a Nascar babe? Bob Duval and Randy Quaid rock. Nascar is all about mustaches and dudes named Randy. The scene at the end w/ Duval running and laughing is probably the best one in the film. Hopefully some one will make a decent alternative to this high-speed version of Cocktail. Poop. Utter poop."
4,Lossless audio in blu-ray makes this more enjoyable,The movie itself is good if you are interested in racing and the personalities of the people involved. The blu-ray video has good clarity. There are white sparkles throughout showing the age of the movie. Lossless audio is TrueHD which does add a lot compared to sd dvd. The surrounds are active in the racing scenes. LFE is good. During the nonaction scenes the volume is somewhat lower then raises significantly at times in some of the racing scenes. The only extra on the blu-ray is a trailer.
4,Days of Thunder.,"Actually I liked this movie despite tom cruise being in it, and commie robert duvall aka I like castro. this movie represents a time when Nascar was actually Exciting and worth watching it, and despite the cheesy music which is a guilty pleasure itself. A very young and skinny John C Reilly is in it.Love the sound of the cars, Even though I have never been a Nascar fan."
3,Useful starter,"Book info: I read the 1st edition that was published in 1996.Pre required knowledge or literature: NoneGeneral: The book is easy to read and does not keep repeating itself, but how could it; the book is in pocketsize and only has 75 pages.Book content:For a person new to FMEA, this book will be a good starter. For more advanced users, the book will disappoint. If you look in perspective; there is a lot of introduction (15%); examples / case study (16%) and appendix (21%); what makes the content on FMEA a bit short, but you will still get the big picture. And for only USD 6,-- the price / quality ratio seems reasonable to me."
4,The Basics of FMEA,"Good book for quick overview (and review) of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis. I would have loved more examples in manufacturing, services, healthcare, finance, not-for-profit, and government industries."
4,The Basics of FMEA Review 23 Sept 2005,I found this little handook to be very useful to me. The examples and figures provide guidance in setting up a FMEA program. Great pocket sized handbook.
2,Coloring book,"This book's title says it covers the ""basics"" of FMEA. Boy, is that right! Overwhelmingly, the material it covers is just common-sense problem-solving. (This may be true of FMEA itself.) Other advice, also just common sense, covers Group Meeting Dynamics 1 (maybe 0.5), with items like making sure everyone in a group is engaged and has a chance to speak up. Duh! A big part of the book consists of worksheets for tracking problems in various domains. I did not find these very useful, and the differences among the approaches implied by the different forms was not discussed. There's not that much more in the book than you could glean by reading the Wikipedia entry on FMEA."
1,Piece of junk,"This book is a total piece of junk, a total waste of money Information provided can be easily found on the internet. Provides very simple and guidelines on performing real-life Failure Modes Effects and Analysis."
5,Great Basics Book,This is an excellent book to get you and your team rolling on FMEA's and their application. I have been doing FMEA's for many years and found this book to be a great starter for my current team that has little or no experience writing FMEA's.
4,Good intro...and value for money!,"No frills, direct to the point. If you are looking for a simple to read, short, and to the point book, this is it. Priced very reasonable, it is a good buy.The authors would have done well to include more examples, and also explain the Tops Down, and Bottoms Up approaches to doing FMEA.I suggest you look past the few errors in the book, and learn the essence of doing FMEAs. It can get you started in a very short time."
5,HairArt Flat Iron,I love this flat iron!! I have very frizzy hair. When I use this to straighten my hair my hair is so straight and very shinny! LOVE IT... My daughter will not leave it alone I am going to have to get her one for Christmas.
5,Amazing!,"I bought this flatiron for my daughter who has very thick, medium curly hair. I have very thin, processed hair. This flatiron works perfectly for both of us! It has a dial that changes the temperature which is exactly what we needed. I use it at about 350 degrees and she uses it at 410. We are extremely pleased with it and I am looking forward to buying other Hairart products.....:)"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this product 3 times total. Once for my friend as a present and twice for myself. The product works wonderfully if it can keep from falling apart. The one I bought for my friend broke after a month and the 1st one I bought myself broke after 2 weeks. The replacement for my 1st one just broke after 7 months(taking and burning a chunk of my hair in the process). My roomate also has a hairart flat iron that broke soon after buying,in all these cases the plates fall out. In short I would not waste my money on this product. Spend it on one that will at least last a year."
1,high price poor quality,broke after 8 months on a year warranty. messages for refund and or return to the seller have not been responded to nor acknoledged. poor item lousy service-don't buy
4,COWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is cool.You can make the chickens do the chicken dance and you can make the people do that to.You can read peoples thoughes and you can pick people up throw people and you can turn into them.
5,Destroy All Humans Is Chaotic Fun,"The whole point of this THQ and Pandemic feature, is to cause as much chaos as you can. You will have the best fun with Psychokenisis which is upgradableso you could pick up cars and tanks and robots. Yes I said robots. It will remind you of GTA, Mars Attacks, and all the B-grade si-fi movies of the 1950's. 5/5 and 10/10 and two thumbs way up!"
3,"It's cool after the first five hours, but then it just gets boring!","The graphics are good, the sound is good, the humor is excellent, but to tell you people this game had a rock bottom replay value of nothing. After you've finished all the missions, all there is to do is to find the weird brain things, and after a while this can get quite frustrating. Also there is no challenge in this game, it's just mindless fun, and personally is for people who enjoy this game as much as spinning a pencil on a tabletop for hours on end. The jokes about President Bush are very funny, and so is all the rest of the humor in this game. Good for a few laughs, but after that it's just boring."
4,Mars attacks! (?),"It`s pretty obvious that this game was based on the Tim Burton flick Mars attacks! (which ain`t a bad thing) to the obvious (oh c`mon, look at capitol city, exact replica of DC; which was part of the main assalt in MA) to the not so obvious. (they both have ""!""s at the end of their titals) After you beat the game you unlock the full length 1959 B-movie: TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE.I wonder what movie DAH 2 will have....PS. what`s with the fake city names? ie: Rockwell (Roswell) Area 42 (Area 51)odd....."
1,Rip-off,"This game is basically Otto Matic in reverse! Want to blast aliens? Play Otto Matic!Seriously, this game is an Otto Matic ripoff. Pangea should sue!"
1,wont work,I hadnt realised that the American version of this game would not work on a UK console. My 14 year old newphew is very disappointed that he cant play the very popular game. Any advice on how to make it work apart from going to America would be appreciated.
3,I finally got it.,"It did take a little bit to get here, but none the less it got here. Should work out to be a freat xmas present for my son"
5,great game,"Great game, exellent price, and superb customer service blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah."
4,IMHO,"I'm a fan of B-rate scifi. This game certainly feeds my craving. It seems to have a big enough world to explore, but limits you to the ""invasion area"" for any particular mission. It gives humorous insight into the inner workings of various NPCs with telepathic powers. Has linear progression, but also allows for limited free-play. The probings and required brain extraction (brains are currency) get old after a while. Still playable, mulling over if its re-playable."
4,fun but not what i expected,when i saw the commercals 4 this game i really wanted 2 get it but now when i played it i relise its not the all star game i thought it was it is so hard there is 2 much loading and when u get so far in a mission then u fail u start the mission all over again but overall it is a good game
1,A disappointment,"I found this game to be boring and the graphics were not the best. If you like little green men, go for it."
2,funny and nice ideas... but not fun gameplay,"i'll make it short. the gamespot reviewer said destroy all humans wasn't good for its gameplay, and he was right. the idea of say, abducting someone and sucking out their brain is really cool, but in execution, it's just boring. the game does have a great sense of humor though."
4,Earth+alien= dead humans!,"Crypto, a smart alien who wants to destroy all the human race! well he's doing a pretty good job. Watch... for Crypto's shock ray!!"
5,good goody game,"This game is a must play.I recommend it for teen players and up,since you can explode peoples' heads and get their brains.Also Anal Probe them and kill anyone.Some say its too short but it is pretty lenghty and have side-quests.The game also lets you unlock a full movie of teenagers from outerspace.Its kinda funny the way you do things,and it feels like a Ratchet and Clank game.Older gamers might like this a ton,since its like old shows and the music too.Graphics:9Story:9Tilt:10Music:10Overall:9.7"
5,AWESOME GAME!,"uhuhhuhhuuh. He said anal. But seriously, if you want a free style game where you get to run around, probe people, and destroy stuff and almost go to any mission whenever you want, this is your game. I first rented this game in 2005 when it came out, and it was fun. I loved the fact that you can probe people and then make yourself look like the person you probed. I havent checked out the sequals, but, I would recommend this game for fun."
5,classic 50s si fi action,"destroy all humans is awsome, the amount of fun this game has is grater than any GTA game in stores (well not really but still preatty great). the game may have some bugs and glitches but pop this in your system and give it a go."
4,Tell All/Show All... What Are You Interested In?,"This book was like the previous book, BAD BOYS OF VIDEO. There are great photographs, both young and older versions of the person being interviewed. The author is very knowledgeable about his subjects. Most of the questions are similar between the interviews, so you can judge how each person stacks up (so to speak) among the professionals. You will get more out of the book if you know some of the people, where name dropping occurs often. I thought it was insightful into some of the lives of these 'actors'. This is a good quick read, especially on the beach."
5,A Great Read,"Having enjoyed Subterranean last year, I eagerly awaited this book. I have not been disappointed and got it shipped to the UK as soon as it was released; it is exciting and certainly a page turner. This like his previous book would make a terrific mini series. My only complaint is having to wait a year for this one and even worse news, presumably another year for the next."
3,read worse and certainly better...,"Some reviewers found this book hokie. Usually this type of book is. A good writer though, can make even a hokie book seem just a little believable. James Rollins didn't do that here. The dialogue wasn't great and often redundant. I got thru it though. Just accepted it as something quick and easy to read in spite of unbelievability. You know.... like much Science Fiction!"
1,Indiana Jones type adventure,"This book is on a par with the old Hardy Boys Mysteries. It has cardboard characters, and was pretty bad. However, I must say, I did read it to the end in one sitting, and what more can you ask of an author? I might even be willing to give the author another try. I was orginally going to say the plot was predictable, but who could imagine a catholic church full of cold blooded killer priests and an actual inquisitional torture chamber (with blacksmith type torturer, even!). Why would they have such a place? ""To keep in practice"" as the priests say in the book! I fault the editor, however, more than the author, who is fairly new at the business. All it would have taken was a stress on this group being a separatist, crazy faction, and it would have been more believable, and less crude.But, hey, if you want a couple of hours of adventure reading, with an interesting premise, it is worth that."
2,Horrible (not Horror) Story,What a ridiculous book! Preston Douglas you ought to be ashamed to have a positive comment on the front jacket of Excavation. This book does not compare to any of your excellent stories - either real or fiction. Readers - don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,Novelization is the wrong medium for this story,"I'm not going to waste time talking about plot, character development, story, writing, etc. with this book because, frankly, I would actually have to invent some sense of these things on behalf of this book in order to discuss them at all. This collection of pages would have been better suited as a screenplay for a direct-to-TV SciFi channel cheese festival film. This book is borderline absurd."
2,Stark out of reality,"Although great part of the book's fast paced, how many alien persecutions can you read in a book? How many times can they get out of trouble to find another one a sec later? So to keep this review short, after the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading the same again and again.The book's finish is scrumptiously preposterous. I don't know if there is or not some kind of alien's life somewhere in the universe. But if they had the technology described in this book they wouldn't have been discovered by anyone. Not today and not 500 years ago."
2,Needs more research,"I made it to page 22 before I found glaring errors in Mr Rollins'research. Some people might call it nitpicking BUT I am a CT tech and it irritates me to have someone talk about CT and then describe a MRI machine. CT scanners do not clank, the sound is a whirring noise that the x-ray tube makes as it rotates around the scanning bed. There are no magnets involved in CT--the CT is a modified x-ray machine designed to take a volume of information and convert the data to images showing the inside of the body. The error is akin to having a fictional surgeon using a rib spreader to do an appendectomy."
4,Excavation,"The book arrived within two days of my purchase and in good condition. It was action packed, one of Rollins' better stories."
3,Found myself skimming it.,"I liked this book, but I had to force myself to read it thoroughly. I realize that when I begin skimming or looking ahead that the book is not capturing my interest. Occasionally it might be because I just have to know how something interesting or a crisis ends up, bu in this case, I think it was just too much. Overstimulating? Unbelievable? Subterranean was much better. Although this was an entertaining read, I was just anxious to get the book done. It was a NOT a page turner."
3,pretty good,"this a pretty good book. it was a fast reader towards the end, but the ending was not as climatic as it should have been.I have read some of Mr. Rollins's other books, and they were much better."
3,"Easy reading, simple adventure","This book is an easy read with a simple adventure. I thought his first book, Subterranean, was excellent. Excavation was a fun easy read, but for me it lacked the excitement and adventure I felt in his first book. The setting takes place at an ancient Inca archaeology dig the South American mountains. The story revolves around a mysterious gold like metal and a newly discovered archaeological find. Although the story starts off in the perfect setting filled with suspense, it quickly turns in to a simple easy read story. I recommend it as quick, easy read."
5,More good stuff from Mr. Rollins,Having read Subterranean when it first came out I wasn't at all dissapointed with Excavation. A story that moves and moves. A great read.
3,"Good, but not great.","After reading Subterannean I was anxiously awaiting Rollins next book. Alas, I am here to say I could have waited a little longer for it. It starts off quick and the first half is mysterious and tense, but the second half of the book failed to live up to the first. The events in the second half were a little too improbable for my tastes. At the end of the book I felt it was a little too much of been there done that. To conclude, the book was decent but his first was a far superior read to this."
3,"Good, but no great","After reading Subterannean I was anxiously awaiting Rollins next book. Alas, I am here to say I could have waited a little longer for it.

To conclude, the book was decent but his first was a far superior read to this."
4,Fast paced,This book is faced paced and fun to read. It keeps up the intrigue throughout. Interesting and unusual premise. Probably the most scary of his books to date.
2,Silly as Silly can be,"Yes, I read this book so I'm to blame, it was so far fetched and unbelievable, I was somewhat embarrassed while reading it, so if anyone asked me if I read any good books lately? I usually kept this one to myself.Two things I didn't like were the Space Gold, and 3 tiers of existence. If you read the book you'll know what I talking about. TOO SILLY for me.However if you're only into brain candy books this is the one for you. It has Non-stop action, funny dialogue and interesting characters make this fun ""for kids."" This could make a good cartoon movie. Sorry it doesn't have that Preston and Child quality I was expecting."
2,So So,"Not one of my favorites, despite being set in one of my favorite locales. I found it difficult to get into, perhaps because Rollins mixes too much sci-fi into what I expected to be an archeolgical plot. I'm not much of a fan of paranormal fiction, and Rollins apparently is. He must have wanted to mix several genres to see how it might go over. I think you really, really have to like ""high"" adventure to appreciate this book (or be high). If you like the movie ""King Solomon's Mines"" with Richard Chamberlain, this is probably a book for you. If you expect more substance, nore believability, and want a more engrossing storyline, I'd recommend Grisham's ""Testament,"" Marcotte's ""Gold in the Shadow,"" Preston's ""The Relic,"" or even Cussler's ""Serpent."" If you liked ""Subterranean"" and enjoy Rollins' overall style, you may like it more than I did."
2,You've Seen This Movie Before,"Having enjoyed the author's previous novel _Subterranean_, I figured _Excavation_ would be just as good, but it really wasn't. Rather, it tries too hard be the next Indiana Jones movie, complete with the sort of ancient booby traps that were cool in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ but come off as derivative in this novel. Things eventually degenerate into the standard action-movie cliches, right down to the Exploding Temple and Kiss the Girl happy ending. Yadda yadda. Very disappointing, since the author can clearly do better!"
2,Disappointing,"The ending was extremely disappointing. If there had been a plausible scientific explanation at the end of the book, I would've given it 4 stars. But, in the last chapter, it seemed like Rollins was out of ideas and fell back on a lame, cop-out ending (it was all the aliens!!!). DUH? What the . . .? It made me SO mad that I had wasted all the time reading the book. I wish I could say it was worthwhile. I definitely do *not* recommend. There are far better adventures out there."
5,"James Rollins, Excavation",James Rollins is an excellent read. I have read several of his books and he WILL keep you sucked in. He leans toward the Sci-Fi in his story lines but not at the expense of believability. Bottom line - if you haven't read him - do so! Don't take my word for it.
4,Excavation,"Adventursome, yet fanciful tale. Exciting epsidoes, especially in the caverns. Very frightening ""monsters"" and setting. It makes your imagination fly!"
2,Bubble-gum for the brain,"Pure mindless entertainment is what this book is. The writing is atrocious, characters are flatter than the state of Florida, subtlety virtually nonexistent. The whole enterprise can be described in two words: Indiana Jones. If you liked that movie, you will most definitely like ""Excavation"". Is it fun to read? You bet. With the whole plot consisting of a series of adventures, each more unbelievable than the previous one, this is a perfect brain-free reading. Prepare to roll your eyes about every 15 pages or so as we're treated to various utterly lame attempts to bring characters to life by bestowing upon them a bouquet of psychological issues ranging from survivor's guilt to post-divorce romance.Apparently this is not James Rollins' first book. And since person's writing tends to improve with each successive book, I can only shudder when wondering just how much worse his previous attempts at writing were."
1,Originality?,"This was one really bad book. It pained me to read adventure book cliche after cliche. Mr. Rollins must be a big fan of Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Congo, as well as a host of other books and movies, as this book had plenty of ideas borrowed from them.My recommendation... Skip this piece of pop literature garbage and get a classic adventure novel instead. You'll be much happier."
5,Great Book!,"I am a 13 year old girl from Oregon and I am just over halfway done with this book, it's great! When I read books they have to be able to intrige me, and they have to paint an image in my head as I read, and this book, out of the many books I've read, does this. I have only read a few books that actually kept me wanting more, and this book, well I can't put it down. I have been reading it when I have spare time in class, and I keep it at school. I've only been reading it for 4 days and already I am on page 230! I hope that it will have a good ending, but I don't have any doubt. I recomend this book to everyone!!"
1,"Cheesy, corny, etc.",Give me a break. All the corny stuff you could possibly imagine packed into 420 pages. I couldn't believe the ending. I wondered why I threw away 8 bucks and a bunch of hours I'll never get back. This is my first and definitely my last James Rollins novel.
2,EVOLUTION 101,"THIS IS THE SECOND BOOK I'VE READ BY ROLLINS, AND HE SEEMS TO WRITE THE SAME BOOK OVER, AND OVER AGAIN, IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS.I READ HIS NEWEST BOOK AMAZONIA BEFORE READING THIS ONE, AND I FIND THE PLOTS TO BE VERY SIMILAR. HIS INTEREST IN WRITING NOVELS IS ONLY A MEDIA TO PREACH HIS RELIGION OF EVOLUTION. (WHICH I DON'T ADHERE TO!) THIS BOOK HAS A BIT TOO MUCH ROMANCE INTEREST FOR MY TASTE, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ACTION SCENES THIS BOOK REALLY NEEDS TO BE TRULY INTERESTING(FOR MY TASTES.) OTHER READERS HAVE COMPARED HIS BOOKS TO AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE - NOT QUITE! TRY INSTEAD MATHEW REILY'S ""TEMPLE"" IF YOU REALLY WANT AN ARCHEOLOGICAL STORY THAT ""ROCKS""."
5,One of the Best books I have ever read!,"I was in awe while reading this book! Once I started, I was completly lost in the world he had created. The charaters were great (you got to know them without unneeded detail). This book was never boring. The best part was that there was one twist after another, you never knew what was going to happen! After reading this one I went out and baought his first book."
4,Excavation,"Suspense filled, a real page turner. Rollins fans will love it, non stop action. Holds your attention from the beginning."
4,Fun & Fantastical,"Fun and fantastical story sprinkled with history and science and set in an exotic location outside of Cuzco, Peru. The hero and his uncle are both Texas A&M graduates. Both have love interests, and there is a great blend of supporting characters as well."
2,Excavation,The book has an interesting premise but the writing and especially the quoted conversations are so amateurish that one is compelled to groan at many of the highly improbable verbal exchanges.
1,forgot I was reading this book.........,"I love this type of book, but this one was very hard to stick with. The action was good, the characters had potential, great story line.It was just a bumpy ride, no flow, hard to get into. At one point I picked up another book and completely forgot about this one!The only reason I made myself finish it was because I wanted to find out the end. Pass on this, there are so many more good books!Try Patrick Lee's ""The Breach"" instead - now there is a book you will think about all day!"
2,Been there before,"James Rollins had to spend a lot of late nights watching old movies as he wrote this book because reading it felt like jumping in and out of scenes from familiar movies. First there are the obvious Raiders Of The Lost Ark scenes. Then there are there are scenes that seemed to come from The Time Machine. Throw in a touch of Star Trek: DS9, Lost Horizon, and James Bond and you've got most of the book covered.I found it hard to finish. Had I not been traveling and in need of something to kill time, I probably wouldn't have finished it. Aside from the fact that probably 85% of the book was predictable, I found the author's refrences to the Catholic religion disturbing. His words are filled with bigotry and hatred to the point that I almost felt I was reading some hate group's propaganda. AND I'M NOT EVEN CATHOLIC.It will have to take an exceedingly long, boring trip before I pick up another James Rollins novel."
1,Interesting idea + lousy writing = disappointing read,"If you're a fan of the Preston/Childs books, you might be drawn to this adventure story, but watch out. It's about as hokey as they come. From an embarrassingly bad romance between two aging archeologists to an even more embarrassing friendship between a redneck gay-basher and his new gay buddy (he learns, of course, that gays are ""just like us"") this book suffers from too much PC garbage, too much sappy dialogue, and too many derivative plot devices.I was bothered by Preston's apparent endorsement of the book (his comment, ""it's a real page turner,"" is emblazoned on the cover of the paperback). But I guess if you take Preston literally, the comment makes sense. Yes, the book is a ""real page turner"" -- I ended up skipping more of them than I actually read.If you're looking for a good adventure story in the Preston/Childs mold, try ""Neanderthal,"" or Crichton's ""Timeline."" Rollins just isn't a good enough writer to carry it off."
5,"Save this read for a rainy weekend, cuz you won't put it down!","This is my favorite Rollins book thus far. It was my first from him, although I am currently reading it again only a few months later. I've also read Amazonia, Ice Hunt, and Subterranian. Map of Bones is on my shelf. I will read anything by this author. I simply love him! His books are full of adventure, fantasy, and creatures. If you enjoy watching ""creature features"" as I do, then you'll probably like James Rollins stories. Anyhow, this one had me locked in. I was reading while walking, eating, bathing, at work. I couldn't put it down! I don't have time to delve into the details of the story, but I have to say this is one of my all time favorites that I'm sure I will read many more times over the years."
2,"Great story concept, disappointing result","From a conceptual standpoint, Excavation presents a very attractive package of adventure-style reading. Unfortunately, the author is nowhere near skilled enough to deliver on this promise. What you find are wooden, stereotypical characters and illogical plot developments, leading to the realization that the book just isn't good enough to invoke true suspension of disbelief in a discerning reader.The ending is extremely weak, following a general decline in excitement and core cohesiveness as the book progresses. In the end, I was left wondering what the concept could have been like in the hands of a more competent writer."
2,On Display - Garbage !!!,"An outstanding display of GARBAGE !!! This is the second book by him that I read (the first was The Judas Strain - a little bit better than this one). Thousands of Tarantulas, hoards of Monster Cave-Dwellers and add a lost Inca Tribe. Why waste your time on this author when they are some Good Authors out there ???"
3,Fun,"I got hooked from the first page and couldn't put it down until the last. It was so fast-paced that I didn't even realize I was almost done until the end. However, I was a little dissapointed in the end that seemed a little too far-fetched to me and over-the-top. But I love Rollins and this won't deter me from reading his books. Always looking forward to more Rollins."
2,Characters please - not cartoons,"Ever read a book that just screamed - ""Make this into a movie that teen age boys will go see?"" Heavy on action, quick paced plot and characters drawn with crayon... oh and the perfect hollywood action flick ending.If anyone else has read the book... Maggie's seizures... dehabilitating and then they disappear, completely gone ""poof"".Oh, and the bad guys? Well, nobody ever expects them ;-)Not even a twinge of piety? - and the sadistic drooling torturer - geez! ""Central casting... big guy, balding, big belly - leacherous looking would be good... just for one scene - oh, would be good if he was comfortable around pyrotechnics""Save a few bucks - wait for the movie - or maybe just the DVD."
2,Needs more excavation,"This is, in my opinion, a really poorly written book. Had read Subterranean and thought it was much better, although suffering from some of the same problems. The author uses all of the stereotypes you can imagine-blacks die, gays are weak, Texans are heroes, etc. The language sounds like a grade-B movie of 50 years ago. A 30 minute plane ride in the Andes is described as being a four hour flight. The best thing about the book is the plot, and it's pretty weak. Very little technical research done,if any, for this book. I won't buy this author again."
2,almost 3 stars,"The book was a fun trashy adventure novel to read, but the ending just blew chunks. I couldn't believe it was so corny. That doesn't take away from the rest of the book, there were several engaging characters, and the adventure was certainly there, but if you are looking for substance, well.. find something else. With such a fun story to be brought to a close so poorly just ruined the book for me."
2,Not great,"The beginning of this book was very dynamic and really pulled me in, and the plot I really did like as it had a great Indiana Jones feel to it. But the characters were made of cardboard and unbelievable, with the dialogue between them almost painful. So much so I just gave up on the book two thirds of the way through."
2,Same old story,"The book started out very well, seemed to have a good story line and an engaging story line. Had a little of Indiana Jones at the beginning when they were trapped in the cave. Then the plot turned to the same old story line, I think the Rollins books use the same story line and just change the hero's and setting. Again, too much sci-fi. I was given many of the Rollins books for Christmas, I wished the money would have been spent on something else. I have 5 more books to read, I just hope one of them comes close to a Cussler or Ludlum novel."
1,Bizarre story,"This book starts well, so you get drawn into the characters to some extent. At about 75% through you realise you have just wasted 3 hours reading this crap. Ludicrous story topped off with a even more ludicrous twist that is explained in the last page as an afterthought.This should have been a B grade telemovie. The premise is OK, just really badly implemented in the last half of the book. I want my money and my time back!"
2,Totally unbelievable,The reason the novels of Child and Preston are so good is that they give the reader a glimmer of the possibility that the supernatural events that they are reading about might just be possible. Not with this writer. Totally unbelievable.
2,Waste of Time,"I had such high hopes for this book. Thank heaven, someone gave it to me for it is not worth the money to buy it. I liked neither the heroine nor especially the hero. Dead characters, no charisma. I plugged thru to the end and was relieved to finish it. Get it from the library."
2,"This book started great, but then it went to the dumps.","When a person finds a dead body in the basement, you call the police. I can not believe that Tess did not do that. After that the book seemed to go down hill. I figured out that Ike was the skeleton and who had killed him before I was even half way through the book.I did enjoy the interactions of the characters to each other. I really enjoyed Dolly Thorne's daughter, the little princess. I like that Tess was not any wimp by any standards, and the fact that she was not perfect in figuring out the mystery. I would not recommend this book for the suspense, but I would recommend this book as a good romance."
5,Good little mystery!,"What started out a little slow, grew into a really exciting story. I hadn't expected it to be so exciting, but it was."
2,Good start and then faded into boredom,"I have read two other books by Carla Neggers, On Fire and Night Scents, both were romantic and fairly suspenseful but what appealed to me the most was that they were well written. The Carriage House started out pretty well and I was excited to start another of her books but several chapters into the book I noticed a big change; the characters had turned to cardboard and most of what they said was stupid and forced. The romance and the suspense had turned to pure boredom. I started wondering if Carla had written the first few chapters and someone else had finished to book for her. It just wasn't the same caliber of author from the first two books I had read."
2,Started well... then went downhill,"As a great fan of romantic suspense, I was really excited by the premise and the interesting beginning of the novel... but as it went along I found myself getting frustrated and wanting to throw the book across the room. Tess's (the heroine's) thoughts seemed to jump around, stupid choices were made (for a supposedly smart woman) and scenes and dialog were sometimes hard to follow. Motivations were often unclear and information omitted. The relationship between Tess and Andrew was very tepid - there was little hint of true passion and growing affection between them, and their meager love scenes were mediocre. The characters of Dolly and Harl were sweet and/or quirky, but not enough to rescue the novel's flaws. I felt sadly let down at the end and expected better of Carla Neggers. I'm not sure that I would buy this author again."
5,Vacation read,I recently read this book on my weekend trip to Palm Beach. It was a great relaxing read! Highly reccomended! Lots of fun!
1,Where's the Surprise?,"I'm on page 155 of this book and there have only been two ""real"" events: Tess finds a skeleton in her cellar, which she doesn't have enough courage or smarts to do anything about, and Dolly's cat had four kittens. Guess how the book is going to end: Andrew, the ""mysterious"" hunk next door, and Tess fall madly in love .. ho hum, ho hum.. and the skeleton turns out to be somebody's ancestor or planted there to scare poor Tess away. No wonder men don't usually like women authors! This is hardly on a par with Lisa Scottoline, Patricia Cornwall, Eileen Goudge or even Mary Higgins Clark. Although I usually read a good book in a day or two, I've added the task of reading 50 pages a day to my list of daily chores. Also irritating is the fact that the book is titled ""The Carriage House"" and although the cover portrays various houses, there is no carriage house among them. Apparently not even the artist read this book."
5,Best Auction Introduction,"This book is quite useful if you want and/or need an overall introduction to the Auction Process both in the Business field and in the private management of eBay auctions.I used it for understanding how companies organize their e-procurement.In particular this book is among those few dealing with Covisint, which is a common auction platform for automotive brands.It starts with very simple concepts and classifications of auctions and ends up with real examples. I would rather advise ""The Auction-App"" only for those who want to get in touch with B2B approach to auctions.It does really worth its price."
3,Too basic but full of examples and references,"This book is too basic if you're counting on it to earn big bucks. It does touch a few aspects of opening a online auction business - finding the right marketplace, marketing, etc. However, the lessons are too basic which I think most of us already knew it without reading this book.The biggest benefit of this book is lots of examples & reference. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the book is case studies, resources/reference. So you're already know how to run online acution business but just lack of information, this is it. If not, better look somewhere else.I only recommend this book to people who know about online auction business but just don't have time to collect information themselves. This is an easy solution."
2,Item Description,"The Amazon product description states the crochet hooks to be 8.8 inches long. In reality, the length is nearly 7.0 inches. While the size of the hook is adequate, the length is not. I have ordered these items from both JoAnn and eSticker. All the hooks (sizes M and N) were only 7 inches long, and not the 8.8 inches stated. Also, the small image does not covey much of the detail of the crochet hooks."
3,a little high,"I bought this pillow since my old contour pillow was just that - old. The Contour Cloud Pillow is not for someone who likes soft pillows! I did look at their commercial and they say it's so soft it even molds to your ear. Well, it's actually pretty hard. But I don't mind that all that much. However it was really high so that my head was not aligned with my spine. That resulted in neck pain and headaches. I had two choices: either put it in a corner and buy a new one or think about how to change the pillow. Well, I got out a sharp, long bladed knife and cut off a little bit from the blue foam layer. Not too much but just a little bit. Now it's great! I don't mind it being hard but now it's finally the right height. This might be unconventional but I thought it couldn't hurt since otherwise I wouldn't have used it at all. The result is that I sleep very well and I really like the crescent shape."
3,"Contour Cloud Pillow, Standard","Very good for sleeping sideways, not excellent for sleeping on back (too high). A slightly too rigid material and therefore the so called memory foam is hardly noticeable. Relatively good price."
3,Not quite,"I'm a side sleeper and have been searching for the perfect pillow for a long time (you should see the pile of rejects on my spare room bed) This one is too hard and too low. I'm actually currently using it while I continue my search. The addition of a 1"" layer of soft squishy memory foam (from another reject) on top makes it better, but still not quite right."
1,Curved edge is uncomfortable,"I am returning this pillow after trying it out for about 10 minutes. The curved part of the pillow is OK to sleep on if you ONLY sleep on your side, but if you lay on your back and far enough up on the pillow for neck support, the projecting edges poke you in the shoulders. This is built for someone with 10"" wide shoulders, or some species with an odd anatomy, perhaps with a hump-back or dorsal fin. Weird. I liked my old Contour Pillow that had straight sides, and without the memory foam. The memory foam on this one is too hard. Just not comfortable all around. I see it's out of stock now. I would recommend that Amazon leave it that way."
5,The best pillow on the market,I have used these pillows before and I recommend them to anyone who gets up in the morning feeling neck or back pain. This will align everything properly and allow you to sleep more comfortable. Try it the benefits are worth it.
4,love the shape,"I found this pillow to be very comfortable. The positioning of my head and neck for either back or side sleeping felt great. It took a few nights to get accustomed to, but I'm used to at least two fluffy pillows swallowing my head every night--thus the sore neck in the morning. I wish they offered various firmness options upon purchase,as it it is a bit too firm for my taste, but the positioning is worth it!"
4,Works GREAT for the lower back,"I bought this pillow because they said it would keep me cool. It doesn't get as hot as others I have tried, but I still have to turn it to get that ""cool"" spot. I do however have lower back pains and find this pillow EXTREMELY helpful when sitting. It is a bit of a harder pillow, but I don't mind it because I will make my head find it's own niche once I lay down and it is comfortable. There have been nights where I get my old pillow out, but I always go back to the cloud pillow. I have been using this pillow now for a month and still like it. Do NOT expect a standard size in this pillow however, it is much smaller than standard."
3,Comfortable but STINKY!!!,"I bought this pillow for my husband. It took a little getting used to comfort-wise, but the hardest part was tolerating the smell! We had to air it out for days to get rid of the ""chemical smell"" emanating from the pillow."
2,"Great shape,WAY TOO FIRM","My husband has a NEARLY identical pillow which has the same shape and the blue foam base but the top layer is foam rubber instead of memory foam. It is by far the best pillow I have ever used(and I have tried MANY-I run a chiropractic clinic). Unsuccessful for years searching for another, I was hopeful for this one. The memory foam is way too firm, so I sliced it off with an electric knife, added 3- 1"" foam layers to the blue base and I am close to the perfect pillow. Still searchering for one that will require less modification!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"This pillow's ok, but it's certainly not the best. The first few nights that I had it, I slept great - but probably because my previous pillows were terrible and I hadn't been sleeping. Once I got used to it, that's when I noticed that I didn't find it comfortable. The problem is that the curve doesn't fit my neck properly. Even with the notch cutout, my neck is not long enough to comfortably fit the curve. I actually find it more comfortable to turn the pillow so I'm still using the curve, but use the non-notched side. The pillow is a good density and provides good neck support, but if you have a shorter neck, this may not be the pillow for you."
3,Nice pillow but not better than the one from walmart.,"I purchased this pillow to replace one from walmart that my dog had chewed up!!! I thought it would somehow be better and more durable. Well I was wrong. I don't even use it the way that you are supposed to becuase the cut out curve almost eliminates the lift you get from the coontour. I've fliped it around and it works pretty good, but not any better than the one from walmart!!"
2,Disappointed... :(,"I bought this pillow as it had very positive reviews. A lot of people said it was superior to other memory foam pillows. Unfortunately, I did not find that to be the case at all. As a petite woman with broad shoulders and a long neck I need a lot of firm support. Not only is this pillow too soft, but it's also too thin! Regular memory foam pillows work much better for me. Now, if only I'd kept the box so I could return this expensive item!!"
1,Be Careful,"I was told by my chiropractor that my neck was not aligned, so I thought I would try this pillow to help support while I slept. I sleep on my side and my back both during the night. The first couple nights I didn't really notice because my back/neck was already in pain, hence looking for a new pillow. Finally after about a week, the pain in my upper back/shoulders/lower neck became unbearable. Last night in the middle of the night, I threw this pillow on the ground and grabbed my old one for the remainder of the night, and when I woke, the pain was less. I'm visiting the chiropractor again today, bringing the pillow with me to ask his opinion. I can't help but think the pillow had something to do with my increased neck/back pain...just be careful, make sure you choose the right one for your position and shoulder height and all that. Depending on what my chiropractor says, I may be returning this pillow."
4,Scientific bibliographic software,"I have just switched over to EndNote from Papyrus. Movement of my old files has been straightforward, if a bit tedious. Some critical information that EndNote should be able to process automatically needs to be done by hand.I have been very happy with my ability to download citations with their abstracts from the web. After years of manual entry, this new system is a dream."
4,Great Product,good sound qualitymy kids have not wrecked it yet (a big plus)best of all no cords to get in the way when working
3,"ok, but not worth 40 USD","the cable it comes wit really short. for the size. it's suppost to sound better than it does. it has no bass, n fits really slack on the head. n i got a (big head) the padding on the ear piece also comes off alot. had 2 crazy glue the buggers in place"
5,My favorite purchase EVER!!!!,"I bought these as a Christmas gift to myself and with being on a tight budget these days, I didn't want to spend too much?! I knew what I wanted but couldn't find it until I called customer services and the gentlemen on the phone told me about these and even he couldn't believe how much they were selling for! My ipod just slides right in the slot and I'm ready to go, I don't have to worry about those little ear things falling out all the time when I move suddenly or move my arms to pick things up. These stay put even when I'm hitting my punching bag during a vigorous work out! I still can't believe the sound quality of these headphones. My husband took one look at them and started laughing at me and asked when the next plane was landing?! I said, ""listen to this for a second."" He stopped laughing instantly and just listened... I had to chase him to get them off his head!"
3,My thoughts,"I found the book to be a little bit boring. I wanted to know how to change my home to fit into the Feng Shui philosophy and it gave me more of a background of Feng Shui. That is great, I am glad I know all of that now, but I didn't find any practical ways to change my home."
3,Not so simple,"I'm still trying to get into this book. There is a lot of subject matter with mulitple origins, interpretations and applications of feng shui. Whew! I'm not finding this KISS publication to be that simple. However, lots of info and pictures!"
4,COSCO SCENERA CONVERTIBLE CAR SEAT,"I purchased this car seat for my 10 month old grandson. I think it is a good car seat for the money. The instructions are a little hard to understand but maybe thats because Ive been out of the ""baby mode"" for too many years. I have a Mustang and it even fits in the back seat just fine. Good buy for the money"
4,Mad dogs and Southerners,"Summary review of how the pre-Civil War old South was a pretty militant, war-obsessed place. Franklin looks at the South's obsession with personal honor, dueling, the rise of military schools, and an endless amount of breastbeating. The author doesn't probe too deeply beneath the surface, and the book has a ""introductory"" feel to it. Very good as far as it goes, however."
2,Disappointed--not for the regular vacationer,"I wanted this book because my husband and I are planning a week's vacation to Paris. I found this book pretty much useless for our purposes. The book is arranged in one-page primers on various subjects. The vast majority of the subjects are about French history or music or whatnot. There is some information about business etiquette that could potentially be useful for the business traveler.But I find the title to be a misnomer. It isn't a book about doing things the French way. There are very few cues on how to avoid faux pas. This is not a useful book for the average traveler, and I'm sorry I bought it. I've considered returning it, but am not sure the $9 I paid for it is worth the hassle of packing it up, sending it off, etc etc."
4,American Tragedies,"If one is interested in the Leo Frank case, this book is a must. It includes a tremendous amount of detail on his trial and subsequent appeals. And more importantly, the book allows us to understand how his lynching was planned, carried out, and covered up. It is a rather long book, but it is written in a compelling style, and because of this I think that most readers will find it difficult to put down.I have read other books that deal with the series of events covered in this book and in terms of information this book dwarfs all of those other works. Nevertheless, even after reading this volume I found myself wanting to know more and I assume that others will feel the same way."
5,This is a heartwrenching story that anyone should read,I grew up in Atlanta and heard this story whispered.Steve Oney has researched this so thoroughly. It has always been a story that has been shrouded in shame. I'm so sorry that the people who lynched Leo Frank (and they lynched him in so many ways) were never punished. I'm sorry that families like my own were too afraid to speak up and challenge the powerbrokers.I hope that readers will see the good people as well as the evil ones. I hope that Leo Frank will forgive us all for our silence.
4,Important Story,"I have not read this book from start to finish yet; however, I bought the book after much research on this particular trial. The musical 'Parade' is what sparked my interest, so this book is a wonderful way to supplement the things I already knew of the case."
3,Non-philospher's opinion,"I have an interest in philosophy, but no background in the subject. I grabbed this book in hopes that it would act as a good primer. I've not finished it, but I've gotten far enough through it to see that it's not very helpful to me. It starts out with what amounts to a laundry list of names that mean nothing to me, and overly self-important language that is meant more to demonstrate the intelligence of the authors than to convey much meaning. The book utterly fails to define what postmodern theory is, except to say that it is different from modern theory, and there may be some tension between the two schools.I'm not quite sure who the audiance for this book is. People who already know philosophy won't need it, and people who aren't already hip can't understand it.I'm going to continue to plow through the work, and will report back if my opinion changes upon completion."
3,Gift Purchase,Arrived in good time. As a gift I could not rate its quality. Consider revising this form.
4,Very interesting compilation,"This album contains one of my favourite-ever remixes: the Deathprod mix of 'Kakonita'. NPM's trumpet is stretched, repitched and reverbed into a ghostly, cavernous work, and at only 3.5 minutes practically demands repeat play. Conversely, Herbert's opening mix of 'Merciful' is a strange, ambulatory extension of the brief original. Like most of the rest of the tracks, Nils' trumpet is a contrasting feature among all the electronica. Much better than your average electronica compilation."
2,"Very narrow, size UP!","These shoes are beautiful & if you have a narrow foot, will be fine but they are sized small. I would estimate that a US 10M are actually a 9 - 9.5 maybe a medium width."
1,Will the real Saturday Evening Post please stand up?,"I was very excited and pleased to receive as a gift several recent copies of The Saturday Evening Post magazine. I remembered the issues I read in the time of my youth and looked forward to time to read these new issues. The name of the magazine is the same and there are still cartoons, maybe even more cartoons, that are witty. Other than those two things, the new magazine is nothing like the magazine one thinks of when one says The Saturday Evening Post. This magazine is an impostor using an honored name to profit while peddling fluff and hype. Of course, keep in mind that I was looking for something from my youth and that is not always reasonable nor realistic. Don't buy it for its name or you'll likely be disappointed. However, without preconceived expectations, you may fine the magazine enjoyable."
2,"This Is a Joke, Right?","I was suprised to see that the Saturday Evening Post was still being printed. I happened to get a chance to examine a few of the ""new"" issues the other day. I guess they've gone through a format change from what I remember as the older magazines. It was almost like reading a satire of a badly made magazine. At first, I thought the magazines' only value could be the reprints of old artwork by Norman Rockwell and Liendecker. But the ""new"" material was so bad, it had to be done on purpose. I laughed out loud several times durring my review. I'd reccomend this magazine to anyone who enjoy the Sun, the Globe, the Weekly World News, or any print gurus who want to see how NOT to craft a magazine. It's a shame that they couldn't continue to make a respectable body of material for their readers. I'm sure Rockwell and Liendecker are rolling in their graves right about now."
5,AWESOME BOOK,I went to a catholic book shop and picked up this book. I started reading it the same day and could not stop as it was so interesting. I would recommend this book to any catholic interested in history from faith perspective. I would give 5 star to this book anytime as it is worth every penny.
2,Readable but problematical,"As a traditionalist Catholic and a professional historian, I cannot recommend this book whole heartedly.This book is a passable Catholic introduction to world history. Maybe I should say, a Catholic tweak on world history. By trying to Catholicize history, the author provides a fresh look but makes no contribution and actually distorts many issues.There are major advantages to this book. It gives a point of view not normally found in other texts. It covers history in a readable style. It is primarily a survey book.There are major cons. The author ignores the contributions of major civilizations or glosses oevr them. The author also attributes ideas to time periods where they did not enter into play. Take, for example, the idea of distributism.I would recommend this book as additional reading but not as the main textbook in schools or hoemschool history programs."
2,"""World history"" is a very misleading description","It was only after buying the book that I noticed on the back cover that it was a mostly Western European history. Hardly any mention was made of Asia, the largest continent in the world. Many events occurred there that had far reaching influence on the rest of the world. Yes, this book is very biased and not one I would use if I really wanted to know about the whole world. The author is a talented writer in the sense that it's a book you feel compelled to keep reading till the end."
1,disgusting,this book is so ridiculously bias that it even made me at one stage laugh anne w carol instead of writing how things really were writes wot she thinks would make the catholics look good in every aspect.she focuses too much on silly unimportant observations and does not give the plain facts unlees she has altered them first to make them suite the message she tries to get across wich is catholics all throughout history are perfect and anyone who is not is evil .Her figures of deaths in the tudor times are amazinly inacurate she claims mary tudor had 102 peaple executed Elizabeth to have killed 800 and henry 600 i suggest that unlees you find it in a rubbish bin it is not even worth ridiculing
1,I sincerely hope this is a joke of some kind.,"I don't want to rate the book, as I haven't read it, but the title alone tells me it's either heavy-handed satire or an educational travesty. For the sake of your kids, I hope it's satire."
1,The issues with this book,"I am a homeschooled, Cradle Catholic, (and our family isn't the type to only go on holidays, meaning we go to Mass every day, etc). For my history class, our family uses these books. I am big about my Catholic faith, but I cannot recommend this book to people. First off, it presents a VERY biased view of history. Everything revolves around the Church, and while God is the center of our existence, the entire world did not revolve around Catholicism. Another problem is the fact that the viewpoint presented is: If you are not Catholic, you are evil. If someone was Protestant, they are automatically evil, and while there was some truly evil non-Catholics in history, the same goes for the Catholics.All in all, this book seems to be spouting off as much Pro-Catholic, Anti-Everything-Else propaganda as possible. And the history facts are very distorted as well."
5,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ!!!,"I am a student of Seton High School in Manassas Va ([...]) - a notable private school that was founded by none other than Anne Carroll. She is my World History 2 teacher! Dr. Warren Carroll assists her in her classes most of the time. Dr. Warren Carroll founded the Catholic college Christendom. They are both amazing people who dedicate their lives to teaching the truth. Both have spent years researching Christian history, and I am blessed to be taught by them."
4,Sonny the seal game,This game is fun for about 5 minutes and the kids are tired of it and pull the rings apart. I would have been better off buying a set of rings. My 2 and 3 year old did find the game fun but it did not keep their attention for very long.
2,Sonny the Seal Game,Our boys like Sonny but his flippers just won't stay on! The rings come in 2 halves and don't stay together at all. Sonny's barking and movements are cute but the kids need constant help with putting the flippers back on and the rings together.
2,The Three Astronauts,"We purchased this book for our son whose reading material is at the 4 to 8 yrs level.This is a picture book & the story is about three astronauts (one from USA, one from China & one from Russia) who find themselves together in a situation where they learn to overlook their differences & learn to work together.Our only disappointment with this book is the symbolic representations (illustrations) used to depict the three astronauts. Our son was expecting to see the astronauts depicted as people. The astronauts are represented by three pieces of paper - the American is a piece of chewing gum paper, the Russian & Chinese are represented by pieces of paper with Russian & Chinese script. While I can see merit in the concept, I really do think this level of comprehension is beyound that of a child."
4,Silverware Chest with lots of storage,This chest has a lot of storage and seems to be fairly well made. My only complaint is that they didn't include enough screws for the legs. Otherwise my flatware has found a new home in a lovely looking chest.
5,Getting Serious,"I have been an admirer of Gordon Weaver's short stories since I read ""Getting Serious"" (winner of the Best American Short Story in 1980 and included in this collection) twenty years ago. I won't say that it is the ""best"" short story I ever read - but I will say that it is one of the few that I have come back to again and again because of the way it speaks to me about life, loss and memory - the way each of us ""fictionalizes"" our past to make sense of it and how the dreams and aspirations of our youth collide with the realities of middle age. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Weaver in 1992 in Stillwater, OK before he retired from his english professorship and tell him how important his work had been. Highly recommended."
5,Dickens Package 1,"This collection is an embarassment of riches. Each story is divided into several episodes which take time to view and absorb. So far we have only viewed ""Bleak House"" and ""Our Mutual Friend"". Both are excellent and capture the steamy world of Dicken's London. I think I am constantly amazed at the attention to detail that the Brits recreate in historical drama. And of course there is the wealth of character playing for which Britain has always been famous. A really excellent series."
5,Charles Dickens BBC DVD Reviews,"I have been deeply impressed with the quality of BBC films which I purchased last month. Character development is a big plus with me. Although there is a major plot in each of the Dickens stories, there are also numerous sub plots. I have ordered additional works presented by BBC and hae enjoyed them all."
4,Pretty good!,"I'd rate this product higher if Closed Captioning were available. Also, at least one of the programs (Oliver) is rather ""old,"" and looks & feels dated due to how it was filmed or taped, but if you can deal with that, it's a wonderful story, and well told. Really enjoyed Martin Chuzzlewit (having never seen or read it before), and I know I love Our Mutual Friend (which is the reason I bought the set in the first place). I do love these miniseries that take the necessary time to tell the story & capture the feel & intent of Dickens."
2,"The Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 1","The BBC produced this series which means that quality is top-notch. I cannot recommend this item! If you are a die-hard literature buff, this is for you. But I think that people who speak American contemporary English will be hard pressed to overcome the old world British English spoken.It is woven into a thick accent of 1700's - 1800's slang, with the nuances of the Englishes' English. By missing those nuances, the flavor of the times and the meanings are missed. The cover of the DVDs claim closed caption, THEY LIED!!!"
1,The Charles Dicens Collection Volume 1,Watch out because the Our Mutual Friend movie only got half way through and then seemed to get stuck and wouldn't go any further. I tried it on 3 different players with the same result.
3,the Charles Dickens collection,"The films appear to be well done and the actors are quite good. The quality of the film is not so good. On two of them, I found that they did not play well at all during parts of the play, breaking into pixels and then stopping completely. This appears to be a flaw in the DVDs rather than in the original materials. The lighting is quite dark - but much of Dickens is dark, so how could it be otherwise. I'm not talented at understanding the accents of some of the actors, especially the female ones, but this is my fault and not that of the materials.Overall, they were quite good and well worth the cost. I would buy more like this."
4,"Good acting, lots of dialogue, low budget sometimes shows","I see other reviewers have given this set 5 stars. I cannot quite justify 5, overall, which for me, means pretty much everything has to be right. These books on DVDs are fairly true to the Dickens originals. The actors, for the most part, do their jobs well. Of course, Dickens was a genius of a writer, so no complaints with the stories at all. What I found a bit negative, though, are the sets, and at times, the costumes. Even the lighting and cinematography has a rather obvious low budget look about it. Think made-for-TV, then also think low budget, soundstage instead of location, and you will have the idea. These are not bad discs, but just don't expect them to look like Hollywood productions, because they definitely will not. Packaging is nice, with each disc having its own binder."
5,As expected...,"the combination of Dickens and the huge pool of actors available to the BBC produces an unbeatable package. Seen a slightly better Bleak, never a better Chuzzlewit. There's no better value than this. Do your family a favour- buy it."
4,Dickens Lovers,I bought this for my Dad for Christmas. He is a huge Charles Dickens fan and has all of the movies on tape. He finally upgraded t.v.s and can no longer use his v.c.r. so I finally upgraded him to DVDs. This set has a great collection of the classic Dickens movies and is a great gift for fellow Dickens lovers.
5,The Charles Dickens Collection vol 1,The product is excatly what i expected and is what I wanted to buy. I think it is a good value as well.
3,Complex college course book.,"Talk about a hard read, this book is not for the literary amateur or someone looking for a fast paced and exciting read. Although it is rich with descriptions and definitely one of Joyce's better works, the story itself is tedious and hard to follow. The actual physical book quality was standard and the price is decent."
2,Dated material...... better material out there!,"I have been playing bass for quite some time, but realize that there is a super limited to non existent choice on books on the subject of tapping on bass. Your best off buying the E-book Mechanics of tapping or Beaver feltons book on the subject as they are far superior to this book. The examples are non inspiring and the speed at which every exercise is executed is annoyingly slow. Slow is good, but too slow is boring beyond belief. I owned the slap version of this book years ago... I got rid of it due to it's lack of content or info....... this one does better, but still falls flat. Good if your an absolute beginner, but again..... better choices these days."
2,Rose Quartz Pendant,Silver Insanity Sterling Silver Rose Pendant. I am disappointed with the pendant. It is very large and the quality is not as viewed in picture.
3,Who the crooner is,The Italian crooner music NOT contained on the CD is available on the CD Alberto Rabaagliati in the series Le grandi voci della canzone italiana. One of the prominent crooner songs in the movie seems to be his recording of Mattinata Fiorentina.
3,"Nice, but not quite what I had hoped for.","I loved this film, and all through it I kept telling myself I was going to find its soundtrack as soon as possible so I could hear all its great period songs again. Unfortunately, the CD's description on this site didn't include a list of its song titles -- and I was quite dismayed to discover when I finally received the CD that it contained only the background orchestral scoring and not the '30s/'40s Italian crooner ballads that so captivated me in the film. The music on this CD is pretty and appropriately lush and evocative, but it is as forgettable as it was when it made no impression on me in the theater."
5,What A Wonderful Book,"This book on familiars by Raven Grimassi is really a great book. It gives some really great information, and offers a new way of thinking. The book is used, and is in wonderful shape."
1,Western money belt,I have never received the belt but my account has been charged for it. Can you help me?
5,meditation for a day,This wonderful book provides a biblical quote for every day and a short meditation on it. It provides something to ponder during those free moments during the day when you wish to turn your thoughts to God and refresh your spirit for the tasks at hand.
5,Daily Prayer,I am extremely happy with this book- It is great for daily prayer and meditation and good use for expanding your spiritually.I use it every day- the book was delivered as promised and is in great condition.
3,Thomas Keating,The words from sacred scripture chosen for daily consumption are selected from many sources and reach through the page to inspiration.
2,Too Expensive,$24.95 is way too expensive for a book that is only 100 pages. Other than that the content in the book is good.
2,Disappointed,"...This version of Outburst (Ultimate)seems to have been thrown together, for the sole purpose of cashing in on the success of the original Outburst(which was excellent). Categories are repeated (""GLASS"" and ""THINGS MADE OF GLASS"") and the idea that the repeated words on the cards is meant to be 'part of the game' is ludicrous. The object of the game is to come up with TEN items for the category, not 3 items plus 4 ways of saying the same item! Sloppy quality control if you ask me."
1,Stick to the original Outburst game,"I couldn't believe how BAD this game was. Most cards often have several of the same answers listed. For example: suitcase, a suitcase, the suitcase. I am not joking. It was so prevalent I called the company. They said it is supposed to be that way since people often shout out the same answer! But nowhere in the directions does it tell you to keep shouting out the same answers because they may be listed two or three times. Some cards actually only had 4 or 5 different answers & those answers were just repeated to make the list of 10. It's stupid. My sister was in a marketing/previewing group for this game. It wasn't that way when they previewed it. The new twists on the game such as Reverse Outburst are a good idea, but you can do that with the old game."
4,Great Icebreaker Party Game,"Outburst is the game of choice when you've got a crowd together and you want to get everyone talking.It's easy to play, and does not require everyone to be sitting in any particular arrangement, or even at the table together, making it a great Game Night party starter.It's also perfect when you need to add or remove players from a team during the course of the game without disturbing the game in progress."
5,outburst. not ultimate outburst,"I bought a number of games before christmas. outburst was the most fun. I played it one-on-one, with medium group at a family party and at work with about 50 clients in 2 teams. It worked for all combinations. I'd like to see if Ultimate outburst has different cards. I see it's not availabe. Too bad."
3,"GREAT CONTENT, MEDIOCRE PRESENTATION","This book contains most anything you'd like to know about this TV show but I was very dissapointed that, with such a high price, there are hardly any photos (all are in B&W), the book is rather small and it doesn't even have a cover jacket. Anyway, the contents are as good as can be expected and the subject makes it a must buy (of sorts !) for fans of the show."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge 'N Sync fan, and this cd wasn't all that great. The interview was from 2 years ago. The main feature was a British guy talking REALLY slow. And they play the same stupid background music the ENTIRE time. There's nothing on it that you don't already know. Save your money and buy something else! I wish I had!"
4,Great product!,It was so good.I couldnt believe how great the cd was.U dont want to miss out.Or ull be sorry! I know I'm not!!!
4,"like it, but Fairytopia (Mermaidia) is similar.............","I liked this movie, but it was similar to Barbie Mermaidia. Why do they have 2 mermiad movies? anyway, besides that and a goofy song 'she's the queen of the waves', it was a pretty good film. not THAT good, like the best movie ever, but pretty good."
5,best barbie movie yet,"This movie was clearly depicted during present day. All the tech gadgets were very cool.My ""almost"" 4 year old grandaughter LOVED it. The music, the clothes (fashion), surfing and gadgets were all her favorite things. She now wants a cellular wrist watch phone and so do I........She has since seen it 8 times and neither of us have tired of it.Of course it is a similar story line as some of the others yet different enough that I consider it to be the best one yet."
2,worst barbie movie yet,"the story line of this movie was weak. even my 8 year old said it was ""lame"" and she's enjoyed every barbie movie so far. i wasn't bothered by the so called ""spiritual"" or ""psychic"" parts in this [FANTASY] movie, but they are (barely) there if you feel that will somehow damage your child.what bothers me the most are the shortcuts the animators took. they are glaringly obvious! all of the male and female characters in crowd scenes are exactly the same! did they feel they could skimp somewhere because the main characters hair and clothes moved for the first time?seems to me a fast food production meant to do nothing more than hock more dolls. there are cute bits and the animal sidekicks are cute, but this is not what i expect from mattel. i suggest skipping this one."
4,Mermaids,I bought this for my little girl. She has been watching it at least once a day since we got it.
3,Barbie movie,"This was alright, my grand daughter wanted a Barbie movie so I got it It doesn't really hold her attention long but she is only 4. good news is, it was as described and delivered in record time."
4,Granddaughter loves it,My 3 year old granddaughter is just getting into Barbies. She loves this video and asks to watch it over and over.
4,Daughter loves it,I bought the movie for my daughter cause she got 1 of the Barbie DVDs for Christmas. I figured she'd want some more of the Barbie movies so I started a wish list with all of them in it & had her select the next 1 to get. As soon as we got this 1 she watched it immediately and has watched it numerous times since then. I think this 1 is her favorite cause she hasn't wanted to watch the others since getting it.
5,mom to barbie lovers,"Both daughters, 2 and 6, love the movie. Cute theme, cute movie. And there are barbies that they can play with at the same time!!!"
5,Great movie!!,I got this for my girls (6 and 2) for Christmas and they love it!!! Would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
5,GOOD GIFT ITEM,GRAND KIDS REALLY ENJOYED THIS GIFT. MAKES A GREAT GIFT TO GIVE TO THE LITTLE KIDS. CAME AS EXPECTED AND THE KIDS ENJOY IT
5,Best Kids Dance Song Ever,"It is an adorable movie with a cute dance for girls to learn. My kids and I both know the dance ""Queen of the Wave"" and we dance to it all the time."
5,PERFECT!!!!!!!,"Okay, I didn't get this movie from Amazon but I got it somewhere else but this movie was beautiful i loved the beach but the destinies were a little creepy to me they glow when say future? how weird! but still great movie.I'm 8 years old hope this helps."
5,kids love it!,My 4 year old is a huge Barbie fan and this is her favorite Barbie movie so far. She would watch this every day if I let her. My 2 year old boy/girl twins also enjoy it. They all get up and dance at the Queen of the Waves song and surf along with Barbie whenever she is riding the waves. My daughter won't watch Disney movies because of the scary character found in them and I like that the Barbie movies (or the ones we have) don't have a scary character. This is a great Barbie movie that I don't mind watching.
2,Barbie Movie,Barbie in a Mermaid TaleOne of the BestI liked the Names they were differnetThe Queen was Beautiul and I liked the actors
1,Horrible!!,If you are a fan of the fairytales- i.e. Rapunzel/Nutcracker/Swan Lake (Barbie in her Golden Age movies) you won't like this one. Don't want my daughter to watch anymore either.
1,BLECH,"Weak story, stupid characters, poor animation. The worst yet. Go back to princess movies, Barbie! If I could I'd give this -5 stars! I want my money back!"
1,boring and lame story,We own all the Barbie movies and this one was right up there with Thumbelina. It had a short and weak story. Doesn't even compare to The Diamond Castle or Three Musketeers.
3,Standing Fan,"Deco Breeze has such beautiful fans that I decided to get one for my living area. I decided on this fan because it is adjustable and can be used as a standing fan or a table fan. It does not arrive ready to use and was not easy to put together. It took me quite a while to do so. The Deco Breeze emblem was dented and I do not think the way the head attaches to the pole is well designed. A word to the wise, the set screw that holds the blades in place must really be torqued down to secure it well. It squeaks at one end of its oscillation and that is annoying, however, it creates a terrific breeze even on low and is capable of cooling a large area. I would not buy this particular fan again, but, for the price, I believe I got what I paid for and it has worked well."
3,beautiful but noisy,"This is a beautiful fan that seems sturdy and creates a lot of air movement. However, for use in our living room where we watch television, it was way too noisy, even at the lowest speed. I should have been forewarned by reviews that said it created good white noise. Be aware also that it is quite heavy and takes up a bit of room. My husband is a retired electronics engineer, and he says if it had five curved blades instead of four straight ones, it would have provided plenty of air at a lower speed. We regretfully returned it (Amazon makes it fairly easy). I subsequently happened across and purchased a lovely Hawaiian Breeze brand, 5-blade, quiet, 12"" table fan in a beautiful pewter finish, at Wal-Mart for $32. For someone who has a large room where noise is not a problem, the Deco Breeze fan would add a work of art to your room."
1,Very LOUD,"The fan is very loud makes a humming roaring sound, not a normal fan sound. It woke me up at 4am this morning. I unplugged the fan and put my old one back."
4,Great representation of the Community,"This book is great for K-3. You could expand the curriculum for older children easily. The book uses the alphabet to teach children about community helpers. Each letter is for a different community helper, and the letter Y stands for You! This book draws the reader in and creates an environment where they can better understand every person in their community. This understanding translates to respect for everyone and the knowledge that every helper is indispensable."
1,losing lines of text too fast,"This dictionary is not very sophisticated, but I can live with that. However it lost a line of pixels within the first few months of use, and now has lost three lines making it almost unreadable! It is not more than a year or so old. Buy another brand!"
3,"Ok, but did not receive the model I ordered","I did not receive the exact model I ordered, but an older one, which is a English dictionary with a translator extension card. Product is ok. Screen is something hard to read since not backlighted."
3,Merthi beaucoup!,"Purchathing a Franklin BFQ-450 Larouththe French/Englith Dicthionary has tholved a life-long problem for me. I have alwayth believed that I wath born tongue-tied and tho have not been able to lead a normal life. Onthe I thtarted uthing the Larouththe French/Englith Dicthionary I thuddenly realized that being tongue-tied wath not my problem at all, rather, I now know that the French language ith my native tongue; no pun intended. At leatht the French thounded tongue-tied to me during my thtay in Proventhe. Merthi beaucoup!"
5,Amazing tool for learning french,"I use this to do french homework, reading french books, translating random words. I bring it everywhere with me. I can say that its great to learn the language.Note: Put the resolution up so that you can see more text."
3,"French/English Dictionary is comme-ci, comme, ca.",This hand-held dictionary is okay. The font/print is not bold enough and the back lighting is too weak making it difficult to read in well-lit spaces. I like the sentences that illustrate the definitions. If I had it to do over I would get a more up-to-date model(if one exists) with the quality of today's computers. I am disappointed with this product.
1,not a good investment,If you really want a French dictionary device (en lieu d'un dictionnaire en papier) this is not it. Missing a lot of words and some definitions incorrect. I have a program on my laptop (Collins) which is much better. Look for other options.
5,Another Donnie to love...I am on cloud 9,"Well, my love for Donny Hathaway is what caused my love for Cloud 9. This is an impressive debut. Neo-soul is a term that aggravates me greatly, soul is soul, period. Yes, there's some Hathaway, some Stevie, maybe even a touch of George Benson in there, too? I like every song on this cd. Why, oh why, aren't artists of this caliber promoted properly? I'm tired of the bling, the pretentiousness and the lack of talent these days and I'm sure there are those of you who would agree. This album is like something forgotten from the 70's. It's light and sunshine on some tracks, and heavy-hitting and damn clever on others. This record is like life: you can hear the joy, the sorrow, the blood, the earth, the horror. It's a rare recording that moves me so. Word of mouth sells records these days, not mtv, BET, or vh1. So start talking, this one's absolutely wonderful."
5,2 Thumbs Up!,Some of his songs remind me of D'Angelo...not a bad thing just thought I would mention it. But I really do enjoy this album. It's a sleeper and I've been telling everyone about it so I hope word of mouth helps. This one will not disappoint.
5,Donnie 's groove,"This is too awesome I keep it in heavy rotation. My favorites are Cloud 9, Rocketship and Do you know. The brother is a true artist."
2,"yea, .......... i don't know .......",i heard that this guy sounds just like stevie wonder and like donny hathaway. donnie's website describes him in this way as well. i think a true artist should sound just like him or herself. the songs are cool but the source is so much better.
4,Donnie's the man,"I love Donnie, let it be known. I have seen him live and he is one of the best performers out there at the moment, so INTENSE. The only reason I didn't give him 5 stars was that the album did drag a bit at times. I love ""Do You Know"", it could have easily been written by Stevie Wonder. Go get it!"
5,AN EXCELLENT WAKE-UP CALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The colored Section is and will always be the new wake-up call for the youth of today. Now is the time for them to listen.I only wish I could have given him more than 5 stars for his excellent portrayal of what is going on in the world today.Thank you Donnie for you voice and your inspiration. I can't wait until your next endever.With much love and respect.......Andrilia Sutton-Harding (Brookhaven,PA)"
3,the most stevie-ish of the stevie-wannabees...,"throw-back jerseys are all the rage...i mean, i love this guy's talent... as far as what's out there, musically, this is arie's twin brother...70's soul music remains my favorite... i dip into it on a daily basis/it's fundamental for me...if i want a stevie wonder record, however, i just go out and get it... this is no dis to brother donnie, it's jus that the production is SOOOO AUTHENTIC-SOUNDING in comparison to vintage stevie wonder, that the lyrics dont hold up as well...i love what he is saying: bold stuff that is badly missing from today's rhythm and blues material... i love the production... they jus dont match up well anuff for me...honestly, this will hafta grow on me (and aint nothin wrong with that... i'm willing to wait.)"
4,Intelligent Soul - kicking band,"A review @ SeeingBlack.com was where I read it listed as one of the best 2002 releases. They were right! At first hear, must read lyrics to get the full effect of this man's gifts. Pleasantly surprised to be welcomed to the ""Colored Section."" It reminds me of listening party days. Remember those? This release brilliantly broadens scope for the head and heart. Touches on sensitive issues many have forgotten..has some phrases that can become anthems which I connect with..""I'm not a nigga but a nig-aro, when I become a nigga I'll let you know""...""I'm happy to be nappy, I'm black and I'm proud""....Hello !! He holds his own with lyrics and style on the waves of Hathaway, Mayfield, Wonder and RaShawn Patterson. Add it to your library and see for yourself !"
5,Donnie Colored Section,Excellent!! Mainstream radio may not be ready for this artist. He tells the truth.
5,Beautiful...,"This album is amazing! While I agree with some reviewers that ""neo-soul"" appears to be getting trite and unoriginal, I beg to differ with Donnie. Every song on the album is beautiful and clear. The clarity, that is, is in the message that is both unapologetic and prideful. Some neosoul artists speak in code-- he doesn't. His voice is real and so is his message! I cannot wait to hear more from him and to see his star continue to rise!"
3,Pretty Good Debut Album,"I dig what Donnie is saying on His Album,but I think the Production&His Vocals aren't allowed much room to flow.He has a strong message&I can relate fully to what he is bringing&it's a welcome to what goes for lyrical Content on most albums nowadays.I bet within a Album or two Donnie might be unstoppable.with the way he comes out Here a album or two later things should get real interesting.Keep a ear on this Cat."
2,great idea but full of borrowed chords and ad-libs .......,"i am a lifelong fan of stevie wonder and donny hathaway. as much as i love everyone's musical reference to these two soul icons (in the recent genre of neo-classical soul), it drives me crazy when i hear exact riffs, chords and song concepts borrowed from their songs: big black buck - stevie's ebony eyes, you got a friend - donny's you got a friend, turn around - donny and roberta's back together again etc....... then there's the whole name issue. i think donnie is talented and i enjoy his musicality but jazz has taught us that you can take a take a great standard and re-interpret it a million ways if you create something new and induvidual, when you borrow too much it starts to sound like something else or even something stolen. great effort but doesn't this album sound like something else?"
3,Wish he further.... and where is he now,"This is cool , i wish Donnie would have went further like his uncle Marvin Gaye, anyone who has not heard this album , take a listen , it's cool... I give it a 10 and 5 stars"
2,good ..... but doesn't it sound like something else?,donnie certainly has learned from the greats .... stevie wonder and donny hathaway ..... but there is a sense of .... haven't i heard those chords .... that riff .... on a stevie album ... or was it a donny hathaway cut.... the neo-soul movement won't stand for anything real until it embraces induviduality ... forget imitation ... we know the real thing when stevie and donny did it so uniquely...... a great tribute to the forefathers of soul but .... haven't i heard that somewhere before?
3,BLACK & PROUD,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM, PLEASE BELIEVE. ALL THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE THIS BROTHA DOES HAVE THE STEVIE WONDER TOUCH AND HE REPS IT RIGHT. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS ALBUM JUST 3 STARS IS BECAUSE HE IS VERY POLITICAL IN THE PRO BLACK MESSAGE, WHICH I AM ALL FOR, I AM A NEO SOUL AFRO CENTRIC NAPPY HAIR SISTAH MYSELF. I JUST THINK HE WOULD REACH A LARGER AUDIENCE WITH A LITTLE MORE SUGAR W/T THIS HARD TO SWALLOW TRUTH ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. PLUS WITH EVERY SONG FOCUSING ON THE BLACK MOVEMENT AND DOWNFALLS, IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW WELL DOES HE WRITE CREATIVLY ON OTHER SUBJECTS, THATS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND STEVIE, STEVIE WROTE ABOUT EVERYTHING, AND DIDN'T STAMP IT W/T ""BLACK"" EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW SOMETIMES THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BLACK EXPERIENCE. ALL IN ALL THIS IS A TREMENDOUS EFFORT FOR A DEBUT ALBUM, AND I HOPE TO SEE MORE DONNIE IN THE FUTURE.STAY BLACK AND PROUD!"
5,Donnie Wonder?,"I was introduced to this artist by a friend who played a couple of songs for me over the telephone. That day I purchased this CD to add to my music collection. I absolutely love track 3 (Cloud) and track 10 (Heaven Sent). To me Donnie's style is similar to Stevie Wonder although I can see the reference to Hathaway and Gaye as well.It's funny how I had never heard of Donnie and yet I had heard of Donnie and didn't know it. When I repeatedly listened to ""Cloud"" I kept asking myself where had I heard that song before? Then I was watching the movie ""Brown Sugar"" for the umpteenth time and the song was playing in the background for the New Year's Party scene. If you like the soulfulness of Wonder, Hathway and Gaye then I highly suggest adding this CD to your music collection."
5,Welcome back to the Seventies for real!!!,"I have waited patiently for this release from the first time I heard ""Do You Know"" on a jazz station out of London. When I first heard the song, I wondered, whether it was Stevie or is it something unreleased from Donny Hathaway. Needless to say, I am thrilled to add this new classic to my collection. Enjoy!"
2,Doesn't quite fit my bike,"This rack works great, except that the eyelet connectors are bigger than other racks. This covers the second set of eyelets on the frame so I can't put fenders on. Might work on your bike, might not. Won't work if your bike is a Redline Conquest Classic."
5,Great Product / Easy Install,"Its construction is excellent, and the quality of the materials superb. Installation was a breeze, and it feels very sturdy on the bike. Great product! Highly recommend it."
3,sturdy but kind of a pain...,"These are awesome for regular bikes, but fitting one to my 29er was a challenge. I managed though, but had to use longer screws. Almost too small for the bike, but once I got it on it's fine.Otherwise, no complaints..."
1,Check width first,"The bottom rear of my bike frame where a rack attaches is 6 inches wide, so I emailed Topeak's outsourced customer support to see if this would fit. They said it should fit. When I received it, I found that it was 4 inches wide at the bottom connection points and could not fit. Topeak's customer support did not even know what the actual width was, just that ""it fits most disc bikes"". I've returned it to Bikesource; they've been fine."
2,Iron Horse Disc Brake Bike Owner,I own an Iron Horse Warrior series bicycle. This bike rake will not fit on that line of bikes. The squarish threaded hole in on the bike rake does not fit in the space allowed on a Iron Horse Warrior bike. Find your disc brake bike rack somewhere else. Other companies make compatible bike racks.
3,Did Not Fit,Could not get this rack to allign properly with the fork end eyelets. I have a 2010 Cannondale F4 hard tail Mtn Bike. Note the wide spacers at the tip of the rack support tubes. These spacers are apparently suppose to insure the rack support tubes clear the disc brake assembly. These spacers are way to large to sit snugly into the bicycle frame fork end eyelet seat and hence align up with the eyelets. I returned this rack for the standard Topeak `non-disc' model which was a bit tricky to initially line up with the eyelets but has worked out very well. The rear disc brake on my bike does not flair out from the seat stay or chain stay and does not get in the way of a standard rack.
5,It works!,"I bought this rack for a Marin Alpine 29er. It was a tight fit that required cutting the brackets so that they did not hit the back tire, but it fit and does what I wanted it to do."
3,For 37 USD it's really OK,"I had to file a lot of the metal off the rack mounts to adapt it to my disk break mounts. Hard work and I'm not sure if this is safe over the long run.Look at your disk break mounts. The mounts that you plan to use mustn't have anything around the hole in a 1cm radius. The bike rack has roughfly 1,5cm3 square blocks that need to have enough room to stick to the surface of the bike's mount.Pros: Sturdy Lightweight secures the toppeak BasketTopeak Wire Baskets Easy install if it fits your bike.Cons: Does not fit all disk breaks mounts (not my K2 Bike)"
5,Good book,"It's an interesting book. The only problem I have with this book is the husband. He's not a chess player, know little about chess but spoke like a big shot. The part about Zsuzsa is very good."
1,too small,no enough room for anything the clip keeps pupping open very unsatisfactory for the cost of the product extremely over priced
3,A nice electro dance cover from the voice of SOFT CELL,"While not quite as brilliant as the SUPERPITCHER remake from two years ago, this new T-TOTAL version of the classic ENO glam-rock anthem (itself featured in VELVET GOLDMINE) does the trick on the dancefloor, aided strongly by MARC ALMOND's instantly recognizable warble from SOFT CELL - in fact, Marc's vocal arrangement adds note that weren't in the book before - it reminds you how we need another new SOFT CELL album, too!"
4,"I don't go for the New Rockabilly much, but-",This guy is fantastic! I have a lot of lod time Rockabilly and this is the only new time type I have!
