2,Gran Turismo 3 [],When I Bought This Game I Thought I Would Be Playing It For Hours But It Turned Out That This GAme Is BORING. The Graphics And Sound Of This Game Is The Only Thing Good. My Advice: Rent It Before U Buy It.Gameplay: 1 Sound: 5 Graphics: 10++
2,The Ultimate Racing Game,"Grand Turismo is the best racing game on earth. The cars are exactly like the real thing. The reflections onto the car are very realistic as if you were driving it for real. The creators of the game made the speed, handling, acceleration and braking exactly as it would be in real life. they have millions of cars in the game like my pesonal favorite the viper GTS. like the first one the drivers test part is complicated. This time there is a line for the drivers test part that tells you what to do with the diferent coloring of the line. They have these new tracks for of road races. The tracks are somewhat complicated yet fun. So if you're a racing game freak then you'll love this game."
5,WOW!,"Crazy Game! Awsome graphics. real cars. actual prices. Man, when I hit 1500mph with the Suzuki Escudo Rally car, i freaked out. Best game on the market right now"
2,Overhyped,"This is a very good driving game, but it's way overhyped. All the cars drive pretty much alike, and the competition is laughable even (probably especially) for teenage gamers. The graphics is superb, but after the initial awe you'll just find the scenes cartoon-like at times. Car physics model is good but not as authentic as the truly realistic model in NASCAR 4 (for PC). The music tracks suck big time. Give us some real music, not stuff imported from Africa!"
2,It's ok,"This game is ok the cars look real but they make it to hard...The cars [stink] it has the worst view, If you want a awsome raceing game stick with Nascar Thunder 2002..."
4,Got to have it!!,"Gran Turismo!!I have waited for this game for two years and never understood why people were giving a four-star rating, well I bought the game today and now I understand,this game does have great graphics,but the cars look cartoonish,Almost Nintendo like, but not quite that bad!!!I love to Race, My motto is Eat Race Die!!And Ive always and still will be a fan of this game!!But I have to say Gran Turismo 2 throws some serious comp with Part 3,My wife thinks part 2 is better,but for 49.95 Ihave to tell her 3 is better so shes not so upset!For some reason 3 looks slower,the cars dont look as fast,in the replay mode and thats really bad!!Cuz the feel of the speed needs to be there!!Hopefully when I get the Faster cars this will be put to rest!!"
1,Horrible,"This game is really realistic! Yeah, but so would a dishwashing simulation. Analysis: I don't really give a crap about taking each corner perfectly, and braking so that I get the perfect amount of speed. I don't like how my car can't turn with a crap, even if that is how it really is. I don't care. I play games for fun, not for realism. You know what's real? Go outside and play lacrosse or join a street racing team. I don't want my video games THIS real."
3,Very Kewl Game,"This was one of my first games I bought for PS2. It is cool, but I lost interest in it quick. Probably because I can't even do Lisense test A (Ha! Ha!). Don't get me wrong, It's a very cool game, with awesome effects, car detail, CARS, tracks, and features, but I just am not interested in it anymore!"
3,overrated,"Gran Turismo was truly something phenomenal when it began on the original Playstation. Now, on the Playstation 2, I think it's time to end the Gran Turismo series. The game isn't BAD at all. It's just ordinary racing.I think too much emphasis was put on realism and not enough on simply having fun. Every car looks spectacular but they all feel exactly the same. I find myself daydreaming while racing because, honestly, looking at good graphics all the time can only be interesting until the next updated racing title comes out, and then all eyes are focused on THAT game.I think I know why so many people are selling Gran Turismo for such a cheap price. It's average."
5,Most realistic racing game on the market!!!!!!!,"The game is awesome. There are Porsches in the game as well as a Lambourghini. I'm not dissing the game, but I would like to see some additions to the game. Being able to have a custom paint job, or putting body accessories would be cool. Another addition would be another type of racing. There is light-weight racing, F-1, and rally on this game. I think putting a street racing type of race would be awesome. The Tokyo tracks are not enough to give this experience. I'll be looking forward to an awesome sequel."
4,"Great game, but it's missing GREAT CARS!!!","Ok, first it's great, there are alot of improvements from the last 2 games. It's easier to tune your car! You have traction control, which is good if you like that kind of thing (I don't), great graphics blah blah blah...Oh, and thankfully the license tests are easier and the naviagation is alot easier when you're buying a car from the second one.Ok the bad, NO USED CARS! Which is a real pooper. I had to start out with a Miata, I hate those cars. Second, you guys remember the really cool hot rides and classics like the 69' Covette Stingray, the Charger, and the other...cars? YOU DON'T GET THEM! I WANT MY STINGRAY!!! I loved it. And by the way, I'd rather race one of those than some stupid exotic sports cars, those things are just average to me. Oh well. Buy it used don't pay full price. But if you can't wait you'll like it anyway. And if you aren't used to traction control turn it off!!!"
5,The best racing game you'll ever find,"what else can i say, there isan't a better racing game out there than GT3, this game is like the king of racing video games, you just have play it to belive it, and trust me, your well not be disappointed."
4,The best game ever,"IT's very fun.The good thing is that u can put turbo kits on the car like in real life.For example i bought a corvette for 40,000 dollars and it went 160mph then i put 70,000 dollars in to it and now it gos 213mph.It's also only $20."
4,"Good, but nothing great.","It offers a wide array of cars, but lacks some of the best ie Ferrari, Porsche, and Lambroghini. The tracks are limitless and offer awesome scenery, but I can't get over they didn't even have Porsches. I recommend this to anyone who has a lot of time, it will take most of your spare time to beat this game."
2,Flawed car control algorithms.,"Bad:Way too many button pushes to cancel the endless replays.Worse:Cars do not properly respond to throttle inputs. Sure they speed up and slow down, but sideways drift cannot be initiated to slide the car to the proper line around a corner. Real racing involves pointing the car at the curb then using the gas pedal to just force the car out from the curb. Throttle input with this game actually does the opposite, and tightens the corner. Drifting wide in real car? just lift the throttle a little and car comes closer to the apex. Not so here, drifts are impossible to stop without the brake pedal."
2,This Game STINKS!,"I've heard many opinions about GT3. One day my friend brought it over so that we could play it on my PS2. It wasn't very fun at all! First off, it's so hard to turn your car you keep crashing. Secondly, it's boring! There is hardly anything interesting about the tracks. I would not recommend this game. I don't know why people like it."
2,"OK, but not that great",This game is very challenging. Although the cars are very realistic and the graphics are elxellent the gameplay is very challenging. There are many cars but its hard to control. Only get this game if its really inexpensive.
3,I don't like cars but this game is fun,for a racing game it is actually pretty cool I don't like cars but if I did this game would get a 5 the licences are a little hard to get on it though but overall this is a fun game
1,gt3 not that fun to play,the cars in this game are impossible to control!!!!the game is overrated. too boring to play with a really bad soundtrak.don't buy this game.
1,GT2 got boring,So does this. It is ridiculous. Like the other person who says GT2 and the original (which I only have a demo of) get boring is right. This game is only fun for about only 1 min and the licenses are TOO HARD! TOO HARD! Well don't buy it it is dreadful. Garbage controls. rubbish handling and very hard races and less cars and only a few more tracks makes this game a real loser. F355 challenge is another PS2 game I own. and that is very very good. Sony why did you release GT3 it is....... DREADFUL!
2,Just ok.Don't buy!,"This game is just ok.It is fun when you have allot of money.But at the beging it's a waste of money.Don't waste your money!I made a mistake in buying this game!Don't buy this game.Here are some good games:max payne,ratchet and clank 1 and 2,ncaa2004,Madden is good to."
1,What a crappy game,"I was not at all impressed with GT3. I'll admit that the graphics are pretty good, but the gameplay stinks! There are way too many cars, and so little levels. I had the game for 1 day and I already wanted to return it. The handling is also extremely horrible. Every time a played it I wanted to put a frickin' axe straight through the TV! This game is just a big copy of GT2, and that's all. And if any of the creators are watching this, try making better games!"
5,One of the most realistic racing games ever produced,"Gran Turismo 3 is currently the leader in the racing genre when it comes to realism. There are nearly 200 brand name cars available to race and modify, the graphics contain an astounding amount of detail, and even the soundtrack is great (well, mostly). In the simulation mode, there are enough options to satisfy any gear head, and an arcade mode is included for those who just want to get right into the game without having to deal with all of the technicalities. My only gripe with GT3 is the same problem I've had ever since it's first incarnation...the license tests. While it could be argued that they add to the overall realism factor, they will frustrate many players who want to complete every race in simulation mode. Despite that hurdle, GT3 is a racing game that anyone can enjoy (if you can't tolerate the license tests, there's always the arcade mode after all). If you are a racing fan and own a Playstation 2, Gran Turismo 3 is a must buy."
5,BEST RACING GAME EVER!!!!,"I JUST GOT THE GAME TODAY AND... THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME IN ITS GENRE. THE GRAPHICS ARE SO MUCH IMPROVED FROM THE 1ST 2 GRAN TURISMOS, U CAN SEE GREAT DETAILS OF THE CARS AND THE BACKGROUND IS GREAT.IF U LIKED THE 1ST 2 GRAN TURISMOS U WILL CERTAINLY LOVE THIS GAME. I DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEONE COULD OWN A PLAYSTATION 2 WITH OUT OWNING THIS GAME. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANY RACING GAME FAN, ACTUALLY THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANY KIND OF GAMER!!"
5,"So far, CAN'T BEAT IT!","Great, great, great. If you want the most fun and realistic race driving simulator out there, this is it. Controls feel similar to GT2. Graphics are light years beyond any other racing game available now. Replays look like the real thing with sun rays coming thru trees, heat rising, fog, heavy dirty smoke rising from rally races, gets you into the action in a big way! If you liked GT and GT2, GET IT ASAP! Even if it's the only game you have on the PS2, it'll keep you busy for a while. Don't miss out on all the fun!"
4,Keeps getting better.,This is a fun game. If you've been following the Gran Turismo series you'll be impressed with this new version. The cars are amazing and the graphic details is brilliant. The soundtrack could use a little work but it's not too bad. This game is great for all ages.
5,Grand Turismo 3 Review (JAP version),"This review is being written only one day after purchasing a JAP PS2 plus a copy of the game. I took the machine out of the box, inserted the CD, turned it on and just watched.....and I watched, and I watched. WOW!! - at last a video game that lives up to my expectations. An intro that will leave your jaw on the floor. Until you realise that the intro is actually in game footage. Okay, so I have only played the game for around 5 hours but it is absolutely superb. I'm not going to say anything more as I am off home to play it some more (before I pop to the pub anyway). Buy it as soon as it hits the shelves & enjoy !!"
3,harder than expected,I got my yoga dvd today and sat down to view it. I have not done yoga before so need something for beginners. after watching it I have a hard time believing this is a beginners tape. it is long and hard. it will take me forever to get this learned. if you are a beginner I suggest you keep looking.
5,I Love this video!!,"I have never done Yoga in my life. I had considered on a couple occasions joining a Yoga class, but decided I would rather learn a little in the privacy of my home first. I am so glad I bought this DVD. After the first time doing it, I already loved it! For an absolute beginner like me, some of the positions are a little difficult to hold for any amount of time. But there is no problem in following along and understanding what you should be doing. I found Alan Finger to be a wonderful instructor. He explains the positions very well and always stresses to make sure you are breathing. His voice is very calming, which helped me remain relaxed throughout the video. After doing this video, I feel completely relaxed! I really think this a great choice for a beginner! I also purchased the Yoga Zone Conditioning and Stess Relief DVD along with this one and am looking very forward to trying that one too!"
4,Good video for yoga beginner's,"I found this video good for a yoga beginner. There different people doing different poses for the beginner and intermediate levels of yoga. The instructor explains the movements in an easy to understand manner. He gives ideas to help your body ""ease"" into yoga. Good video."
4,Good Starter Tape,"This was my first venture into yoga so I was not sure what to expect. I found the production quality a bit cheesy, however, the instruction is simple and informative. The reminders to inhale and exhale throughout the tape were very helpful for me. I am happy with my purchase and would buy other tapes in this series"
4,"Good Intro to Yoga, but Boring","Although I found this video to be just about the most boring excercise video I've ever used, I think it is actually very good for beginners. All of the poses are explained clearly and slowly, with suggestions for adaptations due to weak knees, etc. If you can manage to get through a long boring hour, and stick with it, this video will really help you learn some basic yoga. Not to mention that you'll feel great."
5,I love this video,"I had purchased the VHS and now I own the DVD, I was doing this video often and stopped a while. Then today I put did it again and I feel so wonderful. My entire body has been stretched out and I worked up a little sweat as well. Alan Finger explains in detail what to do, how you should be feeling and how and when to breath in and out. As a beginner, I truly appreciate his way of teaching Yoga. I've tried other yoga tapes and honestly they don't compare. You cannot know if you're doing it right in most cases. Even other beginner tapes are not as clear as Alan Finger, and some of them make you try dangerous poses, well not this one. You can be very out of shape and do this one. You only go as far into the poses as you can go, and he tells you so the whole way through. I don't feel i'd ever need another tape after this one, but then again I'm still a beginner."
3,Why priced so high?,Why is this item priced at $149? I thought it was a mistake when I first saw it. This sheet of stamps can be purchased at hundreds of places for face value or a little more.
5,The best book I have ever read,"This book is for anyone who belives in GUN Rights. While it is fiction, it also has many truths about what has happened to our Rights over the years. I would highly recomend it to all that think the goverment has too much control over our lives."
5,Unintended Consequences,"Excellent read, the story is well developed, well written and believable. A must read."
4,This book should piss you off!,"Excellent book. I read the entire 800+ page tome in about a week.Though not perfect, it is an obviously well researched and passionate work. I couldn't believe some of what I was reading, so I looked up some of the more lurid episodes given in the book. -All appeared to be accurate and very very scary.If you care at all about government abuse of power, and the US becoming a police state. Read this book. If you don't believe this is happening in America - read this book.Though I would not rate it with Atlas Shrugged, it is a good companion to AS. Rand's work contained abstract principles. This book gives concrete examples of what Ms. Rand was talking about. The two together should convince anyone with intellectual honesty that what Rand feared is coming to pass."
5,Thought provoking and deeply disturbing,"This book is powerful in the emotions it evokes and the images it portrays. No one who reads this book will have a neutral reaction to it. It's view of governmental power abuses is disturbing. This book essentially maintains that absolute power corrupts absolutely, so the People of the USA need to make sure that absolute power does not accumulate to anybody. If this book had a motto it would be ""Eternal Vigilance is the price of liberty.""There are several story sub plots and some of the sexual imagery is unnecessary. This is not a book recommended for early teen readers."
5,One of John Ross's best novels,This is a well researched & written story. It gripes you right from the start and keeps you on the edge till the last page. Not many books have kept me reading page after page just to see what was comming next. A good book for when you have plenty of time to finish it because you will not want to put it down. Well worth the time & price.Unintended Consequences
5,A Must Read Book,"TEN STARS. This book is a warning on the level of Orwell's 1984. Happily the trends predicted in the book have cooled since it was published, but they could reverse and get worse at any time. If you work for a government agency, you must read this book. If you have ever felt screwed by a government bureaucracy, this book may help you heal. We ignore the warnings in this book at considerable peril to our society and to ourselves."
3,yes and no,"This book has good parts, especially the historical sections, and I am in general agreement with the author about the dangers of the anti-gun extremists, but the bad parts knocked a couple off stars of my rating. First of all, it is too long; a good editor would have been able to trim it without losing anything important. Second, the technical sections went over my head for the most part. Perhaps some illustrations showing what was being done would have helped. Third, the sexual morals (or rather, the lack thereof) of the leading characters were deplorable. Fourth, the violence was TOO graphic! Yes, being shot does cause a lot of damage to the human body, but are nightmare-inducing descriptions of it really necessary? Fifth, the glorification of vigilantism was a real turn-off; self-defense is one thing, but cold-blooded murder is always unacceptable. Sixth, the ending was lame."
3,Where was the editor?,"This could have been a very good book. It is well-plotted and well-written,but it is interminably long. The author writes a comprehensive biography of practically every character in the book, giving detailed accounts of actions that occur decades before the events of the main plot and which turn out to have little or no bearing on the story. Mr. Ross knows how to write interesting and realistic scenes, but needs to be reined in. A pity,since the book makes some important points about the tendency of our government to slide toward tyranny. I doubt if many people will expend the effort required to read it."
3,Unintended Consequences,This novel is one of those hard to put down books. The thing that bothers me about it is the bad language and the graphic dipictions of the sexual exploits. Other than that it's very interesting how our rights are being slowly whittled away.
3,"Interesting read, but....","Very odd book. I have to admit I had a hard time putting it down once I started it. Having finished it, I feel that it made many good points about eroding personal freedoms. The part that bothered me is that the main character (Henery) lacked any introspection. If Henery would doubt (just once) his ""right"" to blow peoples heads off, I would have found it more plausable. The real world is more grey than the black and white world in ""UC"". I would recommend the book with a disclaimer."
4,"A good, but lengthy read.","A good book on a vitally important subject. Check the pulse of any politician or federal employee not shaken after reading this book. Years in the future, this book will probably be compared to Tom Paines' ""Common Sense"". The writing is now on the wall. Will the real Henry Bowmans please stand up."
4,Excellent if somewhat overworked,"Wow! If this book had been written more tightly, it would be a 10. As it is, it's important enough that you should read it. The long-winded discussion of specific guns and the history of certain firearms is boring after a while, even for a gun-nut like myself.If this book was maybe half as long, it would be great!"
5,possibly the best book I've read,"It's big, it's long, and it's heavy. However, there's not a moment in the book I didn't find myself to be immersed in the story and it's characters. The real life detail, the character development, the plot and character building were above and beyond anything I had expected for this book which was given as a book to me on my birthday. The historical facts is one facet of the book I find very intreaguing and something I have not experienced in other books I've read. This book will keep you reading!"
5,"Amazing, Exciting and Revolutionary!",This one of the best books I have ever read. Thoughtful insightful fiction based wholly on factual information. I'll be sitting right there with you Henry!
3,wish it were purely fiction!,"I wonder what the families of the Littleton Colorado massacre would say of MR. Ross's book. Is the right to own guns ""God given"", I think not. Jesus didn't walk the planet with a gun, nor do we need to. I do not want to take away the rights of the gun owners, however, I am scared to be at the mall or other crowed place now, for fear that a trouble person, who happens to have access to a law abiding persons guns has chosen to go on a killing spree! Isn't it time that we put our personal rights aside for the good of all men. Mr. Ross's book couldn't be any better written. IT is a good book, however, I sincerely wish it were science fiction than prophetic!"
2,For real troopers only,"If you can navigate through this 1,000-pound book, you're a better man than I. You'll encounter jargon galore about shooting and be encumbered with details that only serve to slow down the book's tortoise-paced plot. The book's views on liberty and freedom are worth reading, but I wasn't able to digest this format. Sorry."
1,"Great ideas, bad novel","I agree with the principles that Ross shouts throughout this book, but I can't get past his lack of literary skill. From reading the reviews, I gather that people who enjoy the gun culture forgive the amateur writing. But those who come looking for another Atlas Shrugged had better look elsewhere. Unlike Ayn Rand, Ross won't win over new converts. He simply amuses those who think like him."
5,One of the most significant books I have ever read,"While I don't normally have time to read works of fiction, I made an exception in this case due to the other reviews I've read. It was well worth the time. I have bought copies for my friends. This book is both entertaining and educational. You will certainly stay up nights reading it. The blending of fiction and reality is actually done quite skillfully. The focused eye that this book casts on our current government makes this as frightening as any Steven King novel."
5,"Personal Responsibility can be ""Politically Correct""","As a member of the ""gun culture"" and citizen of the USA, I couldn't help but like this work. It embraces the virtues of personal responsibility....I find this most welcome and refreshing. Ross' plot is thoughtful, entertaining, and often frightening. Its lessons are worth remembering, and its themes are worth sharing."
5,WOW!,"Take the very best of Ayn Rand, mix with twenty percent of Thomas Jefferson forthat texture of realpolitik, add a dash of Harold Robbins to give it that spicy,sexy seasoning, then wrap it all in the very best Tom Clancy style and cook inthe slow heat of word of mouth advertising on the internet. You have a novelthat becomes a runaway best seller and changes the way that a country thinks.Congratulations to Mr. Ross for writing what may be the best novel I have everread, and I am a voracious reader."
5,Definitely a Must-Read,"Well, I finished it, and if anything, it got better. One ofthose too-rare experiences of getting so caught up in a bookthat you almost mourn when it's over. Truly thought-provoking.The gun culture and the ""control"" culture may be on a real collisioncourse in America. Anyone who wants to understand the clashof cultures better should read Unintended Consequences. Rossis also quite a fine novelist, quite apart from his command ofthe subject matter. UC is a real page-turner, with excellentplotting, pacing, and character development. I would havehappily read another 850 pages!"
3,"Nice story, but questionable in content...","The book is written well, and the story is very interesting. In no way is it not an interesting read (although it is over 800 pages long). The content seems a bit too outrageous, however. Too ""anti-government"" for comfort. Support for guns is one issue, but portraying the government so negatively seems to be wholly another concern. The author could have given government law enforcement a little bit more respect."
3,Wish Fulfillment?,"I just read John Ross's book ""Unintended Consequences"". After all the positive comments, I wanted to find out for myself if it was really as good as readers reviews claimed it was.Here is my opinion:I found the book to be a combination of the writing style of Stephen Hunter (author of some excellent books on sniper culture) with some elements from ""The Turner Diaries"" (a book which described the overthrow of a zionist occupied US by patriots.) There were also the types of acts described typical to wish fulfillment fantasy novels. An o.k. book but certainly not the greatest work of fiction on this subject.I wonder if reviewers would think it was still a great book if the hero was homosexual instead of his girlfriend???"
2,Great Book but ....,"John Ross did a great job with the facts and history associated with guns in America within his story. It started off somewhat slow but picked up speed quickly. The use of facts to set the tone of the story ran the gamut of happiness, to sadness, and ultimately to anger. This book is a fascinating walk through America's history of gun ownership with an ending that is too plausable to think about.The only drawback to this story is John Ross' seemingly fascination with sex. Using whores, to the rape of a male, to group sex. I would not allow my child to read this book because of what he put into the story and sadly, put this in unnecessarily. John Ross went beyond the need to ""add"" spice to a story that would have better without the additives. Hence, the reason for two stars. If he would have left most of the filth out of the book, I would give it 5 stars. It is too bad that John Ross did not realize that his story was good enough to stand on its own without the garbage."
2,"Good intentions, unintended consequences","First off, I'd like to say that I am an avid gun enthusiast. That being said, I jumped into the (rather voluminous) pages of Unintended Consequences expecting an interesting and well-versed story about gun culture. What I got was a history lesson for about a quarter of the book, followed by some filler, which decided to devolve into masturbatory murder fantasy for the obvious Mary Sue character. The plot was somewhat enjoyable for around 300 pages, but completely stepped off the literary diving board after a few oddly placed rape scenes, involving both a female side-character and (strangely enough) the main character. And no, the main character in this case was not the perpetrator. Scenes include shooting helicoptors out of the sky via anti-tank rifles, mass explosions, and a ludicrous American insurgency scenario. The author, John Ross, is quite literally everything that America pictures as the typical ""gun nut"""
5,a 'frog being slowly boiled'...,"I am not sure what I expected when I started reading this HUGE book, but I came away with an education and a sharpened perspective. Unfortunately, I fear the book is too long for most people to read, and it contains some unnecessary sexual and violent content rendering it mostly unsuitable for use in schools.I grew up in the 'gun culture' here in Texas in the 60's and 70's, and while I was aware of the ever increasing federal encroachment on our rights, I am sad to say I was the 'frog being slowly boiled.' After reading Ross's book, I feel like I've been plucked out, cooled off and thrown back in!I recommend everyone over 21 read this book!"
3,Not A Nut Book,"Contrary to the listed review, this book does hit at the heart of the middle. The author uses a long time friend (in the book) who comes back to the US after 30 years abroad. The insights of that event were fantastic. This is not a how to but a real and true account of policies and politics. I am putting this book into my library with a reread note."
4,Justice raped and pillaged,"This is a frightful look into America's growing desire for more governmental control and homeland security. And America's appalling lack of education (and no, you can't blame Washington for it, either).This is a monstrous tome filled with all the pulp violence and kinky sex any good modern fiction should have. Federal agents who died in this story deserved it because they were stupid. And the author strays deftly away from glorifying imperical actions, civil rights violators are definitely the bad guys here.I was chilled with some of the rampid scenes of chaos, but I also laughed along with the author; his sense of irony is delightful, and I still feel warm and toasty inside after reading the finale.This is a fun book, if not too long and burdened with esoteric reams of technical gun jargon. And you're not a gun control freak afraid of all those dangerous firearms."
5,Outstanding Delivery of Promises Made Within,"Unintended Consequences tends to dispell the myth of gun nut conspiracy theorists, and, contrary to popular groupthink, gun control is *not* about safety, it's about the politics of the gun - Who gets to arm himself and who gets to negate it. The U.S. government has long been an egregious oppressor of lawful citizen activity and one need not be a member of the gun culture or a militia to see that. Take one long, wide eyed open look at history. Heck, start by reading this book. It's worth it."
5,A must-read for those still believing in the Bill of Rights,"John Ross combines a brilliant patchwork of historical vignettes concerning the importance of firearms in a free society with a fast-paced, modern-day story line. The most pages I've read in the shortest amount of time since Trinity. Infused throughout the story is a disturbing commentary on the consistent erosion of our individual liberties. I'd love to see a sequel."
3,"TOO LONG BY HALF, BUT A GOOD READ",THIS STUFF NEEDS TO BE SAID AND READ. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA DOESN'T WANT YOU TO READ IT YOU SHOULD.
1,Unintended Consequences,"Bad. No flow to the writing, jarring anecdotal excerpts. No developed plot or characters. Do not read this book, read Molon Labe instead."
1,You Are Known by the Company You Keep,"Those of you, and there seem to be many, who have endowed this book with five stars should be aware that Timothy McVeigh, the convicted Oklahoma City bomber, has embraced it totally, calling it his ""New Testament."" (See ""American Terrorist, Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing."") Perhaps you should be more careful whose ideas you choose to espouse. This book is the manifesto for every delusional paranoid who honestly believes the government is about to knock on his door and take away all his guns before enslaving him and selling his wife and daughters into white slavery. It was this very same set of delusions that led McVeigh to take the lives of 168 innocent people, including 19 babies, on that April morning in 1995. It sends shivers down my spine to know that Timothy McVeigh has so many kindred spirits out there, some of whom probably dream of carrying on his ""work."" View this book as the paranoid trash that it is."
5,A needed and important book,"This book is important enought that I have two copies, one to keep and one to lend. If you value a Constitutional Republic and the Constitution, read this book and then read it a second time. After reading it pass it on to somebody else to read. Heck, buy copies and give 'em as gifts, donations to libraries and schools and send one to your local ""we know better than you"" politician.The lessons in John's book do not just relate to the gun culture, they relate to everyone that has had to face unheeding hacks in dealing with governmenal agencies, local, state and federal."
4,Good for a 'V plater',"I enjoyed reading this book. Being Australian these ideas and thought's about American culture are new to me. It's the character's that irked me, they all sound like the fantasy's of a virgin. The sex scenes are like porno scence's and completely lack any reality. Henry Bowman is awsome at everything, after a while the character started to annoy me with his know-it-allism (you could just imagine Henry's arrogant smirk as he was spewing more of his retoric). But I give this book four stars because I did like it, I had never heard alternative views on Waco and so forth. Good job on the book Mr. Ross but now its time for you to go out and get layed..."
5,What does this book do for Amercians?,"Buried deep inside all the titillating sex and violence (and guns galore), there is a (hidden?) Guide for controlling our over-reaching goverment.It's no secret that using deadly force is the main feature of the guide (or plan).It's a more modern version of the plan used in Lexington, on April 19, 1775.The plan has many flaws. But at first glance, it seems like it would work pretty well.So, I'm sure that more than a few readers have come to the conclusion, that this book is beneficial to America, because just the existence of this 'plan' will inhibit goverment over-reach.I liked the book because I'm interested in long range rifle shooting, and it was very entertaining."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"A little long but other than that, it was great. The story line and how it unfolds is excellent. I just wish he'd write more books."
4,Never heard this in school,A very good book. The use of historical detail to demonstrate the issue of government abuse of power is compelling. Details of the Weaver case from this book were corroborated in other books I've read. I recommend this book to anyone who fancies themselves as thinkers.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and had a hard time putting it down. The characters are complex and developed. The history they are surrounded by is thoroughly researched and detailed. The ""Current Day"" section of the book was disturbing, yet the most realistic and probable start to any future 'Civil War' I have ever read.There were a couple of sections that dealt with rape or sexual issues that I felt were detailed a bit too much. I cannot fault the book though because every facet of the writing was detailed, complete and left me with vivid pictures in my head showing the story.I would definately recommend this book to anyone that feels the government is overstepping it's constitutional authority or to anyone that denies our government is heading down the path to tyranny."
4,An Important Lesson in How Freedom is being taken.,"August 20, 1999.I just finished Mr. Ross' book UC and have to say right away that it was one of the most educational docu-fictional books that I have ever read. How many of us can say we are ""that frog slowly boiling in the pot"", not realizing that our Freedoms are being chipped away little by little. If this book were allowed to be required reading in all high schools and colleges it would have a definite affect on this country. This book will never get the attention of a Stephen King or Tom Clancy novel even though it is written by a man from St. Louis who shows he has as much if not more writing ablility for his first novel! Mr. Ross, when you get tired of plinking, this country could still use your talent to bring more of these issues to the peoples attention with more great books like this one. Thanks!"
5,The Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance!,This is a GREAT book. A must read for every American. I'm going to send copies to my Representative and both Senators. It's about time we take back our God given right.
5,Save United States by reaching others.,If you have a friend give them a copy of this book and encourage them to read it. If you have too many friends to give them all a copy then just pick a few and ask them to read it and pass it on to others. America has a chance to survive its Socialist Leaders if we read this book and get others to read it. Besides it is the most fun and exciting read you have had the last 10 to 20 years so it is painless
5,Masterful,"I read a well-worn, borrowed copy of Ross's book.It features excellent story-telling, a keen insight into American culture, and an in-depth look at motivation behind events that impacted our civil rights. I find myself occasionally wondering, ""What would Henry Bowman do?""I can only hope Mr. Ross puts his book back into print in a larger run and also into Kindle format."
5,"Riveting, Fascinating and Educational","My hat is off to John Ross for a story that kept me glued to this book for days. Not only is it so entertaining that you can't put it down, it's also very educational. Ross's story is intertwined with the history of the American gun culture and the gradual erosion of our constitutional rights under our increasingly socialistic government.This book has reawakened the interest in the shooting sports that I enjoyed so much in my youth. It is a must read for those who want a picture of how the puzzle of our demise is put together. I must warn you though, it may make you mad as hell."
5,Eye opening,"All I can saw is wow. A very interesting look into the ""unintended consequences"" of over-zealous gun control. The lines drawn between modern day and Nazi Germany of WWII vintage is downright scary. Many different types of readers may enjoy this however those who are in the ""gun culture"" will appreciate it most."
5,Great read!,"The Biased reviewer shown on the main page from Publishers Weekly compares this book to ""The Turner Diaries"" in an attempt to marginalize the author, the book and it's readers. It's more proof of the left wing bias the ""main stream"" media has. The biased reviewer doesn't have the courage to review the book so (s)he just stoops to mudslinging. How sad and typical. The book's a great read, pick up a copy and see for yourself!"
5,All persons who value freedom need to read this book!,"This is an amazing book. Everyone who considers themself an American citizen needs to read it. I read it in 24 hours at the expense of everything else. It will make you angry, but the ultimate goal I think is to make you determined ... DO SOMETHING! Don't let this happen to us."
5,Profound and Stimulating,Explodes with the possibility of what can happen to any law abiding citizen when we legistlate away our rights and the goverment decides to come after us.
5,"The most important, and best book I've read in 10 years.","I bought John Ross's book because I, like him, am concerned, no appalled by, the attacks on our freedom in America. That's why I bought the book. I read the whole book, all 800+ pages in two days because John Ross is a superb storyteller. Now, a few days after reading it, I am once again contemplating reading it again. It's the best book I've read in a decade."
5,A classic,"This book is an accomplished blending of good dialogue, well developed characters, history, firearm information and a great plot. The theme of individual liberty and the tyranny of the state at the heart of this book is a wake up call for our day and all future generations. At 860 some pages, I could not put it down until I had finished. Always the sign of a good book for me. I look forward to future works by Mr. Ross."
5,Creative visualization,I choose the rate cause this is a really good book. I have done some of the exercises. I recommend this book to anyone.
3,Only good for newbies,"If you are acquainted at all with any kind of self hypnosis, autogenics, or other relaxation techniques this book will be unnecessary. I was hoping for a refresher course or at least some interesting new ideas but it is really only an overview of the topic. It does have some scripts for the neophyte which might be of interest if you have never practiced this discipline.Overall it is more of a general new age manual than a discussion of the merits and mechanism of thinking visually or creativity."
2,You must already be successful!,"I read this 17 years ago and found it interesting, though it really didn't help me much. Several of my friends have also read it and it seems to have worked miracles for them. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this book will work for a certain strata of society (mainly overly educated upper middle class liberals)! Everyone I know who has experienced success thru reading this book was already living an extremely comfortable life. This book simply helped them succeed further in new areas."
5,Creative Indeed,"Let me just say that I was at strange place in my life when my father recommended I read his copy of Shakti Gawain's ""Creative Visualization"". He handed me a very old, used copy and I forced myself to open it up. I hadn't read a book in years before this one. After I opened it up, I just couldn't put it down. This is, surprisingly enough, very easy to read. Gawain is an extremely positive writer with nothing but good to say about you, her reader, and life itself. She'll make you feel warm inside with her ""affirmations"". Basically, what ""Creative Visualization"" is about is using your mind and imagination to obtain what you so intimately desire in life. There are explanations in the book as to how this is so and they do make sense. There are many great exercises as well that you can use to help in using ""Creative Visualization"" that just about anyone can find helpful in some form or another. I'm really glad that I was fortunate enough to read this as it has helped me greatly."
4,Maybe the last book you need on visualization...,"Just about anyone who has read a self-help book with any kind of spiritual or meditative bent has been touched by book. Many people feel that it has never been surpassed in its simplicity and focus. Gawain takes time to explain the idea and process of meditation and visualization and then uses the information to look further in to concepts like flow, prosperity, healing, and self-image. Her writing is simple and the concepts are easy to understand. The book is surprisingly non-religious or spiritual unlike so many other books on the same topics. Might be the last book you need on visualization."
5,A Wonderful Guide to Creating Your Own Reality,"This book is very empowering. Shakti Gawain presents the readers with the tools for focusing on and creating their own reality. She also provides insights on really determining what a person wants and finding their own individual purpose in life, as well as creating better personal relationships. My putting these tools to use and through practice, I have already begun to come into a new awareness in my life. I highly recommend this book."
4,A Millionaire Inspired Me To Read Many Books,"Creative Visualization is the tool that many successful people have used in order to achieve what they wanted. I went to a seminar in San Diego this year,a lot of affluent people in that place.There was a speaker whose story captivated my attention quickly.His family had a successful business and he made a decision that put them all in jeopardy to the point that he only had $4,000 left in his account.He visualized himself in a successful place. He visualized his home, his account, his family into success and ""boom""!!! He became a millionaire again.I found this book online,the average mind will not understand this.This is a metaphysical book.But you want a change in some area that is why you are reading this review.This book will help follow the exercises and I know that you will help to inspire others."
4,Lengthy and informative,"Since I am into manifestation subjects, I bought this CD and listened to it. I like it at first but as my listening went along, I noticed that Gawain's voice was getting tired or should I say boring. It doesn't diminish the value of this book though. I should know because I've already read her Creative Visualization book before.It's great for listening while working and driving. I just play it again and again. This is the same thing that I do for The Science of Getting Rich which is still my favorite manifestation CD."
5,This book is EXCELLENT,"I used this book for different areas of my life. Everything that I believed in my to be -- was! I changed my thoughts. I began to view myself differently--more postively and things in my life began to change. Instead of attracting the same type of negative energy I began to attract postive people, places, experiences, and events all because I changed my mind and began to experience love and loving for the first time in my life. Love is Good for me!This book is excellent I recommend it for people everywhere!"
5,A classic book on creating your life as you desire it to be,"Shakti Gawain's classic work, CREATIVE VISUALIZATION, truly stands the test of time. Although I read it for the first time in April 2001 (the original 1978 first edition version), I was thoroughly impressed with the way Gawain can write such a practical guide to the process of how we create our lives from our thoughts and feelings.Gawain includes many exercises which help readers learn how to relax, how to visualize, contact their higher selves, program prosperity, heal themselves and others, meditate, and state meaningful affirmations. I especially enjoyed her ""pink bubble"" manifestation meditation for bringing what you most desire to you.I feel very at home with the exercises and techniques outlined in CREATIVE VISUALIZATION, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in transforming their life for the better."
5,CREATIVE VISUALIZATION,THIS BOOK IS THE BIBLE FOR ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO BECOME. I THINK THAT IT WILL ADD A NEW DEPT TO UOUR LIFE.
2,So-So,This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings.It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
3,If it speaks to you when look at it buy it othewise leave it.,"Looking at the very enthusiastic 5 star comments you feel draw to it. And certainly there is not reason to doubt that for many readers the book provides wonderful advice. However, for a rational skeptic like me, the author's advice sounded cheesy and simple minded so I left it and the middle and send it to my son's school library where it might be picked up by someone who could place its faith on reciting positive affirmations to change its life. So my advice is browse it at book shop and if it rings a bell on you go for it, otherwise buy a novel its more fun."
2,Nothing new,If you have read Wayne Dyer or Deepak Chopra you will have no need for this book - its a repeat of their books and others like it.
1,"So light, so fluffy....","...it's almost not even a book! It's ""reddi-whip!"" If you want whipped cream in a can for the mind this is your book. If you want to get what you want start with ""The Powermind System"" -- it's a compendium of some of the best and most utilized self-help techniques. This Shakti Gawain is for lightweights only."
3,I am skeptical...,"I started this book with the highest of hopes wanting to make some changes in my life. I did all of the exercises and, four months later, nothing has come to fruition. It is a a nice thought to be able to draw a treasure map and write some affirmations to change your life, but for me it did not work. So, sadly, I am skeptical of the tactics in this book.Alternatively, I would recommend Deepak Chopra's The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire. The exercises have worked better for me."
3,Didn't last for the long haul,Took this to help with sleep and depression as I was trying to avoid a prescrption drug. Seemed to work for a few months but then didn't notice much after that. Kind of felt like I did before taking it. Was not interested in increasing dose as that scares me. Stopped taking it because there was a possibly that it would interact with a med I was to start taking. Did not notice any withdrawl or adverse side effects from stopping it.
2,Got too drowsy,"I thought I had ADD so I tried this.But actually maybe I don't have ADD?I don't know but for me when taking this it made me SO drowsy andtired and sleepy that it was impossible to get any tasks done. I was so tiredall day long. Instead of helping me focus it did the opposite.I just wanted to lay down and go to sleep EVERYDAY.Maybe if I kept using it it may have changed but could not keep the sleepy, drowsinessgoing another day. I took it for a couple of weeks.Good thing was after I stopped taking it I was so much more focused and wanting toget things done and energized. That's about it."
5,Best type of l-tyrosine to buy,This type absorbs faster and better than the regular L-tyrosine. I did notice a difference. I buy it whenever it's available.
3,Too Early To Tell?,I've been using this product for about 6 weeks now and have not noticed any difference from before I began using it. Perhaps it just takes time to build up in one's system and it's too early to tell?Update as of December 2012: Don't waste your time with this product.
1,Folic Acid?,"N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine, so any brand will do, as long as it comes from a reputable company. For some reason, however, Source Naturals (a company I have always considered to be reputable, so I'm assuming this is just an error in someone's judgment that will be corrected sooner rather than later) has elected to add 400 micrograms of folic acid to each 300 mg tablet. Why do that? How does such a large amount of folic acid contribute to the metabolism of N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine? Other manufacturers add B-6, but SN is the only company I can find that adds folic acid. Given that high doses of folic acid are now implicated as a cause of lung, prostate and colon cancers, I cannot fathom why anyone who takes a multivitamin or a B-complex (because most contain at least 400 mcgs) would add to their risk by taking this product."
1,Slow Service,If you are looking forward to get your items two weeks after you order it. then go ahead and wait . GNC has it the same price but much faster. It would probably be 5 minutes from home. It definitely wasn't worth it
3,Sign of the Beaver Guide Review,This guide is a great resource for teaching a unit on Sign of the Beaver. All of the guides in this series are GREAT!!
5,"Brilliant writing and art, beautiful book","I saw this book reviewed in Bust mag and am so glad I got a copy for myself. Peggy Phelan and Helena Reckitt have accomplished a ""portable gallery"" in this book--it is like seeing all of the works themselves, but with commentary that helps at every step of the way.Peggy Phelan's introduction is great because she draws everything together in a way that I couldn't do on my own, and actually, I am amazed ANYONE could do it. Wow.The book is expensive but worth it because otherwise you would have to buy about 100 books to try and do for yourself what they did here.Peggy and Helena, and all the artists, YOU ROCK!!!"
5,Art and Feminism,"This book is a great ""picture book"" for anyone interested in art and/or women artist. The descriptions of the work are concise, giving enough information to make you want to investigate further. A necessary addition to any art book collection."
2,Price Gouging,"Amazon is always the first place I go to for books. The consumer reviews here for this book are wonderfully informative, but the price is ridiculous. I've found this book (in the same format) for about 50% less by shopping around."
4,Nice looking boots,"These boots look very cute, are warm enough, but kind of narrow in front, even for a narrow foot."
5,Texas Death Metal,"These are local DFW (Dallas/Ft. Worth) boys that know how to tear it up. If you can handle it, buy it!! Guaranteed to please!!!"
1,All they did was change cover!,"This cd is ripped off the Texas metal band Kingdom of Dead, exact songs everything, all they did was change the album cover, buy the real thing instead-Has the demon face on a graveyard background muti-colored."
5,This item restored the life of our pretty old stethoscope!,"The replacement diaphragm and O-ring came promptly and the instructions worked as advertised. It only took a few minutes to install the new diaphragm. The O-ring is what had broken, and it requires a little thinking and patience to work it into place without distorting the diaphragm, but the result it exactly what we hoped for."
5,The perfect originl procuct,"Hi,I ordered a Littmann diaphragm & Rim assembly to my 20 y/o stethoscope and got the original product plus clear and easy instructions how to replace it to achieve the best of it. The new assembly fit the old stethoscope like a glove.However, $5 handling & shipment for $6 total for the product is too high."
5,Exactly as I expected,"My old diaphragm and rim broke. At first, I wasn't sure if I was ordering the right size or parts, but got everything I needed in. reasonable amount of time."
3,Does the job but difficult to put on the stethoscope,"I lost the assembly to my first Littmann about 1.5 yrs ago, and a friend gave me her extra Littmann. The extra was stolen at work, then I bought another stethoscope. That was stolen at work as well, so instead of buying another expensive stethoscope, I bought this diaphragm assembly for my 1st one. It does the trick, but it is a *pain* to apply. Once on, though, my stethoscope is working just fine. (And the moral of the story is to emphatically guard your stethoscope in the hospital!)"
3,Stethoscope,The product arrived before it was expected. My only issue is that it won'tstay on the stethoscope. I assembled ithe diaphram and rim according to the directions but itfalls off the metal piece. Any suggestions are appreciated.
2,overpriced,This item is way overpriced. There is no excuse for charging $17 for something that costs less than a dollar to produce
1,ATIVA = JUNK!!!,"This ATIVA flash drive (hereafter refered to as ""the piece of crap"") worked fine for approximately ONE WEEK. After that, whenever I put it in the USB port, I got some weird message about how the drivers had failed. I tried it on my high-speed computer at work and got the same result! This piece of crap isn't worth the $2 it probably cost to manufacture. I am still trying (several months later) to retrieve the pictures I had put on the drive, and nothing seems to work! I HATE THIS THING!!! Do NOT use it, even if you get it free. You'll just end up losing all your data and wasting hours trying to retrieve it... ATIVA SUCKS!! I will NEVER buy anything with their name on it ever again!"
1,ATIVA MP3 is JUNK,"I received an Ativa 2GB MP3 player for XMAS and read the user manual first. There was no section on set up. It turns out you are supposed to insert this in a live PC USB port for the initial charge. Over a few weeks I tried 3 different PCs for different time periods. The MP3 never charged up. I eventually started checking blogs as well as the Ativa website. The blogs indicate numerous problem and their website is very limited and outdated. They are probably in Chapter 7 or 11 by now or maybe they just shut dowen until the heat disaptes. I think this is just a USA company that imports cheap Chinese knockup electronics. They must not even test them before they buy a batch. The only thing to do is try to return it. Ativa products are total junk, sold cheaply and it is amazing the box big stores dont yet realize this."
4,It works! And it's cheap!,"Though I wish this product were not advertised as ""12-pc. set"" (because there are FOUR pieces, NOT 12), it is economical and it works just fine. My previous tongue cleaner had rubberized handles at each end, which gradually became, what, bactieralized . . . NOT very sanitary. But this stripped-down version is ALL stainless steel, which is more sanitary. I'm happy I got it, and would order it again."
1,Not stainless steel!,"Item cannot be stainless steel because it rusts! I guess one gets what one pays for as I got a dozen for a cheap price. Save yourself the hassle and pay more for the ones that really are made of stainless steel and won't rust. Oh, one other note, one side is slightly sharper than the other, in case anyone is wondering."
5,Good Value,These stainless steel tongue cleaners are much better than the soft copper. They have more strength and don't bend.
1,RUSTY?!!!,don't buy! not worth the price. over half arrived rusted and the others easily get rusted. had to throw away one by one. have gone with stainless steel instead. much better!
2,Got rusted and hurts by tongue.,Previously I had good experience with steel tongue cleaner. But this product was horrible. I cut my tongue and got rusted after 2-3 days. Overall i do not recommend you to buy from this seller.
2,"""Simply Awful"" when it comes to delivery",The product seems ok and as described. But the delivery speed is awful. The shipping charge is $9.99 but the shipment notice indicated shipment via USPS and shipment showed a postage for $1.30. It arrived 10 days after placing the order. The seller should clearly indicate in the item description that it will arrive via snail mail.
5,A Look Inside the Vatican,"This is a look into the Holy City. We are shown how Pope Pius XII lives and works. And we also get a look at all those who work for and with him. So through vivid descriptions accompanied with photos we tour what daily life is like within the Vatican during 1949. Even though out of date today, this is a very interesting look at all facets of the operation of this small City State."
2,"shameless repack of other dvd sets, beware","this set i bought for my wife, resident egypt nut around here. seems its a repack of several other dvd sets with a new cover. Check episodes too make sure you dont have them already. History channel has licensed this too other companies. to milk every dime out of this footage caveat emptor, or buyer beware........"
2,Not Impressed:-\:-\:-\,Save your money.Bought this to secure screwdriivers in a toolbox i transport a lot & it does an ok job at best?? I found a magnetic rail from Harbor Freight works moch better laying flat in a drawer.
2,Doesn't work well.,Didn't work for my snap-on hard handled screwdriver set. The handles don't fit well in their saddles and the weight of the handle teeter-totters the blades up in the air. Maybe if it had a magnet rail down the middle? Otherwise decent plastic construction. No complaints on the seller and the matching wrench racks are working well.
4,Hilarious and sexy,"The play is now extremely politically incorrect, but this brilliant production is hilarious, and EXTREMELY sexy. This is the role that established Marc Singer, as a Petruchio who just CAN'T keep his shirt on. If you think Shakespeare's comedies aren't funny, watch this one and see how wrong you are!"
4,Just as wonderful as I'd remembered!,"It's a shame that the quality of this video is not great, but that's understandable considering when it was recorded. We've gotten spoiled! However, it's still an outstanding production of Taming of the Shrew, and truly as fabulous as I remembered from all those years ago when I first saw it on PBS. WOW! Sad that Marc Singer got crappy stuff like Beastmaster -- he was a very good actor.For anyone who loves the play, and wants to see it treated like the raucous comedy it was intended to be, get this!"
1,Stinks!,"Too bad you don't have a rating less than one star. This was a clown show, not Shakespeare! If you like acrobatics and seeing Marc Singer's bare chest, then go for it. But if you're looking for Shakespeare look elsewhere. This tape will be a major candidate for taping over."
2,Too oiled,Nice product but the face stays too oiled after shaving. Function pretty well and arrived on time. The price is goo in comparison with similar products. I preferred other oils from the same company.
2,"a bit better than shave secret, but still doesnt work well",i bought both this and shave secret they both blow but this ones a bit better i tried one on each side of my face less burn with kinexium but like i said still no good
4,a nice introduction to meditation.,"The Yoga Zone 2 meditation sessions are a good way to learn how to meditate or to get back into meditation. They give good tips on how to make yourself more comfortable in the positions and encourage beginners. I found the breathing exercises most helpful and the stretching exercises really help to calm you in preparation for meditation. If there had been some guided meditation, the video would have been a perfect all round meditation tape."
3,Good motivation for exercise,"Years ago I used the entire ""Hooked On"" Series for walking exericse with my Walkman. Then tapes went out of style and now I needed to add some new tunes to load onto my IPod Touch. So I ordered this disk to add something different to the many tunes I've been downloading off the Internet. It's still great - even after all these years. It's got a great beat and just makes you want to get out there and move those feet!"
5,CLASSICAL MUSIC WITH A BEAT,"I loved all of the 'Hooked On"" since they came out. This composer has taken familiar classical music and added a beat to it. It doesn't change the origional music, so that classical music lovers as I am are not turned off to a ""take off"". All he has done is take the best parts of classics, blend them together and add a beat to them-one that goes along with the origional tempo. I love to clean my house to this. It really gets me going. Anyone who likes classical music and would like to be upbeat as well would love this."
3,hooked on classics,"Sorry, I haven't listened to the cd yet. I bought it based on the original hooked on clasics record albums i hd in the 80's."
5,Fun puzzle!,"I recently bought this toy for my daughters' 2nd birthday. It took them a little while to figure out how it worked (they had never played with a puzzle like this one with pieces that fit together), but since then, they love to get it out and put the pieces together. They are so proud of themselves when they make a match. I would definitely recommend this puzzle for any child."
3,Not Colorful,"I was disappointed to find the puzzle not very colorful. The colors are bland and every piece looks the same. My 18 months old love puzzles and plays with them every day. This is the only one she does not care for. Overall the product made well and pieces are big enough. Unfortunately, it is useless and going into a gift pile."
5,Where's My Tail,"My son loves this puzzle, he has been playing with it daily for the past few months. He mastered it around 18 months but he still enjoys putting them together and identifying the animals with me. Where's My Tail is a great first puzzle. The pieces are large and easy for little fingers to handle. Each animal body and the respective tail are unique pieces so it's easier for toddlers to match each animal and their tail. Some of the puzzles pieces are showing wear around the edges (the material is like strong cardboard). I am very pleased with Infantino puzzles and plan to buy more in the future."
3,okay,Bought for a two year old who is really into puzzles. Good puzzle to interact with but would be better if the peices were a little more sturdy.
4,Cute but my 20 month old doesn't care for it,"I think it's ok. Based on the reviews I thought that this would be an awesome choice but its a little boring for my taste plus, my little girl doesn't care for it. i decided to run out to the dollar store and buy some little cards with shapes and colors on it and have her match them all up and she seemed to enjoy those much more. Just a thought for those who care for similar mental stimulation but not attached to the idea of a puzzle."
2,Not worth the price..,"I got the Infantino ""Where's my tail"" delivered last month, I opened it but was disappointed by the quality of thin cardboard animals. I would not give this to my kid just because the cardboard will chip and get wet if my kids put this in her mouth."
2,Cheesy... maybe alfredo.,"Well This is one of those CDs bought just for kicks, and I got a kick out of it. This whole show is Cheesy. The music and lyrics are dull and boring. There are some cast members that are pretty good, but the show is bad. This is not one anyone needs to get. If your a collector of musicals, then by all means be my guest, but get the cheapest deal you can. Favorite song: ""Hollywood Marriage Sham"""
1,Great drive - just dont use it to store data,"This was my fourth and possibly last LaCie drive.Loved the spec, size, footprint, speed and yes its fairly quiet.Unfortunatley however, and mine is not the first story, the drive is rather inept at actually storing data.The drive was partitioned into two drives and worked well untill it started not opening folders. Instead it returned error 'unformatted drive' messages. This then spread to the whole of one drive before the next.From reading other reviews the problem is the power down which wrecks the drive. Nice."
2,it fell apart,"On mine, one of the FW400 ports fell off because there is so little solder holding the port onto the circuit board. I gave the 120GB two stars because, unlike the 250GB and 500GB in this series which I also own, it actually worked for more than 1 year and a week."
4,Looks and works great,"Installation (XP Home) was a cinch. I've had this for a month and have experienced no problems. Its main use is to back up a laptop in its entirety once a week, so it doesn't go through very rigorous paces. No comment on the back-up software included with this drive because I haven't used it. I already had software that I trusted and hesitated to change since it was unnecessary.Aesthetically pleasing hard drive, seems well-built (love the metal case), has a pretty small footprint, and does what I need. I didn't give it 5 stars, though, because I'm cheap as hell and wished that it cost a little less that it did. However, if and when I'll need another hard drive I'd buy this one again."
2,For techies and Mac lovers,"If you are looking for something simple that is as easy as most things for Windows XP, look elsewhere. Notice that most of these reviews are from Mac users.On the PC side, there is no 'easy' install, like is being claimed here. Yes, as a geek, I figured it out, but it was not for the normal people out there. You have to follow instructions! Worse, the instructions aren't easy to find. You have to know to search for the manual on the disk.No compatible software!Even though it mentions that it's 'compatible' with all the operating systems (it is), the software that comes with it for backups.... does not work on XP. So, that leaves you with a hard drive that you need to know how to install.If you are looking for something simple, this is NOT it. My low rating is based on installation and setup. I am not knocking it, but want you all to be cautious if you're not a geek or Mac Addict."
3,Learn Frontpage,"I have tried this product, and while I have not made my way totally through it as yet, I do not find it so impressive. It seems there is a lot of data that I can't relate...it would be nice to have more real demonstrations, or at the very least, a set of step by step instructions for the functions...and it would be nice to have interactive questions that would really be useful, not just a bunch of ""canned questions"". I did not find it all that helpful, although I did learn some things that I did not know."
2,not thrilled,"For the price (which was a little high), I fully expected to get what I ordered. .......16 ounces of fresh Vanilla tootsie roll midgies. I got two 7-ounce bags. Thats not a pound of candy. And not worth the price. Disappointed in the un-true quantity description."
5,VANILLA FLAVOR SO GOOD YOU CAN SMELL IT WHILE YOU CHEW,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, VANILLA FLAVOR IN THE TOOTSIE ROLL TEXTURE . . . HOWEVER IT COMES IN A 12OZ BAG, NOT 16OZ. GREAT SEASONAL TREAT! (MAY WANT TO STOCK UP FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR)"
5,Love these,"I wasn't sure if these would be fresh, they are perfect. I recommend them and they're one of my favorite candies."
5,So happy!,I bought 5 of these bags for my husband for Christmas. The candies were delivered a few days after my order and my husband was thrilled by what Santa had brought him! The midgees were in perfect condition (not old.)The shipping rate is worth it if you cannot find bags of the vanilla only where you are. I refuse to spend hours driving all over town looking for this product when I can take a few seconds to order them and have them delivered to my door.
3,Severely lacking in female character design,"I quite like this book and in particular how the artist includes the entire process of creating a character (i.e all the discarded versions) but every time I flip through the 'Creating (Beautiful) women' chapter I cringe at how awful it is. All his 'cute' girl characters have the same large eyes and upturned nose - a thing my old teacher used to call 'recipe face'. Show me some interesting females of all shapes, sizes, ages and races! Being a female cartoonist/illustrator I found this rather uninspiring."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I thought this book would be mostly about cartooing, but was pleasantly surprised. Although the characters included are reminiscent of cartoons, the theory and suggestions provided can be applied to anyone creating characters for books or other needs. Although I haven't done it yet (and to be honest, probably won't) the project included in the book that you are supposed to do as you advance in your reading seems like a great excercise of the mind and pencil. I love seeing the different interpretations of the same characters from the news paper comic's point of view, the illustrator's point of view, etc."
4,Creating Characters,Great book to learn how to draw characters when beginning storyboard. Son really enjoyed using the book for starters.
5,great book,"it's very helpful, great layout and the pages are just filled with great work and knowledge. i recommend this book to those interested in character design."
5,Excellent book! Can't wait for the next one!,Tom Bancroft gives some excellent advice in this book. A must for anyone getting into or already working in the industry. I am looking forward to his next release!
5,Excellent tutorials and well-explained,"This book is amazing. It tells you how to create your characters from scratch. How to develop your character's personality by knowing the plot he's in, among other stuf... Really great."
4,From 2 dementional to Too cool!,"This is a great book to take your drawings to the next step. I've been frustrated that my characters lacked that certain special 'something' to make them pop from regular ol' dry drawings to likable, engaging characters. This book illustrates simple examples of a line here, a curve there, to push it up a notch. I really enjoyed the suggestions, and this book has been very helpful. myspace/kris10cartoons"
4,ds,What a fun and exciting view of character creation. Excellent for ideas and a step-by-step process.
4,Good But Lacks Male Character Construction,The book is good overall. However the author spends an entire chapter on female character construction but doesn't do the same for male characters.
1,How do you mess that up?,The picture shows a Jack Rackham flag on Amazon and the label on the packaging says the same thing. It is not a Jack Rackham flag however. It is just a regular jolly roger flag made out of the cheapest nylon I have felt in a while. I didn't even know nylon could feel cheap(er). Since I am currently in Afghanistan (I bought the flag for my unit) the chances of me returning it are.... none. Thank you for messing up an incredible simple order MMP LLC and shame on you Amazon for letting useless human beings sell items on your website.
4,A good pirate flag,"This flag is very lightweight and a little see-through. The design does show up well on each side, and the light weight will help it fly nicely in a light breeze. The cotton header looks like good quality, and definitely better than a lot of other flags I've seen. I think this was a pretty good buy for $15. Made in Taiwan."
2,Nice but n not Rackham,This is a fine pirate flag but it is NOT a Jack Rackham design as shown in the image. I thought Flagline knew better for true pirate enthusists. Moderately disappointed.
1,nylon pirate flag,i purchased this flag in august of 2008. sadly it is but rags dangling from the flagpole up top of our hill. i am disappointed it did not last even a year.
1,Mall Walker,"I got this CD to listen to while walking at the Mall. However, the quality of sound is very poor. Would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Delighted with teaklike table,I purchased this table because I have other teak tables. This table matches very well and looks far more expensive than the price. This table is very portable because it folds away for storage. Read all customer reviews. They are helpful. One customer who purchased the larger table by the same manufacturer reported that the stain on the wood washed off during the rain and stained the patio. I have not had it long enough to determine how it will withstand the outdoor elements. Caution as to this possibility. I will apply a coat of polyurethan or teak oil to protect from this possibility.
4,Too Cute!,"This table is just wonderful! It looks good and the construction is great for the price.All the other tables I looked at were double this price.There is even a small hole built into the middle for an umbrella, and a cap if you choose not to use an umbrella.I only gave it 4 stars, because I can't comment on durability and maintenance after a week. Strathwood recommends teak oil a couple of times a year.I also purchased the Anirondack chair and ottoman. What a set!!"
4,Great height for director's chairs.,"It sits on the deck with 2 director's chairs and is perfect size and height for 2 people having a cocktail or coffee. Finish is way better than the price would indicate, and general appearance is excellent. We plan to stain our teak to match a couple pieces of the Kompur wood and feel the durability will be comparable with teak oil applications. Only 4 stars 'cause I can't rate durability yet."
5,Great Table!!,"Bought 2 of these about 9 months ago, and they still look great after being out in the hot Louisiana sun. The wood looks great and they are a sturdy design. They fold up very compact and are easy to transport (which is great for when preparing for hurricanes!)These tables are really a great deal!!"
4,book,The book arrived before it was scheduled to and was in the shape that it was stated to be. My daughter is enjoying studying German through this venue.
5,Meyer: Elementary German,This is an excellent book for the adult student: very terse. A good reference for elementary German grammar. Definitely a college-level text.
2,Not worth,"If you just want to know what is CRM about, this book is too long (456 pages). And if you want to know how to put in practice these ideas, you won't get too much. Tons of words and little use of them to tell you about ""How to do it?"""
3,a fair interpretation of polka music,"The CD was well made in the usual ""hooked on"" tradition.But it lacked what I call the zing of polka music."
4,Yes....Still Perfect!,"A great companion to the 'But We Were 17-0' book. 17-0 gives every players insight into the great season and the effect on their lives, whereas 'Still Perfect' looks at things from a different perspective on a game by game basis.Excellent read and well worth the purchase!"
2,Hammar Drill,"The item was as promised. It was just as it was described new. It was shipped as promised, right away. It works excellent, have used it often."
5,Great tool,"I recently purchased this Milwaukee hammer drill to replace a similar-sized Bosch that had quit working. Nothing against the Bosch--it did the job and Bosch replaced a broken switch under a warranty that I thought was long since expired--good customer service. However, the Milwaukee will be the one I reach for first--more comfortable, better balance and more power at the tip of the bit. It has done everything I've asked it to do and done so with ease, including masonry and steel drilling. It is a well made tool that should last for a long, long time.This is a medium-duty tool. If you need big holes in brick or concrete or need to break up concrete, etc., get one of the larger rotary hammers. I use this drill for small to medium-sized holes in brick, masonry and concrete as well as drilling up to 1/2"" holes through 1/4"" steel."
3,2004 Taurus dash kit,"The product's construction is aright. However it dose not fit nicely into the dash of the car. Sometimes it falls out when the car is in motion. The wireing harness works well. I wound up putting the stock stereo back into the dash, and used this after market cover and stereo on the floor under the stock stereo. I have a friend who has the same car, and he figured out how to add a sub and better sound through the stock head unit. I think it would be worth doing that way, if you care about good looks."
1,revision to product description,Product DescriptionStereo Install Dash Kit Ford Taurus 00 01 02 03(car radio wiring installation parts): This is a kit that works the rotary style climate controls and has a OEM style dash panel . The kit includes all the necessary wire harness and antenna extension cable
3,Survivable intellectual blather,"This book, like one I read on Henri Cartier Bresson (a photographer), is a long artistic criticism rave which just doesn't want to end. For those that like such intricate creative writing this book gives it in full. What is interesting or a bore depending on one's view is how this type of art criticism writing attempts to expand on a few aspects of art-and-artist until a whole book is written when in fact a twenty page report could have told you all you needed to know. This is art criticism for the sake of writing art criticism thus for those who like such artistic blather it is a masterpiece. Does also cover the historical continuum of the subject."
5,Godai-kun gets a rival,"Coach Mitaka is smooth, athletic, has a nice car, teaches tennis, has a smile that reflects light, and is a rival for Godai. During this series, you see Godai investigate Kyoko's late husband, Kyoko getting drunk, and Kyoko's parents intervening to get her to quit. Further, Mr. Yotsuya, whose occupation is unknown, has an episode devoted to who he is. The Maison Ikkoku crew try to figure out this mysterious character's very existence. Of course, whether or not Godai gets to go to college or must remain a ronin is also determined this season, but how important is that in comparison to Kyoko's love or Mr. Yotsuya's identity?If you liked the first three seasons, you will love this one as well. My advice is to watch it with subtitles, not the English version."
3,Back to the USSR,"Tales, many interesting some less so, related by an American historian of science who was a frequent visitor to the USSR during the Cold War and who witnessed the start of a new Russia. I especially liked the material related to Dr. Graham's personal interactions with Bukarin's widow; Lysenko (the disgraced biologist); and George Soros. His reflections on the balance between the demands of politics and science are also worthwhile.Dr. Graham's writing skills, while adequate, are not as high, in my opinion, as asserted by some other reviewers of this memoir."
4,An inside view of the Cold War,"I enjoyed reading what it was like to be living in Russia as an American during the Cold War. Still can't figure out the value of a science historian, however."
2,Adhesive won't come off new product,"There is a review of another size of this cookie sheet that warns that the manufacturer has used a strong adhesive to attach the product information, and that this adhesive will not come off. I wish I had read that one before I bought the cookie sheets. Now I'm sitting here on Christmas Eve trying to bake cookies on my new cookie sheets, and I cannot get the glue off them!! It's horrible. Of course, the manufacturer's customer service department is closed today: but I understand from the other reviewer that they were not helpful in any case -- said to use vegetable oil. But that does NOT work. The cookie sheets are probably great, but unusable, so thus my low rating."
2,Made in China worry,"I haven't used this yet, because I'm worried about the coating on this product that is Made in China There have been too many items Made in China that had bad elements in the paint or coating of things."
3,Could be a little longer,"The package says that they're ideal for Baritone guitars with a 29 3/4"" inch scale, but what about if your guitar has a Bigsby? They're barely long enough to get a grip on the tuner peg. I had to use a pair of pliers to get them on. Once I finally got them on, they sound pretty good, last long and hold intonation well."
5,Monster tone,These strings are beast they came stock on my prs baritone guitar. They take a bit to get use to because they are thick but the tone is amazing. Cleans and distorted on my mesa tripple rec are awsome.
3,Search buttons...interesting what comes up.,"If you are looking to just be entertained by a so-so written book, by all means, have fun. Rating my own book 3 stars is quite entertaining in itself. For the seller of these three copies -- if you want more, I've got 700 on hand which is the remaining unsold stock. Good luck selling them because I give mine away."
2,"Retracts well, looks cheesy, sounds average.","They don't look as nice as the photo, they look rather cheesy. Retraction mechanism works reasonably well if you're careful with it. Sound quality is average. I'm keeping mine as a backup set only."
3,Ear Phones,I had good experiance with the product although it arrived late. I was also dissapointed that it does not have a phone feature.CKB
1,Not for everyone,"The shampoo tray came in a timely fashon and the quality was good. However, the opening that allows for your neck was very narrow; this made the shampoo tray unusable. Unless you have a very thin neck, don't purchase this particular shampoo tray."
3,shampoo and rinse tray,"The product arrived as promised and would be just what I was looking for except that the neck is very small. I use it for my mother-in-law who is handicapped. She has a very small neck and it just doesn't fit. I end up putting it behind the wheelchair over the edge of the bathtub, hanging from the handles of the chair. It does deflect the water stream though.Thank you"
4,Useful,"This was a gift for a friend that has ALS found it comfortable, has a limited use of her arms. Was very useful when a caregiver washes her hair."
3,Needs a larger neck opening,"This on missed the mark by a hair. It's a great idea, I just think it was executed poorly. The neck rest is rather narrow, so all of my clients that were not a size 0-3 couldn't wear it properly which resulted in water all down their back and on the floor. That pretty much defeats the purpose. If they would modify the design to accommodate larger neck sizes, it would be awesome."
5,Nice slippers,I really like these slippers. Warm and comfortable and the no skid bottoms really are much appreciated. They are warm enough to not need socks. Easy on and off. Good product.
4,Warm & cozy,These slippers are just what I was looking for. They fit great and have cute rubber nubs on the bottom for non-slip.
5,Great gift for Dad.,"I originally bought this brand and style for my father for father's day last year, now he wants the same thing every year- what could be better than that. He's diabetic and has suffered two strokes, so his footwear is very important. He wears these all the time. A great buy!"
4,overall good,"These would of been 5 star slippers except the bottom sole of these were not rubber or another waterproof material. The buying page says they are indoor/outdoor use, but the bottoms will get wet or absorb whatever you step on. Other than that they are good slippers and comfy. change the sole and they will be perfect."
1,Had to return them,Bought these slippers as a present and they didn't fit the person I bought them for.They were advertised as wide and were not anywhere near wide enough. They did look like nice slippers though too bad they didn't fit.
3,Almost,"Gotta wear socks with these slippers ones as they have an abrasive material exposed on the area of the achilles tendon and also the inner-top of the foot. Otherwise, these fit well (I'm size 11.5 wide) and they look great."
4,Comfy,"I bought these for my husband around Father's Day. He seems to go through slippers every 6 months. So far they are comfortable, appear well made and are true to size. It's hard to find men's slippers throughout they year. They seem to be stocked only during Christmas time. Thank goodness for Amazon."
2,"Good at first, but soles don't last","Bought these because they didn't use any animal products in their manufacture. Should have known better, but never had any experience with this manufacturer. Will not be purchasing any other products from this company as the soles completely deteriorated (dry rotted) after only 1 year. I had a pair of lambskin booties for ten years before the soles wore out (when i was a kid/early teen and used them outside probably a little too much). One year of use is clearly insufficient. I hope this review saves people some time and money with this type of sole/manufacturer."
4,Almost perfect,"I bought them for my husband and he loves them, but one thing took getting used to - the somewhat tough labels are located on the inside and took a while to soften up, even after cutting out the bulk of the label. Otherwise, he wears them all the time in the house, they are handsome, and they are rugged enough for taking out the trash or getting the paper."
4,Slippers that feel good,These slippers are well made and warm and can be worn outside witha firm hard sole. The inside is lined and the inner sole feels like you'rewalking on a cloud. A very good buy for the price.
3,They fit.,"My husband has a size 15 foot that is narrow. It's hard to find shoes that fit, but these do. He says they make his feet hot , but I think that's kind of the point."
1,irregular mfg and sizing tried it on all looked well except its only wide enough for three toes lol,this is not what it appears the shape and qc is missing and its not a cheap product shame someone doesnt look into thisthedistshould have thatresponsibility
5,Awesome sandals,"This is an awesome product!Very good material, the inside is very comfortable, soft and warm! the outside sole is of very durable material. They look and feel comfortable. I am amazed with this product and I will be buying more of these in the future."
4,Nice Slippers,Nice SlippersHusband is very satisfied. They fit well and appear to be well made. The lining is nice and soft. He's quite happy.
5,Chukee,I am very happy with these slippers. They feel great and are very comfortable. I really would buy this product again. They are wonderful.........
1,Width ordering is useless,Ordered Size 14 EEE; they sent Size 14W. Too narrow and hurt my feet. Will be returning them. I'll order a different style or different brand.
2,Wider size is not wider at all!,"I've had this brand before and linked them but as I grow older I need a wider shoe so this time I ordered a 10w (wide) to replace my prior 10 slipper. The new ones are NOT any wider. I can place the old and new sole-to-sole and clearly the sole isn't any wider. I've very disappointed and will have to return them, which is a big hassle for me."
4,Nice product,"My dad enjoys these. They fit good but, the bottoms are not skid proof enough for me...I would prefer something more slip proof."
3,Comfortable,"My son seems very pleased with this slipper, he said it is very comfortable and warm. Likes having the fleece lining."
1,ITCHY AND SCRATCHY,"The slipper is very scratchy against the top of my foot even with socks, it's just on the sides of the ridge over the foot. Not alot of floor grip but fine on carpets.With any item you purchase to wear, my best suggestion is to try it on at the store, find the items that fit and look good and are comfortable then buy them online and you should be 90%-100% satisfied....plus you won't be paying the stores ""overhead"" mark-up! This small problem (was the first one with this company) won't stop me from buying more items from this company, I'll just try them on in a store before I do."
1,Not the original Tamaracs,"I bought a pair of ""Tamarac"" slippers with real leather and sheepskin for my husband about 2 years ago. He loved them. These are not the original Tamaracs. They are now made in China out of synthetic materials and have a funny smell. I never would have bought these if I would have known that. We ended up sending them back for a refund. Save your money."
3,Looking for Comfortable House Shoes:,"The Quality looks good for a simple set of house shoes. If you own pets expect to see some hair collect against the fabric of these house shoes. They are comfortable, but don't breathe much. I didn't expect them to either. The only complaint I have and is really annoying is the manufacturer placed a small tag in the bottom of each shoe. This tag tickles your foot arch so you will want to cut it out for more comfort. Seems like a silly thing to do. Right?Overall, I am happy and wear them around the house. They have good soles for short trips to the yard or garage. Comfortable fur surrounds you foot providing warmth and a fit."
2,Liner issues after just a few weeks of use...,"Very comfy, size runs a little large, and the liner started coming apart after the first few weeks... maybe because I got them too large? I'd give them another shot, but in the meantime I replaced them with floor dusting slippers that I totally love..."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I purchased these slippers as a Christmas present for our son, but ended up returning them. They seemed comfy enough but after trying them on there was a stitch of material with a rough edge on the top of the foot which basically rendered them uncomfortable unless wearing socks, which defeats the whole purpose of slippers. The sole is nice & sturdy, but the slipper material itself was too firm."
2,"Overpriced, mediocre quality","After having worn these slippers for about 3 months, I'm less than satisfied. When I first put them on, I was amazed by how soft they felt on my feet. It was like stepping onto a cloud. However, now the inner layer of cotton is completely smashed down and flat. I might as well be wearing thick socks. The threads are also fraying. They are also bigger in size than they should be. I normally wear a size 12 shoe, but I decided to get a size 11 slipper just so that it would fit snugly. But even that is too big on me! I guess I should've gone all the way down to a 10. Bottom line, these slippers should be priced no higher than $10 based on their quality."
2,Unhappy husband,"I purchased these as a Christmas present for my husband. He does not like them and I'm sending them back. He says they have a funny chemical smell and that they make his feet ""burn"". The elastic was poorly sewn on the inside and left a rough surface that scratched his feet. He DID like the sole and the good traction that it provided."
5,TERRIFIC,"Great quality product - love that they came in a wide size. Well made, very comfortable! I would purchase these slippers again!"
5,Excellent Product,"These are excellent slippers - very warm and comfortable. Cushion insole gives good support, good rubber sole, and a warm lining. They aren't fancy but for the money you can't go wrong with these. If you have frosty toes like I do, these will keep you warm. A very good buy."
4,from the translator of this book,"Peter was one of the best art critics in Britain before the 90s; his influence was far beyond Europe and beyond the West. As a personal friend of Peter, I see him as my model of being a scholar as well as simply being a person. I have dedicated a book of mine to Peter, unfortunately, I lost contact with his family somehow after his tragic death. I hope Sylvia, Lawrence, and Stephanie can contact me if any one of you by chance comes across this message: lianduanxh.hotmail.com"
3,No Special Magic,"I did not find the product to make doing my laundry any easier, except the container was easier to handle, but they all seem to have changed containers (I always find it curious how all the different brands for the same product, seem to make the same changes at the same time). Anyway, if you see a cheaper product, try it, I don't think it really makes any difference."
5,one of my favorites,"This is one of those books that becomes a lyric caught in your head. Every word just felt a little too relevant... and definitely the words of someone who's been there, not that I would know, officer. This is not one to be missed. I picked up every one of Tea's books after this one, but this will always be my favorite."
2,Ugly,"An ugly book about ugly people doing ugly things to each other. You'll feel dirty after reading this book, and you should; after all, as a purchaser of it, you've allowed the author to dip back, once more, into prostitution as a way of paying her bills.And that sounds ugly and unpleasant, but honestly, I think that's exactly what they were aiming for with this book, and they nailed it. You can't read it without taking part in its ugliness (and yes, I think this book is purposefully, consciously and conscientiously ugly).If you're looking for something deep and soulful, this isn't it. If you're looking for titillation, this isn't it, either. If you're looking for a confessional leavened with snide and self-awareness, yes, this is exactly what you're looking for. Very slices-of-life sort of thing."
1,The thing about a confessional...,"The thing about a confessional is that no one ever confesses times when they did something good. Times when they were more clever than usual, or nicer. When you confess, you're exposing the times you were cruel, or petty, or stupid.This book is a confessional.There's not a single likable person in the book. This is an understatement along the lines of 'Goebbels would have made a bad rabbi', but there you go. I'd put this book down and feel depressed about life.The illustrations are good, although it was strange that, after spending six detailed pages learning about the main character's tattoos and the crappy quality of them, we never actually see any tattoos in any of the pictures of the main character."
5,"IN ""TOP TEN BOOKS OF 2004,"" FRONTIERS NEWSMAGAZINE","This graphic novel is less about a working-class lesbian's foray into the sex industry and more about the liberation of life experience. Tea reinforces the fact that she's the real deal: Her prose is colloquial and well-crafted--typos notwithstanding. And McCubbin's illustrations? Each is a little piece of perfection: shimmering, warm, and bright."
4,Rent Girl,"At first the art and stream-of-thought-style writing is a little hard to stomach. After around the second chapter, however, I really started to get used to the style and actually interested in the book. It's very gritty and blunt. However, at the same time it really puts you THERE. I have friends that are somewhat like the girls in the book, so it hit very close to home for me. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Softer sound and easier on the fingers,"Ordered these to tone down my practice volume at home, and experiment with a softer sound. If you've been playing with full rounds, these will feel a lot smoother. My fingertips have definitely appreciated it, especially sliding up and down the strings. The output volume seems slightly lower with these.It's also nice that D'Addario color codes the strings on the bottom."
2,BLOOD DRINKERS EDITED?????,"I saw this movie as a child at the drive-in theater with my parents. The scenes of gore as necks were hacked by the sharp gleaming fangs of the undead left an indeleble mark upon me as a child. I recently purchased a copy of the DVD and was shocked to find out that all of the gorey scenes were edited out!!! Why??? This was what made this vampire flick far ahead of it's time. If anyone knows why this is so, please e-mail me. I'd love to get a copy that hasn't been ""cut up"" so to speak!"
1,Almost as bland as plain oatmeal,"I love the other Kashi hot cereal, so I bought the Vanilla with great confidence -- only to be completely disappointed! It has little to no texture, it is very bland, and it gums up very quickly even with more than the reccommended amount of water. I originally bought Kashi because prepackaged oatmeal is overly sweet -- this is not sweet at all. I also found it to be too creamy. If you're looking for an excellent hot cereal, try the Kashi Cinnamon and Honey."
5,"Healthy, tasty hot cereal!","Add almond drink or whatever your ""milk"" preference is and zap for 2 min. Kashi is a fast and healthy meal that will hold you for a couple of hours. I usually toss in walnuts or blueberries. Kashi is a great way to start the day at an economical price."
5,"delicious, filling, easy","it was just what i needed, easy to make and easy to eat. tastes good too! just have to really follow cooking directions"
5,Best Start to Your Day!,This is goes beyond oatmeal to provide seven whole grains. The nutrition from this little packet of goodness is amazing with 9 gms. protein and 7 gms. of fiber. I add locally grown fruit on occasion and I'm in heaven. This is just too good not to like. Keep it coming Kashi!
1,Utterly disgusting,"This has to be the worst oatmeal I have ever had. Forget this crap, get the Quaker Weight Control - not only does it taste LOADS better, but it has less sugar, more fiber, more protein. I got this simply because I wanted a change, and I regret it every day... and I've still got 5 more boxes to get thru."
1,Its Disgusting!,"I weight train so I have eaten just about every brand of oatmeal under the sun, and I purchased this oatmeal particulary because it had 9 grams of protein in it, but this stuff is REPULSIVE.The flavor is weird, and the texture of like runny instant mashed potatos that havent been cooked all the way through.There are plenty of brands of oatmeal that are just as healthy and whole, that actually taste good. There is no reason nor excuse for why this oatmeal is as gross as it is.I won't be purchasing it again!"
3,Disappointed after reading her others,"Maybe I just read her books in the wrong order, but after 'The Silver Curlew' and 'Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field' I really don't feel that this book deserves 5 stars. The plot is less spontaneous than her others and the characters less well rounded. The romance between the prince and Cinderella is abrupt - I know that's what it's like in the fairytale, but Farjeon rose above that in her other retellings. Compared to the vivid life that springs out of most of her other work, this just felt contrived to me.I recommend it only to die-hard fans of Farjeon."
4,Muy bueana seleccion,"Reune lo mejor de los dicos En Una Nube, No Hay Duda. Cuero Caliente. Vox Dei para Vox Dei y Ciego de Siglos. Yo hubiera puesto mas temas de VD para VD en lugar de los de Ciego de Siglos por eso no puse 5 estrellas."
3,"Cool, but...","Ok, these are VERY well done, and in a dandy portfolio- with a few handy tables, to boot! But do you need to spend $15 on something you can just copy or make yourself? Well- in my case I saved near $5 by getting it here, and throwing it in with another item got me the ""Super-saver"" free shipping- so I'd say yes.Buit just buying it retail? I'd have to say save your dollars and get something else."
4,Very Nice Mini-Shortwave,"I bought this Grundig Mini 300 in the ""remanufactured"" version and I am quite pleased. Cosmetically and functionally, it seems identical to ""new"". SW and FM reception are very good, and AM is average (probably due to the small internal ferrite antenna). Sound quality from the small speaker is better than expected. I like the old fashioned analog tuner, because you can very quickly scroll through the bands to see what's available. There does seem to be a bit of ""station drift"", though. I have enjoyed cruising the SW bands, and already and with little effort have picked up quite a few interesting stations---Germany, China, The Netherlands, Venezuela, Spain, etc.If you would like a very small, simple to operate, and well functioning SW radio, this is a good bet. Build quality overall is quite good, and the Grundig Mini 300 has the look and feel of a radio you would expect to cost more. I got it for $15.99 and added another item to qualify for free shipping----a terrific buy."
1,Creative Thera-Puke,"I am a dad in Dallas Texas. If moms are so good at programming children, as Gardner submits, children would be cleaning up their rooms! Don't be fooled by this drivel that masquerades as science. I love the creative therapeutic approach of throwing moms in jail when kids don't want to visit dad. Was this taken from the Third Reich or what? Creative Therapeutics? No, it's Creative Thera-Puke! I'm going to love it when the moms in America who have been victimized, stripped of their children, by the mindless followers of Richard Gardner file a class-action lawsuit against the grand poobah himself."
3,Don't buy for the 3D!,"If you're looking for an entertainingly corny '50s serial this is a good choice. But I made the mistake of buying it mainly because I already had the 3D system that can be used to watch a few IMAX movies like ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" and ""Haunted Castle"", and this set is advertised as working with that system. Unfortunately, as it turns out the original serial was not filmed in 3D, so all they did was add some occasional 3D effects to a mostly 2D movie, like computer-animated debris coming out of the screen during explosions. So don't be fooled by Razor3D's advertising this movie as part of their ""3D Sci-Fi Collection""--if you're interested in 3D movies you should look elsewhere."
1,Dont' buy it for the 3D version,The 3D version is lousy. It shakes and vibrates to the point that it is unwatchable. The 2D version is OK.
5,good amp,i really like this amp and its sounds great to if your thinking about buying it do it its worth every penny and this amp does rated power to it does 50 x 4 4 Ohms Stereo. 100 x 4 2 Ohms Stereo. 200 x 2 4 Ohms Mono.
2,A cheap digital camera in an underwater housing,"The Sealife DC300 is really nothing more than a cheap digital camera in an underwater housing. The inner camera is very simple and has almost none of the features you usually find in modern cameras. It offers you to turn digital zoom on/off from the settings menu - unfortunately there is no digital zoom at all. You'd think, since the camera is customized for the housing, you could at least access all the features , but not so. All the housing offers is access to the power button and shutter release. If you want to change any settings, you have to open the housing. If you take out the SD card, the batteries are disconnected which resets most of the settings to default, so you'll have to reconfigure the camera frequently. Sealife DC300 claims to be a ""dedicated dive camera"" which it is most certainly not. You'd be much better off buying a housing for your existing camera. I ended up returning it to Amazon and went for the Aquapix."
1,Cheap flimsy plastic camera.,"I have had this camera for a few years and gotten lots of good shots with it on dry land. And lots of blurred underwater shots where the subject wouldn't wait around while the camera brought up the title screen and slowly got itself ready to shoot.After downloading shots off the memory card on day, I found that the card would no longer click into the holder. The memory card and battery holder portion of the camera is just cheap plastic. Looking at that, it seems amazing that it lasted as long as it did. I tried to contact Sealife about fixing it and got no response at all."
5,Fixed my grinder,The nut was just like the original and my original spanner worked well with it. The quality is at least as good if not better than OEM.
4,"Super detailed, not many pictures",Not much for photos but the written detail is absolutely wonderful. Would also recommend buying the book to use the reference list which is quite extensive.
5,This book is a must have for all moms-stay at home or not!,"I was a bit frenzied and feeling unappreciated being a stay home mom- until I read this book! It totally put my ""job"" into perspective and gave me a fresh, new outlook on my life. The advice and encouragement Donna gives is extremely contagious! I am using many of her tips in my life now. My whole family is the better thanks to Donna and her wonderful book."
4,The Stay at Home Mom,"Book is great. However, it was listed as brand new and there was writing in it. Never heard back from the sender."
1,"""Being a woman of God in a world of children"" - heads up!","The editorial reviews fail to mention the no-holds barred Christian approach to this book. It does not offer suggestions on choosing to remain home, but dives right in, ""...being a stay-at-home mom will enrich you as a woman of God."" (p. 27). Subsequent chapers include: ""The Ministry of Motherhood,"" ""Presenting Little Saints to the King,"" and ""Supporting the Man Who Lifted Your Veil."" Based upon religious guidelines, the book offers suggestions, such as ""Training a child through discipline requirs that you break his will, not his spirit."" (p. 89). If you want a religious at-home-mom book, go for it. I wish I had known the religious overtones to this book *before* I bought it. Used copy, anyone?"
3,bogged down in Christianity,"This book has great potential. After all, many post-feminist women are discovering, once children arrive, how valuable and precious is the choice to stay at home and nurture one's own family. There is a social movement afoot to reevaluate the traditional unpaid labor of women.But this particular book is not as useful as it might have been, simply because a lot of the ideas and recommendations are bogged down in Christianity-based patriarchy, promoting the mythology of the apron-clad happy housewife who sacrifices for her children, and bows to her husband's God-condoned dominance in the family.Sorry, even though our situations are similar, I can't apply this book to my own life. My choice to stay at home with the children was not based upon any religious feeling. So I can't get into tidying and organizing based upon a bible verse. Those with more religious feeling may get something more of this book."
1,I would not recommend this book to anyone:,"This book did not address the pros and cons of staying at home with the children. It only said how great it was to stay home...and it kept saying things like how us women/mothers have a duty to both our husbands and ""God"" to stay at home with our children. I work part time outside the home currently, and am deciding whether to stay home full time. This book offered me no help whatsoever in making my decision--it offered no stories by women in similar situations. I am not a religious person, and I resent being told it is my duty to be obeidient to my husband or to some God and that I should stay home. I cannot recommend this book to anyone based on that!"
2,SI AMAS A ALGUIEN NO LE REGALES ESTA NOVELA,"No es que no tenga su gracia en algunos (muchos aspectos) y algunos personajes superlogrados, como cierta cubana de la que no recuerdo el nombre, es que tiene una dosis demasiado concentrada de gabrielgarciamarquismos y Gabo no hay mas que uno. Hay pasajes que son mortalmente aburridos y demasiado mirarse al ombligo."
5,Please don't speed-read his one.,"This book answers questions we never thought to ask. No doubt editors everywhere will be pleased to read submissions that have followed these sugestions. Could be sub-titled ""Reduce Rejction Slip Clutter"". Please don't speed-read his one."
4,Good Idiot Book,"Enjoyable reading, with great ideas, positive message that if you really want to publish, you can do it!"
3,A broad survey of what to do,"If you're just, just, JUST getting started, this book will help you a lot. It's a very broad survey with a lot of information that will give you an idea of the field. But don't buy this book if you have a specific question. Need to know how to write query letters? Get John Wood's book, How to Write Attention-Grabbing Query and Cover Letters. Want to know about submission format? Look for some of the Writer's Digest books. Agents? There are hundreds of books on agents. Publishers? Come on, if you need information about publishers, just look. So...buy this book if you are, as the title says, a Complete Idiot when it comes to Publishing Children's Books. Otherwise, leave it alone.-"
2,Hope Kenneth Warren's bio is better,"I read this book hoping for insight into the life of steel titan Charles Schwab equal to Wall's great biography of Schwab's benefactor, Andrew Carnegie. I found some interesting facts but not a lot of color. I wasn't quite sure whether there just wasn't that much genuinely interesting in his life, in addition to his being a successful corporate sort of guy, or whether things were being left out by the author, who is or was part of the Hoover institution at Stanford. I hope Kenneth Warren's life of Schwab (2007) has a richer story to tell."
3,Good But Not Great,"The New York and Washington, DC based duo of Asheru and Blue Black (of larger collective Unspoken Heard) has been heavily touted by the suburban backpacker hip-hop community since their initial vinyl singles. Now affiliated with Brooklyn's 7 Heads Entertainment/Management, this promising group finally delivers their debut album. Jazzy in sonic texture, Asheru and Blue Black focus on conscious lyrical content to accentuate the soundtrack behind them. As with all J. Rawls productions, the tracks produced by said Lone Catalysts member (it's obvious that he digs meticulously for records to sample, but that trait alone does not a good producer make) are the weakest despite the duo's attempts to maintain the quality throughout. Although better than most the product out there masquerading as ""underground"" hip-hop, the sounds within may remain too specialist for wide mainstream appeal. And, in turn, that may be unfortunate given the dearth of quality in rap at present."
2,"It's 2000 plus, Move ON!!","Look, I'm not giving it 2 stars because it's bad, I mean,it's good, but its also like 7-10 years behind the times. With all the new inovators out there(CanOX, Atoms Fam., El-p, Offwhyte, Aesop Rock, Discflex6, illogic,..etc.), I wonder why these guys are still sweatin' De la and Tribe and all the other old Jazz hiphop groups. Music, like life, is dynamic and ever changing. Guys like Mos Def, J-Live, and these guys will never be the leaders of a new sound, and if your not gonna be the leader, your just another member of the Heard, and I'd prefer if you remained Unspoken."
1,Unspoken Not Heard,"I anticipated this LP to be hot. It's not. If Asheru and Blue Black came out with this LP 10-15 years ago, it would be the hottest album of the year. (prob not) THE BEATS ARE WACK. What I'm saying is that I coped the new Cannibal Ox, Outkast, Jurassic 5 (to name a few) and they take 'underground' hip-hop to a different platform and beyond. Unspoken Heard's emcees are decent, but the album's boring. Beats are unbelievably WACK, damn. Come on now. Why don't these emcees get with a talented producer. All I've heard were good things about Asheru and Blue Black, but honestly, don't waste your money or time."
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.",The string to the eye patch broke by the end of the night and the earring kept falling off. It looked cheap too.
5,For the Pirate in all of us,"A great product for the pirate in us all. Got it for costume and is still going strong with the kids. It was delivered very quick and all around excellent service they even sent an extra set just in case, impressive for such an inexpensive item."
3,"patch good, ear ring not good","got this for my sons Halloween and for dress up play. The eye patch is nice, bigger than other ones I have seen which fit better on my 3 & 5 year old kids. The ear ring didn't work at all. It was a very cheap, plastic, clip on earring, that wouldnt even open wide enough to clip onto a 5 year old ear lobe. after I got it on I had to take it off because it hurt him. I know its a cheap good price and the eye patch is worth it but I tossed the earring"
3,A bit too pricey for what you get in my opinion,"The eyepatch is cheap cardboard covered in black fabric. and the earing is not real durable either. I definately over paid for this product by purchasing it online then paying for shipping. That being said, it functions great just keep in mind the eyepatch isn't real durable and I don't see the earing be very durable either."
3,Pirate Gear,"My soon-to-be 3 yr old wanted to be a pirate this year for Halloween. I started with the eye patch & earing. It arrived quickly, and is exactly as described, but he wanted no part of putting it on, lol. I'm sure he will when he gets older, and he'll have fun with it. It's no fault to the product, it definitely is just as its described. Hopefully your little pirate wants to wear it!"
2,Infomercial for selected California businesses,"I found the first disc in this series so disappointing, I will not be watching the rest. I wanted good information about the Napa Wine Region - the inside scoop on remarkable wineries and interesting museums. The Napa disc was instead packed with one glowing B&B review after another. If you want a sneak peek at selected bed and breakfasts in the Napa Valley, rent it. If you have a hotel and are looking for concrete information on vacation activities, look elsewhere."
5,Great Product,"An awesome read. Many of Bobo's explanations should be supplemented by Youtube videos, or by some of the great advice on coinvanish.com, but this book is THE foundation for a practice of coin magic."
5,A must have for any magician,"If you do any close up, this book will help your routine greatly. The only coin book you will ever need."
3,"Original is excellent, the rest are horrible.","To be brief, the original movie is an excellent cult-classic B-movie fans. The other films should not have been made. I couldn't even watch more than 15 minutes of the third movie. Part 3 was almost as bad as Van Helsing."
2,A Respect Super Hero,A boy turn into a Super Hero with help of the toxic waste. Helping everyone to fight evil away.A loving monster everyone appeased his good deed. You must get this box set.
5,An Expansion of the Heart,"I first purchased this CD at a local new-age bookstore. I did not listen to it before pursnasing, but I was looking for something to use with m patients in relaxation sessions. So I took a chance and have been rewarded ever since.I play this CD almost every day - with my clients, when meditationg, when writing as I go into my ""think tank"". My clients find the music relaxing, interesting and inspirational. They request it when given a choice of music during sessions.I used the track #4 ""Forbidden Love"" as a background for a Heart Meditation that I read and use often. I feel a great expansion of light from that exercise.This was the first of Llewellyn's music in my collection. I then purchased the Reiki CD and enjoy that one also. He is now on my favourite list. Keep up the good work."
4,Very Soothing ...,"A very soothing album. Perfect for reflection, meditation and Shiastu of course. Llewellyn is a talented musician and has put out many soothing albums. All the tracks on the album are nice, but then there are some that are stunning:8. Prophecy: The best track on the entire album. It is not as a complex composition, but then composing a simple stuff is equally complex. The physiological affect of the track on the listener is almost immediate, you'll be immersed in a sea of tranquility and every thought crossing your mind will be beautiful.9. The Dreamweavers: This track with Juliana's hypnotic chants will tap into your subconscious. I generally play an online radio station before going to bed. One night, I was woken from my deep sleep by some enchanting music that seemed liked a dreamscape. It was in fact this beautiful track that was enchanting the subconscious. I got up, checked the album playing and ordered it the following morning."
4,Enjoyable little conversation book chock full of White Sox fun facts,"Fun read, lots of interesting quotes tied in with trivia and fun facts encompassing White Sox history... can't go wrong here!"
3,Complicated story lines,"I realise that this is historical fact but there are so many story lines going at once that I am finding it hard to read more than one episode at a time. Previous books I could not put down but I am finding this one heavy going. There are so many typing errors too, most of the time I can guess what it is supposed to be but at other times I am completely stumped. Spoils it really."
3,"A heartfelt devotional, giving deep insights and blessing.","I am reading the Book in german. Stille Gesprarche mit dem Herrn. Please could you tell me something abaout the live of Eva Bell - Werber and the church group she attends. The devotional titeled: I am always in you. Could you please tell me what is ment by the sentence: Ich habe dich weiter und weiter geführt, durch Aeon um Aeon, Leben auf Leben.I am very much interested, please answer to the address below. THANK YOU so much."
5,QUIET TALKS WITH THE MASTER,"OH, HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE WORDS...I ACQUIRED THIS TREASURE UPON MY FATHERS' DEATH. THE BOOK WAS A PART OF HIS RARE BOOK COLLECTION. THE FIRST PAGE MADE ME KNOW THIS WAS MINE FOREVER. THE BOOK HAS FALLEN APART, I TYPED IT IN MY COMPUTER TO PASS IT ON TO MY SONS. SUCH A BLESSING, I READ IT EVERYDAY. FOR 10 YEARS, IT HAS BEEN A INSPIRATION IN MY LIFE AND OTHERS. THANK GOD!"
5,One of the most inspiring books of all time,"The profound truths that Ms. Werber bring to the public are very personal yet universal. Her insights are echoed in Conversations With God, but we must keep in mind that her writings date to the 1940s, predating Mr. Walsch's. I highly recommend this book--and the others in the series--for all true searchers of Truth."
5,THIS BOOK GIVES ME COMFORT,"I have had this book for years and it sits on my nightstand next to my bed. I also carry it wherever I go. I read this book so often, it is now in several ""pieces"". This book is so inspirational and comforting. I HIGHLY recommend reading this book."
5,An excellent book for beginning engineers.,Many structural analysis books skip steps and become confusing for the student engineer. Simple is best when you're first learning a subject. This book was the best out of all the strucural analysis books I've used over the years; sorry to see it's out of print. I'm glad I kept mine as a reference.
5,Jazz Piano At Its Finest,"""Something To Live For: A Billy Strayhorn Songbook,"" was released on Highnote Records in 1998 and is probably one of the best albums pianist John Hicks has recorded. Hicks, who was a criminally underrated jazz pianist, takes us on a remarkable journey with these Billy Strayhorn compositions. He clearly displays his touch and sensitivity on piano. He played with such an emotional and technical prowess that it's just amazing he wasn't as well known as he was.The music, as with anything, has to speak for itself. There are only a couple of words that can sum this recording up: beautiful, lyrical, swinging, and sophisticated. Hicks is accompanied by two very fine musicians: Dwayne Dolphin on bass and Cecil Brooks III. Both of these musicians provide the right amount of support and show they are flexible enough to take the music into different areas.If you really enjoy jazz piano trio, then pick this one up. Highly recommended."
4,Worth the risk,"Even though the band isn't around anymore, this one is worth picking up. The songs are easy to sing along to, but the lyrics are also thought provoking. It stands up to multiple listenings."
5,Title says it all...,"i have this...its funny as hell, recommended with beer and some friends!!!b.walker/TEAM ALEX <youtube . com"
3,"Nice sandals, shipping costly, falls apart in water","I got a couple pairs of these sandals. Like the straw materials. They are nice when they are new. But they fall apart in water. If you get them wet, use them around the swimming pool drinking lemonade, use them after taking a jacuzzi, use them after the shower and a massage, take them to the beach or on a kayak trip, use them in the rain to get the morning newspaper, then they just fall apart. But, use them inside instead of slippers, and they hold up okay. Wish they were waterproof."
3,Great Project,"There is a little bit of everything here. Some rather harder electric, to some nearly ambient. The recording quality is good, not super polished, but that makes the recorded document all the more authentic feeling. Excellent snapshot of a true giant in the industry. You can certainly find more cohesive studio projects, but this is an excellent package from Mr. Levin. It definately deserves repeated listening."
4,Síntesis,"Tony Levin siempre ha sido un respetado músico de sesión (Peter Gabriel, especialmente) e integrante de King Crimson. Sin embargo nunca ha sido excesivamente valorado su trabajo en solitario. Antes de este disco ha sacado 3 mas bajo su nombre. También ha participado como integrante de diversos proyectos: Bozzio-Levin-Stevens, Liquid Tension Experiment, etc.Todos estos trabajos demuestran la heterogeneidad de un artista que, quizás, pueda confundirse con falta de personalidad. En efecto, nada tienen que ver ""Waters of Eden"" (disco claramente ""new age"") con su aportación a Liquid Tensión Experiment (""Heavy metal"" sin concesiones). Este disco que aquí comentamos supone una síntesis de todas estas facetas. Hay ecos de King Crimson, de Peter Gabriel, de música ""new age"", etc, pero unificados bajo una misma producción. Es evidente que Tony Levin no ha descubierto la piedra filosofal pero lo que hace lo hace muy bien."
3,hard to auto focus,i like the lens but the macro is a but diffiicult to work and the auto focus is also hard
5,YUM!,"Started buying the beans at our local grocer, but suddenly found them no longer on the shelf. Can't say enough about how good these beans are. If you always use canned refried beans, I would recommend giving these a shot. So much tastier and healthier. Easy to make. I usually spice them up with some pepper, plenty of garlic, a little salt, and some taco seasoning (not the salt-based variety) before adding the hot water. Be forewarned, though... they do create a little bit of excitement in the lower intestinal track! But, they are beans, after all! LOL."
2,Huh?,"Huh? That is about the synopsis of my opinion on this book... What happened? First... The Story. What was original about this? The only thing that kept me reading was Luke Skywalker's atempt to build a Jedi Academy (Which I admit was Anderson's One Brilliant Touch). Han Solo, enslaved in the Spice mines of Kessel? Come on, Get real. And of course we have to have ANOTHER super weapon? It was really impossible to tell which was worse the unexplainable increativity of the novel, or the redundent references back to previous occurances. Anderson took it upon himself to give us the whole Star Wars history. He constantly refers back to the original trilogy as well as reminding us what happened previously in the book. I nervously approach the next book telling myself it can't get worse. I hope I'm right!"
5,Hey I liked it,The first book starts out with Luke Skywalker going before the ruling body of the New Republic and asking that the Jedi be reinstated. He travels the worlds of the new republic searching out leads and gaining new followers. These must then battle a new dark presence taking over on Yavin 4.Han and Chewie have another challenge--escape from the spice mines at Kessle. They met old enemies and new allies while there.Overall this was an enjoyable book and probably the beginning of the second best trilogy in the Star Wars universe.
1,"Oh, this trilogy sucks","This trilogy brought my enjoyment of Star Wars books to a screeching halt. Anderson apparently took a little look at the bios and didn't go further in his research. The story line is incredibly contrived, the cast of villains is a bad joke. How anyone can reach the rank of admiral (even by sleeping her way there) and display Daala's incredible lack of strategic, tactical AND logistical ability is beyond me. Vader would have strangled her for incompetence after five minutes. Thrawn would have had her executed within the hour. Don't buy these books"
3,A pretty good Star Wars book,"This trilogy is not as bad as the Black Fleet Crisis trilogy, but it just seems too mundane when compared to Zahn's books or Anderson's other book, Darksaber. However, it is useful in the sense that it is the only way that you can get the background for the other Star Wars books"
4,This book was as good as any other KJA Star wars novel,"I am an avid star wars fan ,and this book is ok. I have read the other two star wars books in this series and each bok is better than the last!!!! to fully enjoy this series , dont skip ahead to another book or even to another chapter. PLEASENT READING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Filling the space,"While I do see the merits of many of the other reviewers, I can't bring myself to judge the author in such a way. The ineptitude of many of the characters is beyond reason. Many of the main characters are amazingly flat for their place in the book. However, the events in this trilogy are part of the timeline and cannot be ignored, especially by those involved in the Star Wars Role Playing Game. May the Force be with you."
5,This is a great book!,"It was wonderful! It shows how Han Solo can never be anything but a ""scruffy-looking"" pilot always getting himself in trouble and when he finally thinks he's in the clear, he justs ends up in more trouble. Leia gets worried and its Luke Skywalker to the rescue. A wonderful description of how Han Solo can never get away from smuggling."
5,Great read,Very well written great story line the book kept me reading for hours not wanting to put it down. I can't wait to read the next one.
5,"YYEEEEAAAAHHHHH, BABY!!!!!!","A wonderful Star Wars book, imaginative, without all of that high-tech stuff that sometimes you can't understand. It has some high-techness, but overall it's a great book! I loved the characters and the Sun Crusher was awesome! He weaves a fantastic plot, and I also recommend the other books in this fantastic trilogy. And Some of the most exciting parts are about the spice mines and the Sun Crusher! I love the part when Lando and Luke go to Moruth Doole! That is the coolest part! I seriously recommend this book to anybody who loves a good science -fiction."
5,Anderson Rules,Wow. This book was amazing. I read all three in 4 days. These were the first Star Wars books I had ever read and I loved them. Like StarWars? Like Books? Get this.
5,Great! I love Kyp!,"I loved this book. The plot twists with Han Solo are amazing and inventive- going from the very interesting spice-mining to a secret Imperial base! I also liked the blob race thing. Even though it didn't have much of a point, it was very entertaining. I loved how the storyline switched between Leia, Han, Luke and Lando. One of the HUGE reasons I love this book is Kyp Durron. I LOVE him. He's like my favorite character in the NJO series(yes, I'm reading out of order) and i was interested to see how we're introduced to him. Though I must agree that SOME of the characterisation was off at points, I don't see what some people are complaining about.MTFBWY!-Murl"
2,Good start then..................,This book had a great beginning.But The characters are totally 1 sided. Don't you think Luke would be slightly ticked when Gantois tried to KILL HIM! want to see the characters at their peak? Read Vision of the future. LANDO GET YOUR EYES OF MARA! IT IS HER AND LUKE! BACK OFF!
1,"Oh, For Zero Stars",It's this sort of book that we need a Zero star rating for. Jeez. KJA wastes perfectly good pieces of blank paper by putting his writing on them.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"I think this is around when Star Wars publishing started to explode, and I gave up as it was looking to be not too interesting.The Ambiguously Evil Woman vs Luke is a bit of fun, though.As I have found out, Anderson writes things at a furious pace, so that he makes a nice living, so this is what you have to expect."
4,A Good Tale,"I liked this STAR WARS book more than the others I had read. While interesting, it wasn't too far fetched to make it believable, a problem with some of the other books. Also, it had some good action and an engaging plot."
2,"Iffy, at best.","I've read many other SW books, and don't find Jedi Search up to snuff compared with a number of others. The characters who are known from the movies are not ""themselves"" in this book, and the excuses don't really make it believable. Slightly original, I have to give to KJA, but if you're looking for the real feel of the Star Wars universe, I suggest A.C. Crispin or Tim Zahn."
1,Not Quite.,"Ok I read this book. I'm not a Star Wars freak, but I enjoy any good Science Fiction out there. But this book simply didn't do it. Terrible characters, badly written plot and cliche's that make you laugh out lound are only some of the bad aspects of this book (and indeed the entire trilogy). If you want a really good Star Wars trilogy then read the Heir to the Empire novels by Timothy Zahn. At least they sound like they have been writen by an adult instead of a ten year old kid."
1,A Rather Depressing View of the Star Wars Universe,"This book marks the opening of a trilogy that should be left on the shelf to gather dust. The characters that we've come to love in Zahn and The original Star Wars Trilogy, are virtually unrecognizeable. KJA goes way over the top with not one, but 2 superweapons!!! Not only that, his villian, Adm. Daala is a worthless, incompitant Admiral to say the least. KJA overuses the powers of the jedi to do impossible feats. This book is dumb, boring, and completely uninteresting. Don't waiste your time on this one, or any of the other in the series for that matter. If you're looking for a good author who captures the flare of SW, go buy all of Zahn's books, he's the only one who has the right feel."
4,pretty darn good!!!,"I like this book. It's fast-paced, and you wouldn't be wasting your money if you bought it. IF you like political stuff, don't get this book. But if you like fast-paced action, then GET THIS BOOK!!!!"
5,A great start to a great trilogy!!!,"This book was great, in that it laid the foundation for the next two books of the trilogy very nicely. If you are a Star Wars fan, get the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn and then get this trilogy. You won't regret it! And to all of the people who are bent out of shape about Luke starting a Jedi Academy: First of all, this is how it was done thousands of years before. The only reason Luke trained with Yoda by himself is simply because there were no other known Jedi at the time. Sure, training each Jedi one-by-one would have given each more attention, I have no problem with Luke training them at an academy. It was the only way for Luke to set up a Jedi core of the New Republic quickly. Anyone who has a problem with this should open up their minds a bit more and should just go with the flow. I'd like to see them write a better Star Wars novel."
1,"CORNY,CHEASY,REALLY LAME","Let me put like this:the lacky Admiral Daala is nothing more than a cheap shot sl*t who got up in the ranks by sleeping with Grand Moff Tarkin ,which only proves her stupidity.Lando is a useless character,and Luke and Leia (and not to mention the kids)are poorly written."
1,Almost the worst,"The best thing I can say about Anderson's novels is that there are even worse Star Wars books out there (i.e. the Corellian and Black Fleet trilogies.) While the anthologies that Anderson edits are good, as a novelist he is horrible- his books are pulp fiction at its worse. Like his other SW novels, Jedi Search has bad plotlines and bad writing; I can only hope that at some time in the future George Lucas will command ""special editions"" of many of the books he has allowed to be published, with the intended market segment being all of us Star Wars fans who can read without having to move their lips."
1,Avoid at all costs. Your time is too precious to waste.,"Kevin J. Anderson proves abundantly why his books are reviled by the Star Wars fan community. Everything Anderson attempts to write comes across as being unoriginal and a rip-off of some other part of the Star Wars saga. The Imperial Admiral, out of touch with the fallen Empire (Daala as compared to Thrawn), the superweapon (the Death Star prototype), Luke on some bizarre Jedi spiritquest. All these elements might work in a more skilled writer's hands, such as Timothy Zahn's, but in Anderson's prose the ideas fall flat. I would recommend staying away from the Jedi Academy trilogy, but unfortunately, the trilogy is the keystone of the Star Wars novels that follow, more so that Timothy Zahn's trilogy. Take my advise, get a friend that suffered through these novels to summarize them for you and then move on. You'll feel better in the end."
5,One of the best of the legendary Star Wars saga,"This novel, along with the other two of the trilogy,is simply the most electrifying sci fi story I haveever read. Through his Jedi Academytrilogy, Anderson has clearly shown that he isamong the best, if not THE BEST of the Star Warswriters. This trilogy would appeal not only toraging Star Wars fans,but to sci fi lovers of alltypes. It is just brilliant.From the very first page itcaptures your undivided attention, and you justcan't force yourself to put it down.Through the whole trilogy, you can clearly envisionall the action in your head.If 20th Century Fox was to make another Star Warsmovie based on any story, it would definately haveto be this one"
5,One of the best Star Wars books I have read!,"I really liked this book. I liked the part about the Maw installation best. Qwi Xux added a lot to the book. She steered it away from a typical Star Wars ""bad guy, good guy"" routine. Too many books get into that cycle. I also liked how you get to meet the twins of Han and Leia for the first time. Kids are always a welcome addition to a book. Anyway, I think this is another success by Kevin J. Anderson."
4,"Suspensful, Good Storyline, True to the characters",Anderson has done a fine job of continuing the story. He remains true to the characters in their personalites and takes you a step further. His plot answers some old questions that one may have encountered from the original Star Wars trilogy (although sometimes he does refer to the original trilogy a little too much). It's easy reading and if your a casual Star Wars fan who just wants to know a little more about everything then I recommend this book.
2,Not so good...,"I am a Star Wars nut, and I was so excited after reading Timothy Zahn's trilogy that I rushed out an bought Anderson's. Big mistake. While I slogged through them for the story line, which is decent, I thought the trilogy was poorly written. All in all, I've been very disappointed by the non-Zahn books, but I keep reading anything that comes out because they're better than no Star Wars-barely."
2,Ech.,"I was so looking forward to this book. I've read most of the others since, but these ones are still near the bottom of my favorites list. The writing seems shallow and rounded, not the sharpness that Zahn brought to the feild. And what's with the characters always repeating their lines from the movies? Prehaps a good book on its own, but in the context of Star Wars, not the best told story."
3,it's an ok book. certainly not the greatest STAR WARS book.,"It was OK but some things were just lame. Take for example that when Han, Chewie, and Kyp are flying through the Maw, Han says ""Only a complete idiot would try something like this"" and then Kyp said ""Let's just hope these guys aren't idiots too!"" Then, later in the book when Lando and Luke are trying to get away from Kessel through the Maw, right before they go in Lando says ""Only a complete idiot would go into a place like that."" Which is just like what Han had said earlier. Luke replies with ""Let's just hope their not idiots too."" Which is also just like what Kyp had said in reply to Han earlier in the book. Like I said, It's OK but it's definately not the best book about STAR WARS."
2,Another Star Wars bust!,"Kevin J. Anderson destroys what a colossal image Star Wars has become. Though his book has its good side in plot, it would better be used on an entirely different theme. Anderson takes away the spirit of the characters. Twisting them into something beyond what we saw on the big screen. Turning them into characters bigger than theirown shoes. The plot was intriguing, I will give credit due, but the wrong image of the characters comes out. They are almost unbelievable, even for this vast universe of Sci-fi. I'm sorry, but this book doesn't uphold the spirit of such a great epic."
4,Worth every penny for your child,"Aside fromLlama Llama Red Pajama, this is one of my 1yr young daughter's favorite books.PROS1. Many different textures for your child to feel. My daughter is entranced by the squishy-rubbery feel of the octupus.2. Very durable - pages are tough and thick.3. Easy for your child to turn the page.4. Intentionally designed for the object of focus to be the textured item in the center. My daughter comes to look for them at each turn of the page.CONS1. Only one - the inserts are a bit difficult to pull out and put back in.SUMMARYBuy the book. Your child and you will not be disappointed. I like this idea as while your child is playing with the texture you can read to them the text on the page. A great way to hold the child's attention. My daughter comes to look for these books every night."
4,Amazing concepts and pictures.,"I really like the Magic Windows books b/c they incoporated both touch and seeing into a book. I will caution people though that you will want to watch the suggested age range on this one. I probably bought it a little early for my daughter (2 years old) b/c she pulled one of the pages out really easily. I would suggest it for 3 and older or just to keep it put up and read it while you are around to help your child pull the pictures out. I love how colorful the book is and it really does a nice job w/the whole ""touch and feel"" thing."
3,"good textures, bad design","The textures in the book are great. My daughter loves to feel them, but the pull out windows just make the book difficult for us to enjoy. We have other touch and feel books that are great, but I don't think we would recommend this one."
1,A Deceptive Rerelease of Sanctuary of Rejunvenation,"I've purchased many of Aeoliah's CD. I am incensed to find that Serene is identical in every way to ""Sanctuary of Rejuvenation"" except the cover art! Buyers be warned if you already own ""Sanctuary of Rejuvenation."" That said, if you like a restful slow bath of warm sound, this will provide it."
1,THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE,"How anyone, least of all a bunch of talented guitarists, can mangle these beautiful songs into the atonal noise that these guys create, is unbelievable........RYPDAL and FORD do excellent interpretations, but all others are not far short of unlistenable......this is artsy chickenscratching that is supposed to show the musos as the PICASSOS of modern music....mostly it comes across as insulting to the originals....these are beautiful melodies and songs that deserve far better treatment than this.....VOL 1 was exellent and I love it as do most people I've played it to......it's not short of unorthodox interpretations and is all the better for it....don't be missled....if you liked the 1st one, stay well clear of this offering....they have nothing in common"
5,A remarkable book--a must read.,"Seldom does a book come along that induces the reader to think on many different levels while taking him/her on a nonstop, gripping ride. Eclipse of the Son is such a book. The characters are real. You could work with one of them, shop with one of them, vote for one of them, or live with one of them and not know it. If the author's intent was to grab the reader by the throat until the very last word, he acheived his goal. I highly recommend this book and look forward to Thomas' next one."
2,Got rust inside the kettle,"Well, this is a pretty kettle. This sure lighted up my kitchen and I really liked it when I got it. But after a couple of month I found some rust inside bottom of the kettle. No way! I did't abuse my kettle at all. I have no idea how I got rust inside of it because I used it as I had used my old stainless kettle. So I called the Customer Service and they promised me to send a new one if I send my kettle to them. Although I haven't got my new kettle, I am not sure if I want to use that kettle again. I don't want to worry about rust all the time. I think I need to find a different kettle."
5,Still Missing Farley,This book will make you cry. Anyone who has loved and lost a dog (or any pet) needs this book. I loved Farley through the years and it was great to find a book that captured so many of his best moments.
1,Paddington Bear VHS box set,"This VHS is much better than the newer DVD; because it haswhat looks like a real teddy, acting out the story as opposed to a cartoon one on the newer DVD.I have both and a few VHS tapes from the 1980""s."
3,"Great, but","This would be a 5 star review if only the box contained both DVD's.I hope it was only my copy that was incomplete, but be warned anyway."
5,Paddington presents London and Great Britain,Paddington is a small bear who is taken home from Paddington Station in London by a kind family. It introduces children to English custom and Paddington's misadventures. These are gentle stories that children love. Great for kids 4-7.
5,Chritmas,"My daughter will love these movies,she already had some of them and adores Paddington Bear."
3,Omega Rx Zone: Miracle of the New High-Dose Fish oil,Lots of new information on fish oil and Arthritis. I am trying it and it seems to be helping with the pain and stiffness.
4,The best inn ever,"This book is so funny because of the character's attitude. It even has strong words, like ""makintosh"".But I like it best because it has poems that rhyme."
4,great book for children,"William Blake (whose poetry this book mirrors) runs an inn where we meet angels, rabbits, tigers, a host of interesting characters. It's a great introduction to poetry for the youngest of children. The illustrations are quaint and fit this book perfectly. I can see why it has won the awards it has."
2,What's the big deal?,"I don't care if this book won both the Caldecott and Newbery - it was a bland and insipid personal view of the poetry and spirit one of the gratest poets alive. I cannot imagine giving this to a child to read when they could be given the REAL Blake, which children are fully capable of enjoying (as the author herself did). The author tries to incorporate some of the original rhythm in Blake's poetry, but that's about all I recognised, aside from the name dropping of some of Blake's most memorable images. Fine, if you don't really care about exposing your children to Blake. The 2 points are for the pretty illustrations."
4,Nice mystery,"Lots of things are going on in this mystery, and all of them are connected. We have rapes, murder, blackmail, Mardi Gras masks, and a very realistic romance between a cop and an actuarial who just can't seem to mind her own business. Entertaining and fun reading."
2,One out of Three isn't very good,"This book is actually three short romance stories about the same town, but written by different authors. In the first story, a woman who visits a fertility clinic accidentally gets the wrong man's sperm. His wife died before they were able to concieve a child together, so he goes in search of the mystery pregnant woman. Of course he falls in love with her the minute he lays eyes on her... and he doesn't even now if she is the right girl! The second story is just as far fetched, even though in this one they wait almost two weeks for the marriage proposal. The last story by Allison Leigh is the book's only saving grace. It's a clever little tale surrounding two children who set out to play matchmaker for their mom, including a very cute personals ad. A nice uplifting note to an otherwise horrid little book."
5,Great read,"I usually go for romances like Rogers, Lindsey and one of my latest reads, ""Anything, My Love"" by Cynthia Simmons. This book was a little different, but I enjoyed it. This book is fun, sweet and sexy."
3,Interesting in itself,A pretty good example of a novelization of a film; I've reread it a number of times and still find it compelling in its own way. The basic plot is involving and Golightly's attempt to flesh out the characters is convincing.
3,Not the Original themes,"This would have been a lot better had the artist tried to more closely to equal the original takes. Bonanza was the worst selection and the Good, The Bad, & the Ugly was just as bad. Had the artist halfway tried to match Hugo Montenegro original artist selection of the good the bad & the ugly, it would have made it a better disc."
1,Show Stopper,"What a disappointment. Show stoppers is just that - the point where the show ""stopped"" It's like reading a comic book with only the punch lines. NO set up, NO nothing, and about the time you start remembering where the skit started, in ends ""half way through the punch line"" Need to ge a complete series, not this snippit of the skits with no set up or explanation."
2,"Loved her show, but...","I laughed out loud more than once when I watched this DVD, but it's only 42 minutes and over half of that is padding. We could've easily watched two episodes of the original show in 42 minutes and laughed a whole lot more. They were on the air for 11 years and this is the best the powers that be could do? What a waste."
1,Not even an ample sampler :(,"This DVD of The Carol Burnette Show stops way short of it's expectations. It is like waiting in line for hours for dinner at the finest restaurant in Paris, only to sit and have them bring you a shot-glass with a toothpick holding a bite of the chefs special. *sigh* Gee, thank you! I felt like Charlie Brown at the mailbox on Valentines day. Zero, ZILCH, Zip!Is this a commercial DVD? Issued just to get you Googling for more...only to discover you can't rent it, you can't buy just a ""best of"", or even any individual seasons... NOPE! You have to buy the whole series for $140.00 plus shipping and handling!! $150.00!!!! Give me a break! It was good, but I won't pay that much. Maybe if they weren't SO GREEDY they would make more off this gem of a variety show."
1,pitifully poor,"Don't waste your money, unless you enjoy seeing the ex-stars laugh at their own antics. You don't get to see them, however. In fact, very little actual footage is shown. Want to be disappointed? Buy it."
5,Great Entertainment,"She was the best, gave me so many laughs all those years ago when comedy was comedy.I never though I would ever see Caryl Burnett again, but thanks to Amazon, I now have a two dvd set of her shows."
3,Carol Burnett show,"I was a bit disapointed , as I thought this dvd was Carol Burnnets, tv shows,instead it was just bits and pieces of some of the funnier moments,, stillwas funny, but I did think it was her regular shows, and not the interviews."
2,Carol Burnett Show Stoppers,"DVD was new. Had seen the show before. Wasn't impressed. Thought this would be more of the shows themselves, not just the actors talking about it. Oh well."
3,Funny video,It's a very funny video but there was a little too much singing. I don't care much for old-style variety shows. But the outtakes were extremely funny! And I wished it was a little longer!
2,Carol Burnett Show - Show Stoppers,"A little disappointing because it is really a TV special/retrospective with Carol, Vicki, Tim and Harvey years later. Their banter is not the best, but the clips are great!Would rather have a season of the shows."
2,***DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY***,"I wish I had paid attention to the numerous reviews that stated that this was not a good buy... I was very disappointed to get a DVD that showed a couple of minutes of a scene. It included language that was, of course, censored on the live broadcast. And the funniest scenes (e.g., Tim as ""The Dentist"") were not even included. Bottom line, if I can't have entire episodes, I'll just live on my good memories of the show... and the 2 or 3 episodes I recorded on videocassette.I wonder if they're waiting for our generation to die off so that it can be presented to kids who never saw it before. WE are the ones who would really appreciate it."
1,Wonderful but awful,"I agree with other reviewers - the Carol Burnett show should be put on DVD in its complete, total, absolute, full and whatever else synonym you can find entirety, this little tiny excuse for entertainment doesn't begin to satisfy. Please, please, please - whoever owns the rights to the show, please, please, please - release it in total. I'll pay lots of money for it. Please, please, please!"
1,Very disappointing,"There are two groups of people for which this DVD is not recommended: those who are fans of the Carol Burnett Show and those who are not. Too much of the 40-something minutes are compiled of new material that's weak: questions from the audience, two songs, a tribute to the show's costume designer, and patter among the stars. The rest of the disc is outtakes, which are funny for about five minutes. I don't recall there being enough time devoted to a single sketch to allow you to appreciate the humor of the sketch itself. So if you're a fan, you already know that it's easy to get Harvey to crack up. If you're not famililar with the show, you'll wonder what all the fuss is about."
3,Not what I was hoping for--,"I am a long-time Carol Burnett fan. Her show has made me laugh so hard I cried. Unfortunately, this collection was just little tid-bits of her shows -- no full skits. I was hoping for more that what was on this one."
2,"Funny, but could have been a lot more","Carol Burnett and team are hilarious in what little we get to see, but it is precious little. The DVD consists of nothing more than the CBS special aired a few years back. My wife and I watched the special at the time and roared, but we thought a DVD could contain a lot more than just the bare 42 minutes of that show. CBS has really missed the potential of DVD with this one, and sad to say, this entree turned out to be a big waste of money. There were enough Carol Burnett episodes over the years to fill a 4-disc pack just with bloopers, let alone representative sketches shown in full! Why are they being so stingy?"
3,"Funny, but not a redo of any shows.","It is entertaining to watch once or so but again, would like to see redone skits in her shows or an actual show. Would not have bought these tapes if I had known they were only segments of here and there funny scenes. J. Asheville"
4,funny but more of a documentorty,funny clips but it was more about how the show can about - all in all a good dvd
1,Complete Episodes available thru Columbia House,"Would never buy this DVD, as I saw the original broadcast and was disappointed in the same way as so many other reviewers here. NO STARS. Columbia House sells what I believe to be complete episodes, but it's also a rip-off because there are only something like 2 episodes per disc and they are WAY over-priced. My niece and I love the old shows == she invested in the collection, which at the time had 9 DVD's ... and she paid dearly for them. Now they're inviting her back to buy MORE! Unfortunately, ""They"" capitalize on desperate fans by putting only 2 shows per disc and charging outlandish prices. However --those discs are definitely better than THIS! Or -- if you get TVLand, they're running ""CB & Friends"" daily. It's a half-hour format but all skits are intact. Happy Viewing! :)"
1,"Show Stoppers - Not! This should be ""Stop - Don't Buy This!""","This DVD was an expensive and disappointing purchase. Amazon did not give a good or accurate synopsis of what this DVD/tape is all about. What it is is a one-hour CBS television special minus commercials (42 minutes) of self-praise by the Carol Burnett Show cast. Don't get me wrong, they're great but we only got tid bits when we were looking and hungry for a full course meal of Carol, Vicki, Harvey and Tim! Very disappointing. Give me my money back! Don't buy this. Wait until something else comes out!"
1,An insult to Burnett fans,"If I could have given it less than one star, I would have. DO NOT expect to find ANY of the classic skits you remember on this DVD. Like others, I wish I'd read the buyer reviews first. Who on earth thought this material was entertaining enough to be released on DVD??? If I want to watch uninteresting people exchange stilted banter, I can watch The View. It's pathetic that this is one of the only available glimpses of that show."
1,TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT !,"I feel we have been cheated , but we couldn't know this before we opened the DVD ..I wish we could return the DVD and get a refund ! It is 40 min of ..nothing ! I love Carol Burnett and I was hoping to watch some of her sketches but this DVD doesn't contain anything , anything at all !!!"
4,"CAROL AND COMPANY STOP THE SHOW, INDEED! BUT WHERE'S LYLE?","Carol reunites with her co-stars (except Lyle Waggoner) on Stage 33 at CBS --- the exact spot where Carol and company had us laughing for 11 seasons. The result? A hilarious visit back to some of the funniest moments on the small-screen (yes, the Scarlett-O'Hara-wearing-a-curtain-rod spoof is here), as well as rarely-seen outtakes, bloopers, blunders, ad-libs, questions from the audience and moments when the stars themselves break down from their co-stars' antics. (Think Conway; think Korman.). It all works nicely, and it's so nice to have this time together, but the of loss of Lyle is noticeable and jarring."
5,Thanks CBS. We love to laugh and we like variety.,"I enjoyed this reunion special as I enjoyed the other a few years ago. Thanks to CBS for allowing the most daring and adult outtakes and bloopers to be shown. It was so much fun to see Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway and Harvey Korman back together again and able to laugh at themselves as we laughed with them at home. Check out the blooper where Carol flashes the boobs she is wearing in front of Tim Conway. Buy the VHS video or DVD today."
5,Funny and great,A great gift idea for anyone who loves nostalgic shows from the past. My mother already has more copies of this show and absolutely loves it.
2,Didnt enjoy it,This video is all bloopers...it doesnt show any skits completely. Glad I bought it used. Still think my mom will enjoy it though.
1,Very disapointed,"I bought this for my mother as a Christmas gift last year and we were sorely disapointed to see how little scenes from the show , andhow much advertising was on it. Sorry..but I wouldn't order this ."
2,"Too short, and without any real substance.","Aired for TV, which means that the ""thought police"" have already cleaned it up, removing choice segments in the name of saving precious air time. Don't waste your money buying this. Go ahead and get the real thing.... while you still can.Too late.. I just looked.. It is not longer available."
1,Big Disappointment with Carol Burnett,I gave this DVD to my son for Christmas. He said it was the mostdisappointing gift he got. Nothing more than the stars of her showsitting around talking. Very short clips of funny moments. Thenshe interviewed the man who did the costumes for the show. PerhapsShow Stoppers is a bad name for the DVD because you are expecting alot of laughs from old scenes from the show.
1,very disappointed,"I thought this dvd would have at least scenes lasting more than 30 seconds. Most of it was the actors on the show sitting around and watching how they cracked each other up with laughter or talking to each other. I guess I will watch what I buy from now on because I was expecting the funny skits like mama's family. I've learned my lesson, I will only buy actual seasons on any of these tv shows from now on."
2,Clips Too Short,This would have been more entertaining if the 10 second clips would have been longer. There were too few clips and too much talking by the 4 stars. The segment about designer Bob Macky was great. Hope to see DVD's with entire comedy segments become available in the future.
3,carol burnett,"The skits were too short. Too much talking. In the skits, we would see the characters laughing and we can hardly understand why they are laughing. The 10 second skits didn't give enough time to grasp the skit. I'm a huge fan of the Carol Burnett Show. Especially Tim Conway and Harvey Korman"
2,Attractive but flawed,"This book is attractive(all glossy pictures) and is able to just show just the basics. The problem is that the CD in the book doesn't boot and it is impossible to do the lessons without it. In addition, there are problems in the lessons and they skip steps, or show the wrong picture for a step. The email for support is also missing, you may be able to use it if you know Korean. Good luck with this pick you will need it, I would look for a better alternative. I have read a lot tech books and work in MIS, this book would not help me complete my job."
5,Enormous relevance in a global world of shock and awe,"This is a book that although fascinating as a mystery, fascinating as a book on Albanian by one of the worlds newest and greatest writers (most of his books have been recently translated also from the French) but the deepest value of the book written by a man who is a brilliant novelist and poet has to do with a global world where all that is solid melts away and truth is defined by dominance and brutality and thus dividing a nation and also confusing individuals and as now after the cold war so much of the world is placed under these conditions..whether in the Balkans, the Middle East or in parts of North and South America this book takes on massive significance....a must read."
2,Find Something Else,"About the only thing this atlas is good for is to give you the geography of Europe -- you could do almost as well looking at a world globe. This atlas shows the major roads only, so it's good for only the most expediant travel from point A to point B. If you want to plan a casual vacation, you need to find maps with much greater detail. Of course, Michelin is the leader in this field. (Some people will find that Michelin shows TOO much detail.)"
3,Lots of work,"My customer picked this product which is a good value compared to other openers pricewise. It came with out the base plate to attach it to the door. I tried to call and get it shipped next day ,but had to provide a proof of purchase before they would even send it. It took a couple days of e-mails to get that done and 6 days to receive the part. The directions on how to program it were incorrect and we had to call customer service to get programming instructions. The product worked great after all this was done. Keep in mind I am paying two guys $25/hr to go through all this. i wlll probably try a more expensive opener the next time, and see if that saves me money. The customer had a DM-100 she had bought which was missing parts as well and had the same programming issues."
3,Pleasant listening,"I've had this on open-reel tape for, well, ages. Lots of folks would call it elevator music, but there are some timeless classics that are done with very high production standards - not using traditional arrangements. The sound is good, and the music is pleasing to the ear - sometimes that's enough, and this is one of those CDs that I'm glad I bought."
4,Just as described,Like all oatey products this was well made and a very simple design. It worked perfectly as a patch panel through my wall to allow connections from my TV to the mechanicals closet behind it.
5,Print is a better medium for Mr. Whittle,"When read online these essays seem huge, but in print they are just right. BW is a visionary, and I was captured in his vision within the first paragraph of each of these essays.I suspect M. Hogan did not bother to read it, but was instead giving his customary 1 star review to anything perceived as right-wing."
5,An Outstanding Read!,"It is one thing to be able to clearly and logically articulate a viewpoint. It is quite another to be gifted to do so with wit, intelligence, and even grace.This is not just a book about political philosophy (though it is outstanding in that area), but it is also just a great read. After reading the first essay, I was hooked. I have since lost several hours sleep reading the rest.Best of all, this book makes clear exactly why we can be proud of our nation and what she stands for. I am buying several copies to give as gifts.Thank you, Bill Whittle. You are a ray of hope."
5,Very Inspiring!!!!,"Book was in good shape and shipping was fairly quick. Overall, a fast and easy read, simply because I couldn't put it down. Mr. Whittle is passionate about America and everything we stand for. This book came at a time when I desperately needed some patriotic encouragement. After reading this and watching Mr. Whittle on his Youtube channel, I'm convinced that he needs to run for President!!!!!!!!!"
1,Classic Extremist Nonsense: Packaged To Look Like Something Else,"Bill Whittle is slick. But underneath it's clear what he's advocating: anti-Semitism, racism, hatred of immigrants, hatred of ""liberals"", hatred of the well-educated, hatred of the poor, hatred of women, hatred of the young...he's sick. And he's pathetic.Whittle's anti-American views---and that's what they are, since today's America has plenty of the above groups---are sad. And it's telling that people like him are still around.If you want to vomit. Or if you're the type who enjoys blaming ""the liberals"" (which, for Whittle is his way of saying ""The Jews"") you'll possibly like this poorly written, poorly organized hate-filled screed."
3,Definitely worth the donation,"The track by Norah Jones and Wyclef Jean, alone, is worth the purchase price. I am surprised no one else has commented on it. To me, this juxtaposition of voices and styles is truly powerful and moving. Norah Jones' contribution is a soft, sad, lamentation -- it ebbs and flows like the waters of the Mississippi. Wyclef Jean then punctuates the sad lullaby with his poignant rap -- ""I hear the engine on the boat, but y'all cant see me waving the flag, somebody please wave the flag!"" The overall effect of this juxtaposition is truly powerful and it makes me cry for New Orleans every time I hear it. It brings images of people on roofs waving flags, rescue workers saving lost and frightened dogs in the flood waters, big X's on houses destroyed and deserted. Bonnie Raitt, Aaron Neville, Harry Conick Jr, and Van Morrison also make excellent contributions. While I am not a fan of about 30% of the songs, I would never consider this $15 a waste of money."
2,Disappointing,"The good news is that the money went to an excellent cause. The bad news is that the choice of artists and songs were not, in my opinion, worth listening to."
3,Pretty good compilation,"Musically there are things that I enjoy such as Louis Armstrong,R.kelly,Dr John,Harry Connick Jr,B.B.King&a few others. but more Importantly this compilation is about taken care of New Orleans&also remembering the rich Musical History&Landscape that is New Orleans. the coolness about this collection of Musicians&Artists is like the Gumbo of New Orleans.alot of various flavors in the Musical soup here acknowledging a very important city,People&a Rich culture.no Hurricane will keep Bourbon street down.New Orleans will keep on stomping. Peace"
3,A Good Start,"This book is good for people who are learning the basics or for FH parents who nod along while other parents are discussing the game :). It provides helpful information about plays, gear, the field, positions, etc. I started playing field hockey last year and for the first season I didn't have an idea what was going on! If you're planning on trying out for a team for the first time and don't want to look like an idiot this book is good for you. However when I read this book I had been playing for a year so I knew almost everything it had in it. The layout of this book isn't anything special and the pictures are black and white and not very clear. This book is a good information guide to knowing the sport, but if you want to get good at field hockey I would pick up a book on FH drills and a stick."
1,NOT A DUDE,"I recently purchased this book and was sadly surprised to find out it had NOTHING to do with the band, other than that this was the book that guy stevens got the name for the band from. Worse, on the cover of the book behind the title is a sketchy print of Ian Hunter holding a guitar. This little bit of misleading info caused me to open the package thereby making me unable to return the book for a refund. Other than a curiosity piece for completists of all things Mott, please do not get burned like i did by buying this book.As far as the actual story, it's your typical narrative-on-the-road type. Again, not bad, but not Mott the Hoople.Instead, get Ian Hunter's ""diary of a r+r star""."
3,Wrong Product Description?,"These are NOT heavy duty aluminum ramp ends, they are heavy duty STEEL ramp ends. The Product Description is wrong."
4,Ramp kit,"Gave it a 4. Item was delivered on time, Very easy to install, great look, however there is a small gap when install the boards. I would recommend it for the price, good item."
3,poor description,"This particular item is made to fit customer-provided ""planks."" The description should define plank size, for example ""2 x 10"""
5,Fantasatic Bike Carrier,"The absolute best product I have ever gotten from Amazon. Fits 3 bike perfectly and very secure. Strong and simple, the best combination."
1,Not worth 3 cents,"This book is dull, dull, dull, and too long for its narrative. It would have been better as a short story. I like to be titillated just as much as the next person, but this story just didn't do it for me. The prose is drab and the characters have little to redeem them. They're supposed to come across as soulful and tortured, but instead they're flat as cardboard. I couldn't wait for it to end."
4,You just can't stop yourself,"You almost feel like you're driving down the road and are passing a car wreck. You know you shouldn't slow down and look, but you just can't resist. ""Exposure"" by Kathryn Harrison is just like that. You feel so guilty watching, but just can't tear yourself away. This alluring but, lurid book about a women's mental unraveling is brilliant and powerful. Ann Rogers grew up as the muse for her father's revealing photographs and when the museum plans on a show of his work, it opens up a whole world of issues she never knew would happen. It causes a tremendous amount of anguish and provocative reactions. This psychological thriller is simply fascinating and very worth of your time.It's not an easy read. And, it contains very mature subject matter, but very powerful."
5,good kit,"Yes, it is true that you actually need to cut off some plastic for more car stereos, but they do give you those pieces in case you have the old style stereo with two knobs.Overall, I was surprised how easy this was to deal with. After I got the pieces cut off, it fit in perfectly, and looked like it belongs in the car.I have a 96 Geo Metro."
5,beautiful mellow jazz,"I love jazz, but tend to prefer melodic ballads or renditions of old standards. This CD easily met both those criteria and far surpassed my expectations. Each song is a winner. I've only had this CD a couple of weeks, but it's already one of my favorites."
3,Light of Day,"Bronner's work is a good read for a historical political junkie. It traces the history of Justice Bork's nomination from it's inception to its ultimate failure. Coming on the heals of Justice Antonin Scalia's nomination and confirmation, the left, led by Ted Kennedy, wasn't going to sit by and let all the gains of previous decades slip away. Gains in Civil Rights, Women's Rights, environment would disappear to right wing ideology had Bork gotten approved. Some characterize Bork's confirmation hearings as character assassination but I disagree after reading this book. His character wasn't assassinated - his previous rulings were exposed to the light of day and America rejected them - and ultimately him."
5,High times Music DVD of the Year,"Great collection of artist on this DVD. Sean Paul, Beenie Man, and other reggae artist from around the world and a bonus CD. Pick this DVD up!"
1,Lasted one day,This is essentially a .39 cent plastic manual pencil sharpener on a battery powered shaft. It didn't last one day at our house. Bought a Panasonic KP-380 and love it!
2,worked for a sort time!,The sharpener was disappointing. It worked for a few sharpenings but then pencils got stuck and now it sharpener jagged. can't use it anymore:(
1,The Sharpener Basically Eats Up My Pencils,"I purchased this sharpener to have a portable sharpener. I liked X-Acto's other sharpener (the Mighty Mite that plugs into the wall here:X-Acto 19500 Mighty Mite Electric Pencil Sharpener, Mineral Green, 1 Unit). Unfortunately, the Mini Standup sharpener performs the polar-opposite of the Mighty Mite. As others have said, it's basically a motorized $.50 sharpener, and I have horrible luck with those manual sharpeners, it's like every manual one that I've owned eats up my pencils (like this one). It doesn't shave the wood around the lead smoothly, and the lead gets so exposed and breaks if I use it for more than one or two seconds. If I had known this, I would have just brought my Mighty Mite around, even though I have to plug that one in."
1,"Great at first, then breaks down","Great electric sharpener at first. Pencil lead comes out clean and pointy. Device requires 4 AA batteries to operate. But after a few uses, the sharpener breaks down and pencil comes out dull and takes more shavings than require. My experience is that it eats the pencil up. Instead of buying this unreliable product, best to buy a manual sharpener that costs maybe less than $1 at the nearby store."
1,noisy and flimsy,"I do not recommend this product. It's quite working at first but the more I use, the less it works. Finally rest in peace an year after I began to use it."
1,I Hate It,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. It caused battery leak within less than 5 sharpenings, which created a terrible mess to clean up. In my opinion, it should be banned from amazon.com"
4,a sweet realistic story about marriage,"The story is about a young woman who leaves Brooklyn to meet her fiancee who is a law student in the Midwest. Thelove, financial struggles and adjustment to marriage, and social lives make up the heart of the story. It's similar to the authors own start as a mother, wife and writer. It has the same down to earth, genuine style as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn but it's happier because of the love story and the setting ( a Midwestern college town)."
1,Not Betty Smith,I did not read this so it may or may not be a good book. All I know is it is not the Betty Smith book I was expecting.
5,Z at her beZt!!!!!!!!,"This is a great CD, a pitty that it is difficult to obtain and it is not well known. I think that Rachel Z put in a lot of work for this thematic output that really deserves a wider recognition.I am not particularly fond of her ""smooth jazz"" ""Love is the Power"", but her latest CD, ""On the milkyway express"", a trio effort, is another big YEZ!!!!! for Rachel Z. You can also hear Rachel in the CD ""VERTU"". Keep at it Z!!!!!!!!"
1,Be Very Careful!,"These chairs are not sturdy, and ultimately dangerous. Does not hold a 150 male - the chair broke apart into pieces causing a very hard fall.Not Amazon quality, sorry to say."
1,You get what you pay for.,"These chairs are cheap, unfortunatly they are of poor quality. I weigh 200lbs and the chair did not support me and broke under my weight."
5,Murad Shampoo,I really love this shampoo. It's great for fine or thinning hair.No beauty shops in my area carry it. So I tried Amazon and found it.The service was great and found just what I was looking for.
4,Murad shampoo,I have only been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and so far so good. I like how my scalp is feeling and my hair is color treated and it seems to be retaining its color better with this shampoo than with what I had been using.
4,Eli's Wings,"I bought this book as serendipity led me to it... while reading 'The Year We Seized the Day' co- authored by Elizabeth Best. My niece is anorexic and very ill and this book gave me an inside view on the condition - something I very much needed as it turns out. It is written with honesty and simplicity and I would recommend it to anyone needing guidance into this frightening condition. I learned that it IS a disease and as such has to be treated as you would treat illness- not just as a destructive whim of a teenage girl. I have passed it on to my sister so that it may light up a very dark space in her life and give her some strategies to deal with her daughter, some grace to cope with the uncopeable and some hope at this dark time for her. Thank you for coming to me 'Eli's Wings' and I hope that you make your way to others who need you...PS This book is out of print in Australia so you can buy it second hand overseas. Eli's website says that there is a new edition coming out soon."
2,"Interesting, frustrating, confusing","I found this book interesting and at the same time extremely frustrating. There were many times when I wondered what the author meant by descriptions that were unclear. She often skipped important information and sometimes added it later. It seemed as if she wrote from a perspective of being currently immersed in her eating disorder, rather than it seeming like she was looking back with insight, even though she was over it when she wrote this book. I wanted to know what her various symptoms and behaviours meant, but mostly she didn't explain them. This book seems to have been written from a New Age perspective (despite the author claiming she was a Catholic). I found her writing style a bit mystical and confused. A worthwhile story and a page-turner, but it needed a lot of editing and re-writing."
1,"This book should be titled ""How to Reload Ammunition""","I purchased this book expecting to learn more about Cowboy Action Shooting. In stead I find that approximately 2/3 of the book deals with reloading ammunition. I did not learn anything new about CAS. If you want to lean about CAS this is not going to supply anything meaningfull. If on the other hand you want to learn about reloading ammunition, this book might get you started. I would give this book less than one star if I could!"
4,nice book but too involed with the tenichal aspects side,good book for a member of sass interested in the reloading proccess of the black powder portion of the sport. not enough for the beginner. aspects to cover for the beginner should have delt with clothing and acoutraments. a nice plus would have been a list of clubs around the country.
1,Live At Sturgis/ 38 Special,"I am sorry to say this was the biggest mistake I have made in buying music! This product is poor quality, the DVD does not work(I tried several players and the my wife's computer which is almost new) and it will not play. The CD list is not accurate two songs that it lists are not on it. I think this product is not ready for the market and should be pulled off."
3,A surprise!,"Inexpensive pickup to checkout (being a surround freak - Quad when it came out in the 70's - long ago and far away) and I was surprised that this actually decent. OK sound but band sounds good and the disc rocks for the most part. I enjoyed listening to it. This isn't a continuous set, standard mushy sound but OK. Big 38 Special fans might want to pick this up before it gets expensive. Audio only but that's why it's called dvda.... Duh."
2,yuck bluck,When I bought this toy for my 3 year old daghter all she did was stroke it kindly and the head popped off don't buy it it's junk!
1,Memories,Good reading and not too sensational. Could have been more informational though on her life after divorceNot a historical save.
1,"Duplicity, Dishonour and Colonialism","The life and times of Meinertzhagen colonial ethusiast, Indian hater (he killed more of his fellow Indian Army soldiers than his enemies in East Africa), rabid pedersat, habitual liar, lifelong coward - what more can you expect from a cardboard hero of the Brits!"
3,chairs wobble,"these were the least expensive chairs i could find, so i guess you get what you pay for. i bought 8, and about 3 of them don't wobble."
2,"Purchased as gift, arrived with broken pieces","I purchased the chairs as a gift for a friend for Christmas. One of the chairs arrived broken and unusable. I tried to contact the supplier, but never heard back."
1,Junk,"These chairs by furnitemaxx are awful. When we received them, two of the chairs were completely thrashed which I'm assuming is due to bad packaging. The two ""good"" chairs that we did put together were EXTREMELY wobbly because the legs all had different lengths by several inches. It was like they were supposed to be matched up somehow, but the vague instructions didn't specify anything like that. When we contacted the company about the broken ones, both by e-mail and phone several times, they finally sent us two replacement seats. The only problem was that they didn't have holes in the bottom to insert the legs! After several e-mails, phone calls, and sending pictures of the entire mess, they finally got back to us saying they'll give us a refund and we can keep the ""chairs"". We burned them all in a bonfire last week."
1,"poorly made, flimsy chairs","My husband and I ordered these chairs because they seemed to closely match our kitchen set. We were wrong, the only thing that is similar is the style of chair. The quality is poor and it took the company nearly a month to replace the 2 broken bolts. I tried to contact them again because when I finally received the replacement bolts we noticed that one part of the legs were broken. I will chalk this up to ""you get what you pay for"". Next time we will buy local and pay the higher price."
4,Surprised by detail,"Knowing very little about Nostradamus, i decided to get some books on him, but didn't want to spend a fortune. This book is so detailed about his life, all of his writings it leaves very little unturned. I'm glad i picked this book to learn about this historic person."
1,Might be different if another author interpretted,"This book is difficult and needs better interpretation. If I thought it was so difficult to read and understand, I wouldn't have bothered to buy..."
4,Solid and tasteful.,"An exciting 1995 session for NYC Records featuring Craig Handy (tenor), Lonnie Smith (B3), Lenny White (drums), Papo Vazquez (trombone), and guitarists John Scofield, Hiram Bullock, and David Fiuczynski. The tracks are:1. Tokyo Blues (Horace Silver)2. No Room For Squares (Hank Mobley)3. If Ever I Would Leave You (Lerner & Loewe)4. So Tired5. Blues in a Jiff (Sonny Clark)6. Una Mas (Kenny Dorham)7. Down Under (Freddie Hubbard)8. Blues on the Corner (McCoy Tyner)"
2,"neither chart nor buster, worst sound and artwork","With a team like Scofield, Dr. Smith and White you would expect busting energizing jazzfunk. It is not there. It is tame. Not bad, but not funking good either. It is propably recorded early on a monday morning, without the coffee being served. Automatic playing, no fun.The sound quality is awfull. Like listening to an AM-radio: was it recorded in the mid 20-ies?? I checked my hifi when I first listened this CD: it is stereo (I guess) but nothing more.There is one thing even worse: the art design. ""Chartbusters""... who the hell is going to buy a CD with this titlle without mentioning the performers??But Dr. Smith is there, and his playing/sound is a delight and stands out all the other."
3,Old but the seas dont change,If you are the type of diver that likes to know the background on your wreck dives then this is for you. The history behind the ships and wrecks is very well laid out. Its a good tool to have if your going to dive the wrecks in Bermuda.
5,Ya don't understand,The reason why most dem people hatin on Choppa cuz they don't understand his music or where he comin from. Choppa did his thang on dat and can't be stopped.
1,Master P Knockoff,"Choppa is crap. If any of you have heard Master P's Ooo Wee, then you have heard Choppa's new ""smash"" hit Choppa Style. They are the same song, and this is another typical No Limit record. Choppa just used Master P's old beats."
2,Sad,Was hoping for more authenticity in narration. It seems that the tone of Ishi's voice conveys more truth. The sound track leaves room for improvement in narration.
5,68 photographs gleaned from the original collection,"From 1896 to 1930, famed photography pioneer Edward S. Curtis documented Native Americans, their cultures and way of life throughout the western United States and British Columbia. His years of field work resulted in the publication of a unique twenty-volume visual record, accompanied by his written observations. 68 photographs have been gleaned from the original collection of hundreds of period photographs and compiled into the Aperture edition of The North American Indians, along with Curtis' field notes detailing the content of the images. Enhanced with an informative introduction by Native American expert Joseph Epes Brown, The North American Indians is an enthusiastically recommended contribution to academic and community library Native American studies reading lists and reference collections."
1,don't bother,there are plenty of kosher cookbooks that are far better than this one. take it from me- the recipes are not worth your time and money.
1,broken,"This product fell apart in three weeks. It was treated well, but is basically cardboard. It did not hold up to light use which is surprising considering that if I made this product I would assume that it would be used heavily."
3,A collection of old articles,"A collection of old articles from the nineties, rewritten in book-form. Some chapters seem a bit dated. The empirical basis of the book is aggregated data from the eighties and nineties and two case-studies, one from Chicago's South side and one from the suburbs of Paris based on participant observation.Wacquant's idea of quantitative analysis seems to be to use aggregated data to illustrate what he thinks are explanations to the phenomena he is describing. Not sure it is really convincing. Nor is his theory of unemployment being the reason for the marginalization of ethnic minorities. Some interesting points still. Especially his comparative analysis of ghettos in Chicago and Paris. He argues convincingly that the ghettos in Europe are different from ghettos in the US, and thus that we are not witnessing an americanization from below of European societies."
5,Adorable puppet!,"This puppet is absolutely adorable and is so well made, it has the quality of a ""Sesame Street"" puppet. Recommended for 3 yrs+ and even for adults. My grandchildren have had hours of fun pretending with their puppets. I bought three of them and their imaginations have soared making up scenes with their puppets. Even adults can enjoy ""pretending"" with these puppets"
5,Princess puppet,"The Melissa & Doug puppets are well made and have nice finishing touches that make them sophisticated enough for a 5 and up child. My 3 year old granddaughter loves them too, but I think she will enjoy the extra features like the stick for hand movements when she is a little older. A good purchase for fun now and in the future."
3,NOT JUST FOR KIDS!,"THIS IS MY 5TH PUPPET IN THE MELLISSA AND DOUG SERIES.. MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND 8 YEAR OLD SON LOVE THEM! IT USES A LOT OF IMIGINATION AND WE PUT TOGETHER SHOWS FOR THE FAMILY, ALSO WE WORK ON MAKING ""TV SHOW"" SHORTS, TEACHING THEM DICTION, LEARNING LINES, AND HOW THE PROCESS IS FOR MAKING A TV SHOW, THEN WE VIDEO TAPE IT AND EDIT IT DOWN, THEY REALLY ENJOY THE PROCESS..MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT DURING SHIPPING THEY SHOVED IT INTO A SMALL BOX THAT SMOOSHED IT, BREAKING THE STICK. NO PROBLEM, I HAVE WOOD GLUE LOL!"
5,fantastic,the detail in the puppets are wonderful so pleased with them and the cost was so affordable. Melissa and Doug products never fail to amaze me
2,Woof!,"This puppet is plug ugly. Instead of a princess, I received a troll in a princess costume. She has a serious underbite -- the lower jaw is so full of stuff that it juts out and she looks like, well, a troll. It is really unfortunate, because she's part of the fairytale set that includes the king, queen (also not pretty, but better looking than her daughter), knight (he looks toothless and more like a fireman in a satin suit than a knight) and dragon (how come there's no prince?). The dragon is the best looking of the bunch. The princess and knight, though? Going back. (The seller is graciously permitting me to do a partial return for a pro-rated refund.) I simply can't justify giving these puppets as presents when I know they won't be played with. I found a prettier princess, though she's a glove puppet."
1,Princess Puppet,"I was very disappointed in the Melissa & Doug Princess Puppet. This is the first item received from Amazon I was unhappy with. There is something wrong with the construction of the mouth. My husband and I both tried to move the mouth up and down and it just doesn't work right. To be perfectly blunt, it looks deformed. At first, I felt like returning the Princess Puppet. Instead, I'm giving it to my 5 year old grand daughter, anyway; and she can decide if the puppet is a wicked, step-mother or a not-so-pretty princess. We can't all be beautiful. . .""No one is perfect."""
3,Liked it but....,"My daughter really liked the puppet, but we were disappointed that when I opened the package we found the wooden stick that you can use to hold up her arm broken. I didn't want to return it; so I am going to buy a replacement for that part at a craft store."
1,DVD do not work after 1 year,"After 1 year of ligth use, the drive will not read DVD's anymore! it cam read/burn CDs. but not DVDs..."
1,worked ok for about 4 months then won't burn,"I'v had my dru-720a for about 4 month and worked pretty well until about 2 weeks ago - now when burning a movie, single or DL, it either fails immediately or starts crawling at some point at 1% every hour or so (newer firmware didn't help). No, I didn't call Sony support - after doing some google research on Sony products in general and other user experiences with the 710 and 720 in particular, I saved my time and frustration and bought an Iomega. I am not happy about the number of (expensive) DL media coasters it's created. I'll never buy another Sony product."
3,Made hard drive light stay on,"After installing this drive in my case, whenever the drive was in use, my hard drive light would constantly stay lit. The drive itself seemed to work fine, but the light staying on annoyed me so I took it back and bought a Pioneer DVR-A09XL which works wonderfully. Also, the tray ejection motor sounded really weak, as if it could barely push the tray out."
5,Djembe doesn't get better than this.,"I first heard this CD six years ago. It's very hard to find, and it's understandable: the djembe and balaton playing are so amazing on this disc that it's hard to believe so few were released. My favourite is Kanarorobe, which - if I can remember the lyrics from that long ago - is a sweet lyrical song sung about dancing to the music of Kanarorobe: 'Anamati berema gombe la taqui yo, (ay! Allah!) Kanarorobe!' This is a great album."
4,Gamma! Finally on CD,I've been searching for years for the trifecta of Gamma albums on CD. These albums are a unique combination of hard/progressive/blues/pop rock done in Ronnie's own inimitable style. Brings back my high school days. Jump on these while you can!
4,Inspirational for the hip hop business person or doc filmmaker.,"I originally learned of this doc from the SHUT UP AND SHOOT documentary guide by Anthony Artis. It's an interesting and well made doc on the world of the hip hop entreprenuer. It's also a just plain inspirational look at independent business. You need to hustle in the changing economic climate. These folks are getting it done. Maxie Collier directed this flick. If you're into hip hop or need a fresh take on the world of independent biz, you need to check it out."
5,Great Read,"I knew I was toast when I read the first twelve words. There would be no putting this book down, written by an author who knows how to hook you from the first sentence and keep you all the way to the end. The impossible situations Ms. Hochstetler creates for Elizabeth and Jonathan keeps you turning pages, anxious for the next scene and yet dreading to see it all come to an end. Add to this mix the factual historical scenarios that show Ms. Hochstetler to be a knowledgeable historian and you have a great read. Don't start it until you have the time to devote to finishing it! Because you won't want to put it down."
5,History as it should be,"J.M. Hochstetler starts her publishing career with a winner! If only history class would have been half as interesting as her book! Ms. Hochstetler weaves history and fiction into an amazing tapestry that will excite you from the first roar of cannonball to the last scent of gunpowder. She also does a beautiful job of intertwining the faith thread of her characters as they struggle to follow God while their world turns to chaos around them. From the intrigues of Oriole and Patriot to the romantic tension of Elizabeth and Jonathan, you will be up until the wee hours for you won't be able to put this book down until you're finished. A must read for all lovers of historical fiction! I can't wait for the release of ""Native Son,"" Book Two in the American Patriot Series."
3,"Good war adventure, unconvincing on the romance","Daughter of Liberty is a mix of romance and adventure with a hint of mystery. The beginning of the war is accurately portrayed as a time fraught with high tension and utter confusion. Unfortunately, I'm not a big war aficionado, so for me the war scenes, which were likely the best part of the book, were at times tedious and boring. I also had a hard time seeing what Carleton and Elizabeth saw in each other from the beginning. It did not seem if there was much beyond good looks and charm to attract each other. Also, the moment of spiritual enlightenment between them seems out of left field and out of character."
4,Very Good Guide to WDW,"I purchased this book because I already had the Unofficial Guide to WDW 2004 (my WDW bible!!). But I must say this is a good guidebook in it's own right. While The Unofficial Guide is a little bit more review-oriented, Econoguide was a bit more fact and interesting tidbit oriented. I learned some fascinating facts about my fave rides and landmarks. This book would be good even if you're not planning on a WDW trip because of all the Disney facts in here as well as Universal Orlando too. And both guides do give you tips on saving money. Econoguide also has coupons in back--especially useful if you're not planning on all Disney, all the time. If you buy both books, you've got WDW and Universal covered! So I'd say if you're looking for opinions, defintely use ""The Unofficial Guide"" for some factoids, give ""Econoguide"" a try!"
5,Best book on Disney World ever,I really loved this book. It is written by an adult for adults. You csn appreciate that the author is a journalist. I depend on his observations every time I take my family to Florida.I have read all the others and none come close to the quality and accuracy you get with this guide. Check it out.
1,Buy a GOOD WDW travel book; NOT this one.,"I own every guide to WDW on the market, and this one is by far, the worst. I was very disappointed with it. I knew more about WDW BEFORE I read this. On one of his descriptions, he even has the INCORRECT height requirements for the ride, which to someone who is making a once in a lifetime trip, could make a huge difference! Pitiful resource. Buy the Passporter."
5,fabulous guitar work. one of my favorites,"Thoughtful, sometimes moody, occasionally eerie collection of Beatles tunes released for the 30th anniversary of the Beatles hitting the pop music scene. Includes some terrific guitarists (many who don't get all the airtime they deserve) playing their favorite cuts. These are all very interesting arrangements with a few inspired riffs and others so lovingly executed that they have obviously been considered over a number of years. Great driving music for a rainy night. Not a single slouch track on the disk. A sleeper."
5,New Age for Old Hippies,"Each interpretation adds abundantly to the original's charm, crafting it into a new entity altogether. Sometimes, you almost forget what you're really listening to...which after some 30 years, isn't so bad. The guitar work is excellent throughout. Although you can play this for almost any audience, I wouldn't recommend it for your teenagers. They just wouldn't understand."
3,The book received was in promised condition,except that it was very musty smelling and had to be aired for a while before it could be read. Other wise it was not representated and was in above average condition for a used book.
4,Every artist should own this,"I purchased this book for research and inspiration when I was designing a line of symbolic jewelry. I then found it to be inspirational for other art projects, and educational in the language of symbols. There are symbols from a broad range of cultures and usages. It got me thinking about the symbols we see every day, and looking at where they came from. It clarified some of the more arcane symbols I already knew to some extent. It introduced me to a lot of symbols I had never seen, or noticed, before. It will definately get you thinking and looking!"
1,NOT MADE IN THE USA! (as claimed),"Item I received is somewhat clearly marked Made in China in small print on the back of the blister pack. It is not shiny anodized aluminum, and while not magnetic, it is obviously painted silver, not nearly as shiny as the photo provided by Amazon. It is also much more flimsy than you might think from the photo, the aluminum is about as thick as a medium quality pie pan. The hinge doesn't fold back 90 degrees, so installing it might be a challenge (to get a screwdriver to properly grip the screws closest to the hinge end.Absolutely would NOT buy again."
4,Samurai William,"Giles Milton in Samurai William presents the story of a beautiful place full of culture and mystique and the Europeans who suit to use Japan as a resource for their own enrichment. William Adams, the man who opened Japan for the English and other European powers by using his influence over various Japanese officials to gain sweetheart trading deals. Using engaging prose and lively vivid descriptions that place the reader inside Japan as the Europeans enter, struggle against political and economic upheaval and eventually as the men leave Japan a defeated lot. It's a tale of men motivated by greed, men addicted to power in the case of some Japanese leaders, and even the blood lust that inhabits men that leads them to compel shoguns to evict Jesuits and then exploiting later religious and political divides in the drive for money."
5,An Excellent Read!,"""Samurai William"" is a great book! Giles Milton crafts a fascinating and expertly written account of William Adams, his mission to establish trade with Japan, and the adventures, clashing cultures, and mishaps along the way.With this book, Milton reinforces his skill at writing historical works that read like a great adventure novels. Milton's ability to do so is what makes his books so readable. The descriptions were vivid and captured my imagination without the help of the numerous pictures (which were very nice, too!) scattered throughout the book. I also felt emotional for the people in the book, instead of trudging through dull, lifeless characterizations like in a history book. All the things that made his previous books ""Nathaniel's Nutmeg"" and ""Big Chief Elizabeth"" great are in in full form here.I recommend this for anyone who enjoyed Milton's other works, or just picked this up on a whim! ""Samurai William"" does not disappoint."
4,On early adventuring & Japan,"This one got me. It is my favourite adventure of the three Giles Milton books I've read (inc. Nathaniel's Nutmeg and Big Chief Elizabeth). Milton continues to shock us with accounts of rowdy sailors, ruined adventures, terrible Dutch, Japanese samurai, and one very incredible life - that of William himself. As well as being for people interested in the adventures of early European seafarers, this book is certainly for those who have an interest in Japan. The account given of the Japanese of the period, and of the historic shift in Japan's system of power, is utterly intriguing and educational. The best part about the book was for me the depth with which Milton portrays these very hardy adventurers, the expertise with which he gives account of their exploits, and the detail with which he describes this most exotic country of the Orient. I enjoyed it all the way through and I could hardly put it down."
3,Rather Three-and-a-half Stars,"The writing is pretty good and the text of this book is good for anyone with absolutely no understanding of Japan and the early exploration of the North Pacific. It does paint a rather broad canvas. This is selective and course history -- the bits have been ripped out and pieced together to paint a rather gory and exciting tale. The book really holds your attention and it a rather quick and surprisingly light read --- in that sense it is also a good introduction to the early contact with Japan.If you like well written, light history, this will keep you turning the pages. If you are interested in using it as a starting point to dropping off in deeper reaches of exploration.I enjoyed it. I am not sure it is good history however. But if you read enough history, then this is not a problem."
3,A Period Piece,"Personally, I think this book suffers a bit of a personality disorder. The title is deceptive with Samurai William himself occasionally sidelined for what are probably more interesting developments that occured in Japan and the Orient at the time.I think Milton realised that, had he simply concentrated on his main subject, he wouldn't have much of a read. This is because the sources of info on Samurai William are fairly sparse. In order to develop the book into something readable a lot of other detail is included.Not to say that this isn't interesting. It is. We get to hear about various Europeans experiencing an extremely interesting period of Japanese history and get a pretty clear picture of the time.So, if you are a serious student of history focussed on William himself, this book is likely to disappoint. If however, as I am, you are a lover of Japanese history, you will benefit from a read of this."
4,Makes history exciting and accessible,"I found this to be a superbly written book, filled with fascinating details and enough excitement to fill a novel. Using quotes from contemporary sources, Milton brings history to life by focusing on the human elements rather than dry chronology. I can't wait to read the rest of Milton's books."
4,absorbing,"Did you know that James Clavell's ""Shogun"" was based on the story of an actual Westerner who had gone native in Japan in the early 1600's? I sure didn't.I thought Clavell was just spinning tales out of whole cloth. No, no; there really was a marooned Englishman there named William Adams, although as we learn from Milton's book, he wasn't quite as mixed up in high politics as was John Blackthorne.Milton relates Adams's intriguing story in the straightforward style of popular history. It is not written in the form of fiction; Milton here is writing for a large non-scholarly audience. There are no footnotes: Any references or Japanese terms the general reader probably can't handle are explained in the running text.In addition to an index, the book features several maps and black-and-white woodcut-type illustrations throughout the text."
5,"Too strange to be true, but it is","Samurai William is the surprisingly true story of the Englishman Clavell modeled Shogun after. It is a surprisingly interesting view of Pax Brittanica meeting fedual Japan. William is a very intresting character - perhaps the first who was able to sit atop both Japanese and Western culture and truly understand them both. His assistance in setting up a Japanese mission for a British company - well the challenges seem to describe the trials and tribulations of working in Japan today.If you enjoyed Shogun, this is definitely an interesting read. Even for those more modestly interesting in Japan, it is well worth your time."
3,Lacks Japanese sources,"I wish that the author had included Japanese sources. I would be interested in reading about the role of the Portuguese in Hormozd, Persia and how they were expelled with the aid of the English fleet. Also, Persia, after the enlightened reign of Shah Abbas I, went into a period of xenophobia.The merchant history of the East India Co. with respect to the Dutch East India Co. was what I found most informative."
2,An unexciting book lacks interest,"Considering the main character and story, the book ""Samurai William"" was remarkably dull. Though apparently well researched, it failed in one aspect, namely the somewhat anti-Catholic statements in the book regarding the Jesuits alleged plot to kill Adams. These statements were not referenced, giving no proof of the allegations. I doubt very seriously that the Jesuits would go about plotting to kill people.Considering the characters and the era, the book could not rise above the economic interests of the Europeans in Japan at that time. There was a great deal happening in Japan then which would have made the book far less dull. All in all I would pass on the book and watch Shogun (the long version)."
4,East Meets West...briefly,"This book is about a brief period in Japanese history (early 17th century) when the English, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese were all vying for special trading privileges with Japan, a society they found to be even more civilized than Europe (despite the cruelty of those in power). Using many excerpts from the writings of the men who lived in Japan, Milton describes the concerns of their daily lives, which included rivalries between Protestants (English & Dutch) and Catholics (Spanish & Portuguese), determining which European goods might sell in Japan, getting & staying on good terms with those in power, and seeking opportunities for pleasure and recreation. Milton also chronicles the foothold gained by Christianity in Japan due to the Catholic priests, and the horrific persecution of the Japanese converts which came later. A fascinating peek into the past."
4,Easy for learning but too many examples,"This book makes learning fairly easy with helpful cases to relate to the information. Each chapter has approximately 7 cases to make the content relatable. The cases also include titles that make it easy to know which term they relate to. One thing that makes it more difficult to get through the material is that they list far too many examples for the topics. For example, when they go through why a physician needs to be caring they list 12 to 15 examples instead of 1 or 2. It's almost like beating a dead horse."
4,No Complaints,Needed this for school.. I received this in great condition and it served the purpose for in which it was intended.
3,Happy customer,"I am happy with the book I purchased from Amazon.com. This was the first time I ordered a book on line and the experience was simple, and totally satisfying."
4,Law & Ethics,The book was delivered within 3 to 4 days in good condition. Great product for the price.
5,Law & Ethics Rates High,"The book was received within a few days in excellent condition. The book is set up well with vocabulary words emphasized, a review and short practice test included at the end of each chapter."
4,Harmonical!,"Another of the Breaux's jewelry. Being one of the lucky one's to go throught the Groovin experience, this last cd is great! The harmonica in it adds a great turn, making your mind not forget its lines, the whole cd has a great balance between moved songs and others more relaxed. Breaux experiences with programmed drums and otehr sounds and arrives into a totally new experience, which, as I said, adds to a perfect balance since now we have the kind of tunes that we could experience in Groovin' and others so fresh and new. Also introduces voices of chorus and even Breaux sings! Pay attention to Small Town in Texas, In the Midst of it All and the supergreat Midnight Cowboy! A must!"
5,Works Great,The band works great. The loop part just slips over the band and holds itself in place when you shut the ball part in the door. It seems very secure and doesn't seem like it would break.
5,"It is amazing, but I think this product really works!!","I breastfed my three boys for more than three years (the youngest is 2 now), so my breasts after the last one looked like those infamous ""rocks in the socks"". Not that I would be desperate because of that, they did great job :o), but they didn't look nice in the swimming wear :o). An augmantation hurts, and you have to maintain it, plus not everybody likes the result. So I encountered with this product by googling some breast enhancing stuff and Breast Actives significantly led all the reviews and tests. So I purchased them. Both Pills and Creams. After one month of using them, my breasts feel much firmer and fuller. Really! I can't say whether they will also grow a lot, but from size 34A I had to switch to 34B two weeks ago. So probably it is working on this field too. I recommend this product! Also I stopped having pain during my periods (I had two so far and I was surprised how smoothly I got through them)."
1,"Took them for 6 months, absolutely ineffective",I've taken this product for 6 months continuously as directed. I also use the cream diligently as well. It did absolutely NOTHING for me. Save your money and try something else.
1,Beware of the wording...,I was sent only a 1 month supply rather than a 6 month supply. Upon printing the return label it was worded 1 of a 6 month supply but the price definitely does not indicate this. I am unsure if this was a mistake or a rip off.
1,fake,"really it did nothiiiiiiiiiiiiing , it's my second month and no result at all....consume your money"
1,g78 Flash ships incorrect product,"Ordered an Iogear GFR202MSD. It is correctly identified on the invoice. Amazon's vendor, G78 Flash, shipped a different product.Seems pretty careless, as the product is clearly identified on the package as the wrong item.I will update after I see how they handle the complaint, but what a hassle to have to go through this."
4,Fast,"The other reviews here describe the reader accurately. I thought I might add the results of a simple speed test. I tested the reader with the SanDisk 8GB Ultra II Memory Stick PRO Duo, also sold here on Amazon, and results are:Reading: between 13 and 15 MB/s.Writing: between 9.2 and 9.7 MB/s.Average Access Time (using HD Tune 2.55): 2.1 ms."
1,Cheaply made,"This product works as advertised, but the construction, design and materials of the plastic housing are inadequate. Mine broke during the first week by merely opening the hinged door to the memory stick area.The plastic used to manufacture the housing is extremely brittle. Moreover, the hinges are made of the same plastic and are durable for only a few openings.Don't buy this product!"
3,"Works, but...","I found it somewhat difficult to use. It was hard to remove the memory card after use, and the hinged door was kind of sticky. It is a great size for carrying around in your briefcase, but for day-to-day use I would look elsewhere."
4,Very Useful,This was an affordable solution to put some life back into a couple of ms I had laying around. The product works great but it is a little cheap feeling and gets pretty hot. That being said I use it at my work computer all day long and have not had a problem yet.
3,Disappointed,"The jigsaw puzzle book was great until we got to the zebra page.Two pieces are missing. My 4 year old granddaughter noticed it right away and said we couldn't finish the puzzle because of the missing pieces.Otherwise, the rest of the book was in great shape."
1,Whatz up with the fish??,"Its like that scope deal with the army ... I installed them, was happy, pulled the ring up and there's a fish there?!? Not a trout or a bass ... nope its a Christian fish symbol. I posted a pic in the product description so see for yourself. I'm all cool with people posting printing or sticking whatever and wherever on their own stuff, but this is mine and they sneaked it in. I don't want any sneaky idolatry going on ... no stars of david, no wicca symbols, no islam, athiestic atom symbols, no nothing as its a tie down and life should be easy. And if I wanted one that had a little Harley Davidson symbol or something there, put it on the packaging so I know I'm getting extra and I might even pay extra for it. I returned em."
4,Great tiedowns for motorcycles,I bought these and they work fantastic in my F250 to hold down my dirtbikes. The only drawback I've found is that they can be hard to pull back up if they get sand or grit in them. Otherwise great! Best tiedowns I've found so far.
4,My Scene Car,"It's really cool. I just love it. But there is one thing that's kinda strange. It can only fit two My Scene's in it. Other than that I just love it. I think I like My Scenes better than Barbies. And it's really cool, cause the My Scene girls I have can switch heads. It's so cool, I just love it!"
5,Excellent Coverage,"Despite being a reprint of older photos, the text - written by a wartime Signal man - is a perfect accompaniement and this should not be considered merely a rehash. Color photography serves to bring the war to life, and this book is an excellent study of German uniforms and equipment, as well as the propaganda branch itself, desperate to paint victories overtop of continual defeats in the 1944-45 era. Recommended."
5,Great Production,"The musical content is SOLID, which would be expected from a post-Coltrane saxophonist. Sometimes we get the CD of guys that we are ""Supposed to like"" and we are very disappointed with the drum sound or the poor production of the album (RIGHT???)...That aint' happening here!!! The album has a very warm ACOUSTIC FEELING, straight ahead sound that we ALL can enjoy and love... GEORGE IS THE MAN!!!"
1,Inconsistent and faulty - a disappointment,"I bought this scale because we badly needed one, but unfortunately it did not even meet my expectations. The weighing scale is faulty, rarely works when you stand on it. It switches on only when you open the cell cover and press on it hard. Nowadays even that doesn't seem to do the trick and it is dead - this happened with the first 1 month of buying it.Further - the weight displayed are always different - you weigh 3 times within 10 seconds and you get 3 different weights.Very disappointed with this purchase."
4,Surprisingly accurate,"Easy to set up and use, as accurate for body fat percentage as hand-held models."
3,Love Italian Style...,"Sylvia Morell (Anita Ekberg) inherits a castle in the outskirts of the Italian countryside. Upon arrival, she is greeted by a strange, ultra-thin uncle, who tells her of her grandmother named ""Malenka"" -(this was also the movie's original title)-, sealed in the castle's underground crypt. Thankfully, the castle is also the home of a vampire babe in an eye-popping outfit! She's the sort of gal that could bite my neck any time! There are also two local barmaids, one of whom is afraid she's being turned into a nosferatu. Anyway, the rest of the movie is a confusing trainwreck. However, Ms. Ekberg, the vampire babe, and the two village barmaids made it all rather painless and somehow enjoyable! There's even a vampiric catfight!! Worth a look..."
1,Toothless,"In this 1969 film by Amando de Ossorio (Tombs of the Blind Dead) Ekberg plays an Italian fashion model who inherits a creepy Spanish castle, only to learn that her ancestors were vampires. The sets and costumes are beautiful, but can't compensate for the stiff performances, poor dubbing and slow pacing.Avoid Retromedia's DVD version. Even though it purports to be the 88-minute ""Americanized"" version of the film, it's only 74 minutes and appears to be an edited-for-television version.One and a half stars out of five."
2,Weak Italian Attempt at Vampires,A young woman on the verge of marriage discovers that she has inherited a castle and is now a Countess. She decides to visit her new land before her wedding. But once there she finds the castle inhabited by relatives who are vampires. Under a hypnotic thrall she sends word back to her fiancé cancelling the wedding. Fiancé is not put off and journeys to find out what is going on.Suddenly everyone is being attacked by vampires. The fiancé and a friend set out on a daring rescue with the local doctor.In the end the whole thing comes off a just silly. The final scene has one of the vampires chasing someone through the bright daylight with no ill effects. One gets the feeling that the film's creators were trying to reproduce the feeling of the Hammer vampire films but failed. The characters' motivations and emotions jump all over the place with little or no consistency. When done one can only wonder who would enjoy this film.
2,"St Clair's DVD ""Collector's Edition""","Ok, if this is a ""Collector's Edition"", I'd hate to see the standard edition- this is a sloppy release at best, with a very grainy image throughout. Also, the Amazon description says ""letterboxed"" - it's not. It's fullscreen. The title sequence is sort of letterboxed (though the credits are still cut off), but that's it.The Retrovision release is actually better image quality, though both releases seem to be edited for television. Retro's image is much less grainy and seems to have slightly better (more complete) full-screen image information."
2,Failed to deliver,"This movie started out with lots of potential but went downhill fast. These were the weakest vampires I have ever seen, the movie broke most of the ""vampire rules"", but on a good note plenty of eye candy."
3,Not Great,"I find this watch bulky, and not very comfortable. It is difficult to read, and the date is practically microscopic. It is MUCH easier to read in the dark when it is backlit."
3,I'M A WATCH!,"It IS a bulky watch. I would not recommend this if you have very thin wrists (like me) and are looking for something understated. However, if you like big jewelry this one is for you. I like it because it sort of screams ""I'M A WATCH"". And I like the back lighting; good for in the movies, if the lights go out, and nighttime re-conning. :o And as noted in the other review the date if teeny, so carry a calendar."
1,Only for aggressive actors,"I am always interested in art criticism and art promotion...these are rarely compatable. This book seems to be another promotion for someone who has so many fingers in so many ""professions"" that he can hardly call himself a full-time artist (whatever that means). I don't know if his art is any good or not; I've never seen it. But I do know that each artist makes their choice about how to run their life. I know lots of artists whose art has more energy, cognative depth and artistic merit than many of the so-called great artists who equate marketing with substance. Though there are some aspects of this book worth ruminating about, a better tale could have been told - that might be of help to other artists - if Rudd kept his ego out of this book....or is ego the name of his game?"
5,Great Gift!,"I bought these for my mother and sister and they were a hit. Very pretty, fair trade item, unique gift. Very pleased with this item."
4,Gun Tite on my paintball marker,"I have a RAP T68 paintball marker. The trigger was a little lose so I decided I needed some kind of Loctite to keep it locked up and tight. I researched and found out that Gun Tite from Uncle Mike's is equivalent to Loctite blue, which is one level below red (which is permanent). I've used it and had it dry and it works great. The trigger is super tight. I haven't used it in game, but as far as just pulling the trigger for testing and test firing, it works well. I would recommend this if you need to get a bolt locked up or anything similar."
4,it's Glue..,I can't say a whole lot here. This product was well packaged in plastic form mold. It is adequate in all ways.
4,good product,They say you can get the blue or the purple loctite for this application. I just wanted to be sure I had the right stuff. I was glad to find this labled for use as guntite. Now I am sure I am not wrecking my barrel or mount. All I need is to break a screw and have to butcher the barrel.
1,Awful,"A hot air balloon crashes into an island occupied by an ancestor of Dr. Frankenstein - yes, it's as bad as it sounds."
1,Spending Like Lynn,"This book may be helpful for women who have never travelled alone, but note: bring your credit cards! Suggestions such as hiring a driver to take you on a private tour of the city and taking cabs everywhere not only tend to insulate you from the very culture you travelled so far to experience, but are also simply not practical/financially possible for many people - women or no. Hotel and restaurants are also mostly in upper-moderate to expensive range. The tone is not that of an empowered female traveler taking care of herself, but more that of one seeking to protect herself from all possible mishap by playing it safe. Finally, I found the content extremely skimpy for the price. Guess if you have the money to travel as Lynn does, this would not be a concern."
4,Caillou and the holiday season,"My 3 year old daughter, Rachel, loves this video. She has watched it several times. It deals with Halloween as well as Christmas and she enjoyed it as much as she does the shows on tv. She liked the little game on the dvd also. Dressing Rosie to go outside. She squealed and giggled through the entire video. If your little one likes Caillou, buy this."
2,Calliou's Holidays,"Caillou Holiday didn't work, probably my fault not taking the time to return or tell them about it. I'm sure they just didn't realize this DVD was not working. I thought it was a new one? Grandbabies were disappointed!"
2,Damn Puppets...,This video has those damn puppets... so we have to fastforward through those parts and you get less Caillou. Very frustrating
2,dont buy,"I wish I would have read the reviews first. This has lots of puppets and less caillou. I did buy Caillou the creative and that one is back to back episodes and no puppets. Also if your child likes Caillou, I would recommend Caillou's Holiday Movie. My 20 month old loves that one!"
4,DVD is twice as long as VHS,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE --VHS-- VERSION (Amazon will put it on both listings)(the DVD version gets 5 stars)My daughter loves Caillou (and tolerates the puppets - but that is not a big deal).I like him myself - much better than Dora, clearly better than the Berenstains and Clifford (though they are closer).This is a 40 minute tape. The DVD version is 80 minutes. Probably more expensive but you get twice the Caillou!"
4,Good old rock-n-roll,"OK, I admit that I only bought this CD because Nikki Sixx plays bass on it. And I sure am glad that I did. This CD rocks. It sounds like a modern version of Motley Crue with an almost industrial type sound. The guitar playing is superb, and of course Nikki rocks! Most importantly, the songs are great!! If you like hard rock and don't mind in your face lyrics, give this a chance. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Not impressed,I was totally not happy with this DVD. It's kind of boring and I hated the voice overs. The chick that was reading Jackie's diaries was so lame. Don't waste your money on this one. I wished it had more pics of Jackie instead of scenery pictures of Rhode Island and Virginia and DC and NYC. I wouldn't recomend it.
5,Revelation,"When I purchased this cd i was suffering from a deep depression, without knowing the meaning of the chant, I played it every morning and prayed that I could find a solution to my suffering. This mantra directed me to the solution and after three years of being in deep depression and anxious I am now beggining to feel alive again and have energy, I play it every chance i have especially in the morning and it enlightens my soul, miraculous things begin to happen _ Namaste!"
3,The Title Says It All !!!,"This movie is pretty dumb but if you go into expecting nothing more than a little zombie fun, it's a winner. Mostly it plays for laughs and it delivers. There are a few scenes that made us laugh out loud. Chopper Chicks is NOT a film that every true zombie fan needs to own but it's worth a rental."
1,Chopper Chicks in Zombietown,I have purchased a number of biker exploitation movies and this is the worse. My friends who were invited for a boys night out won't even speak to me now. It is a wonder how the producers spent so much to produce this DULL movie. The budget alone for the new Sportsters must have been a fortune. How Billy Bob Thornton ever had a major career after this movie is hard to believe. Mercifully for him he was killed off early.
1,Why did Troma pick this movie up?,"Chopperchicks in Zombietown, what an awesome title eh? i really expected way more. let it be known that i am an avid troma fan and know what troma fans like. i bought this movie on a whim because the title sounded so cool, i really wish i hadnt bought it. if youre a billy bob thorton fan, dont even bother his part isnt that big. the movie was just downright boring. if you want a good troma movie get tromeo and juliet, the toxic avenger, or an out of house production like killer condom. this movie is a true disappointment and i wish i could give it no stars at all."
5,i loved this movie!,"""chopper chicks"" was a great movie! it was one that i had a great deal of difficulty finding... i actaully wanted to see it, because the new host of talk soup,hal sparks, is in it. after seeing it once, i soon wish to purchase it! hal played a blind orphan named lance. it was a really cool movie! i recommend it to anyone!"
3,Chopper Chick in zombie town,"What a sorry movie this is,not even zombie fans wouldn't want to see this trash!~this movie should of been call the stupid Zombies in tromaville,peep this out this movie had blind kids in the movie taking on zombies? talk about stupid! This movie did have some pretty good make-up and some of troma's famous gore,but the story and the acting was just too right down bad.This movie should not be in a Horror Section,Troma is in a class of there on,Tromaville Section with your host the Toxic Avenger and Sgt.Kabuki Man N.Y.P.D"
3,One of TROMA's better efforts...,"Most Troma films are infamous for being badly made and corny and very gross. But surprisingly this film was slightly better. It stars a few known faces and in particular Ed Gale (who portrayed Chucky in some secenes in the 'Child's Play' movies) a gun-totting dwarf! Bizarre, funny and unique. You may be pleasently surprised."
4,Very nice,"With a name like ""Chopper Chicks in Zombietown"" it should be good...and it is. It was alot better then I expected it to be. After all it has alot of the essential elements that make a good movie- a dwarf, cheezy music and effects, blind kids, biker chicks, and meat-eating zombies. What more could you want? And Hal Sparks (gotta love the guy) always seems to get the best lines in all of his movies, such as ""A dwarf, blind kids, d*kes on bikes- we could start a side show!"" Anyway, this movie is definatley worth atleast a rent. Enjoy!"
4,Much better than I expected,"My husband bought this while I was on vacation, and after reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned. However, now that we have been using it for several months I am much more at ease with it. Our bedrooms are right over the garage and in the winter (we live in NE Ohio) they get extremely cold. He set the thermostat to keep the garage at 50 and the bedrooms have been much more comfortable this winter. We both have hobbies which require garage workbenches, and it quickly warms the work area when we turn it up. He even installed a ""kill switch"" so it turns off when the garage door opens, and we are not heating all of Stow. Overall very pleased."
2,lousy technical service,"purchased 2 Mr. Heater NG 25000BTU, the very 2nd week, one of the heater was not working, contacted the manufacture, and found out thermal coupling was bad, called the mfr. to see how to install, well, frankly put on hold and still holding. I am about to return both of the heaters."
1,don't buy it!,"because you can order it for free, or download it, directly from the nation deceived website. just google ""a nation deceived"""
5,Blue -eyed soul starts here,"This CD is a must have for fans of soul music. The Boogie Kings are legendary in Louisiana and parts south, and the rest of the world should check them out to see why. Gee Gee Shinn and Jerry (""Count Jackson"") LaCroix are unforgettable vocalists, the horn section is rich and warm, and the rhythm section is solid. Listen to ""Cryin' Man"", the electrifying ""Funny How Time Slips Away"", and the tender ballad ""Lonely Room"" for a taste of what these fine musicians can do. If you can locate them, try to get their following records on the Montel label. ""Blue Eyed Soul"" is equally as good as this record, and ""Live at the Bamboo Hut"" is the best live record you will ever hear. This band continues to perform excellent music today, and their newer releases are available. But during the 1960s with the Montel sessions they were at their peak, and you shouldn't let another day go by without hearing why."
4,Poetic primal screams,"I was really impressed by ""What It Wasn't,"" the poetry collection by Laura Kasischke. The author has a vivid literary voice. Her poems are often nightmarish, sensual, and/or surreal; the book is full of bizarre, unsettling imagery. Her preoccupation with death is reminiscent of the work of Poe.Here are some samples of her vision. ""The moon tonight is red as something / too sweet and full of female screams to eat"" (from ""Andy's Lanes & Lounge""). ""How skinny the Cornish hen / appears in the oven. / A plucked, baked, feminine / fist"" (from ""Woman in a Girdle""). In another poem she describes the moon as ""a blind blue infant face"" (""My Heart""). Also remarkable is the title poem, which recalls a paranormal encounter with a fantastic bird. Although I didn't always find the poems totally coherent, Kasischke's voice is consistently compelling, and this book is definitely worth reading."
3,Need more choices in color,I wish that they sold Black/brown or off Black color even velvet Black. The darkest Brown is not dark enough.You have to leave it in longer and this is not good for the hair. This is the reason i wanted to buy just 5 so that i don't have to leave it in my hair because it can damage the hair.
1,Apex is full of thieves,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. They do not care about the consumer and based on my past 1.5 years of experience there is virtually nothing we can do about it but stop buying their products.Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
2,APEX Customer service BAD,"Hi,We purchased a new APEX TV/DVD Combo and the remote was missing, so we thought no problem just buy a new remote... WRONG! We looked all over no one has one, we ordered one, and since last year we are still being told it's on backorder,, all eveyrone can say is they are on backorder! APEX has miserable customer service! of course they refuse to tell customers that the %%%$$#$ is going on!"
1,You can do better!,"In the last two weeks, I've had two of these units. The first one's DVD drawer died about 8 days in; the second unit wouldn't play DVDs--it either said ""No Disc"" or froze about 15 seconds in. While I liked the display, and that the unit will internally dub a video from non-copyrighted DVDs, I had lost faith in the manufacturer. Good thing I wasn't paying shipping and just had to take them back to the mall! I'm happy with the new Toshiba SD-V392 I got for just a little more money."
1,This machine is a night mare,"The 1st unit we received was broken on the DVD side. After exchanging hassle and shipping back. The new unit starts breaking after 6 months. The DVD quality sucks, VCR has never worked right....Do they have a negative star rating?"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS EQUIPMENT,"I purchased this device two weeks ago (May 26, 2004) from SEARS and straight out of the box, the DVD player does not play ANY DVD! I burn DVDs in many different formats (DVD-+RW) from different manufactures and none of them play. Then I tried to play a regular DVD (Anthony Robbin's Get the Edge) and it also will not play. I tried several other brand new DVDs and none will play. I even tried playing MP3 and WMP discs, with no luck. I knew I should not have purchased this product without researching it first but I was in a time crunch. I do not recommend this product! And I waited over 10 minutes trying to speak with a customer service rep, which is also unacceptable!"
1,This item does not work!!!!,"I paid $99.99 for this item at Sears, within months, while watching a DVD on it, it stopped showing a picture. The sound works for the DVD but no picture. The VCR part still works, picture and sound, but DVD only plays sound.Completely USELESS!!!"
1,Junk!,"I bought this as a gift for my grandson, and it failed on the first attmpt to use it - swallowed a VHS tape and would neither play nor eject it. The design concept is good, but quality control seems to be non-existent. Back to Sears it goes, and shame on them for carrying the line."
1,DVD Broke in 2 weeks,"Item broke 2 weeks after I got it. I went to Iraq and couldnt return after I returned. Apex is and will always be bottom of the line products. Leave this product in stores, Seller shipped promply nothing against him, Product brand has very low quality."
1,Do Not Buy!,"When we first received the player, the VCR door would not shut completely. Considering this was such a cheap product, and the fact it did not effect the VCR playback, we figured it was something we could live with. Now, three months into owning this, the DVD player has stopped working completely! We're now in the process of retuning this piece of crap. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else!"
2,"Nice Features, poor quality sound.","This Apex seems to be a fine unit, except the sound quality on the DVD side is quite poor. Quality otherwise has been good, unlike some of the previous reviews. Have they improved these, or did I just get a good one?"
1,Don't be fooled,"I bought this machine on 9/8/03. It is 12/14/03 and the dvd is no longer functioning; used it once. Apex on-line customer service doesn't exist... I wanted to chose no stars, but you can't.Overall the machine is not good. The VCR only records at SP or SLP. The picture quality is terrible on super long play. On screen record doesn't have auto turn-off (for example can't set it to record for 1 hour without pre-programing it).I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Don't be fooled by the price,"I bought this product because of the price. I learned you get what you pay for.I had to return the first one becase it was ""Defective"". Apex made me pay to ship it back to the tune of 24.00. When I finally received the replacement it to had the same defects as the first one. Noisey when the VCR is running, display features showing on screen randomly and loud mechanical sounds on loading and unloading the VCR. Dealing with the manufaturer was no picnic either. Stay away from this product their are better DVD/VCR products coming down the road."
1,"Mitchell froom sinks Gamma, Mach 1","""Gamma 3"" was a failure for the same reason that Joe Satriani's ""Engines Of Creation"" was a failure.People don't buy Ronnie Montrose albums...whether they're under the banner of ""Montrose"" or ""Gamma""...to hear artificial, cold, computerized synth riffs.People don't buy Ronnie Montrose albums to hear Mitchell Froom. They didn't buy Satriani's ""Engines of Creation"" to hear Eric Caudieux.Gamma 3 failed for two reasons: First, the extreme amount of control that Ronnie handed over to Mitchell Froom. Second, there are no memorable songs. NONE.I really can't understand why some people gave this turkey five stars."
2,t-mobile k1,"the t-mobile k1 phone sucks. i hated it. i didnt have signal practically anywhere i couldnt send or recieve pictures at all, if you want to get this phone ask to try it out first before making a decision. so i got rid of it."
1,If only I could give zero stars ....,"I bought this phone when I switched services, since I've had such good experience with other Motorola phones. This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand. The battery life is abysmal, and I have lost more calls in the two months I've owned this phone than I did in one year with other phones. I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem. Being able to play music is overrated, since in order to do so you have to separately purchase their music software and linkage package, plus set up a separate music program. I am making an unprecedented move and buying a new phone way before I qualify for the upgrade with my plan. What a waste of money."
3,Some defects,"The krzr looks pretty sleek, but i find it a bit bulky. Though it's slim, it's kind of thick and long. I used to have a razr, which i find less bulky because it was flatter.I don't know if it's just a defect in my krzr, but I can't navigate through the phone book. When I punch in a ""m"" the phone doesn't do anything, and I'd have to scroll all the way down the phone list.The one thing that's pretty sweet about this Motorola is that you can have multiple numbers for one person (unlike all the other Motorola phones). To deal with the lack of navigation, I assigned each of my numbers to a group, which helps me get to a number faster.Besides that little defect, I think that the krzr is okay, but i think i like my razr more."
1,"faulty item, speaks in french","i bought this phone from them, i was sooo excited because i use my phone for work and my current phone is a POS and it has stopped working, so i opted for overnight shipping, the phone arrived as described, i plugged it in and inserted my SIM card, only to find out that my screen doesnt work, it makes phone calls, but i cant see anything. i pressed the buttons on the side thinking it might be the contrast only to find out its yelling at me in french! i went to the website to find a customer service phone number, but to no avail, i had to email. so i hope i can get this straightened out and get a working phone. this experience has left me without a phone."
4,Good no frills mobile phone,"I switched from the RAZR to the KRZR because of the more narrow design. It's pretty much the same phone in different packaging. I've had no problems with the KRZR. The only complaint is that when I have it on vibrate mode and it's in my pocket, I don't feel it vibrate at all."
2,regular sd card doesn't fit,watch out for this add as you think that it is unlocked and will work just fine--read the entire description as the sd card is a mini and won't work with most carriers! Returning tomorrow.
2,Krazr not that good on features. Get V3xx/Maxx,Sure the phone looks cool but the V3xx razor blows this thing away specification wise. Why the Goforce 4800GPU was not included in this phone is beyond me. Also why is there a measly 66mhz processor in this when the V3xx/Maxx have a 247mhz(Arm9)? The screen is a smaller resolution QCIF compared to the QVGA of the V3xx too. I mean the only upside I could see it the 2MP camera on this phone. It also only supports EDGE which the V3xx supports the much faster 3G HDSPA/UMTS. If you are big on fashion and not specs then this is the phone for you. A much better phone would be the V3xx 3G phone or wait for the Krazr K3. One last not why is this thing still called a razr? It is not thin and that is the point of the razr phones.Look at the jbencmark comparison's[...]
1,Not Recommend To Buy This Phone,"I ordered the phone last week, and it came this morning. I was very happy for the fast delivery. However, when I opened the box, it looked really cheap to me. The phone was in a old package. Even the phone looked old, and there're scatches on it. Inside the package, there're only a phone, a battery, a back cover, a charger and a old Cingular manual. The phone looked like a refurbished one because the tiny screws on the back was loose. I had to use the screwdriver to fix them. It cost $145 plus tax last week, and it dropped down to $139 plus tax this week. So I already got $6 lost!!!!"
2,Were's the internet?????,"Im not real happy with my moto k1, nobody told me it come's from Hong Kong, and it won't connect to the internet. What's up with that?????"
1,DO NOT BUY - THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK IN THE US,"This phone DOES NOT work in the US. The phone is from Hong Kong and the software inside is for that area and networks. I spoke directly with Motorola and they said there is nothing you can do but, return the phone."
1,KRZR K1m recall,"I have not used this phone yet. However, I just ordered the KRZR K1m (CDMA) from Alltel (through our corporate sales outlet)and a few hours later, the sales person called to advice this model has been recalled and will be re-released about a week later. Apparently, Motorola has heard the complaints noted in some of the reviews here. I hope this helps anyone considering buying one of these phones."
1,MotoKRZR,"I bought this phone for it's beautiful color and design and am happy with it for the most part. I also have a MOTO RAZR and have been comparing the two. So far the main thing I don't like about the KRZR are the voice dialing.With the RAZR, you can train each person with a Voice Name in the phonebook. Then press the right button and say the name, and it automatically dials that person.The KRZR has no such feature (at least I haven't found it yet) and does not seem to recognize names, and if it does, you have to press several buttons before it will dial the correct person. Not exactly what you need if you are trying for hands-free dialing.The other negative feature when compared to the RAZR is that is actually feels heavier and the controls are smaller and harder to use with my big fingers.Other than that, probably a great phone. I'm still trying to figure out what it can do, so am having a learning curve issue."
1,Slightly defective,"I needed a cheap phone to tide me over till my contract expires. I've always had good luck with Motorola products previously, but i suspect the mouthpiece on the phone i got is defective. Nobody can understand a word i say into the phone unless i plug in my ear-bud and speak into that, in which case everyone can hear me OK.Also the phone's mini-sd memory-card reader seems incapable of even recognizing when it has a memory card inserted.The only reason I didn't return it is because i didn't want to be stuck without a phone for another week, and it (mostly) works as long as i use it with the ear-bud."
1,cheap glass,"I have used one of these cell phones, a similar one, for three years. It is a great phone in many respects.And small - nothing worse that lugging big heavy cell phone around.However this version, instead of the plexiglass front of my original phone, has a cheap piece of glass on front! Not safety glass, cheap window pane! This glass front shattered in the first month I used it. How could they make it like that????worthless"
1,Throwing it out!,"I purchased this phone the last of May '08 and wasn't really concerned when it had no warranty. I figured it would last a while. After about 2 months, it started acting strange and dialing the number 2. A week went by and my calls wouldn't connect - even with 5 bars of signal. Another week and it said ""Emergency Only"". I have researched the issues on the internet and contacted AT&T tech support but nothing worked. It was a waste of money. The moral of the story? Don't buy this phone without a warranty!"
1,Last 3 months only.,"I bought it in February, and it was good for 3 months only; now I understand why it is being sold under "" No warranty"".Still don't know why it suddenly, after 2 hours of non-use or stand-by, the screen turns on white,and never change until I took out the battery. One night I forgot to turn it off, and the next day It did not work at all. Not even turn on! First I thought It was the battery, then I tried with another one, waste of money! Of course.This phone sucks, I have seen other reviews, It looks to me that I'm not the only one."
3,unsure,"I bought the KRZR last Saturday. The same evening, my screen began blanking out. My screen was very dark and seemed to have some sort of shortage. I took the phone back to my cell phone company to have it replaced. As I was waiting, another customer came in with the same exact problem!Its a great phone with awesome features! My advice is to wait and see if there is a recall on these phones since its so new!"
4,cell phone,"I purchased this k1 for my daughter. every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it. I want to buy one more for myself,but the price went up.Very good phone at the price."
4,"nice phone, great price","The phone is very nice and at an excelent price. Menus aren't ideal, but it handles blue tooth well. Since I had an international sim card, the phone book didn't give much options (only one number/name and no voice dialing) ... not sure if that would be different with a standard GSM plan. Note that the phone comes with a UK power adapter, but as it works on both 120 and 240 V all you need is a basic plug adapter which I had. Of course if you travel in Europe you need the adapters anyway, so it doesn't matter much. Camera on the phone takes nice pictures too."
3,Motorola KRZR K1,"I purchased this phone about a week ago and I am very disappointed with it. The front of the phone is made out of glass and I happed to drop my phone a whopping six inches, from my hand to the counter and the glass cracked/shattered. The battery is decent and will make it through the day but you will most likely have to charge the phone frequently. Oh and texting on this phone is a joke, and the bottom left key does not always respond when pressed.GOOD-Reception-Design-Speaker phoneBAD-Slow OS-Battery-Build quality-Menu structure-MP3 player software"
1,do not buy,"Yes, it looked fancy and pretty. what's why I bought this.but it's not like old best-seller razor models.If you google this model, you will find out that this model is not durable.lots of case, people experienced error that display turn to white. My krzr is broken in 4 months. Its LCD turn to white blank permanently and never came back. also when you use menus or look up phone book, you will experience delay. You may be able to stand it, but there are many other phones work better.my conclusion is, its appearance is cool but not durable."
1,Sorry Phone,Sorry product you can only make calls you cant send text its a phone that isnt under US warranty but sold in the US From HONGKONG so no one can help ya and if you continue to use it then you SIM gets locked dont waste your time or money I am still waiting on my REFUND
1,"Beautiful phone, if only it would have worked.","I received the phone two days ago and remarked on the beauty of it and its overall good design. After charging and setting the phone up I was pleased so far. The next morning I started to go to work, picked the phone up and it shut off completely. After trying many things to fix the problem it was useless. Tried to contact the the seller, Exotic phones.con which is listed by Amazon, I think I been had. The phone only left my house once, in a box."
3,Nice phone BUT!,Nice phone BUT! It is an international phone it will not access internet after several calls to AT&T Wireless and Motorola. Motorola finally said they cannot configure it to access the internet since it is an international phone. Charger has a European plug. Found that I can order a charger seperate.
4,I love it!,I got this phone just recently because I wanted a new phone and I couldn't wait until I'm due for upgrade. I love it! Everything works fine the only thing I'm disappointed of is I cannot access Internet or media net because it's unlocked. I've checked with my Provider and they said they couldn't do it because it's unlocked. All in all this phone works great!
5,Sweet phone with minor caveat,"I've had this phone for 3 days now, and I am extremely happy. My previous phone was a Motorola RAZR, which recently met its maker. The KRZR has stronger signal and better reception, and automatically worked when I put in my Cingular SIM card and powered it on. Its dimensions are similar to the RAZR, and is more visually appealing. My wife already wants one for herself.The only caveat is that this phone is from Hong Kong. Everything is in English, except the java games (which include Sandoku and some kind of English to Cantonese translator)."
3,These types were not well built.,"These types were not well built, Motorola had made good phones and I stuck to them for a good while but have not bought any other Motorola since the disappointment of this phone."
1,The phone and charger do not work properly,"The original charger never charged properly so I was able to get a replacement. The replacement charger never worked either, so I found an charger from an older Motorola phone and have been able to get by with it. Then comes the problem with the phone. I have never been able to use a wire headset with it. There's so much static noise with the wire headset connected that people on the other end can't really hear me. Now that even without the headset of speaker on, people cannot hear me with the bad quality of the sound almost everywhere even with the best reception area."
4,Almost perfect,"Received the phone from the Cingular folks. Had a RAZR V3 before this, and like the slimmer body and upgraded styling. As a non-tech type, operating the thing wasn't as intuitive as I would have liked, I had to refer to the manual many times to set it up and surf the web to figure out how to get it to work with Mobile Phone Tools. The best thing about it is the style and provision of basic phone functions (calling, camera, e-mail and music) without being a big behemoth treo-like organizer. I still cannot figure out how to save pictures and videos to the micro SD, the phone says there isn't enough space, but there is. A few other bugs too, hopefully there will be more support and info on the web in the months to come."
5,Motorola KRZR,I have been using my Motorola KRZR for more than a month now and I am satisfied with its variety of features.
1,Poor Quality,The back of unit has cheap clips. One of the clips broke after changing the 'new' battery twice that wouldn't charge. Another junk product from Motorola.
5,love the krzr,"This is my second KRZR. I love this phone. I finally broke my first one, but I pushed it to the limits. It had been washed, soaked jet skiing, dropped, kicked, chewed up by my dog (twice) and finally destroyed by me trying to replace pieces without the right screwdriver. This phone lasted through it all. The best feature is that if you dry it out after immersing it in water, it still works. If you are hard on phones, I would recommend this one."
3,Good but flawed,"My unlocked KRAZR came from Germany, which after setting it to English went fine. However, the time was wierd, so I reset it to US EST -- it still won't hit the tower time when in other time zones. What's with that???Sometimes it doesn't ring (it's set to a loud ringtone, not vibrate, etc) when called, but will beep 'missed call' as it should -- still working on that one. No headphone jack, only bluetooth -- I can live with it. Other than that, love the design and color... but wouldn't recommend."
2,faulty,"Worked OK except the small outside screen wouldn't light up, and plastic on outside of a second one I bought came un-glued. Have sent the one for replacement but haven't recieved it yet. Probably should have sent other one back also instead of glueing it back together. Would not buy this phone again!"
2,Only good for a year!,"If you plan to keep this phone a year or less - I do recommend it. But if you want one for longer than that - forget it.My mom and I each had one. And both of them after almost exactly a year of use started crapping out. First all the functions became very delayed. Then the battery completely gave up. I would charge the phone over night and after making one call in the morning, I'd be down to two bars. Another call over 1 minute long and the phone starts beeping ""low battery"". Note that the exact same issues were happening on both of these phones so it is not my bad luck on one particular faulty phone.Owning this phone past 1 year has been a torture and Morotola customer service didn't seem to give a damn. I'm exchanging it in the next week or so and this experience has made me steer clear of Motorola phones alltogether."
3,"Good Phone, No Software with Unlocked version","It is a good phone, sound is clear, signal is good. Looks very sleek. You will find it difficult to fit it in any cell case available in stores as it has unusual dimensions. You can ofcourse find a pouch online. Motorola does not provide any Software CD with the phone. I am unable to connect to my laptop using bluetooth. Motorola sells the software CD seperately.Front looks like a glass plate, attracts finger prints and can crack easily if struck with anything heavy or sharp.Camera is good. It has 8x digital zoom but the quality is only good upto 2X zoom (after all what else can you expect from digital zoom)."
2,Boring Motorola,"Seriously, I dont recommend this phone. . . the only good thing is its looks. its all show and no go. . . I bought it because i broke my old phone (nokia 5300) but this phone was so bad i decided to go back to my broke phone.. which I now fixed. This phone also has horrible functionality as far as mp3 players go. the speed of navigation is horrible because of horrible layout and the fact that the processing capabilities are horrible(waayyyyy too slow)Im giving it two starts one for the sleek look, and one for the 2mp camera, which you can still find on ALOT of other phones."
2,KRZR K1 My Review,"This product is nice and okay but not as friendly as I expected like other cell phones especially my Sony Erickson W580I that I lost! Why is it they were in Thai language when we are using this in America! We are english-speaking people and not Thai nor Chinese. I was really very disappointed and would like to return the item once I found another that will fit my taste. If they were manufactured from China or Thai (notice the keys!) Doing texting, if not set your, text would be in Thai! I will not recommend to friends --- anyways AT&T; offices told me they no longer support this type of Motorola phone and stop selling them!I look so awkward with this phone!"
3,Retromedia version has good technical quality,"The Retromedia version offers an excellent anamorphic transfer. DVDs for many campy public-domain films look like they're taken from TV prints that have been dragged behind a truck, then run through VHS twice. Retromedia clearly had access to a clean 35mm print and made a modern digital transfer. It looks and sounds far better than expected for this kind of title--about what you'd get from a major studio with honest technicians and a good vault copy. Given the age of the film and the likely budget, we're probably seeing everything there is to see."
3,Desde Tacuarenbo,"Supe de Zitarrosa desde que comenzó a cantar en público en 1971, aproximadamente. Le seguí escuchando todo el tiempo hasta que le ví en México, asilado, en 1980.Siempre me impresionó lo profundo de su voz y el compromiso con su pueblo oriental hasta que se murió allá por el año 1988. Parecerá ocioso decir que aún vive, pero es así. Sus canciones forman parte de la historia popular latinoamericana. Reflejan fielmente la ebullición social de los años setenta.No tenía idea de la existencia de este disco hasta que le compré y me felicito por tenerlo. Oirlo te transporta al remanso previo al auge del neoliberalismo y la globalización. Te transporta al pasado romántico de una generación que creyó en el cambio y el triunfo de la justicia por encima del poder del capital."
1,Poor quality,Poor quality video. This documentary does not share the usual PBS production values and the story is quite disjointed. Would not recommend this film to anyone.
3,good,"very good material for a proyector (infocus in76). you don't need more if you use only for image. for audio and image I recomend the audioquest x. reegretspdt.: sorry for my bad inglish, i'm from chile."
2,"eh, save your money","if you have a curriculum you need to follow, save your money. Just OK but doesn't tie into what we use."
3,I don't reccomend this book.,"I would have given the book a lower rating but it was only bad because it was so bland. The author assumes that the reader is a seven-year-old and about 20% of the book is baby-talk. It doesn't go into much detail about training. In fact, ""The Hamster Handbook"" by Patricia Bartlett (also sold at amazon) goes into as much detail about training a hamster. This book doesn't include much other information about hamsters other than obvious things and is mostly vague. I don't recommend this book, but highly recommend ""the Hamster Handbook."""
2,Now superseded,"I have used this textbook and earlier editions in undergraduate teaching and in consulting work several times over the last 20 years. While I considered it only adequate, I could not find a suitable replacement for these situations (Cochran and Särndal et al. would be good for a graduate course).I have now experimented with Sampling: Design and Analysis 2nd Ed. by Sharon L. LohrSampling: Design and Analysis (Advanced Series)and I have found that it completely supersedes Scheaffer et al. from all points of view. In my opinion Lohr's book and Survey Methodology 2nd ed, by Robert M. Groves et al.Survey Methodology (Wiley Series in Survey Methodology)create together an outstanding and up-to-date resource for the teaching and practice of survey sampling."
3,Nothing Special,This book gives practical guidelines and does a half decent job of explaining the various estimators. Unfortunately the text had frequent typos along with typos in the formulae! Further there was a lack of proper derivation of formulas.
3,Technical Language,"I bought this book for the good name of the publisher and because it was a cheaper book they put out. I was saddened that within only a couple of pages the book became technical with how to write functions for instance that I personally am not used to. I am not a Math Major, only Computer Engineer. I was able to do much of the math already regard to these pages, but I could still not understand the author due to his way of writing functions. For instance he commonly uses the ""mapping to"" style if I recall, which is not a big deal, but it gets a little more annoying as time goes on. Perhaps with more time I could get through it, but my patience is much shorter just trying to understand what the author is saying besides understanding the math."
5,Exploring Horizons The Adventurer's Playground -- Bled Slovenia,Now I know why people like Madeline Albright come to Bled. I'll be sure to visit there in October. What a beautiful place!!!
3,Not for Kits,"This is a great collar, with a sturdy bell and it's well made... however, it is a bit on the large side and should NOT be used for kits. I used it for a young male, he promptly removed it under the couch, and proceeded to eat half of it after only ten minutes from being put on.It would be fine for fully-grown ferrets, however."
2,an extremely disappointing work,"While one certainly can't expect the history of Byzantium to be dealt with exhaustively in a 300+ page book, this book falls seriously short of Oxford University Press's typically high standard. 12 contributors' work make up this compilation of articles on the history of Byzantium. Most of the articles seem rushed and many are tedious to read (this coming from someone fascinated by the subject.) Additionally, many of the authors write in a condescending tone. There isn't a footnote or endnote to be found, although there is a chapter by chapter bibliography. I would seriously consider looking elsewhere for books on the subject, especially considering the price."
2,Oh Well they tried to do a very hard subject,I bought this book last Xmas at Foyles and brought it back to the states when I finally got the chance to read it. I frankly was very disappointed with it. The illustrations were fairly good but the text was not up to the usual standards of Oxford. Go to Norwich and you will be much better off !
4,The Oxford History of Byzantium,An excellent introduction to the subject for non-specialists. Lucidly written covering all the main topics. Good bibliography for further in depth reading
2,One of Oxford's Less Successful Enterprises,"The Oxford History Series is usually well done, with two exceptions, this book and the volume on the Crusades. Both are woefully short for their subject matter and just does not cover the subject in the depth that one is used to in other volumes of the series. I am highly disappointed in Oxford for this one."
5,An Accessible and Refreshing Text,"This book is not for the scholar, but can and ought to be read by any person with even the slightest interest in the mediaeval histories of Europe, the Church and the evolution of the relationship between church and state. Certainly the refreshing yet accessible perspectives presented in this volume do much to make Byzantium (with its one thousand years of unchecked caricature, associations and stereotypes) seem more like a real place with real people."
1,terrible,"This is not a manual, this is just a sampler. There are tapes, but no scientific phonetic notation. Very few words, forms and sentences."
3,Very dated now; please don't use this as an example of how to treat kids,"The story of a depressed child and his equally troubled parents and how they all improved, the child with play therapy and the parents with group and individual talk therapy. This case study is from the fifties and it's quite dated, very Freudian, a LOT of talk about penises and mothers. It's sort of interesting to see how much psychotherapy has changed since then."
3,Krusell Handit Case for Siemens SX66,"Very nice case, but it does not fit the Siemens SX66. I was very dissapointed.I resulted to putting velcro on the back of my Siemens SX66 to make it fit in the case."
3,This is a good CD for Parties,This CD is well worth adding to your collection especially if you are a DJ. The Polka's are great and the rest of the songs apply to most parties at one time or another.
3,"Hardly ""definitive""","There are certainly some great tracks on this CD, including some of the gospel songs for which the Bluegrass Cardinals are known (e.g. ""Shine Hallelujah Shine"") as well as secular songs (""I Wonder Where You Are Tonight"", ""The Old Man in the Park""). Unfortunately, this compilation entirely ignores the band's first two albums, ""Bluegrass Cardinals"" and ""Welcome to Virginia"", omitting several of their best-known songs, such as ""Ridin' on the L & N"", ""Blue Eyed Boston Boy"", ""Plant Some Flowers"", and ""Roll On, Muddy River"". These omissions are all the more painful because their second album, ""Welcome to Virginia"" has never been released digitally (CD or MP3), and Rounder has no plans to do so; the only way to hear many of the Bluegrass Cardinals' best songs is still on LP!"
2,jumbled lifetime movie,"The was a very uneven story. I couldn't tell whose story it was and I found the dialog unnatural and at times comical.I was disappointed that Ms.Miller did not portray the relationship between Daisy and Duncan for what is was-A predator and a victim. I was equally disappointed that when Daisy's father finally is aware of the relationship, he does not share the information that Duncan is a pedophile, thus allowing Duncan to get away with his behavior.All in all, the book misfired on several levels."
3,"Couldn't connect to the characters; feel ""managed"" by the author","I am a trifle shocked that I didn't really care for this book, since I have positively loved all Miller's other novels. With her other books I was deeply involved with the characters from the get-go, here the pages just went dreamily by with no personal feeling of involvment, or sense of caring for any of the many flat personalities populating its pages. I began to feel that the author was simply trying to manipulate her readers by means of her impressive writing prowess. Perhaps this feeling was heightened by the books slenderness. In the accompanying Reader's Guide the author reveals that the novel started its life as a unpublished short story; she also mentions Henry James' short novel, ""What Maisie Knew"" as an inspiration. But, alas, James' work is incomparably more powerful than Miller's has turned out. I hope this is a rare letdown in Miller's oeuvre, she is certainly a major American writer!"
4,Life from wine country,This story starts out slow but creates good character development. I like the description of the Napa Valley vineyards and how much the character knows about the land. The different points of view was used well in the book because we could see how a family tragedy brings family closer and at the same time tears them further apart. Details dysfunction and family dynamics well....
3,Celebrating Pedophilia,"If you want a novel that rationalizes child moloestation, here you go! Teenage daisy is molested by a 50 something family friend in extremely graphic detail, and the only ramifications are that her father suggests ""Duncan may not be the right person for you"" and resolves to pay her more attention. The end of the book has daisy entering therapy to ""understand"" the relationship, but also feeling grateful to Duncan for helping her to understand the sexual behavior of adults. Yuck! Sue Miller is a wonderful writer, but shame on her for for framing child abuse as a disfunctional relationship."
3,Disturbing,"SPOILER ALERT!!This book was well written, as all Sue Miller's books are. It had interesting (but not terrbly appealing) characters, and great, realistic dialogue, but it contained highly disturbing and erotically written sex scenes between a lonely, hard edged teenaged girl and a completely narcissistic, sleazy older man that left me quite queasy. To me this was sexual abuse, but it was never defined that way. All in all the book left me with an empty feeling, despite the girl's father more or less stepping up to the protective plate."
2,Bored in the Forest,"I just finished this book and was surprised when I logged on that so many people really liked this book. There were so many times during reading this book that I just wanted to abandon it, but I am of the philosophy that there is at least some satisfaction from finishing the book and then looking at it as a whole. Upon doing that, I was very disappointed. I felt it left so many issues unresolved- but even worse I didn't really care if they got resolved or not. Yes, there was the attempt to summarize everything in the final chapter- but it still didn't satisfy. This sounded like such a great book to me but I just felt like everything was so rushed and I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters."
2,My final Miller book,"I keep giving Sue Miller another chance, but this book did it for me. I will not pick up another book of hers. Why I finished this book is beyond me. The characters were shallow and not fully fleshed out, the story was beyond depressing, and the scenes with Daisy and her lover were way too graphic. In fact, I found that part disgusting....and I am no prude, believe me.A better, deeper, and more realistic book about the same subject is ""Good Grief"" by Lolly Winston.I think Miller is a good writer, but she seems to gravitate toward writing stories that do not showcase her talent."
1,Perpetuation of child molestation,"As a "" molest survivor"" I found this book offensive in it's disregard of Duncan's molestation of Daisy. I could not understand Mark's not telling Eva; reporting Duncan to the police nor could I understand why He,in a sense, protected Duncan by keeping ""the secret"". I am disappointed in Miller's handling of this subject and that she seems to downplay the evisceration of the soul this type of abuse can have on a young person."
2,"Fifteen year olds do not have ""affairs"" it's called sexual abuse","I usually enjoy Sue Miller's novels, but this one had an appalling theme. I'm amazed that only one reviewer found the abuse of Daisy to be just that, not ""seduction"" or an ""affair"" but a crime, and one in which the criminal isn't punished or even embarrassed. The descriptions of the ""collateral damage"" of divorce were well done,but, as many reviewers have pointed out, the ending failed. The adults in Daisy's life failed her, especially the father who suspects that she has been abused but never confronts the abuser. I had hoped that the ending would find Duncan in prison!"
4,"dark, disturbing and decadent!!!","Sue Miller is, I believe, one of the finest writers in the fiction world today. Her insight into the human psyche is unparalleled. ""Lost In The Forest"" is a fine example of her craftmanship. The character development is stunning, drawing the reader into the midst of this whole sad familyThe seduction of Daisy is dealt with in a rather offhand manner, leading the reader to believe that the author finds this horrific relationship ,although lifechanging,somehow helpful to this child. The fact that the father knew and did nothing is incomprehensible. To allow the perpetrator to escape without punishment or even chastisement is shocking. Where are the moral valus of the author? I really think I will pass on any more of her novels! ."
4,Interesting topic,"A book that gets you thinking about the different types of marriages people have, relationships within families, and how over time people grow up and discover new things about themselves. Certain things in the book are hard to read but they do come across as truthful."
3,"Ms. Miller has both better books, but it's okay","I've read everything Sue Miller has written and been thoroughly captivated by her ability to dig deep into families and pull out characters that are timeless and sincere. The scenes between the older male character and the teen girl are riveting and painful. However, the plot line for the female lead character circles around, goes nowhere, and doesn't leave the reader any wiser for the trip. Try her novel, On Love, for a truly powerful read."
1,Jailtime for the Predator?,"Couldn't agree more with readers disturbed by Miller's treatment of the predatorial ""relationship"" between the middle aged man and the teenage daughter."
2,Not what was expected,"I have loved most of Sue Miller's past books. They provide entertainment and quality character development. While the setting in this book was interesting, the plot was lacking. I thought I would be reading about a coming of age girl, yet this tended to be about sexual abuse. I found it disturbing especially because there was not enough information provided to find any sympathy for the characters. This book did not live up to my expectations."
3,"Decently written, Predictable plot","This is my first Sue Miller so I'm not sure how it compares to her others...but its a decent novel to keep you occupied for a few days. The basics of the story has been described in other reviews so I won't repeat it, but I will say that about two-thirds the way into the novel, rather than getting more interesting the conflicts between characters seemed old, like they were being replayed.One of my favorite scenes from this book is the family around the table when Theo, the youngest (about 3-4) requests a story...and each of the others tell a part. This scene reappeared a few times, captured what I think is some of the essence that Miller tries to convey."
5,Awesome Book for all levels of expierience,This book is a good starting point if you want to learn ASP.NET. It is very descriptive and has lots of things you can try on your computer. This also has some code for advanced web apps such as a chat-room. I would also recomend that you buy a book on Visual Basic.net because you need to know that language if you are going to use asp.net. VB.net is an easy to learn language. You can also use it to write windows applications. This book is one of the best books i have seen. For more codes i would also reccomend bying the asp.net programming bible which is packed with stuff.
5,Solid start to asp.net,"Hi allGreat book to get you/me started in asp.net. I didn't have a clue about the whole MS.net technology but Bill explains it all simply and in an amusing way. His web site now works (hope she has had the baby by now Bill!!) and is great for extra infoAlways loved the for Dummies series along with Wrox they are by far the best programming studies out there and yes, that includes O'ReillyChaoJon"
2,Not what expected,This book its deficient and it doesnt explain you how to use the Visual Studio Interface.
2,Only scratches the surface!,"There is so much depth to asp.net that a ""For Dummies"" book can't possibly begin to do the subject justice.In making the jump from classic ASP to ASP.NET I purchased this book first and found that it did not even come close to teaching me what I needed to know about dynamic page generation and database driven content.This book would be a good place to start if you are completely new to web site development and would like to just get your feet wet, but if your versed in classic ASP and are looking to migrate, then I would suggest ASP.Net Unleased instead.[...]"
1,"Confusing, poor examples",This book was a major disappointment for me. I have found the Microsoft Press Series like Microsoft Asp.net Programming with Microsoft Visual Basic.net Step by Step to be both easier to understand and more comprehensive.I just found the book to be utterly confusing. The examples are childish and have no real world bearing.
5,Excellent book for those new to .NET and programming,"ASP.NET for Dummies is an excellent book for the beginning .NET developer and programmer. I am a web designer that decided to learn to code for the web using something other than Javascript and HTML. The book was great to learn programming basics as well as getting me up and running in .NET. I have started down a path of learning a great code language, VB, and I owe it to this book. Highly recommended."
3,Kids played with this for over a year,"Its not the most durable thing, but my kids managed to play with this almost daily for about a year. I would never have guessed that. We just used it indoors, high ceilings."
1,Flimsy,I am disappointed because this is a really flimsy toy. The launch button doesn't push most of the time (so Superman doesn't launch) and the foam Superman tears easily.
5,Glad I ignored the bad reviews.,"I just finished the entire series. This series is an epic tale and each book actually get better than the last. You can definitely ascertain the political viewpoint from the author in the series. This was no problem for me because I agree with him 100% :). If you don't, you won't like the series; I can pretty much guarantee it. In any case, this series was so good it made tears come to my eyes at times. I read a lot and there's not much that can surprise me, but this one got me."
1,so dumb...,"I will read just about anything. I travel a lot, and downloaded this before a 5 hour flight. Less than an hour into the flight I was through about 85 pages, and just couldn't deal with how dumb this book was. From the basic issues like typos, to conceptual dead-ends, to well, just about the whole thing, I found the book to be devoid of nutritional content."
2,A glossy book,"Trying to finish the book, but it has no substance. There is no real depth to the characters, and no real thought given to the science of the time, just running around shooting anything that moves. I imagine anyone who liked starship troopers might like this. At least starship troopers was a satire. I'm only going through the motions of reading it because I spent $18.00."
1,Disappointing Heinlein Knock Off,"Trite, poorly written story and stock characters derivative of Robert Heinlein's ""Starship Trooper"" written for subteen males who dream of dystopian future where immortal demigods roam the universe blowing things up as members of a legion whose motto is ""shoot first and ask questions later"".The author and his fans forgot, or maybe never knew, that Heinlein's story was a children's book and that when Shakespeare had a character say ""first let's kill all the lawyers"" he didn't mean it. Thank God we don't live on a Legion World."
4,Good but overpriced,"Lots of good action. A little jumpy in places (like I had to see if I skipped a page or a chapter was missing). That's part of the reason for four stars. The other is the price. It's grossly overpriced. It's not worth $15-20. Wait for the price to drop, or buy it elsewhere."
1,I Thought For .99 Cents...,"I thought that for .99 cents what was I really risking? It turns out this truly was a case of you get what you pay for: zero character development, ridiculous character names, poor plot development, silly, stilted, and horribly contrived dialogue with no credibility, and finally, battle scenes that seem straight out of a 50s Hollywood matinee in which the ""good guys"" always win, and the ""bad guys"" always die.To be fair, there were instances of imagery that I thought were actually pretty good, but they were few and far between. I only finished reading this book to see if it got better as it went, but it never improved.Really, save your buck and skip this."
4,great read,this is a great book im not a fan of sci fi but i thought i would take a look. its one of the those books where it hard to put down.great read i recommend to fantasy/call of duty fans. lots of guns. totally worth the cash
3,sci-fi combatesque,"This book felt like a cliff-notes version of a sci-fi combat book. I felt like so much was being skimmed over or left out in both action and character interplay/development. The jargon ""of the time and place"" left me a bit cold as well. I don't enjoy reading for entertainment where I need to consult the glossary to know what the characters are talking about, their equipment, or what they're doing. I would not recommend this book to friends. If you want a great sci-fi first-person combat book, read Armor by John Steakley."
2,"Not good, even for mindless reading","I am a sci-fi freak, and will read just about anything, but Soldier of the Legion just is not worth the time. It's Starship Troopers without characterization or plot."
5,Soldier of the Legion CD,Very creative story for adults because of the mayhem. Professionly done and the sound effects were outstanding. Hope there is a another book in the making.
2,Misses the mark :(,The writing just seemed too cliched. It was how a guy who knows nothing about soldiers imagines how they act based on bad movies. Move on. Not even worth the dollar.
2,Fish Do The Strangest Things,"For a book that is that old, it was in pretty good condition. It could have been better, but I can still read this to my 4 yr old grandson..."
3,Love the Blade!,"I absolutely love the blade on this machete! It sharpened to a great edge with a bastard cut file, and it is as sharp as any knife.However, the handle is the downfall of this product... I use the machete to cut brush, and after about a month of Saturday use, the handle is becoming loose. Since it is held by rivets, there is virtually no way to tighten it. I am waiting for it to go completely, and then hopefully replace the rivets with a solid bolt, providing I can find an adequate bolt that will not protrude and cause my hand damage.Would I buy this again? Definitely! The price is great, and well worth the value of the blade. I only wish they had spent a few more dollars on an equally fantastic handle..."
4,Solid Overview of the CSA-USA Naval Efforts,"In Divided Waters, Ivan Musicant provides a solid, although at times basic, overview of Confederate and Union naval efforts, strategies, conflicts and technological developments during the Civil War. Organized by theater of operations instead of chronologically, there are some moments where the events of one chapter seem odd in the context of the previous chapter, but this is a minor flaw. Probably the most interesting chapter is the all-too-short discussion of CSA-USA conflicts on the high seas and around the world; it is interesting to read about the delicate dance naval officers played in ports as far away as Brazil and France. Musicant is obviously a fan of ironclads, and a great deal of the book is devoted to their use in various campaigns. He gives equal time to their successes and shortfalls."
2,Divided Waters,"This introduction to the naval history of the Civil War suffers from the author's bias, which interferes with his ability to provide readers with a scholarly, objective analysis. Musicant sometimes seems to spend more time making snide remarks and calling people names than he does analyzing his sources.However, if one can get past the bias, this is a reasonably complete introduction to the Civil War at sea, and the text is well furnished with quotes, which adds excitement. Ironclads get most of the attention here, with the commerce raiders and, strangely, the Hunley, rather scanted."
5,Just the Facts a pocket guide to basic nursing,The best book I ever used as a nursing student. It was in my pocket every time I went to clinicals.
2,where's music?,"Well, I must be spoiled by the sounds of Tchaikovsky, Delibes, Adam, Prokofiev etc. But where is music in this ballet? There are sounds, mostly random, there are trite themes, but otherwise I prefer to watch it muted. Visually the ballet is colorful indeed. Humor? Perhaps. But mostly low level sort of. Dances? Crowdy. Chaotic. But not deterministically chaotic as Carroll intended. Music could have saved it all, but again, where is it?"
4,cover photo trivia,"Wow, surprised to see this CD is still available `new`. I was just going through some boxes in storage and came across it, almost forget that I owned this disc. Good live document from the band at their best (it was all downhill from here, especially after teaming up with pretentious-music-school-avante-wunderboy O'Rourke)..An odd thing about the album cover that I never really thought about until just now: the photo features the first SY drummer Bob Bert. Not only was he playing with the Chrome Cranks by the time this CD came out (late nineties), but he was already out of the band when they played the show in 87. So, I'm not sure why he's on the album cover, if anyone has an anecdote to share please post it here ;)"
5,I cant believe I missed this show!,"I was supposed to be at this show. Well maybe not ""supposed"", but I had planned on going I just couldnt find a ride (I was 14, no drivers license). When I saw the date and location of this live CD, I of course freaked out. After hearing this disc, I totally wish I was there. This is a great live document of Sister era SY (their best IMO). Dont listen to the people that say the sound quality is lacking, it really isnt. In fact I think the sound quality is pretty great. It makes me wonder what kind of records these people are listening to. I fully agree with the review below me, if there is one thing I cant stand, its audiophiles, especially ones complaining about a SY live recording. If you are a SY fan, you need to own this."
2,Very bad sound,"I feel there is much good energy in the performances. But for 1987, there is no excuse to have produced such a poorly recorded album. It does not do any good credit to the talent involved. Or I might have acquired a badly manufactured product. Miroslav Grubelic, Caracas, Venezuela"
3,a very average sonic album,the band on the cover of this album is pussy galore- from an issue of spin magazine a long time ago when spin was cool- not sonic youth. the music is for hardcore fans. the same people who listened to sonic death all the way through. it is a painfully average sonic youth album that is nowhere near as interesting as the band
1,tom and jerry,I know it had been use but did not know it would be missing page. will not buy use product again
3,missing supplies,Fits great but requires 8 very small screws that do not come with the kit. And 4 larger screws that are not included either
5,PERFECT,Perfect Fit. I have had 3 other DIN's but this one in particular seems to fit perfectly in my '06 Corolla.
4,Fit perfectly,Exactly what I was looking for.Arrived on time and simple to install.Fit really well on my toyota corolla 2006 LE.
3,Does not fit as advertised,"I had to cut off the edges of this bracket for it to even fit. Even after fitting it laterally, it projects too much from the console."
1,Does not fit the Brazilian made Corolla 2006,This damn thing does not fit the Brazilian made Corolla. It's too big so you'll have to cut it on the left and right side to make it fit.
3,It is okay,It is not strong and needs a little Technic to installhowever with the price I paid it is okay.
3,"Good, but...","This product worked exactly as functioned. However, right beneath where you would install the single DIN head unit is a sort of compartment that's a bit too small for you to reach back into, yet there is no way to stop items from falling back in there. That's a big pain and I feel it would have taken just a little bit of thinking to remove this design issue."
1,missing grove,"the front panel is missing the necessary grove hence I am unable to fit the front face of my sony system.after installing every thing when we tried to install the front face encountered this issue. the support team saidI need to resent this to them for the replacement, but to do that I have to go to shop to do that they will again charge me.it is waste of time."
5,Fits and Looks Sick,After ordering this online and getting it in 2 Fast Days!!!! i got it installed and it looks great and fit perfectly in my 2004 Toyota corolla! now I'm enjoying my new stereo :D!!!
4,Fits Perfectly and Looks Good,"I am very pleased with this DIN adapter. I installed mine in a 2006 Corolla and had no problems at all. The instructions were adequate, but if you are mechanically inclined you may not even need them. The one thing I wish this kit included is a set of mounting screws for attaching the radio to it. I had to go buy them after the fact. At least 4 of them are needed."
2,AUS WARNING,"WARNING, This unit does not fit in Australian model Toyota's. It is too big. I had to grind and file mine down and just got it to fit, but what should have taken 20 mins took over 3 hours. Also the space under the unit is a good idea, however it has two holes in the bottom of it at the back, so if you but something small in there it will fall through"
3,Posey padded arm sleeve,"I have worn this sleeve once since it arrived.My arms are not big in circumference, yet themedium size I bought feels tight.The materialused has low elasticity.The inside surface ofthe sleeve is like terry cloth. The length doesnot go past my elbow to the upper arm.The thumbloop is a good feature. Constructionseems good, as far as durability goes.The package contains a pair of sleeves.Shipping was slow.It took 10 days to arrive.At$8 for shipping, that's not good."
2,Not a happy customer this time,The L Screen poles were slightly bent. Made it very difficult to set up. The bending of the poles makes it impossible to be portable now which is why I bought it.
1,A good wing will blow it over.,A good wind will blow this unit over. It did to mine and the metal bent so that it would not collapse. I only had it for 5 months and Sport Co the retailer & Easton the manufacturer both refused to back up the product. You are way better off with the Jugs collapsable L screen. Much sturdier unit that will last much longer.
4,"well organized, good explanations, BUT not for under 1500","Well organized, good explanations, BUT not for under 1500.I am b/w 1300 and 1400, so maybe I failed to see somethings, but this book seemed to be ""tutorial"". However,explanations are good. Very well organized!But, somehow I thought it was comprehensive."
5,A magnificent book,"This book is more complete than I thought! In my modest opinion it's magnificent. It has a great practical value and will be very helpful in my work as therapist. And it's exactly the kind of help I was looking for! This publication will be a guidance not only for me but for all of my coworkers here in my province, since I'll make sure that this useful work and his author be of everyone's knowledge.I am a cuban psychologist working in a clinic for foreign drug dependence patients. This work has enriched our experience and it has been of great help. It combines successfully both Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy and addiction. I recommend it to every therapist working in this field, including those from Latin American countries. Some of my colleagues who have already read it as well as me, have commented about the values of this book, that is, for all of us, a masterpiece!"
5,"From Terry London, Dir. of Chicago Institute for R.E.B.T.","In my professional opinion, Mr. Bishop's book, Managing Addictions, is one of the two or three best books written for working professionals or interested lay people in the area of the treatment of addictive behaviors. My graduate students and clinical interns have found this text to be extremely useful and helpful in developing their skills when working with their clients with addictive problems. Also, some of my clients have read the book and have been able to apply many of the cognitive, emotive, and behavioral techniques for their own benefit and positive change. Great book and a great contribution!!! Hope many more people will end up reading and using Mr. Bishop's valuable information!!!"
4,Very Helpful,"This book is a great tool for techniques, strategies and information for the SLP, parents and teachers. It is a great resource to utilize with all populations of individuals with fluency disorders."
5,As a Resource...,"Obviously, no one will read this book cover to cover (it wasn't meant for that), but as a resource, a place to get ideas to keep therapy fresh, this is a nice book to have on the shelf."
3,Alaska's Own,"Rory Merritt Stitt grew up in Juneau, Alaska, part of a musical family, and picked up the piano early on (he was classically trained). His arrangements are quirky, poppy and sometimes unorthodox (compared to say, John Cale, Rory's music is lighter, warmer, and a little more playful, but no less eccentric). This CD should appeal to fans of Tori Amos, PJ Harvey, Annie Lennox, XTC, and Rachmaninoff."
1,A total waste,"My cat's been on this spot for a full month now & I've just pulled 4 live fleas off of her. I followed what little info was included, no way it's user error from such little info. I'll be calling for a refund in the am."
1,POISON POISON POISON PLEASE READ,We used this product on our pet and she had TERRIBLE reactions. Look up reactions with this product from google. Many people's pets DIE from this. The pets will convulse and cry for days. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
1,Never... ever...,"I bought this for my kitty. She promptly vomited, has been withdrawn, drinking tons of H20 to clean her system and to top it off, the product did zilch to stop fleas. Never, ever buy this garbage. Save yourself some heartache and pay an extra ten bucks."
1,useless,"i am giving this one star because you can't go any lower. This product does not work. I bought it, because it's so much cheaper than advantage and frontline. Treated both my cats, both still have fleas (i have not had fleas in my house since the first time i used advantage, probably a decade ago, used it once, never saw a flea again,till now. now i think they are coming over from my neighbor)after the treatment, so went back to advantage (which i haven't had to use as mentioned earlier). They were just treated with advantage, so i can rest easy now knowing the fleas are history. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra to get a product that actually kills the fleas."
1,poison.,This specifically just killed a very dear friend of mines cat. This product should not be on the shelves at all as it's obviously killing animals.
1,Sergeant's Gold Should Be Illegal,"I bought Sergeants Gold because it was cheaper and it was sold at a reputable store therefore I assumed it would be fine. If I had bought this online and saw all of the reviews I never would have purchased it. I put it on my cat as directed, and she began scratching all of her hair off in the area where it was applied. A vet bill later and at least my cat didn't die as noted in some of the other reviews.My vet noted that she has seen a lot of issues with this product, and that she has also seen it end in death for other animals. I don't understand how this company is in business or how. I really regret not having researched this product more before I used it."
1,Didn't work at all!,"I got this for my kitten after I spotted some fleas on him. It is supposed to work IMMEDIATELY, 3 days later I am using a flea comb because the fleas are still alive and well and I don't want to risk any more toxic treatments until the 3 week period is up. Awful, waste of money."
1,Bad stuff,"This is a known poison used in nerve gas. It will make your animal terribly sick, and can even kill it. If you call the company and complain hard enough they will pay for the vet bills, but they should really ban this product."
2,Didn't kill my cats,"I purchased this and used it on all 3 of my cats. Then I checked these on-line reviews to see people's opinions on how well it worked - almost had a heart attack. Well, all 3 of my cats are fine and none have had any adverse reactions after 3 weeks. It seems to have worked somewhat, but not as well as the Revolution we usually use. Think logically - if this is sold in tens of thousands of stores across the country for many years, and really made anywhere near a large percentage of cats sick or die, it would not be on the market. Apparently some cats have real problems with this product, just like some people have real problems with peanuts or bee stings - but peanuts are on the market and bees are thought of as ""good"" insects. Anyway, I think I'll be going back to Revolution instead of this product, mainly because I feel that Revolution works somewhat better."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I used this product 3 times. Each time my cat suffered from chemical burns, with welts forming, and fur eventually falling off. I will never use it again. I'm now researching alternatives such as Frontline and Advantage II, but I will NEVER use Sergeant's Gold again. I'm surprised that such a product could be legally sold in the US."
2,this customer not happy,"This customer was not happy due to products arriving with bright yellow and orange stickers on them that said ""$1"" and ""Last chance"" on the products, as if the flea products had been bought at a ""swop meet"" or ""flea market."" I let the vendor know about this, and then did NOT use the products/could not trust they would do what I bought them to do/ or would be safe on our cats."
1,Dangerous !!! Sticking with Frontline Products,Burned my cat's skin. Fur in the area all fell off with 24 hours. Left welts that scabbed over. Terrible!!!!
1,Don't ever buy this rubbish for your cat unless you want to kill it.,"Applied this to my cat as directed, and within 24 hours he started having seizures, foaming from the mouth, and was hardly able to walk. After a call to the vet, DAWN dish soap bath and a little prayer he came out of it. Never EVER buy this product. It didn't contain a warning that this type of reaction would happen - if It did I would have NEVER bought it."
1,Stay away from this! Consult a vet instead.,"Very toxic stuff. I used it on my cat as a preventive measure, following all the instructions. Later that night, he became ill and scratched off all the fur in the area where it was applied. I washed him off and took him to the vet, who gave him a shot of cortizone and some antibiotics. He got better after about a week of treatment, and is fully recovered now."
1,DANGEROUS!,"I applied to my healthy cat and immediately, he showed a bad reaction to this med. I tried to wipe some of it off, but it was to late. He developed LARGE scabs at the area. It seems like it burned his skin!! It was horrible! He spends all day trying to lick his wounds! Will be needing to take him to the vet!"
5,Great resource,"I haven't yet taken the MAT, but I am hopeful that this book will be the preparation I need to get a good score. I really like the layout and all of the practice tests with the explanations."
4,More than just a legendary prog-rock guitarist,"Knowing and liking Howe's work from the prog-rock group Yes, I decided to give his solo work a listen. What a pleasant surprise! He is so much more than just a rock guitarist. He is a guitar virtuoso.He plays many different styles and stringed instruments on this disc. A total of 24 as a matter of fact.He ranges from New Age to Jazz to Flamenco. It is a very melodic and soothing album. If your looking for the long guitar solos of Yes, you're not going to find them here. What you will find is 60 minutes of wonderful, outstanding guitar playing from one of the music world's most talented guitar players."
2,Elevator Music - This definitely is not rock and roll,"I'm a huge Yes and Steve Howe fan and I just don't get this one. Blah. This could easily be on-hold music for when you call some business. I can't believe this is Steve Howe. The only pleasant surprise is the opening song, ""Small Acts of Human Kindness"" ...which is the only song with singing - other than its reprise at the end of the CD. It is rather relaxing as another person cited. So if that's what you're after, try it; but don't say I didn't warn you. ;0)"
4,YES! This is New-Age Steve Howe,"I have always been a big fan of ""YES"" and Steve Howe so it was only logical to check out some of Steve's solo efforts. To be perfectly honest, I only listened to the thirty second sample tracks of some of his more popular albums. I found the five sample tracks of ""Skyline"" to be the most appealing to me so I decided to take a chance and buy it. What a wise decision I made. Although I have heard slightly better from Steve, this CD will sooth and captivate all but the most picky of critics.Great music to relax and chill-out to..........."
2,Good movie but...,"Miracle on 34th Street is a wonderful movie but on the DVD that I bought the sound isn't in sync with the actors lips but is a little bit ahead of them. However, It's a Wonderful Life gets five stars; there are no problems with that DVD."
3,Need a Magnifier to Read,"Unfortunately the print is so fine that it strains my eyes. It was not available for my Kindle so I bought the paperback edition. Although not a lot of money, still a waste. Sorry Mark wont be able to rate the content."
4,More about Fuhrman than OJ,"There's lots of valuable information here for OJ case buffs, including some things that didn't come out at the trial but should have (such as the empty knife box). However, the book (as well as Fuhrman's other true-crime books) isn't structured well; if you've been spoiled by the quasi-novelistic narratives of Ann Rule, Fuhrman's clunkier writing may disappoint you.Fuhrman also devotes too much prose to self-serving justifications of his use of the ""N-word"" and flirtations with Naziism. At times the book seems to be more about Fuhrman and his sullied reputation than about OJ. I can understand him wanting to rehabilitate his image, but that should have been saved for an autobiography."
5,Fuhrman strikes back,"In a single moment of poor judgment a innocent cop unwittingly provides ammunition for a a race-obsessed defense team to destroy his reputation and allow a double-murderer to walk free. In ""Murder in Brentwood,"" Detective Mark Fuhrman documents his downward spiral from star prosecution witness to his unjustified public vilification as racist white cop. Candidly told with impeccable attention to detail, this account is unlike others in the deluge of books on the Simpson case, emphasizing the cold facts. Fuhrman calmly and methodically reveals the blunders of the star-struck prosecution and incompetent police criminology, while exposing the twisted justice of a morally bankrupt defense team who who ruined the life of a good cop so a guilty man could walk free. Mark Fuhrman may have been stripped of his badge, but never his dignity"
4,"Just the facts, Ma'am","Fuhrman's book is a good, straightforward telling of the Simpson investigation. For the most part, he seems impartial, drawing his conclusions from the evidence alone. My only criticism is that I felt he defended himself too often, but that's to be expected, I guess, when people are blaming you (wrongly) for setting a murderer free. Some chapters seem to be all about Fuhrman, but most of the book is about the case and evidence themselves. I learned a lot from this book that I wasn't aware of during the trial, and I agree with Fuhrman that if the prosecution had done its job, Simpson would be behind bars today. This was a much better read for me that Vincent Bugliosi's book,Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away With Murder, which was too emotional and seemed more like a rant than an objective look at the case."
5,Mr. Fuhrman needs no redemption,"This book sat on my shelf for months before I finally read it, and now I'm actually glad for the time and distance from the trial. I've never been sure what to believe about Mr. Fuhrman. After reading his book, and some of the others about the trial and its aftermath, I believe he needed no redemption, and had he been financially able to mount a defense, would have been handily acquitted of perjury charges. I wish the Fuhrmans peace in Idaho, and I'm anxious to read ""Murder in Greenwich."""
4,Cops-eye view of a murder investigation and what went wrong,"While Fuhrman won't win any awards for good writing, his subject matter held my attention as he walked through the crime scene step-by-step. He presented a strong case for being tagged scapegoat of the decade.Fuhrman leads the reader through his investigation techniques and discoveries. Evidence never brought to light in the trial, now clearly points a bloody finger at those guilty for this failure in our justice system. His voice shouts a message clear and strong that no one is perfect and we all carry a dark side"
5,First impressions of a person can be changed,"This is an important book for everyone to read to discovery the truth of what we all read and watch during the trial of O.J. Simpson. Mark Furhman left the trial as a ""bad cop""- not so- read this book and the truth hits us all in ""the eye"""
2,Not worth the efford,"While I agree that O.J. was guilty and that Mark Fuhrman was treated unfairly at the trial, this is still a bad book--repetitive, superficial, egotistical, fraught with typos. Fuhrman needed a really good editor if he wanted his story told well. This is about a third of a book, padded just to fill the space"
5,We all know OJ left a map of his DNA all over,"Mark Furhman did a great job explaing this case. He is a great detective, he want on to help solve an old cold case after this case. He's not afraid to investigate someone with political pull, or celebrity status. They sure could use him on the Ramsey case."
5,The Other Side Of The Simpson Trial,"It was amazing that in the wake of two dead bodies and a mountain of evidence pointing to a certain former football star, actor, celebrity that the trial became about Mark Fuhrman rather than justice. This is written to show his side and what he endured during this circus sideshow of a trial. Well told and well written."
4,MURDER IN BRENTWOOD,Mark Fuhrman has a wealth of information regarding the O.J. Simpson case. He presents the facts in a clear and concise manner. The reader gains an insight of the politics of law enforcement - the self-serving actions of some so called public servants. His writing educates the reader on the exacting manner of how an investigation should be conducted.He was placed in a frustrating situation - his colleagues failed him - the presecution team failed him - and the justice system failed him. He became the sacrificial lamb of that entire farce of a trial. He can hold his head high and be proud of the way he conducted himself--he was treated most unfairly. The system lost an intelligent and conscientious detective.
5,This book changed my mind!,"After the OJ trial, I was convinced by the evidence presented (or lack thereof) that O.J. Simpson was innocent and justice had prevailed. I read Mark Furman's book the week it came out. My eyes were opened, wide!! Of course, OJ is guilty. The sad part is that everyone involved in the trial was too busy trying to grab their 15 minutes of fame to prove his guilt. The prosecution failed to present very damaging evidence. Judge Ito made mistake afer mistake. And the defense team was in it for the fame and glory. O.J. won, but America lost this one."
3,Less about Brentwood and more about Fuhrman,"I actually found this book to be less about what I expected: the murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson. Fuhrman seemed to focus on how it all affected him - which is of course his right - however I think he should have been more honest about his motives, simply through choosing a more appropriate title. There are no revelations, bar some examples of evidence not admissable in the trial. This book is very self-serving."
4,GULITY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT,"THIS BOOK LET'S YOU IN ON THE SECRETS OF THE CASE AND GIVES GOOD DETAILS BUT IT SEEMS MARK FURMAN IS TRYING TO CLEAR HIMSELF OF THE RACIST WORD THE WHOLE WORLD HEARD HIM SAY. IF ANY ONE WHO READS THIS BOOK STILL BELIVES O.J IS GUILTY SOMETHING IS WRONG. I DON'T BELIVE ANY ONE IS THAT DUMB TO LEAVE THAT MUCH EVIDENCE AROUND THE HOUSE IN THE TRUCK AND ON THE VICTIMS. UP UNTIL I READ THIS BOOK I BELIVED THAT O.J COULD HAVE DONE IT AND THAT SOMEONE IN THE POLICE OFFICE TRIED TO MAKE SURE HE WAS CONVICTED BUT AFTER READING IT I REALY THINK SOMEONE SET HIM UP, MAYBE O.J HIMSELF!"
2,The book is solid but the Kindle edition is littered with misspellings.,I'm shocked how many punctuation and misspelling errors there are in the Kindle edition. I hope they fix it soon.
3,Another self-serving author in need of editor,"Maybe if I wrote a book that involved me I'd also make myself out to be a hero but I hope not. Fuhrman overstates his importance in the OJ trial and understates his negatives as a human being. The real story was the murders and the farce of a trial that followed, not Fuhrman self-proclaimed heroics as a cop.OJ would have gotten off with or without Fuhrman because the blacks on the jury were not going to convict one of their own, and the whites on the jury just wanted to go home. It's called jury nullification and it is epidemic in most big cities with large minority populations. The civil trial was won in jury selection - only 1 of the 12 was black.As I write this, OJ is in prison, and Cochrane and Kardashian both died painfully from disease. Karma is a bitch."
4,i can see why mark furhman is furious and frustrated,"this poor man was made the scapegoat for the murders just by virtue of being called to a murder scene and doing his job. he presents the facts in a very detailed and concise manner, but his anger and frustration (completely and totally justified) is peppered throughout. when the true criminal goes to trial for his most recent crimes in las vegas, i hope he is found guilty and goes to jail. i hope johnny cochran is not only turning over in his grave, i hope he's rotating!"
4,In-Depth Details on Nicole Brown Simpson / Ron Goldman Murder Scenes,"It was good to see the actual evidence trail. There is so much evidence that the public never knew about that is revealed in this book. It is so terribly disturbing to see how many mistakes the police made. Mark Fuhrman made mistakes. The other detectives on-scene made mistakes. However, you can tell from Fuhrman's notes, that he is a highly skilled detective. His notes were flawless and methodical. Things that come from years of experience. If you were a follower of the OJ Simpson trial, you will find this book very enlightening. You will find your eyes wide and your attention glued to the pages. The only reason I gave this a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating; It would have been an easier read if some of the repetition had been left out. I found myself skipping over parts of the book that had already been covered in other chapters."
5,"Insightful, honest, and surprising--Can't put this one down!","Mark Fuhrman gives us an honest look at the Brentwood murders. It is not a feel sorry for me because of what happened, kind of book. It is about the straight truth of what this man did and saw, to pinpoint the two victims killer. My utmost respect to Mr. Fuhrman for his no-nonsense approach to those few fateful days that saw two people murdered, and one man betrayed. Bravo!"
5,No BS book that is a must read,"I steadfastly avoided ALL media coverage regarding the OJ trial because I share the opinions of Mark Fuhrman and Daryl Gates about the media. For the most part they are biased and unreliable. At any rate, this book is an excellent no-nonsense account of what happened by one who knew the facts. Mark admits he made mistakes in his past (who hasn't?) and apologizes for them, but people being the way they are want blood and are not willing to forgive. Not that what he did doesn't matter - it just doesn't matter to the case. Also truly sad is the way the LAPD abandoned him and the pathetic way Marcia Clark buried him, not to mention the section about Margaret York's sworn statement. She should have been busted down from Captain for that.I for one will not read any book written by Clark, Darden, Cochrane, Bailey or Schapiro. They are about as reliable as the media.I too, want Mark to write other books about his experiences as an LAPD officer/detective. Go for it Mark!"
3,Interesting statement about our legal system's faults,"Like another reviewer said, 'a bit self serving' however an excellent expose on the failure of the system due to incompetence, celebrity worship, ineffective police work and corruption in the legal system (let's use the race card every time). Mr. Fuhrman's account of this event is revealing and disturbing."
4,Excellent Review of the OJ Simpson Case!,"I backed into this book. That is, I read Mr. Furhman's other book ""Murder in Greenwich"" first. AND LOVED IT. GREAT BOOK, CHECK IT OUT! This is the first OJ book I read. Like everyone else I was OJ'd out-big time. But Mr. Furhman does a fine job in his first book. Alot of the evidence he mentions was brought up at trial but there is alot of things he noticed/discovered that was never brought up. He really redeems himself, showing that he is an excellent detective, hung out to dry by OJ's manipulative defense team. I'll be reading all of his books in the future."
1,Could not finish reading this GARBAGE!,"Let me start out by saying before reading this book, I like many others thought Mr. Furhman was just another casualty in the O.J. trial. Now that I actually read only half of the book, before I threw it in the trash, I have to say that this was the worst book I have ever read. Mr. Furhman lives his life by blaming other it seems. I have read Marcia Clark's and Christopher Darden's version of this trial and the thing I noticed is that they both admitted their mistakes. I did not read one thing that Mr. Furhman wrote that said he did one thing wrong it was everyone else in the case. I have no doubt that O.J. Simpson is guilty of double homicide but it all boils down to a almost black jury who stuck it to the people who in their minds had stuck it to their people for so long. The prosecution did not have a chance from the start. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WHINNING, CRYBABY GARBAGE!"
4,Great Insider's view of the Case,"After all has been said and done, I am convinced of Mark Furman's integrity as a detective. I am also convinced that he can be completely trusted to tell the truth about the facts of this case. His defense of himself re: the tapes was a little un-convincing, but this does not diminish the book as very entertaining and a good education about the case."
5,The one book that puts the Simpson case together,"Of all the books on the O.J. trial, this one asksthe best questions, and gives the most plausible insight into why and how this case was so mishandled.If you have time for only one book about the Simpson case, make it this one."
4,Finally Mark Furhman lets us know what he thinks!,"The O.J. Simpson fiasco continues. Have we all heard enough about this legal disaster? No, those of us who followed the trial from its beginning cannot get enough details, and finally Mark Furhman speaks out to let us hear his side of the story. Here is the cop that discovered some of the most important evidence, a very competent cop who put his life on the line daily for the people of LA. It is an important book that lets the public see the other side (the real side) of Mark Furhman. He does not excuse his past behavior but rather clearly questions what any of that had to do with the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson. His career has been ended through no fault of his own - but rather by the ""Scheme Team"" as he calls the defense team. Read it to get the perspective of this man whose reputation has been totally destroyed in order to allow a double murderer to walk free"
5,Great Detective,"I have read many articles and books and I taped most of the trial of a monster who got away with murder. I read only true crime and have researched a murder trial for an author, and I commend Mr. Furhman on a job well done in describing so many details that most of us not involved with the case would never have known. If all the detectives in the world was half as good as is he, then a lot more cases would be solved. I never believed anything that the defense team and media said about Mark. It was a convenient way for the defense to get O.J. off. My heart went out to him and it still does to he and his family for all that a hard working detective, working to protect us and just doing his job, went through. There were more people that believed in you than not, Mr. Furhman. You should have been the lead detective on the case. Great book!!"
4,Excellent Dectective Work,"I just read this book for a second time, due to the recent episode involving Mr. Simpson. Again, I found it to be excellent, albeit disturbing that such damning information was available but botched in recovery and/or prosecution. Mark Fuhrman was a scapegoat in this trial and I am happy he has perservered to become a successful writer and that he continues to do dectective work."
4,A great source for Native American designs.,"I have read and used this book many, many times. When I was just starting to bead, this book was a wealth of patterns and colors for me. And that was a long time ago. I believe it was written with children in mind, but if you want to see Native American beadwork designs, and the traditional colors that were used, this is the book."
4,Nice book,Nice book with great information and creative patterns. Would have been excellent with additional information and not so many photographs of items made by the authors.
2,Really dated source,"Published during the 1950s, the author's stereotyped attitudes towards native peoples is all to readily apparent, including the names he gives some of the stitches. Some of the pictures are very painful, taken together with the narrative.This is NOT a lost art here, people, & there are Native artists producing both traditional & contemporary beadwork that easily rivals the work of our grandparents.There are much better, more contemporary sources available now. This is ok only as a curiosity from an earlier decade."
4,My Doubts Proved Unwarranted!,"I loved Paul's three major hits and bought them all as 45's. However, since I never heard any more from him, I naively concluded he had no more to offer. This disc pleasantly dispels that notion and shows that he deserved a better musical fate. If his ""Roses Are Red"" had been produced in a manner similar to Bobby Vinton's version, one wonders if Paul might have achieved similar success. An enjoyable cd."
1,Paul Evans and his Broken Kareoke,"It is Horrible. That's all I can think to say. This guy must have used a kareoke--he wouldn't be able tp afford a band and no studio would possibly spring for one. iF SOME OF THE OLD GONE ROCK STARS COULD HEAR THIS THEY'D BE SPINNING IN THEIR GRAVES LIKE PINWHEELS. Iis tone deaf, he accents the wrong phrases and worse he tried to imitate the folks who first recorded it instead of using his own style. Listen to this before you buy. Please."
1,It Really Funny,"This had to be the worse music I ever heard, how can anyone record a CD like this, It has to be a joke, Don't even think of buying this CD."
3,very hard Algebra,"I have a better modern book on invariant theory:Classical Invariant Theory (London Mathematical Society Student Texts),but in 1913 modular group theory wasn't as set in in the wayit was presented, so when he talks of SL(2,p) modular groups, he never gives thereference. The cross applications to Lie groups, graph theory and combinatorial analysiswere not as well established either.If you want to read this book, be ready for heavy algebrawhere you have to make the modern connections on your own.But the used price here is pretty good."
2,Please Update This Study Guide,"Although art history does not change, technology does. This book accompanies CD's, DVD's, or video. The films are dry, lifeless and formatted in prehistoric documentary style, causing even the most interested art students to drift into a drooling stuper. Since 1989 (publishing year), documentary formats have become more exciting and entertaining. Please update this study guide and media sources(16 years later! Hello?), if only to spare poor unsuspecting students hours of bordom and certain regret for having registered for a course that ""sounded interesting,"" but well.."
2,Please Reconsider this textbook!,"I am currently taking this course at my College, it is a ""Course in a Box"" type course that is on 9 DVD's and this is the companion book. Never mind that the course DVD's are very boring and are from 1989, yeah, 1989; but this study guide uses very large/high level words so it does not read smoothly. I have to sit with a dictionary in my lap and look up about 5 words per page. My point is the book is unnecessarily difficult to read and the Media is boring."
5,If only all books were this great!,"This book is exceptional. It is one of those books that rivets your mind; makes you realize how ordinary other books are by comparison.Sentence builds on sentence creating fantastic images making this book a joy to the senses.Doctorow brilliantly recreates the Ragtime era using actual events and people from the time and interweaving with three fictional families;one WASP, Tateh and his daughter who are poor jewish migrants, and Coalhouse Walkers entanglement with the WASP family.I normally condemn books written about the past as 'unauthentic' or 'lacking the realism' of the age discribed. 'Ragtime' and Doctorow show me that I was talking out of my hat! This really is superb. Anyone giving this less than 5 stars must be a green with envy writer wishing they could write like E L Doctorow!"
5,Very unique item,"I enjoy collecting items like this because they are so unique. For many years, I have been searching stores for a thermometer like this, and was very happy when I found some available online.When I received it, I was surprised at its actual size and thought it looked better than the one pictured by the seller. After unpacking it, I immediately put it in place where I could enjoy looking at it everyday.Overall, out of the many decorative items available, I would have to say that the Galileo Liquid Thermometers are ranked high for quality."
5,FRAGILE!!!!!,"Loved this thermometer. I really used the one that I had for many years that got broken. It's very accurate, which is great for indoors in AK! It is such a converstaion piece, as well, and sits right in the middle of my kitchen island. Beware and make notes if you order, though. the ""Amazon"" packing was insufficient and the thermometer was broken inside the tube...and leaking. Amazon was great and refunded my money. I have decided to order the same item one directly from a distributor in hopes that they understand the adequate packing neede for this instrument."
5,guitar stand,this item is of excellent quality and a sturdy piece of equipment. well worth the cost.
3,card-bored,"i was a bit disappointed that it was a cheap cardboard screen, but i suppose there is the fact that there were two. that being said, a lot of the items on the board aren't used (at elast in my campaigns) all too often. and it was a little pricey for what i got. side note: be careful going to kinko's. the one i went to did a shoddy job at laminating."
3,Average Product,"The charts on this DM screen are all you will need to cover your 3.5 bases, but the physical dimensions are not ideal for a dm screen. It's just too short in height."
3,"Cool, but not necessary","Cool looking, but you could do without them. Nice quick info on inside, but again could do without."
1,Don't bother,"I used to stack unused books up for a screen so I was excited when I found this because my makeshift screen usually falls down once per session. The package it's in is even book sized, leading me to believe, logically, that the screen is book sized in height also. However when you open it up you get two screens, each only half as tall as a book (roughly 5 inches tall). You get one screen for d20 modern and one for core D&D. But because of their miniscule size the first time I used it everyone noted that they could see what I was doing behind the ""screen"" before we started, even the person at the opposite end of the table! I taped one on top of the other which does make it larger but I shouldn't have to do that! This ""deluxe"" screen is an incredible rip-off, It's cheaper just to print out the tables you need on one side of a piece of paper, artwork on the other, and just tape it together yourself."
2,"Nice, but pricey","The charts selected for the inside of the screen are surprisingly useful; basically, they selected a lot of the things that most frequently come into play during a dungeon crawl, but that most people wouldn't bother to learn or remember. Things like various item and material hardnesses, common modifiers to AC, various types of actions and whether they provoke Attacks of Opportunity, skills, movement penaltes, light, and auras for both magic and evil/good. The creators were thoughtful enough to include the book and page number for various charts in case you need to get more info. On the downside, as other reviews mentioned it is surprisingly short for a screen, and pretty high-priced considering what you get. Yeah, yeah; you get a bonus D20 modern screen. Wow. I'd say that seven bucks would be a more reasonable price; five if it didn't come with a D20 modern screen."
4,Spooky Thrillride,"Mr. Kimball has written a fast-paced, entriguing story, where characters are not really as they appear. The plot thickens continually throughout the story, and the ending is a bit of a surprize. I read it over two sleepless nights - well done!! Evil comes in many shapes and forms."
4,Astounding book!,This is one of those books that I couldn't help but take my time with. Most books I find myself speed reading through. This book was so well written I had to read it at a slower pace so that I could absorb everything. A very good read.
4,A review of Mouth to Mouth from MY mouth,"I loved Michael Kimball's UNDONE, his second book, because it was a real page-turner. So I was excited to pick up MOUTH TO MOUTH! My only complaint is that I am so tired because I stayed up most of the night wanting to finish it. But it was worth getting exhausted! (Funny how I didn't notice how tired I was when I was reading it!) Kimball is the master of the plot twist. I can guarantee you will not know what is going to happen until the very end. And his characters! I think Kimball plays on the reader's willingness to believe in the inate goodness of people. Well, don't! (I can't say more without ruining the story for you!) My advice? Get the book! But don't open it until you've got a few days' worth of meals ready to put on the table and you are all caught up with the laundry so you won't have your reading interrupted by such mundane chores such as meal preparation, folding clothes, etc.!"
5,looking for unknowns? THIS IS WHERE TO START!,"This book, Mouth to Mouth, is absolutely riveting. At first it moves a little slowly, then it picks you up so you do not want to put it down. If you like suspense and you've run out of talented authors, this is where you need to go. I initially read the book for odd reasons, but with the realistic setting (being from the region it takes place in), to the undeniably complex, yet completely believable and real characters, I am looking forward to reading other novels by Michael Kimball."
3,Erotic Imagery,"Mouth to Mouth is an intelligent, erotic and suspenseful ride into the secrets that tear families apart. However, it's very revolting images are not for the faint of heart. You will appreciate your nice quiet families after this one!"
2,Dated and dry,"Although it is being marketed as if it were a new book, ""The Epic of New York City"" was written over thirty years ago. The author refers to people using antique adjectives such as Jewesses and redskins. He seems shocked that Greenwich Village attracts men who wear their hair long and women who wear it short. The book is also full of small but annoying errors (e.g.: Mayor LaGuardia was not born on Varick Street). The book has not been updated in any way and misleads the reader - McSorley's Ale House has admitted women since 1966, but the book states that it still is an all male establishment. I would recommend anyone interested in the history of New York to find a more current survey."
2,Lacked the energy of the real thing!,"The book was entirely lacking in juicy anecdotal ""grab you by the shorts"" storytelling. It focussed too much on an endless parade of minor political figures who were neither interesting or compelling to read about. It actually bored me with it's endless city hall dealings and backroom political machinations. Where were the stories of all the ordinary, yet colourful men and women who painstakingly built the city brick by soot covered brick. Not in this book!"
5,A man who loves his city,"It was a pleasure to read, more thrilling than most novels I've run across. Since it was published more than 40 years ago it doesn't include any of New York City's most recent history (which might be a good thing), however it is a great book for someone wanting to know about the foundation and development of one of the most interesting cities in the world, told by a man who spent most of his life being an active part of it. Ellis has a great control over the importance he gives to subjects, having to choose extracts from one of the longest kept diaries in the world he has a huge discipline for choosing important events over gossip and anecdotic situations.Perfectly researched, with a quite impartial and objective view of things. It should be an obligation to read it before being allowed into the city."
4,Good read,Good book that kept me turning the pages. A litle disappointed that the rest of the series never got written.
4,Great news,"I read this back when first published, and even though I am not a fantasy, or SF fan, really enjoyed it. Ms Alton has recently updated the novel, and is working on a sequel to it. The updated version should be available soon, and I will most definitely pick up a copy!"
2,Okay... but,"It was an okay book I suppose. It sagged during the middle. I am in Andrea's fiction writers support group, and she is not a very nice person. She puts others down, so that may have cast a shadow over it for me."
4,Good for future doctors...,"As someone from a small town who is in medical school and wants to do family practice, I found this book inspiring. It was reccommended to me by a friend. Some of the stories seem a little exaggerated for good storytelling (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but overall it's an easy and fun read. I read the whole thing in two short afternoons. Definately a must have for anyone considering family practice or anyone considering a medical career in a small town."
5,Entertaining Tales,"This book is full of fascinating and entertaining tales of a doctor's first few years in practice in a rural town as related by consummate story-teller Walt Larrimore. There are high excitement, joy, and sadness all in this little, easy-to-read book."
3,"Wini is obsessive, Montel is hardly in book","This book caught my attention with the beautiful photos of Montel and Wini, but I read thru the book in only 1/2 an hour. I was hoping to hear more from Montel on his work-out regimen since he is a normal, non-body-builder kind of person. But the bulk of this book is written by Wini Linguvic who obviously is a work-out nut. She is the kind of person who spends 5 hours a day in the gym and really doesn't have a sense of what normal people have the time to do or want to do to accomplish their training goals. This book is as good as any other advice book on training, but no better than most."
3,"BodyChange by Montel Williams, Wini Linguvic","I was disappointed in the book. I did not find it usefull for a woman over 50, however it could be usefull for those that are younger. I also did not like Wini's writing style."
2,I Agree With Rehash Comment,"While I respect and admire the man for fighting this debilitating disease, that has little to do with the fact that you can get the same workout information elsewhere. Healthy living takes common sense. To lose weight, consume less calories than you burn. Slowly you will lose the weight. Aerobics combined with some weight training will give you the body you want. Good luck to all."
4,Typo,"In the first sentence of the ""read an excerpt"" on-line info of the ""Training in Color"", there is a typo.Your version says:The core exercises of the BodyChange program nay look simpleYou mean MAY look simple.I haven't ordred the book yet, but I plan to."
3,Exercise - yuk!,I don't like to exercise apparently. I felt I wanted to read this book for myself and see if it was something I could do easily. I liked that they had pictures of the exercises described and detailed instructions for doing them so you don't get hurt. You can't have kids around you when you trying to do these exercises. My son climbed on the medicine ball they recommended and nearly injured himself.
4,excellent book!! It helped me!!!!!,"I bought this book being a little weary of it, My husband told me about the woman who weighed 410 lbs and lost 300 of it using the bodychange program. I decided to give it a try and I lost 20 lbs in the first month. The only thing it needs to make it even better is more nutritional information. Give examples of what foods to eat and exactly what she means by low carbs, what is considered low? I recommend this book to anyone needing to get in shape. all thats needed is a few weights and a swiss ball. Give it a try, you'll see a difference soon."
5,Why not start a good habit?,"We all know it only takes a couple of weeks to make something you do into a habit. Why not make it a good habit?This book has something for everyone. For the beginner, there is inspiration, clear written instructions and great photographic instruction. For the former athlete, there are guidelines to getting started again. For the avid exerciser, there is a back-to-basics reality check.Best of all the authors don't tell you what to eat!"
4,The essential basics plus inspiration,As a fitness trainer I appreciated this book for it confirms the training programs I design for my clientele. Free weights ARE harder--but as Wini says--and Montel as PROOF_-functional exercises bring real life results. There are so many false programs out there-I was happy to see a book with a reality check--in 21 days you can change your attitude! Loved the pictures too--you can clearly see each exercise unlike other books.
3,It lacks nutritional information,"As much as I admire Montel's work and his determination to fight his chronic illness (multiple sclerosis), I cannot rate this book 5 stars.The 21-day program seems doable. The pictures are beautiful and inspirational: Montel and Wini have achieved body shapes most people would die for. Their experiences add a lot to the book, even though I think sometimes they are a little too long. The exercises are tailored for people who can afford a gym membership, or to purchase sets of dumbbells, a Swiss ball, and a reclining bench. The nutritional advice is reduced to the last chapter, and it is not detailed enough. If you really want to get fit and healthy, you need to take care of your spirit, mind and body. That is why I'd recommend Bob Greene's book, ""Get with the program!,"" which offers sound advice to change the way you think about dieting and workout, making it possible for you to succeed in your efforts."
2,not quite what I expected,"After reading this book, it is just not quite what I expected. It's definately not for someone who is very heavy or out of shape. Some of the stuff was inspiring but it just seemed too much for me."
4,Great outline for starting an exercise program,After reading this book I feel the 21 day plan is very do-able. Would have liked to have seen a sample daily log or journal for charting progress and exercises. Planning to start program with intensity right away!
2,Get 'Body-For-Life' and take it 21 days at a time.,"Although I enjoy Montel's show and hold a great deal of respect for him, I would have to say that this book was 90% fluff. There was a lot of hemming and hawwing about this and that without much clear, concise instruction. I think that readers would be much happier with Bill Phillips' 'Body-For-Life.' The one thing that I did like about this book was the idea of a 21-day goal-setting time period. I find that the shorter-term goals with an aim at a longer-term goal seem to work the best. With all of that said, I still think that Montel Williams is a fine example of a human being and a wonderful role model for anybody."
5,Excellent - we loved it!,"I've been looking for something like this to help teach my children about money. I was worried that they wouldn't like it or pay attention, but as a family, we really enjoyed watching the DVD together. Now, we are using a lot of this information to make better decisions with our money."
3,A lot of information for kids to handle all at once,It is a lot of information to take in all at once. My kids lost interest after about 20 minutes. But it is made in segments so you can break it up a bit.
2,Contrived plot and lack of imagination.,"The plot of this novel is contrived. There are a few moderate surprises, but overall, the story is quite conventional. It would seem, also, that imagination ceases outsie of the mind of George Lucas. Can we really expect everything to be ""as angry as a wampa ice creature on fire"" and ""slow as a bantha?"" Can we really expect people to ride around on rancors and tauntauns? Can the authors of these cheesy novels not create any substantially new creatures? The creation of new characters in the novels is noteworthy; however, even here, it would seem strange that the very leaders of a struggling new republic would be sent into dangerous situations every time you turn around -- is there no one else in the universe who can ""save the republic"" but han solo and leia?"
5,Beautiful,This book was wonderful. the story was really intreasting. I also liked how the students think they know everything and even more than the teacher. I saw this in Kyp
5,This book was soooo good!,"I thought this book was excellent. Kyp Durron is such a great character and the end is so exciting you just have to read the last of the trilogy. I especially like Jacen and Jaina and Admiral Daala (who is a woman Imperial, which is great). Read this book!"
5,STAR WARS AT IT'S BEST!!!!!!!!,This book is better than Jedi Search. There's a lot more action and excitement. Exar Kun was one of the reasons I like this book is better. By infuencing Kyp and having him delve dangerously toward the Dark Side was great. I think putting Admiral Daala in Jedi Search made Dark Apprentice exciting.
4,A melee of sci fi entertainment,"This is the sequel to Jedi Search. It is a little dark, and weird, as in the Empire Strikes Back. Well written and some characters from other books show up here, too. This is a good book, and I recommend it."
3,OK,It was ok but it had some prety stupid parts.Like the peaple not seing the importance of Kyp's rampage!I mean there idea that the way you fight wars is to sit on your but and wate for the enemy to blow you to pieces!And he wusnt a murderer.They were in war and he kild the enemy.And Kyp was prety dumb becous blew up about 6or7 stars to get 3 star destroyers was plain stupid.It had dumb parts but it was prety good.
3,Typical Middle Story of a Trilogy,"Back when I was a kid, I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back and not really liking it too much. I was naive, and now have a greater appreciation for the story. Now with Dark Apprentice, I feel the same way as I did when I was young. However, it does a good job in leading up to the 3rd book of the trilogy. I'm almost done with Champions of the Force, and like I felt about Return of the Jedi, it's full of action. Basically you need this book to enjoy the third of the trilogy, and watch-out, all three books reference the original Star Wars way too much."
5,A new Jedi Academy?! Get a grip and get this book NOW!,"When I learned that Kyp had a lot of Jedi potential, hey, I was happy for him. He deserved it, and after a life of mining spice for ten damn years, well, who wouldn't? But I started to get a little concerned when that idiot Exar Kun twisted Kyp's mind. Hey, the kid didn't know any better, did he? Man, I was angry. But I knew that's what he would want so I just cursed under my breath and kept on reading. I always wondered what Kyp looked like, though. They give him a well fitting descripton in the books, but I wish that he had his own story and elaborate on where he came from."
3,I gave this a 3 star rating,I thought this book was okay but it could of been better. It ended bad. I guess the story continues in the third book but I want to find out what happens and they don't have it at my library. Several parts were really stupid and some were interesting
5,Yet Another Amazing Book: READ IT!,"After you read Jedi Search you can't and won't want to stop. This book continues the exciting trilogy. I think it's even better than the last. It is exciting, fast- paced, and there's no way you'll ever be able to put it down. And when you do you'll be mad if you don't have #3 in the Trilogy right next to you because you finished the book and you need to know what happens next... fast"
5,Still reading it...,"I just started it, but I love it. I read the first one and when I finished that, I knew I had to read this one and I was right. I don't really like Daala that much, ""Let's kill everyone!!!!!!"". At least Gantoris can't complain. (People who read this will know what I'm talking about."
2,Lost in Space,"This applies equally to the other two parts of the Jedi Academy trilogy, but Dark Apprentice was perhaps the nadir. Where have the characters been all this time? There is absolutely no growth, most noticeably on the part of our supposed Jedi master, Luke. Emotionally, and in terms of his understanding of his powers, Luke's character seems to have weakened and regressed even 7 (?) odd years after ROTJ (not to mention, over the course of this trilogy). Perhaps this phenomenon is a function of the author's desire to help readers relive the glory days of Star Wars. Or maybe, the author has no concept of what it means to be a Jedi knight. Sadly there is more character development of the twins than any other characters. On the other hand, the basic idea of a jedi academy is fascinating. I only wish the trilogy had spent more time on taking us into that world and not on a cruise through endless rounds of sitcom-ish plot devices and one-dimensional characters"
1,Blah.,"Does it get any more boring than this? I hope not. I've read a multitude of the Star Wars novels, and along with Courtship of Princess Leia, I was totally disinterested in this whole trilogy. I have issues with Lucas creating a second Death Star in Return of the Jedi, but I got over that. When Anderson created a third Death Star Prototype, I got annoyed. I know the Empire is cruel and all, but I seriously think there's only so far an evil empire can go.This trilogy was hard to fathom, even for a science fiction book. It was hard to buy some of the situations that came about. I should have read I, Jedi by Michael Stackpole after this, just so I had the satifaction of reading something spectacular, instead of something I forced myself to finish."
2,yawnnnn!!!!!!!!!! i went to sleep.,"after reading the thrawn trilogy by timothy zahn i was inspired to pick up this series what a disconnected effort , how many super weapons are there in the starwars universe what a copeout another apprentice turns or flirts with the darkside are there no original stories left maybe kevin j anderson and richard hatch could compare notes on how to write really bad prose because the effort here is substandard to say the least dont waste your time get a life and enjoy the sun"
2,Fish in a Barrel,"It's a shame that many of the titles, have not translated into Spanish, and not even subtitles. It would sell more if the producers had in mind, this little detail."
5,Underexposed Neo-Classic,"FISH IN A BARREL, eagerly borrowing from the dark comedy of Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, is an almost flawless new edition to the caper-gone-wrong, one-set, crime comedy/action genre.What sets this movie apart from the DOGS DV clones is its wispy, broad candor -- so almost-self-referential that one cannot help from smiling, nodding the director's approach to otherwise warmed-over subect matter.Look for fantastic and believable performances from director Kent Dalian (""you've been shooting people a lot."" (while holding a cup of Ramen, in tact during a massive shooting spree)) and Jeremy Renner (""It's only been two so far."") Also, Steven Ingle and Arly Jover rock.Big fat reccommendations on this one -- it's fun, it's serious, and then it's fun. If you're into Quentin Tarantino, I think these are the filmmakers to succeed him in hip factor, dialogue, tension, and comedy. FISH rocks!"
4,Nice Guns,"This movie has the right amount of tension and comedy, that is if you like that dark comedic approach. Well, who doesn't? The title doesn't really do it for me, but the content of the movie certainly makes up for it. What's better than four hot guys with guns and diamonds? Nothing, really. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, they throw you a curveball, keeping your fists clenched, your toes curled and you...on the edge of the couch. Grab a beer or two and enjoy!"
4,This Film Rocks!,"This film is a hodgepodge of rich characters and twisting plots and sub-plots. The mood the film stets is earie, funny and hypnotic. This movie grabbed me from the oppening scene and dragged me by the ankle to the explosive ending. I dug it."
5,A rollicking good time,"Loved this movie - it's a quirky little piece of magic, with a definitely unexpected ending and excellent performances throughout. The writing is very tight, and the characters are both accessible and complex on deeper levels."
4,"""Fish in a Barrel"" worth shooting.","This was a reeally cool surprise. It was a great mix of comedy and drama, and the attitude and tone kept you in the characters' bizarre frame of mind. The director and lead actor is going to develop a rep as the zen master of the underworld. The other leads were great as well. This is worth a look if you want great comedy and tense drama; a kind of bizarre marriage of ""Friends"" and ""The Seven Sammuri""."
4,An interesting take on momentous history,"This book gives an interesting insight into a pivotal period in history. The compilation of personal vignettes gives the book an authenticity and human interest focus.While not a scholarly dissertation, I think it addresses the imbalance so often found in more ""scholarly"" works, and it helps to explain what happened in simple, believable fashion."
5,Great book,Typical Capstick in that I can't put it down. Great adventure read laden with Capstick's not so politically correct commentary.
2,Warrior: The Legend of Col Richard Meinertzhagen,"A very disappointing book - it should be subtitled ""a mini biography of Peter H Capstick."" Capstick is arrogant enough to think that the reader will be just as interested in him as the they are in Meinertzhagen! It is not well written as Capstick rambles off on tangents (usually about himself) at very regular intervals. He professes to be an expert where he clearly is not eg he disputes the well known fact that anti-malarial drugs can mask the symptoms of the disease.A great pity that a potentially interesting book has been spoilt by a self interested author!"
1,As expected from Capstick,I only bought one book by Capstick and knew I was never going to buy any more of his books.
3,"For Big Game Hunters, not Meinertzhagen enthusiasts","I stumbled upon this book over Thanksgiving, and thought I would give it a try. I have a great deal of interest in the Expeditionary Forces that left from India during WWI, so I thought this would be a welcome addition towards my understanding of operations in British East Africa. Well to sum it up, it wasnt really. This book is a very superficial biography of Meinertzhagen, using suprisingly very few sources. As noted by earlier reviewers, the book is consistently broken up by narratives of the author's own experiences, which may or may not have anything to do with the story at hand. If you are looking for a serious biography of Meinertzhagen, this is not for you. If you are looking for a light read with no particular substance, this is it."
3,Enjoyable for the Anectdotes,"This is a very bloody book, but so was Africa in the 1890-1920 timeframe - A Post-Bellum backwater - and one wonders why the British or the Germans were there.The best passsages cover Meinhertzhagen as a leader of men - his boldness and his careful calculations, as an intelligence operative and officer - his gaining entry to a Russian fort is hilarious, and his observations of Post-Bellum Africa - where the slave trade has collapsed and the Boer War is over with.In the end, all things written and done by Meinertzhagen must be judged against his role as a British Intelligence Officer - his diary entries, his ""ornithology"", and his whereabouts and actions. The one true constant is his devotion and loyalty to the Empire and his empathy for the downtrodden and unjustly treated.The dispatch of men with ""amateur"" interests is an old, old ruse that reaches as far back as Aristotle's trip to Thessaly if not further."
4,Great Shoes,"These shoes are fantastic! I have gotten a lot of compliments on them. They do hurt if you walk around in them for an extended period of time. They are professional enough for the workplace, yet hot enough to wear out."
1,Question about lyrics,"I would like to know if this cd includes a performer singing the lyrics. I'm looking also for a recording which inlude s other fight songs, such as ""Whiffenpoof"" from Yale and ""ramblin' wreck"" from Georgia Tech, etc."
1,doesn't work for little noses,I bought the 3 oz size for added suction power... not only is there no suction power... it won't even fit in his nose! My son is 6 months old and I have yet to find a decent aspirator!! UGH! This one won't even work on me! No Bueno.
1,The price of this book is not warranted,"I received this book after about 2.5 months. I was eagerly awaiting its arrival. I figured the hefty price for the book was warranted because it MUST contain valuable information that I don't already have. I was mistaken. This book contains a series of scripts, that in this reader's opinion, are not something I would say to any of my clients. I am about half way finished with this book and I'm still looking for the nugget of information that would make this purchase worthwhile. If I don't locate it, the book is going back to Amazon.com. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
4,Using The Witch of Blackbird Pond,"This is a simple, easy-to-use guide for teaching The Witch of Blackbird Pond. It saves time for the already overburdened teachers in that it has the vocabulary, reading comprehension, and tests already built in. Great for junior high."
5,Great Resource,I love this series of literature guides. I find them very useful in and a valuable addition to our home school curriculum. I like that the worksheets and activity ideas are easily adaptable to many grade levels. They also come in such a variety of options that students of all learning types are sure to find an activity or two that will really stick with them and that they will truly enjoy. I like that there are quizzes and a comprehensive test (with answer keys) included in this guide. I would highly recommend this literature guide for The Witch of Blackbird Pond and any other guide from this series.
1,The worst book I've ever read,"I personally hated this book. It was forced reading in my liturature class. The beginning was depressing and boring(not to mention the main character is not too smart). I do not suggest this book to anyone, especially not teachers."
3,OK,These made myself and my husband have low body temps for some reason so we stopped drinking them after few months. We did do a trial test with them and it did make us more sensitive in regards to feeling chilly.
1,TERRIBLE,"This is my second time buying Goji juice from this account. The 1st 2 bottles I bought were red, sweet, and tasted fruity. The 2nd time I bought 2 bottles the juice was orange, tasted like a smokey rotten fruit, and the lable was different. I'm very disappointed because I thought if I bought from the same company, I would get the same product. How do I get my money back for this trash I was sent? I will never buy Goji online again. It's a great product but being stored wrong and sent to the buyer wrong. I'm very upset with my purchase. SUCH a waste of money. DO NOT BUY GOJI ON AMAZON!"
1,I have not received that order--two weeks later.,Two weeks ago the order was placed and it still has not arrived. This was for one small item--not something that should take so long.
2,Quality not stable,"Got 10 bottles from Vitacost about 3 months ago. I mix it with the smoothie and give it to my son. When I finished the first bottle and opened the second one, I found the juice was bad and tasted like vineger. I sent an email to Vitacost but I couldn't return them because it passed one month period. I wouldn't know the juice is bad unless I open it. I've had this juice for 2 years. This is the second time the juice went bad. The first time I got replacement but not this time. You can also see the photos I uploaded."
3,goji gold,"the product is not the one i usually use but it was a good substitution, it was delivered on time and i would recommend it if you are looking for something a little cheaper. It really helped my energy level and i felt really good"
3,Student Review,I thought the book was useful. I used the book in a class with an excellent professor. It helped me a great deal but most of what I learned was learned in the class. The format of the book was easy to follow and you don't need to have any prior knowledge of the language in order to complete the workbook. The text book that accompanies this workbook is a definite must buy if you plan on truly learning the language.
1,Way overpriced,"This is just a workbook. It gives you no information, like the text does. It just gives you exercises. Exercises are good & useful, but it's worth about $10. On my own I would never pay more than that for it. There's alot of other workbooks, just as good, if not better, at a reasonable price."
3,Dos Mundos 4th edition workbook,"pretty good condition first few pages missing, some writing in ink. Definitely usable for adult spanish class"
5,American History Comes to Life,"This is the life story of a late 19th century gunfighter and cattleman named King Fisher. The author has thoroughly researched the history of Southwest Texas, and the growth of the towns, railroads, and local governments.Many of the names which show up in this novel will be familiar to readers. Bat Masterson, John Wesley Hardin, and and Wild Bill Hickok to name a few. The unsung heros of the early Texas Rangers feature heavily in the story.This book can be read for the rich detail about the lives of the cattle ranchers, saloon keepers, lawman and outlaws. The account of a cattle drive from Goliad to Abilene seems so real you can feel the dust in your face.History buffs who enjoy a good story and would like to enrich their knowledge of 19th century Texas will find this to be a good read."
4,awesome!,I simply loved this book mainly cuz it was sooooo sweet. The ploy wasn't all that great but the book was amazing . It's about this couple Patricia and Evan they're happy together but their happiness goes down the drain when Pat's old crush comes back. The rest of the story revolvs around how insecure Evan feels how Pat feels her old feelings coming back.It's a pretty good book. I wouldn't say it's brilliant but it's sweet.
4,Poerty is as Poetry Does,"I read Lisa's poems today, thoughI'm not quite really sure what she said.Either my mind's wondering in or wondering outor else it's completely dead.The visual imagery of oft used miceeclipses intended metaphor,To sense of this make first knead and then bakeAnd consume squares of house-mouse petite four.Free verse about spring, life ,death and De Sadeevoke deeply deep thoughts about time,Though Poe composed madness of opium sadnessI, like Rostand, scream: Ho! For a Rhyme!Poetry is as poetry does what ameaningless pap and contaminator,But can you make a quick buck with a cerebral f..kSnuggled into iambic pentameter?"
2,"18"" version does NOT have a door","I purchased the 18"" version and there is NO DOOR. Researching the product further on other websites I find this height listed elsewhere as a ""walk-over"" pen .. which then goes on to mention that the K-9 Keeper pens have doors! Since I bought it because of the (non-existent) door feature I will probably return it."
3,Cute but kinda uncomfortable,"These shoes are soo cute and look great on, but they aren't very comfortable. So if you aren't used to dealing with the laces around your ankles or the stiff materials on the top of your feet - don't buy these.I only wear them once in awhile in the summer and usually to somewhere where I will be sitting and not walking around all day!"
4,One of the best in Britain,"This album is a real step up for the British music scene. This album has good range of beats and Kano proves he can handle any style with relative ease.My favourite raw songs are; Ps & Qs, Rewind It, Typical Me and Dont Dance no more;However theres a few softer songs for the ladies on here too and Nite Nite feat Leo the Lion and Brown Eyes are definately the pick of those.Although all of these songs are of a high standard the album doesnt get 5 stars due to the fact that I just cant sit and listen without skipping the odd track.I was glad to see Boys Love Girls make it on as a bonus track but its a pity they didnt also include Dont Dance No More (Remix) which is also hot."
5,KANO is awesome.,"this album has some interesting beats, and overall really good production, including some production by another uk rap group, the streets.kano's lyrics are awesome, and his delivery is pretty unique. i am a big fan. i highly reccomend this album."
4,I can't believe this book is out of print!,"I was about thirteen when I read this book, and I loved it! Its about a knight, Gervase Escot, who is on the run after having been cheated from his inheritance by some guy called Sir Bertram de Bors. He is dying from smallpox when he meets Lady Beata at her father's castle gate, he saves her life, I think and she nurses him back to health. He gets a place at the castle without revealing his identity. He and Beata fall in love but they can't be together because she has been promised to the church since birth. Sir Bertram de Bors makes a reappearance at some point and commits another dastardly deed. Gervase is unmasked and must clear his name or die."
1,"Cheap, vile product that was near fatal for my cat.","Applied this to my cat as directed, and within 24 hours he started having seizures, foaming from the mouth, and was hardly able to walk. After a call to the vet, DAWN dish soap bath and a little prayer he came out of it. Never EVER buy this product. It didn't contain a warning that this type of reaction would happen - if It did I would have NEVER bought it."
1,Sergeants SHOULD BE SUED,"SERGENTS GOLD SQUEEZE ON FOR CATS AND KITTENS FLEA AND TICK has poisoned my cats. One is on an IV overnight tonight because of this product. Applied it exactly as stated it is pure poison and you should remove it from your shelves immediately. Our vet has given us multiple examples of cats who were bought in and died from this product. I have to wait and see what happens to mine tonight. I go to your store because I believe you have the communities best interest in mind and am astonished that you would carry such an evil product. 2 cats vomitting,convulsing and basically hallucinating for the last 24 hours because of it. Now one has a blood infection. What I thought was simply the generic version of Frontline or Advantage has proved to be complete evil. I urge you to remove this product from your shelves."
2,cecilia who?,"This book was written to give the reader a sense of what life was like in the Middle Ages and it did, however, the author tried to use the life of Cecilia Penifader as an example-bad choice. There is very little information about this woman (especially to write a book over)and it was a guessing game at what she did or did not do. Without Cecila and her family information this book probably would have been 10 pages shorter and still given the reader a look into life in a medeival town."
1,Don't waste your money...and beg your prof not to include it,"This book was on my medieval history course's required reading list...and it was dreadful. I'm not sure what was hated more...the fact that the author never ONCE cited her research or that she attempted to give her subject a personality without any basis in fact. If you want to know what life was like as a peasant there is a future professor, I would have severe doubts about using this in any course except perhaps historiography. If anyone had turned this book in as a senior thesis, no professor of mine would have accepted it; they would have ripped it to shreds for the lack of citing."
2,"Eudcationally sound, not for fun",This book was recommended summer reading for Advanced Placement European History. I think it will give the students an excellent understanding of Medieval Life for the majority of the population. It was not however an easy read. The organization is by theme rather than chronological and the author references many other texts that high school students and many teachers are not going to have read.
1,So ungodly boring!,"In addition the utter failure to make the text interesting by centering on a character who we have hardly any information about, the writing is horrendously repetitive. Each section will focus on a different aspect of medieval lifestyle but the same information is often restated in a different context. The actual writing is full of repetition and needless filler as well. With more concise writing and efficient organization of information this book, at only 138 pages which seemed to drag on longer than the entire Harry Potter series, could've been shortened to a single chapter in a regular textbook."
3,Valuable information...,"I value Professor Allegard's views because he is a historian, not a biased religionist. His facts and research are immense, but I felt his approach was slightly convoluted. What I mean is that sometimes his train of thought would wander to other topics, or he would allude to another issue not yet presented, only to jump back to topic abruptly. Like I said, his scholarship is very impressive, especially concerning Paul. It is his approach that I found to be less appealing, considering the other books I have read."
2,Jesus: One Hundred Years Before Christ,"Ellegard forcefully puts forward his theory of the mythical Christ, and defends his negativity about the human Jesus. But his proof is thin, generally based upon six documents. Then, he fails to support his theory that the myth of Jesus Christ was based upon a reality of the two century earlier Teacher of Righteousness of the Dead Sea Sect."
4,A classic text on Luther and Worship,"Written by Vajta, a Hungarian Lutheran and first director of the Lutheran World Federation Dept. of Theology, this work was originally published in 1958. Table of contents: Intro; Principles of Worship: Worship and Idolatry, Beneficium and Sacrificium; Worship as the Work of God: the proclamation of the Word, the Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, The Office of the Ministry as Impartation of the Gift of God; Worship as the Work of Faith: Faith and Worship, The Priestly Sacrifice of Believers, Faith (Freedom) and Love (Order) in Worship.An interesting work that I am glad is being reprinted."
3,not as universal i would have liked,"If you have a D200, and only a d200, its a great way to protect the body against some dings and scratches. However I have the battery/grip attachment and protecting against superficial scratches is less important to me than doubling/tripling my battery life. The armor doesn't fit right with the batter grip attached, so I don't use the armor anymore. Too bad as it fit so well, and makes the camera easier to hold onto by the end of a day of shooting."
4,Camera Armor Review,"The rubber covering for the camera seems to be strong and lasting, though it does take away from the overall ease of using the camera buttons and switches. It requires a little more effort to operate. I would recommend this product to those who are using your camera outdoors; for wedding or portrait shooters, its a little overkill. I have been a photo enthusiast for over 20 years and have not seen a similar product. I am happy with the product and I do recommend its purchase."
2,No Way To Attach,"I bought both the battery grip armor and the camera armor for my Nikon D200. Separately, the armor fits the grip and the camera just fine, though, not snug enough. Installing the grip with an armor to the bottom of the camera also with an armor is a complete nightmare. There is just no way to attach the grip to the camera body as the grip bolt is to short to reach the camera.I have sent an email weeks ago describing the problem to get a solution to the manufacturer but I still need to receive a reply."
1,Body Armor is too thick for camera with additional add on.,This armor did not fit my D200 with extrabattery add on(SB-d200). Do not get this product if you have an add on module for dual battery!!!!.
4,D200 CAMERA ARMOR,"This armor makes me fill safer (against accidental hits. It allows to operate the camera with , say 90% of convenience compare with unarmed camera. Cost of the armor & protection value are adequant."
5,Moving and thought provoking,"Others have described the content of the movie accurately so I won't belabor that again. But I do want to say that I think Laura Flynn Boyle's acting is superb as with the rest of the cast. It is a sharp contrast of the sensitive side of human nature against the insensitive side and glimpses of the confusion that exits between the two in many people. It is profound in its study of human sexuality and attraction at opposite ends of the spectrum. A seriously ill, somewhat angry and lonely woman on the one end and party animals on the other. The film does not lack for poignant moments and you have to brave through some outrageously chauvinistic elements to enjoy the sublime points in the film when human caring and true affection show up. I actually saw this film years ago and still recall its effect clearly. Great stuff. Enjoy!"
1,nothing concrete to grab on to,"I found this short little book to be wordy, murky and unclear. No one knows how thought/meaning is conveyed in the brain. Freeman suggests that chaos, transistions, and repeating patterns have something to do with memory, learning and meaning, and that context is important, but so what. Those ideas have been suggested before, and I didn't find any highly compelling new arguments, either theoretical or experimental, in support for how or why these particular ideas should be correct. There are some interesting tidbits here and there when he explains some experiments in the field."
1,Not very good,"Although I have tremendous respect and admiration for Bill Bright, this book is very poorly written. The villian is delicious, but the other characters are weak and simply chase each other around through most of the book. The ""Holy Spirit on Trial"" part of the book is short and incidental to the plot. The conclusion is totally predictable. While the first few pages of the book are engaging, that's as good as it gets. Take a pass on this one."
5,Hardcover - used but in good shape,"Took a little while, but within expected time. In fine shape even though used. Gift for a strong Christian Lady"
2,"Should be titled ""Treasure hunting"", not wreck diving","I was very disappointed with this book. Most of it deals with how to strip and preserve wreck artifacts, rather than how to safely dive wrecks. If stripping portholes from wrecks is your bag, this is the book for you."
3,Good Book,"This was an informative book that I will probably consult again when it comes to preserving artifacts. I expected more on the subject of how to safely wreck dive but instead found more on the subject of what to expect from wreckdiving. I still found the text readable and will use it to select gear and preserve artifacts but would not recommend it as a guide to wreckdiving. Good book which contains valuable information, just not the info I was looking for."
4,...but is it Acqua Di Gio?,"So when my 3.4 oz bottle of Acqua Di Gio ran dry a few weeks ago after having used it almost exclusively for the past decade, I knew it was time to move on to another scent. But I also wanted to keep a similar smelling cologne around just for nostalgia's sake.Enter Mascolino...When I did one spritz of Mascolino on my neck last night it smelled nothing like Acqua Di Gio. However, as the night wore on I became slightly confused as the familiar fresh citrus scent I had grown to love so dearly returned!So yes...Mascolino is a suitable substitute for Acqua Di Gio but it's immediate, first high concentration spritz remains unfamiliar.Of course, I'll use it a bit more and have a final verdict but I remain positive =]"
1,HONEST REVIEW,This product smells NOTHING like the real thing... AT ALL!! after reading the reviews and using the same brand body spray for about a year now this purchase was a no brainer. Big mistake. The body spray under the same brand smells EXACTLY like aqua di gio. This on the other hand does not. In anyway. Form. AT ALL! save your money and buy the body spray at. Walmart for $2.80
5,Great fragrance,My dad and brother both love this cologne. They both are now on their 3rd bottle and are pleased with the quality.
4,very close to the real thing.,"Great product.Very very very close to the real thing, the only problem is it only last about 1/3 to 1/2 as long as the real deal.But that's ok for the price!!"
2,For Dedicated Punk Fans Only,"The poor sound quality on most of this album ruins some good performances by some very good bands. The liner notes describe how the master tapes used to make this album were in terrible shape and had to be put through some kind of baking process in order to be usable. Frankly, I don't think it was worth it. The best recordings are the ones featuring the Alleycats, and I like this band a lot -- their music has a New-York-punk kind of sound. Next in recording quality is the F-Word performance, incuding the classic ""Do the Nihil."" The problem with the X recordings is that they are such a great band that listening to their performance being defiled by this terrible sound quality is almost painful. For a much better live X recording, get ""X - Live at the Whisley A-Go-Go."" The Zeros tracks are problably the worst in sound quality, which is also a shame since they too were a really good band."
2,Disappointed....,"I purchased this study guide to help prepare me for the American Government Clep Exam. Though the guide was fairly thorough in covering the topics that it outlined, I believe that it failed to cover the brunt of material found in the exam.I was disappointed to find out that even though the guide touched on most of the topics in the exam, it failed to cover the material in-depth enough to properly prepare someone to answer most of the questions.With that being said, I did pass the Clep Exam, but I only passed with a 58 (a score of 50 is passing, 80 is perfect). If the exam had not been packed with almost 20 questions about graph and chart interpretations, which had little to do with politics, I am sure I would have failed. Thank God for the easy questions.Anyhow, I would recommend that anyone searching for a comprehensive American Government Clep study guide search elsewhere. Good luck with your tests, and I hope you find a better study aid than I did."
1,Too Basic,I bought this book hoping it would be the only thing I would need to pass the test. Well I was way wrong. There is no way that I would of been able to pass the test just by using this study guide alone. Overall this purchase for me was a complete waste of money. If you want to get good info to help you pass the CLEP exam I strongly reccomend that you look somewhere else. Don't waste your money on this junk.
1,Pretty much worthless,"This ""book"", which is really only a couple dozen pages, was written by a University of Phoenix employee and quickly runs through the core of US Government. Many of the main facts are mentioned, though nothing essential is explained; detail is far from the manuals forte. There are lists of the Amendments, all abbreviated, and so too are lists of some of the major Supreme Court cases. This means that you'll have an idea of what is/was entailed, annnd that's about it. I received a stapled printout practice exam with this that appeared to have once been a part of the manual (or was being added). In it were several questions on things not covered nor hinted in the rest of the materials. All in all, the best advice that was written on its pages was to find other resources."
1,No Help At All,"I too purchased this book and received an emailed PDF format. I used this ""study guide"" as my main source of information and as a result miserably failed the exam. (I got a 38)DO NOT BUY!"
1,Awful!,"If you want to to be unmotivated and not go snowboarding, this is the video for you! Half of the movie is the snowboarders of the Burton team complaing how snowboarding is a chore and how life is hard. The other half is stock footage from the olympics in incredibly boring slow motion. Yes, Shaun White can rip with the best. Yes, Jeremy Jones can shred things that probably aren't supposed to be ridden. The riders in this video are amazing. Unfortunately, this video is about as fun to watch as atrip to the dentist office. They didn't even have DCP in there. If they did, it was bare minimum. I would Suggest any Mack Dawg video or better yet the Think Thank videos (ie; Thanks, Brain). Overall, the Burton movie was un-motivating, whiny and is more of a soap opera than a snowboarding video."
2,ok BUT..,"this is an ok look at the lives of some of the Burton riders BUT they spend most of the time complaining about how hard snowboarding and life are.Most of the boarding footage is from the olympics in slow motion and boring as can be.This was unmotivating, actually it makes you want to AVOID snowboarding. I guess sowboarding isnt what it used to be, since big businesses got into it :("
3,good,i'm a gap jump guy and this has almost nothing as far as that goes. it attempts to tell a story rather than just be a montage of different people and different tricks at different locations. it could also have been titled shaun white goes to the olympics. plenty of pipe action.
3,"Good game, though dated.","Great game, but I see why this one isn't included in the modern BattleChests like Diablo is. This one is from an early generation, probably the worst thing is when building guys you cannot queue them up.Still, a fun game."
1,poor,"the game doesnt work on windows vista, no where on the web site did it say it wouldnt work in vista, and now i have the game and cant play it, nor can i send it back!!!!"
2,"BUT, What About..............???","Dumb & Dumber??? KINGPIN????? How could you POSSIBLY call this a Farrelly Collection without these two gems- only the best two films they made! ""Mary"" had it's moments, but loses you towards the end. ""Irene"", aside from an occational laugh (the sons were HILARIOUS!!!) was average at best. And ""Hal"" was WAY too sweet for the likes of a Farrelly movie. I literally ROARED the first time I saw ""Dumb & Dumber"" & ""Kingpen"" and wore out several gears in my VCR from the constant rewinding to catch what I missed during the laughter. This box set makes as much sense as DVD box entitled ""The Ultimate George Lucas Collection"" with only American Graffitti & Howard the Duck. Too bad."
1,Perverted Sicko Degenerates,"The Farrelly Brothers are perverted sicko degenerates. I had a sick feeling after watching ""Shallow Hal"" and ""There's Something About Mary"". Do not buy these sick movies and do not let your children or anyone else you care about watch them."
1,Useless,"I am an illustrator and when I got this book I was hoping to learn from it. In my opinion this book is about a few has-beens giving their opinion on their own jobs. Boring!There is a lot of artsy fartsy talk that only someone who doesnt live in the real world could understand. The kind of talk im talking about is like ""The plastic bag flying in the wind is beautiful"". pfft."
3,Dated,Dated information about China's communist government. Nothing special and covers lots of complicated information in to short of space. OK for a superficial introduction to this subject in past years
3,Came up short...,"This book was only mediocre to me. It seemed like it was written by someone young and inexperienced. I've read other Triple Crown Productions books...this seemed a little bit too...""light"". I expected the book to be a little more on the ""raw"" side. It was a good book though. The whole ""using your mind instead of violence"" is nice and all...just too ""after-school special"" for me. I'd read the author's works in the future though."
2,Not the 70's Goofy Greats from K-Tel!,I was also looking for the CD version of the classic Goofy Greats record from K-Tel which was made in the 70's and this CD doesn't even include of a third of the songs which were on that album. Some of the songs on that original album are practically impossible to find anywhere else. I really wish K-Tel would just re-issue the original record in CD format.
1,Sliced 'n Diced Classics & Crappy Re-Recordings,"K-Tel is the worst. I've learned the hard way that any product by them is utter crap, and this one is no exception. The suck fest begins right away with a truncated version of the Shang's classic ""Leader of the Pack"". For some mind-boggling reason (Just to ruin an awesome song? Because someone pissed in their Kool-Aid?) they decided to cut certain lines out of this pop masterpiece, a song that certainly should not be messed with. On top of that, several cuts on this album are NOT the originals, but are crapola re-recordings by choice members of the original bands and a mixed-bag assortment of session hacks. Caveat emptor! When you see the K-Tel logo, run the other way as quickly as possible."
1,Do it right,"Actually, I already have this album on cassette that I recorded years ago from the original 33 1/3. I had hoped to get a clean CD, but based on the other reviews it seems to be a waste of time. Instead, I've got a very good program that will let me create a CD and eliminate a lot of the noise in the process. That seems better than buying this."
1,The Diary of Anne Frank play,"I am writing to inform you about how horrible this play is. I am asking you not to waste your time reading this play. I find this play not interesting enough to get me hooked on it. Anne Frank lived in an old era. I can not relate with Anne Frank because I/we live in a modern era. I did not like the way Anne acted with her mother. She should have been nicer to everyone in hiding.The authors should have had more action scenes and more love scenes. The authors should have also included the death's of each character. Finally, the authors should have written Mr. Frank's point of view during his time in the concentration camp."
1,Warning: Do Not Read This Play!,"""The Diary of Anne Frank"" is inappropriate to read, I have seen newborn babies write better plays. The characters are dumb because they never go to the bathroom to wash themselves. It would be a waste of money (any amount) to buy this play. It's not even the full story - they leave out the parts about the concentration camps!"
2,bad recommendation,No I dont recommend this play to any one because its kind of boring and what i dislike about this play is that at the end every body dies except for Mr. Frank he is the only surviver.The only part that i would like to change would be at then end when every body dies thats the only part i would change.
3,My opion of Anne Frank,Yes i recommed the play because I think it was a nice story. The part of the play I like is that when she first met peter. I dislike when she caught her attuide with her mother. The part I will change is that how they had to be in hide out.
2,Anne Frank the Book,"My statement of purpose is to dissuade. The story has good parts and bad parts, mostly bad parts. Even though it is bad it is historical and can teach you.The historical and learning parts are the only good parts. The play doesn't tell about the concentration camps. The play doesn't tell how the families died or when. The play stops as soon as they get caught. In conclusion the play isn't that good."
4,"""Anne frank a strong little girl with big problems"".","I'm trying to persuade you to read this book because it tells you how the Jewish people including Anne had to hide when the ""Nazi's, and Hitler"" were coming. Also I think you should read it because it has a lot of historical moments, like the Halocuast which means ""burnt hole"".I could have done everything Anne did because she could argue but I do not like the way Anne argued with her mother. Anne had a thing that she always wanted and that was her diary when she got it she was happy. The only hard thing that Anne did that I could not do was adjust to having another family live in a little house."
4,"Good play, better essays","I had to read this book for college, and I really recommend it to people. This play has a realism about it that really opens your eyes to the suffering of those in hiding during WWII. However, what I really liked were the essays in the back, especially the story of one young gypsy man, a group whose story does not get told very often. Overall, I like this book and would recommend it to anyone."
4,ELMER KEITH'S BIG GAME HUNTING This is a very hard to find book,"This is a very hard to find book,and to find one in this good of condition is even better."
4,She's Dead...,"If you're looking of the original riot grrl head straight for this compilation and The Eyes. Screaming ""She's Dead"" and thumping her bass (clad in a baby doll, torn fishnets and stilleto's) while singing about Quaaludes is Charlotte Caffey of Go-Go's fame. Caffey and her band The Eyes (drummer DJ Bonebrake left the band after this show to join X and Caffey departed for the Go-Go's) had incredible fun with punk. Imagine Hole meets the Barenaked Ladies and you'll come close. This is what LA punk is all about."
3,A good game for kids,"This is a good game for small kids because small children will love this game. In this game we play with four characters, they are listed below:1. Lion (Alex)2. Zebra (Marty)3. Hippopotamus (Gloria)4. Giraffe (Merlin)I have listed goods and bads of this game below:Goods -- Not much high system requirements.- Easy to play.- Good game.Bads -- Bad graphics.In this game we also play with the penguins."
5,Fun,"A fun yet challendging game. I enjoy it very much. I haven't seen the movie but I'm guessing it's good cause the game is. I would still rather see Star Wars Eposode III revendge of the sith, but who cares"
2,I didn't like this product.,The phones have an echo/cheap sound. No voice caller ID. The seller wanted a 15% restocking charge for me to return an item I don't like. Read the return policys before buying. I wish I did. I will never buy again without an unconditional full refund guarantee.
1,Horrible,"This is the most horrible product I've ever bought. The sound quality is horrendous at best. It is very staticy, and the volume is low. I was very disappointed as I've bought Uniden's before and they were good. I really recommend staying away from this phone and paying a little more money for a better version. I'm not sure what the other reviewers were using or if they worked for company, but trust me when I say they suck."
4,Dual Source Speaker Selector,"This proved to be good product, fairly simple to hookup, the dimensions (front wide) match up to standard HiFi system so it looks very well in combination. The wire connectors at the rear are removable for ease of connection, these connectors could be little larger to give you more space in between the neighboring wires to minimize any accidental shorts.No distortion on the music output, music reproduction as good as the speakers. You do lose little volume when the safety switch is engaged, not a deal breaker as you can compensate by raising the volume level on your amp.I would recommend this product."
3,Missing parts.,We have found the hinge to hold the tank was missing. We need to request the parts from the manufacture.
1,"Unusable, Right out of the Box . . .","So after literally decades of good experiences with the Haws 7500 and 7501 eye wash stations, one of our guys decided to take a chance on this unit. Not only was the instructional placard mounted upside-down(!), the manufacturer neglected to drill the drain hole in the fold-down catch basin.Fortunately, we could fix both of these defects here in the shop. There are much better options for eye wash stations than this substandard product from China."
2,Horrible,This eye wash station worked great until I refilled it. Somehow it developed a hole in the plastic and slowly leaked all the water over 1 day. I would not recommend this product because it is not well-built of sturdy plastic and develops holes too easily.
2,4 out of 4 leaked,Four out of four of this model developed leaks at the wall bracket mounting points. No response has been issued by the manufacturer at this point. Would not recommend this unit.
5,ROCK ON 09,"I already wrote a review earlier and see it isnt here?? So I am doing so again! This is a great remake of ROCK ON, you should check it out!! (Sounds real good blared in your car!!)"
4,Does what it's supposed to,"First of all, it's an fm modulator. Sound quality is going to be the same as a clear radio station, never better. Second, they've done pretty well trying to eliminate the interference, but I still get a faint ""whine"" that's barely audible. But, this doesn't interfere too much.My only gripe would be that it didn't include any antenna adapters. I installed this in a 2007 Malibu and needed 2- one for the input side, one for the output.All-in-all: I like it and recommend it for listening to ipod/mp3/whatever on your car radio that doesn't have any input connectivity."
4,It works,"Got this to hook up my old soundblaster Zen to my older Alpine CDM-7874 deck. Connects easily, and the wires are long enough to place it just about anywhere in your car. The only problem i had is the antenna connection was a little small for the deck, so I had to get creative with some electrical tape and all is good. There is a bit of a hiss at higher volumes, but other than that, i have no problems. Is it as good as a deck with an AUX input, no, but it works for what I need it to do. I can even pick up radio stations quite decently. A good solution when you don't want to spend a bunch of money on a new deck."
5,"Great product, installation a little tricky for beginners","You may need some crimping tubes or other wiring stuff to install this. I am a total beginner at anything related to car stereo systems and wiring. Most of it was straightforward--the only difficulty for me was finding and rerouting 12V to the unit. I was cocky and tried to install it without any research or thinking, and I ended up making a big mess of things. Once I looked up what I was supposed to do and got the stuff I needed (both to install the modulator and fix my mistakes), the thing worked perfectly. It's a great alternative to an FM transmitter in that it's cheaper and has better sound quality."
3,Normal FM Reception Terrible,"Sounds great after I installed it in my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Sound quality is better than I expected. Pretty easy to install, took me less than an hour. Not sure if I did something wrong or if it is a product defect but now I only get strong FM stations and no AM stations anymore. I now receive less than 10% of the stations I received before. When given the choice to listen, IPOD or radio, I am going with IPOD and keeping this product.I would like to have my AM and FM radio back eventually. I have already double and triple checked all antenna connections. I wired the unit to my cigarette lighter for power and it is good. The radio doesn't work at all if I turn the unit on, so yes I did turn it off. If you have an idea of what I did wrong please comment on this post. Thanks!"
2,Tried many,The product description sets you up for high expectations but it really doesn't work... Shampooed daily and used the entire bottle... got better results with lower cost products.
3,Landlord forms cost extra,"The CD in my book does not have landlord forms, but instead directs to [...] to purchase the forms with no discount from the regular price. The titles for free additional material worth ""over $100"" are ""healthcare and planning guide"", ""identity theft"", ""stopping junk mail"" and ""time and money"". It will cost me about $[...] to download the forms I need from the Socrates website, in addition to the cost of the book."
2,"Spoiled after ""Montrose""","In my opinion, ""Montrose"" was the pinnacle. Respect for Ronnie's ability, yes, but the riffs and hooks, e.g. Bad Motor Scooter, Space Station #5, just are not present on this CD."
3,Montrose + Electronics,Lean hard rock with an electronic chaser. Ronnie Montrose's muscular guitar gymnastics really propel most of the songs on this initial Gamma release. Excellent music but mediocre lyrics and singing. Great cover art. For hardcore guitar fanatics.
3,Don't give up yet...,"My mouse worked right out of the box. Two weeks later it seemed to have a mind of its own. It wouldn't track and seemed to be stuck going up. I reinstalled the software and rebooted several times. Just as I was getting the original packaging out to return it I decided to read the previous reviews again. I have to thank the ""bridge addict"" above. As a last resort I took the batteries out and put them back in and the darn thing works again!! Even though the unit was still emitting the red laser light, taking the batteries out then back in did the trick. Otherwise it works very well and is priced right."
3,Thats it?,I thought this book was going to be great but it was just aight to me. This book seemed a little rushed...I would have at least liked it more if there was some type of relationship with Desiree and Stacks but there was no type of relationship...she was nothing more than a jumpoff. Also there was too many characters that I just didn't care about and wished the story would have concentrated more on Stacks and Desiree.Everything just happend way too fast. This book had potential to be great but it seems like the author just rushed to get to the climax by adding POV's from different/unimportant characters and without developing a relationship between the two main characters. Maybe I was looking for a love story with betrayal and tragedy but all I got was a story about sum crazy scorned gold diggers and lame huslters who are blinded by p****. If thats what your looking for then buy this book...if not borrow it.
5,An Excellent Read!!!,"A dear friend of mine lent me this book to read, and I started reading and couldn't stop. I stayed up all night until I was done. If you don't have this book, pick this up immediately!!! My girlfriend made it perfectly clear this was one book I could not keep...her autographed copy...and I understood why she felt that way when I finished it...it has been said not once, not twice, not three times, but many times, we just couldn't put it down...with every page I just had to keep going...I was like the ernergizer bunny that night...I kept going and going, and I must say I was truly satisfied when all was said and done. When people ask me what you read lately...I tell them go get ""Down in the Dirty, by JM Benjamin...tipping my hat to ya JM!!!"
4,Brilliant approach to the literature of exile,"Gombrowicz's take on the generally painful experience of exile is an artful combination of the particular and the universal. The novel's comic tone seems a historically and culturally specific attack on hackneyed Polish nationalism. Yet Trans-Atlantyk manages to raise greater questions of literature's ability to do justice to 20th-century horrors such as WWII. The translation is a work of art in itself -- for those who can't read Polish (such as myself), you will not be bothered by that fear of a mediated, second-rate experience so common to mediocre translations. To the contrary, the language of this translation is unbelievably rich. Indeed, do not let the richness scare you off -- the style becomes easier to digest as the novella moves forward. Enjoy..."
2,another 101 uses for dead cats type of a book,It was a waste of money. Maybe they all should have gotten loaded before doing the project.
5,My dentist recommended it when I had an upper plate put in.,"This stuff is great in holding a plate in place all day long. I would recommend using a spray bottle of water after sprinkling powder on plate, then put in place. This makes it hold immediately."
4,Curious Buy,"I'm happy I purchased this product, I hope it will serve it's purpose well. It came two days after order, which was impressive and it was actually more than I'd expected. I was thinking I'd get some little trial package or something but I feel I'll get many uses. Happy customer"
3,nothing different,"This product doesn't carry much from the rest. You have great hold til you have a couple of drinks. Most break down after just a few hours.., This one included."
4,Picturing Mary,"Great dvd, takes you ""around the world"" to explore Mary in art through many different cultures."
3,Kirkus Is Right On This One,"It's not that the effort wasn't there or that the subject wasn't interesting but the style was rough. It does seem gushy at points and is a jumble of facts. I love Huizenga's story and do think the book is a worthwhile read, but the lack of smooth flow in the storytelling is distracting."
4,You will treat your trash man diffrent after reading this.,I liked the book really well. I was suprised that Wayne was completly a self made billion-aire. When other guys like Donald Trump was in private school wayne was doing odd jobs to earn money. I just wish I had invested in Blockbuster when I was in high school.
1,Beware,This product looks much better on the website than in person. The gold trim looks cheap and the suede (if it really is suede) looks very inexpensive.
2,Not Good For Acoustic Drums,"If you play acoustic drums, then these sticks aren't a very good choice. When I used these sticks, they literally disintegrated as I played with them. I would recommend a higher quality drum stick, because you'll eventually have to replace these sticks soon after you get them."
5,rare music,This is one of those recordings that hasn't made it to other media. Mysterious and soothing--like a foggy hot spring in Iceland.
4,Fantastic CD,"I am VERY pleased with this CD and am interested in a simular record I had as a child. It included ""tip toe through the tulips"", ""theyre comming to take me away ha ha""(excellent song) plus ""the witch doctor"", ""little red riding hood"", ""shaving cream"", and the ""hello muda, hello fada...""song. If anyone knows where to find this album(by various artists)I would LOVE to have it."
5,So fun!,I grew up with this TAPE and now bought the CD for my little boy. It's the best! He gets so excited by several of the songs. I know he'll love it even more when he's older (he's just 2) and can understand the humor. But he loves the energy of it. I'm so glad they are still selling it!
4,An excellent debut by a new artist in the area of World Musi,"World Music can often be a hotch-potch of styles but Mr.Wubbenhorst has managed to avoid that in his recording debut. A flutist, who plays both the Western instrument and the Indian bamboo flute or bansuri, Wubbenhorst works with a variety of Western and Indian instruments to create a new and exciting sound. The rhythmic basis of the music, generated by Indian tabla player Sandip Barman is particularly interesting. On top of this, Wubbenhorst layers a variety of colors and patterns, and at the very top, gives us flute improvisations with a mixture of jazz and Indian influences. The end result is a sound that is clean, fresh and invigorating, leavened with moments of meditative serenity that the bamboo flute is beautifully suited for. This is a fine debut. If you enjoy jazz, World Music or any similar genres and you are a little jaded by the sameness of current issues, give Facing East a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised"
1,pricey paper airplanes,"The product arrived bent out of shape. It didn't mail well. But, it really didn't matter, I did not expect to spend nearly $30 on paper airplanes. It smacks of ripoff."
4,Arthur Gets a Job,"I like this book! Today was a very special day for D.W. My favorite part was when she had to go past the Tibel twins' house. There, they were jumping all about yelling, ""D.W. is our favorite person."" D.W. gasped. She grabbed Arthur yelling, ""I'm too young to die!"" ""It's ok, D.W. You'll be safe,"" Arthur said. I think you should read this book because it is funny."
5,Barbie's groom doll for Jenny,"My little girl, who played with Barbie Dolls is now getting married. Jenny had many Barbie dolls and outfits, never introduced her to Ken. Now Jenny is getting married at age 22 and I purchased the groom Ken to stand beside Barbie, both in wedding attire. My daughter and her fiance look like the blonde barbie and black hair Ken. Had the two dolls standing side by side at the bridal shower. Everyone thought it was a cute touch.Wedding is Aug 27th, 2005"
2,Not quite what I expected.,I am in the process of building/designing an art studio. This book did not give any help or direction that I was wanting.
3,Nothing compared to 100 Broken Windows,"These last two albums from Idlewild have been such a let down. 100 broken windows was perfect, now I just don't understand the crap they play. But it's still better listening than most other rock around. I wish they'd get it together and try to be more original."
4,The book looks brand new!,I was very satisfied with the book...but I requested for it to be shipped in 2 business days it was received a day or two days later. that is the reason why I rated 4stars and not 5.
4,Book is good at explaining concepts,Got this book for my Sociology 101 class and it is fairly easy read and does at great job at explaining concepts. My teacher takes everything right from the book so if I study the book I will get an A. Great book though!!!!
2,Imbalanced,"This book does a great job of looking at sociology from the Conflict perspective. However, as a student forced to take this course by the university I attend, I have some issues with the so called attempt by the authors to provide a balanced perspective. Being relatively conservative in my philosophical outlook, I cannot help but note that much of the factual tone taken by the authors in this book reeks of deception. There are numerous purported ""facts"" stated by the authors, as well as statements intentionally designed to appear factual, that are anything but factual and subject to debate depending on the perspective undertaken while studying the issue. The title of this book would be more accurate if simply called In Conflict. While a decent introductory book compared to some of the others I've had to read, the biased nature of this book does not merit it sufficiently enough to be considered an excellent and balanced look at the perspectives in sociology."
3,"Great for baby, not so good for Dad","What would I do without my Hotsling? My 9 week old baby has loved the closeness of being in the sling from the very beginning. When she fusses, this is the only sure way to get her calm and sleeping. With her cuddled up close to me in the sling, I can get work done around the house, go shopping or take a walk. My baby isn't comfortable in the Baby Bjorn yet, so the sling is an absolute lifesaver.There are two drawbacks of this sling:1. It is not comfortable to wear for long periods of time. After an hour or so, my back is starting to hurt.2. It is not adjustable, so my husband can't use it. It seems ridiculous to have to buy another $40 sling for him.Next time, I might try an adjustable sling so that my husband and I can both use it."
2,Uncomfortable sling,"This sling is just a piece of cloth in the shape of a sling. Very uncomfortable for my baby. I found a much, much cheaper one at Wal-Mart that is better than any name brand sling. My baby will only take his naps in the Wal-Mart sling."
4,A Great Reference Source,"More like an encylopedia than a dictionary, since each topic is the subject of a short essay. A great book to open a page and random, and see what you'll learn. Eight appendices suggest Mary-oriented Bible passages (not just direct biography, but also many Old Testament passages), and provide a chronology of Marian events in the history of the Catholic Church."
5,I love these!,"I do NOT usually go to the doctor for antibiotics as they are over used the infections they are supposed to fight become tolerant of them and they become useless. So, whenever I start to feel sick, I take these. I just had a bronchial infection that was pretty bad, I was coughing up some pretty nasty stuff. I was taking 16 of these a day for about a week, and by the end of the week I was feeling back to normal. DO NOT just stop taking them though! Ween yourself off of them, if you just stop taking them all at once, you WILL get sick again, sometimes worse than reason you were taking them in the first place! I have taken these for years and I have yet to come across an infection that has an immunity to them, I use them as needed when I feel sick, but you can take them daily to prevent sickness too if you work in a doctor's office, daycare, hospital, or somewhere there is a high risk of catching a bug."
5,Perfect for the Amateur Gardener,These have proven to be perfect for my roses. I have used 50 and have just placed an order for another 25. A Sharpie pen works fine on them.
2,not so good,"This is a movie for the inexperienced. It's got a sweetness to it, but is so elementary that I couldn't watch it through to the end. The characters are a little over-done, makeup, clothes, acting. Not deep, not intelligent, not meaningful. Just a film to take up a little boredom-time."
3,St. Louis vs. St. Louis--a disappointment,"I looked forward with anticipation to this one and only all-St.Louis World Series. $16.95 plus shipping was too much for twenty some minutes of ""lowlights"" of the World Series. Very little of the 6 games were shown, leaving out footage of Stan Musial (except for one homer). Far too much for so little."
4,Good fit,it has a good fit for my ankle lenth dreads. Quality craftmanship. I have worn it a few times and it still holds it's shape.
5,Malcom In The Middle - First Season Purchase,"The service for this transaction overall was great! I ordered it and it was at my home within five days. It's also worth mentioning that I am on the opposite side of the country from where it was shipped. Not only was the service quick, but the product itself is good, too. It's brand new and works great. It was very inexpensive compared to other places on the web."
5,GRRRRRRRRRRRREAT,In this 3 disc Boxed set you we get all 13 original season 1 episodes for your viewing pleasure. This is a great show and season BUY it NOW!!! And please sign the petition to release the second season too!!!PLEASE!!!IM DYIN HERE!!!
1,HURRY THE F*** UP,"Hurry up and release malcolm in the middle season 2, i know why you aren't releasing it, get the problem sorted out and clear all the music costs, ffs there are a ton of people that literally worship this show, it's reasons like this why people are reduced to pirating things, so hurry up and get all of the seasons released to dvd."
1,malcolm in the middle first season,"poor video quality, dvd holder broken causing discs to get scratched. will be returning product."
3,funny-but,"I had never watched much of the series, but my sons said we should get them, so I did. Some of them are too much for me, but overall funny. (we have six sons so can relate to much of the content, but some over the top, like the shaving incident)"
2,where is season 2???,alot of people have been waiting over a whole year for fox to release season 2 of m.i.m.i hope that when they release season 2(or even if they do) thatthey will realise that many people have been waiting and release some of the other seasons. i cant even say most of the words i want to because it would ruin my account.i just want fox to release season 2 on dvd so i can enjoy another season of m.i.m to watch.
5,"""Two thumps up""","I think Malcolm in the Middle is a good program. I have this first season, and I saw it almost everyday. For the people who likes Malcolm in the Middle this will be a good chance.Now. I think that Fox have to release Malcolm in the Middle second season, because there are costumers like me waiting for that."
4,Malcolm at the start ...,Superbe compilation de la première saison de Malcolm in the middle. Parfait pour toute la famille. A voir en boucle ! Dommage que les dvd soient zne 1 et pas zne 2 ou multizne. A ma connaissance Malcolm n'est pas disponible en Europe !!!? Dommage que les autres saisons ne soient pas éditées ...
5,Malcolm in the Middle - The Complete First Season,Why only the first season on dvd?This had juicey episodes but Malcolm's family last name is Wilkerson but I watched Bryan Cranston in TV Water cooler and he said the last name was something else a name I can't remember so now I'm confused what happened to the last name Wilkerson?
5,I WANT SEASON TWO,"This is by far the funniest sitcom on television. Ever since I bought Malcolm in the Middle Season 1 (in December 2002), I have checked amazon.com about once a week to see if and when season 2 would be released. I think it would make me and many other people very happy to have Fox release season 2.As for the first season, it is hilarious. My two favorite episodes was the one of the father doing choreographed roller skatng and the one where dewey and bea arthur did an interpretive dance to Fernando.this show has the best humor"
1,How did this get on DVD,I walk into Superstore looking at the new DVDs and what do I spot on the shelf Malcolm in the Middle. This show has never been funny and ever since it has been put on the air FOX would rather play it than a brilliant show like FUTURAMA. Now that it is on DVD I wonder why shows like Seinfeld aren't. It is ten times funnier and more witty and it has earned the respect of viewers nationwide for the past 12-13 years. I know I am ranting but it makes me mad that shows like this get praised so highly when shows that are so much better are shoved under the carpet.
5,Malcolm is just the funniest!,What student or adult couldn't relate to Malcolm and his family. It is a truly funny video.
5,Malcolm in the middle,"This is still one of my most favorite shows of all time. Such a great cast, they totally fit a crazy family, and it never got old."
5,For my 16 yr old son,He said this is a good quality dvd with good audio. Not much else he can say. He would recommend it.
5,The Best Show,I feel this is the best show on at this point. You don't see too many shows that is funny and creative show like this. There are some shows that try too hard to be funny and when that happens it just make themself look stupid. If you want to get a good laugh then buy this dvd. I'm really looking forward to Season Two.
5,LOL,My whole family has watched this season over and over again. It never fails to make us laugh and enjoy the aspects of family life. We are only disappointed with the fact that there are no more seasons out yet.
5,Its REALLY time now for the Malcolm in the Middle Season 2,"What do we have to do to get MIM second season released on DVD, please tell me and I'll do it ..."
5,A perfect gift for all the family.,"I'm from Spain and here we can't not find this compleate season from Malcom in the Middle, so is fantastic if we can buy thishere. We wait for the second season of this fantastic serie because is a very good one, good for the litle children and for adults too. This edition with audio coments and spanish subtitles is good for us who live in Spain, because we prefer the english original soundtrack instead the spanish one because is south american spanish not european one."
4,I would give it four stars but...,"... I think it's terrble that they havn't brought this dvd out in the UK. You would need a multi-region DVD player. I wrote to Frankie Muniz and he wrote back, say "" i know i think it's unfair, but theres nothing i can do to influense them to bring it out in the UK, sorry"" Frankie is a really nice guy i sugest you write to him sometime same with justin, but i've never wrote to him i just no someone that has. Frankie and Justin will answer to Mail, with full answers to what you asked them, and they will try they're best to help you if you need to know something about malcolm and that.I'm just disapointed that it's not out in the UK as well. PEOPLE IN BRITIAN LIKE MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE TOO!!!"
5,Best Pilot Ever?,"It is rare that a show's pilot episode is one of it's best. I started watching this show in season 2 or 3 and was hooked immediately. I bought this DVD in 2002 after having read an ""expert"" review of this being possibly the best Pilot ever made for a half hour sitcom. It did not disappoint at all. Like all shows there are a few episodes that are kind of boring but it always redeems itself. Much of this is the true american family with a little extra umph thrown in here and there. Great DVD, now only if they'd start cranking out some more seasons..."
4,One of the great family sitcoms,"(Rating is really 4.5 stars)Yet another amazingly skewed sitcom from the sad-ass Fox network, a la Arrested Development and Family Guy. Thank God these things get released on dvd so we don't have to watch Fux.One of the best moms ever on television, much closer to mom-home than the average american tv mother. This mom gets screaming mad and then loving smiley and then outraged again, all in ten seconds, just like a real mom. She's also hilarious.The kids are pretty real, the dad is occasionally brilliant, and the overall tone is rather realistic. As usual with stuff this decent, too good a show to last long.Don't show this to your kids under age twelve...they'll get ideas..."
5,"Season one is great, but where is season 2 and when can I buy it ??????","If you don't have this on dvd your missing some great laughs! This is quite an original series and quite fun to watch even for the 5th or 15th time! My question for FOX is this... WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE SEASON 2??????????? Dewey has been wandering the streets unattended for what.. 3 years now? It just isn't nice to leave us hanging for this long!!! Come on, release season two; I promise to buy it right away! For those of us in deep rural America without access to cable or even decent satalite reception, the dvd television series is a must! I'm starting to lose faith in the entire network for this obivous lapse in good judgement...release the second season already!!!"
5,Where's the 2nd coming of Malcom?,"We need the 2nd Season on DVD! This show is freaking hilarious, it deserves to be put on DVD for all of our viewing pleasure. I'm patiently waiting...for now."
2,Feels incomplete,This set needs all the other seasons to be released to DVD other wise it will be incomplete forever.I hate having to keep the tapes from TV the quality is bad and has a few edits made :SIf they all come out on DVD not only will the quality be better but it will also be a complete set :DPlease release it FOX pleeeease...
3,season 2 is????,"Fox need to release season 2 of malcolm in the middle, they will be losing out on alot of money and, fans.alot of malcolm fans are disappointed for it not being released, i don't know why it hasn't been released yet.people want it that bad that they are reduced to downloading it and getting it pirated to dvd, the same will probably be happening with season 3, 4, 5 ( i hope that im not giving anyone any ideas) so i just want fox to hurry up with season 2 and 3 if possible."
5,WOW!!!,"This is the first book I've read on the topic of EVP, and I was absolutely blown away!Although I've been an avid reader of all things in the ""metaphysical"" realm, I had actually never heard of the use of technology to communicate with the spirit realm - until I read this book.One day as I happened to be flipping through the channels, I caught a segment of a talk show where Tom Butler was discussing this techniqe and stated that he had just written a book on it. I immediately went to Amazon.com and ordered it. At first I thought that the book was a bit expensive - but after reading it, I must say that the information included is truely invaluable!The authors not only give examples of EVP, but they also provide detailed information to help other's get results via this method (as well as methods using a video camera & TV).This is an excellent read for anyone with an interest in the ""paranormal"" - an open mind is a must!"
4,great dvd,This series would only be better if it showed more of the group numbers but overall a great dvd.
4,Very interesting. Very informative.,"If you're looking historical proof that the Book of Mormon and the Mormon church is true or false, you won't find it here. However, if you are looking for some real, Biblical answers this book is a Great place to start!I thought some of his conclusions were a bit thin based on his references, but all and all it was very interesting and enlightening!"
2,weak unless you're interested in christian arguments,"this book, like many anti-anti-mormon books, ignores most of the truly troublesome anti-mormon arguments and instead focuses on different scriptural interpretations. so if you're an atheist or agnostic looking to understand the mormon side of things, this won't help because most responses boil down to: well, the bible has the same problem as the book of mormon. but if you're a christian wanting to debate the trinity, how heaven works, justification for modern revelations, the adam-god concept, etc., then this might prove useful."
2,Unbalanced,"To start off, the number one thing which puzzled and annoyed me, is why did the author portray Kais, tha main character, as almost immortal. He kills entire Imperial Guard armies, Space Marines,Chaos Marines and Deamons without as much as a scratch on his armor. In C.S. Goto's books, Space Marines were portrayed as they should be. Powerful, vigilant and able to take great amounts of enemy fire. Not get killed by a few pathetic tau pulse rifle shots. If the book had more balance to it, Kais would have met his bloody end on his very first encounter with the renowed Ultramarines. Just shameful how weak the Space Marines are in Spurrier's book. It didn't matter if Kais was possesed by a deamon or not. He should have been killed like his fellow Fire Warriors were.Under the overwhelming lasfire from the Imperial Guard,on his initial drop-off on the planet Dolumar."
4,Fire Warrior: Ending,"The ending of this book was not only confusing but rushed, after he killed the daemon lord or whatever, he had one arm, and he was crazy... But before he kills it, it shows in the book, how he realizes how his father wasn't perfect. but he is still crazy?"
1,Ridiculous......Horrible,"One complaint you will hear about Elvis is that at the end he was old, bloated and not the same he was twenty years earlier. I love Cheech and Chong, saw them in concert during the 70s and early 80s. I bought this DVD because their show sold out here in Houston twice. I was shocked they were doing the same skits they did back then and in the movie UP IN SMOKE. How the people found this funny I am amazed. The show was interrupted with stupid commentary and stupid subjects.I was very disappointed...You will laugh ten times more by watching UP IN SMOKE again."
1,sucks,this movie. i hate the hole movie it .sucks. its a rip off for the. im going to sell it back and i hope you like it back for the money and i need it back asap thank you Shanescape ...
1,Cheech & Chong's Hey Watch This,This item was a gift for a cheech & chong fan & he wasn't too impressed. Said it would have been better to have more of their actual concert shown rather than all the commentary in-between.
3,Ernest Fans Beware This Disc (but not the film),"""Ernest in the Army"" is not a classic Varney film like say ""Ernest Saves Christmas"", ""Ernest Goes to Jail"" or ""Ernest Goes to Camp"" but it is still a good film. Were plane and simple Ernest goes to the army, oh and makes friends with a young orphaned boy on the way. Film: 3.5/5The bad thing about it is the DVD flickers for 32 mins.(yes I counted) of the 86 min film. I was thinking it would be a small thing for maybe like 2 mins. From what ""Kevin Smith"" said in his but oh well. As he said it IS still watchable but for that part of time it looks like an old VHS tape from the 80's (which makes me glad I found it for $5 CAN)Picture: 1.5(at much of the time)/5 3(for the rest) /5Also the only bonus it a Jim Varney Bio so........Extras: 2/5Overall it is good But I still hope you remember my warning if you plan on buying ""Ernest in the Army"".Overall: 3.5/5Reviewed by S.R.Q."
2,Not up to par,"This Ernest movie will be a disappointment for those expecting more of Varney's comic genius. It is not on the same level of his earlier films. The plot is too wild, and the characters are too wooden. But it does contain some hilarious scenes. One involves Sticky, Sticky, Gummy Toads and a high ranking general. You can guess what happens. Overall, this film lacks the vintage Ernest most people expect."
4,Earnest is a hero again without even trying.,"This video offered some of Earnest's best comedy scenes both having to do with food. The interspersion of a t.v. news show host reporting on the progress of the army in which Earnest is enlisted made it more interesting. This is one of my family's favorites as we can laugh and not be insulted with language, violence, or inappropriate dress and relationships."
1,One more Ernest than we need.,Should have known better. The first Ernest was too much. Now this is how many redo's later? Glad I didn't pay for it.
2,POOR SCREENPLAY,"Varney is an amazing performer and certainly underrated.. Carrey by comparison is nowhere near as good a performer for example. However Varney cannot seem to find decent screenplays and directors. This is a pity. This movie is nowhere near ""Ernest goes to school"" and ""to Africa""."
4,Wonderful debut novel,"I actually met Craig Silvey in a local library today; Rhubarb is featured as the One Book to read as part of this year's Perth International Arts Festival. He was absolutely charming in person, unassuming, boyish, and totally overwhelmed by the success of his book. This book was a wonderful read, very honest and fascinating, with truly memorable characters -- even the peripheral characters stood out greatly. Since I live near Freo, it was great to have such a familiar setting; I could totally picture where the characters were. Very laudable debut, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next book from the author. :)"
3,Colorful but not great quality,"This rug is very bright, colorful, and cute but it is pretty flimsy. It is worth purchasing, given the price, if you don't intend to use it for a long time or in a high traffic area. Mine doesn't lie totally flat, FYI."
4,Wonderfully detailed historical novel,"Native Son is a wonderfully detailed novel from a historian more than skilled in the craft of writing fiction! Hochstetler weaves a rich, descriptive tale with characters that practically leap off the page. The second in a series preceded by ""Daughter of Liberty,"" readers join Jonathan Carleton and Elizabeth Howard in further adventures and spiritual growth as they fill their respective roles in the fight for freedom. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Elizabeth's spy missions for General Washington and the sons of Liberty, as well as Carleton's foray back into the Native American culture. As the fight for freedom escalates and the stakes continue to rise, readers will find themselves unable to stop turning the page. Looking forward to the next book in the series!"
2,Disappointed,Poorly done. Many of the routines were cut off at the end. No bang for the buck here. Save your money.
4,GREAT BASS,GEORGE IS (WAS) THE BEST TRUE BASS SINGER I HAVE EVER KNOWN. I HAVE PERSONALLY WORKED WITH HIM DURING SOME CONCERTS AND HIGHLY RESPECT HIS TALENT. MY FAVORITE ON THIS CD WAS # 18 WHICH FEATURED GEORGE (THANKS TO CALVARY).ONLY THING I WOULD HAVE LIKED BETTER WAS IF THIS HAD BEEN A STUDIO RECORDING INSTEAD OF A LIVE PERFORMANCE.CUT NUMBER 16 (JUST AN OLD SINNER SAVED BY GRACE) IS ALSO GOOD. THIS WAS WRITTEN FOR GEORGE SOME TIME AGO BY GLORIA GATHER AND DOES PRETTY MUCH TELL THE STORY OF GEORGE'S CONVERSION.I MISS THE CATHEDRALS AND THEIR CONCERTS.WALT KYZER
4,OTHER FACES OF THE THING,"Alan Dean Foster's adaptation of John Carpenter's The Thing stands on its own as a worthy fear-inducing read, guaranteed to rob you of at least a night's good sleep. The book has several extended scenes not shown in the film, including a chase across the Antarctic wilderness after a pair of ""thing-possessed"" sled dogs, as well as some variations (an axe murder/a bathroom stall suicide) on characters' deaths that differ from the film. The story still follows 12 scientists in Antarctica who run afoul of a monsterous alien being who has the ability to ""duplicate"" any one of them. As one by one, they're absorbed and slain, the gruff helicopter pilot MacReady takes command of the isolated camp and tries to fight back against the hidden enemy amongst them. If you enjoyed the film as much as I have...it's worth seeking out this book. Cuddle up to a warm fire, under a fog-shrouded night, and dare yourself to leave the lights out..."
4,great novelization for a great movie,"It's sad this book is out of print - it's a great novel that can stand alone without John Carpenter's movie as a great horror novel.An American team of scientists in the Anarctic stumbles upon the wrecked camp of a Norwegian team, unknowingly opening themselves up to an alien that can control and mimic its victims. Soon the team can't tell who is friend or foe.Foster has the perfect writing style for this novel. You never know who the alien has taken over until it's too late. I guessed originally who was who, and I was way off. I recommend this novel to any fan of the film or any fan of horror."
5,great companion for the movie!,Wonderful. keeps pace w/the book but adds extra info! I am a real critical person about books to movie. LOVED IT!! Excellent!
1,:( Bad Bad Bad,This case not for t-mobile SDA usa version.T-Mobile SDA (USA) not fit case is very small.Maybe for europe version.
1,Send it back to the grave,"I received my Autopsy Ghoul Mask just days before Halloween. Boy was I happy....until I tried it on. Mine is gigantic. I've got a good sized melon, and I was swimming in this thing! The label reads ""oversized masks"", that's an understatement. I don't see how it's possible to obtain the tight, defined look that the picture depicts. The label says to ""stuff newspaper in the top of the mask"" if it is too big. With my mask, you'd need the entire Sunday paper to make it fit, then you'd have a huge, out of proportion head...not the look I was going for."
1,Piece of Junk,"Do not waste your money on this thing. It could fit a very large pumpkin (it's ""oversized"") and looks very little like the photo, which was obviously of a prototype or movie prop. The mask isn't even the same color, it is a crappy gray color and warped and floppy rather than tight and defined as pictured. One eye socket is turned inwards so badly it can't be worn. I would send it back but the shipping cost and hassle aren't worth it. Shame on the seller for using such a misleading picture!!"
5,A Stunningly Beautiful Tarot Deck,"When I received this Tarot deck, I instantly fell in love with it! The artwork alone was enough to catch my eye, but much deeper than that, is the tone of the story they tell. I have been a practicing witch for 16 years, and this is the first Tarot deck that, from a religious aspect, is perfectly in sync with my practices. I highly recommend this deck to anyone who practices Traditional Witchcraft, Wicca or Druidry - in my opinion, it is a perfect match!Blessed Be!"
4,BIG cards but loads of information!,"This is a beautiful deck, truly gorgeous and, at times, poignant artwork. The accompanying book is very informative but abit hard to read as the spine is very stiff. The only real drawback is that the cards are just large enough to be awkward to handle."
5,Beautiful,"The cards are big, good quality, and not flimsy at all. The artwork is gorgeous, I cannot say enough good things about it. Just looking at the cards gave me a sense of familiarity I have not felt with any other tarot deck I have seen. The book is beautifully designed and put together well, with thorough explanations that are well-comprehended. DO NOT buy this anywhere else but amazon. The retail places will charge you double for it.This is incredible value for what you get. If you are thinking of buying this, you're making a good decision and you will be very happy with it.The only minor flaw I found, and it is so minor, is that the cards do not shuffle smoothly because they are big for my hands.I am now a fan of the author, and I look forward to reading more of his books."
5,VERY CLEAR,"I ENJOY USING THIS TAROT DECK AND SO DOES MY FUTURE HUSBAND. THIS IS HIS FIRST DECK AND HE FINDS IT VERY EASY TO FOLLOW. THE CARDS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE MEANINGS SEEM TO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THAN SEVERAL DECKS OUT THERE. I ALSO LIKED PAIRING THIS WITH THE ""POWER TAROT"" BOOK. THE DECK IS A LARGER DECK WHICH IS GREAT FOR LARGER HANDS AND FITS A MAN PERFECTLY!"
3,An Earthy RWS,"All in all, this deck and book set is well put together. It is based on the RWS (wow- there's a shock), but the earthy tones of the packaging and the cards lends nicely to the subject matter. I did find one or two hermetic mistakes in the book and went to the on-line forums about this and no one had any answers. That right there left me cold regarding this deck/book set. Still, nicely done and the technical aspects of the book, other than the mistakes, are top notch- a well written tome. Some of the cards are maybe just a tad hokey...comic-bookey. However, the Carr-Gomms and Will Worthington put a lot of work into this project and I'm sure it will resonate with the shaman/Druid/pagan/Wicca crowd...be alert to the mistakes, though. Also, keep in mind- Wicca and Druidism are in no way, shape, or form related to each other, even remotely. One is a relatively new neo-pagan ""religion"" and one is a sacred philosophy pre-dating written history."
4,celtic tradition tarot cards,"I like these cards and the book that comes with them, but the cards are very large and unweilding. The lessons at the front of the book is very informative. The prince and princess cards are a nice change in the minor arcana court cards."
4,Wonderful deck,"Love this deck for so many reasons. The art is wonderful, and they are printed on fairly heavy card stock. With the symbolism in the cards it leaves a lot for you to interpret also. There is only one draw back, the cards are huge (which is why this deck isn't rated a 4), so if you have teeny hands or like to shuffle pass this one up for your daily deck. These would make great pathworking, meditation, and spellwork cards. The deck should be a must have for anyone who collects decks."
4,Mostly Good,"Excellent pictures (both execution and choice of images), wonderful card stock for the cards themselves. The book is very informative and groups the cards interestingly by their rank rather than their suit.Just one problem. The cards are quite large, making shuffling somewhat difficult. This only lists the product dimensions (the box everything comes in), so it's not obvious that the cards are roughly 3.5 inches by 5.5 inches."
5,Hydroponics,This book is a wonderfully put togther all incompasing book on the subject of Hydroponics I tressure it.
3,As it says...,"It is a beginner's introduction to hydroponics. While it is an exceptionally good overview and a great place to begin studying the topic, it is by no means a canon on the topic. Grab this book, read it cover to cover, photocopy it's tables to tack to the wall in whatever area you do your plant working. It will give you a skeleton, but your flesh is earned via experience and communicating with other gardeners, especially in better hydroponics forums on the internet.These forums, however, can be confusing without the background provided by books such as this."
1,Read the wiki on hydponics and save some mone,The book is very dated and full of information you can get for free on the Internet. Save some money and seach google for hydroponics. On top of tha some of the pages are poorly scanned.
3,Very basic and more of a history book,I agree with many reviewers that this book is very basic and lacks much information on how to start your own system. I however did like the history portion.
1,Not what I ordered!,"I ordered Commitments with Michael Greene, but once I opened the package up, it was some other movie titled ""The Commitments""...this is not what I ordered!"
4,Cute,"I thought this movie was a cute romantic movie. I will admit I did cry a little bit, but I do that sometimes when I see a cutsie movies like that."
5,Like a breath of fresh air,"This movie does a fine job of contrasting the lifestyles of a city girl and a country boy. Like a breath of fresh air, the simple country lifestyle that the city girl eventually adopts, transforms her from an emotionally distant stock broker, into a loving person who finds value within herself. In the end she gets a real life and romantic love, something she never had in the big city. I am so happy that BET began making these movies."
2,Well...,"Just briefly:... I'm a huge Auger fan, but I'm not much on cheezy electronic sounds. This album would have been much much nicer if he'd been able to access a B3 for this gig, rather than alternating a rhodes and a Korg Poly800 - ouch! Well, I guess it was state of the art at the time, and B3's are hard to line up - you don't bring your own when you fly in for a quick gig in Germany. The Korg BX3 was a poor substitute, the 8-bit digital synths of 1985 were not really up to the quality demands of professional gigging. On the other hand, if your ears aren't tuned for rich analogue sound, the playing is technically unimpeachable, as you would expect. Just disappointing for a B3 junkie. I find I can't listen to it, except in brief doses, whereas I have just about every B3 outing of his career back to back on an MP3 cd I can listen to all day (cobbled from cd's I own - I believe in supporting artists I like, especially as my tastes are far off mainstream)."
5,Hasn't failed yet.,Good stapler. I've had it about a year almost & it hasn't failed me yet. It's perfect for tiny jobs.
1,Beware: No replacement staples available,"I have this staple gun and it works fine. The only problem is that the staples are now unavailable. I used to buy them at my local Lowes home improvement center, but they don't carry 1/4"" 6.3mm or 5/16"" 7.9mm staples anymore. Neither does Ace Hardware or Home Depot or amazon.com or any other place I have found. In fact, I have spent more time trying to find the staples than the gun is worth. I bought some 5/16"" 8mm staples thinking that .1mm won't make a difference. Wrong. They won't work. So, I've spent about $10 and several hours trying to get this staple gun working without success. It would've been a LOT easier and about as cheap just buying a new staple gun. Just be aware."
1,Frustrating. Not worth your time.,"I bought the staples that are listed on the front of the package for the TR45 (3/8"" 10mm) but when I opened up the package, the staples were just a bit too big and wouldn't fit - apparently you need 3/8"" 9.5mm (written on the staple gun). Stanley, shame on you for printing the wrong size on the packaging. Impossible to find 9.5mm staples so I'm returning this and getting a different staple gun."
4,It's a good light duty stapler,"I bought this to use at the rifle range to staple up targets, so I'm basically tacking paper to some really thick cardboard backstops. This stapler works perfectly well for that, and didn't cost much so I can't complain at all.I haven't tried to break it, but I've dropped it on concrete once without any issues, and it's been kicking around in my range bag for more than a year. It's as sturdy as I would expect it to be for the money.I bought a pack of Stanley 3/8"" light duty staples locally, and they work perfectly well. It seems that they are also available on Amazon:Stanley TRA206T 1,000 Units 3/8-Inch Light Duty Staples. I haven't had to go looking for more of them yet, but they seem to be available.The tool gets the job done, as far as I'm concerned."
1,Ridiculous waste of money,The staples that are included with the stapler are the WRONG SIZE! Unbelievable. Returning immediately. Come on. Take this thing off the market already.
2,Weak & Full of Advertising,"This was disappointing. This is what you see at the ""impulse buy"" section in the supermarket checkout lane next to the tabloids. Some of the info is interesting, but overall, a waste of money. I'm going to try the World Almanac, which may be what I'm looking for."

4,funny,this book was the funniest book in the series. the part with sebastino talking about how one should look was the best. the part with the dowager princess (grandmother)talking about how one should hold thier posture was great. it was really good and i suggest u read it. the only reason why i gave it 4 stars was because it kinda got a bit boring towards the end but then soon got better.
1,PC Princess Book - A Disappointment,"&#65279;PC princess a disappointmentMy wife pick up the book a school book fair as a gift for our daughter. The movie was great, however the book was a large disappointment. Instead of being a cute, tong in cheek book for girls, it morphed into a book dealing with such issues as whether to eat beef, leather shoes, and the wearing of furs being terrible. The book is a monument of PC in books for children."
3,A Bit Disappointing - Pick This One Up from the Library,"After reading loads of negative reviews for ""Princess Lessons,"" I decided to pick it up from the library instead of spending fifteen bucks on it. Well, it's definately a short read, and not too satisfactory.Mia, Grandmere, Lilly, Tina Hakim Baba, Michael, Paolo, Seabstiano, and Prince Phillippe all take part in this clever ""how to"" guide. Some topics covered are: How to aquire a boyfriend, how to dress like a princess, how to eat like a princess, and princess beauty tips. It's a funny book, but not long at all - it's about an hour read. Most of the comments in the book are written the funny - but stuffy - grandmere, and are snobby and useless. There aren't actually any good tips in the book, but it holds us over until Princess in Pink is released.Overall grade - C+"
4,GOOD cd!,"1. ""Greater Is He"" (5 out of 5..definitely one of my favorite songs off the album)2. ""Think About That"" (5 out of 5..beautiful to think on whatsoever things are lovely, are good report, are praiseworthy...""3. ""Somebody Loves You"" (4.5 out of 5..thank you JESUS for your love!)5. ""More"" (4.5..more of THEE and less of me Lord)6. ""Nothing Is Impossible"" (5 out of 5..my FAVORITE cut off the album! its such a pick-me-upper)7. ""OverJoyed"" (4 out of 5...the joy of the LORD)8. ""What Would I Do"" (5 out of 5..i love this ballad!)9. ""Superman""...this song is out of place (?) She's definitely not talking about JESUS10. ""In Christ Alone"" (4 out of 5)OVERALL, she has a nice voice and I'm glad i purchased this album (although 7 years after its initial release)"
2,"Album = OK, Dvd-audio version= terrible","I am commenting on both songs and the dvd audio release. As an album is not bad, is not maiden but still ok, would give it 4 stars. However as a dvd audio release its terrible, i was expecting more from this, a short interview, live footage, music video, something!!! It doesnt even have the lyrics, so what the hell is the point of a dvd audio release if it doesnt have any of this. Poor dvd audio release! Now i know why it was selling so cheap!See: Megadeth: Peace sells, thats what a dvd audio release should be"
2,Not one of his best...,"Bruce Dickinson boldly left Iron Maiden and released this second solo effort, going in another direction when comparing it with his solo debut, TATTOED MILLIONAIRE. The band supporting him is very good and, even if this project by itself does not please me, set Bruce in the path of great guitarist and producer Roy Z.I'm not against an artist adventuring into other realms, as long as the final result works. This album here simply don't work. It's kind of disjointed, bizarre, the listener will not be empolgated when listening to it. There are two or three moments, but most of the songs belongs to the delete bin."

1,Caveat emptor,"A few years ago, Kessinger provided valuable facsimile reprints of rare out-of-print titles.Today, to judge by the present volume, they are running their facsimiles through very faulty character-recognition software and reprinting them in hideous modern fonts and layouts overlaid with an enormous number of 'scribal' errors introduced by their computers.Such works are extremely unpleasant to handle and read and absolutely worthless for any scholarly purpose. They can neither be quoted nor cited. And while quality has plummeted, price has gone way up.I advise any potential reader to beware of Kessinger's reprints for any but the most casual uses."
5,I keep coming back...,"I keep thinking I can find something better for the price, but I keep coming back to this eye cream. I really like it and notice an improvement after a few days. It also lasts a long time."
3,Where's the beef?,"I love this series and have read them from the beginning. This one, however, was something of a disappointment. The first 7/8 of the book consists of build-up to what can only be described as the anticlimactic climax! When you have a thoroughly evil villain doing all sorts of unspeakable things throughout the last 2 books, one hopes for something more of a comeuppance than ""bang, he died.""The book is well written but, given that it's not Dostoevsky, could definitely have used more action and less plotline!"
3,Decent followup to Book 8,"LAZARUS RISING (12/2003) is the 9th book in the STARFIST series of 25th Century Military SciFi, covering the exploits of a galaxy-faring platoon of Space Marines.This book follows book 8 - KINGDOM'S FURY - which was, hands down, the best entry from the series... and a hard act to follow. The space aliens have been defeated on Kingdom, but in the power-vacuum left after the Confederation Marines leave, a NAZI-like regime pops up to take power. The NAZI types, of course, are a loathsome bunch, and their wicked methods are described in detail.The secondary sub-plot involves Gunnery Sgt. Bass's exploits (and his hokey ""amnesia"").As is common in this series, there is a dearth of future sci-fi technology (no new tech is introduced in this book), and no aliens or future cultures are introduced. All in all, this is an average entry for the series... but still fun stuff."
5,A Great addition to the series,Great read answers all the queries left from the last novelI had to finish it in one sitting .Next one please
1,JUST CLIPS,"I bought this video as a gift. i thought maybe there would be music videos maybe concerts. you pretty much have to catch a glimpse of either in here. its just talking and her lip singing to her songs. clips here, clips there. maybe 2 minutes or so. not like a documentary on tv. it doesnt even talk about her life growing up or career. It doesnt have anything to do with ""romans revenge"" except for the song list they play through out the dvd."
4,Normanwoofs,This Barbie is exactly what I was looking for to help tell the story of Barbie and diversity. She was in wonderful shape upon receipt and will be placed in my wedding case with other bridal Barbies. No doubt that she will be popular with our visitors.
5,TCM Unserstood,"TCM is misunderstood. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is 60 years old (Taylor, 2005). TCM aims to synthesise aspects of so-called traditional Chinese medical ideas and practices with scientific methodology. Chinese/western, TCM/WM, traditional/modern are thus false dichotomies and 'TCM is different to western medicine (whatever ""it"" is) and therefore misunderstood...yet in some cases supported by it' is not valid."
