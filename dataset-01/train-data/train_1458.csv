4,Lockout - Ratings?,"I rented this film from my local kiosk and enjoyed it very much.Before I buy the Blu-ray ""Unrated"" version, I would like to know what the difference is between the ""PG-13"" and ""Unrated"" versions.IMDb lists the running time of the ""PG-13"" version as 95 minutes, the same as the unrated being sold here on Amazon."
2,Video Game Physics - Plus Amazon Fail on Rated/Unrated,"2 Things.First, the movie's ridiculous video game physics during the initial motorcycle chase pretty much ruined the whole movie for me. My disbelief in how sucky movie special effects can be in 2012 was not suspended.Second, I noticed after I rented it there was an unrated version. I really think I should be either 1) alerted to the fact there is another version of the same movie I'm about to rent and be given a choice, or 2) allowed to preconfigure my desire to see the most raunchy, censor-needing version of anything. Guaranteed, if it is going to make someone feel awkward because it messes with their morality or limited world-view that's the version I want to see."
1,10 Tomatoes,"One of the worst movies ever made, don't waste your time watching this. Watch Blackhawk Down or The Matrix or another classic."
3,"Terrible dialoge, fun ""B"" movie","I was so hoping for a great sci-fi/action movie with Lock Out. Not so much.... The girl lead was ridiculous and worthless. All I kept thinking was ""if this was really happening, our hero would have just shot her at least three different times"" She was not worth saving, not worth his time at at any point. Now the good stuff - it had some laugh out loud moments (not sure if they were intentional or not, but funny all the same) and some of the action was well done. All in all, not one of the great sci-fi action movies I will watch again, but worthy of a rainy night inside."
4,"It was a pure entertainment ride, not the meaning of life.","I enjoyed the movie, which is more than I can say about Snow White and the Huntsman. Guy Pearce was hysterical, a total smartass thru out the movie. Don't take the movie too seriously and you will have a good time. I happen to like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Evolution, Runaway, and Army of Darkness too. If they appeal to you, so will Lockout. Everyone has an opinion, I happen to like action comedy."
4,good scfi action movie,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie because I've been really disappointed with most of the new scifi movies and TV shows. But I really enjoyed Lockout. Overall I think it had the a great balance of action, drama, and romance for a science fiction movie.My only complaint was about some of the scenes near the end of the movie which were annoyingly unrealistic."
3,Check your brain at the door,"If you expect snappy lines and lots of punching, shooting, and so forth, you will be fine. Don't expect Luc's best work."
3,Average BUT Enjoyable,"This is an action packed B movie. It moves fast and develops well. The story is well played. Its unfortunate that it had a small budget. You will like it if you are looking for bullets and a ""jail"" movie."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"The special effects were good, the concept of prisoners being lock-down in outer space, you would think they would had better security measures. Look at the security they have earth, way beyond security in this movie but again the screen writers did a half the job require if they even did that. Hell, I'm not screen writer but I would have had you holding onto your set and wondering WHATS COMING NEXT? You have such a big playing field that should be full surprises and instead your boring people, I figured it was a love story right in the beginning But I get it, its a mystery, gee couldn't figure that one out with the guy dying and given-en him his lighter, the suitcase misdirection was really stupid."
2,Nope,"Some people got together and said, ""Let us make a crap movie that will draw in the sci fi people, get their money, and dissapoint the hell out of them."" So it was done....."
3,Lockout,"Not the movie I thought it was, but I'll keep it and view it when I get tired of other DVD's I own."
4,Not bad....,"Guy Pearce held this movie together. As the hero, he is funny in a smartass sort of way. Damsel in distress is annoying. She loses her cuteness factor fairly early into the movie. Bad guys are fairly bad. Government guys are stereotypical. Some of the action scenes were pretty good.I watched it til the end and never felt like turning it off. So, I must have liked it."
3,Purist Science Fiction,"Action. Adventure. Exploration. No really weird twists or crazy-ass characters. Heros and villains...what's not to love? If you want to get what you are looking for and have it for sure, watch this."
3,Half notch above mediocre,The movie is OK at the best. Its play is primitive. Next day I forgot what this movie was about.
4,"Good script, well delivered lines","The movie is a must for action fans. Witty dialogue and interesting plot.The prison of the future is featured, and if it wasn't so expensive itwould be a good idea to store the crooks in space."
2,Spaceballs 3?,Wanted.to like.this.show.cause.i.was.in the mood.for.scifi. Poor cg could have.been overlooked.but the.cornball overthe.top writing staff really.brought this movie down. The main characters.were somewhat likable but the dialog was.just pathetic.
2,if you have nothing else to do,"not quite bad sci-fi, but not good either. a story told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. acting mediocre. effects OK. sorry i rented it."
3,"Cheezy, but entertaining","You know that it's cheezy going in, but can appreciate the concept of the movie and its entertaining moments. The picture quality was pretty good on my phone."
4,Good source to get started,"The book is a good reference source. The time line was very helpful when I was doing a research paper. I would like to see the definitions expanded a little, maybe include some general terms. Other then that the book is well organized and written."
2,What was WITH the ending?,"This book was written for people who want books to end with nothing, so that they can come up with their OWN ending. I really enjoyed the book, yet it had potholes along the way. And it was also too unbelievable. I mean, what kind of people would send a girl to a detention camp for teens for wearing a red AIDS ribbon? I will admit this book had me reading nonstop, yet when i reached the end, I just got MAD. There is no ending; they leave. Never look back. Where are the characters going? And what about Toms other two friends,Silas and Avery, what will happen to them? This was a sad, dissapointing book with little truth whatsoever. Unless there is a sequel, I'll never understand this book."
2,"Good idea, no motive","There are some very good things about this book. The characters are realistic, the plot is eerie, and the book is suspenseful. However, the plot of the novel becomes so outrageous that it begins to make it's own paranoid character seem lucid.The idea that there is a nationwide conspiracy is extreme. To make this strange plot device worse, the antagonists have no identifiable motive for putting all the teens into these ""concentration camps for teens."" The only identifiable reason why the teens are being taken away to these camps is that the antagonists are purely evil and need no reason to ruin the lives of the characters.I enjoyed this book but it lacked such important plot points that I wonder why it was permitted to be published as it was."
4,Very good story...didn't care for the end.,"I read this book in two days. I just couldn't put it down. I'd stop doing other stuff in class just so I could read After. I loved the storyline. There are many books out there that tell the story of schools where a shooting actually does happen, but this was a great change from those because you could see what precautions other schools began to take. However, the ending was bad. It left me hanging and I felt as if I had wasted my time reading the book to end with something as vague as it was. I recommend it, but I'm definitely hoping for a sequel to explain everything."
4,After,"I loved every minute of this book. The subject matter is so scary based on the fact that something like this could actually happen, and how easily it would be to accomplish something like this. The only thing that I would say I didn't like was the ending of the book. It seems as though it was left open for the possibility of a sequal, but I don't think it was. Now, if a sequal ever does come out, I'll be the first one there to buy it. Basically, this book is worth your time to read."
3,A book I hate to like...,"I LOVE the premise of this book. The idea of the school lock-down, the loss of freedoms, and kids getting sent to ""prison camps"". The writing left something to be desired. I've read better young adult fiction. I felt let down by how the story was written, It could have had so much more to it, and so much more ""meat"" to the story. There was an implied relationship between Tom and his dad, but Tom didn't trust his dad at all to talk to him. I couldn't understand this, especially when his dad would constantly ask him if he needed to talk. I continually got frustrated with this book. I had to put it down a few times. But persisted through it. I was unhappy with the end too. As a parent, I wouldn't just run away... Nor would I let my kids just be taken away, I would tend to them as I see fit."
2,it was wonderful...,"Until the end. I read this book extremely quickly, and was terribly disappointed by the ending. I was hoping for some big explanation of what had happened to everyone, it was definately necessary in this situation, but none was given. I give it 2 stars because all of it but the end was great."
4,After,"After is a great book from beginning to end!Its about the effect a school shooting has on students at a school for example Collinbine. It shows how the rules get alot stricter and how the school has to get a new student councel.The kids also have to take random drug test, this causes some students to lose friends."
4,Where's the end,"Although it was a great book up untill the 299th page, it just ends. I dont suggest you get into this book because there is not a good ending. good book, horrible ending."
3,Okay but little weird,"The book itself is really well written from the point of view of a normal kid and his family of the shootings and the school ""issues."" But I recomend this book to any who kind of likes teen type of books. There is lots of teen stuff and not very inapproiate stuff in the book"
4,Great Book!!!,"I've read this book two times it's great and it really did send chills up my spines everytime this book has the ""big brother is watching "" feel to it. but the ending was left with to many questions about what happen to Sillas, Avery, Tom, Tom's dad, Clara, Brian, Becca, and Becca's mom and dad. But all in all but this book is worth every penny"
2,"an okay ride, but not well thought out","The premise of this book - introducing the concept of an over-protective state becoming a police state to teenagers- is an interesting one. Teenagers in general are very isolationist, yet at the same time very aware of any inconveniences in their own lives. This book shows how those very traits are used against students to take over their lives.But the premise is not fully thought out. Without giving away spoilers, I can only say that I was very dissapointed in how the plot was resolved.There are some interesting observations through the book; some keys to the mindset of fascism. But overall, it's a thriller/horror with a weak foundation."
5,Definite Pageturner,"In short, this book pulls you in almost immediately, great for somebody who is looking for something to visualize easily"
1,Content matches title,"It seems a bit much to expect folks to lay out more cash for a new introduction and a few extra pages. But maybe Steve is right about people getting ""Dumth"". Amazon lists this book as ""list $10.95, our price $15.16"", and lists the authors name as ""Steve Dumbth and 81 Ways to Make Americans smart Allen ""."
2,Liberal Elitist Snob,"Although a little slow reading, Mr. Allen offers many good tips on how to improve your mind and your ability to reason. Unfortunately, some examples used to illustrate his rules were tarnished by his political bias. For instance, Mr. Allen refers to former president Ronald Reagan more than a dozen times, all of them negatively. These were unnecessary distractions from the theme of the book. He could have chosen other examples to explain his rules.It's too bad he has such a dislike for conservative potiticians like Mr. Reagan. If it weren't for President Reagan, Mr. Allen's grandchildren would probably be speaking russian.Overall, I was disappointed. His liberal political agenda and his snobbery got in the way of an otherwise useful book."
2,bad service is not dumb,"I love Steve Allen, but this book (like most of his) is pretty superficial and deals less with intelligence than bad service he's had to deal with. Sure, I like the coffee coming when I'm at a restaurant, but a slow refill is not a sign of low intellect."
1,lighten up Steve!,"I like Steve Allen and believed that perhaps through his comic view, he could suggest some fun and creative ways to be smarter and more efficient. Instead, his examples of dumbth seem more like an example of a bitter old man who hates repeating himself and prefers intellectual snobishness to human fallibilty. The book stinks. My advice to Steve.... Lighten up!"
1,rechargable flashlight,This is a pile of junk. The dealer tried to compensate for it but you cant make something good that is junk. It would work until the battery ran down and would never charge back up.
4,The continuation of an American treasure,"Forget the unfortunate choice of band name, this is really Bob Forrest's post-Thelonious Monster solo album. Forrest sticks to what he does best, which is to write unflinchingly personal songs and deliver them honestly and directly with no fancy flourishes to make them go down easier. The exception here is ""Song for a Kevin Spacey Movie"", which I believe was written (and rejected) for the American Beauty soundtrack, and it receives the big, echoey production that announces it as AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT ABOUT LIFE. Too bad, it woulda fit in perfectly in that arty rewrite of ""Hardbodies"" - but it's the sore thumb on an otherwise heartbreaking album."
4,Thank God for Bob Forrest,"May the Bicycle Thief's debut finally turn the world onto what has probably been one of Los Angeles' Best Kept Secrets - Bob Forrest.It's been a lot of fun to catch TMonster and the various Bob-related projects in intimate live settings over the years (since 1987, actually), but nothing would restore my faith in the existence of justice in this world more than to see others catch on, too..."
1,Please don't buy this!!!!!!!!!,"For the love of GOD, this is perhaps one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. The sound is like jackals gnawing at my brain. Bob Forrest and Bicycle Thief are criminals. They stole my $ for a horrible, horrible CD, and then they violated me through their ""music"". I will never be able to hear real music and not be scarred by the experience of having BOB scream about getting stoned and watching tv. I cannot implore you enough, do not purchase this album. It will only encourage BOB to further pervert the once noble art of music."
1,What is this?,I can only guess that some of the above reviews (the positive ones) were done by band members. There is no way on earth that this cd could have gotten such good reviews from an objective listener.
4,Excelente,"...Co-produced by A.N.I.M.A.L.'s frontman Andres Gimenez, it's a great record of a band that I like to consider as the best latin metal band out there today. It has great songs like ""Revolucion"", ""Usa toda tu fuerza"" and a great cover of AC/DC's ""highway to hell"". I didn't rated it 5 stars because I like A.N.I.M.A.L. 6 more."
5,Highly Readable Biography of a Fascinating Subject,AMERICAN CAESAR is a highly readable biography of a fascinating subject. Manchester has plenty of good material to examine from both the personal and professional aspects of MacArthur's life. MacArthur's genealogical background is also interesting since one of his ancestors is shared in common with both Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.MacArthur is portrayed as a brilliant innovator as exemplified by his masterful manuever in jumping from Hollandia to Leyte in World War II and of course the Inchon landing during the Korean War. The author by necessity tells the story of the U.S. Army's role in the Pacific during World War II mostly from the army's point of view. In that respect AMERICAN CAESAR serves as a useful adjunct to Samuel Eliot Morrison's HISTORY OF UNITED STATES NAVAL OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II.
5,Good insight.,"I have seen the MacArthur movie with Gregory Peck several times. In reading the book, you will notice several scenes from the movie. There is alot more of the personal side revealed in the book, especially concerning his family."
2,Dogmatic Worship,"This book begins with the dogmatic assertion that MacArthur was a genius, then through the first 14,000+ locations recites MacArthur's actions. When he does good, Manchester claims that he was a genius. when he does bad, Manchester claims that he was a genius. What prevented me from giving this a one star review was the fact that there is a lot of information here. A critical analysis of that information would have made this a very fine book. Manchester could only repeat his dogma. If you worship MacArthur as a god, you will probably love this book despite its ponderousness. If you are trying to evaluate MacArthur's leadership, you may find it useful but difficult.John BeyerleinLiz & Dick"
5,An in-depth study of MacArthur's life.,"I found this book to be a fascinating picture into the life and times of Douglass MacArthur. While Manchester does a splendid job of researching and examining the general's acts and personality, this book may prove a little vague concerning historical events outside the immediate area of the general. In other words, this book should be read by those very familiar with events in World War II, especially the Pacific Theatre, and the relief of MacArthur by Truman. Otherwise, many of the points made so successfully by Manchester may be lost on younger readers who didn't live through or have the generals exploits recounted innumerable times to them. Otherwise, this book is a very fine scholarly look and deserves to be read by any historian interested in MacArthur or the Pacific Theater of war."
3,Great book but Kindle edition has serious issues,"Manchester's definitive biography of MacArthur is excellent. Other reviewers have detailed its quality and balance. Like its subject, American Caesar is a 5-star book.However, the Kindle edition is very messy. Numerous typographical errors. Some were repetitive and annoying, others were real head-scratchers that took a little effort to decipher. I have purchased over a dozen Kindle books and found no comparable problems, but this was ridiculous. Amazon should be embarrassed to charge for the Kindle edition of this book."
3,Kindle edition,"I purchased this book in the Kindle edition. The book is wonderful, however, the proof-reading of the Kindle edition leaves much to be desired. This edition looks as though someone scanned the book, and then did not check the scan to see what came out. I am only halfway through the book and the errors are too numerous to count. Most times, MacArthur's comes out as MacArthur', in one place USA1 became USAi, CID (I think that is what was meant) came out as CLD, names have been clear in some places, and mangled in other places. If it wasn't for this bad proofing, I would give this book 5 stars. General MacArthur was a complicated person, and William Manchester has definately managed to show his many faces. If you can manage to ignore the proofing errors, I recommend it, however, if proofing errors will spoil your enjoyment, buy the paperback edition (hopefully not so full of mistakes)."
5,Manchester Clearly Defines the MacArthur Paradox,"William Manchester has written a informative and entertaining biography of Douglas MacArthur. Manchester clearly shows MacArthur as a modern day paradox. Manchester shows MacArthur's triumps and defeats. What I enjoyed about the book is how anyone reading this book as a MacAthur admirer would find plenty of material to back up their position, while clearly seeing why some people might feel differently. Conversly, for MacArthur detractors, there is a clear case as to why MacAthur was a bad general, but detractors are exposed to why many people think MacArthur was great. This is biography at its best. Balance and informative. Read this along with the novel the Emperors General and the non fiction Embracing Defeat."
3,older version,"The book was new, however it was older version.I was hoping for newer version, to use for teaching a class"
5,One of the best in dried foods,"Greetings,I found it excellent and useful for beginners and experts. Features.1. Book classified by type of food(fruit, vegetable and meat) then alphabetically sorted for each fruit or vegetable so easy to find without going to index.2. List down and descrip how to make it pretreatment and for which applicake and recommendation.3. In each item(fruit or vegetables), there are description about three drying process (dehydrator, sun or oven) temp, time, recommendation (pretreatment, flipping dried peices, movement of dry machine, ...etc)I didn't try the recipes for cooking stuff of each dried item(fruit and vegetable). It will be fantastic am sure.Bottomline, highly recommend for beginners."
5,Great little hand book,"This is a great book that is very easy to reference, is very practical, and overall easy to use. I grab it whenever I have something new to dehydrate, and I'm always happy with the results."
4,A helpfull book,"Being new to dehydrating,this book was very helpfull in how to use many of my dried foods"
4,Making & Using Dried Foods,This is a good book. It contains some information not in my other books on this subject. This author always does good work and is a pleasure to read.
5,A wonderful introduction to recent SF film,"Those films chosen by Kaveney inform the reader about which SF tropes she finds the most distinctive. They are tropes of gender, the postmodern and the post-human. And Kaveney carefully and with much delight tries to delineate the histories of these tropes as well.Simply a wonderful work."
2,Admirable Amature effort (possibly non-english author),"This book is a fine effort by an amature writer, i admire how he was so dedicated in completeing it. He doesn't seem to understand that he created carictitures though (he thinks his characters were realistic). Sometimes i feel embarassed for the writer (possibly uneducated?), but he has probably acheived his dream.There is little humor here, or insight, or plot or character development; however it is good to see that this man's dream has finally come to fruition. This is in no means a ""real"" book, but it is a fine grouping of many words. This shows that anybody can write a book, and get it published as long as it has considerable amount of content."
4,"Sharp as a Stick, Funny as a Monkey","Adam Cadre nailed the cynical teenage mindset in his first novel, providing readers with an overwhelming sense of familiarity, coupled with biting humour and a very involving plot.A touching novel; true to life (and large as life) characters add to the enjoyment. Pop culture fanatics will love it."
3,Be! Aggressive!,"I found the book somewhat aimless at times, and vaguely depressing at others -- it sometimes goes for long stretches with no moments of sincere human kindness or even mutual rspect, despite it's large cast. Regardless, at the end, I'm glad to have read it. The characters became so familiar that when Adam finally knocked down the pins he'd so carefully set up, I couldn't help but be affected."
4,"Review of Ready, Okay","I find this book to be very good. It held my interest from beginning to end. I could not wait to see what was going to happen next to all the characters.I did object, some, to the strong language occasionally used, and some of the sexual descriptions.I would recommend this book to anyone. This is a first book for this author and I hope there are more books coming. I look forward to reading them. Great First Book"
1,Weak Effort,"Might be an interesting combination of the great and inept, if only there was something great to recommend it. Adam Cadre's first effort is turgid and forced. The caricature style of writing is always in your face, like an annoying little child seeking attention. It demands the reader to recognize the cleverness behind the inside references (and ultimately the author). What really shines through behind the cultural smoke and mirrors, is a lack of intelligence."
2,1976 reprint,"If you have the 1976 edition, no need to buy this one. I thought with a 2005 publication date, it would be an update of the excellent 1976 edition, but no, just a reprint. Much has progressed in the museum field since the 1976 edition and it would have been nice to see that newer information presented."
3,Average,"There aren't a whole lot of animal loss books that are really great. This one is average in that it says things that every other book does, but in a way that doesn't make you feel silly for being upset. If this is the first you've had to deal with coping for the loss of a pet, this will be the best book you can read. If you've read other material, you could skip this one, most likely it'll just be a repeat."
4,Soothing.,"If you are reading this book, you've probably lost a pet. This is a good book about your loss and tips on how to look at that loss, how to accept the pain. Although I was crying most of the time when I read this book, the writer makes you feel better and yet walks you through the process of loss. You don't have to be religious. You don't have to believe in heaven and that your beloved pet will go there. It's more about accepting life and dealing with death, yet going on in your life. You feel you're stronger after reading this book. I liked it. No preaching. No hell and brimstone. Pets die, we cry, life goes on. A good book and I hope there's more like this out there."
5,Goodbye Friend,"I really enjoyed this book, Being i just lost my best friend! my dog after 14 years i needed something to read about to inspier me, i like the point Every thing dies Goldfish,Whales,Friends Family members, All life comes to a end!at some point! this book is very easy reading,to understand it all!Very good poems in this book! also {for every thing there is a season!"
5,To ease the pain,"I was looking for a book that would help me through the grieving process when I lost my dog to an unexpected illness. I got more than I bargained for. This book gave an open-minded multi-religious approach toward the treatment animals after death. This book also led me through the creation of a poem. I wrote a poem for my beautiful brown-eyed puppy girl Jaqi (pronounced ""Jackie""). I highly recommend this author and this book."
5,This is a great comfort,It is devastating to loose a loving pet and this book offers comforting words. I bought it for myself as well as my nephew.
5,Perfect. Exactly what my wife and I needed.,"When my wife and I lost our beloved cat, a friend gave us Rev. Kowalski's book. Now, we're buying copies to give to friends when they lose a treasured canine or feline family member. The book has compassion, heart, and gentleness. It's really perfect."
4,A Sweet Book,"I began reading books about pet loss just days after losing my beloved EmmyLee, a 14 year old mixed terrier.Some books seem clinical. This was rather sweet. I didn't get much from it till the last few chapters. It is possible that my frame of mind just wasn't in it, but towards the end, I couldn't put it down.It does help."
5,Never again,"I have lost many pets and each time it is as devastating as the first. Sometimes they just died and I didn't know why because they weren't even sick. This book helped a lot to get over the grief, but I got mad and wanted to find out what I could do to prevent the untimely demise of my current pets. I found great preventive care in Super Nutrition for Dogs n' Cats...probably the only book that gives you what to do to keep your animal from getting sick in the first place. Hopefully I will not lose anymore pets before their time."
5,after a loved pet dies,"I sent this and the other Kowalski book to my brother after his best friend, Smokey, died in his arms. He told me that it was helpful as he was grieving."
5,The press is good enough to warrant spare parts,"Chantal's garlic press is good enough that I bought spare parts. I highly recommend these -- especially if you don't peel the cloves first -- since the baskets deform over time. If you peel the cloves first, you probably only need these to replace lost parts."
5,Santana Enters The 80s In Style,"With ZEBOP!, Carlos Santana and his band entered the 80s in style. Santana is not only a soulful, masterful guitarist, but a wonderful human being who believes, rightly, that the young Australian tourist convicted in Indonesia in 2005 on a trumped-up drug-smuggling charge is innocent. The vocals, mostly by Alex Ligertwood, are superb as well. Anyone who loves Latin-flavored R&B-rock AND cares about others should own this one."
1,"OH COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK","ZEBOP! is a crazily compromised album. Where MARATHON represented an interesting interlude, the path that the Santana band would subsequently take was one of great commercial dividends with music that now sounds very dated.The driving percussion has almost disappeared from the Eighties version of this once-great band.Don't make the mistake of trying to find 'soulful' or 'passionate' Santana music from the albums MARATHON through to BEYOND APPEARANCES.These albums represent the shadow of Santana. Lots of Top Ten hits, studio sheen and nostalgia galore.It's no surprise that Santana rarely, if ever, plays the material from ZEBOP! or its surrounding albums in concert."
3,O.K.,It's okay not the best. there r better 1's. i think carlos did have a pretty album though and whoever put the song in the order they're in is good. so is it reccomended 2 u? Ya.g2g
2,Best songs are the instrumental,"A pop recording with decent guitar solos but average singing and average songwriting.The best songs are the 3 instrumentals.Listen before you buy.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
3,Better Santana Pop Album,"This is one of the better Santana pop age albums. The instrumentals are of high quality, while the other songs are hit and miss."
5,NOT Remastered!!,"This is Definitely my third favorite Santana album after ""Santana"" & ""Abraxas""The product description states that it's an Import and Remastered.The Artwork in the CD Clear Tray had been updated but it's the same exact disc I bought 15-16 years ago. Very unhappy that I now have 2 copies of the same disc with better artwork.Buyer Beware. Disc Info states 1983, Nowhere in the liner notes does this discindicate ""REMASTERING"" Same goes for SHANGO."
2,"regular boys, just regular boys","If the regular boy down the street is what you're after, this may be for you. It's true, these are young (read: 20-26-year-old) hairy (read: leaving as it grows what little body hair they may have) guys. But I look for some charge in a book of naked men and for me that means something to focus on. Call me a fascist, but I need something out of the ordinary, something ""ideal"" to catch my interest (and isn't photography all about a sort of interest in the things we see or want to look at again and again?) A few of these guys provided that for me (a couple are truly hairy or just look at the lens with an expression that suggests they're showing you something you shouldn't see), but most were just pleasant, young men without their clothes. A particular taste, I guess; just not mine."
5,Beautiful Briefcase,"The Italians have made a case you can be proud to own. The deep burgundy color and glossy finish make for an item that says ""class."""
2,Tubb for the purist,"If you like original 1940's quality music then this is for you.l Unfortunately the CD sounds like it was recorded in 1946. The selection is great, with Mr. Tubb's distinctive voice in the foreground. Unfortunately the background music is almost not there. The music sounds mono, flat, lifeless. Look for a re-mastered version."
2,Why Was He a Star,"I remember Tubb being as big as Williams, Snow, Frizzell, any of them. I hadn't heard him in years until I renewed my interest in country music and purchased this CD. I flat out don't know why I ever liked him? He has no voice. I mean don't buy this unless you hear something in Tubb's music that I don't perceive."
2,Very easily scratched,"I gotten this watch b/c of the mesh bracelet, very comfortable to wear, a nice looking casual watch, good brand. But I was disappointed that the silver rim around the watch was so easily scratched. I had the plastic clear sticker on the face of the watch for a week and just wore it that way since I figre no one can see it and it will help to protect the glass face. Well one week later the plastic came off by itself and within that one day of wearing the watch without the plastic sticker, the silver rim had some hair line scratches in one area. I was disappointed. I work in the office and don't do anything with my hands, I don't see how it could have gotten scratched so easily unless the scratch was already there beneath the plastic sticker. I'll see if any more scratches come about."
4,Best so far,"I purchased and returned two other Skagen watches because in order to get the larger watch face, I ended up with heavy, 'clunky' watches with large wrist bands that wrapped almost half again around my wrist when shortened to fit. This model is attractive, thin and light. The band is still cumbersome once shortened and the safety latch is tricky. The face of the watch is attractive but the numerals are small. Since it has the attractive mesh band, can be adjusted to fit and has a light, this face I will keep it. Now to see how it holds up."
5,Best Watch I've Ever Owned,"I got this watch at another store, but I've owned it for over 5 years now. It has to be the best watch I've ever owned, so much so that I paid to have the band and crystal replaced this past year since it needed the polishing. When it was returned from the Skagen repair center, it looked brand new. Totally worth the purchase."
1,3rd watch to break or leak moisture into crystal,"I love this watch and the mesh band is the best, but I've purchased three watches and all three had seals or stems which broke down to moisture. Some of these watches are supposed to be able to go into the shower and under water but I would never get another one for everyday use. I never take my watch off . I hope I can return them for credit or repair."
5,Does the job.,I bought this for nighttime sinus headaches but I used it one night for pain in my jaw because I was grinding my teeth in my sleep. Worked immediately. I have two. They will get good use.
1,Beware of second hand books,Unfortunately this second hand book arrived in a poor state with many missing pages. It was obviously unusable and unfit for purpose.
5,Great Example,"I found that this was a good example of Wing Chun techniques demonstrated on the wooden dummy. The form is demonstrated well and it is broken down into small enough chunks that it can be absorbed. Anyone who studies Wing Chun, as well as those outside the family, would find this to be a valuable resource in furthering their understanding of the art. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who studies our style or to those who simply want to know what it is that we do. I've studied the art for 28 years and I got something out of it."
1,Waste of money buy a collscan from nikon,"I have tens of thousands of slides to scan and I was hoping for the price that this would do the trick. Nothing but jams and mis alighns, Unfortunately when it jams you can not take off the cover to get the lide out withough removing the void if removed sticker. It is a shame. I even tried placing the slides in new holders and also purchased the slide mounts that offer different spacing and the carousol. It is too bad. now I have an $800 slide viewer. Now I use a nikon coolscan and I do one at a time but they are amazing. even when this machine didnt jam it would not scan them correctly."
5,just four songs...but they're beautiful,"I had just listened to four songs of Spailpin, but let me tell ya they are wonderful, at what they're are talikng anout...cool!This guy Spailpin sings so good, I hope I can know him.Dayra"
2,Cheap imitation,I was very unimpressed with this clock for a few reasons.1) the time area does not stay light even whhen plugged in which means you must push a button to see the time after dark.2) The led projection is very faint and unless the room is almost pitch black(which includes street lights) you cannot see it on the ceiling (which is only 4.5 feet away)3) the buttons are in a very strange sequence to use set/use the clock I wouldn't say it is very hard to use but different than other ones for sure
5,Very good product reagardless of poor reviews,"There are a lot of reviews here on Amazon that bash some of the properties of this product. A low level of laser light is one of the concern. However, if you are not taking frequent day naps, the laser brightness is more than enough for me. I would not imagine if I could sleep well during the night if the light level would be visible even during the day light.I did not have any difficulties with installation: just read the manual. Using buttons was very straightforward and natural for me - I did not have to read the manual for that. The set of features like two alarm settings, temperature reading and other make it a real bargain for the price."
2,Hard to see,"I wanted a projection clock and got this one as a gift from my husband. It does project well,but you can only see it if it is very dark in the room. The display itself cannot be seen from across the room as it does not stay illuminated. There is a certain time in the morning where it is not dark enough to see the projection and too dark to see the display if you look directly at the clock. During that time of day I have no idea what time it is!"
2,"Like the projection, but otherwise hate it","The projection is great. Otherwise, it is a bear to do anything with the extremely non-intuitive controls. Terrible on a Saturday morning when the alarm goes off at 6:15 and one is trying to turn the darn thing off."
2,Nice projection but outside temp never worked,The device is ok but the outside temp has never worked for me. I have gone through all of the troubleshooting instructions but still nothing. I was very disappointed but I have not seen anyone else complain about this problem so I may have just gotten a broken unit.
3,I Really Wanted to Like It...,"I own two La Crosse clocks with the weather features. One is a weather station and the other is Projection Alarm clock. I have owned them for about five years now but recently the projection had started flickering in and out and was becoming unreliable. So I went on Amazon to buy a new one. I was able to use the transmitter from the weather station to also work the new projection alarm clock so that was good. The reason I returned it was that the background light would come on for no reason during the night. The light was kind of bright, but the biggest issue was that it made a terribly annoying buzzing noise whenever it did light up. I could have lived with the buzzing if it only happened when I caused the background light to go on. But it actually would wake me up. So unfortunately I had to return it and I have reverted back to using my old one."
3,nice but with drawbacks,Very nice to see at night. Clearly displays on the ceiling but imposable to see during the day. You have to walk directly over to the clock to see the time. The normal display screen is very dull. If I had realized this I would have bought a different model.
4,Good night clock,"In the middle of the night, this clock works wonderfully. The clock does not add light to the room. The numbers are clear. the ceiling is 8 feet away and the numbers are 8"" tall and easy to read. Can't see the projections during the day. Also, don't let your two year old touch it. She will turn on both alarms (all it takes is pushing the front alarm buttons). Other than that, very happy, bought one for my mother for x-mas."
2,Outdoor temp stopped working,After a few months the outdoor temp stopped working. Replaced batteries in remote sensor (followed directions exactly). No luck. Disappointed. Time and indoor temp works fine.
2,Just OK,Not as user friendly as I expected. The time display is not backlit so you cannot see it from across the room. You have to look at the projection to see the time... kind of quirky to me.
3,Cheaply built but works fine,I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the case. A bezel around the display was off to one side but it was easily removed and replaced using the adhesive intended to hold it on. The projector section rotates but it wobbles and is only held on by the wires that feed it. It is of much lower quality (and cheaper) than the Oregon Scientific clock I was replacing but I really liked having both the time and outside temperature projected on the ceiling. I already had another La Crosse Technology clock with an outside temperature sensor and discovered that one outside sensor feeds both clocks. It quickly set itself to the correct time and date and was easy to set up.
4,"Nice clock, with a few shortcomings","I like the clock, and it works as I expected; however, there are a few things I find a little annoying:* The outside temperature doesn't always register. Sometimes it seems to give me the indoor temperature instead (not sure how this is possible), and sometimes it just doesn't register a reading at all. I've tried moving it around, but I'm limited in where I can put it outside, since the device is not waterproof (didn't realize that when I bought it).* When you press the light to see the display, the clock hums. The humming is only temporary, only as long as the light stays on (a few seconds). I wish there was a setting to have the backlighting stay on permanently. You can't read the clock in the daytime from any distance of more than a few feet.Overall, I like the clock. The red light keeps the room dark, but still allows me to see the time and sometimes the temperature."
4,Alarm clock,"Great alarm clock, although the outside forcast sometimes displays, and sometimes not.....even though the batteries are good, etc. Love the clock and seeing the forcast and time on the ceiling, very clear. Great, fast shiopping and service."
3,Too small!,"This item looks bigger on the website. I am returning it for a larger, Oregon unit. It also has no radio alarm function."
1,worse clock ever,"aside from the nifty weather prediction, this clock is completely impractical. The projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity. The clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible. I am surprise this is sold on Amazon. Thank goodness for Amazon's customer friendly returning policy. I think Amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good."
1,Disappointed....,"The display is very hard to read in the dark or daylight. The projection works but is also very difficult to get it on the wall and not every move the clock. The whole thing does not weigh hardly anything so everytime I would try to hit the button and miss it slide off or away. A stiff wind could blow it off my stand. The alarms are not very reliable or loud. The buttons are small, the unit as a whole feels more like a travel clock than a home clock with weather. The weather seemed to work well for a the first couple weeks until we got a cold week of standard Minnesota winter weather. Just not accurate at all. I guess I got what I paid for. the whole thing feels cheap and works like a cheap plastic toy."
2,would not recomend this item!,I found this clock to be too involved in setup for use. Could not see the display on the face at night. It stated that it would only adjust the time once a day and it took some time to get the time signal in my location. I also could not hear the alarm .. too soft for my hearing! I'm still looking for a simple one that I will be able to see and hear.
1,Major disappointment,"This clock is awful. It's cheaply made, randomly lights up (accompanied by a buzzing noise), and randomly turns the alarm on. I do not recommend this product."
1,No stars,We returned the clock because the intruructions were incomplete and poor. The clock did not perform the way we expected.
5,"Great Gift, Great Clock!","I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it is awesome. He would get so angry when I unplugged his clock so I got one that not would run off batteries if it accidentally got unplugged, but it would automatically be set. I love the projection onto the ceiling. There is no turning around to look at the shelved headboard or turning on the light. It is absolutely brilliant!!!"
1,Incorrect readings and looks cheap,"I opened the box and followed the instructions mentioned. Waited for 15 minutes but nothing happened. Had to set the time manually.The temparature reading format cannot be changed unless the time format is changed. If the time format is 12H mode, then the temparature shows in Deg F and if the time format is in 24H mode, the temperature shows in Deg C.As soon as I opened the box, I knew the quality is going to be bad. It has a very plastic feel, looks cheaper than the 1$ toys.The temperature reading (indoor & outdoor) even though both the units were kept besides each other. There was a difference of 1 Deg. Why does this happen, both the readings should have been the same. I doubt it will give the correct reading even if the wireless unit is installed outside."
1,Terrible. Do not buy this product.,"I would not buy this product. The projected image is so dim, that you have to have an absolutely pitch black dark room to see it. Additionally, the temperature readings were always 5 degrees off one way or another. I compared it using a mercury thermometer and this unit would show 5 degrees hotter during the day and 5 degrees cooler at night.My suggestion, get an oregon scientific unit. They are far superior and do not display the variable temperature inconsistencies.This is the product I bought instead and ts great.Oregon Scientific BAR623PA Atomic Projection Clock and Weather Station"
4,Good overview,"Short little book, but gives excellent overview of the different jobs in publishing. May be getting a bit out of date, since the industry is changing so fast."
5,Outstanding Listening Music,"I first heard Norrie Paramour's music in the mid-1950's. This double album is nothing but OUTSTANDING. You have to give the music your undivided attention. I am glad to see that ""Miss Anonymous"" is still a part of his music - a wonderful soprano she is. Patrica Clark is also equally as outstandidng on the ""Autumn"" portion of this CD. This music clearly depicts the tranquility of times gone by."
1,Useless,"Our old pressure cooker starts to leak after several years of use so we decided to find a replacement. This one seemed a good one for us, it's small, light and the look is not bad. So we bought this one but then it turned out a big mistake.First, it leaks. Water leaks and it's really a mess. We have to keep wiping out leaked water. Second, the pressure is just too light, it takes even longer than a regular cooker to make a steam rice. What a joke!We ended up throwing it away just after a couple of use. Last weekend wife grab one from a local store, works perfect. I'll never buy any product from this brand."
4,Survivor,"Thirteen-year-old Eric Kirby goes para-sailing above Jurassic Park with his friend Ben, with hopes of seeing real live dinosaurs. But after a minor accident where Ben dies he is trapped on the island... With no escape. It's just him and a dynasty of ferocious dinosaurs!This isn't a very good adult book, but children with an intrest in dinosaurs or Jurassic Park will love it."
1,No wonder it got canceled,I remebered Get A Life as being really funny. Boy was I mistaken. The first vol. left a lot to be desired. Save your money I wish I would have. In memory of Siskel I give it a big Thumbs (way) down.
5,Get A Life: The Anti-Sitcom,"Quite simply, Get a Life was is anti-sitcom in which all other sitcoms pale in comparison. I sold my blood so I could purchase both volumes of this great series (even though I had many episodes on tape). It was worth every drop. Volume One is good in that it starts with two shows of the first season. However, I tend to like the episodes in which Chris dies at the end (an aspect of the show that was later ripped off by the uninspired and pointless ""South Park"" -- I will watch Chirs get squashed by a boulder or blow up any time). Nevertheless, Volume One is a must for the Get a Life fan and anyone who is sick and tired of the cookie-cutter network comedies. Volume 2 is even better. My only disappointment is that there is no word on when Rhino is releasing Volume 3, 4, 5, etc. Wallet-Boy forever"
4,Certain sauces give me a rash.,"_Get a Life_ might just be my favorite show ever, but I'm not going to shell out for these discs with a mere 4 episodes.Issue a complete set, and I'll advance order it the second I hear about it.And while you're at it, include a commentary track for each episode by Chris Peterson and Gus Borden. Thanks."
5,My all-time favorite show!!,"I was thrilled to see that ""Get A Life"" was available on video. It was without a doubt the funniest television series I've ever seen. The 2 episodes on Volume 1 are classics. I feel they are a good representation of what the show had to offer. The scene when Chris poses ""shirtless"" in ""The Prettiest Week of My Life"" and the scene when Chris tries to counsel the teens in ""Bored Straight"" are hilarious! People who watch this series and come away saying it's stupid amuse me. You either get it, or you don't. I look forward to more volumes being released. My favorite episode was ""Zoo Animals on Wheels."""
5,There aren't enough stars that I can give to this show!!!!!!,"A hilarious show the the public just didn't get. For all of you out there who have a REAL sense of humor, and know what TRUE COMEDY is, BUY THESE VIDEOS! GET A LIFE is HILARIOUS!"
4,Finally on DVD....,"It took Rhino home video long enough to put ""Get a Life"" on DVD, But at last it's here. They managed to not improve the video quality by much, only fit four episodes on a DVD (I'm suprised the series lasted that long) that doesnt have any of the added features that DVD usually brings (commentary, multiple angles, French, etc.).I give the show all five stars for its perverse humor and total lack of a budget, But the less-than-overflowing DVD was a real let-down. I'd recomend this to any fan of the show, or anyone who's never seen the program before but is a big fan of over the top humor."
3,One Great Song,One great song: Gonzo. I could not afford the 45rpm when this record was out in about 1960 or 61 so it was worth the price for me to get this song (not on iTunes). But other songs nothing special.
3,It's too hard and poofy.,"When you are taking it down to feed it gets in the way b/c it is stiff and it's not very comfortable either. If you want a big padded bra then this is what you are looking for, but I was looking for a soft comfortable one."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this bra based on its good reviews. I bought it just a little over a month ago. It's true to size and I found it to be very comfortable. My problem with it is that it is ripping and fraying, just after a month of wearing it. I am very disappointed in the poor quality of the bra."
5,best nursing bra I've ever owned,I went to Victoria secret and had them measure me so I knew my size. Then I ordered this bra. It gives good support so you look nice and opens easily for it's job. The cups have retained their shape over time as well. Better than the bras I bought at Motherhood and JC Penny in the past.
4,Great nursing bra,I wish I had found these 14 months ago when my son was born! This bra is comfortable and supportive. I especially like the inner sling to keep everything in place! I gave it 4 stars because I wish it was a bit more padded so my nipples didn't show through. I will just wear nursing pads to help with this.
3,Small for size,"I am a definite 36 dd. This bra is sized a bit smaller than that. I had read other review that said that but figured mine would work. I can barely hook the last row of hooks and its tight. The cups are closer to the right size, but there's no 'give' in the material that nursing moms need. I kept the 2 I bought for later on when I'm not nursing as often and the 'sisters' aren't quite as huge ;) I would go up atleast in the band size when ordering. I do like the bra as a whole, just wish it would fit!! :) ps good for you for nursing!!! Keep up the good work:)"
2,"Returned this bra, very unattractive and horrible fit",This bra is a very poorly-made and ill-fitting bra. The underwire and lining are crooked and clearly very cheap. It is quite uncomfortable. The sizing is also completely off! I ordered a 36D and it felt more like a 36-38F!! It does not feel supportive. Don't be reeled in by the price. Its cheap and you get what you pay for! I returned this bra immediately.
2,Sizing very incorrect,"I don't know who sizes these products but the cup size is too big by at least 2. I ordered the 36D, and it was massively too big even for the 2 days when my milk came in that I was very engorged. It's useless. Order small and return it if you need to."
1,not great!!!!,I bought this bra and when I got it washed and dryed it as the directions stated. When I put it on immediately the wire popped out and stabbed me. I am not happy with this bra and I plan to contact Leadin Lady. The sad thing is besides the wire coming out it fits really well. To Bad.
3,Not For The Faint of Heart,"An excellent reference work for the devotee of paleontology. Should be read with your biology/botany/geology reference books in hand. Definitely a research work and at times, too scientific. Lacked continuity in some chapters (not surprising since the geological record is hazy at best) and could've been enhanced by chapter and overall summaries in layman's terms. If one's looking for an read along the lines of ""Discovery Channel's"" Age of the Dinosaurs, this is not the book to purchase. Well written, yes; as a good read, fair."
1,Just a note,"This guy isn't a sniper, he's a medium machine gunner (look at the weapon). The phrase is nice, but don't get caught up in 'sniper' mystique."
3,rocker switch,"not what i thought it was but it stiil pretty great,didnt do what i wanted that about all i can say about it,could ben better with bigger wire would be better,still pretty good though"
4,Good Replacement switch,"Old switch gave out. It is for the winch on my ATV. I use it to plow my very long driveway in Missouri, and it has held up well. Plugged right in where the old switch was before. Was much less expensive than ordering from the local discount auto parts store. bracket that connects switch to handle bars is good and solid and keeps the switch in place. This one functions well."
1,1 way rocker,"Rocker switch once installed only worked 1 way and that was up. When I took out my meter I found it would close going up but showed no continuity going down. Something wrong with switch. I took it apart to try to fix it, I found it must be internal and I could not fix it. But at that point, it was too late to send back because the whole unit was in pieces and could not be fixed. Out it went in the trash."
4,Works great but had to modify the terminal ends to blade connections,Works great but round wire connections did not match the solenoid. Had to cut off then crimp in female blade connectors to plug on to the solenoid. DO NOT wire directly between battery and winch. Must use a solenoid system. No rubber cover on rocker switch but looks good. Easy to use with gloves.
2,Try again...,Looked to be a good idea at the time...came in a brown envelope with no instructions or labels to indicate which wires were for what
1,not worth the price,"I usually buy cheaper brand of brushes for all my painting jobs. This time, I need to paint some very nice and expensive Anderson windows with wooden trim, so I figure to get this expensive brush to get a better result. I am very disappointed. After a few minutes of use, the bristles starts to stick to 3 bunches and the result is not as smooth as other brushes I had, very cakey. Save your money to get other brands of brushes just work as well."
3,Cordless phone/radio Rating,I really like the design of the phone/radio. It works well in a small space on the night stand. I like that it has 2 alarms. If I could just get the alarms to work all would be great!
2,"Great idea, but poor execution","This is one of the very few cordless phone/clock radio combos out there with dual alarms. That said, my wife has had a love/hate relationship with the thing since we got it. Most of the love goes (went?) to the 900 MHz phone, which worked great until the warranty expired. Most of the hate goes to the clock radio, which is not intuitive to set, has an alarm that plays for 10 minutes and then shuts off (heavy sleepers will snooze through this easily), and is generally lacking in features. And as I mentioned, now that the one year warranty has expired, the handset is having frequent problems connecting to the base. So we're in the market for a new unit - but this one had so much potential..."
2,GH3062 Leaves a lot to desire,"Even though it's one of few dual alarm clocks with cordless phone, the design is pretty weak. The snooze button is at a bad location and you could easily shut the alarm off when intending to hit snooze. It's not the easiest to program and the phone feels rather cheap."
2,Good combo unit but low end phone,We had been looking for a clock radio/telephone combo unit for a while with the aim of saving space on the nightstand. This phones footprint is very compact and the clock radio portion works great. Only complaint is the phone is very basic with respect to features and low quality with respect to performance. Largest issue is it is difficult to hear a conversation.
3,Good value,Over-all convenient with cordless phone and clock radio. Phone Battery has gone dead however. Try and find one. Amazon description does not even give battery replacement number.
2,Features versus Quality,"My experience with this product is similar to other reviews here. The beeping---which occurs at times for no obvious reason---is incredibly annoying. But my major complaint is that the rechargeable battery has never kept a charge for very long, which means the handset needs to be in the cradle charging all the time. I've gotten 3 good years out of Uniden Ni-MH batteries but the SW Bell Ni-MH proved unable to hold a charge after a few months. Worse, I'm having trouble finding a replacement battery. At around $12 for such batteries I wonder if the unit is ""totaled."""
3,Picture As Shown Inaccurate Depiction of Product,"The picture of the product is misleading:1) The MaxiView Mirror is much larger than the one shown in the picture. It actually obscures a quarter of the area of the side view mirror. The dimensions are 2.5"" x 2"" (these dimensions have been omitted from the product description).2) Contrary to the manufacturer's claim, the convex nature of the mirror actually causes quite a bit of distortion, which takes a little getting used to."
1,THE TRUTH,"I bought a medium size of Maxi View. The truth is this mirror block part of my view. I can see so much better from my SUV mirrors. Objects actually so much closer than its appearance on the Maxi View. Even though you can spot the object in the mirror, it is so tiny that you can easily overlook. This is danagerous!"
2,Excellent but stingy.,"The music is exquisite, but there is only about half an hour of it, and there are no liner notes."
5,Pure romance!,"I live in Greece. Although Chavela Vargas is from Mexico (at least that's what I think), her voice is perfect for a warm Mediterranean night, gazing at the reflections of the moon on the sea-water, surrounded by ""flor de azalea"" and whispering ""adoro"" to your lover..."
5,"Grounding, Lyrical, and Changes My Day","I bought this book in the middle of a crisis, needing to better apply Taoist principles to my daily life.I am continually surprised and thrilled at how freakin' USEFUL and clear this little book is.It has helped me be useful and centered.Don't miss its stupendous, concise introduction:""365 Tao encourages you to explore on your own. That's where true experience lies.""""Tao fundamentally assumes that an inner cultivation of character can lead to an outer resonance.""It truly is, as it claims, ""a book written for people who are trying to live the Taoist life today."""
5,Centering Messages,"I have had this book for a long time now. I just pulled it off the shelf again recently. This is not the first time I have read it. This book is worth more than a once over. For each day's meditation, there is one word, followed by the Chinese character. There is a short poetic verse at the top, which is followed by the meditation of the Taoist principle of the day. Each time I read the meditation, I find a different perspective. Everything always comes out fresh and new. The messages help to keep me focussed and centered. The book is the prefect size for a purse, brief case, or bag. I carry mine around. Even though I have my beloved Kindle, I prefer to actually hold this book and feel each page as I read."
2,there are much better book choices,"I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I had high hopes for it, perhaps too high admittedly, and upon reading it, I found it uninspiring, vague and not particularly helpful in furthering my understanding of Taoism.Skip this one. Read ""the Tao of Pooh"" instead. It'll change your life."
1,Pure crap,"This guy is a classic joke. He should be on SNL.I am a Taoist and I am ashamed of what he is writing.With all due respect, I think the ""Master"" has fallenand hit his head on the curb."
3,365 Tao,"I've owned this book previously, wonderful meditational.However, the copy I received from this seller had a completely different cover and I'm still in the process of ascertaining whether or not it is indeed the same text."
4,Masterful and well written,"I picked this up right after reading the Tao of pooh and was very impressed. The book is very well organized and he stays on a subject for several entries in a row but has the skills to switch to another subject before he beats it to death. I do think that he had some misplaced ideas, like you having to be in certian places or in certian seasons to feel the Tao. I think that the Tao is everywhere and timless. Well worth a read but Deng may be a little too strict and monastic for some readers."
5,A must-buy!,"I've only read the first 49 so far (about 1/7th the total) and I'm blown away. My original thought was to read one at a time, reflect on it and then move on. I do that but all are so good I keep reading. The format makes it easy to read a little here and there and each page is both accessible and profound. Just buy it."
5,an excellent introduction to taoist thought,"I have read this book so often since I first purchased it four years ago, it has simply worn out. This book is an excellent primer to Taoist philosophy. When you first purchase the book, avoid the temptation to read it all at once (like I did). Instead, take a year and digest it. I still feel that this book is one of the most grounded and pragmatic sources I have ever encountered, and I am on my fifth time through. Enjoy!"
5,Brings a calm spot,"This is a very useful book for meditation and for contemplation. Read one meditation a day, or go at what is comfortable, but no matter how fast or slow, it help focus and still your mind."
4,My first book on Tao,"This book so far has not given me anty ""WOW Moments"", but the short stories are a fast read. I am going to look at other Tao books before I read this one again."
5,Awesome!,"Very entertaining and awesome testimony of a person lost in drugs, and fame, who comes to know Jesus Christ, and see how his life is transformed. The video shows how great a skater Hosoi was/is and who he help shape skateboarding to what it is today.Highly recommend it to anyone who loves skateboarding or is interested in learning how skateboarding became the sensation it is today."
3,Ecclesiasts 1.. allllllll over it,"Didnt really care for the cussing and other stuff that was in it..After and During this film i wanted to go out and shred the pools with my skate board...... but there is one problem..... ""I CANT SKATE"" this movie shows how they felt SEX, DRUGS, and MONEY is the meaning of lifelater on in the film AFter VERT DIES in early 90s.. falls into drugs . in early 2000s is arrested and placed in prison..he seeks for ansewers to his Questions??? ""Why am i here in prision""??? and later Cries out to GOD...and TRULY FINDS LIFE...read Ecclesiasts 1... type it in your searchengine...seeek truth....."
3,"The rise, fall, and resurrection of a legend","There is another excellent documentary about a fallen 80's skate legend---""Gator--The Rise and Fall of Mark Rogowski"", or something like that. Both guys were brilliant skaters, innovators of modern skateboarding. Unfortunately, both of them made a lot of money as teenagers, and neither had strong family units to keep them sane. Rogowski ended up getting into drugs and committing the rape and murder of a young woman. He's in prison for life. Hosoi got into drugs and went to prison, found God, and is now working his way back. Tony Hawk, on the other hand, had a strong family unit(his father Frank Hawk, in particular), and we all know how he turned out. It's really pretty sad. Christian Hosoi was more popular than Tony Hawk at his peak, but his drug use and immaturity kept him down. Now, everybody knows who Tony Hawk is---but only skaters know Hosoi. Good movie, but it manages to be depressing and uplifting at the same time."
4,Useful short guide to formatting,"Other reviews here that attack this book for not being a good design guide are missing the point. This book is a set of practices to make your code easier to read and work better in groups. Each chapter is about some kind of convention (formatting conventions, documentation conventions, etc.). You're not going to learn to program with this guide; you're going to learn to make your programs more usable in a group environment. Yes, it is a pamphlet-sized book: that's the point."
4,Good code standard resource to start with,"Several years have passed since this book was first published. Many things have changed in the Java world since then.However, it looks like development at a corporate level of a software product without adherence to some sort of development and code standards is disappearing. This book contains a very good set of rules and code standards one can start with.Not that it is important to follow exactly some specific already existing guideline but it is rather vital to have one and keep going with this set of standards. The book suggests a wide range of various well described code standards so that a Development team might build their own set of rules using the book as an example.I would like to recommend any Development team to have this small but helpful book in their library."
2,Not enough,"I'm very disappointed at the amount content in this Book. Sun posted a Java style guide that was essentially the equivalent, but free. Equivalent in terms of topics covered while there were some noticable difference such as variable naming.One of the redeming qualities of the book though is that it can serve as a coding standard thus saving one from tidious chore of deciding on your own standards. In the end does it really make that much of a difference as long as everyone on your team is following the same standard?Best part of the book is the title."
3,Good start - Needs a 2nd edition,"This book provides a strong basis for establishing the always needed coding standards on every project. But, just as with the classic Elements of Style, it needs an updated edition. One major note that should be addressed is the recommendation on double-checked locking - the fact that this flat out does not work in Java has been well-documented and published on multiple occasions. I look forward to the 2nd edition!"
5,"Kewl best practices, not just punctuation rules","In addition to all the usual rules about proper capitalization, indentation, comment styles and such, there are actually 42 pages on good Java design and coding practices (defining subclasses that can be used wherever their superclass can be used, always constructing objects in a valid state, exceptions, assertions, really good rules for synchronization, lazy instantiation, etc.) There is also a very short chapter on packaging. There's a lot of forehead-slappers in this very portable book."
1,"bad, very bad","it's only recommended for the most begginer of the begginers, in general programing not only in java.Very bad for me and, i think, everybody that has already written and seen any code in any language.Wasted money.example:this is not rightif (something) {do one thingdo another thing}this is rightif (something) {....do one thing....do another thing....}i guess, everybody knows this."
5,All the right elements,"This book came along at the right time for me. It has all the right ingedients for standardising team coding styles and developemnt methods, including simple descriptions for their use. I recommend it to those in a similar situation or those who are looking to standardise their coding approach and create best practice standards. The real plus factor is that the book is small enough to read in a day, yet useful for a life time!"
3,Made in China,"I purchased this garlic press keeping my fingers crossed hoping it was not made in China. Nope, it's made in China. I haven't used it because I plan to return it so I can't comment on how it functions. It looks fine, but if I'm going to be forced to buy a high priced item made in China, I'm going to try the Kuhn Rikon(also made in China) since users rated its garlic pressing ability above average."
5,Excellent Sandal,"Dr Martens are great. I ordered this one to replace the pair I had for 10 years and they are even MORE comfortable. My first pair still looks new, except the footbed finally came unglued from the sandal. So I had to replace them. This pair is even better quality. Extremely comfortable. The only shoe I will buy online with out trying on. Just make sure you know the right size to order if you're not from the UK."
5,"Good quality, no lame cartoon designs","I bought these for our 2.5 year old daughter. Good price, high quality, and you get 6 in a pack. The cotton is soft and they hold up well in the wash (the waistband doesn't fall apart like some other brands of underwear). They're also nice and simple - no annoying cartoons emblazoned on them, which I appreciate."
5,My Favorite!,"Don't start reading this book late at night. I have shared it with many of my friends and when they start at night, they don't get any sleep."
4,On My honor,"This was the best book I ever read.It was very exiting for me to read.I loved that book,and I would prefor to read. It would be a good book report."
2,A poor choice,The gold mesh band lost some of its finish and the safety catch became tarnished after wearing only 3 times. Had to return it for full refund.
3,skagen,The transaction was smooth and returning the watch was relatevily smooth too.The watch on the other hand was not of the quality I have always experience with skagen products. The closing latch was bent. I found that very unusual for the durable materials that I have seen in those watches in the past.
5,Skagen women's ss watch,"I love this watch. It will fit any wrist as it's band is adjustable. Very easy to adjust also. It is hypoallergenic, which I have to have, due to nickel allergies. The face of the watch is a beautiful mother of pearl, which has a beautiful sheen which looks different in different light. It goes with everything as it is subtle in design. It is also very easy to read, which is important for those needing reading glasses."
5,Beautiful Watch,"I love Sakagen watches!! This one is beautiful, functional, and a great price.What more could you ask for?"
3,"Again, nice looking watch, but not what I expected","Take two for a skagen with a bigger face. Similar review to my previous skagen watch review.......- Cute and nice looking watch, but not what I was expecting.Yes I did see and read the specifications before deciding to purchase ! Thought the face of the watch would be bigger than it is. Prefer a bigger face as it is easier for me to read, so a little disappointed as I now need to find another watch more suited to my needs. Will make a nice gift for someone. The watch is dainty and petite, and not at all cheap looking. Shame it isnt for me. Would buy this brand again, maybe check out the mens styles instead !Note to self : So after this time I really do need to check out the mens skagens"
4,Good for the price,"I like this product. It does exactly what I want it to do. The only complaint I have is that it is really slow to get the pepper out. If there is a way to make it come out faster, I haven't found it. It is fantastic for lightly peppering dishes, but when you want a substantial amount for a recipe, it takes a bit of time."
5,great all in one grinder shaker,"Spent ages looking for an all in one pepper and salt shaker. First bought a Dansk one from crate and barrel, but the pepper compartment was tiny, so returned that.Very pleased with the operation of this one. Like that you can see through, so you know when you are low, and it grinds and shakes well. Have had it a few months and no problems."
2,plastic parts broke,I liked the style of this unit but the plastic threads the cap screws onto are thin and cracked. Also the shaker is tall and thin so knocks over easily - making cracking the plastic thread likely. My unit did not last a year. And I also had to widen the salt holes so salt crystals could get out this century.
2,looks nice but spills easily,This combination pepper grinder/salt shaker looks great in my contemporary kitchen. It grinds the pepper well but the lid that screws onto the salt part was not well-designed. The threads need to be longer or something. I have accidentally knocked it over a number of times and the lid falls off the salt part and then I have a big mess to clean up! If you buy this you may want to make sure the lid is secure before filling up the salt part entirely.
4,A fun addition to my western collection of books and music,I love watching all of the old Roy Rogers and Dale Evans movies. The music and movies compliment each other.
2,"Great music, but...","Poor, though tolerable recording quality, but my worst complaint is the absence of liner notes--not even song credits. The CD is subtitled ""featuring Roy Rogers"", so we can assume that some of the songs were recorded pre-1938, since Roy Rogers left the Pioneers in 1937. I don't think it's safe to assume that Roy participates in all of the songs and we don't know on which songs Roy sings nor when he sang them. For a historic CD, this is very, very poor--how much effort would it take to copy the recording info in the liner notes? Tumbling Tumbleweeds is definitely not the original 1934 version, because I have the original and this isn't it. The original can be heard on the Country Music Hall Of Fame series and is much better than this re-recording--slower, more stirring tempo. Also the recordings are clean and the liner notes are good."
3,Early days of western music's greatest performing group.,"Roy Rogers' great voice really stands out in ""I'm an old Cowhand."" ""Blue Prairie"" is always haunting. ""Along the Santa Fe Trail"" may be amongst the awfullest songs ever recorded. All in all a good purchase and a great buy, particularly for those interested in the early days of a national treasure still performing after nearly 65 years."
5,I used to think all paint brushes were the same,"I used to think all paint brushes were the same; then I tried a Purdy brush. The amount of control you have with a quality brush is amazing. After a while, I could do without masking tape and could cut in trim by hand."
4,I'm singing louder,"In a word, AMAZING! I was blown away by all the music on this CD. Only disappoint to me was Audio Adrenaline's rendition of ""It is Well with my Soul"" but not because it was a bad rendition. I have their album Underdog, and they do a duet with Jennifer Knapp on that one. That sounds a lot better. I loved to hear K Max performing with Sonic Flood... excellent vocals. The real treat for me was to hear Luna Halo. I'm glad to see that some people from the band Reality Check coming out and forming a band. Their debut is excellent. A must have if you like worship music and you march to a different drummer in terms of music."
3,Horrible Kindle edition of Great Book,"Machiavelli gets 5 stars and this Kindle edition gets 1 star for an average of 3 stars. The Kindle edition doesn't have a clickable table of contents. So get this book, but not this Kindle edition."
2,Not a painter paint brush,"The build quality feels great when you hold this in you hand. That is until you start painting. Not good for cutting a strait line. While the brush is supposed to be soft, the bristles are actually pretty firm. The softness comes from the length of the bristles which cause the brush to ""flip"" if too much preasure is applied. Perhaps the biggest problem is the brush is too thin and contributes to the sense of having a ""lack of control"". I've had Purdy brushes in the past that I have loved (painted professionally for years) but the last two I've purchased have not worked for my skill level (cutting in straight lines without tape). I am going to try to cut the brush down a 1/4 inch to see if that helps. If you a looking for a good 3 inch brush for cutting lines I still use my old but reliable Benjemin Moore brush. I don't work for any of these companies just trying to give a heads up on what used to be the ""best"" brush in the business."
2,Yellow Wall Pops don't stick!!,"I recently bought blue, red, green, orange and yellow wall pops stripes. They were so easy to hang and they look great, except the yellow stripe, in 4 different places int eh room, will NOT stick to the wall, I followed the instructions perfectly and all of the other colors are not having an issue. Suggestions? Very weird if you ask me. Other than that, the idea is perfect and the rest look amazing!"
3,Big hair and big cartoons,"I admit it, I watched JEM back in its heyday (or perhaps even a little afterward as my memories of it are the reruns on USA). It was the glitz, glam and excess of the 80s wrapped up into a glamorous hot pink package that makes an army of Barbie dolls look mudane and typical in comparision. Jem was like Rock Star Barbie, and the episodes for this series generally revolved around concerts, fashion, making music videos and hot sports cars, and of course the Vixen crossed with Taylor Dayne, dance inducing electric edged pop rock music that went along with it.She-Ra provided little girls of the 80s with a strong female heroine to look up to for their fantasy otherworldly fix, while JEM provided the ""I wanna be a rock star"" fantasy rolled up into made for tv animation. It wasn't brilliance but it was definitely a nice fix for weekday afternoons. Want to relive the nostalgia? Well here you go."
5,JEM VOL 2,"Great entertainment for the whole family. It's about a holographic rock group and how they get themselves into crazy adventures. Little girls will love this. It's the 80's ""Spice Girls."""
5,Keep these videos coming!,"I love these cartoons! They are a terrific mix of music, great stories, and out and out fun. This video contains the episodes ""In Stitches"" and ""Culture Clash"". In the first episode Jem and the Holograms travel to Venice for Shana to compete in a rock fashion contest. There Shana has to deal with her insecurities, as well as the Misfits, who'll do anything to come out on top. In the second, the girls go to New York to shoot their new video with an avant-garde artist. They soon realise that his art doesn't mesh with their idea of this video, then they are ensnared in a jewel smuggling ring to boot. Let's hope Rhino releases some more of these great cartoons soon, because there are lots of Jem episodes that people haven't had a chance to see in years. Besides that, we have a whole new generation who is just learning who Jem is."
1,Why the three girls on the cover?,"This is one of those books where the author couldn't care less about lesbians, but the publisher realizes that girls-loving-girls sells, so they put three nude women intertwined together on the cover despite the fact that there are very FEW lesbian scenes in this book! I CALL THAT FALSE ADVERTISING! I was very disappointed as a result! It's an illustrated book largely filled with drawings of guys with their genitalia hanging out. Not erotic or even interesting. Why can't they be honest and make that clear on their cover picture? Answer: Because they want to sell to gullible people like myself.THE COVER PICTURE IS THE BEST PART OF THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Manilow Music & Passion does not disappoint,"I saw this concert on PBS, and ordered it immediately as part of my donation in support of public television. It was wonderful, and moving, and I loved it! I have several of Barry's other concerts on DVD and tape, and I am proud to add this to my collection. Definitely worth the price asked for on Amazon. I am a true fan-a-low;it would be very hard for Barry to disappoint me. Music & Passion does not disappoint!"
5,SupercalifragilisticexpiBARRYdoceous!,"I have the DTS version, but the music is the same. This is one of my 3 favorite Barry DVDs, this is a great one to have. It includes an absolutely GREAT compilation of songs. It also includes Barry playing the accordion and playing Flight of the Bumblebee on a kazoo! This is just too cool. Add that to his wit and charm, as he chit chats with the audience in between, and musical talent and this video is just superb.There is also a tribute to Frank Sinatra. The DVD includes the upbeat version of ""Could It Be Magic."" As beautiful as the slow melodic version of that song is, the upbeat version is too cool. I don't know which version I love best.The DVD is done in such a way that you feel like you have a front row seat. The Nashville crowd loves Barry and he gives another 120%.Barry looks great in this one and puts on a super fantastic show, AGAIN!!! You won't be disappointed if you grab this one up."
5,"An excellent concert,with manilow putting on a super show.A must have for Manilow fans.","This concert is great.PBS,has again out did themselves.A really good show,with a lot of flair and energy.Barry still can deliver the goods.The sound and video is superb.My hat goes off to the engineers,bravo I highly recommend this dvd and again ,Thank You PBS!!!!From Stewart L."
2,Ultimate Disappointment,"I agree with the previous reviewer who recommended ""Manilow Live"" or ""Ultimate Manilow"" instead of this. I was totally prepared to love this recording...but it comes off as forced and lifeless. Manilow live is usually a remarkable experience, so I can't figure out why that didn't come through on this."
2,PBS ruined this one.,"I love Barry, have been a fan of his since Mandy came out...but PBS must have had too much to do with this one. The music was as if it had been over dubbed and the camera angles were bad. It was very difficult to watch for someone who has seen him perform in Vegas. He is an excellent performer and this just didn't seem like one of his productions. I couldn't believe how bad the sound was. It was such a disappointment and I have a hard time believing that Barry signed off on this one. Spend your money on Manilow Live or Ultimate Manilow...they don't disappoint."
2,The Manilow magic was not there.,"I was ready to buy this dvd, but after viewing the PBS special,I decided not to. The Manilow magic was not there. I don't know if it was just the tough schedule he was keeping in Las Vegas or something else? He just didn't have that rapport, with the audience, that always comes through in his other performances.You are better off buying, Manilow Live or The Ultimate Manilow both dvds are infused with that, ""Manilow Magic."""
1,BUYER BEWARE,Will NOT WORK ON XBOX 360 HD DVD. I could not get access to the menu. You only see the first 1 min. of the FBI warning and that's it.
1,boring.......,"this guy hasn't come out with any new material in 20 years or so,so why not buy his earlier concerts,than watching this aging geezer try to recapture what he kind of had in the 70's?? for fans only....Doesn't he look pretty on the cover though?(sarcasm).....HO-HUM!!"
3,Not too great at cutting in,"I bought this brush (2.5"" XL Dale) at a local paint store, and I have not found it well-suited to my needs. The main problem is that it doesn't flow paint out to the tip very well. For example, if you're cutting in the wall along window casing or other trim, the bristles might actually be sliding along the edge of the trim (and leaving traces of paint on the trim), but leaving the paint on the wall an eighth or sixteenth inch away--and this is when the brush is full. Also, because of the thin handle style, this brush does not hold much paint.Another small gripe I have is that the ferrule has sharp square corners that are uncomfortable to hold.Overall, Purdy is probably the best brand of brushes I have used. It could be that this one I bought was not constructed correctly--and individual defect rather than a bad design.But I wish I had bought a Nylox 100% nylon for fine cutting in and ease of cleanup."
2,brushes,I could not tell for sure from the picture the size of the handle. The handle is to thin . What i need is a full size handle.
2,"Not so ""Holistic"" than the title says","I order this book right after I bought another holistic pregnancy book ""The Natural Pregnancy Book"" by Aviva Jill Romm (I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is seriously intersted in natural and holistic pregnancy). Unlike Romm's ""natural"" approach to the pregnancy, this book seems a little too preachy and less ""holistic"" and ""natural"" than I expected. It has too much of the ""official outlines"" from the traditional medical practices and rather than encouraging and celebrating prengancy, they overemphasize on the threat of miscarriage and do not provide enough information for preventing it. It gives a general overview of holistic treatment and what goes on during pregnancy, so I think this is an okay book for those who just heard of ""holistic treatment"" but don't know what they really are. I was dissapointed overall and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is looking into a good natural/holistic pregnancy book."
1,"I'm sure they had good intentions, but...","When I found this title at my local bookstore, I was excited by the concept of it, but I didn't have to flip through it for long before I was taken aback by the negative tone and lack of trust in the process of pregnancy and childbirth. (Much like the overrated ""What to Expect..."" series, unfortunately!)I found a number of sections that felt, to me, like slight, strange misrepresentations of the facts and norms, andThen I stumbled upon an entire paragraph that had no place in any book written by people with any interest in truth or accuracy: In their description of norms in the 3rd stage of labor(delivery of placenta), in the home setting, they write that your homebirth midwife will reach up into your uterus to ""remove any remaining placental tissue.""This is not true. In fact, it is a horrifying idea.I sincerely hope that they will correct this frightening, misleading, erroneous section in any later editions of the book."
4,Pretty and functional,"I love glass items and owned a glass teapot for many years. On a recent move across country, my original teapot was broken so I searched for a replacement that would match the glass mugs and saucers from the original set. This teapot almost matches my old one, but is a bit smaller, which is something I didn't realize in reading the description. I would have preferred a larger pot, but this one makes 2-3 mugs of great tea. I really like it and am happy with my purchase."
4,I love this,"The only reason I give this four rather than five stars is it drips. However, I can count on one hand (and have several fingers left over) the number of tea pots I've used that don't drip.Perfect size for two cups. Nice to look at, and perfect for the ""blooming"" teas. When I read previous reviews, several mentioned that it was susceptible to breakage. Then I realized those reviews seemed to be from men. I took a chance and ordered it. This is not fragile. It is glass. Normal care will prevent breakage. This is beautiful, functional and reasonably durable. I highly recommend it."
3,Wouldnt buy it again,It really is too small . I bought this for my husband. He does like the idea he can put the whole pot in the microwave!
3,Good pot and cover,"This is a very pretty teapot. The only concern that I have is the glass infuser... the holes in this are simply corner slits around the bottom of a small glass cup. If you look closely at the slits, you can see the glass fractures around the edges. This worries me that the glass will crack with temperature changes, or worse - small fractures of glass will end up in the tea... so I will not be using the infuser."
3,Beautiful but fragile,I have bought a couple of these for gifts. both are gone now as they don't seem to hold up to the rigors of daily use. perhaps best for special occasion only.
3,GLASS TEA POT,A very pretty pot for using with flowering teas......but this one is smaller than I expected....should have bought a bigger one.
3,good and bad,"the entire body is glass, which is good.the filter gets jammed with loose leaves and its crevices are tiny, so it gets very difficult to clean."
5,Her Highland Rogue: Fantastic Read,Ms. Burroughs characters capture your heart from beginning to end. Her writing is pure and emotional. Reading this book made Scotland come alive for me. This book is a keeper on my shelf. I look forward to many more books by this wonderful author.
5,A Truly Great Read!,"I loved Highland Rogue as much as I loved Leanne Burroughs' first book, Highland Wishes. Highland Rogue is filled with adventure, emotion, and love. Ms. Burroughs writes with heart--definitely an autobuy author!"
5,Super second book,"I bought the first book, Highland Wishes, when I saw the video trailer on Youtube and loved it so much I went ahead and bought this book, the sequal. And I am even more impressed. Ms. Burroughs continued the tale of Scotland putting her love of the country into the tale. She shows a strong growth in style, making me care about the characters.I cannot wait for her next book."
2,The Complete Bobby Rydell on Capital,"While I like the music and the vocals performed by Bobby Rydell,if I had I had known that songs contained on this CD were not his hit songs I most likely would not have purchased this CD"
2,Yuk!,"If someone only now discovers the music of the talented Robert Ridarelli and wants to buy this item as a ""theme"" album where he shows his talents, go for it, but in hie heyday, we did not care about anything but the hits and there are damn few here."
1,Author is not an expert,"After reading the product description, I was very interested in finding an objective expert outside of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons. With all due respect to Ms. Hutchinson, she is unfortunately not an expert on the religion, nor is she objective. Her research is often anecdotal and surface level."
2,"Judge, Jury, and Executioner","This is far and away one of the best anti-Mormon books I've read. That said, it isn't all that good. Ms. Hutchinson simply does not seriously engage Latter-day Saint arguments. She presents a very weak and uninformed version of the Mormon position, and then beats her straw man to a pulp, proclaiming herself the victor. I can't see how that would be very satisfying, and I certainly can't see how it would be very helpful to those whose primary goal is to understand rather than to score cheap points. Again, there are far worse books on the market, but that isn't much of a recommendation."
1,Author has no clue whatsoever,Janis Hutchinson has no clue as to what a Mormon Missionaries motivations are. This book is a waste. Don't bother reading it
1,Ex-Mormon is Right,"This is a typical piece of literature authored by someone who became disheartened by the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Having served a mission for this Church (not `church'), I recognize that her supposed `psychological research' into the psyche of Mormon missionaries is based on her own frustrations and shortcomings. The bottom line is if anyone is to know exactly what the Mormon missionaries preach then they should seek them out and listen. Reading a book about the supposed secret teachings and meanings of a `cult church' is ridiculous; go to the source of the information (missionaries) then ask the Supreme Source of Truth (God) if the doctrines these young men and women teach are true. An anti-Mormon book will not inform or clarify; such a book will only confuse, disorient and make a sensible, good Christian into a judgmental heathen."
1,the mormon missionaries an inside look at their real message,"This author sounds informed but she is not; her calling mormons a cult has gone out of fashion long ago. I presume she has a phd or some sort of degree and she relishes using her advantage over lesser trained people. She does not like Mormons for what ever reason and it is evident in her book. She lacks tolerance for anybody that may disagree with her. Mormon Missionaries are usually young males between the age of 19 and 25, and they pay their own way for 2 years to help the world find its way. They preach tolerance and love, something this author lacks.If she were up to date she would know that many antimormons do call mormons a cult any longer, only those who are woefully ignorant still refer to mormons as a cult, this author demostrates her ignoanorance."
4,work watch,"My last analog/digital watch was a joke it kept falling off the band. I thought i lost it severasl times. I finally look for another Analog/Digital watch, found it and love it. I will only buy this type of watches."
5,Excellent overview,"This book provides a general overview and synthesis of various topics in Highland folklore. The book covers ideas on witchcraft, death omens, second sight, the pagan survivals in festivals, etc. Each chapter brings together tales from other sources, the author's own experiences, and some discussion of related topics.While the book is short, it provides a synthesis not found in mere collections of superstitions and folk-practices, and Dr Ross brings to the work her expertise in the study of pre-Christian Britain and Scotland. The analysis helps to provide a great deal of depth that might otherwise be missing.Highly recommended."
4,"Engrossing, but what makes it hip hop?","This was a good story, although a bit violent for my taste. The author really made the ""reality"" of the ""thug life"" jump from the pages. She got right into the story line and still alowed for a strong bit of description so that you could see and feel the streets. I loved the Maceo character and his enlightenment of his own coming of age. As a forty-something mother of an aspiring rapper, I just don't see what makes this hip-hop!"
4,Love this book,This book is a fast reader and then the follow up is just as good. This one is a hip hop suspense that keeps you wanting to know more. I felt that the characters were well written. Good reading. Don't forget to read the Last King too.
5,An all nighter,"Nichelle you're a great writer. I was pulled into the Okland scene and didnt want to leave until I knew who killed Billy. The characters were so close to home. As a writer myself and one of your Strivers Row line mates, I'd like to think I know a good story when I read one. Well this is (sho nuff) one. Keep up the good work. Travis Hunter"
4,This book is a page turner. Worth every penny!,"I must say that after reading the insert that I thought I was going to be reading another street saga with a typical simple storyline and plot but boy was I wrong. This book held my attention and even had me anticipating chapter after chapter. I actually finished it in two days.The characters had depth and going into the backgrounds of their past relationships with each other really helped to enrich the story for a better understanding throughout.The language was right on point because I have a cousin out in Marin City right outside of Oakland and all I hear out of his mouth is ""Is that Right?"" then ""Right. Right""The story was well written for it to be the writer's first novel. I never been to Oakland but the writer put me right on the street corner to see it. I will definitely be on the look out for her next novel."
5,Fast Paced and Real,"Tramble's first venture into writing novels was very successful. In The Dying Ground she uses great charactariztion to let the readers understand her characters. Maceo, a former athletic star, is slowly drawn into the world of the Oakland drug trade when one of his best friends, Billy, is murdered, and his girlfriend, Maceo's unattainble love, disappears. Following various leads with the help of his Holly and friends, he is sucked deeper into the mystery. The writing is fast paced, complex and interesting, with believable characters. The end slowly ties up loose ends, though it keeps you guessing for it doesn't conclude in a way most would expect. I thought it was a really great book, and I'm looking forward to reading the sequel."
1,not good,"I had to return this one. The picture looks much nicer, but the actual bracelet looks very dull. It is too tight."
1,not like the picture,"When I ordered this I was really excited to get it because the picture is so beautful. when I got it I was really disapointed, the translusent delicate quality it has in the picture is an illution, it looks chunky and ugly in real life"
4,"31"" Paddy Cream Bear",Shipping was very quick and not very expenives compares to most sellers for this item. Had no problems very soft my girlfriend likes it a lot.
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book because I didn't really see a lot of homes of ""Unsurpassed Grandeur"". Of the 181 plans, 138 are less than 5,000 square feet. 10 are under 3,000. Only 6 are over 7,000. Maybe 75% have the master bedroom on the first floor, which seems to be the style but I really don't like. Most of these plans are just standard plans with one or two changes to make them a little nicer. Also, a few of the plans looked like they had been photocopied too many times and had blurry lines. A few of the plans were printed so small that you could not read the room dimensions. Overall, I was not satisfied with this book. Maybe I just have different ideas of what an estate home is and what unsurpassed grandeur looks like."
1,Gross Gross,"I ordered a pair of tan large swim trunks for my husband. They arrived in a plastic baggie stapled shut. I opened it up, pulled the shorts out and noticed something. It was full of BUGS!! they appeared to all be dead. But gross gross. The bag was full of dead bugs, the shorts had dead bugs and spots on it. What's worse is that we are going on vacation next week and we will have to scramble to get him something, because these are going back to amazon.I don't know who's error this is. amazon or the manufacturers. plus, they refunded the $16.00 I paid for the shorts, but not the money I spent to return them."
1,The worst programming book I have ever read,"I am a professional software engineer who was looking for specifics on CE development. In the course of my career I have read Stroustrup, Design Patterns, Algorithm books, you name it. I have never, ever, seen a book this awful. Dr. (!) Krell preaches about the ""subtleties"" of pocket pc interface design. Patronizes about the importance of being a user in order to understand UI's. He constantly refers back to his little, custom developed GUI framework whenever he discusses building UI's for CE, but doesn't make it clear when the function is in the Windows API or his little framework. He generalizes in a chapter about just what good software architecture means. His steps are laborious and often humourous (""Step 1. Launch embedded Visual C++"").If you wish to waste money buy this book. I would give it a 0, but that's sadly not an option."
2,Some sections have merit,"You should be aware that, in general, this book is NOT a very good book (it puts too much emphasis on the use of the author's individual programming quirks and applications). However, the sections on setting up a program so that you can build it for both the Desktop and the PockectPC environments have merit. But, as I recall, the implementation makes use of some kind of libraries found on the CD that comes with the book. Also, the implementation is for a C++ based programming environment, not a C#/CompactFramework environment - but the general approach should be the same. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Compact_Framework/"
3,Bored To Tears,"This is not my first book from Tanya Anne Crosby, but I thought the book to lack feeling (always jumps from subject before you could emphasize enough), the characters weren't formed so well (especially when the hero's `I love you Elizabet, marry me! Hahahah.) Didn't think it came at the right time. The plot was shallow, editing needs work and I found some of the words laughable. Though it had humor, which made the book bearable to its end. I finished the book in one seating and got up feeling it was not entirely a waste of my money or the author's best work. But if your choosey at picking Romance books I wouldn't suggest it, but if feel for the risk be my guest. 1 star- for being written, 2 star- for being published, 3 star for finishing it. I think it deserves a three star."
3,predictable.,"your standard formula romance story, but well written. I enjoyed it, but not something I would buy again or reread"
3,"Rough start, easy finish.","A little tough to start but a wonderful finish. I pushed myself some to keep reading at first, nutrients story picked up and took off."
3,Not the greatest,This was far from being the greatest book in the series. It was ok though. I felt the previous books had a bit more depth and feeling than this one did. The book was still worth reading though.
4,A favorite of my Grandson,"My grandson really likes the Berenstain Bears. I bought another dvd before, and his mom said he liked the show. Though there are some episodes on that one I feel are for older children after watching it, he started liking the bears. I bought the newer version later on, which was more kid appropriate. This was the version I've always liked anyway. Everytime he visits, he wants to see this show. The smile on his face is worth it alone. He will sit and watch all the shows if you let him. Then later on, he will ask to see it again.It is really a cute cartoon, and the dvd shows great. It has continuous playing as well. The previews are a nice addition. He likes to watch those as well. There are six episodes to watch. This show can be costly, so I do shop around. I will buy more dvd's."
3,Flush Valve Seal,"Flush Valve Seal is a fancy name for an expensive toilet washer. Although this price was better than you can get in the store, at the end of the day, it's still an overpriced washer. If the water in you toilet keeps running, you need it."
3,"Very nice LCD TV if you don't need closed captions, (response)",Based on your review / comments about lack of CC (which I also discovered when I tried to use CC with HDMI) I returned my Samsung and got a SONY KLVS40A10. It has the same issue and the only way to get CC is via my cable provider's Cable box. Seems odd that. I like the SONY and find it of better quality picture wise then the SAMSUNG but who knows - I may be imagining!Can anyone else use their CC with a HD LCD?
2,Passable fiction set in 20th century USA.,"I found the book to be a very quick read - ""popcorn"" fiction, if you will. The authors seemed prone to preaching about a number of things, including the character's brand of Wicca, which read to me as if hers were the only form. The traitor in the group is obvious to anyone who reads on a regular basis. All in all, a rather bland attempt, with some humorous scenes scattered around. I find myself hoping there isn't a third book."
2,Ugh! so far,"I have to admit that I'm only halfway through the book and I shouldn't write a review until I'm done, but it better get better quick. Is it just me or does it read like a bunch of product placements? Diet Coke, Wal-Mart, Keds ad nauseam. I realize the authors are trying to show our world, but it doesn't come off right. Hopefully the story gets better after the first 150 pages. I'll write another review when I've finished the book, but right now, it's not doing anything for me."
3,Good but not great.,"After REALLY enjoying ""Glenraven"" for its tightly woven story, great characters, and humor, I was excited at the prospect of reading ""In the Rift."" I was disappointed that the sequel was not as good as the first book. Where have I heard that before? It seemed like the story was always on the verge of pulling me in, but then the plot would take an uninteresting twist, or some incident that could have been explored and explained just got a light skimming. Kind of frustrating. On the bright side, ""In the Rift"" does succeed in moving the story forward through a new set of interesting characters, and points toward a third story. ""In the Rift"" also gives a glimpse of what has happened to two of the central characters from the first book. All in all, a good read, but not a great one like its predecessor."
3,unedited?,"I likedThe War Tapesmuch better than this. While I am thankful for their service and I did learn more about their 'day in the life', the film contained no close engagements. Since I was unable to serve, I like to know what it was like. The heavy fighting was cut or left out, I assume under orders."
3,"Good Information, a Lot of Filler, and a Sales Pitch","This is a good book for solid information on how diamonds are rated, and how to get a decent deal on a diamond. There is also a lot of neat or not so neat stories on the authors experiences in diamonds sales over the years.Really I only found the first few chapters worthwhile. The book also pushes ""bonded diamonds"" and where do you get those? [...]There may be better books, but this is the only one I've read on the subject, and it was worthwhile."
3,"Not much ""insider"" information","Only helpful for those interested in buying round cut diamonds. All of the ""rules"" regarding dimensions, table width, etc go out the window when you are buy non-round cut diamonds."
4,"Fantastic money saving tips, the knowledge to back them up","This author comes with a resume that would make him a king in some small European nations; all kidding aside he is a diamond expert who has imparted his extensive knowledge to the reader with panache and ease. I could not put this book down. I was able to read it in one night and I feel totally capable of walking into a jewelry store and buying a diamond with the knowledge that I'm not getting ripped off. He has even added checklists for choosing your perfect diamond and picking a reputable jeweler. The only thing I found missing were pictures of different things to look for, such as diamonds that have been laser treated, the color scales, kinds of inclusions and blemishes as they look under a 10X loupe which is the instrument used to detect defects in a diamond. It is a good book as an adjunct to other books that might not be as easily read and clear in the technical presentation."
5,Invest in this Book. Pays for itself over and over again,"I recently purchased an engagement ring and was fortunate enough to be recommended Fred Cuellar's book. This is the CLASSIC tome for diamond buyers and provides all the do's and dont's to observe during the buying process. I especially liked the checklist to use when evaluating whether or not to do business with a given jeweler. This saved me from several potential disasters.One thing I would recommend IN ADDITION to buying Cuellar's book is to search for unbiased diamond consumer sites on the Internet. There are a handful of great sites out there that will give you the latest prices, trends, scams, etc. Armed with that type of time-sensitive information PLUS Cuellar's book, you can't go wrong!"
5,How To Buy A Diamond,"I highly recommend this book to anyone considering buying a diamond. It is packed with practical information and great advice from an insider's standpoint. After reading this book, I feel confident that I'll make an informed decision and not fall prey to any of the industry sharks."
5,A true gift from Dr. Dyer to the World,"It is perhaps one of the best books ever written. If only more people read, understand and apply the beautiful lessons offered in the book. Dr. Wayne Dyer is a gift to the world!"
1,Parable Form Does Not Suit Dr. Dyer,"Reading this book, I was frankly embarrassed for Dr. Dyer. It's so poorly written and lacking in imagination, I'm surprised it was ever published. The book is a joke. Stick to towering works of inspiration and imagination, like The Prophet, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia and - dare I say it? - Harry Potter."
5,Should be prequisite reading for all parents and children.,"This is one book I purchase to give away. It is brilliant. If everyone in the world would read this book and practice the principles, the world would be at peace and all would be happy. Crime would be nonexistent. This book awakens a whole new way of thinking. An unprecidented way of reverse thinking makes this book one epiphany after another until you say, why can't this be? This makes so much more sense that the way we think now. Buy it, read it, and give it away for someone else to read. One of the best books I have ever read! Five stars!!!!"
4,It tastes good,It's really taste good and let you feel good too. It's a easy way to get calcium. Only concern is the price is little expensive and can't affort to have it often.
3,Tunes-day review,"The beloved Winnie the Pooh is in another book by Disney entitled Pooh's Tune-day Parade. The silly bear, Pooh proclaims that it is Tunes-day and that Tigger, Roo, Piglet, and Eeyore have to be in a band. Each character is given an instrument to play in the parade. The sound of each instrument is written out after the character plays it. This helps children identify the sounds with the name of the instruments. They wonder around the forest playing their instrument until they reach Christopher Robin. In the end of the book, it asks that the reader join in by using the book as a tambourine. There is a plastic attachment on top of the book that makes a clacking sound. For very young children the shaking the book can develop gross motor skills and actively engage the child in reading. This is perfect for active toddlers."
1,Extremely unappetizing smell & flavor,"The worst raspberry salad dressing available. The flavors (olive oil?) are fighting each other. It smells atrocious... like someone's dirty feet after pouring vinegar on them. And the odor lingers in the air, driving you to distraction.It will certainly make you wash your dishes quickly. There are amazing Raspberry salsad dressing put there. This isn't one. Disgusting"
5,My favorite dressing,"I have had trouble finding this dressing at my local grocery. I was delighted to find it at Amazon. My one complaint was they changed the bottle design by eliminating the dribble spout. Now it is hard to control the amount you put on your salad. When Kraft added the word ""Anything"" to the description to encourage you to use it on more than just salad they opened the bottle neck to make it easier to pour larger amounts."
5,Great Purchase,Perfect for dieting and taste is outstanding. Price is right and I am multiple purchase customer planning more purchases soon. Gotta try it!
5,Excellent Old School Reference,"This is an invaluable reference for making hand-crafted antique reproductions. The book has scaled drawings, step-by-step photos, and is very well written. I highly recommend it."
2,I Was Expecting More,"Perhaps this low rating is based on my hope that this would be a book that could lead to a discussion and greater understanding between parents and children on the subject of Santa Claus. It's not a bad little book - but nonetheless,it is a very short book, and not likely to answer the big questions on children's minds."
1,This was a waste of money,I tried to explain santa to my child with this book and it resulted in my child throwing a fit as well as this book at my head. It competely shattered my child's veiw of Christmas as well as her spirit for the season.
5,Great Praise and Worship!,"This CD is a blessing to have in my collection! The words to each song are listed and I am strict on the words to a song! This Cd has brought me up another level in my Christian walk.Bible Believers, when you are ready to listen & learn more about the Names of God...start with El Shaddai! Amen.Terry (Bronx, NY)"
4,"Well formatted, concise and easy to read","A valuable reference for anyone who may want to look beyond ""reputations"" when investigating the overall quality of various college and university programs. The report provides a concise, direct and easy to read format that makes it a valuable addition to any collection or library.Aside from some minor discrepencies and omissions, the report is generally well organized and is therefore highly recommended."
2,Not very good,"The premise of the Gourman Report is that you can assign values to undergraduate programs. To believe that you can distinguish the quality of a program by one or two one-hundredths of a point staggers the statistical imagination.It is also somewhat incongruous to find that otherwise exceptional undergraduate colleges and programs, e.g. Dartmouth College or Amherst, find little or no place in either the undergraduate majors or overall. This suggests that there is a strong bias toward published research rather than the quality of teaching.Mr. Gourman could provide a much more useful service if he would rethink the purpose of an undergraduate education and revise his ranking system accordingly."
1,Be Wary!,"Rankings are rarely all that accurate, but this book is the least accurate college ranking there is. ""Doctor"" Gorman must have some connection to the Univ. of Michigan, b/c on several lists it is ranked unrealistically and thus suspiciously high. Be wary!"
2,Who is this guy to judge all these universities?,"I guess Mr. Gourman, Ph.D, doesn't care about non-Science field. Unless you are interested in engineering, this report won't tell you much. And the fact that Princeton is ranked as #1 university in the world when this whole thing is published from the Princeton Review just makes me laugh!!If you are looking for info on Canadian universities, go and get a copy of Maclean's. If elsewhere, just forget about checking this out. It only lists one or two universities from each country."
1,Awful Return Service,"I ordered the Pina Zangaro Presentation Jacket 1D, 19.75"" x 17"" it was way too small for my 13 x 19 presentation box, I shipped it back the next day and included an exchange form. I still have not received my exchange or any notification from them at all and its been weeks. Amazon sent me an e-mail saying the amount had been refunded to my card. Adorama really dropped the ball since I still don't have the case and they obviously have no intention of sending me a replacement. What a waste of shipping and time."
5,Reviewing a Progressive Pedagogy: The Developmental-Interaction Approach,"My academic adviser suggested I purchase this book. I am a graduate student at Bank Street College of Education and many of the essays in this wonderful collection were written by Bank Street faculty. I highly recommend this book to any one interested in education.In terms of the seller, the book is in perfect condition and arrived ahead of time, according to shipping estimates."
4,Informative and fun!,"Very knowledgable host, and actually entertaining! Full butchering: Primal cuts, Roasts, steaks, and grind. Extremely practical approach using common equipment found in a regular kitchen.Will give novices more confidence, and help experienced outdoorsmen get more meat out of there game."
1,"Good for maps, but little else","You need maps? Get this. Don't need maps? GameFAQs has much, much better. The FAQ by Matt Hobbs is literally a million times better than this. It's every bit as good as this guide, but actually useful with an accurate item list. Save your money for the actual game."
5,Very Good,This is a very good stategy guide. It is one of the best. I have tried other guides and they weren't nearly as good as this one.
5,Great product; great price!,"One of my favorite desserts, even though it is a diet mousse. My local grocery store quit carrying this product, so I went looking on line. Great price, prompt delivery, and a delicious quilt-free dessert!"
5,Something is not right in Laura's home.,"When Laura's parents divorced five years ago and her mother moved to Chicago, Laura decided to remain with her father, where she could be close to the woods she loved. But Laura's beloved home is changing in terrifying ways. Her father has become strangely distant, and spends most of his time in a locked-up old shed. The wildlife in the woods is acting strangely, as if disturbed by something or someone. And Laura has glimpsed strange creatures. Laura soon becomes convinced that her father may be involved in some twisted, inhumane experiment - and she makes the mistake of deciding to investigate. But Laura will soon learn that sometimes it's better to mind your own business - and she may pay be forced to pay the price of her nosiness with her own life. Because the truth she uncovers is one that someone will kill to keep buried."
4,Really Cool!,"The idea for this book is cool!! The characters, plot, and settings are described great, and makes YOU feel like your there in the story. For a summary, read the book description. I recommend this book for readers 9 +."
3,Great potential but ultimately a flop.,"When I was reading the first half of the book, I was so psyched because it was so cool. The idea was a great one and could have been one of R.L.Stine's greatest. But in the last few chapters, it became increasingly disappointing leading to the awful ending. I wish I could give this one a good review."
5,An Interesting Read,"Although I don't have any formal academic background in Celtic Studies, I found this book to be very approachable. It gives easy-to-follow translations of the original text alongside fascinating insights on ancient Britain and Ireland. For the hobbyist it can be hard to find books on Celtic lore which both are readable and have substance -- this does both nicely."
5,Psychedelic Salsa,"Super cool and tight latin rythm section...but on top of it you will find all kind of electronics, dub delays, scratches (a very talented DJ actually, DJ Hernia). There is even a Theremin. The guitar player is out of this world, a kind of Robert Fripp of Latin Music.If you are eager to try a new experience for you ears, you should check this band out."
4,"Scattered, but fascinating","Despite the title, this book covers a lot more than just the authoring of old Universal Studios screenplays. Curt Siodmak has strong opinions and can't help but mention them at any point in his story (even if he repeats himself a bit). Sort of a raw, stream of consciouss style with a bit more discipline than that. A really good read, covering WWII Europe, Hollywood, and the brothers Siodmak."
5,One that I'll keep with other treasures from baby-time,"This large size book captivates with detailed, gloriously colored illustrations and a story my children love. Mama Bunny puts each of her 26 children to bed, each baby bunny named with a successive letter of the alphabet and corresponding number ""1 was named Abel, he slept on the table. 2 was named Blair, she slept on the chair"". My children have memorized the book and can ""read"" it with me -- it has helped me teach them numbers beyond 10 as well. My kids giggle with delight when I incorporate their names in the book and make up silly rhymes to go with it. This book will definitely go in my keepsake chest among our most precious memories of these early years."
3,A bit too cute for school-age kids.,"I bought this book for a six-year-old and thought it was too baby-ish for him. I would recommend it for the preschool crowd, not ages over 5. While it was nice to hear a more peaceful version of the ""old woman who lived in a shoe"" poem, the rhymes were somewhat predictable and there was no surprise in the story. The repetition may be soothing for young children but could be dull for older kids. The illustrations are bright and cheerful, but very cutesy... why do animals in childrens' books so often get dressed up like little people? I would have liked to see illustrations of rabbits without people-clothes better."
1,loose back,I bought these for my wife for Valentine's day. I gave them to her in the morning and she wore them to work. One of the backs came off (and is now lost) and she nearly lost one of the earrings before lunch of the same day.
4,Versatile.,"I bought this product a few years back mostly to cut brochures. It was nice to find that it has also a pre-cut, the scoring to fold the brochures neatly and a fancy decorative blade, great for cards and scrapbook.It comes with stickers in inches and centimeters, so you can customize it to your own measuring system. It's easy to use and lightweight, but beware, use it with five sheets, no more, else you'll end up messing the paper. The blades are easy to change and the magnet makes the process safe. The one star less is because I think it should have a replacement for the cutting mat, is not so easy to find it. Anyway, mine is a little worn but still works fine.I recommend this product."
4,A good example of the early years of Agustin Lara,"This one is hard to review, as it has some problems in the mix, I suspect in the actual soloist presentation with the orchestra being recorded first, but thats only a guess; I am no engineer. Even so, it gets 4 stars with me, as the beauty of Algara's voice holds up well, and the songs are important, like the very early Maria Bonita, and Imposible, as well as others. This album was done as a tribute, (of course, from the title..), to Lara, and it holds up well in that context, hence the honest 4 stars, instead of 3, but remember Algara is a lyric tenor, and doesn't sing with the power we have become used to with Domingo and Pavarotti. Still a nice offering, and probably worth the price if you like the traditional songs of Mexico, but Algara's two earlier recordings are better."
1,Not all original artists,"Take note of the artists playing these ""classics"". While the songs they chose are indeed (mostly) classics, the bands playing them are not. Not recommended."
4,Icarus - I Tweet The Birdy Electric,"Much more musical and slightly less abstract thatSix Soviet Misfits, Icarus' album for Leaf,I Tweet the Birdy Electricsees them diving straight into melodic free-jazz/post-rock. So something like freepost jazzrock. ""Ganglion"" still has off-kilter percussion, but your attention is drawn to the topside sounds of guitar and electronic piano, even as the percussion grows more insistent and takes over by the end. ""Three False Starts"" has a dulcimer-like plucked strings in different iterations, coming in and out over the length of this long, meandering track. The buzz of strings in ""Gnog"" mutates into something melancholy and dirge-like, while ""Mutations"" is composed of different instrumental stabs. ""Birdz Max"" revels in its barely-restrained chaos, birdcalls notwithstanding. Odd and compelling."
3,I've seen at home depot...sooo,"I was at home depot and saw that Purdy was their ""flagship"" brand of paintbrush. I value a well crafted paintbrush quite a bit and am willing to pay a premium. I remembered to use my amazon barcode scanner and saw this brush on amazon for 25% less, so I ordered it.It is really not that great of a brush....considering its ""high end"". the balance is off a little and the handle is too narrow for a 2 inch brush. its good, certainly better than the cheapo brushes...but not that impressed. I guess thats the rub with a HD. they usually end up picking profits over quality.I'm going back to the Linzer pro impact for a better brush from now on. they hold up great, have good balance, easy cleaning and last a while."
1,Very Poor,"THE PRODUCT WAS VERY POOR GUALITY FOR BAUSCH & LOMP. IT'S A SINGLE LENS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED"
1,NOT VERY GOOD,THE PRODUCT WAS NOT VERY WELL MADE AND QUITE FRANKLY WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT. OVERALL QUALITY POOR.
2,Dissapointed with clarity,I am not an optics expert but I must say that the image presented by this loupe is pretty dissapointing. Only the middle third of the image diameter is clear. The other 2/3 is very out of focus. This is pretty annoying and makes it difficult to use. I suggest not purchasing this if you need a clear image over the entire viewing diameter.
5,the reall thing,"We use these all the time at work for looking at the numbers on very small electronic components, these are made well and very clear"
5,Perfume Bottle,Perfume bottle was more beautiful than expected...I was very impressed when it arrived. Would definitely purchase from this vendor in the future.
1,I was sent the wrong book,I was for some reason sent a totally different how to book than the one I ordered. I am not sure where the actual book went. Very unsatisfied.
5,Best bread book ever!,"My parents bought this book for me when I moved into my first apartment in 1973. My mom thought I'd never use it, but stepdad had faith in me. I immediately made bread, to my mother's surprise, and fell in love with doing so. My favorite recipes are the challah and French bread recipes and I have made them countless times over the years. This book made bread making easy! I have my original copy and continue to make the breads in this book. It is a treasure in my home, too!"
3,"Decent fit, but not $125 worth","I purchased a set of front Floor Liner mats for my '05 Toyota Tundra and am maybe $60 worth happy. On neither side did the hook holes match the Toyota hook locations. They were off by more than an inch. The driver side door edge over the rocker panel was wavy, lifting up by half an inch in a couple of places, and the front corners stood out. I made the mat work only after first taping it down then heating it with my wife's hair dryer. After the rubber cooled, I removed the tape and it was considerably flatter. My local detail shop owner from whom I purchased the mats said he often has to use self-adhisive Velcro under a rocker panel edge, so I did that and it works, though now there is an eighth of an inch gap all along which some dirt and moisture will pass and my foot hits. The right side was fine without help, except for the hook holes. I mentioned all this in an email to WeatherTech, meant constructively, and they didn't reply. No doubt they don't care."
3,Somewhat disappointed,I ordered this for a friend who is agnostic. I did not expect the liberal Biblical quotes so chose to order another book for her. I did read it and found the information very valuable and practical if it were not so full of the Christian slant. I think that one needs to know this before ordering. I found it very appropriate to give to another friend recently widowed.
5,music to remember her by. jackie gleason,"I can remember my parents listening to this music when I was growing up and I had to order the cd. It is music for the memory. Soothing, haunting and definitly relaxing. It makes great backround listening. Many of my friends are surprised when the learn the Jackie Gleason had an orchestra. I also ordered Tawny/Music,Martinis and Memories, another great cd. You must try at least one of the two, you will be greatly satisfied."
4,Why Penguin Can't Fly?,"Quite informative and attractive. But I can't find an ""ISBN/Code No."" of this book."
1,Una gran desilusion,"Este libro ha sido una gran desilusion. Es dificil relacionarse con los personajes y con sus ambiciones en la vida. Uno siente que nunca los llega a conocer ni a enteder de verdad. A consecuencia de eso, es muy dificil comprender sus actos. El libro carece de profundidad y entrelaza la narracion de las dos vidas (la de Flora y Gaugin) muy superfluamente. Es monotono y sin impacto. EL lector espera que el libro cobre impacto, pero ese momento nunca llega. Me fue muy dificil encontrar la disciplina para terminarlo. Vargas Llosa es uno de los mejores escritores de nuestros tiempos, y despues de haber leido la gran mayoria de sus obras, este libro ha sido una gran desilusion."
1,Poor poor printing quality,"Horrible paper and printing quality -- it's almost impossible to read it. Unfortunately, I cannot find any other Hitopadesha book which contains the text in Devanagari and still has a readable text."
5,IT WORKS!!!,"I have been using Metamucil for several months with average results, but it always bugged me that there is sucrose added to it. Especially since it doesn't do anything to improve the taste. I found Yerba Prima at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. Everything about it, including the recyclable biodegradable packaging, no sugar added, and low price felt better to me. I tried it the first time last night and it works AWESOME! So much better than Metamucil. And, I LOVE that I'm not getting the extra sugar that I don't want and need. It also gave me results that were much quicker and substantial than I had experienced before. VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER HERE!!!"
2,Rough,"I am huge fan of fiber supplements and find Yerba Prima to be the best on the market. That said, the whole husk version is pretty hard to swallow, so to speak. It simply does not mix well with liquid. It will work in a smoothie, but not most other liquids unless you have a fairly strong gag reflex.Do yourself a favor, spend a little more money and get the version ground into a powder."
5,works great...,"I bought this and shipment was fast, and product does work. I just have to remember to keep taking it. Its easy to drink and has a slight nutty flavor, no complaints at all...."
5,A+ product,"I have learned the difference between colon cleanse and fiber therapy!! This product is a colon cleanser and works somewhat slow, It took about 48 hours for me but I'm not complaining neither because I have been regulated every since I drank the first few glasses of this stuff and that was about a month ago. this is great stuff and will order more when needed. All the crap wal mart sales is complete junk compared to this stuff. Colon cleansers are a lot more effective than fiber therapy because they really work on you, fiber therapy is to keep you regulated if your already able to poop. A+ product!"
5,the best product for digestive health problems,"I USE THIS PRODUCT AS A SUPPLEMENT IN MY CAT'S FOOD. SHE HAS AN ANATOMICAL PROBLEM AND SHE CAN'T DEFECATE REGULARLY AND SO MY VET SUGEST I SHOULD USE PSYLLIUM. WELL, PSYLLIUM WHOLE HUSK IS MAGICAL AND EXCEPTIONAL. vERY good price too.. AND THE INFORMATIONS I GUT FROM AMAZON WAS EXCELLENT!Yerba Prima Botanicals - Psyllium Whole Husks, 12 oz powderforgive me for my english ...."
5,This really works!!,"This product is really good. When I use it the first time I was afraid that would work as a laxative, but NO it works as the product was specified ""natural colon cleanser"" No upset stomach or diarrhea, just easy to go to the bathroom. I read on a site that was good mixed with vinegar and honey to have better effect. So I do that just as a healthy thing. But by itself is perfect. If you feel any difficulty doing your #2 this one is for you!!!"
4,Great product,"I've been drinking psyllium husk for about 1-2 years. It does exactly what it promises to - easing constipation. Do drink lots of water after eating the husk! If not, you will probably end up being more constipated! :)"
2,Did not work for me,"I read great reviews for this and decided to give it a try. However, this product did not work for me. I was looking for something to help me get regular and it seemed to do the opposite."
4,Yerba Prima Psyllium Whole Husks,"I started using this when I went on a low carb diet 4 months ago, as a way of ensuring I was getting enough fiber in my diet. Great product!"
3,They just doubled the price!,"First off I want to say that this is a great product and the best way to clean out your system. This review, however, is a direct result of amazon cancelling my subscription for this product today and doubling the price! For years I have been getting this product for about $6. Now I might as well support my local health food store since amazon is no longer providing a cheap source."
5,fiber a must have,keep healthy by having your fiber intake each day...i eat my grams of fiber requirements in a day but i love to take this in addition...keeps me regular even when traveling...and my cholesterol is in good shape too. i love this product and will continue to use it every day!
4,"just as good as the powder from Vitamin Shoppe, maybe better","I had bought a bottle of this at the Vitamin Shoppe but found it on here for cheaper and with higher recommendations, and it works just as well as the stuff I got from V Shoppe. The texture is grainier but that is just because these are whole husks instead of the powdery just seeds version. If you have any kind of issue going to the bathroom, this is definitely the solution!"
1,Look elsewhere,"Not sure where some of the reviewers' heads are, but for candlestick charting, this book has beginners patterns in it. For more in depth coverage, Steve Nison's books are best.As far as the KST system goes, there are better.This is a basic book at best in my opinion, and after the initial few chapters on charting basics, it continues into verbiage that to me isn't accepted consistently by seasoned traders or analysts.My recommendation is John Murphy's book ""Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets""."
2,Definitely Overrated,"I have math background and am a beginner in this field. This is the first book I read and gave up after the first three chapters. Presentation is somewhat boring and not self-contained. If you want to learn TA, this is not the book to start with."
3,Regency gentleman needs unworldly help to save lady and son.,"Quintus Dauntry thought he had it all: a carriage, a summer home, a secure place in London society. Until he saw the woman in white. Was she Cecilia Walters for whom Quinn had fancy, or Rebecca Burchett, the quiet vicar's daughter?This book is ambiguous here. Who is the heroine? The ghost story was interesting; however, it was not constructed well. It seemed the story was going into different directions. Was it a romance, or a ghost story? The backdrop, however, was good, worthy of a Merchant Ivory drama, or a Jane Austen novel."
4,Proof-Reader Anyone?,"I very much enjoyed the story-line; however, was totally distracted by the excessive errors/typos found in this book. I'm amazed that this book was published in this manner. Perhaps it would be wise to hire a proof-reader prior to your next publication."
3,Not what I expected,"Love the Bears...Hat's not bad. I am a little upset that it is just a sticker. I could have built this out of a helmet I already had, I'm sure I just paid for the NFL official sticker on this item."
3,lacking,There is too much technical information that really is base. I am not sure if this information is viable today when we need to know the truth an how to be a follower of Jesus Christ.
1,Letters; Not Novellas,"If you are looking for a collection of short stories on theerotic world of domination and submission, like me, you will begravely disappointed. This book, while having some redeemingqualities for those who like to read other people's mail, is sadlylacking in everything that defines a book - plot, characterdevelopment, descriptions, etc. What it is is a collection of lettersand e-mails between doms and subs. There are few descriptions ofactual S/M encounters. If there was a way to give a negative ratingthis book would rate one."
2,I HOPE THIS AUTHOR IS A BETTER MASTER THAN HE IS WRITER,"This book is definitely not worth the money. I was so excited to read it only to be completely let down. If you take all of his e-mail correspondence out, between him and online submissives, the book would be less than 20 pages...and it's a 573 page book!!! You would be more pleased with the book BREAKING THE GIRL."
2,Reading other people's mail,"This book was a great disappointment. Mainly, when you read this book, you're reading the e-mail of some guy who talks the talk and for we all we ever know, that may be all he does. Yeah, he includes a few good pieces of fiction, but that's not worth buying the whole book for. If you enjoy reading other people's boring mail, by all means this book is for YOU!"
4,Not a bad home gym.,"I have the 1500 version of this item, which is very similiar. I upgraded to the power coils and they work very nicely. I am a frequent exerciser and I feel that it does as good a job, if not better, than other machines. It does work all the muscle groups and provides a good warm up. Some assembly is required, so once you start don't stop until it is finished. I recommend getting the power coils and the wall charts."
2,Major pain to put together!!!!!!!,"Oh- my was this annoying to put together. The directions are impossible to follow, I ended up with 3 extra screws-I think they are extra? With that being said, it does give a good Workout-really stretches you out. However, I had to go to Goodwill and purchase a VCR-because the video is a vhs! Basically not worth the $-for the aggrevation!"
4,Help I need the work out video for the Gyrotonic 1000,"Hey I am about to buy one of these machines at my local Good Will store. Its only $100 and it is in mint condition. Unfortunately it doesn't come with the workout video. Does anyone out there who has this machine have one they don't use anymore? I can be contacted at loripass2010@yahoo.com just reference Gyrotonics when you email. Appreciate anyone's help. Thanks.Regards,Lori PassosAnsonia, CT"
5,Our greatest living composer,"As a composer, I'm staggered that anyone could fail to be gripped by this music.That anyone can use the words ""spoiled, overrated"" amazes me. I emphatically disagree with ""A music fan""'s review.I don't think it's ""mind-numbing""; I think it's spiritual and exciting. To me it's the most substantial music being created in our times.I'm really sorry that anyone could fail to enjoy it, and really recommend others to listen for themselves."
4,harmonia in excelsis,"I must agree with Mr. Bartlett, particularly with regard to ""Ceiling."" It may well be because his Violin Concerto and Harmonielehre are so powerful. 4.5 stars.Interesting, and likely intentional, is that two names in the extensive liner book fail to mention two great and glaringly obvious precursors: Carl Orff and Raymond Scott. Without ""Carmina Burana,"" there would be no ""Harmonium."" Orff has his mark all over Adams's gifted and epic compositions. Similarly, though there are glib references to ""cartoon music,"" the polymath engineer/musician Scott is a seminal figure in American music, and casts a large shadow over the witty juxtapositions and sense of play one loves in Adams's work. In all, an excellent career overview."
5,It should be the 1st source book on Native American studies.,"I bought the book, read it, and really loved it. There are a few high-lights. First, its style is very informal and informative -- not stuffy like a typical academic book. This is a complement not a criticism. Second, the content is very very broad, covers some very important aspects of Native American feelings and emotions. Especially, after reading this book, the so-called Columbus day never seemed the same again.It also provides an interesting comparison of the abused Native American ""logos"" of various sports groups and the Jewish-caricatures that decorated several walls and newspapers earlier this century. You will never look at ""Red Skins"" ""Cleveland Indians"" ""Chief Wahoo"", ""Tomahak Chop"" etc., in the same light. They are genuine signs of sickness in the society -- sickness which implores one to make fun of another society in order to generate humor."
4,Native American genocide,Every white person needs to read this book. A real eye opener for us white people raised in the USA and educated in the public system where they blatantly disregard and brush over topics about Native Americans. We owe it to ourselves and the indigenous nations to attempt to understand these perspectives.
1,Please Make Him Stop!!!,"...Now regarding the book....If you are a white person who wants to feel that they have learned something about Native oppression and want to get all angry at the mistreatment of Natives, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for an intellectual stab that falls along the lines of bell hooks, Cornell West then I suggest you read something else. Ward's facts about Native portrayals in mascots, movies and general exploitation are dead on, but his commentary regarding those facts is hard to stomach. His recycled prose is tiresome. He comes off as a whiner and of course defensive. When you read one of his books, you have read them all."

2,Good message - doesn't stick,"I really like this cling, but each time I try to re-cling it to my car window, it falls within a day...."
3,"Definitely not her best,,,,,","I really loved the idea of this story, but it definitely stalled about half way through,,,,The guy was a dunce, plain and simple LOL. And it took almost til the very last page for him to come to his senses.I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as the author's other books."
3,Not the author's best....but ok,"This is not Jillian Hart's best, but it wasn't horrible. Definitely has the typical obviousness of an old-style romance novel. Just ok."
5,Absolute favorite.,"Lost 1, someone stole 1 and I had to replace it..it is such a Blessing Love Love Love it. It is older gosipel but very very moving. That is all I can say is Carlton Pearson is Annointed of God..."
2,Please!,"What I found most disgusting about this film was that the whole point was that Bridget was finding herself as separate from needing a man. From being the tragic girl desperately running after a man. And then she ran barefooted in the rain after Colin Firth. Almost as if she couldn't simply tell him the truth, see him for what he was and love that and had to debase herself as she had worked so hard to erase from her habits. Thats when the film really was a let down for me."
3,Bridget Jones is too easy and desperate....,"The movie was okay...but really, I can't help but feel sorry for women who identify with this character. It's so obvious that she's horribly desperate, but what's worst is Colin says to her ""I like you the way you are,"" spends a half hour with him...and then the next time they meet, she changes her knickers and wants to climb into bed with him. Horrible desperation + no self respect. She didn't even know the guy. Is that all it is now? Go to girls in bars and say ""I like you the way you are?"""
2,A Pop-Culture Cliche,"This is the story of a 30-something unmarried woman w/out any self-respect who snivels her way through life. I suspect there is something sinister behind the reasons why people find this ""entertaining"" or ""hilarious"". It just made me cringe. It's a terrible movie, but in fairness, the actors played their parts well, such as they were. But even the ruse of an actor gaining/losing weight for a role has become a cliche, ever since ""Raging Bull"". Hey, if you want a fat person, why not just hire one? Actually, ""Bridget"" wasn't fat; her clothes were just too small (not to mention tasteless, as was this film)."
2,Too slick,"This ""take off"" on the Jane Austen classic, Pride & Prejudice, is a disappointment, and the portrayal of immoral behavior is an insult to Jane Austen. If movies were kept ""clean"", our young people would not think that immoral behavior is ""normal"". The world would be a better place."
3,Not Just a Chick-Flick,"This is like a 2-hour Ally McBeal episode (except, of course, that our heroine is overweight instead of anorexic), which isn't such a bad thing. With the exception of the corn-ball ending, Bridget Jones's Diary is funny, well-acted and very entertaining -- well-worth the 5-dollar matinée admission. Hugh Grant is excellent as a womanizing scoundrel (at last, a nice departure from his typical sheepish good-guy role), and Renée Zellweger is convincing as a neurotic, insecure, chain-smoking, borderline-alcohlic and overweight ""singleton"" gal. Oh, her British accent is just fine, thank you very much. I think she is one of the most adorable actresses in Hollywood today."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Renée Zellweger plays a thirty-something single woman who is involved with the wrong man while she keeps bumping into the right man.The film has some very funny moments that we've all been through, including having to wear a totally inappropriate dress, resembling something your great aunt may have either worn or made from the slip-covers for her couch, picked out by your mother.I saw this film only because there was nothing else to watch. I was very pleasantly surprised at what a sleeper this was.If you're looking for something different, try this film. You may find yourself laughing out loud - rare enough in these times of films being held out as comedies but are nothing more than a cover-up for toilet humor."
4,Not as bad as the book....,"...even though my opinion of the book was so low that this could mean almost anything.If my opinion of the book was so low, why did I bother to watch the movie? Probably because it was towards the end of a 10 hour transatlantic flight, and I didn't have anything better to do... And I must admit I was pleasantly surprised: the movie - Bridget (and all the other characters) were much more human like than the book characters. I think this is the first time I'd rather see the movie than read the book...I don't think I'll buy the DVD, but people who like this genre might really enjoy it, because it's not a bad movie for its kind."
3,Read the Book!,"This was one of the few times when I read a book before watching its movie version, and I'm glad I did. The book was charming, funny and witty and while the movie did have all those qualities itself, I think that if I would have seen it first, I would not have had the motivation to read the book. The entire time I was watching it, I felt like when they planned this movie out, all they wanted to do was cram the best parts of the book into two hours and kind of force viewers to love it, rather than let the story flow naturally and have them discover for themselves what was so appealing about it in the first place. Bsically it seemed somewhat rushed and strained. There were a few discrepancies in the storyline but none so drastic that they detracted from the original plot. The bottom line is, while it was quite well-casted and acted, I believe the movie failed to fully showcase exactly what it is that is so likeable about Bridget Jones."
4,Modern Relationships,"Shows the problems of having a relationship and wanting to be married in todays culture. We are a divided society with some condeming the need for marriage and others saying it is the only way to go. B.J's Diary does an excellent job exhibiting the mental, physical, and emotional trials of a woman who wants a permanent married relationship. Well acted, written and directed.Very funny and somewhat sad at the same time."
2,"Okay, I suppose, but....","Since when is size 12 overweight??? I thought Bridget Jones was supposed to be, well, fat. They made such a huge hype about Renee Zellwegger stacking it on for this role, but if that is what Hollywood thinks is fat, then normal women have no chance at all."
4,Good RomCom,"This movie has a group of three talented actors, including Hugh Grant playing against type as a cad/villian. Renee Zellweger does a terrific job as Bridget, and Colin Firth does his usual brilliant work. Thoroughly enjoyable, and a sort of iconic romantic comedy. It,s the kind of movie that's entertaining enough for repeated viewings."
5,very funny,This is a fun movie to watch really enjoyed it. Laughed a lot I would recommend this for a fun movie night
5,FUN FILM,I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE MANY TIMES. I REALLY LIKE THE PEOPLE CHOSEN FOR THEIR PARTS. THE PREMISE IS INTERESTING AND WELL WRITTEN. I CAN RECOMMEND THIS FILM. THANK YOU AMAZON
2,Huge disappointment,"I love the book and am not quite sure why the movie even bears the same title. The story and some of the characters have been changed completely. If you haven't read the book, the movie might be more enjoyable, but it's difficult to know."
5,This movie is a classic,"You don't have to be into chick flicks to appreciate this movie. I personally am not into the serious romance movies. This one made me laugh, tugged at my heart strings, and made me sigh. I believe this is one of Renee Zellweger's best performances. I never had a crush on Colin Firth until I saw this movie. His performance was outstanding along side with Hugh Grant's whose wit had me in stiches. The sequel was also a fabulous movie that I have yet to purchase. I also like the deleted scenes and take outs at the main menu. A DVD you must add to your collection. You will never tire of seeing it."
4,Book is better,"But then again I almost always think the book is better than the film. I miss the diary format of the book, especially the report on cigarettes and her weigh-in. Daniel's role seems to expand in the video, I'm sure in part to justify hiring Hugh Grant.If you like the video, which any fan of the romantic comedy genre most likely will, read the book."
3,Peek into her diary,"The concept intrigues you. Peek into a young, single girl's diary and learn all her innermost thoughts.Great concept. However, the transition from book to movie does leave a bit to be desired. It can't be helped. Reading someone's diary just doesn't compare with watching someone's diary.Renee Zellwegger pulled off her english accent and became Bridget Jones. Hugh Grant as a cad? It's about time."
1,actually less than one star..........,"Absolutely terrible movie... Totally american humor set in a british scene. Very strange.. Completely unrealistic portrayals of british life and i must say that after enjoying Renee Zellweger movies previously, this movie has tarnished Renee for me and you won't find me watching any of her movies any time soon."
2,Did the book no justice,"This movie is based on the book in only the loosest of terms. Sure there were occasional lines i recognized from the book and some parts matched up with the events in Bridget's life, but the whole script of the movie was so meddled with, it failed to convey the diary successfully. Needless to say, in the conversion process from book to screen, lots of events were left out and the events that WERE included were distorted. The acting was mediocre by both Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant and the supporting actors and actresses. The only saving grace was Colin Firth's acting, but even then, his character's nature was tampered with by the directors till he was totally unlike Mark Darcy in the book.I say skip the movie.Read the book and use your imagination. You'll be far better off with what you can come up with."
2,Beware if you've read the books!!!,"I was very excited to see the movie after reading both Bridget Jones books. When I saw the video, though, I was disappointed. I understand that it's a movie and that they couldn't keep all of the good stuff, but there was almost none of the good stuff. Sure some of the scenes they kept in there (like the ""Tarts"" party) were well done, but there were some even funnier scenes in the book! I think her friends were only in one or two scenes, and the same with her parents. I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but I'm glad I saw the movie for free and didn't go buy it first, like i had originally planned on doing. Don't get me wrong. I think the actors and crew did a wonderful job with what they were given, I just think that there could have been more done with the script. So, I guess what I'd like you to know is that you should rent the movie first before buying it."
5,this is the best movie so far this year?,"I can't belive some of the reveiw's here. This is the best and most intelligent romantic comedy to come along since noting hill and four wedding's and a funeral ironic that hugh grant stars in all three. Rennee zwellger who was good in jerry maguire and great in last years barly seen and extremly underrated nurse betty is even better here if that is possibile. She's nail's the accent just perfect. all the men out there who normally hate this kind of stuff will like it, am not a big fan of these type's of movie's with exception of the title's noted above and shakspeare in love, I hate sense and sensblity and howard's end, and can tolerate the g paltrow emma not the minisereies Yuk. So if you think this movie is not your cup of tea go see it and you will most liklely be very suprised. Watch for atleat a few oscar wins next year, maybe even best picture."
1,Awful Adaptation,"I cannot believe Helen Fielding wrote this screenplay!!!! Did she intentionally ruin her own book? Unbelievable (and that fake accent is horrendous!). I saw this in the theatres and was tremendously disappointed; I rented it thinking maybe I had been too harsh in my original assessment; however, I disliked it even more after a second viewing. The book's plot is completely ruined here and, while the book is a little shallow, it was a fluffy, enjoyable read. Not so this movie. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth should be ashamed of themselves for being in this piece of trash (and if I'm not mistaken, wasn't Hugh Grant made fun of in the book?). I can't believe how many people praise this flick. It's quite possibly the worst adaptation of a book to screen I have ever seen. A complete waste of time. Let's hope there's no sequel."
4,Zellweger Is Winning,"Bridget Jones's Diary was a best selling book by Helen Fielding and it was only a matter of time before it was brought to the screen. The book is extremely British in nature, so it was a major surprise when Renee Zellweger was cast to play the title role. Not only is Ms. Zellweger not British, she seems to be the exact opposite of the overweight Bridget who drinks and smokes too much and is a self described singleton. Despite the seeming miscasting, Ms. Zellweger is absolutely winning as Bridget. She perfectly captures the mini-crisis's that Bridget faces with charm and perfect comedic timing. The supporting cast is excellent as well, headed up by Hugh Grant as Bridget's playboy boss with whom she has a relationship with and Colin Firth as a stuffy lawyer who her mother is constantly trying to set her up with. But again, this is Ms. Zellweger's film all the way and she gives the best performance of her career and one that garnered her a 2001 Oscar nomination as best actress."
1,Am I missing something?,"Oh boy, talk about being fooled by reviews and this will be my top pick. I remember all the hype it got when it released...I prefer a [different] CD over this one in my DVD collection."
4,"Entertaining, good actors, but does no justice to the book","The film flows very well (you do not get bored for a second), script is smooth and tight and maintains nice rhytm. All the leading cast is exquisite (and Hugh Grant looks so much better in the role of a heartless two-timing bastard than in his usual application of an oh-so-cute puppy-eyed stammering British nancy-boy), the British home counties accent of the Texan Renee is accomplished and good jokes abound.However, the book on which it is based is so much more complex and intriguing. It is not the fault of this movie: only so much plot can be crammed into a limited time, and I should have known better than watch a film based on a book when I know already what's in the book.It will make a very pleasant evening watch, maybe one day you will rent it again, but I would think twice before adding it to my DVD collection."
2,Clearly a Renter,"I was so excited for this movie to come out on DVD. I rushed to my local video store, and forced my husband to watch it with me that night. What a disappointment! I am a huge Renee Z. and Colin Firth fan, but was sorely let down by this movie. Bonus material was cute, but I will not be adding this DVD to my collection."
3,The DVD,"I heard that the DVD does not contain any deleted scenes with Colin Firth. I'm trying to confirm this, before I decide whether to order it. I still might, since I liked the movie so much. However, the movie was severly edited and there weren't enough scenes with Firth to give us much of a clue as to why BJ would be interested in him. Although I'd give the movie close to 5 stars, if there's no more Firth, that's really stupid and it will decrease my rating on the DVD"
3,Just ok,I saw the movie.It was just ok.The plot was silly. It was as if they had the actors and tried to make the story line around them.
1,Ridiculous Movie.,"Why would I care to watch a movie about a pudgy British Twit whining about her weight and her sexlife for two hours??? PURE TORTURE!! Another silly ""Men Bad, Women Good"" movie that fails to even come close to the quality of a Lifetime Movie-of-the-Week. One reviewer got it 100% correct: Women and Men view relationships in totally different ways; we stopped trying to find princess charming a long time ago, we can ""hit it"" and leave - women in general can't (Why women would want to mimick this canine behavior is beyond me). They also see movies differently, I can't think of any guy who could sit through this mushy mess without out laughing out loud or walking out in disgust, or both. What's worse, Hugh Grant tries to act in this film - BLECH!!Not even John Woo could've saved this dreck from stinking."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..............,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.............SORRY DID I MISS ANYTHING CAUSE THE FILM tiring I HATE THIS FILM!!
1,"HIDEOUS, DISTASTEFUL, AND LAME","I wish there were a ranking BELOW 1 star. That was what my wife and I wanted to rank this movie. It was such an awful movie. It was quite simply the worst movie we ever watched.....actually couldn't stomach more than the first third. We turned if off and deleted it from our TIVO. Sexual innuendo is not ""smart comedy"", nor theatrical artistry. There was not a single funny joke at all. It was pathetic. What a waste of time!"
1,What a poor movie!,"Renée Zellweger is far to be an actress and despite all her efforts she can not hide a total lack of talent. She is never really credible. Although Hugh Grant only plays a small part, you can see that he weighs on the movie, creating an umbalance.Please do not fall in the marketing blabla that followed the release of this poor movie."
3,I guess I'm the only one who doesn't love this movie.,"I'm sorry. I really am. I wanted to love this movie. Couldn't wait to see it. I love Colin Firth, and thought the rest of the cast was great. I understand that they couldn't fit everything in the book into two hours (or less) on the screen. I even liked that they changed the plot a little so that I didn't know about everything that was going to happen. But...one of the things I loved about Bridget Jone's Diary (the novel) was her friends, especially Tom. In the movie, they were so watered down! And I hated that Bridget was so...inept, so wishy~washy. I also hated that they made her look so sloppy. Just because she was a little overweight (actually, she looked pretty normal to me) didn't mean that all her clothes had to ride up on her or that she didn't know how to brush her hair. I could go on, but it would get boring. It was a cute movie, but I just think more justice could have been done to this wonderfully funny book."
4,3.7 out of 5,"One of the biggest hits of 2001 and Renee Zellweger's first major hit, BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a hilarious romance-comedy adapted from Helen Fielding's popular novel. Zellweger stars as the title character, a 136 lb. British woman who has a wavering determination to improve herself; at the same time, she also looks for love with her cheating boss (Hugh Grant) and a far-away businessman (Colin Firth). Zellweger is perfect for the role, and brings frequent laughs and forces at least a smile; also of note is the fact that Grant plays a character unlike his typical film role, and performs the role well. Sharon Maguire's directing is very good as well. The film also features a nifty soundtrack. Sometimes predictable, always entertaining, BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a sweet, quite likable comedy that makes me eagerly await it's 2004 sequel."
5,TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS,"I don't understand when people pick at these movies.PEOPLE,PEOPLE, this is not meant to be a documentary on pearl harbor, it is meant to be what it is, a romantic comedy.And what problems do you find here??The movie is intelligent,it is witty,has superb performances(by Renee, and Colin, Hugh, I can take or leave him, he does nothing for me), and is also touching.I absolutely loved this film and feel that nothing works better on rainy days.One complaint:when will romantic comedies stop having the same cookie-cutter soundtracks???"
4,Entertaining film,"This is a good film; superb performances all around, especially by Colin Firth. I have not read the book, so I can't compare, but I know that the author of the book is a co-writer on this films' screenplay. This is the first comedy I have seen in a while that had a serious, meaningful fight (Grant and Firth) instead of one full of innapropriate humor and Matrix parodies. This is also the first comedy that I've seen in a while where someone wants to say something mean about a coworker in front of a bunch of people (Bridget and Fitzherbert), but finds a way to hold back. In that sense, this is not only a comedy, it is a classy film. Bottom line: Rent it but don't buy it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and God Bless America!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Distinctly overrated, Bridget Jones's Diary is nowhere near as fun, charming, or witty as I had been led to believe; little more than yet another formulaic romance, this is not a movie to seek out."
3,not bad,this movie wasn't bad it was an okay film. not bad for a chick flick i've seen worse. it was okay.
4,Great Movie!,"I really liked this movie. I haven't read the book, but now I plan to. Renee was great as Bridget, and I can most definitely identify somewhat w/ Bridget, except for the drinking. lol! The reason I gave it four stars, rather than five was because, 1-Colin Firth character, Mark, wasn't in it enough, for me to really get a feel for his character--not sure how much he's in the book though, and 2-Renee gained 20 pounds for the movie, I really want to know where. lol! You can tell in her face that she gained weight, but the weight on her body looked just right for her. I think she needed a few more pounds on her body as Bridget--that's the consensus I've been getting from people who have read the book. But all in all, I really enjoyed the movie, and will watch it over and over. It's now in my top list of favorite films. :)"
4,Not the book but entertaining,"Unless the filmmakers wanted to make a 6-hour mini-series comparable to A&E's version of Pride and Prejudice, there was probably no way they could reproduce Bridget Jones' Diary as it stands on the page. The film cuts out a lot, including the parallels to P & P. It loses the daily up and down entries referencing the battles with weight, cigarettes and attempts at healthier living, the occasional (and hilarious)drunken postscripts, and some great lines and subplots. On the other hand, I watched it with someone who had not read the book and he quite enjoyed the film and ""got"" Bridget and the other characters. The trio at the center of the story were well served by Zellweger, Firth and Grant."
4,super movie,"This movie, a modern readpatation of Pride and Prejudice, is soo good. I have read both books, and while it is not exactly the same, the spirit of the movie is. Renee Zellwegger plays a great Bridget Jones and it is very easy to relate to her as the average woman. Colin Firth, is of course the perfect Mr. Darcy as is Hugh Grant, who plays a very different character than what we are used to seeing in his movies. I highly recommend this (single or not) if you want a good laugh and a happy ending."
4,"You won't want to put this ""Diary"" down.","Great, hilarious adaptation of the novel of the same name. Renee gives a great performance (with a pitch-perfect English accent) as a 30-something ""singleton"" who tries to lay off cigarettes and booze while searching for a meaningful relationship. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are equally good as the men who are involved with Bridget. Both picture and sound are excellent, with a decent bumch of features to boot. Miramax did a fine job with this DVD. Don't miss!"
3,Entertaining movie version of the book,"I don't know whether I can say I enjoyed the movie, since I spent much of the time writhing in embarrassment for the character Bridget. Although obivously a bit too ditsy for words, who among us can fail to identify with her? Still, I thought the acting first rate and I certainly laughed a lot (when not cringing, or maybe WHEN cringing). My only complaint with the movie is they made the title character a bit too much of a half-wit for me. After seeing it, I skimmed the book again to be sure, and I am quite confident that the Bridget in the book was far more clever than the Bridget on screen. I missed the dry humor, the biting observations contained in her diary. The on screen gal was just a little too pathetic for my taste (and my comfort level)."
1,THE BOOK IS BETTER,OK.. i was so desapointed when i saw the movie. some of the most important scenes were cut out and the ending is not like the book. the cast was amazing but if u read the book you wont enjoy the movie... AGH! So many lost scenes.. i i could rate this at negative numbers i would... i still think u should watch the movie though cuz the cast is amazing..
2,barely Average,having watched this film recently i was told that Zellweger was doing a British Accent&that alone got my attention.first of all just like Hugh Grant I Find Him&Her 3rd Tier Actors.neither too me can carry a film&this is living proof.this film has some ok moments but the cliche Songs that Pump up Zellweger makes this film another Average film at best.it just didn't really move me.
4,A sweet comedy.,Anyone who fell in love with the book will want to check out the film version. It stays pretty faithful to the book and allows you to relive all those funny moments with Bridget. The funniest being the tarts costume party. I love this film because it's so easy to relate to Bridget's actions. And who doesn't like Renee Zellwegger?
4,Love story of the millenium!,"I did not read the novel before seeing the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. Renee is brilliant! She never loses her English accent--which is saying a lot because she is from Texas! The two leading men portrayed in this movie remind me of leading men in The Philadelphia Story, two men competing for one woman's affections. This is a classic love story set in the new millenium. You really feel for these characters and wish for more long after the credits roll! I could see this movie again and again. There is a lot of humor mixed with real emotions- a must on DVD!"
2,piece of fluff,"I have read the book ""Bridget Jones Diary"" probably about ten times since the summer and loved it everytime. After watching the film I see they've killed the book. Despite having an excellent cast they have made the characters completely 2-dimensional. The script writers seem to have edited every bit of humour out of the book and have turned it into a cheesy romantic 'comedy' for the late twenties age group. My only advice for anyone who is interested in seeing this film is buy the book."
3,Typical,"This movie has its charms without a doubt, but I must say I am beginning to become sick of the whole ""pretty girl is a clutz, yet manages to charm her way into hearts everywhere"". This movie is a decent rental movie, but not a purchase. And since when do ""fat"" people wear sheer tops that expose their bras? O that's right, they don't, only Hollywood fat people do."
5,I love this,"I love this movie! First of all I adore Hugh Grant, and his wit hits a homerun in this movie. But, I am a huger Zellweger and Firth fan as well.Who does not love the way Bridget seems to always mock, and humiliate herself, yet win people over in an instant. She's a true underdog, but a loveable character looking for love...and bullocks....trouble, and moritifying moments always seem to find her. I can watch this movie any day of the week and laugh. Plus, it has a great soundtrack."
3,"Renee was okay, but Colin was darlin'","Good movie? Yes. Great movie? No. It's true that Renee Zellweger did a good job with her English accent, and she's a fine actress--BUT, there have to be at least 100 British actresses that could have done the role at least as well, if not better. Thoughts of her in her other roles as Nurse Betty and in Jerry Maguire, for instance, kept intruding and kept me from believing, ""Renee Zellweger IS Bridget Jones..."" Nah. If Colin and Hugh hadn't been so very good as their characters, and if the screenplay hadn't done justice to the original Diary, this wouldn't be even a good movie. Read the book AFTER you see the movie, otherwise you'll just want to slap Renee for spoiling the character."
2,2 stars because Rushdie is in it,"You know a movie's in trouble when Salman Rushdie can steal the limelight from Zellweger and Grant. We watch things happen to Zellweger seemingly at random - there's no apparent motive for the male characters. I've been told that this is the entire point of the film, but if you're going to draw 2 dimensional characters as an artistic choice, it shouldn't look like an accident.Maybe the studio wrote a $300 check to everybody else, but it offends me that DVD's are wasted on this vapid fluff while Drowning by Numbers is barely available on VHS."
1,Worst movie - not for guys.,"This movie is not for guys. I love movies and I was totally irritated by this movie. There wasn't one good thing I can write about this movie. I have always disliked the actress who plays the title character, but I wanted to see what all the buzz was about. Well, let me spare you some money- I would not see this movie if I get paid to do so. It was waste of time (I saw at on DVD). None of the DVD features impressed me.Movie Rating: -2* out of 10* (Worst movie in couple of years)DVD Rating: 3* out of 10"
5,V. V. V. good film,"This is one of the best films of the decade, ranking against the likes of Gladiator and Titanic. It was v. funny and touching. Renee Zellweger is absolutely brilliant: she IS Bridget Jones. It was very amusing watching Colin Firth and Hugh Grant have a fight (girly style). Hugh Grant was totally georgous and Colin Firth was too. WHEN IS THE SEQUEL COMING OUT?!!"
5,Wild joy!,"Hugh Grant is perrrrfectly cast! Sly, charming, and full of ego. Another EXCELLENT British comedy that's both hillarious and uplifting. Leaving the theatre after BJD left me with that great post-movie feeling of joy, the same feeling I had when I left ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" ""Ameli"" and ""Men With Brooms"".Zellweger does a convincing job of capturing the loveable quirks of title character Bridget. Certainly a movie I could watch over, and over, and over agian! Witty, charming and hillarious!"
4,Not your usual Renee!,"This movie is just plain silly. I laughed out loud with this one, and I'm pretty picky with my comedy romance movies.I like the fact that she wasn't your usual [...] actress that you see in so many movies now. And I thought it absolutely hilarious when the music seemed to interact w/ the characters - just as you think the romance is getting sappy the music comes to a complete and screeching halt. HA! I loved it.Then there is the use of the original ""Mr. Darcy"" that you just love to hate, but then find yourself very amused by his sexual tension.On a negative note, there was waaaay too much language. It wasn't necessary because this movie can hold it's own without it.Bridget was a character that I think all women could relate to in some way: flawed. I would like to see more movies made like that."
2,A Diary Full of Cliches,"""Bridget Jone`s Diary"" is, well, just another watchable and predictable romantic comedy. Not that there`s anything terribly wrong with that, but with such praise I expected something better and more original. Well, actually I didn`t, as this type of flick always follows the same routine. This british comedy is neither better nor worse than ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", managing to deliver a decent enough story with competent acting and a couple (not many, actually) funny moments (just funny, far from hilarious). Renée Zellweger is an ok actress, but I don`t really see why so many claim she`s so excellent. She`s appropriate to the role, not terrific, and her character is nothing more than a ""been there, done that"" stereotype about the modern woman. Overall, this movie is an average and harmless comedy, watchable on a boring weekend afternoon and forgettable for the most part.A typical chick flick."
2,Read the damn book,"If you want Fielding's original style, which is often a hysterical and spot-on depiction of singledom, just read Fielding's book. The movie makes all the classic Hollywood mistakes, including casting a beautiful actress in the role of a NORMAL PERSON. It's a cute big-budget Hollywood movie, and like those usually are, it's very forgettable. The best lines in it are straight from the book, so just get it from the source -- your local library -- and save the [money]."
3,surprising language,"When I watch a romantic comedy, I'm not expecting to be bombarded with the use of the f-word, but that was the case with this movie. I had a hard time focusing on the plot because I was wondering the whole time if we're supposed to believe that Brits use the f-word in every other sentence. I remember back when Al Pacino's Scarface was criticized for its language. It didn't bother me in that movie because you expect gangsters to use it. But it seemed out of kilter here and spoiled what otherwise would have been a more enjoyable movie experience. I mean, what would Sleepless in Seattle have been like if Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were saying (...) all the time?"
2,"I really wanted to like this, but...","This is the kind of a movie in which the ""f"" word is treated as a clever witticism. The humor is heavy-handed, the plot points are telegraphed from the beginning, and the characters are loathesomely self-involved. If the people weren't speaking with British accents, this movie would not be nearly so well-reviewed."
3,To long and a waste of Renee Zellweger's talent !!!!,At first the movie is cute but the 30's mid life crisis begins to wear on the viewer all so quickly.Summary: English 30 something year old (Zellweger) woman is having a never ending life crisis for getting married ! Endless senseless scenarios take us to a long overdue happy ending with the most unsuspected guy (NOT).Okay for Zellweger fans but not one of her best.
3,Fun. Funny. Nothing great. It's just a chick flick.,"""Thumbs Down!""Why are audiences raving about this film? Sure, there's a few laughs, but Renee is just using the ""F"" word, the ""B"" word and the ""S"" word--- what is so great? It reminded me of Erin Brockovich, in a way. They have somewhat of the same personality. This film coughs up a few giggles, but it is just a girly movie, men will wanna go to Tomb Raider or Kiss of the Dragon. Bridgette can be cool here and there, but her use of profanity is just everywhere which is the only reason why Bridgette Jones's Diary is labeled as a comedy. This diary is just filled with slop."
2,Read the book!,"Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones? With all of the fine British actresses who could have played this part they chose Renee Zellweger? She is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an acceptable Bridget Jones. It is a travesty- a scandal really. Love Hugh Grant, love Colin Firth, but this movie stinks...If you really want to experience the charm and the hilarity of Bridget Jones please read the book. This movie is a waste of time."
2,Silly Diary,"Renée Zellweger is cute, but pretty FAT here. My wife usually likes this kind of movie, but she also admitted it was pretty silly. The casts are well chosen, the acting is fine, but the comedy is ... duh???"
5,Amazing film!,"This my favourite film. It makes me feel happy, just by watching it. I have seen it so many times already, and I still love it. This is a real feel-good film."
4,SO much better than I expected,"I really, really, really didn't like the book, so I was exceedingly reluctant to see the movie - but wow, it's so much better than I expected. One of those rare cases in which the book falls short of the movie. The book: I just wanted Bridget to quit kvetching and obsessing about every single thing and get on with her life; it was too repetitive. The Movie: charming! A lot had to do with the actors: Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and Colin Firth.It's hard to steal a movie from Grant, but Zellweger manages to do it by playing an inept misfit in society, always foot-in-mouth, off key, dressed wrong - and lusting after the wrong guy. Just in case you haven't see it or read other reviews, I won't mention who the wrong guy is.Order a pizza, pour a beer, kick off your shoes, and have a fun evening. It's not great cinema (and it sure wasn't great literature), but it's way fun."
3,"slightly amusing but overall, boring","I got this as a present, wanting to read the book but the movie is always much easier to find. I must say, overall, the story line is good, but the movie was just not that great. I reminded me of Shakespeare in Love, too much passion, and not enough of a story line. But if it sells, it sells. I must say the one she chooses surprised me but that was fine."
4,cute and funny,"Hug Grant in a diferent role here. Kind of an (jerk).It is a nice comedy, not as nice as notting Hill but in the same way...funny about this fatty little girl, very cute and the Hug Grant shagging all around...To be seen"
4,Bridget Jones' Diary is romance at it's best.,"As the title character, Zellweger shines. This is a classic tale of maybe not getting exactly what you want, but instead what you need. Colin Firth as always, delivers a dignified yet endearing performance. His characters haughty exterior gives way to a good and gentle soul.This movie was great!!"
5,A chick flick my boyfriend liked,"This movie is really funny. I am really glad they made it into a movie because I just could not get into the writing style of the book. The movie was excellent. My boyfriend did not complain about going because it was funny and there was tons of sex. I hope they keep doing that with chick flicks to keep couples in harmony. Bad for 1st dates, but great for established couples. Great movie as is the second one the edge of reason."
5,Just what I wanted,I love these movies and for some reason only had the second one at home. A great movie at a great price.
4,Not enough!,"I really enjoyed the movie but the book, I felt, was ten times better. It was fun to see the characters acted out on the screen. But I agree with another fan that the movie was too short and I wanted to see more interaction between Renee and Colin. Love Colin! Want to see more of him in American movies! Hope the sequel will offer more of Bridget and Mark's relationship."
2,Use it 4 times and the plastic cracked,"I purchased this unit in Aug 2008. It worked well for the last 3 camping trips. The plastic which thread on to the propane tank cracked in my most recent camping trip (7/21/10). Since I used it only 4 times, it averaged out to $11 per camping trip."
1,what Chinese crap !!!!,"I did not even have a chance to use it... I thought that I had better test it out before a camping trip in spring, (thanks to the boy scout up-bringing, ""be prepared"") so I hooked it up... it leaked right away, not out of the valves, but out of the poorly constructed shaft... so back to the individual gas canisters... what a rip-off... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP !!!!"
4,Very good sample,This cd is a very good sample of some of the works of James Horner. The orchestrations are good and I am thinking of buying some of the other artists in the same series. Good and cheap find if you are looking for a nice sample of Horner's work.
1,Music review,The music by James Horner is really phenomenal only it is played by the crappiest symphonic orchestra I have heard over the years. Like listening to a marching band who just ran the marathon......twice!!!Unbelievable how you can turn perfect music into garbage .A Very bad performance from the orchestra.
5,Loved it so much I had to share!,"My sister brought this book as a shower gift back in 1999. I just had my second child in January 2003 and was so delighted to find the same book still available at Amazon.com. I did not want any other book for my baby but this one. It is so unique and the only one I've seen geared towards African-Americans. There's also a little lullaby inside that I sing to my kids. A friend is having twins and I just ordered 2 more Baby's Roots books that I know she will cherish as well. I recommend this book because it will be a ""unique"" treasure ones children will have when they get older and look back at their childhood."
3,"Good price, but not the best quality in pictures","The camera has good things, one of them is the price.The bad things about it are the size, the newer are slimer.Not all the batteries works for the camera.I can not see the different of the 7 pixels."
4,Fairly high quality camera for the price.,"I've been using mine for about a year and a half now, and have been quite pleased with the general quality and range of available features. I use mine with a 256MB memory card, which significantly limits the camera's use for taking video clips, but with a 1GB card this should not be much of an issue. The combination of optical and digital zoom allows you to blow up selected portions of a longer range picture without compromising the quality of the image, although your ability to do this on a lower resolution is obviously not going to be as great. I normally don't use the full 7MP capacity simply to allow a larger number of photos between downloads, but it's nice to know it's there when I need it. Definitely not a bad camera for the price. On the down side, I would note that this seems a bit fragile. I had to send mine to have the lens barrel replaced within the one-year warranty period, despite not having dropped it or otherwise abused it."
2,Noble Experiment,"This group was hastily put together so Dave Guard could fulfill his contract with Capitol Records, and it shows. For one thing, Judy Henske's strident voice is an acquired taste which I must admit I never acquired. However, the groups' rendition of the classic good-bye song ""Isa Lei,"" with nothing but Buck Wheat's bass for back-up, is intensely moving. And Guard's banjo work on ""Bonnie Ship, The Diamond"" is excellent."
2,He should've stayed with the Kingston Trio,"It's not a bad album, had to play it a few times to appreciate it. Not up to par with Guards work with the Kingston Trio, it's different,which it apparently was meant to be.Terrible cover photo."
4,Great Stuff for a Baseball Fan,"In the six years that I have known Madison McEntire, he always referred to ""the book"" that he would someday write, and now he has delivered. I would describe ""Big League Trivia"" as the perfect book to keep on your nightstand. Just before you turn the lights out, pick it up, open to any page and prepare to find something that only a baseball fan can appreciate. For instance, only three pitchers named ""Kevin"" have pitched no-hitters in MLB history, but all three of them came against the San Francisco Giants. (For the record, the three Kevins were Gross, Brown and Millwood.) I love the idea that this is not the usual Q & A trivia book. To me, that makes this a much more enjoyable volume."
2,Not worth the money,"This book is very nice physically, it has great pictures but lacks valuable content. There are a few classic recipes like eggs benedict, but the rest of the recipes are not worth it. If you are looking for good techniques, you wont find them in this book."
2,Beware! No Subtitles!,"Image really dropped the ball here. Although clearly aimed at the Spanish-language market, other similar DVDs include English subtitles for the benefit of us gringos who are Mexican horror fans. This DVD is in Spanish only, so if you don't know the language, you may wish to avoid this one...on the other hand, it is a rare title that many fans have heard about for years, but never got a chance to see, which is why I took the chance and bought it...in any case, be forewarned."
1,If you aren't fluent in Spanish don't buy this movie!,"I bought this movie thinking that it had subtitles, but alas, it did not. I was so disappointed, I am having trouble buying any foreign films online, for fear of wasting more money. What is the sense in watching a film if you can't understand what is going on? I wish that it had been clearly labeled."
3,the (not so) good samaritan,typically great sam jackson performance but average direction and poor writing.if you like sam jackson rent this film.i doubt it will get multiple viewings.
1,Boring!,"After watching this movie and wasting my time and money with it, it makes me worried about Sam Jackson. This movie is really horrible and long for a short movie. It's very predictable and disturbing after you find out who he's dating in the movie. Don't waste your time with this."
4,Starrling Movie,"Found this movie to be above average for plot and sound effects, was thoroughly blown away with movie plot ending."
3,"Okay, wait for Prime","The plot line was okay. Somewhat weak and grasping. Samuel Jackson was not as strong in his performance as normal. Overall, wait for this to be available on Prime. Not worth the rental money."
4,The Samaritan,"This was a good movie, a bit of a sleeper but once it started to roll, it all fell into place."
3,pretty good,"this film had everything needed to be great but missed the mark...not by much, but still; missed. The cast, music, editing, etc. was up-to-par & it beat many expensive films....but still. The director did a great job (first film?) and I hope he gets better stories and bigger budgets. Would I recommend renting? Wait until it's on HBO or Showtime."
4,Great thriller,Love a good mystery thriller without gore! Please make more movies like this. Samuel Jackson as always puts on a stellar performance!
1,"you know what i am saying,? know what i mean.?","Griffffth!!!! yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!! i can still taste this crap & i am certain Sam, can still taste it. like they say $1.00 make you holler. & if it cost more than that to make this stupid movie, i would be more pissed than i am for paying the $3.99 to watch this distasteful crap. PLEASE!!!! drug test the people responsible for this crap. WHY!!! SHOULD WE SUFFER THE OUT COME...?????????????????????? IT'S COSTING (US) ALL IN THE END..."
1,SAM!!!! I CRAM TO UNDERSTAND...WHY???,"This movie was awful. Those expecting Jules of Pulp Fiction Days or Carl Lee Hailey in a Time to Kill or even Lazarus from Black Snake Moan will be sorely disappointed. Sam, sometimes I cram to understand why is it quantity over quality with you? Yes, you are the hardest working man in Hollywood but you don't have to do every damn movie that comes your way. The Samaritan's plodding, meandering storyline with improbable/illogical plot points does not hold anything to the film noir of yesteryear. The only twist(spoiler alert) was incest and that was played for cheap effect. Do not pay 9.99 or even 13.50(if you live in NYC) to see this movie. I wonder if Sam might have dropped a bit from the 1% in having to do movies like this. Sam, your agent ran the grift on you when he passed this script along, Sam's agent, Elan Mastai and David Weaver grifted you, lastly folks out there-don't let them or this movie grift you."
3,Only for die-hard fans,"This album contains a collection of some 50 commercial short works (TV commercials, etc). Nothing exiting here; this is really only for hardcore Sakamoto fans!"
1,Product has technical problem,"This product has serious technical problem and does not hold pressure all times. It is very hard to get a replacement even within the warranty period. I will post more up to date information as I try to resolve the problem.Update: I am still having problem getting the company to honor their warranty. The warranty decisions are made overseas, and they pretty much ignore their U.S. customers."
1,"Retractable action not strong enough, making walking a chore!","The retractable action on this flexi leash is not strong enough, often causing a delay or sagging of the cord when you want it to take up some slack. This makes walking my dog extremely tedious, and dangerous. I also use a lightweight rubber extension to cushion the impact of a 'strong walker' (dog that pulls hard or makes a break for a rabbit, bird, etc.), and this flexi leash cannot handle it. The sagging occurs whether I use the extension or not, but is much worse with the extension. Flexi should manufacture these retractable leashes with a stronger springing action to make them more functional in the real world. I am hoping my pet retailer will take it back and refund me."
2,blood and tears,"This particular item was purchased because my son had heard that it was an exceptional movie from a lady friend. He told me it was a so so movie. Inever saw it myself, so I'll take his word on it."
1,"These are not ""Readings"" but short sayings!","I love Fulton Sheen, but this book is a farce. ""120 Holy Hour Readings""? I could read them all in one hour. How could all of you give this book a 5 star rating? You convinced me to buy it, and I cannot believe how ridiculously short each day's reading is. For example, reading #45 says, ""Every self-centered person is a self-disrupted person. Nothing happens to him-he does something to himself."" That is all you get from Bishop Sheen for that holy hour! The compiler then gives you a little verse from the book of Proverbs. No day's reading is more than a short paragraph. Bishop Sheen wrote such an abundance of material that someone could do a much better job of compiling 120 Holy Hour Readings from all his books. It would be a task well worth it, since Beverly Coney Heirich didn't do it. She put together a nice looking ""thought for the day"" book... not a book of spiritual readings."
1,Try the Originals,"A debut CD that features a nice girl with a nice voice. I will take the Judy Garland and Andrea McArdle versions of Rainbow in a million years and leave Becky to elevator music. Same goes for Julie Andrews or Sally Ann Howe.......Becky walks, they danced."
3,Not enough contemporary authors.,"Too many medieval and Renaissance authors, whose Italian is outdated and very hard to understand. The translation is therefore sometimes very free."
3,Great for intermediate or advanced,I like the dual book concept and it's good for people with a fair grasp of Italian. I'd prefer some more modern stories though.
4,"Excellent book, but above my skill level","Very nicely done, with translation on the facing pages, and a glossary, but I'm afradi I was only able to get through the first two storeis- albeit with a lot of cross-reference to the translation. Still, very nicely done. Use it if you're Intermediate to skilled speaker."
2,Not for beginners!,"I give this book a low rating because it is advertised as suitable for students of Italian, but is simply not a good tool for beginning students. I am a beginner student who can speak basic Italian fairly well, but I had much difficulty with this book! It actually worsened my Italian some with confusing, outdated words.My significant other is from Italy. After speaking with him (a very well educated person who attended liceo classico - Italian high school focusing on grammar, literature, history, and philosophy) and other Italians, I found that the stories in this book are for very advanced students who can already speak Italian.Many of the words in these old stories are no longer used in speaking today. If you are trying to learn Italian, do not buy this book. If you are fluent in Italian, but your first language is English, and you want to learn about Italian history and culture, this book is good for you."
4,amethyst & pearls work,"The bracelet mix of colors works well together. The amethyst chips are rounded, and are not annoying nor poking. The bracelet is big looking with all the rows. The stretch is snug on my 7"" wrist. Enjoy wearing it."
4,The revolutionary was no saint,"Down on his luck, and needing the money, yachtsman Mike Conway agrees to sail to Heureuse, an island in the Indian Ocean a thousand miles from the nearest land, and rescue a Middle-Eastern revolutionary leader interned by the British.However, a native female admirer of the revolutionary begins to have doubts about him on the long sea journey home, and there's a trademark Garvean surprise ending."
4,A four star album,"I bought this album based on the first time I heard Snowy White play with Pink Floyd in a 70's concert video. I heard him again on Roger Water's tour playing second guitar to Doyle Bramhall II lead guitar. I like this CD but Doyle's new effort, BRAMHALL is a much better set. I recommend you buy both of these discs if you enjoy great guitar."
5,Great Quality,"I love Sorme products and this eyebrow pencil is no exception. Great quality, goes on easily, stays put, and the pencil last forever! A bit more expensive, but well worth the cost."
5,Wonderful Product fast delivery!!!,"I have used this product before and I could not find it at the local beauty store so ordered it online. It's a great product goes on well, has staying power and is the right shade for my eyebrows. The product was delivered super fast and was just what I needed. Thanks SO much."
2,Not for normal people,"I gave up on this book. To me it is an intellectual exercise where 1 word is stretched to about 200 words. The author is very much anal (literal) focused and for some reason likes to write about rats. One story, which had nothing to do with anybody who was abused as a child, details how to kill a man by using a rat. Huh?If you're like me and want to understand the inner healing necessary to get beyond the past then I don't think this book is helpful. If you want to know the inner nuances of Oedipus and Orwell, or need to discuss Freud for some reason then there is some secondary value.I particularily did not like the fact that he took the book's name from an earlier child abuse book, which I thought was tremendously better written and more to the point.So, while I consider the time I spent reading this book as wasted and worse, I am glad I got it in the used bin for $5."
1,Maybe the worst GBA game to date,"If its not the worst, it sure gives NFL Blitz and Mortal Kombat Advance a run for their money. The graphics are horrendous. The Genesis version was simpler but at least you could tell what your player was doing.Gameplay is also far worse than it used to be. In my first game, I was missing dunks and open layups but I could hit half court shots consistently. Not fun. Passing, shooting, and running animations are so similar, its hard to know who even has the ball sometimes....yet somehow I built a 10-point lead in the first quarter.And the audio...Oh God, the audio.....Whoever had the brilliant idea of making the announcer say ""Well received!"" after 90% of passes should never be allowed near a video game's production again...EVER.Half-court shots and winning by 100 were more fun in Double Dribble for NES. This game is just annoying."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this game based partially on reviews that I read here.Describing NBA Jam 2002 as disappointing would be an understatement. The pacing is good, but the players can be hard to distinguish, and the play in general is sloppy. The graphics are average at best when compared to other GBA games.I am still waiting for a good basketball game for GBA."
1,Doesnt do NBA jam justice,"I was really excited to get this game. I expected much more than what NBA jam 2002 really is. Seeing all the really good games on the GBA I thought this game would be alike the origional NBA Jam for the SNES. But it isnt even close to that good. Really a big dissapointment, I would recomend you save your 30 dollars"
1,What Happened to NBA Jam?,"This game doesn't even compare to the old ones. There is no create a player and the peoples stats are all messed up. It is the worst use of $...ever- DO NOT BUY IT.Not only can the worst player win by 100, but you can hit full court shots with Shaq. Save your money or buy the old SNES or Genises versions if you are that desperate."
1,Arrrrggg,"This is definently THE WORST BASKETBALL GAME EVER!!!!You can't tell wich playor is wich, the play is SLOPPY,you can make a shot from anywhere not to mention you can get up to 9 points at mid court!"
1,Bridget's Review,"I'm a horror-movie fanatic and one thing that really gets to me are movies based on true events. I started watching Legion: The Final Exorcism and I had to stop it about twenty minutes in. I just couldn't get into it. I thought that maybe it was just my mood, so the next day, I tried again. There is a bit of a creepy vibe to the movie but I think they overdid it. I'm not a fan of this movie, but that's just my opinion."
5,Superb!,This is Linda's finest work and that says a lot because each of her previous recordings are extraordinary! This is a great CD to unwind to and to retreat from the busy-ness of life. You won't regret having this in your collection!
5,Beautiful and relaxing,"I heard a beautiful version of the song ""Friends"" on a local radio station and called them to see who it was by. This is the album they told me it was from, so I decided to go ahead and try out the whole album. All the arrangements on this album are absolutely beautiful! I've listened to it all the way through several times now, and I love it! You will not be disappointed. :)"
4,Cool Trash Can,"This is a really cool trash can. It is truly touch free, just waive your hand and it opens. It is made of high quality chrome, and it looks great.2 things keep this from being a 5 star product. First, the capacity is on the small side, it should be a 13 gallon size, it fills up fast. The can will open if you walk past it, so it needs to be in an area where you don't walk past it. Other than that I really like the Trash can."
1,Alton 11 Gallon Auto Trash Bin,"Trash cash is taller than others items in this category, ""tall"" kitchen bags are too short and result in bag pulling down and out of retainer ring. Overall a poor design unless you plan on using without trash bags. I had other ""auto"" trash bins but none had this problem. Also, top of unit looks like chrome plated metal but is actually plastic with chrome plating. Not worth the money, suggest buying another unit that will take typical tall kitchen bags."
5,English Dubbed Speaking and Singing Voices For Lacus Clyne are Horrible,"Overall, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed - Unexpected Meetings (Vol. 2) is a good volume. But the English dubbed speaking voice (by Chantal Strand) for Lacus Clyne and the English dubbed singing voice (by Jillian Michaels) for Lacus Clyne (""Shizukana Yoru ni"" aka ""In the Quiet Night"") are awful and out of tune. They do not even sound alike. Only the English dubbed singing voice (purportedly also by Jillian Michaels) for Meer Campbell (""Quiet Night C.E. 73"") in Gundam Seed Destiny is more awful and more out of tune. Just terrible."
5,Pleasing regression,"This gundam series is rather like a reimagined version of the original series, with the modern conventions of anime added. Personally, I rather like that they have gone back to their roots and done a serious (by anime standards) war story. Also, while this series is less original than the original, the characters all have considerably more depth. The battles are top-notch as well. I'd have to recommend this to any fan of giant robot anime- the balance of interesting characters and fast-paced battles are a welcome change from some of the other gundam series."
5,Donna,"Great book, I had questions about some of the processes I was going through & this book was really helpful. I do recommend this very highly, Dutch Sheets is a gifted teacher. You will learn something new"
2,Unsatisfied,"1. Flowers look plastic. ARE plastic.2. Arrived in tall box...upside down. Packing foam shredded.3. Unpacked plant, expecting to be overjoyed. Was underwhelmed.4. LOOKS FAKE"
1,"My ""Underwhelmed"" Reaction","This La-dee-da guy has me convinced that I'm in the wrooooong racket. Being a guru is beast. Just cut-and-paste from lots of philosophical and religious sources, add a mystic aura, call yourself my multiple names (apart from Franklin Jones) and look like Yoda, Captitalize All The Meaningful Words and put them into ""quotation"" marks, and people give you obedience and money. Apparently they'll give you lots more than that, too, if the allegations are correct."
1,Don't buy it!,"I purchased the Conairphone TAD1220 on sale at Kmart for $9. It was easy to setup and worked great for 2 weeks. After missing some very important calls I discovered that the machine had stopped recording. It would answer, beep and pretend to record the message, but wouldn't.Conair will replace the answering machine if I send it back with $9.50 shipping and handling (more than the purchase price). Unfortunately I didn't save the receipt."
1,was working for four months,"Recently stopped recording any incoming messages. Was recording, but I found it difficult to save more than one message at a time. Not a very good product."
5,Worked fine for me.,"I was just visiting this product page because I'm giving mine away and wanted a good picture for it, and I was surprised to see the negative reviews. I, too, bought mine at K-mart awhile back for about $10, and it worked fine for a couple years until I didn't need it anymore. Maybe I just got lucky, but I suspect that most people don't have a problem with it, and it's only the people whose macines have problems that review them. Let's face it, no one raves about an answering machine. ;)tl/dr: Worked fine for me. Great value because it's cheap."
5,Fascinating historical information before Christ.,"This encyclopedia helped me immensely, offering pictures galore, charts, and maps. It is written in an entertaining manner that I found I couldn't put down when researching a particular era."
1,Are you kidding me???,"I'll bottom line it for you:1) Not scary2) Not funny3) No Lesbian scenes4) Hardly any nudityWho are they kidding with this crap? I don't think people are buying this DVD for the ""fine acting"" or the ""high production value"" either..."
4,Good B-Movie,"This is a straight to DVD, B-Move. It's quite good, for that style movie.Misty Mundae has been in various films. This is one of her none-sex roles. There's only a little nudity in this film.Misty plays an innocent model employed by a sadistic photographer. That sadist makes a living by terrorizing young girls, and photographing their pain and fear.The latest photo session takes place in a house that was once the lair of a serial killer. who's sadistic pleasures made the photographer's seem like nothing. The photo shoot generates enough fear and pain to awaken his ghost. Trapped in the ghost's torture chamber, Misty and other girls are helpless. The final battle is both action and humor.All thing considered, this was a lot of fun."
1,not a keeper...,"i barely made it throught this book, in spite of what the other reviews said, which is why i ordered it in the first place, i was very disappointed, i found myself skipping a lot to try to get to the good parts but unfortuately, there weren't any...."
4,detailed map,The product got here quickly and was better than I expected. Even though it was a few years old it met my needs perfectly
4,Great story but where was Christy's head?,"I really liked the story. It kept me interested way after I should have been asleep! Most of Connie Mason's books to that to me! But this book...Christy seemed to jump to conclusions a lot. I wanted to rip up a couple of pages and scream at her! But I loved the story line. I think both charactors came to life and I loved how he changed and ate like a horse and ""beefed up"" when he was with her. I wish Connie could write books as fast as I can read her books! I can't wait until her other two on the Sin Series! Make his sister a real spit fire! ANd what about his brother! He is going to be one sexy man with one sexy story! You go girl!"
2,Could have been much better,"I started out liking this book. Sinjun and Christy are married off against their wills, but thankfully, it's a marriage in name only.Years later he's known for bedding whatever's available and she wants to have his child, since it will mean that odious clansman Colum won't try to have her marriage annulled so he can have her to himself.Christy assumes a fake identity and seduces Sinjun, when she eventually leaves, he is distraught and then he finds out that, hey, his wife in Scotland is pregnant!The plot was intriguing, but Sinjun was pretty much nothing without Christy, and that's not romantic. All he did was drink and waste away, and that's not attractive. And all Christy did was lie over and over, and that was most cruel.The endless love scenes are more repetitive than anything and all in all, not a book I enjoyed."
2,Pleasant but lacking,"I love romance novels, and read four or five a week. While Mason's previous works have all been good reads, I found the immaturity of this heroine very hard to stomach. Sinjun was also less well-developed than I would have liked. The secondary characters were much more interesting. This is not to say that I am sorry I read the book... Mason has real talent, and gave me some very good moments. I just wished there had been more of them. Could the romance writers out there please offer a few more characters like Anne...instead of these infantile females paired with men a decade older? Oh for another lead character like the one in Roberta Gellis' ""A Woman's Estate""!"
2,My first disappointment from Connie Mason,"I am a huge fan of Connie Mason, having read most of her other novels. I was disappointed with this one, having to make myself finish it. A great story line, but little character development and an unbelievable love. The characters aren't likable and the female lead is downright stupid at times, constantly making dumb decisions and ignoring easy solutions. The hero of the story starts off extremely shallow and only partially redeems himself in my eyes. Their love isn't believable and far from convincing.While I still love Connie Mason for daring to go where other authors won't in her earlier novels, I can't recommend this one."

5,movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, brought back alot of good memories, I would recommend this movie to others. came quickly and no damage."
5,Nostalgia Inc,"I just love this DVD. The talent is more along the lines of Lawrence Welk, very good but it's not the Met. This is a fine, cozy, trip to a place I want to be for the holidays...not the unsettling, hectic place that my home becomes. We should all live in this DVD."
2,OOPS,"MY MANTTRA STAINLESS PRESSURE COOKER DOES NOT LOOK LIKETHESE PICTURES. MINE HAS TWO HANDLES ON THE LID. I HAVESOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT....(1) THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN IS NOTLEVEL, IT IS RAISED IN THE MIDDLE...SO IT DOES NOT SIT FLATON MY STOVE. (2) IT DOES NOT JIGGLE, SO I CAN'T TELL IF INEED TO RAISE THE HEAT, OR IF IT IS ABOUT TO BLOW UP. IHOPE THESE ARE BETTER THAN MINE. BY THE WAY, I LOVE USINGPRESSURE COOKERS - BEEN USING THEM FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS."
3,Not good stainless steel,"It is my understanding that how well a magnet sticks to stainless steel indicates its quality. Well, a magnet hardly adheres at all to this pan, so it would seem that it is not very good stainless.I am undecided as to whether I will keep it or not. Other pans that tested similarly that I've kept soon pitted and discolored and put who-knows-what into my food. Suppose I could place a glass baking dish in it when I use it. Anyway, have not actually used it to tell how it works, only this observation."
2,Mantra Pressure Cooker,"I purchased a Mantra Pressure Cooker. It worked well after a number of uses. Shortly afterwards, the cooking ability of the Mantra started to diminish. The handle would shake and water would leak out from the handle and the circumference of the cooker. After a few more cooking session, the steam/valve stopped working. I finally trashed it. Not sure if I had a defective one?"
2,This don't get it done....,After the very first all star on the 64 I would look forward to the upcoming all star baseball games...Needless to say the ORIGINAL all star '99 is still the best in my opinion. If you have played that game then you know what I'm saying here. The playability was great as was the create a player. Each remake gets a little worse and unbelievably this ones THE WORST.Bummer.....I see that all star '03 is already coming out!! They must know that this game falls short.
3,average at best,"This game certainly is entertaining, but ultimately dissapointing as the graphics and gameplay seem below par to what Gamecube should be. Pass on this one and wait for EA SPORTS to release their version as EA clearly makes the most superior sports games."
5,A really fun game!,"I bought this game along with my gamecube and I love it! I am a big baseball fan, and this game is the most realistic one I have ever seen! Player batting stances are amazingly accurate, and the pitching motions are perfect accurate too! Plus, what I found cool was that certain pitchers' best pitches are accurate too. Kaz has the nasty splitter, Darryl Kile has a great curve, and Pedro has everything working for him! I strongly recommend this game to everyone!"
2,"Sad Game, for a good series",The all star baseball series is great. Personally i think this is the worst one. This has horrible camra angles. The game overal i would give a D+. I am waiting for the 2003 game which i hope will be better.
2,Mixed Emotions,"First off, the more you play it the more this game [isn't good]. The Rookie mode is way too easy, and the Veteran mode makes outfielding (because of the camera angles) impossible. And every game from there on just gets tedious.The graphics are fairly crisp, and some games are exciting and fun, but for the most part: THIS...GAME...[isn't good].Looking very forward to their upgrade to 2003, which should be out soon.Disappointments: AI, camera angles (which player has no control over), limited creativity, shallow commentary (which there is not much variety to), player models and faces (all the same), fielding control, no ""player of the game""Pleasant Surprises: animation, stadiums, batting control, Box Scores, Cooperstown teams, deep stats"
3,Ok Baseball Game,"This game is ok on the Gamecube. After playing Madden 2002 and Star Wars Rogue Squadron, I guess I was spoiled. Those games have amazing graphics and are very fun. All-Star Baseball has good graphics but definitely don't utilize the full potential of Gamecube. The gameplay is not too difficult to learn but some of the movements are jerky and the players aren't very good base runners. I definitely recommend Madden and Stars Wars, they are much better games."
2,"This game is like the Cubs, ""Wait till next year"".","Next year is all we can hope for, because All-Star baseball 2002 is an absolutly [bad] showing from Acclaim. The 2001 version for the N64 was much better. If I was Acclaim I would have used the: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" slogan, but they tried to make a good thing better and destroyed it. The biggest problem of this game is the ammount of time it takes to play a game. Do you have an hour to an hour and a half to kill? Then play this game. My suggestion: Wait for All-Star Baseball 2003."
2,Not A Good Game!!,I bought this game with high expectaions! It totally let me down. I didn't care for the way the batters swung. Too many other things to type.
4,Good play . . . bad errors,"This game has wonderful graphics right down to the mascot. However, glitches in the game make it hard to really enjoy the game. Such as players running through walls to catch foul balls. Batting and pitching are pretty simple. If you can get past the glitches this game is fun and entertaining. Trust me this game does not play on didactic platitudes."
2,"good graphics, but....","I'll start off by saying that the graphics are really good for this game. But, there are major flaws. First, the hitting is darn near impossible. I'm in the middle of the season and I'm second to last in the ML in hitting. It's really hard to time the ball and predict where the ball is going to end up. But, the flip side is that the pitching is good. I'm leading the ML in that. It's not hard to get strikeouts and the strike zone for the most part is fair and you will get the pitch called if it even hits the corner of the plate. Autofielding is not bad expcept that when a ball is hit against the wall, the other outfielders end up fielding the ball instead of the outfielder where the ball was orginally hit and the runner will end up on third. I would have given it more stars, but the lack of hitting is really flawed and terrible in this game."
2,not so realistic,"Not very realistic at all. If playing against the computer and you are ahead your players start to make errors on routine plays. At times some players won't even make a play on the ball. Even your relief pitchers leave the ball hanging over the plate when you are ahead. Also the commentary just plain stinks, it is very repititious which quickly becomes boreing. I suggest you wait for a different baseball game and rent this one until then."
3,A nice game for N64,"If this was a N64 game I would have no complaint. They should have spent more time programing it for game play. Who cares that the rosters are accurate and the stadium renderings look real?I rounded the bases while the fielders stood a looked at the ball, the game locked up when I tried to score on an infield error. And who needs to hear for the fourth time in the game what Bob Brenly thinks about a players ability. Just shut those guys up all ready.....Perhaps I was too generous with three stars........."
1,This Game Is sooo Bad!!,"THIS IS A HORRIBLE GAME. WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE MY DISGUST FOR THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE. THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME IT IS WHAT IS WRITE WITH THIS GAME. THE ANSWER, NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH AT ALL. THE BATTERS BATTING STANCES ARE PRETTY ACCURATE BUT THAT IS ABOUT ALL. ALL-STAR BASEBALL 2002 IS A TRAIN WRECK!!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON SOMETHING YOU WILL ENJOY. YOU DO NOT NEED THE STRESS AND FRUSTRATION THIS GAME CAUSES. ANYONE GIVING THIS GAME A GOOD REVIEW EITHER HASN'T PLAYED IT MUCH OR HAS NEVER PLAYED TRIPLE PLAY BY EA SPORTS. AND THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. WAIT FOR TRIPLE PLAY."
2,Leave this game on the shelf,Very disappointing game. Batter control is overly complicated and running the bases is hard to control. Even the graphics are below expectations. Skip this one.
5,Hard to read for the laughing!,I get so tickled reading this book to my kids that I have trouble reading it. Mr. Frumble is very accident prone and so this book is one tragedy to the next.
1,Screen Cracked after 1 yr,The screen cracked on me and i am sure i did not hit it anywhere. I also read other people having similar issues with skagen watches. I do like the watch but can keep buying a new one every year.
3,Nice watch but...,"This is a fine watch but I noticed a few drawbacks:The date dial is so so tiny, you almost have to squint to see the date. I've never been able to just take a quick look at the date and read the number without staring at it for a number of seconds.Secondly, for some reason it pinches the hair on my wrist fairly easily.On the positive end, very nice leather band and light weight with a very slim 6mm case thickness which is rarely found."
3,Great watch but frigile crown design,"I love the look and feel of this watch. I hate the fact that the crystal broke within 3 months from a bump while I was wearing it. The design causes the glass to protrude out and become a target for knocks. It is also very thin and therefore fragile. Wear it with care. BTW, the repair shop charged only $40 to replace it but it should not have been broken to begin with."
1,disapointed,This product claims it dries even when wet- It doesnt. You can only use to stop leaks that arent leaking anymore. Any water on this product and it turns to mush. I will never buy this product again. Duct tape would have worked better.
1,hole,"wow i am impressed, how can a brush cleaner come with a huge hole in the bottom? Like I said I am impressed with how completely useless this is!!!!!! Maybe mine was defective but over all its not worth the risk. The hole looks like it was patched up but the patch fell off or something... the whole thing looks used... it came scratched and in bad shape."
2,"Yes, there is a hole at the bottom","I saw this caddy at Michael's before but I decided to get it from amazon because it is cheaper here. I have to say I really like the design of the caddy. It has the perfect size and there are some holes around the edge of the caddy so u can put ur brushes. BUT, There is a hole at the bottom of the caddy, so when u put water in it later u will find ur caddy actually can pee. Well...I use my glue gun to fix the problem, but I know not everyone has glue gun, and to some ppl they will be really disappointed about this hole. I suggest if you want to get this caddy, you should go to Michael's so u can check the caddy instead of get it from amazon."
3,One stroke folk art brush caddy,"Have not used it yet, but did not immediately figure out how it was to be used without instructions (think it fell over or something)."
4,An amazing sequel but...,"Gameplay-The ships are easy to control, and the buttons are very easy to tell apart unlike the Xboxes controller. Each button plays an important function and the ships all steer great. (5/5)Graphics-This game looks incredible. From the Battle of Hoth to a water level everyhting looks amazing. You will notice small things like the Hoth Soldiers running around and much more.(5/5)Challenge level-This is a tough game and will have you wanting to throw your GamCube out the window. After you get passed that though, what you have is an awesome game.(4/5)Sound-Maybe the best part of the game, the voices are amazing and the music really get you into it.Comments-The only gripes I have about this game is that it can be a little challanging. Other then that you got a great game that should not be overlooked because of minor flaws. If you have any interest in StarWars or need a good game for your new system this is one to get. I am not a starwars fan however I loved this game."
5,Awsome,"although it has extreamly good graphics and gameplay it [stinks] that u cant save in the middle of a mission-if you die 3 times u have to replay the whole mission. Also theres no multiplayer and hardly any repay value, but it is fun..."
4,Definitely worth a rent but...,"If you've ever played this game even for a second, you'll know that the graphics and sound are top-notch. Yet the gameplay on some missions can be frustrating or even hard to understand. For instance, on ""Prisons of the Maw"" It took me a long time to figure out what they meant by ""shield generators"". And on ""Razor Rendezvous"", it is really hard because there are soooooo many ties. You should definitely rent this, but only once."
2,Frustrating Game,"I gave this game 2 stars due to the great graphics and audio. Otherwise, a very frustrating game. Almost every level has a TIE fighter shooting you from behind the whole time. Whereas the first two Star Wars games were (and still are) fun to play over and over, I just want to finish this one all the way through one time and then give it, or throw it, away."
2,RENT IT !!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!,"The one and only good thing about this game is the graphics, they are for lack of a better word AWSOME, but the overall game (disappoints)!!! First off you can't see very well in some of the missions because of dense background objects, and the targeting computer doesn't help much because you can't lock on to targets. So trying to take down an enemy is pretty difficult. Second the playable views in the game aren't very user friendly and tend to become very awkward at times. The third and probably the most disappointing aspect of this game is its lack of good game play. The missions become repetitive and boring after awhile. So if you looking for a good title for your Gamecube try NHL Hitz or Tony Hawk. DON'T buy this one rent it and save yourself the (money)."
5,Awesomeness,"This is a great addition to the Star Wars line up as well as the Game Cube line up. When you play this, it is almost like you are playing the movie."
2,"Pretty game, but Xwing had better gameplay","Granted, this game is pretty, but it just hasn't sucked me in the way the XWing did. This game is a shooter, and the controls aren't really that intuitive. You have very little control over your speed, and the missions haven't excited me either. The game's difficulty ramps up rather quickly.I preferred the old X-Wing style _simulator_ experience. I wish that LucasArts would produce another title in that series. With modern graphics technology, it would be beautiful as well as fun."
3,A good Star Wars game,"I've played Rouge Squadron and Battle for Naboo which where better than this game in some ways and worse in others. It was too short and the difficulty seems to change from easy to hard and back to easy and so on. The graphics where amazing, the most impressive part was on this level when AT-ATs attack the cruiser you're supposed to protect a curuiser landed on a planet. The AT-ATs walk through water I can't explain it you'll just have to get the game and see for yourself. I'd really sugggest renting it because if you've it's gets boring after the first time through (unless you've unlocked the 5 bonus levels)."
4,a great game buttttttttttt.....................,its just to hard for me im sorry i sound like a woos i know but its just redicolusly hard. It has great graphic though and somewhat fun gameplay. but i dont like it that much.Other than that its a great game for star wars fans.
4,good but far from the N64 game,pros. real starwars levels like the attack on the deathstar and the battle of Hoth. wedge Antallies real voice. cool star wars aircrafts like the x-wing and the millennium falconcons. it is impossible to unlock everything whitout cheats. levels are to long. Chewbacca is not plyable. the n64 game is better
2,Very poor game,"This game was one that was hyped for at least a year by the magazines. After playing previews, magazines still gave good hype. Finally played it....bad stuff!! Very slipshod game play, lack of control of fighter craft, vague mission. Almost impossible to get gold medals, short game hides behind gold medals and statistics, asking you to replay the game over and over to attain performance results improvements.What we have here is a substandard shooter, not up to even the old ""defender"" or gradius games. Great background graphics covering a very poorly thought out gameif you want a brilliant game, try ""Metal Gear Solid2""...even has some shooting!"
5,AWESOME! A MUST HAVE !!!!!1,"I just bought this game today at the gamecube launch and it is UNBELIEVABLE. The graphics are amazing, i coulndt tell this game from the real movie.NOt only doesthis game have good graphics, the gameplay is gr8 and it is fun and very addictive. This is definately one of or the best GameCube game out. GO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"BUY, BUY, BUY!","This game is definitly worth the money you spend on it whether it is for the beautiful graphics, fun adventures or spectacular sound. For any ages this game is going to be well talked about among GameCube owners and other console owners."
4,This is one of the best here...,"With stunning visuals and an encompassing storyline, Rogue Squadron II (hereafter refered to as RS2) is a must-buy for any fan of the series. When playing the game, it looks as though you're watching the movie, but controlling it with your extremely comfortable Gamecube Controller. This game has some interesting levels, some mediocre ones, and some that are just boring. The medals are INCREDIBLY hard to earn, and without cheats, some of the levels are impossible (okay, just really hard). Just because of the level of difficulty, I have to count off a star, but this is one of the best games around."
4,"This is pretty darn good, just WAY too HARD!!!","This is a great game especially for Star Wars fans. It is just way, way too hard for me. I wish I hadn't bought it now, it seems like such a waste of money. But, if you think you can take on the challenge, go buy this game right now, it makes a great addition onto your Gamecube collection!"
4,Rouge Leader for NGC,"This is a great game. Graphics and sound are great. Why I gave it four stars is because some parts of the game are really tough, specifically the Battle of Endor level (you try blowing up three star destroyers with an a-wing) and the last level. Overall, a great game."
3,Star Wars,This star wras game is pretty much the same as most of the others except it has better graphics. Almost all of the missions are from previous games. The controls are clumsy and replay value low. This Star Wars game is only for hardcore Star Wars fans.
3,ROGUE LEADER DOES NOT LIVE UP TO HYPE,"I purchased Gamecube specifically for this game. I really didn't find anything different from it's predecessor. The general concept, gameplay and graphics are relatively the same. I hope Rogue Squandron 3 is worth waiting for GC."
3,A New...Stars Wars Game?,"Okay, why am I not surprised? I mean there are more Star Wars games out there then there are Mario games! Is that bad you ask? Well no actually, and this game is perfectly fine (And fun), but well...all the Star Wars games are kinda the same thing! I mean think about it, if you're not playing someone on the ground with a light saber or a gun then your in the sky pioleting some, well...ship! I wish LucusARTS would slow down with the Star Wars games and bring us more original games like Monkey Island!"
2,VERY HARD,THIS GAME IS TO HARD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARNT OBSESED WITH IT. NOW I HAVE ONE LEVEL I CANT BEAT SO IT IS BORING. THE CODES I USE DONT WORK.I WISH I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOT IT.
3,Loading... Please wait,"The graphics are great, the sound is adequate, and it's pretty fun. Unfortunately, when one fails a scenario (a frequent occurrence), it's back to the ""select a mission"" screen -- accompanied by long pauses while it loads, and more pauses as it loads the movies to introduce the mission and ships. I've already seen those movies a dozen times! Argh!Luigi's Mansion, by the way, does not suffer from this weakness."
5,10 stars not 5 stars,"In my opinion,Rogue Leader is the best GameCube launch title by far.I can't remember the last game that got my heart pumping like this one.My hands were even shaking after some missions,I guess it's the combination of classic Star Wars scenarios you go through all three movies here and an incredibly well designed,beautiful game.And it ain't no cakewalk,either.If your skills aren't up to snuff in any of the missions at least all but one exceptionally easy run near the end,anyway you'll definitely find yourself floating home.But despite the difficulty,it's almost impossible to put Rogue Leader down,and that's the sign of a truly great game."
5,Mind-blowing graphics and incredible gameplay,"Its hard to describe Rogue Leader without using a long list of superlatives. The graphics in this game are so good that they're often distracting... seeing hundreds of asteroids in one level, dozens of tie fighters in another, its really amazing. The gameplay is excellent too, you really feel like you're flying missions straight out of the movies. Most of the missions follow scenes from the movies, though there are a few added to flesh out the game. Players have the oppurtunity to fly a variety of ships from the movies, and theres secret levels and hidden power-ups to search for too. Rogue Leader is not the longest game in the world, most gamers will finish the basic set of missions in 10-20 hours, though they can be replayed to improve your score and open bonus missions. I highly reccomend Rogue Leader to anyone."
5,May the Force Be with You,"Rogue Leader is the perfect Star Wars flight simulation. From the detail on the Imperial Star Destroyers to the vivid soundtrack, this game has everything a Star Wars fan could imagine. Personally, my favoritie levels are those where you control a TIE Fighter and fight for the Empire. If you love Star Wars, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
3,This Game Is OK....,"I just rented this game and i was surprised it wasn't what i thought it would be, the graphics are great,the sound is good, but the fun factor is not all that great, overall i would give it a 7/10.This game is still worth a rent."
5,Amazing!,The most amazing game I have ever played. The graphics are the best I have ever seen and the game play is wonderful. (...) I hope everyone gets this and if you do I promise you will not regret it.
1,"All hype, no substance","Like the new Star Wars movie, this game insults the Star Wars franchise with a sloppily put together production and buggy gameplay. The graphics is second-rate compared to top PS2 or Xbox games, and the action gets tedious after the first level. Basically I see very few redeeming values in this game and it's an insult to both Star Wars and the GC."
5,(...) Kicker,"Possibly the most anticipated release for the nintendo gamecube, Rouge Sqaudron 2 is the best Star Wars game ever for kids of all ages, even if you hate star wars, i gaurantee you will love this game!"
2,dont like,not fun and its hard thank god i rented it cause this game [stinks] its not worth [junk] rent it and find out ur self
4,"Great Game, but needs more clues..","This is an all around great game. I don't like flying games, but this one is very well put together. I have one major complaint, the levels are difficult to figure out what you need to do... The game does not brief you on your missions at all, which leads to many frustrating continues, where you just don't know what needs to be done. Get Tony Hawk first, but this game is a keeper!!!!"
5,Star Wars Rouge Leader: the best Star War sgame created,"This game has more graphics, more sound, and more everything than any other game of its genre. I believe that this game's detail is beond that of the great ""xbox games""and, ""PS2 games"". Once again the great people at Lucas arts have pulled another show stopper. I have been waiting for this game a long time and it was worth the wait. I recommended the game to all of my friends. The graphics are so great, I'm blown away using a TV that's NOT EVEN DIGITAL!!! If you think this game is terrible, I urge you to try it.I saw the light reflect off the head of a pilot in a cockpit of a fighter!Please rent or buy this game!"
5,The BEST Star Wars Game Ever.,"Rouge Leader is the REASON to own a Gamecube. I own it, and it Greatly Overpassed my expectations. The Graphics are simply amazing, and the gameplay is more intense than almost any game out there. I thought that the controls would be confusing with all the different actions, but I was totally wrong. It took me about a minute to know all of the controls. I don't know how anyone would not be able to operate them. PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS GAME. (...)"
1,It was broken,It was broken. As in did not work. But I didn't feel like going the trouble of returning it and the headache that goes with it for such a small purchase.
2,ok game,"i would say 2 and a half, it was fun to play but boring only to have 1-player. Was disappointed in that.This kind of a game should have multiplayer always, otherwise unlocking eveything is just so less special.I woulda given it 4 stars if it would have been multiplayer."
5,Luke is back! Along with R2D2!,"The must have game for 2002! This is one of the launch titles for Gamecube and the graphics will blow you away! You fly X-wings, A-wings, B-wings, Snowspeeders, and BONUS Craft that you will obtain by completing certain goals. If you have all four Star Wars N64 games then you have to get this one. Even if you have Star Wars Starfighter for PS2 you should by a Gamecube just for this game! Their are 11 missions plus extra bonus missions. Long live the Alliance! You can even strafe snowtroopers in the Hoth level!"
4,Fantastic arcade style space shooter.,"Easily one of the best titles for the Gamecube and among the best produced for the Star Wars franchise. If you own a backwards compatible Wii or the original console and don't happen to own this title you are missing out. The game has a forgiving learning curve while always maintaining a decent skill cap for seasons gamers through it's medal system, if you find clearing the levels and finding the hidden items to be easy odds are you'll still find challenge in trying to gold every mission. There's plenty of replayability to be had in this game, it's a light pick up and play title that can act as a great starting point for introducing Star Wars to younger folk. Graphically it holds up well today, I'd say, though it did seem to suffer from a lack of anti aliasing on an HD display.Overall it really is just a great title to pick up if you can."
3,Rogue Leader,"This game has a great concept and great graphics. The reason I rated it so poorly is that I don't feel like playing every level like 100 times to beat it. Also, for me it has no replay value. I'm going to sell it and buy Sonic."
4,Rogue Leader Standing By (what not Luke?),"Well actually 4 1/2 stars. It is an awsome game and the graphics are great and the sound is even better. The only problem is that there are not enough levels. Beside from that, and the fact that you are only Luke in about three maybe four levels, it's a great game. Oh and by the way since your not Luke in the game your Wedge Antilles taken' on the Empire and might i say doin' a good job. Anyway... I beat this game and let me tell you it really is a hard game in some areas so i would not recommend little kids to get it. Probably between the ages of 12 and up. Yeah, that's about right. Over and out. Oh and good hunting Wedge it's counting on you...."
4,Star Wars Rouge Sqaudron 2 Rouge Leader,"This game rocks, but don`t spend every moment on your targeting computer. Don`t get your hopes up when you're on the last level. It`s way hard! I liked all of the ships, but my favorite is the X-WING. I`ll give you a challenge! Try to lasso AT-ATs in cockpit mode without using the c stick to look around. I`m giving this item 5 stars because of the awesome graphics and the cool ships."
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is cool because its graphics are excellent. My favorite level is were you have to protect a commando squadron by bombing AT-PT and AT-AT. Trust me you HAVE to buy this game.
1,Great graphics marred by poor gameplay,"The developers hired by LucasArts did a fantastic job at making this game, graphically, everything you want a Star Wars game to be. The effects are spectacular, period. Unfortunately the gameplay is too complicated for most gamers (unless you are a diehard Star Wars fan), and it immediately takes away the fun. I recommend you rent the title first to see if you like it."
2,Not a great buy,"I was a fan of the first installment of Rogue Squadron, but I'm not impressed with where the series has gone. The main problem for me is visibility: TIE fighters are tiny and almost impossible to see (especially in space battles), making taking them too much of a challenge. They added a targeting computer feature that helps a bit, but you lose points the longer you use the targeting computer.Overall, I found portions of this game to be fun, but they need to brighten up the graphics to make it more playable."
2,not what i expected...,"i rented this game with high expectations from the previews i read, but it did not turn out as what i expected it to be. the graphics are good but the gameplay is somewhat boring. all you do is sit in a spaceship and shoot things. i think it would be better with a two-player mode and levels where you are not in your spaceship. i can see why a lot of star wars fans would like this game (hmm...because it is a star wars game, maybe?) but if you are not sure you will like it then i reccomend you RENT IT FIRST."
2,not that great,if you're a star wars fan then the experience may be different for you. But i found this game boring. The graphics are not bad but half the time you have no idea what to do...circleing around space makes me dizzy...
2,The Star Fox games are much better.,This game is so stupid.It took me 3 weeks just to get to the third level.The challenge is too hard for a normal person and the missions are very tedious.I miss straight forward action shooters where the only mission you have to do is shoot other space fighters and beat the boss.That may sound simplistic but done right like in Star Fox its awesome.This game is really dumb.
3,One of the better Star Wars titles....,"It's one of the better Star Wars titles, but that's not saying much. It has sleek graphics, somewhat entertaining gameplay with easy to get used to controlls. If you like Star Wars games then you might want to try this one. Other than that, it's nothing groundbreaking, and if anything, it's more of the same."
4,Fun but VERY hard,The graphics in this game are good game play isn't bad but it is hard to compleate the training and to win the race to Tashie station but other than that it's a prety cool game espicaly with cheats.
4,"Hard, but a great game!","This game is a great game but it is kind of hard. It has great graphics and sound.You can either play as Wedge Antellies or Luke Skywalker. Pretty good combination if you ask me! There are a bunch of unlockable ships so the replay value is great. There are also medals and points you earn at the end of each level on how good you do (bronze,silver,or gold medals) and you can unlock ""secret"" levelswith those points. There are also different views of the ship you are in, such as third person and cockpit views so you feel like you are in the game not just playing it! I would give it five stars but it is pretty hard (which is probably a good thing). Anyway, great game, buy it, you won't regret it."
3,great except for one thing,"This game is nice, the graphics are incredible, and it's got some fun star wars moments. However, there is one thing about this game that I despise. There is no way to turn off the invert look. I cannot play well with those controls, which resulted in me quitting the game before I could finish it. One small thing ruined this game for me and I consider it garbage. I give it 2 stars because of the graphics, sound and overall detail of the game. Too bad the lack of one control option kept it from getting 5 stars."
1,Great Game NOT!,This game s great that is if you have the cheats for it. It is retty much imposssible to beat please save your money and buy a different game!!
4,OK game even if you don`t like star wars.,i don`t like star wars at all but i have this game and it is ok not great but ok i think it is realy hard to pass the levels it isn`t as realistic a combat flight simulator 1 for the pc made years ago. so if you are desprate or are a star wars game look into this game.
1,So........,"Well well everybody who bought a gamcube is so excited because you can finally have a kinda mature game.Hate to break it to you If you bought gameucbe just because of this game you shouldve been smarter. Rogue Squadron is the best game for gamecube no doubt about that but no one paid any attention to the shiny xbox which has a ten times better star wars game Starfighter, so hate to break it to you if you bought gamecube just because of this game well your gonna get mad because overall xbox is the best system (deep inside you know that) and if you bought gamecube becasue of rogue squadron well let me just tell you every single game for xbox is better than rogue whatever and if your looking for a star wars game well xbox has a much better one (starfighter)You feel kinda dumb now huh? You feel like you should have kept your cash and keep on saving for xbox."
4,The other Liz Taylor,"This is a beautifully written examination of the influence of an apparently beautiful and kind protagonist on the people around her. There does not seem to be easy to relate plot, rather the story is character-driven and moves effortlessly from one situation to the next. I really loved the way in which Taylor never really ends a scene between two characters; rather there will be a conclusion or continuance from another character's point of view in a latter scene.It was published in the 1960s and some of the language can seem a little dated, such as the way gay characters are referred to. Yet, it is so refreshing to read an author who knows grammar and syntax; and has such a sharp eye.A modern Bronte or edgy Austen, there need to be more titles available!"
4,Rhythm Carnival,I am really surprise this young man has not been signed to a major record label yet. The music is majestic. I love Rhythm Carnival and Flava. Jazz lovers would love this CD.
5,Yule,I just heard Barbara had a book out. Haven't read it yet but I went to High School with her and she was a crackerjack. Got to be a great read. Hey Barb! Its Yule.
5,An Entertaining Read !,"Freeloaders is a delightful, if incredible, slice of SW Florida life. I thoroughly enjoyed the misadventures of Karen Sinclair, whose only desire was to relax and recharge in FL retirement....if not for all those house guests! This is the perfect book to take poolside or to the beach."
1,Disappointg,This was a short quick read. I did not find the humor the other reviewers talked about. It seemed a collection of events that I could not follow.
2,Not What My Son Was Expecting,We were not pleased with the description nor the games available on the disk.
4,!!!!!!,"It's so great to see people's opinions on this book! Julie Hutslar is my aunt, and I read the book and liked it (esp. the acknowledgments page, where she says that I was the original inspiration for the book) :)By the way, did anybody like the poem ""The Gift"" in the book? My mom wrote it...I think it's amazing!~Maggie"
2,Great Little Madison - no so great a read,"The book is probably great for a junior high assignment. It provides an overview (very high level) of the life of James Madison. Much of the comment is innuendo and author guess work (it seems to me). Not what I was expecting after reading ""A. Lincoln""."
3,Seriously- do not 'call' this a kids book?,"A ""children's book""? Really? This book is to read only if you need something to write a book report about!Granted, this book is written to give an account of the times and tribulations of James Madison, but let's be serious--For a 10 year old? It is wordy and redundant for even this 40+ year old mother. I read 2 chapters aloud to my son and found myself having to stop mid-paragraph to figure out what I was saying more times than not.Review and categorize this book for what it is -- a historical biography. And in the words of my son, ""I'm trying to read it, but I can't get hooked."""
5,the title says it all,"I guess the problem with books about celebrities is that they always have a bias. I mean, writing a book is an enormous undertaking, so for someone to write a book about Barbra they realistically have to love her a lot or hate her a lot. Mr. Cunningham, it seems, neither loves Barbra nor hates her, he writes objectively not for himself, but for the rest of the world who very definitely has an opinion of her. I myself LOVE her. I don't know how to say it, but Mr. Cunningham has certainly helped me. He distilled her life into fewer than 300 pages. I could almost formulate an admiration for her that has taken more than thirty years to create just by reading this book."
5,You will not be able to put down this action packed western.,"John Thorton hears from his long lost love, Marie, who married his brother, Lucky, 9 years previously. Lucky has been murdered and Maria needs Johns help. John hightails it back to Hope Valley to solve the mystery with danger lurking around every corner"
3,"It is OK, but wouldn't buy it again","This stool is really light, so it is easy to push it with the kid standing on it- not good. The lower step is very narrow, so it makes it impossible for a 2-year old to walk down by himself. The design is great. My son loves tractors!"
3,Fun read,"A fun read and insight on Florida of 100 years ago. Loved the dated dialogue that seemed to be well researched (thank goodness, I hate it when 1950s characters say ""Cool, dude.""). Fast paced, nasty villains and clever hero. Some editing problems with name and some text."
4,Suspense,I found this book captivating and intriquing. The story line kept me not wanting to put it down and I even found myself awaking in the night to pick up where I had left off reading.
3,Cheap but adquate holster,"I'd had a Treo holster that broke...expect to replace my phone in a few months and didn't want to spend $25 for a replacement. This holster does the job adequately. Not going to set any style records, but not embarassing, either. Belt clip seems like it will mark my belts a little more than the more expensive one would. And the holster isn't quite as secure--phone has fallen out a few times over the last month I've had it. But I'm satisfied with the purchase: you get what you pay for."
2,Poor design,"I bought 2 clips, one for my wife's 700P and one for my 700wx. The phones are the same size/shape, but the clip appears to be made for a TREO of a different size/shape. The wrap around corners don't fit against the phone, as if the clip is too shallow. It's difficult to get the phone into the clip and ensure it's ""locked"" and difficult to get it out of the clip without dropping the phone. It has even popped out twice on its own in just 2 days of having it. There is a large clip that goes over the top of the phone, but it hits against the memory card in the top and makes the card eject/pop out. I do like that it's a softer plastic/rubber and a shallow clip, but I will be looking for something else."
3,This item is not that great,"If you have a Palm Treo 680 like I do, this item is an alright purchase. The biggest problem I had with this clip is that if you put any pressure on the phone while it is being held in the holster, like getting in or out of car, the phone will pop out the holster. I've only dropped my phone twice and both where while using this holster. For the money your spending its a decent clip because it is so cheap. I no longer use the holster because it broke as I was trying to take it off my belt. I probably won't buy another one. Buy the pouch from Cingular, even though it is huge and ugly, it does the job way better."
2,Maddening!,"This clip broke the moment I pushed the Treo into it. It didn't quite fit, so I pulled it out and tried to realigh it. When I pushed it in again a little harder, the holster broke off of the belt clip. I haven't bothered returning this item. I'm sure they probably have a great return policy and it may have been my dumb luck that I got a bad one. But it just isn't worth the time to go through the motions considering the small pricetag."
5,Excellent recipes for any time of the year,This book has excellent recipes; not just for the holidays but all year round. Love it!! I even ordered some more of Louise Stolzfus' cookbooks
1,Unreliable,"This item is very hard to get off once inserted to hot shoe. The bad thing is even though it is hard to get it out, it is also unreliable as well. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Avoid."
1,buy canon,"I have no issue with cameta but this item is junk. buy canon!!!. it locked onto my 30d and would not release. the pin.spring bent and I had to destroy it to remove it. same thing with opteka flash unit, buy oem , just not even close to canon quality."
1,Poor build quality,I had two significant problems with this cord. It doesn't maintain function when you use a 580exII fully locked on the hot shoe. If you only slide the locking mechanism over halfway you can get the synch function but flash wasn't secure. My first shoot with this cord was a wedding. Halfway through the reception the hotshoe on the cord became loose from the bottom portion where it connects to a flash bracket. Bottom line if you are planning to use a 580exII save your money get canon or another brand. It worked okay with my 430ex but after the bracket connecter started to wobble that rendered it useless.
3,anwering system by Conair,"I like this system, the only thing i would add is something in the system to give me the time a message was left."
2,Disappointed,I bought this for my husband for his birthday because he built a Labyrinth on our property. We were very disappointed with this CD. The songs were mediocre.
2,Run away! Run away!,"I happen to like Sting's pop music. But he should have kept his John Dowland renditions in the shower stall where they belong. Why listen to fine music performed badly when there are plenty of good recordings of the same songs? Why, because this one's performed by Sting! Huzzah!Actually, the lute playing here is quite nice. But as soon as Sting opens his mouth, the spell is broken. Every little thing he does is NOT magic; this album will have music lovers calling the police."
2,who is going to listen to this on a regular basis?,"really... who is going to pop this in the cd player more than once or twice? whether or not you 'respect' the effort or even like being exposed to something new (old!), wouldn't you rather put your money towards cds you're going to want to play over and over again?"
3,It's okay,Not as spectacular as I had hoped. I think picking and choosing a select few from i-tunes would be a better investment.
4,Very nice Baroque style music with a familiar voice,"I thought this was an excellent CD. Of course, I had heard one of the tracks before, on the TV show Studio 60, so I knew what I was in for. I was not consciously aware of Dowloand's music (I'm sure I've heard it without recognizing it) but I know Sting, and I don't quite get the folks who say he's weak on some tracks. He knows his limitations, and he stays within them.The liner notes also provide an interesting background of both the project and Dowland's work.Regardless, if you enjoy this style of fingerpicked, Renaissance-type music, and don't mind that a rock star is trying something new and singing instead of a faceless choir, than I think you will like this CD."
2,Very disappointing,"As we all know, the music of John Dowland is lovely. When played by Paul Odette or Julian Bream it is exquisite. However, this production is almost depressing. Sting's gravelly voice finally grated on me and I probably won't play this again. The lute performance is mediocre also. The best song is that which they use to promote the album. Pass on this one."
3,good effort,"I like Sting. And I like some renaissance music. So - lute plus Sting sounded like a good idea. It is a good idea, but about half of one. Unfortunately the tenor of Stings voice gets weary as the songs go on. Part of the problem is either the original music (though I don't know it) or Stings attempt to read it in a certain way. I like about half the cd...which is not bad. I think it might have been interesting to pair some of these songs with original Sting tunes. Glad to see him stretching, always happy to see an artist keep being an artist. His lute playing is enjoyable, even if pooh-poohed by purists. I'll be making my own mix of some of these songs with other Sting songs."
4,Nouveau Renaissance,"I love Renaissance music, play period music myself & have tried to bring a more hearty and less bloodless feel to it. The people of the time were such lusty folks! That said, Sting's effort to bring these wonderful Dowland songs into the 21st Century is extremely interesting - but not, I would say, for the purist -The lute accompaniment is lovely - & this is on the level of a dream Renaissance Faire...sadly, I can't really make out what he is SAYING in between, even tho I like mixed spoken word in performance - I don't think it works here - but it's a great introduction to Dowland's songs for those who would be put off by the ""classical music"" aura otherwise surrounding them."
5,"This is ""in-line"" with the direction he is going but different for Sting",I throughly enjoy Sting's work. He is head and shoulders above most artists in his line of music. When I first got this CD my wife and I sat down during a quiet moment and really just let it play. We were very pleased with it and it will become one of many that will get played on a Date Night (usually Friday nights for us).....The subject matter is different for him. We're pleased that he is moving on from the main line of works he's done in the past. We're looking forward to more of this....
1,Dude be trippin'!,I am at a complete loss for words. Did we climb into the bottom of a Scotch bottle and decide to wax poetic? Yikes!Life is short. Please leave us some music.
3,Sting?,Not sure about this one.....a little different from his normal works. Maybe it just takes some getting used to.
5,Very Nice 16th Century Music and songs,"It was a nice surprise that Sting performs this music so well. There are three or four pieces of music that, were it not for the Elizabethan language, sound quite contemporary. My favorites are in the first half of the CD, but some of the latter ones are very good. The insertion of original letters from John Dowland give a sense of why certain songs were written and give a time context to the CD. I enjoyed this CD a great deal and have relistened to it often."
4,It grows on you...,"Upon first hearing I wasn't sure I liked this CD, but after the second time, I was hooked! The only thing I'm not sure of is the spoken word sections by Sting. They seem to break the spell a bit, but I understand that Sting is trying to put things in context for us. Despite this, I really love the selections; the lute is fabulous and Sting's interpretations are quite lovely... he is such a romantic, so that they are really befitting of him. My favorite selection is ""Come Again"" and ""Clear or Cloudy"" is nice also. ""In darkness let me dwell"" is a bit dark but an appropriate ending to the disc. This is great listening for an elegant Christmas brunch, save the spoken sections."
1,Disappointing,"Sting is a very talented performer who has made few missteps in a long and successful career. This is a project he never should have taken on. Everything sounds similar on this disc and none of it is of particular interest. It isn't particularly awful, but it is particularly tedious. For a really outstanding take on modern performers tackling music from this period, check out anything by the Mediaeval Baebes."
3,Good try,"I have listened to Sting's latest several times. I myself am a muscian with classical voice training and have sung Dowland's and other Renissance music. Though he dosen't hit the mark on some of the selections, this album represents what every artist should aspire to do-push the envelope of creativity. No, it is not going to gold or platinum or be heard on the Top 40 list, but it is an earnest attempt at not only singing the music, but giving fresh interpretation, something that we classical singers have problems with at times(overemphasis on perfection in recitals. If you ever want to see someone who goes against the grain, see Ian Bostridge). At times I think the voice is mixed too far ahead of the lute, and is restrained when it should not be(Come again), but this album grows on me every time I listen to it. Sting is truly an inspiring artist and I look forward to his next album."
1,"Love Dowland, but Sting ruins it","I love Sting's music, and I love anything to do with Elizabethan England. I thought that this CD would combine the best of both worlds and be something that would utterly enthrall me.Dowland's songs and music are wonderful and the lute is beautiful. However, they are completely ruined by Sting. These songs were meant to be sung by someone with a clear, powerful and melodious voice. Sting's voice is raspy and at times it sounds like he doesn't have enough lung capacity. You can hear his labored breathing at times.I actually felt pained listening to him sounding seemingly in pain. I was so disappointed by this CD. I'm wondering if his voice has really gotten that bad, or if it's always been this way and he's always found a way to hide it."
4,"A lovely, relaxing music alternative","I could do without the bits of Sting reading from the composer's letters, but the lute and vocal music is relaxing, romantic,even sexy, and, it makes a nice background for dinner or a quiet evening. It it weren't that Sting's name is on this, most of us wouldn't be buying this album; to expect a classically-trained voice means that one has bought the wrong CD. This version offers a worthy and pleasing introduction to this Elizabethan music."
2,Keep the lute and lose the vocals,"I've always loved madrigals and was excited about this CD. Sadly, Sting doesn't have a strong and clear enough voice to pull it off. Too many years of rock have damaged his vocal cords or something because he's too scratchy and doesn't have the technique needed to sing these beautiful songs. And someone needed to clean up the lute playing - too many squeaks thoughout the CD. Buy it if you're a collector of Sting's music. Stay away if you love madrigals."
1,This is not the Sting we all know and love,"When I saw that Sting had a new album, I ordered it blindly. I have always liked his music. This one is full of old (400 year old) songs, that have no modern feel. It may grow on me in time, but if I could find my Amazon air bill, I would send this one back."
2,Good F-in' Lute God,"I'm really glad Sting enjoys the Lute and can play, but this isn't the typical Sting album and really is quite challenging listening. . .As in CHALLENGING to remain conscious . . . this'll be great for those suffering insomnia . . . nearly as effective as televised golf."
1,Not for Sting Fans,"If you're thinking of buying this CD because you enjoy Sting's other works don't do it. I'm glad he produced this album at the end of his career and not the begininng, we would have missed a lot of good music.If he's doing this album to explore his artistic talents and not to make money that's fine, but can I have my $13 back?"
3,kudos for trying,"I have to agree with the reviewer who applauded Sting for this effort, and for introducing John Dowland to folks who would otherwise never have heard of him. But I do hope these same folks will then take the trouble to hear these songs performed by a vocalist trained in that period of music. Dowland's music is fabulous; Sting's breathiness is not."
1,A Disaster,"As a fanatic fan of Sting (Rock, Jazz, almost anything he has done) and also Renaissance music I didn't believe my eyes when I saw this collection. What a fantastic idea - or so I thought. The result falls nothing short of a total disaster. Take ""Come Again"", one of the most beautiful Renaissance love songs - Sting's version sounds like a drunk socker fan is trying to sing it, plain horrible. If you like Sting, just forget about this CD. And if you want to explore Renaissance music I suggest you stick with the professionals. For my example ""Come Again"" go for Barbara Bonney's version. Unless your heart is made from stone you will melt away."
2,"Good try, but not for the Dowland enthusiast","Full marks to Sting for making the only worthwhile ""Crossover"" album in the last decade. This is because he is singing such suberb repertoire.Whilst these works do not require an opera singer, they do require a singer with considerable musical skills. Alas, Sting doesn't quite convince me that he has such skills yet, although he imagine that he will greatly improve with time and some lessons. I guess he might consider the songs of Thomas Campion, next? Or maybe he has a friend with a fortepiano, and a Winterreise might be considered?For anyone who has developed a real interest in Dowland's music, please seriously consider the complete recording of Dowland's music by Anthony Rooley's The Consort of Musicke or various recitals of Dowlands songs by Emma Kirkby, James Bowman, Alfred Deller, Paul Agnew, Nigel Rogers (excellent in this field), Steve Rickards or Andreas Scholl."
5,Maturity,"It's a touch of grace. We hear Sting's soul. How beautiful it is. Like if it's the proof of the value of the simple things, the essential. He grows in a higher level each time. A masterpiece.Listening this give me the feeling of being in another place, another time, when everyting was purely simple."
2,great lute. not so great vocals.,"i think Sting is greatly talented, versatile. but he is consistently FLAT on this disc. no it is not the style of singing, as i personally know many singers who do well in this era and style of music. his intonation is just under pitch. the lutest is exceptional. he's THE lutest in the world, actually. ...lastly, why is it categorized under ""modern 20th & 21st century"" here on Amazon? it's DOWLAND for goodness sake."
2,Better things,"Lute music, Elizabethan or Virginal music is so exquisite within its own parameters that any arrangements, improvements or modifications even by the great ones (Sting) may not come up as good as it sounds.the vocal altos and male sopranos that sang these melodies back in the 16th century lose their flavor when a Pop artist gets in there and changes or ""improves"" such compositions. In my opinion Sting should concentrate on what he does best.Imagine for a second if you please, american country music played by Japanese Koto performers. On the other hand you have Winton Marcellus that is TRAINED in classical music and renders perfect interpretations solo or with chamber or quartet musicians.Each category has its own value in itself. One must be trained in such matters before making new versions. If it aint brocken why fix it??I saw this 2 CD album at a local store priced at 25.00 I would not pay 12.00 for it.sorry."
5,Sting -Songs from the Labyrinth,"i was not sure how i would like this cd before it came out, not having any real experience wth this type of music, and being so used to hearing Sting in Pop,Rock and Jazz mode, I love Sting so I decided to give it a chance. Everything this man touches turns to gold. The songs are beautiful and the type of music really grows on you. I find it calming and soothing, a delightful alternative to the usual fare. Sting has brought and obscure 16th century musician into our century, and it has been a pleasure to hear it."
4,Dowland lives,"Being an early music enthusiast, and a lover of Dowland's music, I was pleased to see that a contemporary artist would choose to delve into the past and make this type of a compilation. I was especially surprised by the interspersing of quotations between the pieces which seemed to draw the entire collection into focus. I would recommend it to all who love classical music, lute and/or Dowland."
4,Songs from the Labyrinth by Sting,"The music is very good, we bought it for the lute he plays. We wish that there was less singing, and more pure instrumental music."
3,Songs from the Labyrinth,"A little Dowland goes a long way (as does a little Sting at times). This was a bit more than I cared for at one sitting, but a good synposis of Dowland and maybe an intro to people unfamiliar with his music."
5,A new twist to an old sound,"I purchased this CD because I was enrolled in a music class in college, and it fit perfectly with what we were learning. Sting took songs that are centuries old and made them fit in today's market. It is wonderful!"
1,Not for me,"I was very interested in this CD as I have liked pretty much everything I have heard Sting do. This CD is not the case. As a vocal music teacher and accompanist for singers, I cannot listen to this without criticizing the breathyness and lack of stylistic attention. I think it is great that he has delved into this style and broadened his awareness of music history, but I myself, cannot listen to him singing it. I put this CD on in my car and my 10 year old son said ""this is the worst CD I ever heard, take it off"" I then put it on for my 13 year old daughter and her friend and they laughed and thought it sounded like someone trying too hard to pronounce the words.I do agree with some who say, if this CD brings some listeners to this style of music than that is great."
3,Secret journey.,"As much as I appreciate when an artist stretches his abilities, Sting should have reconsidered his venture into lute music. Instantly unique, but eventually repetitive and unorginal, ""Songs From The Labyrinth"" is something to listen to once and then shelve for the next century. Or perhaps you might slip this into the background during your upcoming winter holiday parties.Sting used to make some compelling contemporary music, but this new release does nothing for his reputation. I'd rather listen to my old Police cds or maybe ""Nothing Like The Sun"". So, ""Songs From The Labyrinth"" is mildly entertaining, but ultimately disappointing."
1,Abomination,"This hurts your ears. If you want to hear the real beauty of this music, try listening to someone who's spent the time and effort to train his voice, and has the talent, to do the music justice, such as Andreas Scholl in ""English Folksongs & Lute Songs"". Sting displays magnificent arrogance in thinking he can apply his nonexistent voice and skills to this music, and Deutsche Grammophon shames itself by trying to cash in on such an ill-conceived project."
1,Songs from tyhe Labyrinth (Music by John Dowland ) Sting,"the disc is in the trash. Sting slurs words - which are important in these songs, not in today's music-.His lack of classical training for this kind of music is much too evident.He attempts to POPularize.It doesn't work!!!"
2,Songs From The Pit,"I had heard one cut performed on television and, based on that favorable impression, bought the CD. A disappointing mistake. Many of the selections are musically deficient and best left lost in the past. And Sting simply lacks the voice quality to carry them off anyway. His throaty, whispered readings between cuts are silly and annoying as well."
3,Not the Sting you probably expect,"I've tried to listen to this three times, but I just can't get into it.I do like what people typically think of as ""classical music"" - Mozart, Handel, Beethoven, Dvorak, etc - but I think this may just be too archaic for my tastes.If you like this style of music, this seems well performed. If you're looking for a ""typical Sting performance"" I'd say you should skip it."
3,Elizabethan Music,"This is the audio component of an hour long video made by Sting on the work of Elizabethan composer John Dowland. (The video does adds greatly to the value as it places the music against the background and age (16th C) for which it was written.) Sting's voice is light tenor and right for these poems set to music about everlasting human concerns that persist to our day. But you'll not see those wonderful lutes that accompany the words, so complex to play with a beauty of sound not heard today. Between his music Sting gives an excellent spoken commentary to complete an attractive presentation of esoteric classical music with a modern undertone."
1,"He should change his name to ""Scat""","This is simply embarrassing. Sting has recently taken to passing himself off as a classical musician, playing guitar and lute and singing. He can do none of these above the amateur student level. Only someone with an incredible lack of taste and a huge ego would attempt such a musical endeavor for anyone beyond his own edification. But then to place it on a disc and ask people to pay money for it just bursts the bounds of meretriciousness. He should have stuck to the same tired old reworkings of the one modal folk-new-age-trash song that he has based his solo career upon. And he should change his name to ""Scat,"" for this more closely identifies with the brown, odoriferous material on this album."
2,Tedious,"This plodding chamber music requires a lot of attention, and I gave it my full attention when I first listened to it. I wondered whether this was some famous story that Sting was telling; it sounded as if it was about a real person or based upon someone's letters, perhaps incorporating songs of its day. It gets tedious and repetitive, though, with the regular, labored strumming and the high chanting of the songs, interspersed with deep, almost-Goth recitations of what sound like ancient texts, so it is not appropriate dinner music, for example. It's not peaceful or relaxing. It's tiresome and requires the listener to participate in it fully every time. If you're looking for a romantic mental exercise rather than a musical interlude, buy it."
1,"Kidding, right?","You've got to be kidding me. The emperor has no clothes! I dont care if people rate this review as unhelpful, I really do not see the attraction in or to this 'voice'. It falls short. Same of the 'deep bass' moments sound like a drunk striving, the rest is scratchy and as a selection of 17th century song unquote blind random selection might have worked better. Does Sting think he is a male equivalent of Nora Jones?"
4,"Great music, but save the dramatic readings","I loved the MUSIC on this CD, but could do without Sting's dramatic reading of John Dowland's letters between some of the songs. The music itself is contemplative, rich and magical."
4,I like it a lot!,"Forgive the simplistic title for my review, but it sums up my feelings on this release exactly. I know very little about classical music and even less about Elizabethan lutes. I am a rock and roll guy: always have been and always will be. I have no prior opinions on which to draw as I listen to this one, so making any literate comments on it is beyond me. I can say that I like it a lot. I can also say that I now want to hear more music like this. I like the mood this CD evokes and think it will sound even better in the right setting(darkening wintery skies above, the brush of snow on the window: yep, that's about right!). I appreciate the reviews here that guide the way to other recordings of this sort of music. I feel suitably inspired to learn more about captivating music like this."
2,Oh Dear,"I am entirely at home with Dowland and similar music. I like Sting as the frontman of the Police and in his solo albums. But he can't do this style of song justice - his voice is too coarse and (I hate to say it) flat for these songs. Buy them if you are a Sting fan, but if you really want to hear Elizabethan lute and voice, there are many interpretations that will please rather better."
4,A pleasant departure for Sting,"Ok, so the first thing you have to understand is that this is not typical Sting. He is stepping out of the box, both musically and historically. Once you get past that and understand the music for what it is, you will appreciate that it is a good collection. This music was from the time of Queen Elizabeth I, so when you're listening to it, think of the movie with Gwenyth Paltrow or the Showtime series The Tudors...it makes more sense."
4,ok but needs improvement,Well its ok. Its to easy I want it harder. I would rather get Matt Hoffmans pro bmx 2 than this sorry but im giving it 4 stars
3,No Tony Hawk but best BMX game.,"Dave Mirra is an okay game but it's the best of all the BMX games. But Tony Hawk is so much cooler with the phenominal game play that is rarely found in video games. The awkward objectives don't help boost the score either. The graphics are jaw-dropping but I've seen better for Tony Hawk 3. The extreme sports genre is getting out of control but Tony Hawk keeps it's cool. Dave Mirra's BMX saga is doomed, period."
2,if you dont care about moving load screens get it,this game is bad because you are warned about the level boundaries right when you are about to go out of the level and when you do go out of the level what you were doing is erased. and the starting screen shakes when loading. don't get it it makes you sick to your stomach.
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"THE PRODUCT IT SELF IS FINE, BUT THE DESCRIPTION IN AMAZON SAYS THAT IT GIVES TEMPERATURES IN FARENHEIT AND CELSIUS. AND THAT IS NOT CORRECT. SINCE I LIVE IN MEXICO I NEED THE TEMPERATURE IN CELSIUS. I HAD TO RETURN THIS ITEM. IF AMAZON WOULD JUST CORRECT THIS ISSUE, I WOULD'NT WAISTE TIME RETURNING THE ITEM AND WOULD NOT BUY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE"
3,"Functional, but crapped the bed after a year.","This item will tell you the temperature and a few other bells and whistles, but I don't use the extras. It works fine, I just feel like I could have paid less for what I was looking for, which was really just the temperature inside and out."
2,Less than what you pay for,"Positives: it seems to be moderately well-calibrated.Negatives: the wall mounting for the station is ridiculously inadequate--one screw that it swings from. Also, if you have to change batteries, it's a 25 minute process (2 waiting periods of 10 and 15 minutes). I've already had to do this 3 times in the first day: once to get the thing started, once when signal was lost, and once when I brushed against the station and it fell to the floor. At least it didn't break. I *think* that's a good thing."
2,Wrong statement,"Its a good product but doesn't show the temperature in Celsius as written in the description. That's bad because here in Brazil, Celsius is the standard."
1,Not as advertised,Delivered on time. Nice unit but no temperature readings in Celsius. I specificaly bought this unit because they advertised this capability.
1,Don't Buy It If You Want Additional Sensors!,"I want a weather station with 3 remote sensors: Outside, pool and hot tub. I bought a Lacrosse 8035 and it does NOT support additional sensors as advertised. I returned it to Amazon for refund and ordered this unit, advertised as supporting 3 additional sensors. It also does NOT work with anything but the one outside sensor provided. This unit, unfortunately, came from Builder Depst, through Amazon. Builder Depot will NOT refund my $100 because this unit has been discontinued!!I have emailed Lacrosse for help, but don't have much hope. I feel that I have been DUPED by Amazon, Builder Depot and Lacrosse by FALSE advertising. BEWARE if you buy anything from the above!!!"
4,Outdoor Thermometer,"The thermometer was easy to set up, seems to give accurate indoor and outdoor temperatures as well as weather forecasting based upon barometric pressures."
4,If you're a fundamentalist Christian you won't like it,"I enjoyed this book very much. I happen to agree with the basic premises Bawer introduces, although at times his frustration is a little too evident. It is not as much of a scholarly work as ""A Place at the Table"", but Bawer does include many quotes and anecdotes which add considerable weight to his assertions. I found Bawer's splitting Christians into two camps, ""Legalistic"" and ""Non-Legalistic"" a bit too simplistic (he admits this), but it is useful to make his point. His point is, in my opinion, that in pursuing a legalistic or fundamentalist approach to the Bible, legalistic Christians are missing the biggest Christian teaching of all: love. If you are sympathetic to Bawer's views, you will probably agree with much of the book. If you are a fundamentalist/legalistic Christian, this book will probably be added to your list of ""banned"" books, and you won't enjoy reading it."
1,This Agenda is Opposed to Christianity,I chose this book knowing nothing about the author. The only positive thing I can say is that it took almost two weeks to read. The slowness was due to my disgust of the pronouncements made about those of faith who believe in the Bible and the Apostles' Creed/Nicean Creed. I prayed over almost every page. This author has a distinct agenda. Only those who believe that the Christ is not the Son of God could appreciate this book.
2,On not becoming what you hate,"This promising text, is in the end, an unfortunate example of just what it tries to resist: a demonization of the ""enemy"" as ""un-Christian."" Sadly, this tract will become gospel for those who haven't taken the time to get to know fundamentalists as individuals, rather than as a composite monster. As an author of two books on scripture and an avid-anti-fundamentalist, I fear that this book will simply draw sharper lines between ""us"" and ""them,"" when it could have become an exercise in compassion."
4,"Good book, but faulty printing and binding","I was very much in sympathy with the message of this book, but was disappointed when I got to page 182 and found that there was evidently another book's text that been inserted that had nothing to do with Stealing Jesus. It appeared to be pages from a novel or short story, and on page 197 was a short story by Dorothy Erdman! The Bawer text following page 182 is nowhere to be found. I would suggest that if you buy this book, you make sure you have a copy without this flaw."
4,Interesting and Thought-provoking,"I found the book Stealing Jesus to be one of the clearest explanations of fundamentalism I have ever seen. I like, and agree with, his descriptions of the Church of Love and Church of Law. I found, however, his depiction of the Catholic Church (of which I am an active member) as a part of the Church of Law to be somewhat inaccurate. I agree that historically what the author said would be true but presently, my understanding is that the Episcopalian and Catholic Churches are very similar and I find his treatment of the differences to be somewhat oversimplified."
1,Clearly the author is filled with hate and bitterness.,"The author is very bitter over the fundamentalist stance on homosexuality. He is the one filled with hate not the christians he obviously despises. He wants to take the parts of the bible he agrees with, and discredits the parts that condemn his life style. A bunch of manure is what I call this book. Don't waste time or money reading it."
1,"the author, Bruce Bawer, would rather have you buy ""While Europe Slept""","The writer of this book has found the real threat to gays and lesbians: radical Islam.Really, what have Right Wing Christians ever done? Nothing. The NEA has more political power than Christians.The Muslim aim is to take over the world and exterminate ""infidels"". That's us. That all of us. The Christian right wing can't even stop graphic sex education at their local schools. They are not a threat. Heck, Christians are not a serious worry. They are not a worry.Do not buy this book. It's obsolete. The author, Bruce Bawer, says it's obsolete. We can't ignore Islam. Why? All GLBT people will be eliminated by Islam. That is a face.Read Bruce Bawer's book ""While Europe Slept."" We may actually want to be friends with Christians. Why? Islam means to destroy us all!All good feminists should be worried."
1,A critique of Christianity by a Non-Christian,"Only someone who has never seen the inside of a Bible could buy into this hogwash. The Bible claims, in no uncertain terms, to be the Revealed Word of God. Either believe that truth or don't. If the Bible is corrupted with lies, we should throw it out. (It isn't) If it IS the Word of God (It is) we should humble ourselves and read it with reverance. This book is part and parcel of today's pathetic attempts by liberals to define God down to their level."
2,Disguised Hatred in a book claiming to Promote Love,"Bawer's book, Stealing Jesus, is simplistic, self-serving, and self-contradictory. Allegedly lauding Christian love, his book is a hate-tract against the body of New Testament evidence in favor of a creedal emphasis. His starting point is the bogus absolute truth that being gay is good, from there he strings together distortions of both Gospel and Epistle records, and proceeds to selectively and unfairly bash Christian orthodoxy. United Church of Christ minister, Dr. John Gilmore, Cincinnati, OH"
3,"Thought-provoking, yet hints of hypocrisy","Bawer's book is very thought-provoking. My problem with it is that he equates every one that believes in Biblical inerrancy to be a legalist. He says, and I paraphrase, ""Biblical scholars now say that the letter to the Ephesians was not written by Paul."" Bawer makes it seem as though every scholar now agrees with that point, and that anyone who doesn't is locked in the 'old school' of thought. I do agree with a lot of the points he makes regarding today's high-profile Christian ""celebrities"" (my emphasis), but it does seem as if he got really angry one weekend and wrote a book while pulling three consecutive all-nighters. My advice: Read this book, like all others, through the lens of discernment, then talk about it with others."
4,This Book helped reconnect my Spiritual life.,"Bruce meanders in this book, but his major theme, the fact that the Church and more importantly, CHRIST, has been hi-jacked but fundamentalists, really helped me proudly again call myself a CHRISTIAN. Not the best written, but a watershed in the battle for ""whose"" Jesus you hear about"
2,God=both merciful and just:Can the law and love not coexist?,"Although Bawer's prose is commendable, his content unfortunately, brings me back to the original question he was being asked - Are you a Christian?The basic precept of a Christian is that God is both just (He commands us to obey Him) and merciful (He loves us enough to make the provision by which we Can obey Him. Praise Jesus Christ our Lord).Bawer misses the concept that Christ did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it. Hence, to divide Christians into the Church of Law and the Church of Love, is unfair and unknowing. True, individuals exhibit clear manifestations of black and white attitudes, as Bawer describes. But he also shows that he clearly is one of the individuals about which he writes, while a whole society of followers of Jesus Christ exist with the understanding that our God is both - 1)our Creator and law giver and 2)our provider and redeemer, forgiving and loving us as truly only God can."
1,"Legalism is wrong, yes, but so is immorality.","Although Bawer makes a strong case against fundamentalism, which is easy to agree with, given the similarities between the legalists of Jesus' time and Christian extremists, Bawer muddies the waters with his stray, gay agenda, which he does not and cannot substantiate based on scripture.It is true that legalists defy Grace by their condemnations and such; however, anyone who calls himself or herself a Christian and who is not fully submitted to the authority of Christ's Word and Spirit in their own lives is also denying Grace. (ROM 12:1-2)In other words, fundamentalists cannot prove their own righteousness by criticizing and judging gays anymore than gays can prove theirs by judging fundamentalists for their unrighteousness."
4,Testimony of a Former Fundamentalist,"Speaking as a former fundamentalist, and a ""born again"" Christian for 25 years, I believe Mr. Bawer if right on. I am no longer a member of a fundamentalist church, or any mainstream church for that matter, because I refuse to put God in the box that the fundamentalists do, and I refuse to accept all their dogma. I must say that human beings in general tend to see the world through whatever system of thought they have been taught,and it takes a courageous and creative person to see through it to the truth outside the box. One does not have to understand or accept everything Mr. Bawer says to agree that fundamentalism is not the ""religion"" of Jesus, it is not healthy or kind, it does not even make sense. This is coming from someone who spent 25 years studying it from the inside, and in the end saw the futility of believing that way. I recommend the book. Even though you might not agree with everything, there is something valuable here for everyone to consider."
3,A Caveat to Catholics,"The author does an excellent job of describing how Fundamentalists ""steal"" Jesus and make him theirs and theirs alone. However, Catholic Christians should be warned that Bawer's representation of their faith, ironically, manifests the same sort of ignorance and narrow-mindedness that one encounters among Fundamentalists. He provides several examples of interactions with Catholic Christians from his youth--most of them severely negative. He also misrepresents the Catholic Faith's teachings on Works by describing them as actions committed for the purpose of winning ""Divine Brownie Points""!!! This sort of talk would be worthy of any anti-Catholic Fundamentalist, and it is a shame that Bawer--an advocate of liberal tolerance--cannot liberate himself from his own dangerous stereotypes and misconceptions about the Catholic faith."
1,A gross misrepresentation of Christian fundamentalists.,"The author generalizes all fundamentalists into one uneducated, unloving group, and does not base his beliefs on the entire Word of God, but rather on those Scriptures that he can remove from context to justify his distorted view of the Bible, the Biblical Christ, and of the true, living God that has been revealed in the Scriptures."
1,This book led me to invent a new book rating system.,"What an irritating book.Between the whining and the contortionist-rationalising, the author has made three points, but it's only from sheer masochistic delight that I managed to keep reading it.I think I've written objections on all but 2 of the book's pages. I've also read about 7 other books between chapters of Stealing Jesus.I may also have discovered a new book-avoidance-rating based on the number of bite-marks I left on the outside cover."
3,"It's a playable game, but it's nowhere near Madden.","When I first heard that this game was coming to Gamecube, I thought to myself, ""Wow. Another horrible attempt at a football game by Acclaim? I'll pass."" As we all know, the QB Club games on N64 were very forgetable. I must say that now that I have played this version, Acclaim is on the right track, but it does have along way to go before it can compete in the class of Madden and the NFL2K series. The graphics are dissapointing for a Gamecube game. It looks like this game could have been done on Playstion One. Another thing I didn't like was when you are doing running plays, the game slows down for some odd reason while handing the ball off. It got on my nerves after awhile. QB challenge is good though. Like I said before, Acclaim is headed in the right direction, but it still has it work cut out for them. Maybe if they take the time to fix everything that was wrong with this version, QB Club 2003 can be a winner. This game is definatley a rental."
2,Cowboy Junkies: Radio 1 Sessions,"This is the first Cowboy Junkies disc that I've ever been disappointed with. While I frequently like leaner versions of previously released music, I found the quality of both the performance and recording (or mastering) of every cut to be vastly superior on their OTHER discs. At the beginning of of cut 9 (Common disaster), they even chat about the fact that Margo Timmins has a cold, so it's no surprise that her voice isn't nearly as good as usual."
4,takes multiple listens,"one thing that i notice right away is that it lacks the luciousness the other albums do but thats not a bad thing. it had different sounds, more mixing, not as full. im glad they are making music and hope to see them on their tour. come to louisville ky!"
5,An excellent Variety of Country Music,This CD just blows my mind away. I love every single one of these songs. It ranges from country rocking Little Texas to the best of Dwight Yoakam and Lila McCann. This CD just can't get any better. This is a must buy for any of you country fans out there.
4,Very good country music!,"This is a really good compilation, I love it!!! It's all good country music..."
5,Audiobook is fantastic!,"Katherine Kellgren's performance as Jacky Faber, the heroine of this tale of high adventure, is a narration tour de force. Mary Burkey at Audiobooker named the sequel to this title, ""Blue Tattoo,"" one of Audiobooker's Choice: Great Youth Audiobooks of 2008. It also earned a 2008 Odyssey Award Honor. Kellgren joins Jim Dale, and Nathaniel Parker in the pantheon of youth audiobook readers.Meyer's story is a sort of Oliver Twist meets Charlotte Doyle meets Horatio Hornblower.In order to survive starvation as an orphan on the mean streets of London, Mary Faber becomes ""Jacky"" and signs on to the crew of HMS Dolphin as a ships' boy. She thrives as part of the Royal Navy. Standing fast under fire and as part of a boarding party, she earns the title Bloody Jack. She must keep her sex a secret but that becomes harder with each passing day.Listen to this book if you can."
3,"Good, but caution for under 15","Very good book, nice historical and nautical details, very good use of voice. Caution with younger kids though, due to themes of pedophilia and a couple somewhat graphic scenes related to that. I also wonder how girls like this book - it's really a boy's adventure story with a tomboy as the main character. When her feminity emerges, there is a strong suggestion that this is her weaker side..."
4,"Great book, it gets better","It's a great book, great characters and story, there was a bit near the end that was hard for me to swallow, but it gets better in the next two books, so it is worth reading for the introduction to great characters and a great story.I don't think this is good for 13 year olds no.. but the library had it under young adult which is like 15/16 and up."
3,review,"It was a good book, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. If you're looking for a book that is all about pirates this is not the book for you. I thought that Bloody Jack would have been about a mean, tuff pirate. Instead, it was about a girl who wasn't a pirate at all."
1,"TItanic, pirate style.","This is a nice little story about a girl who disguses herself as a boy. How very orthodox. I didn't especially like it, but then again maybe you will. They focus on her obsession with her bunk mate a little too much, instead of kicking pirate butt, which was what I expected from the summary. It was pretty predictable, but it gave you a little ""haha"" once or twice. The writing itself was ok, but as I am not learned in british slang from the 1680s, it was a little difficult to understand what the protagonist ment. It was a book I could put down and forget about until i stepped on it. I read it, and would suggest this book for girls. It may seem like a ""boys"" book from the cover, something like Stowaway, but a boy might not enjoy reading it. It was no Da Vinci code, and was about 8 levels down from the writing quality of Harry Potter, but if you really have nothing to do, check a book out from the library and keep this one on the shelf."
4,Good Entry in Naval Historical Fiction---A a First with Girl Part,"I like British navy historical fiction, and this is a fine young adult version of the genre. Wonderfully suitable for boys and girls, the likeable hero(ine) is admirable, clever and brave, and also distinctly female even in boy guise. It takes a little while for the story to set sail (so to speak) and it stalls in irons at points with romance concerns, but my son and I will both look forward to listening to the next book in the series. (As many other reviews note, the series has an excellent narrator)."
4,Fast Read,"This was a fast, fun read. I thought the author did a good job of keeping this reader's attention. It seemed the author did quite a lot of research on the time period as well. I felt like I was living in history while reading it. I would recommend it to any reader."
3,Nice,I like what these guys do and appreciate it but this ain't their best album. Indeed a few songs are quite good.
4,Great way to see the best of Utah in a non-tourist fashion.,"This book caught my eye as I was browsing through travel guides in preparation for my week-long trip through Arizona and Utah. Tired of fighting hordes of tourists from every corner of the globe, I wanted to get the flavor and feel of that part of the country without being hassled by the mobs. Every place I went, from the quirky hotels in Moab to the awe-inspiring day-long treks through Canyonlands, was inspired by the guide. Brewer has a keen eye for the off-kilter, and I hope to follow his slightly beaten path in other parts of the country as well."
2,Horrible picture quality,"I wish I had waited to see reviews instead of pre-ordering the 3D Blu Ray version. As others have stated a good portion of the movie is incredibly grainy as if there was a defect when manufacturing the disc. I'm not sure why they even released it. The quality is that bad. The 3D effect is pretty good for a conversion but still, it is almost unwatchable especially the first 10 minutes which gets you thinking I must have a defective copy...?"
3,Life in the old Ash yet - to the tune of 2 or 3 stars,"So what are we expecting here - histrionic excess? Well not exactly. This perfunctory live album in front of an appreciative and probably respectably aged crowd pulls out a bunch of faves. Though recorded in '92 much of this record harks back to a time 20 years prior. The King Will Come, Throw Down the Sword and Blowin' Free all from 1972's Argus album all sound sparkling here. Beefed up a touch these are truly timeless peices of rock 'n' roll.Ash fans should loo at the track listing before buying. After all it depends on what era of Ash floats your boat. And it is only one disc when their gig must of gone much longer. With only eleven tracks the value isn't high and your not getting any insight into this mob and so the casual fan can probably miss this one without feeling terribly deprived. Then again it could be a decent intro to this gentle rock 'n' roll institute.Two or three stars depending on your mood."
5,Truly Emotional... A Triumph!,"The desperation of the main character in this story is so true and powerful that it indeed feels like you are living through it, and for me it was like living through a nightmare. Buy this book."
3,Why no DVD?,"Strangely enough, the words ""Book-DVD-Online Certification"" led me to believe a DVD was included with the book. The associated DVD is sold separately, making the book/DVD combo cost more than $50."
2,Better than nothing,"If I lived near the ocean and was primarily interested in kiteboarding on the ocean, this would be an OK book. However, since I live in MN and am primarily interested in snow-kiting, it is of limited relevance."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This title of this DVD is MOTO X. There is no motocycles in this DVD whatsoever. Even the cover art is a motorcycle. Extremely dissapointed !!!! We were under the impression that we were getting a motocross style stunt DVD...we got a a BMX, skateboard DVD and poor quality at that."
5,Good Meditations for Personal Power,"Invoke the Goddess in You! I love this book and the meditations and visualizations in it.It is a magickal workbook with lots of info on Hindu, Egyptian and Greek goddesses.If you like this book, they're alsoInvoke The Gods: Exploring the Power of Male Archetypes"
3,Good cross reference if used with other books.,Although there the meditations and background are useful the writing style is somewhat presumptuous.
4,Good book on basic visualizations,This book is good for one to understand the goddess and design working with goddess which is not bad i wish more goddess was list but still a good book over all just wish it was bigger
2,Trobe needs to do a bit more research,"I really wanted to like this book, and for the mostpart there were some good sections on traditional ""Western"" Goddesses, However, Ms. Trobe did an horrific job on the Egyptian section. While she is correct in some of her conclusions of the similarities of the Egyptian Goddess, Sekhmet and the Hindu goddess Durga, she really lost me on some of what she was saying. Sekhmet does not suck souls, and She is not a goddess that has ""....an insidious evil lurking behind her eyes"". If that were the case, then why include Sekhmet at all?The Egyptian section of this book is very superficial and very wrong from an historical and magickal point of view. Please take it with a very large grain of salt."
4,The Great Waltz,I throughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any one who enjoys good music. The plot was entertaining and you were hoping that his wife would win out in the end. A good way to spend a couple of hours.
5,Timeless,"Movie goers from China and Taiwan through out generations adore this masterpiece. My parents at ages of 92 and 84 respectively saw the movie in China during the war with Japan. China delclared war with Japan in 1937 during World War II long before US did. Japan then blocked entire coastal line in China to cut off any supply from the sea. In the hardship of war US supplied China with necessities through air cargos and land delieveries including movies.Shortly before 1949 Chinese Communists took control of China, my parents fled to US protected Taiwan and got married. My siblings and I saw the movie several times in two decades before coming to US. Personally I had not see the movie again since the arrival in US in 1986 until 1997. I moved from Utica to Poughkeepsie in 1989 and moved again to New Jersey in 1992 ever since. I found the movie in VHS form at a vintage store in Dover. I watched the movie over and over with different views and feelings."
3,"It's o.k., but much cheaper now...","...I've rented it...and played it. I wouldn't spend 50 bucks on it. .... One of the most annoying things that kept me from rushing to get it was the fact that only one track is open to you when you begin, and it takes a lot of practice to get good enough to finish in time to open the next track. Gran Turismo gave players a few different track options, at least. The tracks I've seen on Acclaim's website for Extreme G3 look great...if only they were easier to get to..."
3,Not very good,"The concept here was good, but poorly executed. I have played a lot of games on the GameCube, and usually I resign myself to playing games that have great critical reviews. This title I picked up as a budget title, and after a week, I sold it. It is fun as a rental, but save your money for other purchases. So far, Nintendo's own F-Zero franchise looks to be heading in a similar gameplay direction as this game. I only hope that F-Zero for the GameCube turns out better than this."
4,"Really Good, Really Exaggerated","This game does not make sense. I GOT IT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND IT IS VERY FUN, BUT HOW CAN MOTERCYCLES GO IN EXCESS OF 600 MPH?mE AND MY FRIENDS PLAY IT ALL THE TIME AND WHEN YOU DO A RACE BY YOURSELF, YOU ARE ALONE FOR THE WHOLE TIME BECAUSE WITH TWELVE RACERS ON A HUGE TRACK ARE RACING EACH OTHER, IT'S HARD TO BE NEAR THE OTHER RACERS. I ADMIT THAT THIS IS A GAME AFTER ALL BUT AKKLAIM DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE IT THIS FAR. The graphics are very well designed and I am a very good rider now. some bikes make it feel that you are flying.It is a very good game for the cube but not perfect...Game Master Jason"
4,Pretty Good,This game is pretty good. the graphics and sound effects are nice.this game gets u pumped.The gamecube version is much better than the Ps2. I recommend this for ages 6-up.this is also a must have so get urs today
2,Nope.,"I didn't like this game. PS2 has it's Wipeout Fusion, Xbox has it's Quantum Redshift, and Gamecube has this. This game dosen't compare to the other systems. It basicaly is a very mediocre futuristic racing title. I suggest you stay away."
2,I don't know about this one....,"I don't quite know about this one. It's cool......you shoot people to pass them, it never works for me. Not really ""Exteme"" G 3 Racing, more like wha?! G Racing to me.Since all you ""REALLY"" do is well....""TURN"" for example. There is hardly any drops,twists,super sharp turns that kind of thing. I used a cheat code to get all the tracks, I played all of the levels, after that I didn't play anymore. It's really boring. I thought to myself ""Wow, you know that game is so fun I'll have to play it again next year"",but the reason I gave it a two is because of multi-player mode. I think you should rent this before you purchase it. Then you will see what I mean."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Just rented G3 and it's about the most boring game I ever played. The cycles are lame, the weapons are lame, and the enviroment is anything but interesting. Save your money, rent first buy later..."
2,chrome lid rack,"This chrome lid rack is a nice heavy weight and would be great if used for trays and tray type pans. However, it is advertized as a lid rack organizer also and i purchased it for this purpose. The problem is that the space between the racks gets smaller as it goes toward the front. My pots and pans (and i have checked others) even though the circumferance gets smaller, the handle on the lid stays the same size and height. This means that the smaller lids do not fit down into the organizer. If it were made the same width at each rack space it would be great"
3,Works best for medium sized lids,This is a nice sturdy product that does what it's supposed to but because the dividers are all the same height smaller lids either slip under the divider or perch on top and eventually roll off. It fits larger lids fairly well but my problem is a lack of overhead space so standing the very large lids on end makes them too tall to fit below the next shelf up. It works perfectly for my medium sized lids even though they have mismatching handles. It doesn't have any type of gripping surface on the bottom so it does slide a bit if you push on it.
3,And the winner is...,"Though I feel Craig won the debate, I don't think this should be the point of the book. Dialogue between Christians and non-Christians for several reasons needs to be the issue. I thought the book was good, and I was overwhelmed by the kinds of knowledge philosophers (must) know. I'll acknowledge that I'm a beginner in philosophy, and all my training pertains to theology and church history. Still, though I could embrace the majority of the book, I think its arguments--comprehensible in themselves--need elucidation that can be understood in a clearer and more succinct way. I did enjoy the book."
3,Smells very good,My husband received these soaps for Christmas and he loves them. The smell is a littlestrong in the bath but it slowly dissappears. The scent doesn't linger.
3,electric michelangelo,The hype about the book is too much.Subject is fine but words and sentences used are difficult to follow and take the pleasure out of reading
3,Overcast skies in coastal towns,"If you like Dickensian writing, then this will be a good read for you. Fascinating story, though dark. Meticulously written. I found myself slogging through this novel with some unresolved plot around Riley Eliot, Cy's mentor and Renna Parks, his mother and with Grace. It is a book to be read slowly and savored with a pint. There are gaps in the timeline...time at war, recovering from wounds, and Cy reminiscing on unstated sinister deeds."
1,Another Gamecube rip off,This game is just a re-release of the crazy taxi for sega dreamcast. If u ask me just t pay $20 for the dreamcast version or get crazy taxi 2. Another get rich scheme for gamecube. They are just trying to make it look like gamecube has good teen games. This look like another N64. The only improvement is the graphics
2,Big NO NO!,"When I first heard of this game,I thought I'd like it.But boy was I wrong!I played Simpsons Road Rage for PS2,and I totally loved it.Then I heard that this was even better,so I got it.It is the worst game ever!There is no point to the game,no hidden characters,no new levels,NOTHING!The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's only useful if you just want to use it to get high scores,other than that,this game stinks!"
1,annoyed,"I ordered the game July 13th and not only did it take a whole week just to process, but it took till July 27th just to get here. I like the game, its great. Its fun to have a game that I always used to play on those arcade consoles but I just wish it hadn't taken forever to get here, it was after all supposed to be a birthday present and it ended up arriving waaay after the party"
4,"Great game, but not for this price.","I love this game, but if you pay the $50 they want for it here, you'll be disappointed. I got it for $20 months ago. I've seen it for $12 new at some places. Look around, it's worth it."
3,I dunno...,"I like this game, it can be fun, but I found it got old FAST. There's just a couple of tracks and the gameplay is always the same with little to open up, what you see is what you get. I disliked how you have to perform the special moves, it should be more easy. The music in this first game is pretty good, well-suited, you'll get tired of it though, and driving without music isn't fun. I start to get sick of it after 10 minutes. The Dreamcast version is cheaper."
5,old but good.,this is a old game yes but if you are like me and you are just now getting a consol that will handle crazy taxi this is a must have.
4,Some of us did miss this game the first time,"Crazy Taxi is a whole lot of fun, and if you never bought a Dreamcast--as many of us didn't, including me--this is your chance to own the best arcade racer in years, with slightly improved graphics. What I like best about it is that it's oldschool arcade-style play: there's no end and no goal, except to rack up the highest score (the most money) that you possibly can. If you're a fan of wild arcade-style racing, don't hesitate to buy this game!"
1,"Actually I'm not a ""true"" gamer & found this game tedious.","I actually purchased the system as a present for my brother, but until I get it to him for X-Mas I've been going to my local video store and renting games <hee hee hee>. I rented this on a 5 day rental plan, and I returned it early because I was bored with it quickly. And as I said, I'm not a gamer, so that might say a lot, as the lack of additional cities and drivers, and car options made me bored quite quickly. And what was the point with the license?? No indication if the player receives any extras for earning a top notch license.Loved Rogue Squadron, Super Monkey Ball, and Wave Race, as all of these were quite challenging and kept me captivated. So much so, that I almost returned them late. My suggestion is to simply do what I did - rent it, and save your money for a game that will keep your attention for a longer period of time."
2,Definite rental...,"I played Crazy Taxi for the first time on Dreamcast, and liked it, so I bought it on GameCube. Big mistake. The game is a 'one time' game, and only fun for a very short amount of time. It is worth renting, but not buying. There is no plot or story line, pretty much no point at all. All you do is pick guys up and get payed insane amounts of money. Who wants to play a cabbie video game!?!?!? Waste of [money]. Spend it on a real game like Metroid Prime or Super Smash Bros. Don't make the same mistake I did..."
2,A fun game that gets old too quickly,"Anyone who hasn't played this game should rent it, play it, return it, and be done with it. Crazy Taxi is one of Sega's more successful franchises, yet it's one of it's weakest. Go figure."
1,This game suuuuuuuuuuuuucked,Do not bye this game! Terrible comprared to Simpsons Road Rage. Got bored of It the Day I got it. This game is not worth a damn penny. i gave this game one star for a reason and would of given it zero stars if I had the chance to. I can't say one good thing about this game.DO NOT GET IT!
3,Let your friend get it,The point of the game is to drive a taxi. well thats fun. I say tell your friend with a gamecube to get it. then you wont get bored.super monkey ball is also a bad game. it sucks super monkeys balls
1,The game has no point,"I bought crazy taxi cause the reviews said that it was good. Crazy taxi has no point in the game, there is no story nothing to do but pick up guys and take their money. I reccemond you do not buy this game cause it [tinks] I gave it 1 star cause the day i bought the game i hated it."
2,Crazy Taxi,Don't let its cover fool you. Crazy Taxi is an ok game. There are only 2 levels to drive in. The game gets boring after you play it so many times. The graphices are pretty good but could be better. This game is not for smaller children some people shout obscenities at you if you are late to drop them off. It is a bad game for Gamecube. I bought it and now I hardy ever play it (...) There are mini games to they stink too. Spend your money on a good game like Super Smash Bros. Melee or SSX Tricky.
1,This game suuuuuuuuuuuuucked,Worst Game I Have ever played. Terrible Next to Simpsons Road Rage! Isn't worth a damn penny. I gave this game one star for a reason and if the chance came by I would have given it 2 stars.DO NOT BYE THIS GAME!!!...Hellooooooo This Is Mr. Luxemburgh is Charles There
4,Fun but short,Hey All you gamers. Well.. I have the game and it was LOADS OF FUN! only problem is that after a day. you can beat the game. Its hilarious when your with your friends. if your friends know how to share. Its a one player game. Anyways. Awesome game but short
1,This game is boring.,"This game is awsome when you play it for the first time. Then, after a couple of hours you are bored. THere are no objectives or any thing. It has no plot, it doen't even have much of a point. All you can do is pick people up in a taxi and take them some where. It's just another cruddy Allcliam game."
2,"Fun game, but disappointing content","I bought Crazy Taxi because I loved playing it in the arcade. I wasn't disappointed in the gameplay. This isn't my primary game, but fun to play every so often for a while.However, I'm really disappointed in the language for this game. Mine came with a well-deserved Teen rating. There was no need for that type of language in the game. This game would otherwise be perfectly suitable and fun for my kindergarten-aged son to play, but the language makes me want to throw the game away."
1,Awful!,"After playing this on my Gamecube, I would have to say that this is awful! Do not buy it! Yeh, When crazy taxi came out for arcade, it was a HIT! And, I admit it, I was one ok the people thrilled that It can out for the Dreamcast. But I have to say that this game is BORING!!! It is good for about 30 minutes... but then It just gets old! You don't do ANYTHING! Picking people up and droiping them off, even with all the crazyness of driving how you want gets real boring, real fast. My advice to anyone is not to spend [money] on this peace of [junk]! Don't even rent it... Just back away... slowly..."
5,Great game!,"Crazy taxi is a very fun game. It can get frustrating at times, but ussually not. The graphics still look like their from 1998 but the game runs smoothly. Note: Their is alternate ""versions"" of the game. YOu can use a bike, or you can play each level, but in a different starting place and the people are in different places..."
2,DONT GET THIS GAME,"this game is just plain terrible. at first its a pretty fun agme but after a while it gets boring, theres not even a goal to reach . i suggest u get the simsons road rage which has a goal and is a much better gamen then this pathetic game"
5,Dont mind the bad reviews,I just recently baught this game is it rocks!!!Dont mind the crappy reviews.Its just because its older.But realy old games are good! only an idiot wouldnt like old games. I think the flaw is that theres nothing to unlock or objectives. if you like bargins and great games. get it!If you like running destoying stuff and jumping in car gamesget it!o yea its got good music and funny voice oversP.S
3,"Not a ""How to Play"" Book - More of a Coaching Book","I was disappointed with this book, and actually sent it back. This book is targeted at coaches, not at someone who wants to learn how to play basketball (rules, terminology, scoring, positions, etc)."
5,great CD,This band is great! This is their first full length album and it was worth the wait! I have to be carefull while listening and driving because it makes me want to go fast!
4,Great khakis,"I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was thinking when he ordered these... These are khakis made my the Lee Jeans company, these are NOT jeans, don't be confused. I really like these pants, and as a big guy it is often difficult for me to find comfortable pants. These fit very well, and are very comfortable for me, and at under 20 bucks I highly recommend them."
3,An average pair of pants - good price.,"In large sizes these pants have a very long rise (distance from crotch to waist). On me this causes them to hang very low in the crotch. My wife is having to do a major renovation to the two pairs that I have. Also, the weight and durability of the fabric seems to be less than I expected. These are, after all, jeans and should be made of denim or heavy twill."
4,crkt self sharpening pocket knife,For the price it is an OK knife.1. It has a very strong spring on opening.2. self sharpening mechanism is very well hidden.3. steel in blade is kinda soft. nicks easily.What do you want for $14.00. I will carry it till?
3,Great Idea! Needs work,"It was a great idea, but bad execution. This is what I consider a novelty knife. point blank."
4,"Ala Tool,adventures and misadventures in Saudi Arabia","As a woman who also lived in Saudi Arabia I could easily relate to her adventures and various encounters with the people of this mysterious country. An enjoyable and informative read. For a different perspective I would also recommend ""Single in Saudi"" by Genia, a single woman's story of life in Saudi."
2,Ugh!!,"This book starts out giving a clear picture on some things but soon falters, leaving the reader confused. My professor is using this textbook and I don't understand a great deal of what I'm learning. If you don't know ANYTHING about theory or you haven't been taught this stuff ever, DON'T buy this book-- it's a waste of your time."
4,Very Nice TV,"I bought this TV way back in Dec 05 and 9 months on it still working great.When I first got the TV out of the box the picture wasnt very good,but after playing around the picture control for a while I finaly got the TV looking great(Well great for me any way) HD of course looks the best on this TV and yeah DVD's look great too.Right now I have a Blu-Ray player and a HD DVD player hooked to it and the picture is awsome,cant wait to check out Superman Returns in High Def!Make sure if you get a Blu-Ray player or a HD DVD player to set the player to 1080i for best picture.My only gripe with the TV as I do have one dead pixel on the screen,but you have to be looking for it to see it.Well anyway this is a very nice TV and I give it 2 thumbs up."
4,The TV is a great deal,"Just got this TV and I think it is a great value for what you pay. I think all in all, it is one of the best 32"" LCD sets out on the market today.Things to keep in mind, it is widescreen, so it looks a little stretched with a regular cable imput. Have had to change the mode and it makes the viewing area smaller, but clearer.The remote is a little clunky/ugly in my opinion, but it works fine.I think overall this TV is a good deal and you will enjoy it."
2,Samsung LCD TV LN-R328W - more a PC monitor than TV,I was impressed by picture quality on that TV and by great integration capabilities (input ports). I had it for 2 months and I started to notice dark spots on the LCD panel. I made about 20 calls to attempt fixing it under warranty just to hear them blame it on me or shipping for the physical damage. I used to be a big fan of Samsung but their products just need to be more reliable - I also had trouble with a Samsung washer not so long ago. Also pay attention to low quality of plastics used - the TV is very shaky on the provided stand - I would recommend a wall mount. Sound quality is so bad I would call this model a monitor. In fact it does look like a big PC monitor and not like a TV set. Nice speaker set is a must even for occasional music listeners as me.My rating is 2 just because it has picture quality I loved so much. Otherwise it is a worst buy I've ever made.
3,HDMI port failure,"I've had this TV for about 2 years. Picture quality has been fair compared to my Plasma TV. Tonight, following minimal manipulation of the HDMI cable, the HDMI port failed. Examining the port, it is clear that there is not enough support for the cable to prevent cable movement damaging the HDMI port. In my opinion, this is clearly a design flaw."
2,Samsung LN-R328W HDMI port failure,"I have purchased 2 LN-R328W units at the same time and had both wall mounted by the seller, Best Buy. At approximately 16 months BOTH units developed the same problem. The HDMI ports failed, apparently becoming loose inside the unit, thereby making a good HDMI connection impossible. Since the units were more than twelve months old, after many calls, Samsung decided to do nothing to help with the problem other than suggest I pay for the repairs. They do not recognize this as a design defect. This is a fair warning on two points: 1) After 12 months, you may receive NO HELP from Samsung. If you want your product to function and be supported longer, you may want to consider another brand; 2) At least based on my experience, this model seems to have a propensity to have HDMI port failures. (See other such reports on Internet sites)."
2,"Great picture, malfunctioning sound.","The picture on this TV was excellent even on non-HDTV channels. However, after two days of use, the sound went out and came back multiple times. It appears that the speakers were excessively sensitive to humidity in the room. I eventually returned the TV because of this. This may be a single defective item, but it deterred me from exchanging it for another."
3,Bought an AOC instead....love it!,"Not one problem with my AOC monitor. Loooove it! I cannot rate this without buying it, so the rating is not accurate. But I did look at it. Decided on the AOC."
5,A bike riders' Bible! The best rides in Massachusetts.,"Over the last 15 years, my friend and I have enjoyed pedaling along Howard Stone's routes throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island. He chooses the most scenic, historic, and friendly areas; he always has the bicycler in mind when he gives directions. I have always wanted to thank him and his staff for many fabulous hours of biking pleasure."
4,"Good Rides, Poor Syntax","I've been using this book for several years. The rides are consistently well thought out with regards to safety, accessibility, scenic interest and level of difficulty. However, you are going to have to re-write the directions for yourself in a way that isn't completely incomprehensible. Side notes and points of interest are fine, but a cue sheet needs to be clean and clear. The author separates street names, turn directions and distances over several lines, often putting the end position first, or worse, never even gives a street name amongst the muddle.This book in conjunction with your mapping website or GPS is a great resource for novice and intermediate riders."
3,Not for the beginner.,"I'm just beginning to draw and this book doesn't offer much in the form of directions. It is an awesome book, but if you are just learning this book is to advanced. I will put it on a shelf for now and save it for future use."
3,The art of pncil drawing,"It's a very interesting book especially for skilled people using pencil. Few words,many drawings. You can found suggestions about subjects to and how to draw them concisely."
2,didn't work so great in NJ,Unfortunately all the channels they provide have some broadcasting in my area and the sound sounds like a weak muffled FM station. Glad it works for others but doesn't work for me.
4,Work's Well!,Work's as good as Irock Player. It's a good price for a quality product. Make sure you follow the directions about how to Tune in the channels and all. It's worth the buy.
1,"fingers, keep walking!","Cheap, shoddy plastic. Turned on once, got only static and hiss. Turned on a 2nd time - nothing. The thing ""worked"" for less than 3 minutes.Item's worth LESS than you'd pay for it w/ the shipping fees. And it's rather hard to return. Keep looking."
1,Not happy with this product,Channels they provide have some broadcasting in my area and the sound sounds like a weak muffled FM station. And night you can just not think about. wish i read the reviews before I got this one. KEEP YOUR MONEY. berdell Chicago.
4,simple elegance,"Please disregard my previous review. I was actually referring to my most recent purchase last December '06, which was a ladies Skagen wristwatch. Sorry for the confusion."
2,0 for 2,"I have purchased two of these watches over the last six months. I had the first watch for two months and then noticed a crack across the entire face. Although I don't recall doing anything to cause the crack, I decided to chalk it up to an accidental bump. I purchased the second watch six weeks ago and it was cracked within a week. This time, I am absolutely positive that I did nothing to cause the crack. I wore the watch to and from work (desk job), and did nothing strenous while wearing it. At this point, I don't want a repair or a replacement. This specific watch has been a huge disappointment after having had other Skagens that performed beautifully."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this a few years back. After a few months of use, the glass is full of scratches. Then the battery died after a year. I have a few other watches and non has looked as horrible on the glass. Very disappointed I have been avoiding skagen since."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I was not aware that this book is nothing but blank pages. I didn't read the whole book description, or else I would not have wasted the 8 bucks! I just thought I would share this piece of information with others so they wont make the same mistake I did.If I don't return it, I suppose it would make a good journal.I also can't believe some corporation is making tons of money publishing ""books"" that no one has to write!"
3,meh,"I bought this book thinking it would help me further my knowledge of the game. As a recent fan it seemed like there was still a lot I needed to learn even though I had been watching football all my life with my dad I never really paid attention until recently (8 years or so). I started looking for a book that would help me expand my knowledge, this wasn't the book. I did learn a few things, but it was mostly about historic games and statistics. I think it is a good book for a person just starting to watch the game, but too basic for someone that's been watching a while. I gave it to my mom because even though she's been watching for the 34 years she's been with my dad she's still usually a play or two behind."
5,Unbeliveable,Amazon.com is amazing! I actually sang in the Choir that is recorded here! We sang for the Pope and it changed our lives overnight. I never thought that I would come across this recording EVER again. especially since leaving Mexico to come live in the US. The recording shows the emotion and the love that the people of Mexico felt. I highly recommend it!
4,Good buy for the money,"Pros: Good size, light (titanium). Fit and finish is good as well. Overall, very good purchase for the money.Cons: Luminous material on hands and hour markers is really weak. Borderline non-existent."
4,It's Totally Kitty,"I have various kitty things on a key chain and this is my latest addition. It was too adorable to pass up. It arrived quickly, as pictured. Only concern I'll have will be over the ""kitty crossing"" dangle. I fear it may end up in the bottom of my purse one of these days because it's thin and attached only by a single unwelded loop. Otherwise, it's just adorable."
5,Great for applying Rudiments to the Drum Kit,"This DVD is not for anyone who hasn't learnt their Rudiments yet. It is for Intermediate to Advanced players. Once you learn the stickings & feel for the Rudiments at speed this DVD will show you some cool ways to apply them to the Drum Kit, making it a fun way to get away from thinking that Rudiments are just for the Practice Pad & boring. If only I had this DVD years ago. However as Todd suggests he is just showing you some variations of some of the Rudiments, you should then think of any & every way to come up with your own variations moving Accents different time feels/meters etc. Todd is a funny person & a good teacher. I can easily see how it won Modern Drummer 2009 Readers Poll. In my opinion you can't go wrong buying this DVD."
3,English Cottages,"The book is well presented but it disappointed in being exterior views of mainly very expensive elitist cottages - and that seems to be stretching the idea of a cottage as many are large houses. Also disappointing is the lack of interiors.It was an expensive exercise having this book sent to New Zealand, and I've learned to be wary of buying any book on line now without first checking it out at the local library.The book is in excellent condition so I'll likely on-sell it now.Judy"
4,Buy it! It's great!,"This will be short but sweet. About a week ago I bought the single Temperamental and was blown away (although I should not be surprised). The music was instantly catchy and the lyrics were just so haunting. The song just reminded me of many a nite out at the clubs and that lonely feeling you can sometimes get when it's all over. It just touched me instantly. Anyway, I have purchased the full C.D. and it is just as great. There is not one filler song on the entire thing. Every song is better than the one before. It exposes you to what is new and exciting in music today and doesn't forget to give you a great song to sing to also. I just love it. It is so rare these days to buy a C.D. that doesn't instantly insult you. To the old fans that still want them to sing the ""strum, strum"" stuff, give them and yourself a break and step into the new millenium with the rest of us! Tracey and Ben's spirit is very much in these new sounds. Buy this, buy this, buy this!!!"
3,close...but no cigar...,"I really miss EBTG's earlier jazz/pop stuff. This CD is not bad, and Tracey's voice is not buried under the dance-track junk, and some of the lyrics are quite good, but it's not classic EBTG!"
3,"Ben is rolling in it, Tracey needs more edge/challenge","At last another cd- have listened through once. First listening to the original stuff 15 years ago, I am a die hard fan and love the chance to hear where things are going musically with the band. Ben's spinning skills and ear for the a new sound keep things interesting. As lovely as Tracey's voice and lyrics are, they are too safe for me. Not nearly tragic, edgey, and racey enough to keep my attention."
2,Everything But the Girl simply honoring a contract?,"I was very disappointed with this latest CD. I have been fan of the band since they first formed. Obviously there has been a departure from the more folk music sound of the past, however, the newer sound is great. It's just that this particular CD is repetitive. I felt as if the band was simply honoring a contract obligation."
2,repetitive and boring,"in comparison to EBTG's previous albums of this genre (Walking Wounded) this CD is blaaah. It has repetitive dance beats and is no fun to listen to unless you're at a rave. The vocals are drown out by the drum machines, etc. which really was a let down. Overall, an average put out by EBTG. I wish I would've spend the extra $4 and gotten something else new. ( I picked it up used) If you like techno, club-ish kind of music, go for Massive Attack, or maybe Fatboy Slim, or EBTG's previous releases."
5,Awesome!,Love it. every song is great. Get this one. it rocks. it owns. it's amazing. I play it back to back to back to back daily.
4,An enjoyable pop album that has its own original flair,"TEMPERAMENTAL is the first album that I have bought from Everything But The Girl. I heard their track ""Temperamental"" on Deep Dish's RENAISSANCE: IBIZA mix and fell head over heels for Tracey Thorn's impassioned vocals, so I rushed out and bought the album.I was quite satisfied. Tracey Thorn's voice never falters over the entire hour of the CD. The drum beats are engaging (especially on ""Hatfield 1980"" and ""Low Tide of the Night""). This disc has a classy sexiness to it that is lacking from so much of modern dance music. The lyrics are original and heartfelt, and present a wonderful contrast to the filler in the bulk of mainstream music.Other reviewers of the album have lamented EBTG's move into dance music, but for those of us who wouldn't have been drawn to their former jazzy style, TEMPERAMENTAL offers a chance to see what EBTG is all about. Now I can work my way backwards in their repertoire and like what I hear."
3,"A letdown, but not a big one...","Walking Wounded was a remarkable turnaround for this band. This album's sound is slightly dated, but Tracey's vocals can humanize even the most mechanical music. For newbies, start with Walking Wounded."
2,"OK, KIND OF BLASE...WATERDOWN VERSION OF PAST SONGS.","First this CD is okay, not horrible, just okay. The best song on the CD is the title cut ""Temperamental""....How ""Five Fathoms"" topped the club play on billboard I will never know....Otherwise this CD is just a waterdown version of ""Walking Wounded"", ""Missing"", etc....I say, EBTG go back to your roots....remember ""Driving""?....I am tired of Tracey's vocals being washed out by synthesizers and dance beats...Just because they had the biggest hit of their careers with the No. 2 Hot 100 chart topper ""Missing"", someone at their label tells them to keep coming out with dance mish mash......A disappointment."
4,EBTG ... Re-discovered,"When i bought this album 5 years back, it was because of TT & her wonderful presence on Massive Attack's Protection ... I was not into House/Chill-out at that time ... I listened to it Today after 5 years, wondering as to why did I not give this album a 2nd listen ...This is a great album with great production by Ben ... I have become an admirer of Mr. Watt's versatile production prowess ... This guy knows how to mix block busting House anthems with fantastic chill out grooves to create an Overall superior Album ...So, after 5 years - I Discover one of my favourite all time albums ..."
5,Regret never sounded this good,"Only EBTG can make sad songs that you can--nay, MUST--shake your booty too. Check out ""Temperamental"", with Tracey Thorn in full-on, throaty falsetto. Then there's ""The Future of the Future,"" which may be the house anthem of the Millenium. And, of course, plenty of slow, moody ballads with crazy bpm...I love this album!"
2,What a dissapointment.,"Being that I am but a casual fan of this duet, I thought that buying this album would be a good idea. I was wrong, and I was out 13 bucks. This entire disc suffers from a malaise that I just couldn't appreciate, or get over. I usually enjoy trance, and all things considered drone. However this album seems uninspired, asleep, and unimaginative. Fast forwarding through the tracks will bare no fruit for you either. It would probably be best to steer clear of the CD all together."
1,this one is a let down,"I don't know why ebtg has bothered to put track separations on this disk. It all sounds the same, like something a teenager would record himself with a drum machine. Generally good lyrics, though.This cd is far from the best work they've done."
1,Shockingly bad,"I have all of EBTG's albums, I've got Tracey Thorn's ""Marine Girls"" album, I've got Ben Watt's solo album. I could never have believed that they could do anything this bad, but here it is.Every song sounds the same - an annoying monotonous beat and little else. I can't even imagine why anyone would enjoy listening to this."
2,repeating themselves,"i was so glad when first heard of ""walking wounded"",what a sucessful revolution they've taken,i thought. & all the songs from ""walking w.""are touching & tracy's unique vocal has so fitted the music,just like portishead. unfortunately,ETBG seems to lcome to an dead end in ""temperamental"",i can't rememver a single song after finlished listening. maybe it's time they changed their style again. b.t.w.i also like the acidjazz/country sound of ETBG in those old days."
2,Bland,"Think about this: a rather dull but likeable three-minute pop song. Unmemorable lyrics, repetative melody, but a charming voice and some neat instrumentals. Now, extend that dull song to six-minutes, strip away the instrumentation, slap on a repetitive beat and try your best to drain the life out of those oh-so-nice vocals: that's ""Temperamental"". The music is same-old EBTG, but with a lot more pretense. I suppose if you just want to dance this album will suit you fine. But if you like strong melodies, and mayhaps some intelligent lyrics to accompany the music - pass this one by."
2,Disappointing!,"As much as I love the duo, this album just isn't very good. The only plus on this CD is the track ""Lullaby of Clubland"", which is a smooth and hip listen. Otherwise, I long for the old time stuff!!"
4,Longtime fan pleased,"I've been a fan since 1984 and I LOVE the direction they are going. ""Idlewild"" ""Acoustic"" and ""Amplified Heart"" are definite faves, but I think they have wisely gone in a direction that has caught many off-guard. And it's just incredible music. I think ""Walking Wounded"" is a bit more creative than ""Temperamental"", but this newer pup is also one I'll be listening to over and over."
4,EBTG's Electronica daze...,"Ben Watts long-time tinkerings with drum machines and synths have finally come to ""Tempermental"". A 10 song CD with a complex plate of electronica. From the first seconds, listeners become accutely aware this is not the EBTG they know. Instead, 4/4 beats thump into an off-beat harmony along with the sweet voice of Tracey Thorn. ""Five Fantoms"", ""Blame"", and ""Tempermental"" are the outstandings of this CD. They will amaze the senses with its smooth production and silky-smooth vocals. The rest sounds too similar to early Swing Out Sister.Listeners familiar with EBTG will love the ""Tempermental"": Which might have been named ""Experimental"". Good music!"
5,"After a classic ""walking wounded"" they ones again succeed",What can I say. A perfect mix of the brittish quality pop that has its roots in experimental dancemusic. Yet they manage to keep it together and create a record that will last for years in sound and arrangements.
2,Not the EBTG I used to know,"A far cry from Language of Life and Amplified Heart, I feel they've really gone downhill bringing back the disco beat. The EBTG I used to know had beautiful ballads that made you think about life. This and Walking Wounded was a huge disappointment for me. If you like disco, that drumbeat that bang bang bangs, then this is for you... i personally think they're headed for disaster."
5,"Now, it's time to dance","No more quiet, acoustic, downtempo beats from ebtg, this cd is all about hitting that dancefloor. You have house influences, drum n' bass, and just a great vibe overall from this cd. Notable tracks:blamefive fathomslullaby of clublandtemperamentalthe future the futureno difference - downtempo track - excellent!These songs I think are certainly the best of the bunch on this cd that make that house party just sound that much better! You've got to give this cd a listen in addition to their other cd's and pay attention to how they've progressed with the times nicely for the music that they create. Truly beautiful music."
2,I wish I had listen to the reviews and saved my money.,"I absolutely love this group, and I loved ""Missing"" -- playing it over and over. Little did I know that when I was hoping for more of the same in this album...that I was better off still playing ""Missing"" over and over and over and over. Enough dance beats to get even a fan annoyed. I miss her voice too."
4,Muy bueno,What a great EBTG album! The perfect companion in the Internet Age...provides the energy to work in a promising idea...even inside a concrete laboratory in a sunny weekend day in the Summer season...BUY.
4,Ben and Tracey are back :))))))))),"Temperamental is the latest offering from Everything But the Girl (EBTG) aka Ben Watt and Tracey Thorn. This record has so many great tracks and once again we have that nice deep house sound as well as jungle influences -collaborations with Deep Dish and J Majik, respectively.I really liked this album, there is something about EBTG's style. Another thumping house groove is the title track ""Temperamental"". You just can't help but move to this.However, with all this said and done ... my favourite little gem on this is ""Blame"" co-written by the very talented Metalhead - J Majik. This track has hard kick slappin' drums, jazz elements and is topped off with Tracey's sweet voice ..."
5,Canon ET-65B Lens Hood for EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS USM Lens,"Works as designed, performs well with intended lens, construction is plastic though."
2,Very disappointed with this hood,"I bought this canon hood, which cost me 40 dollars, and it is loose and lets light in the back. It shakes on the lens as I carry it around. Even though it does what it is intended to do, of all the Canon hoods I have this is the biggest rip off for the cost."
4,Canon ET-65B Lens Hood for EF 70-300mm,Fits the lens and why wouldn't it. It's a Canon product. Too bad Canon doesn't include the hood when you buy the lens????????
3,Over priced,"Does what it's supposed to but way over priced. I was just cleaning out my old gear and looked at a Minolta lens hood, it's metal (aluminum?) and light, it's solid and probably costs less than 50% of what Canon's asking for. And why does it have to be so big? I guess Canon is trying to make you feel better that you are getting a big lens hood for your money."
2,expensive lens hood,"This lens hood is a good product for which it is intended. It should cost half as much as it does, it was $40.00 and to me that is way over priced."
3,Are you Kidding me?,"I bought this hood when it was at its lowest for around thirty dollars. Then I saw it rise to forty. Now It's listed here for a hundred bucks. are you serious? Has the world gone nuts? its a lens hood made of plastic. I will say it works fine as a lens hood, but then again it isn't that complicated. I say just get one of the replica ones unless you can find this for a much lower price somewhere."
5,Canon hood lens,"The item was very nice but it didn't fit so I had to sent it back, and everthing went very smooth."
5,Canon Lens Hood for the Rebel XT,Canon ET-65B Lens Hood for EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS and DO IS USM LensesSeems a little pricey until you see it up close and personel. The secure attachment and the finish ensure that it is worth the money.
5,Useful,"Overpriced? Sure.Useful? Of course, and in several ways. On a recent vacanza a Italia, the hood proved its worth not only as an excellent flare mitigator, but protected the front elements from damage (and I generally consider my gear babied) made possible by careless other tourists. Of course, the hood was a necessity during lengthy evening/night exposures, as well, in heavily traveled areas (Spanish Steps) because of the large doses of light provided streetlamps.A slotted hood might ultimately provide better flare oblation across the entire zoom range, but this hood does its job.For those who wonder, the hood works with both the DO and non-DO 70-300mm lenses.For the record, I won't drop the star rating because of an excessive price. Protect your kit - and your exposure plane: use a hood."
5,You get what you pay for!,"I blush to admit it, but...I ordered a ""cheap-o"" hood first. What a mistake! It was a real pain to put on and take off. No matter how careful I was I felt like my lens gears were going to strip with every on/off operation. This OFFICIAL Canon version is perfect! Easy on and easy off. Plus it just feels better. Quality is quality every time. This is the hood to get! FYI: The ""cheap-o"" hood return was quick and simple. Amazon rocks!"
3,Overpriced but what choice do you have,"You really need a lens hood for the EF 70-300mm lens if you are shooting in strong sunlight as the lens is prone to sunspots. Beside the fact that this hood makes it look like you are wielding a bazooka it does the job is is meant to well. I can not tell you this is good value, $40 for a cheap bit of plastic is an amazing rip off. If you can find one manufactured by another company go for it, otherwise suck it up -- there is nothing you can do."
3,You seldom get what you pay for,"The name is impressive, but the clock is plastic. It has a big face, easily read from a distance, but doesn't do anything a less expensive clock would do. It uses a usually available AAA battery, but it does use it up fairly quickly if you use the light and alarm features much."
4,Useful during power outage,"We recently spent almost two weeks without electricity - had never used this before, but it certainly came in handy during the emergency. It isn't lit continuously, so the battery lasts a long time -but if you touch the large button you get light for a moment . The display is large enough that I could read it without my glasses, and the snooze button does work - I used it as a timer for my eye drops.It seems well made, and the case is sleek and compact."
3,Nice display buttons too small,Bought this for my husband for travel. Loves the display but the buttons to set this are too small and not easily displayed
1,No quality control,"Loved the size, look and layout of this alarm when I received it. Too bad it didn't work!! Some of the spaces on the digital screen would not light up. Back it went. Thank you Amazon for making the return easy."
1,A piece of junk,This item is the worst piece of junk I have bought in a long time. I bought it for the alarm which would not work from the very start and additionally some of the numbers would only display as half (or less) characters which made them unreadable. The clock was never used and will be disposed of in the garbage dump as that is where it belongs. I refuse to invest anything more in this item by paying to have it shipped back to the company for repairs.
2,Didn't work for me,"I painted my apartment for the first time this week and sought out any tool that would make my experience easier. Given how popular Shur Line's edging tool is (I liked the edger quite a bit), I had thought that this corner painter tool would be equally useful, but ended up being somewhat disappointed. The result was varied at best, sometimes it worked, but most of the time it left streaky paint marks, and I ended up ditching it and using a brush (which was both quick and effective). Perhaps I was not experienced enough as to how best to use the corner painter, but then again I just wanted a simple, easy to use, and effective tool, and this unfortunately was not one."
2,Not great,I have the Shur-Line Edger and the corner piece. I wanted to paint all the rooms in my new home and had no experience painting so I got everything I could think of to do the trick. The edger is my favorite. Just buy that and a roller with a 3-pack of sponges and a paint tray and any size brush and you will be all set. The edger attached to a broom handle. The corner unit did nothing. It didn't even get into the corner. The edger did a better job. Save your money.
3,Not as good as I had hoped,I have used other Shur-line products for edging and thought this would be another great tool.Over all I'm just not happy with it. It does not always seem to be able to reach into the corner and hit both side surfaces.
2,Don't get this version,"I bought this game to have my favorite classic on the go but man was it a waste of money. The past releases of this game on gamecube, genesis, Wii, etc. worked fine but when it came to the advance it had serious slowdown bug issues and even the music was a bit different and sounded horrible. The game is great but not for the advance. Get it for another system."
3,"Finally on GBA, but...","When I heard that this game was going to be released for the Game Boy Advance, I was very excited. I had been waiting since 2001 for the release of Genesis games on Game Boy. I collect all of the Sonic The Hedgehog games and I have been a huge fan since 1991. When I purchased this game, I was disappointed. The graphics are similar to the original version, but is rather too slow. Sonic games are supposed to push the limits on the game consoles by how fast he is, instead the ame has slowed way down. I do recall slow moments on the Genesis, but those didn't seem to bother at the time, actually they still don't. I am guessing it has to do with the memory ram, the genesis had 64 kb of ram while Game Boy Advance has 32. If haven't played this game ever, then I recomend it, otherwise it is not worth having in your collection."
1,What hapened?,"What happened to the origanal Sonic the Hedgehog? i'll tell you, it went straight to hell.ok, it's been said many times, but i'm gonna say it again:::Game moves Slowly.Music is messed up.not a challange, spin dash was added. ((genesis version was harder because it was made without this))nop notch graphics? yeah right! hahah.the only thing good about this game is that a save feature was added.other than that it's nothing like the origanal.buy this game on any other system BESIDES the GBA.Sonic Mega Collection has this game on it. it's great, save 10 bucks and buy that game instead. plus, that game comes with sonic the hedgehog 1, 2, 3, sonic and knuckles, sonic 3d blast and more.way better deal."
2,Games freezes,My son Loves the sonic game controller that we plug into the tv so I got him this to play on his ds. I loved sonic as a child but when i tried to play the game it wasnt responding to my commands and frooze alot which made me die all the time. its annoying and almost unplayable.
2,Why do i need a title?,"I love sonic the hedgehog and everything. I used to play the original Sega Genesis one, but this game just doesn't feel like a sonic game. It's graphics are really choppy and lags frequently. I give Nintendo props for finally porting it to a handheld but i recommend that if you want the first sonic game, buy the one for gamecube or maybe the DS one."
1,Oh How the Mighty Have Fallen,"I think this game cannot be called a Sonic The Hedgehog game. It's more like a Slowy the Slug-guy game.What the the heck were they thinking when they made this? Sonic had a good history on the portable systems,but this I think has destroyed his reputation. The game itself is..... okay but it was redesigned for the Gameboy and the frame rate was slowed so that moving Sonic is like moving a slug. The music was also changed so that it only has the basic themes of the original. BLECH!!! Skip this one and stick to the original."
1,wow,"I cant believe they somehow messed up a port of one of the greatest games ever. really this is terrible the glitches are so bad i cant get past the second level and I,ve had the game for over a year. green hill is fun but its nearly impossible to get past the second. the game doesn't even know whats going on some times. Im serious its bad, Ive gotten killed and crushed by absolutely nothing, thats right i wasn't even standing by anything then all of a sudden sonic just dies. stay away from this at all costs, if you want a fun portable sonic game try sonic advance 3."
1,what a disgrace to sonic,"sonic genesis is a god awful piece of somthing! if it's not the glitches killing you, it' somthing else. the collision detection is bad, the slow frame rate's worse, and to top it off, the game music is INSANE! the music is so awful to listen to, it makes you want to rip you ear drums out! it makes me cry knowing this is based off the genesis oringinal. this is celebrating the original game's 15th annaversary? wow sega, you must hate sonic. i can't believe you're tring to con people out of their hard earned money for this insult! and what's worse, you're tring to pass this off as the original? WTF?!"
3,Needs improvement,"This manual is much better than the Hayne's version; however, it still requires some improvement in the details. A huge improvement could be made by separating this book into several different publications covering fewer model years."
4,Two really good songs at least,"So far I've only listened to the two songs that led me to buy the album. They are good enough to buy an album for in my opinion. Conventional Wisdom, and Going Against Your Mind."
3,trim the songs back 50% next time,"I'm a fan, have all their cds. While I enjoy most of the songs on this cd, most of them are just too long. I find myself moving on about half way through each song. They take ""jam session"" to a whole new level. Strongest songs for me are #4 and #6."
2,It has already been Built,"I have to say that this was the album I most anticipated this year. I'm a BTS fan and have every BTS album. When people ask which is my favorite, I always reply: the one in my CD player now (which could be any). This album lacks the ingenuity of albums past and falls short of my expectations. I'm not sure if it is a case where BTS couldn't live up to my expectations and I'll rediscover this album under a different setting and love it but for now, it's getting locking it up."
5,Delightful,"I am a big fan of devotional Hindu music, and this CD is just an excellent example of upbeat and catchy Indian music. The tempos are lively and fun. If you enjoy this kind of music, then this CD shouldn't disappoint."
2,"Bland, Unorganized","I made a too-light decision to use this text for an informal logic part of an Introduction to Philosophy class. I thought, ""Aren't all informal logic texts basically the same?"" I hope that they aren't, because then they would all be like this one. There is no coherent organizational scheme. There are chapters with titles like ""Incorrect Inference"" -- which is to say, fallacies, which is the alleged topic of the entire book, and hence can hardly be set aside from the rest of the book. The lists of bad uses and fallacies are run together more or less at random. Some of the examples of fallacies aren't examples of fallacies, but the sort of thing that looks sort of like a fallacy but isn't. The examples are, in almost every case, wooden and unbelievable. And the writing is bland and dull. I regret the choice of text and can fairly strongly recommend that others avoid it."
2,Nonsense is Right,"Nonsense:Do you understand what people are saying when they are communicating to you? In this book, Nonsense: Red Herrings, Straw Men and Scared Cows: How we abuse Logic in our Everyday Language, Robert J. Gula isolates some of the more commonly used fallicies within the English rhetoric that lead audiences to be mislead.Gula does a good job of teaching the reader to be more critical. He writes, ""They may confuse what (appears) to be relevant."" However, there are parts in the text where the writer contradicts his own statements. Gula's consistently moving back and forth between being objective and subjective. More specifically, he pushes his own ideas on to the general examples that he uses.This entire book is filled with elementary examples that are suitable for the ninth grade level at best.DMPLJWLZ"
1,Boring boo full of cliches,This book is horrible. I learned nothing. The only points that were reasonable were those that everyone already knows. Useless and pretentious.
4,Nonsense,"People always talking nonsense but lots of time I can not point my finger to what being said was wrong or twisted, that's why I try to find out and read this book.This book is easy to understand event for the beginner like me. ( I did studied mathematical logic but not Philosophy).Recommend for any one like to have conversation or debate with friend or family."
4,Interesting read,I bought this book for a college critical writing class. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect but it turned out to be very good.
3,OK,"I can see how this a very useful introduction to logical fallacies for the undergraduate, but somehow I was expecting more verve and insight."
3,"Superb, makes you long for more","The best introduction to logical thinking. So captivating it makes you want to dig into the mathematical aspects of ligical thinking. It helps you "" see through"" the fallacies of others and ... ... your own."
1,Dry Dry Dry,"If you are a hardcore ""geek"" type where you love programming and books with a dry technical nature then this is for you. If you're like the rest of us, you'll have to move on from this. I'm using this in my Java class and it's just got me lost because it's pretty boring and I'm a visual learner. My background is web design but moving my way into development and programming. I have done some programming and when it's laid out to me properly, I don't have any problems. However, when it's very boring and ""just there"" then there are problems. I purchased ""Head First Java"" and even though I'm only part way in, page 40, I'm gotten more out of it than the class has given me. Not to mention my teacher is dry so that's a lose lose combination. I had to go beyond that class and class' book to get the information I need!"
1,Battery Operating Time,"Hi,I would like to purchase a battery for my camera Panasonic PV GS31,am interested in the batteries listed here, but there are no info about the ""operating time"" of these battries.Can any one suggest me a battery which gives me a long shooting time with my LCD Panel open.Am looking for batteries which can give me 3 hrs+ shooting time,the battery comes with the camera gives only 45mins without LCD open. Pls adviceThanks"
4,An early Industrial group still can make its mark.,"For any of you who are big on Nine Inch Nails, Machines of Loving Grace, or other groups of the Industrial persuasion, this CD is a must-have. This collection of songs by Controlled Bleeding covers the more than twenty year carreer of a group that managed to stay fresh and original despite changes in the times. While not as heavily into industrial loops as Nine Inch Nails, clearly Trent Reznor must have gleaned some of his style from Controlled Bleeding. Intense songs such as ""Assembly"" and ""Fodder Song,"" as well as lower key songs such as ""The Peacock (Music for four guitars)"" paint a broad mosiac of Industrial in it's heyday. In fact, very few bands in the genre could recieve higher praise. The Best of Controlled Bleeding is a great introduction to an even greater band, and even contains a couple of rarities for the more seasoned fan."
1,Outdor temperature sensor,I purchased this model and 8117CTWC in 2004 and 2005 The outside temperature sensor died after 1 year the fist time ten months after the second time 2006 got a replecment sensor wich did not work at all
3,Kaput after 2.5 years,"After about 2 1/2 years of very good service, our unit developed 2 problems: poor communication with the transmitter, and wacky displays of indoor temperature (100+, and it's not that hot in here!). The company says the transmitter is weakening, and suggested buying another. The odd temp readings are ""rare,"" and their only suggestion was to make sure we're using fresh batteries (we are). Looks like we're getting a new one."
2,Not Worth the Hassle,"I bought this tank from our local aquarium store when I decided to switch from my bettas to something a little more high maintenence. Despite my reservations about its weight (even empty), the tank seemed great at first -- built in filter, built in heater and light, great design.Then came time to do a full water change.When this batch of fish dies, I will be throwing this tank in the trash. It is too unwieldy to work with it at all. After siphoning the majority of the water from the tank, I tried to tip the tank to get the last of the water and to start scooping out the rocks. Not only was it hard to find a place to grip, the tank itself was almost too heavy to move, let alone tip and maneuver.My recommendation is to just by a normal tank and all the accessories. This one just isn't worth the hassle."
5,Lithium Coin Battery,My camera was not working well. This fixed the problem. It came within a few days. The price was great!
5,No opinion at this time,I bought this battery for my digital camera so I could set the date and time. I'm not able to get the date and time to hold . I don't know if its the battery or my ignorance of understanding directions. I have other priorities at this time. .
2,Just made me nauseous,Didn't see any movement other than money being moved out of my pocket.I didn't expect it to move mountains-it only made me nauseous. Yuk
4,One of my all time favorites...,"There's just something about disk one of this double CD: the first nine tracks flow together in a most stimulating and hypnotic way (by Air Liquide, 808 State, Bando de Gaia, et al). I own a huge stack of Trance collections, including others from the Volume label (volumes 1 and 2, Breakbeat Science, etc.), but I've never found anything that switches me on like disk one of this set. Highly recommended."
4,Decent instant coffee,"I like Bru instant coffee. I am not sure what the effect of the chicory is, but it tastes different from Nescafe, more like South Indian-style filter coffee. There are cheaper places than Amazon to get it though. Be sure to check out a local ethnic Indian grocery store."
2,Not Fair Trade- NOT organic!,"For the sake of the coffee bean farmers around the world, try to support those companies who pay a fair wage to the farmer. Fair trade coffees are usually grown in ""bird-friendly"", ""tree-friendly"" and pesticide, chemical-free plantations too. Check out Higher Grounds for instance..."
1,7-in-1 hole saw,"The first time I used the Great Neck 7-in-one hole saw, the drill part broke into 3 parts. Also, the quality of the blades are no comparison to the original set that I have used for years. I would not re-order this product again. I ended up buying a competitors product."
5,Good quality parts.,"I also ordered a Monroe 71555. One is the left strut, and the other is the right. I received quality parts at absolutley the BEST available price."
5,Pobre Ana,"Pobre Ana is a great book for beginning Spanish students. It is easy to understand, and if one purchases the CD it really helps because the native speaker does an excellent job reading it and makes it very understandable. The book increases ones Spanish vocabulary greatly. If you are serious about learning the Spanish language then this is the book for you. It is a ""gateway"" to further reading and understanding Spanish. Lee"
3,"Good ideas, but not for everybody","This book features 26 different architectural ideas from Japan. Unfortunately, the ideas presented are quite unique and not quite to my taste. I prefer things and designs to be more practical for everyday life, rather than marvels of aesthetics and futuristic design. I was a bit disappointed. I expected more from this book when I purchased it. Nonetheless, it will be a great coffee table book."
3,"Good Music, annoying clapping of the audience","This was an overall great concert. Trini Lopez comes back to the stage after 20 years! One major complaint is the annoying audience clapping that is dubbed over the concert! When the camera pans over the audience while this clapping is going on, one can clearly see that audience is not even clapping, therefore it must have been dubbed. Even so, it is great to hear the excellent music in modern-day sound quality."
3,"Sloppy, but informative","There's a lot of good information in it, but it gets hard to read at times due to poor organization/editing."
5,"We bought 2 Copies... One for us, the other for our Attorney...","I recommend this book for anyone who has kids. Especially if you are or forsee yourself going through any type of custody decision or change of any kind. Some of the information is common sense and secondhand. Some of it we have already tried and failed and/or succeeded. But the majority of it is stuff we never even thought about....Fantastic book... I bought the first copy for my husband... He is going through an ongoing custody ""MESS"" on a regular basis. Our attorney requested a copy and I bought it for her also. She also praises the book."
4,Very Good Recording!,"Lisa Hilton is Jazz music's hidden gem. The Malibu, California resident has worked with many of genre's greatest professionals. Her previous CD's I reviewed were highly recommended with Hilton receiving plenty of airplay. Her latest CD, ""My Favorite Things"" continues the formula she develops, mixing American standards to her original compositions and having musician extraordinaires such as Saxophonist, Eric Marienthal. Hilton does wonders on classics such as Jobim's, ""Desafinado"" The Gershwin brothers', ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" and Paul Desmond's, ""Take Five"". Her latest original compositions are very good. ""Seduction/remix"" is clearly the best track on this CD with its soulful beats and nice sax playing. It's hard for me so say it, but there were a few misses on this CD. I wasn't sure about the track, ""Midnight Sky"". It seemed to out of place in the track selection. Despite the slight flaw, this CD is still a wonderful listen. Recommended."
1,A terrible book,This book is wrong. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that AIDS is late stage HIV. To believe otherwise is to be confused by semantics. This confusion has cost so much to countries like South Africa. Please don't buy this irresponsible and misleading book.
1,Cheap but cheap,Our first copy of this modem had a components fall off of the psb. Otherwise it does what it is supposed to do. I'm buying another but won't pay more than $20.
2,router,The router had a short in it and had to be physically maneuvered so it would work. It is frustrating to have to not be able to just turn it on and it work.

5,Family Funtime is Fabulously Funny!,"Bill Larkin is a master of comedy songs. This CD is hilarious. His songs about his family can be related to by anyone who ever had a family...See him perform live and risk laughing yourself sick...this CD is almost as good as seeing him live...and if you laugh yourself sick at least you'll be home! I have heard I'm Just Your Mom twenty times and I still laugh out loud. Buy it, enjoy it and then give a copy to that special member of YOUR family!"
2,"layout not kids (reader) friendly, non-engaging",subscribed to this despite multiple negative reviews. should have heard to those. there are enough feedback and NG should address it. i am already looking for alternative options.
2,feel cheated,"I expected more of the artwork from this mag. I enjoyed the characters. The costumes where wonderful. But the artwork, was nothing but sketches. It looked like he found a bunch of sketches lying around and made a story out of them. The pictures in between the stories where great. I wonder why he didn't actually take the time to draw pictures for the stories instead of using the sketches. I am pretty dissapointed in this book and artist. I hope he does better with the artwork next time. If I am able to peek inside the book next time and see actual artwork, I would by the book. ""I got punked"""
2,Not so Hot Shot!,"I cannot get this game to stand up straight like the image shows, it tends to slouch. My daughter uses it more for a clubhouse then a toss game. And I think it would of been better if they used bean bags instead of plastic balls to throw into the holes. It pretty much stays folded up tucked behind the back of her toy box."
2,not worth the money for me!,My 2 yr old just doesn't pay this any mind. So I'm selling it and replacing it with something he will play with!
5,Timeless Truths for This Generation,"Kenneth Hagin's timeless pearls of wisdom and revelatory insights are captured in this valuable collection.This collection begins with fundamental truths: God & you, the truth about hell, the Holy Spirit and faith. Then deeper truths are explored including: the anointings of God, creative power of the tongue, the glory of God, and working miracles.Reading these wonderful testimonies and teachings, I am reminded of the work and teaching of Smih Wigglesworth. There are so many similarities betwen the two: a powerful faith, healing ministries, absolute conviction in the power of God to perform His word in the Here and Now.Hagin stirs the faith of believers. He challenges us to believe God. To stand upon His word and act accordingly. The power of the Holy Spirit is as much for us today as it was 2,000 years ago. I am grateful for this book and this brother who now walks with God."
2,Not the best Dickson novel,"A Dickson-brand, but not one of his best.Cully When lands in a prison on charges soon to be learned--a plot with aliens to overturn Earth's council. Cully decides to prove them right, only he plots with the freed earth colonies.Not really insightful, aliens not quite convincing (compared to Cherryh, as the master of credible alien cultures, Dickson is a baby), the story ends suddenly and the style is ... not bad , but not good either.Maybe a fanatic of Dickson's would like it better. I did not."
1,Research the author before you decide to take his word,I feel that it is dishonest to present this book as an unbiased look at this great man. It should be known that the author is an excommunicated anti-mormon and all claims in this book should be looked at with the knowledge that it is most likely slanted in an unfriendly light whenever it is possible. I do not believe many of the claims in this book. Just keep in mind that it is written by a man with an agenda and is far from unbiased.
4,"A top-notch book, well worth buying.","This book is very pretty to look at. It has lots of good pictures allowing you to follow most examples through step-by-step. The clear instructions accompanying the pictures (or vice-versa) make it easy to use, even for beginners. I found that the diverse range of projects have been useful for me many times. It has taught me the Art of Parchment Craft so well that I have been asked to demonstrate this craft for a local ladies group. I would love to see more books by the same author."
2,needs to go deeper,"This book is basically asking the different boxers the same questions and finding out how many rounds to do the different exercises: shadow boxing, heavy bag, speed bag, jump rope etc... kind of repetitive stuff.It would have been a bit more interesting to find out what they do when they shadow box, or heavy bag, and how do they change their workouts. It needed less boxers but more in depth info."
3,A quick read,"As a boxing fan, I wanted to check this book out to see the workout ideas of the great boxers. To be honest, the glimpses into their training regimes are fairly short and repetitive. I would have liked a bit more on even just one boxer but the author did give his own training routine and some good tips.The pictures were pretty good in the book. A quick read."
5,Nice read,"I've always been curious and fascinated about how different boxers train. It's amazing that fighters toil, sacrifice and train for months for a few minutes of action.This book gives you a glimpse of how fighters basically eat, live and prepare prior to the showdown in the ring. Granted, no one fighter will follow the same template as another, and a boxer's needs will change from fight to fight. However, Roadwork, jumping rope, bag work and excercises have been a constant in the boxing regimen for decades.Some, such as Ali shunned weights and others used weights. However, Roy Jones for a fact did reluctantly lift before fighting Ruiz in order to bulk up, however the rest of the time he uses calisthenics as a part of his routine.I have to give the author credit for his effort that went into the book and the caliber of fighters he interviewed for the material. His passion about the sport is evident on each page.A great book both for reading and reference purposes."
3,Good but very repetative,"This is not a bad book. The problem is that every champ's training routine is pretty much the same. One of the major flaws is that it does not detail any type of strength training routine. Any decent book on boxing training will pretty much tell you what is here. It's all pretty much the same: roadwork, hitting the bag, sparring, etc. No champion level secrets are revealed whatsover."
1,Two strikes....,"Look great on paper, but the optics on the first one I received were misaligned, giving a double image that would not converge. Assuming that was a fluke, I exchanged the item. On the second one, the plastic piece housing the axial rod around which the oculars rotate when changing interpupillary distance was split down the middle, rendering this one useless as well. Perhaps I would have had better luck with a third unit, but clearly there are some major problems in manufacturing and quality control."
3,just adequate,"They are okay but need better cups for the eye. Basically you get what you pay for. Compact, easy to carry but just so-so for image quality and ease of use."
3,"OK, for a very compact binocular",These binoculars are very portable so easy to pack and carry on our trip to Alaska. I have not tested the waterproof feature which is why I bought them but I am a bit diappointed in the clarity. Ok for the price but I wish I had invested a bit more money to have a better view of the wildlife we saw on our trip.
3,All over the place,"I have to classify this as a ""fans only"" sort of album. Definitely start with the band's other recordings (""Inindependence"" and ""Flemish Altruism""). This is a last gasp collection of odds and ends, and the quality and style of the tracks varies wildly.Still, for fans I have to give this a pretty strong recommendation - if you like A Minor Forest, some of the tracks on here are among their very, very best work. ""Cocktail Party"" is great, crushing rock. ""Well Swayed"" is a masterful soft/loud, slow/fast workout. Some of the more experimental tracks, such as ""Speed for Gavin (The Lesser Version)"" work really well; some, such as the extremely-too-long ""The Convent"", really don't. In general, the 2nd disc has the stronger material.So, if you find yourself hankerin' for more after getting the other 2 full-length CDs, then I recommend this disc. But don't start here!"
4,Thanks for the Ausies,"Thanks to Raven Records you can track down Hoyt Axton recordings. This album set is partcularly strong on the first disc, ""Joy to the World."" May surprise folks to find out the many songs that Hoyt Axton wrote. This gives you his interpretations. ""Lighting Bar Blues"" is especially fun for the Busch beer fans and any other bar flies."
4,God He Reigns,"Another great album from Hills, they just keep praising Jesus and have success after success"
5,Perfect!!,This set is perfect for all ages and skills. They are very resistant and easy to carry.Is the perfect size for practices.
3,Single PUGG Goal,"Quality of training Goal was good. But be careful of product description!! The ""(PR)"" in the description suggests a pair of goals is included, as is the case for a number of other competitive product offerings. Only a SINGLE goal is included. I would not have purchased product at the price I paid if I had understood this."
5,Great portable product to take anywhere!,"These things are not only a great idea... but a well designed and manufactured product. Made from durable, high quality materials... these things are built to last. And they are super easy to pop up / tear down / pack away so you can bring them along anywhere!Highly recommended..."
2,Not a pair,"This is not a pair of goals, it is only one goal. The other vendors sell these goals as a pair. I don't know what the ""PR"" on the end of the item description stands for, but it's not ""pair"" ... very deceiving!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT,We purchased this for our daughter (age 9) for Christmas so she could practice in the back yard. The set up is easy enough for her to do it herself. She isn't able to fold the nets back up but she can put them in the handy bag and put them away. Great product!
3,Read the description!,"I put this on my wishlist for the kids, and so didn't read closely enough that this set is for ONE GOAL ONLY. What a swiz. Obviously now I understand why it says there's $95 off the retail price. It's because you only get half the set! I phoned the distribution company and they told me that they open the box and take one out. So when the box turns up you think you are getting two (because the picture on the box says so), but you are only getting one. Very sneaky."
4,A quick and Efficient Method to Transfer Slides,"I had several hundred old 35mm slides and was looking for a quick efficient method to transfer them to my computer. It took a bit of experimenting with the light source to find the perfect set up and I eventually decided it was easier without my tripod. I finally found that using a plain sheet of white paper taped in front of a 100 watt bulb worked best for me. Because my Kodak DX7590 has auto focus, some slides were difficult to reproduce perfectly.Once underway, however, I was able to satisfactorily transfer all of my slides in just a few days. Remember that poorly exposed slides do not make great copies. My Photo Shop software was a big help. For the price, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to save old slides."
5,One of my favorites,"This is truly one of Susie's best albums. The song, ""You'll get through this"", is awesome. I listen to this album at least once a day, I know that who ever buys this album will love it as much as I do. It's very rare that when you buy an album you like every song, on this album for me, I love every song."
1,pavbama,This review applies to wooster frames sold at lowes. It does not have wing nuts to tighten. It instead has plastic latches that flip up or down. Which leads to my poor rating of the product. The frame was constantly loosening up as I used the roller. After the roller fell off the end of the pole a couple of times I realized that this product is not well made. If the frame didnt loosen this would be a handy product.
3,HP 4100N,This is a great work horse printer. The only downside of thisolder model is the lack of a USB port. Must use parallel or jet directprint server/ethernet connection.
4,A work hourse printer,"I have used this print for years. My old HP needed work so I went looking for a used one so I do not have to configure a different printer, More importantly to get this quality printer new would cost hunders more, The printer is good for invoicing as well as any work you have to print without color. Buy it."
2,Not the best of the breed books,"This book is a basic dog book with pictures of Aussies stuck in. I did not find it interesting or worth buying. Get All About Aussies, either version, or Australian Shepherds, Champions of Versitility, instead."
3,"Tasty and creative, but not very healthy.","This book has a wealth of creative recipes for grains, and the ones I tried were delicious. The ""Four Seasons Olympic Bran Muffins"" are so good, you could easily forget they're bran muffins, but like many recipes in the book, they have a very high sugar content. Low fat is definitely not a priority in this book either. In many of the recipes, the whole grain is a very minor ingredient. The book provides excellent general information about each grain and is useful for creative inspiration, but if you want healthy recipes, look elsewhere."
3,Tasty food if you are trying to kill yourself,"I would guess anyone looking for a cookbook on grains would be thinking of healthy recipes that are also tasty. Well, you have come to the wrong cookbook. Make no mistake about it, the recipes are pretty delicious, but if I made a regular habit out of serving these butter & cream laden artery-cloggers at dinner, I would be slowly eating myself to death. To echo the earlier reviewer, look elsewhere for healthy recipes.The 3 stars represent a combined rating. Because the recipes are tasty & pretty easy to prepare, I give the book 5 stars. Because of the utter lack of healthy recipes, despite the title leading you to believe otherwise, I give it 1 star.Forewarned is forearmed. Enjoy these recipes, but don't overdo it."
1,Straight Garbage!,"I absolutely love Digital Underground and I thought this CD would have the full versions of all the songs that I bought it for. I was HIGHLY disappointed when I bought it and listened to it just to learn that ""The way we swing"", ""No Nose Job"", ""Packet Man"", ""Kiss you back"" and ""Return of the Crazy One"" were all remixes--and not extended remixes with more to funk to--SHORTENED remixes that are not as good as the originals. I hate to give DU anything other than 5 stars, my beef is clearly not with them or the quality of their music, its this garbage CD that short changes you with half-arse songs. One star may be a little harsh, the music is still great, but Im just upset that the 9 minute tracks have been shortened to 4."
5,"Finally, a new vinyl of the Humpty Dance and others...","After searching for the past two years for an unopened, unused record of the original Humpty Dance, I was very happy to find this album. It is a must-have for DJs, as it includes all of the original hits from Digital Underground. The songs, although old, still sound great and still move the crowds."
5,Very inspiring and a great message in the songs,"This CD is a must to own.Every song is a message to the young, and the old."
5,Burmese Cat Book,"This is the bible of the Burmese breeders, the best book ever written for a breeder of the Burmese cat..A must.. much better than the American one.. with better photos and pedigree's from the original cats used."
2,Red Devil 3-inch metal scraper-OUCH!!,"I used this scraper for cleaning my lawn mower deck from dried lawn clippings. It works great except for one issue, and that is the sides of the blade are extremely sharp, and i cut my finger on it. Call me crazy but it should not be this sharp..."
4,Great Collection of Trance.,"I bought this used on a business trip back in '96 and throw it in the player once in a while. I gotta say, the 2nd CD is much stronger than the first in my opinion. I love the track ""Oneski"" by Richard H. Kirk (in one of his original post-Cabaret Voltaire personas), and here's some Paul Van Dyk (PVD) before he became the powerhouse DJ he is today.Overall, a good mix of chill, dance, and drum and bass."
2,Poorly Written,"I have the 12th edition of this book, and I assume not much changed in the 13th. This book is difficult to comprehend. The wording is often awkward and the sentences are too long. The information in the book is good, but the way it is written makes understanding anything very frustrating. I find myself having to re-read paragraphs trying to find the original intent of what the author is trying to convey."
2,Hard to swallow,"I had to purchase this book for class and I have to say that our teacher could have chosen a better book for us to read. While it does have a lot of history about Unions and labor realations throughout the past century, reading this is like watching paint dry. It is overly repetitive and extremely long winded for no reason what so ever. This book is hard to swallow; I would rather go on a really bad date. :("
1,Rather dry,"This book was impossible to read and remain awake. The instructor for the class in which the book was required, insisted on reading every word of every chapter. If it didn't cost so much I think I would burn it!"
3,Outer frame needs a polish!,"The lid to the holder has a good polished finish to it, but the outer frame to the holder is not to the same quality of polish as the lid.But this was the best designed Recessed Toilet Holder I could find, and is just the job! Althougth a little disappointed with the standard of polish finish on the outer frame."
4,recessed toilet tissue holder,"Looks good, protects the toilet paper from the cat who thinks it is a scratching post, relatively easy to install."
3,Beware of sharp edge on cover,"We bought this for a bathroom remodel. Yes, you need to order the mounting clamp separately. The tissue paper holder is not quite as classy as it appears in the photo and the quality is disappointing. The cover was sharp enough to present a cutting hazard, so we had to hone it down. It was just stamped out and assembled without being polished off. This item is made in China.We thought $30 or thereabouts would get us an decent enough toilet paper roll holder. We would have opted to pay more for better quality had we known this item was sub par."
5,"a good machine, I bought one from soyajoy at cheaper price",This is a good soymilk maker. My friend bought it. I searched the web and bought the exact same machine from a US distributor at $10 less. It has a different brand name (soyajoy) but exactly same machine because we compared the two machine in every detail. I always make sure I search the net to get the best price.
3,Works well but...,"I purchased the milk maker about a month ago primarily as a cost saver. My wife was drinking a lot of soy milk in place of cow's milk for health reasons. The retail price of soy milk was about $4.00 a quart. The Soy Milk Maker cuts that cost to nearly zero because we get our soy beans free. The machine works relatively well although it dosn't completly grind all the beans. The one time I tried making rice milk lead to a gooey, very sticky mess and very bad tasting, very watery milk. I'll NEVER use this machine for that purpose ever again! Clean-up of the machine is clumbsy and akward but do-able. All-in-all it's a good, well made machine that produces quality soy milk. Straining the milk through a cheese cloth significantly improves the flavor. In my opinion it comes down to a cost/benefit issue. If someone is willing to take the time and hastle of cleanning the milk maker then it's a worthwhile purchase."
1,Unsatisfactory quality,"I purchased this soy milk maker about 1 year ago based on its pretty good reviews here in Amazon.First one month, it was all good. However, it started to show wear-out sign not long after. First, it generated more and more noise. Soon we found that a bolt on the bottom was loose and detached. That's probably the reason for noise. Later, we discovered that some whole soy beans can still be found in the maker or not completely grinded even after the milk making process was done. Now it's a little more than 1 year old and we cannot use it anymore."
1,Manttra pressure cooker,Plastic pressure valve broke first time it was used. But Amazon does state they'll take it back and credit me.
1,junk,"I have used this less than 30 times. After about 10 uses it showed significant corrosion on the lock flap, although it is supposed to be stainless steel. Now the safety plunger has fallen out, rendering it useless. Absolute garbage."
5,Mom loves this pressure cooker!,My mom was looking for a Manttra 8Qt pressure cooker to replace the one she's had for 6+ years. She uses it regularly to cook her beans (among other things) and even tried another brand but that one was bad. When I found this on Amazon she was so delighted at the low price that she asked me to order 2. She loves it.
3,It's a Cage,All cage rollers are very similar in their construction. This one isn't any different than any other cage roller out there. I personally like the wood handle and the solid extension hole but it really isn't different than a cheaper model.
1,CHINA MADE JUNK,"purchased based on photo showing ""made in USA"" on the handle. What i received is a piece of china made junk.steer clear, you can buy junk like this anywhere for $2, falsely represented!"
1,Defective design,I bought this watch to wear on my vacation to Guatemala. I wanted something inexpensive in case it was stolen. The first day I wore it I was out jogging and it broke and fell off my arm scratching the crystal. One of the pins attaching the band to the watch had fallen out. I took it to a local watch repairman and he fixed it. On my first day in Guatemala the watch fell apart again and my husband lost the pin while trying to fix it. I have other Skagen watches that are designed differently. If you look at how this one is put together it seems that it is designed to fall apart.
5,A great bargain,"I bought this for my wife as an anniversary present for our 11th anniversary (Traditionally-steel). It has a sleek and elegant design butthe picture doesn't do it justice, the stainless steel is highly polished and the mother of pearl face gives off beautiful colors in changing lighting.The band is comfortable, easily adjusted and the clasp is very sturdy, I own a few Skagen's (3) and besides a couple of batteries they have never given me a problemWatch has a light thin design and the face is about the size of a nickel."
4,perfection,"i have wanted a skagen watch for -- oh -- 20 years maybe, and this one is little, and perfect, and JUST THE RIGHT SIZE for a not too big wrist. and it's very nice to wear to the opera as well as out to dinner. i have another less attractive watch i wear when i am going to sweat or run around in a busy city, but as a ""dress"" watch it is to die for."
5,Very Nice and Elegant,I bought this for my wife as a gift. Very nicely designed and looks great in her wrist.
1,One day wonder!,"I had a similar experience as another purchaser. My wife wore this for less than a day and the pin holding the band to the body came out and was lost. I bought this as a birthday gift and now my wife's present is on its way back to Amazon.This really is too bad. The band, and mother of pearl face were very pretty. Still, I cannot give more than one star because of my experience."
5,Great watch - I like the style,"I like the simple minimalism-style design, mesh strap and a sleek, appear-to-be-thin body.I have had this watch for almost a year. There are a few scratches on the steel frame of the dial. I wish it would have been more scratch resistant. But for the price and design, highly recommended."
1,Shiny Piece of Junk,"Amazon Return window of about a month turned out to be just longer than this watch worked. Lasted for about 35 days, then died. Don't waste your time with this product."
1,Not for slim wrists,"The hinge which connects the watch to the band is very stiff and does not conform to the curvature of a slim wrist. It's a pretty watch, but I had to return it because it fit me like a bangle bracelet."
2,watch out if you break it,"I purchased this watch at a dept store and enjoyed it. Ruined the mesh strap after a year by accident and ordered a new one from Skagen. It arrived defective and I didn't feel like trying to pay more money for the return postage. I wore it for awhile and it snagged every sweater. Now I just don't wear it. Nice item, poor customer service from maker. Don't buy at dept store - way too expensive."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I should have returned it. The clasp does not hold. I have almost lost this watch many, many times. One day I will..."
3,Not quite what it says on the tin.,"I bought this for my mum who had one just like it until my sister lost it. However when my mum bought hers, there were two Women's models, that looked exactly the same except one had a larger watch face than the other. I looked around like mad to find the one with the bigger dimensions, and found it here. However when I finaly got it, it ended up being the smaller one. We have surrendered, and have lost all hope of finding the larger Women's watch and have stuck with it.It is still beautiful and very comfortable (so she tells me)"
5,Elegant but simple watch,"I am not a watch-wearer. I stay away from most jewelry. However, the annoyance of carrying my phone everywhere so as to know what the time is finally got to me and I ordered this watch. I love it. It is incredibly easy to put on and to adjust (who knew the size of a person's wrist could fluctuate so much?). The mesh band is unique and feels smooth on my wrist. The face is very flat. The face does have a subtle mother-of-pearl thing going on, where it is slightly iridescent in the light, that I didn't see in the picture. Overall, this watch is a great value."
5,Almost returned it till my engineer DH figured out how to work the catch,"When the watch arrived, I didn't think it would last more than a day on my wrist. I liked the appearance (although the face is a little larger than I'd like) but no way could I get the catch to, well, catch. Spent 45 mins trying to figure out how to fix it when DH (who was convinced at first I had the catch upside down) showed me that it's a two-stage catch. At the end, you should be seeing the word Skagen when you look at the inside of your wrist. I would feel like an idiot posting this except that 2 other people here have had problems with the catch. It's actually very snug and good when you get it right. Very pretty mother of pearl face, and band has a nice sparkle."
2,Broken face,"I love Skagen watches and have worn them for 8 years.But on this specific model the face covering broke within two months of wearing it (not everyday either). I am bummed, my skagen's usually last much longer."
5,I love it!,I bought this yesterday on the recommendation of the girl working in the paint department and I absolutely love it. You do need a very steady hand while working with this tool and need to be careful to not use to much paint but it makes a huge difference. I did not have to tape off anything and was able to create a nice clean edge while painting. You may want to read some more indepth reviews on similar items to get a clear idea on how to use this properly. It does work like a charm and I will never use tape again.
2,"Better than a brush, but can use vast improvement","I agree with the other reviewer who said, ""When you push it along the ceiling the pad slides down the holder makeing an uneven line. The only way I could get a straight line was to push with one hand and use my thumb nail of the other hand to keep the pad from slipping down the holder.""In addition, I will say that, if you get too much paint on the pad, it will taint the wheels, and then, you're wheeling paint onto your neat edge. Yes, this is exactly what you were trying to avoid in the first place.That said, it's a neater job than I could do with a brush, and I still buy them, until something better comes along."
4,Fascinating Layers of Meaning,"Brennan presents an intriguing perspective in these plays. She has a wonderful ability to capture the nuance of speech, a command of metaphor that is arresting, and a darkly comic view that is entertaining and somewhat disturbing.I had the opportunity to see one of these play (Having) in performance. Brennan's words and images are a banquet.I noticed that one of her plays - Tiger's Heart - is out of print. I find this fact distressing as this work is her most fascinating. I have a copy, but I'm not letting go of it!"
4,One of America's best young stylists,"And I don't mean hair stylists. Wallace is, line by line, one of the most gifted writers around. It's not just that he's funny - though at times, he is hysterically so - or that he's moving -- the poignant last line is profoundly so -- but that he's capable of taking readers so quickly from humor to pathos, from cleverness and arch irony to regret and sadness. This is a writer who has honed his craft, who has complete command of the language and can use it to express the deep ambivalence of most lives today. Ray's is the archtypical American life: so good in some ways, and so empty in others (a la American Beauty). And yet Wallace never makes excuses for him, and never makes him a false hero. Ray is one of us - which is what makes this slight volume something that will stay with you, long after that lovely ending."
4,That's a good song,"Well, I really think that retro version of It's Over Now is cool. I have those groovy beats playing in my head right now. And of course I like We Can't Be Friends, that's a pretty song. I don't care much for the allstar mix, but no problem."
5,Great Service,I ment to order the CR2016 which I did reorder and receive. Both orders came quickly and were as expected.
1,out of date arguments,"After reading this book, I went to political comment sections of the internet and watched what was being said following news stories involving abortion. It seems that the pro-choice crowd has learned a thing or two themselves.I won't bother going over in detail the reasoning contained in this book. Suffice to say that the opposition has found ways to deal with every pro-life argument this author puts forth. This book is fine for those preaching to the choir. However, it is not going to give you any advantage over a seasoned, intelligent pro-choice supporter.If you want to know what the other side is thinking, get your toes wet and wade thru the internet at liberal news sites."
1,AUTHOR IS INCORRECT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF ASHEVILLE,"THE AUTHOR'S DESCRIPTION OF ASHEVILLE NORTH CAROLINA IS NOWHERE NEAR HISTORICALLY CORRECT AND IS MISSING SEVERAL KEY POINTS. THE AUTHOR WRITES, IN HER BOOK, THAT ASHEVILLE IS A TRENDY MOUNTAIN BOOM TOWN WHICH IS CORRECT. HOWEVER, SHE FURTHER WRITES THAT ONLY A GENERATION AGO ASHEVILLE NC WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BUCOLIC BACKWATER TOWN, BEST KNOWN AS THE SITE OF THE BILTMORE ESTATE AND FORMER PLAYGROUND OF THE VANDERBILT FAMILY AND HOME OF THOMAS WOLF. THE FACT IS THAT ASHEVILLE HAS ALWAYS (AT LEAST SINCE 1895) BEEN A SOPHISTICATED LITTLE CITY AND WAS LABELED ""PARIS OF THE SOUTH"" IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY BECAUSE IT WAS SO WELL KNOWN FOR ITS THEATRE, OPERA, AND ELECTRIC STREET CARS. ASHEVILLE WAS THE SECOND CITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE ITS OWN ELECTRIC STREET CARS, RICHMOND, VA. THE FIRST.THE AUTHOR DID NOT DO HER RESEARCH ON ASHEVILLE SO HOW CAN I KNOW THAT THE REST OF HER BOOK IS AUTHENTIC?"
4,Lone Wolf by Maryanne Vollers,This is an interesting and straight forward book about the Atlanta Olympic and Birmingham Abortion bombings.The author does a great job bringing all the people involved together and their stories in this sad epic of Eric Rudolph's inhumane action to his fellow man and society.
3,Excellent Research,"Maryanne Vollers certainly has done her investigative work, interviewing dozens of people including Rudolph. This is an excellent research paper, but a bit slow in parts. If you are into facts, names, and dates, and are ok with a somewhat dry style, then this book is for you.""Life's Been A Blast"" (also available on Amazon) was written by one of the bombing survivors, is easier to read, and gives the view of the crime from in front of the bomb instead of immortalizing the murderer behind the remote control. I admit to being partial to ""Life's Been A Blast"" because I was involved in writing it, but I highly suggest reading about the events from both sides if you want a well-rounded understanding of Rudolph's crimes and their impact."
4,Visionary,"Not for everyone, but a particular treat for those who enjoy perverse audio tinkering. Superb, freaky music that defies description."
4,They get 4 out of 5 for being underated!,"I normally save 4 stars for absolutely GREAT albums and 5 for classic/genius ones. This is a very solid release. Maybe not GREAT, but very good stuff. A bit repetetive in parts. A very good balance between electronic, moog/arp, synth and country/folk rock n' roll. Check out ""shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah"" as well. Good stuff kids. Throw out your limp bizquik and pick up some ya hear.'!"
2,"Good history, bad trail guide",This old standard has some great history of the area. But if you try to find the Rock Rooms or many other hikes from this book you will get very lost. Many descriptions are dated and were not very helpful to start with. For one hike you're told to find a rock shaped like a seal on top of a mountain covered with hundreds of strange shaped rocks. Is it the whole seal or just a head? Big or little? Not much help I'm afraid. Get it for the history but get another book to hike with.
2,Not very helpfull,"Info is very dated and hard to follow. I've tried using this book several times and almost always find it very difficult to find the trail head. There are no maps, and the ones that are included are hand drawn and crude. I gave it 2 stars, as it does have some interesting information about the area."
4,Captivating,"This is not a biography, per se. The ""Childhood of Famous Americans"" books are a series of fictionalized accounts of the youth of famous Americans. The conversations and (some) scenarios may be made up, to show the character formation of the famous person. The places and names of people are biographical; some of the situations are probably not.Having said that... we like this series very well.And wow, we have enjoyed Thomas Edison! The book emphasizes values like responsibility, curiosity, and hard work. Some of the stories made us laugh, and they all made us even more interested to find out what would happen next. Our kids were the most excited about Thomas's laboratory in the basement, and in his job on the train."
4,Great Lakes,We are using this book with our Literature Study. The girls have enjoyed all of Thomas's creativity. We have also gotten to experiment with several of his projects. They are lot of fun! Great book to learn to be more creative in life.
2,Not for everybody!!!,"I used to use the rectangular Speedo paddles and I tried to switch to these new paddles based on the rave reviews. I ordered Medium paddles based on most reviewers stating that the paddles were made large. I received the paddles and my hands practically wrapped around the paddles. In addition to this, the paddles did not fit my hand in the grooves provided. My guess is that these paddles are designed for youths, even though there is no indication of that. I'm going to return the paddles and go back to the original rectangular ""old reliable"" Speedo paddles."
4,Great paddles,"Once you create a grip pattern that works and is comfortable with your hands in the pool, then it is perfect. I recommend trying a few different configurations initially, and then selected the best."
2,Snapped!,The straps broke after two months and now I can not find any replacement. So the pads are useless... need to sell additional straps or supplies!
2,Awkward!,"I swam two lengths with these to realize that they were not for me. It's not that they were of poor quality; rather, they were simply awkward to use, without any clear benefits. The problem for me was that I was unable to keep my arms stable as I swam with them. My arms moved either left or right (instead of down and back) during the strokes. After several fits and starts, I have decided to give up on using them, and plan to sell them soon. One additional point: I advise you to check with your pool to be sure that they allow such devices to be used in a public swimming area. Rules aside, it seems obvious to me that an accidental swipe with these against another swimmer's arms or legs could cause injury."
1,They sent me 2 left-hand paddles,"They sent me the correct size. But they sent me two paddles for the left hand, so unless I've gone through life with a wrong understanding of basic physiology, I think these are useless to me. Don't have time to contact Amazon, ship the item back, wait for a new pair -- after all, online ordering is supposed to circumvent adding stress to your life -- so I've opted to just drive down to my local SportsAuthority and buy another pair. So yes, I can contact Amazon and see what the problem was, but it makes me wonder WHY DID SOMEONE OPEN THE PACKAGE in the first place?"
5,Substitute for Gloves,"After many years of swim gloves that deteriorated from general use and pool chlorine, I decided to give these a try to see if they would last longer. So far, they are holding up nicely. They do take a bit of getting used to, coming from the gloves, but I find that paying attention to this difference really improved my stroke. The contour fits my hand nicely."
5,Excellent paddles,"I've used the paddles for about 3-4 months now.Medium size is about 8"" long and fits average hands well. My finger tips are slightly short of the upper edge. You don't want the paddles to extend further than an inch from your fingers.Depending on your stroke you may need a larger or smaller paddle. More complex hand movements require smaller paddlesFreestyle/Breast stroke: larger to mediumButterfly/back stroke: small to mediumThe paddles come with extra straps and are sturdy enough. they fit very snugly -which is necessary- and I can see how some one could break them, but I have not had to replace them with regular use."
2,I won't get these again.,"The strap on my pair of this broke within 6 months of regular swimming. I called speedo, they do not sell the strap separately, so I have to get a whole new pair. It wore out quickly as well. I liked using them but I'm going to get another kind because I really don't feel like having to go through the hassle and expense of buying new hand fins frequently. It's also needlessly wasteful. They make replacement goggle straps, why not replacement hand straps?"
4,So Far So Good.,"I have never used paddles before so I can't speak to other brands. These seem to be pretty good paddles, they are pretty easy to get on and off. They feel very natural with the contour of my hand, versus the flat paddles I used briefly at Masters Swim club. I ordered a medium and my hand measured 7"". I may have been able to use a small but I will keep these for now as I only swim freestyle. One word of caution... this week in my master swim club we used the paddles quite a bit and I noticed a burning sensation in my shoulders and upper arms for several days afterwards. This pain is different from muscle pain. I don't have any shoulder issues and I hope that the paddles don't start any. Just a word of caution for anyone who may have shoulder issues to use them sparingly. I can't speak to the reliability so that is the 4 stars rating. I always rinse them with cold water after every use to try to keep the bands from deteriorating."
5,I like it,I am not a pro and just train for sprint triathlon swims in indoor pool. No problems at all so far with quality. Delivers good load for muscles on short and fast swims (50m to 100m) and I dont see a reason to use them on long and slow swims.
3,They work but I prefer something else,"I used these in my masters class 2 times a week, they work ok, but most everyone else uses a different product and they are typically better options. These are easy enough to put on and the straps seem to work just fine (i haven't had any break)They are contoured to your hand unlike the others, which are usually all flat as boards. If you like the contour idea then this might be a good fit for you.Most of the time I would simply not put these on and instead swim with just the buoy, I felt as though I was slower and not as efficient while using these. However this could be related to the fact that I am not a great swimmer in the first place"
4,Gettysburg address for our little ones,Lincoln wrote the most important speech in American History-the short but very powerful Gettysburg Speech. This book will expose your kids to this speech in an appropriate way. The illustrations add meaning to the book.
4,perfume bottles.,"This is a wonderful book,however it caters mostly for the American collector.Regardless of this fact I am constantly referring to it. Well presented and good information."
5,Good Batteries,Just wanted to note that I receivedd this product on time and they worked as they are supposed to. They are already lasting longer in the device I use them with rather than the generic D batteries I had purchased before.I would purchase and/or recommend these batteries to others.
3,not bad,book was in pretty good condition..the front cover did appear to have what looked like dry boogers on it though but overall it was in good shape and cheap too
3,"Well written, poorly delivered","It is fairly opinionated and does not hit hard on the basic concept of the humanistic perspective. Not a very easy read, not much life-changing information, and I personally wouldn't recommend it outside of research."
1,LARGE RIP!,"We took this out of the box and luckily decided to set it up before our big camping trip. I have been camping for tents for thirty years, and have never seen a bigger piece of junk. First of all the center space does not have it's own floor, so if it rained you would have a river running through the center of your tent. When we unfolded the tent there was already a large tear in the front of it! It's going back!!"
2,uninspired and over-rated,"she should have a real singer in her band - elana is just not a strong enough vocalist to sing lead, she's ok on harmony, but that's about it. This album is just ""cutesy"". I think it is interesting how much attention this band is getting, i guess thats what you get when you hire a PR person."
3,stilted dialog,"something about this book threw me off - the storyline was good, the writing, sorry to say, was absolutely not in the same category as the best!I felt the dialog was very very stilted, did not go smoothly for me and I ended up skimming pages here and there. It annoyed me. Sorry, do not recommend."
2,okay,"There was lots of sex in this book, some pretty descriptive. I never really got a good understanding of why Julian loved her. He certainly ""wanted"" her. He was insulting to Lara and her people when first with them. I skipped through a little but did finish the book."
5,a breath of scandal,I bought this book for a friend........she reads all connie mason book....she enjoys them alot
5,MUST HAVE all breakbeat fans!,"This 2cd set is the best stuff I've ever bought! Not only does it slide through jazzy breaks and melodic lyrics, it has enough sweet breaks to make the roughest break beat fanatic cream!I would give it 10 stars except it has a lowly 5 star rate system!"
4,Great Modern Day Silent Comedy!,"""A British drummer accidentally deserts his regiment,"" so the story unfolds. The war is the American War of Independence, and the drummer is a great physical comedian. This is a fun example of what can still be done today with the silent form of comedy. A great achievement at blending silent comedy with the color film form.Evidence of a Keaton and Laurel influence can be seen. I liked the way that the comedy storyline is interwoven with a dramatic war story. The choice of music is excellent and the period costumes and warfare are well translated to the small screen. There is no way to place this film correctly, it's a comedy but also a drama. It shows battle scenes that could be right out of D. W. Griffith or comedy scenes that could be right out of Keaton. Well done."
1,A Re-do that should not EVER have been redone.,"As stated... a re-do that ruined the original greatness of the silent film ""il deserto"". Appeared ""homemade"". Sold it on Ebay in a day after watching it. Poorly made, no originality and obviously of the low / no budget documentary gendre. Suprisingly enough it is likely found on the Razzies WebSite actually amazed it was even mentioned there. If you enjoy these types of ""silents"" or ""indie films"" it may be something for you, however I REALLY DID NOT ENJOY IT and have never tried to sell a film I had originally hope to keep as part of my collection so quickly. An utter disappointment."
3,Did not meet expectations.,"First of all the bottle is far smaller than I originally thought (that's probably just my fault, however, because I'm used to the metric system so oz means little to me). It smells somewhat soapy directly from the container, but then when it blends with your natural odor it changes to a more pleasant aroma . . . eventually, because it takes some time to settle down and become subtle.If you are thinking about sandalwood based on incense you have burned be prepared to call this smell something else because it has little in common with incense sandalwood.The powder works well enough to create a nice smooth feel that lasts a very long time (depending on usage and need).Overall I deducted a couple of stars because the smell is off, the container is too small, and the price is too high for something like this. If I'd fallen in love with it and was planing on using it on a daily basis I'd be broke pretty quickly."
4,Odoriferous,"While the product does the job well, the Sandalwood fragrance is very strong. I'd prefer it to be dialed back a bit, but it's not a show-stopper.The skinny of it is, this product does what it's meant to do. If you're a smoker, you'll never notice how strong the fragrance is. If you aren't..."
1,fair product,Received product on time but the scent isn't very nice. Smells like dirt to me. I've smelled much better sandalwood scents and this isn't one of them.
3,The Good and The Bad,Although this is a great album i couldn't help feeling that deathrow are still trying to cash in on Tupacs name. Lyricly its outstanding but it has some weak beats and bad production. The title track is amazing and is the best track on the CD. The album still rises above most of the weak hip hop albums that are out at the moment and well worth the asking price. If u love 2Pac or even hip hop i recommend this album. Peace out!!!
4,Life Goes On,"Just like every other hip hop fan, when we first got word of 2pac releasing another album, i got almost as excited as pressing play on my stereo to listen to this cd for the first time. The album opens with what is possibly one of the strongest cut, Ballad of a Dead Soulja. After first listen this album wasn't what i was expecting, almost a dissapointment, but after around the 3rd listen, i smiled with releif when i realised this was another solid 'Pac album. Though it isn't his best, not by far, it is still very solid. 'Pac gives something for every hip hop fan in this album once again. Whether it's something for the thugs ballad on the afore-mentioned 'Ballad of a Dead Soulja' sticking his finger up at Bad Boy and Mobb Deep once again on 'Runnin on E' or 'Pac opening up to us on the title track. A must have along with every other 'Pac album."
4,AWESOME!!!!,"I think that this double album is GREAT! If you are a true 2Pac fan then I know you will love this. His hip hop beats and his mysterious ways of predicting the future in his songs will make you wonder, if you know what I mean. Buy this CD! You're guaranteed to get your money's worth!!"
5,2pac review,I think this cd is one of the best because of Ballad of the dead soulja is tight and also all the songs are tight rythem. My favorite one is This anin't living and my closezt roadogz.It;s has tight rhytems and the lyrics are pretty tight.
3,"Clean, but not springtime fresh.....","I have both the unedited and clean versions of 'Until The End Of Time'. I understand the purpose of having albums like this edited, but I think it takes away from what Tupac Shakur is really trying to say. In the clean version of this album, 'Big Syke Interlude' has been scrapped on the 2nd disc. Also, words being spoken by Tupac before and after the songs have either been edited, or been scrapped from the songs completely. Overall, I am pleased that ThaRow/Amaru/Interscope decided to release a clean version of this, and other albums by Tupac Shakur, but I think that the listener would get more out of the unedited versions.Clean Version: 3.5 stars Unedited Version: 5 stars"
5,2 Pac Lives on,"The legacy continues. ""Until The End Of Time"" continues to remain true to what 2pac stood for and is as hard felt as all his previous albums. The beats are awesome and the lyrics are excellent. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is already a fan or anyone who wants to get a good idea of who 2Pac a.k.a Makaveli was and what he meant to all his millions of fans."
4,until the end of time,great rapping again from pac and good beats the best song on there without a doubt is 'until the end of time' thats a classic another great lyrical and mc performance from the late legend of hip hop 2pac shakur
5,Amazing Album!!,"When Pac released All eyez on me, people were shocked. But to me Until the end of time was as good as all eyez on me. I can't name any tracks because every track on this album is awesome. I gotta give a lot of credit to Johnny ""J"" for doing his thing for Pac. I can't wait for Pac's followup of Until the end of time because it's gonna be another piece of art. This album proved that Pac is THE GREATEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME!! No one can be at his level ever again. R.I.P. 2PAC a.k.a. Makaveli"
3,Just O.K.....,"Yes it's tupac,the greatest rapper ever,yes what he did in his lifetime is fantastic bust still...This album is just so so.this album is to long,the first C.D is excellent with some very good Quincy Jones productions.But when u hear the second part of the album it's feels like the producers toke some beats on the first part and put those on the second part:all the beats look the sames and it gets very boring..All the songs like ""When thugz cry"",""runnin on E"",""my clozest roaddogz""deserved a grade like 3 out of ten. I'm lucky that I did not buy this album and that I just borought it.If u want the best 2Pac S**t ,buy ""all eyes on me"" or ""Me against the world"". Those two albums are one of the best i ever heard.Best songs: -1-Good life-2-Lil'Homiez-3-Ballad of a dead soulja-4-Breathin'-5-F****n' wit' the wrong N***a"
2,not tha same pac,"ok u see its simple. us, the true pac fans will never like this album or others like it for 2 reasons. One, We were spoiled to watch the young pac grow, and we saw his music mature with him. His sound changed so much, but it seamed he was always a step ahead of the game. Two, the albums (pre-death) were what he wanted. He spent a hell of alot of time on them... AND THEY WERE ALL FINISHED. he didn't use demos. I know that Amaru records and death row cant help this, but that is the reason that this other stuff isnt as good.one luv to pacr.i.p."
5,ONE GOOD ALBUM FROM ONE GOOD RAPPER,"This is honestly the best album from the best rapper I've ever heard. It expresses so many different emotions and covers all 2pac's styles which I have loved since 2pacaplypse now. If you enjoyed ALL EYEZ ON ME and MAKAVELI, this is a must have for any true 2pac fan."
3,when will it stop?,"I was never a huge PAc fan even when he was living. i bought Greatest Hits and i liked that for the most part. so when until then end of time came out i was hesitant but i got it. the beats are nice. Songs that i liked the first time around, were played out by the second. to me 29 songs are way to much. just because they have all that unrealeased stuff, must they release it at once? i never saw what was so good about his makaveli period. most of the music is dark and negative. he spent so much times recording music to disrespect Bigge and Badboy, and the whole east coast, that he stopped saying anything with a message. while this cd may have been hot 5 or even 3 years ago, it does little to further his reputation."
5,tha greatest,this new cd by tupac is a great one. I think that everyone should own one even if they are not a tupac fan. I like how they finally released his underground songs. He is the best music artist of all time. Tupac lives on.
4,2Pac lives on,"This Cd is good but not as good as his old stuff, how could it be? 2Pac couldnt say which songs to put in here or which ones he wanted 2 use. It's a good cd with some great trackz like All out, lil homies, Until the End of time, etc. If this was just a normal rap album i'd give it 5 stars but its 2Pac, hes the greatest of all time and these arent his best songs. I would definitely buy this cd if u like 2Pac and are a rap fan. 2Pac lives on if ur a hater ur f-cked up!"
5,classic,"T.I.P. Tupac Shakur aka Mister Makaveli, he's been dead 4 years and will be missed. His latest album is technically Makaveli wit tight tracks like letter to my unborn, f*** friends, and all out.the best cd of 2000 out-selling Jay-z and dmx in the brief 3 months of summer. a classic he wouldn't probably never realeased."
2,An Unfortuante Dissapointment,"You think with 28 songs he'd have at least 5 good ones. I am a big 2Pac fan and I wouldn't expect a poor album like this from him, or from anyone else, for that matter. All of the songs are about ghetto struggles, about his (fake) death, or about his dead homies. There are no party songs like ""I Get Around"" (which still isn't a lot compared to today's Nelly with ""Ride Wit Me"")and there aren't any of those good old joints that diss Bad Boy Records and Pac's enemies, like in ""Hit 'Em Up"". There's nothing on this album like ""Picture Me Rollin'"", ""All About U"", or any of the other old or new favorites. This is a truly dissapointing album. I try not to be hypercritical but 2Pac just doesn't cut it with these slow songs with poor lyrics."
1,"Good Music, but the CD is corrupted (""protected"")","Can't play it on your MP3 player, can't play it on your computer, can't make a copy for the car. That's lame. Don't buy it. Record company executives think they can use technology to superceed your constitutional rights. Make it clear you won't buy it."
3,Git this here CD or else!,Its abuot time 2poc made another CD! he must be gettinhg lazy... it takes him rilly long two make cDs...Aneyway...when i byed this here CDS i didnot no that 2Pac cusses so much...i like cussing...THis is a god cD..the beSt thing is that this here CD is its free...i jist put in my poket and walked out the store...what are YOU wwaiting for? christmas? Go git this CD fast like me...its rilly good if you ar a rapper fan of 2pOc like me...watch out puf diddy! 2poc fans lIke me are rabid(he he)...If you git this here Cdd 2POc can be num. 1 one tRL...Go Git IT!1
2,End of Time,"I didn't buy this album. I downloaded several songs. It was produced by Suge and has mostly new material. The songs are boring though. The only classic is ""Until the End of Time"".Don't buy this album. Just download the songs you like."
2,2.5 Stars,DO NOT listen to any of the reviews by these 2Pac groupies. Until The End Of Time is just a bunch of badly produced 2Pac songs and just about every song has two versions of them on this album. Until The End Of Time is one of the worst post death albums that they have released from 2Pac and it is a prime example of why 2Pac didn't release these songs when he was alive. This album is NOT RECOMMENDED.
1,yes he's dead. that doesn't mean this is any good.,"Hello? This is a bunch of embarassing outtakes that Pac himself wouldn't have wanted to put his name on. 2Pac would never have wanted to go out like this, Ms. Shakur. Stop pimping his legacy... And the fact that fans are so indiscriminating that they will love anything with his name on it is even more embarassing. Do you not have ears? Want lyrics? Get Aceyalone and study him. That's real hip-hop."
5,2Pac at his best!,"This album is off the chain. 2Pac is the greatest rapper of all-time. Only 1 rapper even compares to him and that is DMX. This CD contains some of 2Pac's best unreleased songs including Until The End of Time, Until The End of Time RP Mix, Letter To My Unborn, Runnin On E, All Out, and Ballad of A Dead Soulja... 2Pac is still the best and he has been gone for 6 years now. Pac is back on the scene harder than ever. The next album they release will be unbelievable too!!!"
3,let da man rest in peace,"I am so tired of lookin at the release dates charts and seein another 2pac album almost 4 years after his death. I mean come on, jus let da man rest in peace. All his posthumous albums are jus a way for record execs to get rich cuz every1 knows they will sell. Why should records be released without the consent of the artist?This cd is somethin that should never have been released (and theres another double disc bein released this year, grrrrrrr). Yes, 2pac's lyrical talent is evident throughout the cd, and da way he grabs da listener in and captures their emotion is all still there. But, if any of u have da Makaveli bootlegs, youve heard all of dis be4.Which is better? Dis cd or da Makaveli bootlegs? I would say da bootlegs. Cuz all da songs on Until have dis wack futuristic type beats, while da bootlegs captured more of his type of style of beats. Da originals definatly outshine these ""newer"" versions."
5,The Best Until The End Of Time,"I have always liked 2 Pac, but this was the first album I bought. It's one of the greatest albums ever! He was an incredible artist with words. My favorites are ""Words to my first born"" and ""Let em have it"". A MUST HAVE in your Hip-Hop/Rap collection."
4,"beats WERE better before, but Pac is always great","Before I bought this cd ""When Thugz Cry"" was about my favorite song, the beat was tight and hhis lyrics went with it. I was disappointed when I heard the new version. The beat was different and didn't have the same edge, Pac's flow didn't go with it that well and they changed the chorus completely. Pac's chorus was the best in the bootleg but they had someone else do something else. This also happened in many other songs. The beats changed and it lost the edge it should've had. However, focusing on Pac's lyrics and flowin' the cd is great. I read a review that said people said people only like it cu it has Pac's name on it, this is true, Pac writes and raps the best lyrics known and people know that. Consider Pac's rapping in this I highly recomend it to any rap fan regardless of its mix mistakes."
5,M.O.B,"Tight 2pac aka Makaveli The Don Album! I currently own all of his stuff down to the books, so I know whats hot... PICK IT UP NOW"
4,"Great album, forgettable second disc","2Pac's ""Until the End of Time"" is a great album. Songs like ""Until the End of Time"", ""Letter to my Unborn"", and ""Happy Home"" had me listening many times through. The only downside to this album is that the second disc is not nearly as good as the first disc and therefore, I will not rate this CD a 5/5."
4,Tight,"I think Pac made alot of songs before his truly tragic death. At first he wasn't putting out anything good, but with the recent Until The End of Time I think he finally made an lp worth coppin. If you liked 2Pac and the Outlaws then you'll love this one. But make your own judgment and cop this one."
5,u'll never get sick of him,"This album is a classic album (as his others).To me, i love tupac because of his words,because of his struggle,because of how in life he never got any apprectiation from no one.He made 4 albums and no love.Until he went wild with the all eyes on me. Then people loved him.But even then they still threw dirt on his name. This man was (in my opinion) happy to die. He was not appreciated by many.This album shows his spirit, his struggle and his fears.He talks about his uncle touching him, Now tell me, what rapper is man enough to say that and getaway with it?TupacI dont need to say how the songs are rated, because i never appreciated this album till 2 or 3 years AFTER i bought it.Sit down and feel his words(even though if it is a dum beat) and you'll love him.Buy it."
4,Until The End Of Time,"This was and awesome album from the late Tupac Shakur. BUt, when it was delivered to me, both Cds were broken in half. I was very disappointed. I had to repurchase this item at the local BestBuy store"
1,WACK! THE BEATS ARE WACK! LYRICS ARE WACK!,"WASTE OF MY MONEY. PEOPLE OVER RATE PAC AFTER HE DIED, THAT'S WHY B.I.G. SAID IT BEST, ""YOU'RE NOBODY TILL SOMEBODY KILLS YOU."" THE ALBUM DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY DIRECTION. NOTHING LYRICAL OR POETIC ABOUT THIS TRASH! NURSERY RHYMES AND TRASH TALK IS WHAT MOST OF THIS ALBUM HAS."
4,Six Years and His Lyrics Still Have Meaning In the Year 2002,"It has been six (yes six) years since the untimely demise of hip hop's greatest MC. Hip hop has moved on and 2Pac still owns his spot, I think it is pretty amazing that material that did not even make the final LP is considered classic material by many people. This album was arguably the highest anticipated - post humorous release from 2Pac, and his legacy did not let us down. Neither did his producers, producers like DJ Quik, The Trackmasters, QD III, Johnny ""J"" and Big Hutch provide great beats for this great album. A definite must have !!!!!"
3,Hard rhymes but no more beats left for tha illest rappa eva,"HAnds down Pac is that craziest, realest rapper to ever pick up a mic, bbut on the new album, he just got no one backin hikm up. His rhymes are real and hes good and all, but its all backed up by terrible beats and all that. The CD is worth buying just to hear Pac at his best, but it deserves better prodution."
5,Battery for camera remote,Purchased this battery from Amazon and it arrived on time and as described. It works great. It installed into the camera remote without difficulty and works fine.
5,used in a bathroom scale,It shipped and was received in record time. Exactly what I expected but at only a fraction of the cost I expected.
1,Dead battery,The package I received is totally different than the picture shown on this page and when I tried using the battery it was already dead. Guess that's why they are selling it for so cheap with free shipping. You get what you pay for!!!!!!!
1,cheap but doesn't last long,"UPDATED REVIEW (12/15/2012): This battery died after using it for under 1.5 months. I took a risk with the dirt cheap price and thought I would come out fine. The battery was being used in an exercise heart rate monitor where the original battery had lasted a good 6 or 7 months. Rather displeased this battery died so quickly but it does not seem as painful since it only set me back a little over a buck. Still, beware of short lifespan! Downgrading the rating to a single star.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I hate going to RadioShack or a big box store to get a single, small item. This battery is priced well, came quickly, and works fine. Not much else to say about a battery!"
5,Excellent service from provider,The battery arrived ahead of the published delivery time which meant the I could again use the remote entry for my car. Thanks for the excellent service.
3,Quick shipment & Delivery but Use By not printed,The CR2025 was shipped out on time and received as published by seller in different Sony packaging then shown on the listing. The original packaging did not indicate anywhere the Use By or Expiration Date which is critical for Primary batteries. Drop down to 3-stars as end packaging is different and Use By date not indicated.Measured quickly (without load) at room temperature the cell to have 3.286V which is good for CR2025 but without Use By date unsure on the age of the product.
5,Good battery.,Good battery for my timex ironman. The price was good compare to the watch repair shop at the mall. Highly rcommended.
5,Works as advertized,"The delivery was delayed for 5-6 days (probably because of hurricane Sandy) but the battery itself (In a part of the multiple battery package) was fine.For the note, I use this in my remote trigger for the camera. It works from more distance than with the old battery in."
4,Fresh,"What can u say about coin battery?;)))OK, its coin battery /Sony developed this type of battery & it considered to be the best /.I've got fresh battery's ""made in Japan"".Delivery was a bit too slow ......the funny thing that, sellers business is just a few blocks from my house ,though it took a whole 2 weeks to deliver. One star down."
4,Seller stands behind battery,"Unfortunately, this battery only lasted a few months. A brand new battery normally lasts at least six months and usually longer. I contacted the seller who is sending a new battery. Obviously they were not required to do this. So I've updated my review to four stars based on the outstanding service of the seller. Hopefully the new battery will last longer."
1,Blew up,"Replaced an old Gameboy game (Pokemon silver) battery, and it started leaking battery acid after 10 minutes. I triple checked and it was the required battery."
5,Battery for car remote,"works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,very pleased with it. it works great,should havegotten it sooner;does everything it is for,at a very cheap price,good value"
4,It's a battery.,"It's a battery. What else can I say? It arrived, not as advertized, but close enough for the women I date."
1,DEAD,I was shocked to see that the battery was totally dead when i got it so i guess you get what you pay for but i was a bit surprised to see a company this big do business like this.
5,Great Price,I actually chose this battery for it's price and that it is a lithium battery. I've had the regular batteries and these last about 3x longer.
5,working!,"It's cheap, it's working, what else more would you expect! I was charged $16 to go to dealer to change the key battery, now I saved $12. Hahaha...."
2,Poor shipping materials - arrived damaged,"This looks like a good product, especially for this price, but the ""original manufacturers shipping materials"" that Amazon used to send this to me did not survive the trip from China... the tree arrived damaged. The reason I'm writing this review is that this tree was not packaged to avoid this, and I would imagine anyone ordering this product would have the same problem. Beware."
4,"A must-have title, but don't rely on the details","Peter Plowman has done anyone interested in post-World War II migration to Australia a wonderful service by compiling this book. No matter what the name of your ship, you will find fascinating details here and often a photograph.My reluctance to give this book five stars is based on having discovered errors. Start with Plowman, then check what he says against other sources, such as the Shipping News columns for the newspapers for the port of call or disembarkation and files on many of the voyages held by the National Archives of Australia."
4,Good idea in theory.,"When it comes to box sets it is really hit or miss. And any box set that is over $100 has a bigger chance of sitting on the shelf for years than a cheaper one. Sony should have sold the disks individually. I think they would have made A LOT more revenue off this unit. I ended up getting a lot of the songs I wanted (20s, 30s, 40s) from iTunes. Just because selling it as a box set makes it convenient doesn't mean it will set. There are 5 or 6 discs that I would buy. But I can't afford nor want it ALL. Check it out on iTunes before you buy. It was a great idea and effort on Sony's part. I wish more studios would do these kinds of compilations!"
3,"good idea, too much money","The sample tracks are actually the first five tracks on disc 25 (even though they are next to the first 5 tracks of disc 1. There are over 400 hundred tracks- but only 5 sample tracks we can listen to- doesn't seem right.Many good songs- but the collection is way to pricey. If you don't have any of these songs, or not too many, maybe it is a good deal, but most people already have a fair amount of these songs."
1,I have no idea why anyone would buy this...,"Yes, there is some great music on this set. That is undeniable. No, I wouldn't even dream of buying it. Basically, to sum it up, anything set that places work by Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong next to the ""work"" of Will Smith or Mariah Carrey is an abomination that must be scorned at all costs. By placing art beside garbage, the attempt is to elevate the garbage, but the result is that it defames the art. The existence of this set insults me. I could just see the vapid Sony Music suits pieceing together this monstrosity--- This set, in a word, disgusts me. By placing the sublime beside the profane, Sony has insulted serious music fans everywhere. At best, this could serve as a thesis about the Kamikaze-decline of popular music over the years. Revolting. Go build your own record collection, don't let some dim-wit corporate tool do it for you."
3,A so-so collection of great music,"Yes, this collection has a great variety- but it could've been so much better. A series for the whole century shouldn't be held to one label, like most have already said. Maybe make it a 20 CD set, but 100 is ludicrus! I don't think many people are willing to cough up a few grand for a ton and a half of CD's which will take them a whole month to listen to!"
4,good,I was happy to see Bob Dylans work on the albums so many times. His work is truly brilliant but i don't know why they put The Byrds version of Mr.Tambourine man instead of his.
2,Wilson wails outta sight,"Dionne, Diana, and Aretha can do it better. Nancy Wilson takes her turn singing covers from the 60s and 70s. But unlike those pop divas, Wilson creates much noise without much feeling. She wails loudy on numerous selections as she attempts to emote love lost. It's clear halfway through this disc that Wilson is more comfortable with her jazz influenced roots than getting down doing Spinning Wheel. She does offer a nice take on Sunny, but it's one good selection out of 20. Even her Dusty Springfield covers, make you pine for the real thing."
