2,ehh,it's hard not to rate this dvd high considering what it is...but there's one scene where chicks are covering themselves in food and other gross stuff...pretty gross.this is the weakest of the dormroom fantasies up to this point.
5,Great for parts replacement,Purchased to replace used items in a home repair kit. Very useful and sturdy around the home and easy to use.
4,BB's Best ?,"Huge blues fan and musician.I have hundreds of blues recordings from 1920's to present and have to say I prefer Albert to BB, maybe even Freddie.BB has always been more of an entertainer & singer to me than guitarist.Not knocking his chops but even this CD announces him as the best blues singer.He converses between songs while the band keeps playing as he introduces the next, giving it a medley feel I'd expect in a Vegas showroom vs. smokey blues club.The crowd is great.This CD, in my opinion is far superior to ""Cook County"" which I reviewed previously.I'd appreciate any BB recommendations."
2,Regally Overrated,"I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the ""Ultimate Collection"". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free!"
5,A Blues Timemachine,"Absolutely one of the finest live albums of all times. I bought this album because it was listed as one of the top 100 guitar albums of all time in Guitar Player Magazine. You get lightning in a bottle here with BB King at the height of his powers. The audience is alive and you can feel the young woman hyperventilating and swooning to BB King's rendition of some blues classics. His voice is flawless, still velvety smooth, especially when compared with later live albums by BB King. There is the perfect mixture of BB King's introductions or setups for each tune, guitar, vocals and audience reaction. The sound is immaculate, balanced and clear. His guitar playing is efficient and his timing is perfect. It makes you wonder why more recent ""live albums"" lack the spontaneity and quality found in this recording. The only regret is the album is not longer."
5,Perfect Gift for Girls ages 8-11,"My cousin's daughter just celebrated her 9th birthday, and I plan on giving her this book, along with some other Nancy Drew books, for Christmas. I gave her volumes 1 through 6 for her birthday, and her mom tells me that she is just blazing through each book, because she loves them so much.It warmed my heart to give her these books, as I remember reading them when I was her age. I used to borrow one book a week from the local public library in the 1970s. Nancy Drew was always a great read.I think that we establish a great connection with our children when we share with them something that we also loved as kids. It's a joy for all involved.In my opinion, you can't go wrong. These books are classics, and by encouraging young ones to read them, you help the children in your life to foster a great habit of reading--one that remains with them through their entire life. I think books of this nature also help to make them better critical thinkers and better writers."
1,Deceptive and Not What It Seems,"I too love Nancy Drew but being older, I prefer the original stories before they were modernized. If modern is what you want, this one is great, BUT I know a number of people who want to find the old, original unmodernized version and if so ... the cover they show here is deceiving. This cover art is an older cover that was originally on an older ""vintage"" edition that hadn't been modernized. Also, giving the 1932 date is deceptive because while the original story was written then, this edition is, as stated above, an updated and modernized version that was changed around 1959 or 1960 (or later). So, for anyone wanting a vintage story, check inside the book first if that option is offered, to be sure you are getting what you really want."
1,NANCY DREW IS SO STUPID!!!!,"Do NOT read any Nancy Drew books! They're boring and girly. If you want a real mystery, read a good one like Chasing Vermeer or The Witches of Worm. THIS BOOK IS SO STUPID, I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE LIKES IT!!!!"
5,Dated Classic,"If you want to get started reading Nancy Drew, this book would be the place. Of all the ND series, I think I enjoyed this one the most. While Nancy and her friends' activities and dialogue seem a bit dated (don't forget most of these stories were written long before you were born) Nancy is a wholesome character who is constantly busy observing her environment and sticking her nose into places it may not belong. Of course, this kind of behavior is what makes a story interesting. This book deals with arson, stealing patents, and helping an innocence victim find justice.Wild bill recommends this book for mystery lovers aged 9-12."
4,More Pure 80's,"A good mix of great 80's songs. Since most bands from the 80's were one hit wonders (or really close to that), you get the music you love without all the extra ""filler"" songs you don't want."
3,Something going on,"Bought this mainly for Frida's song, to play on my mp3 player. It sounded harsh, but Jeopardy and Rock Me Amadeus sounded good."
1,Awful flavor,"I've tried all flavors of the bars and this is the only one I intensely dislike. Does not taste like chocolate (or if it is chocolate, it's a very artificial chocolate).Get the peanut butter flavor instead."
4,Good to the last bite!,These satisfy my chocolate craving and are more healthy than most. They have a very unique taste with a flavor undescribable
2,"Weird tasting - not bad, but definitely not Dark Chocolate","I'm a fan of the ThinkThin bars in general. Particularly the peanup butter and brownie crunch flavors. They're good for my current heart-health diet in a pinch. However, this one tastes weird. It tastes like coconut to me, my wife simply didn't like them. There's a reason you cannot find these in the stores, I guess. Perhaps if they could relabel it to describe the flavor more accurately."
2,"Yucky Taste, but great bars","While I love the Think Thin brand, the taste of these bars is the worst of the entire brand. While others might like the taste of the Dark Chocolate bars, I'm sorry I had to go through an entire box of 12. Try either of the Peanut Butter types or even the Cookies and Cream bites."
3,"Normally good, risky to buy on Amazon","I've purchased these in the grocery store, and they're (in my opinion) the best flavor of all the ThinkThin bars. They have a slight dark chocolate taste and a few little crispies inside...overall not too chalky for a protein bar. 20 grams of protein with only 230 calories is great! Unfortunately, when I purchased a box off Amazon, they arrived and all of the crispies inside were no longer crispy. Perhaps they'd been sitting in the warehouse too long, but I would exercise caution when purchasing these online."
2,Dark Chocolate was dry and crumbly,"I am a fan of thinkThin bars. However, this shipment was dry and crumbly. I was disappointed in my purchase and will continue to purchase thinkThin, just different flavors than dark chocolate. Could have gotten an older or bad box. Check your expiration dates on these."
2,"Crumbly and dry! I usually like thinkThin, but these suck.","I trust the reviews and so many people liked these. I got these quickly, they look fine on the outside. I don't know why these were so stale. Love the peanut butter ones. These were just painful, old school nasty."
2,dryyyyyyy,"I have liked other flavors from this company but this and the mudslide are so dry, it's a struggle to get through the bar."
2,Think Thin Bars,"These bars are shipped via the U.S. Post Office. When I buy them in a store such as Whole Foods, they are fresh and the outer coatings intact. When I bought them through Amazon, the outer coatings were melted and in some cases stuck to the inside of the wrappers. It is not a case where they were left in a mailbox all day. My mailman handed them to me, along with the other mail. Don't buy this product from Amazon, pay a little more and get a good product."
4,Filling and not bad for the low sugar,"I eat one of these mid-morning and don't get hungry again until 2 pm, they hit the spot and have lots of protein."
2,Wont buy again,"Bought these when they were on sale a few weeks ago. I did read all the comments about taste before buying but didnt think it would be that bad. I tried it out for the first time today and was really disappointed with the taste and texture, I had a really hard time swallowing it and felt like I was taking a medicine but it never ended. I had to drink lots of water to kill the taste and to sum it up, I would not consume the remaining box and wont buy again. Im sure there are better tasting products out there."
5,Chocolate Heaven,"Love the rich dark chocolate flavor of these ThinkThin bars. Their texture is almost brownie-like, so they can be a reasonable alternative to a sweet snack. I usually eat these as pre-workout (low glycemic) fuel though, relying on them for a steady release of energy. No digestive issues to report for these bars either--so they're very close to ideal in my book."
3,Think Thin Dark Chocolate Bar,"Previously, I was a fan of the Think Thin Chocolate Fudge flavor bars. (Well, except for the last 2 boxes that Amazon shipped earlier this year. Dried out crumbly mess.) Those are not currently available on Amazon, so I tried the Dark Chocolate.I am disappointed by the Dark Chocolate bars. They arrived in perfect condition without the heat damage of the previous shipment, but the flavor and consistancy leave something to be desired. I would call them Chocolate Crisp bars. I'll be searching for a new flavor, but I really hope they bring back the Chocolae Fudge bars."
1,"AWFUL, Chemical taste!","These sounded too good to be true, and they were. The taste of these is downright awful! I've eaten a lot of protein bars, and while these seem to have fewer chemicals and more wholesome ingredients than most, they sure didn't taste like it! Honestly, these taste nothing like chocolate and really just taste like maltitol..."
2,"Good nutrition, not very good taste. Try another flavor.","I usually like dark chocolate and chocolate in general, but this bar tastes bad. The chunky peanut butter is slightly better. The brownie flavor is also better. Zone Perfect bars taste better than these bars, but these bars are better for insulin levels. Try another flavor of Think Thin protein bar."
4,Great deal,"These bars are one of the best tasting when it comes to gluten free, healthy-ish protein bars. The free shipping is great and the price per bar comes out to almost half of what it costs here in Hawaii. The dark chocolate is a little too sweet, but free shipping. The creamy peanut butter is great. My favorite is chocolate fudge, but since there is no free shipping, I just buy one or two bars when it goes on sale in Hawaii as a treat."
4,Don't buy in summer!,"I like the taste, but don't buy this expecting a candy bar. It's really not sweet at all, but I still like it. The diet food claims are pretty ridiculous, this small bar has 230 calories and is a meal replacement, not a diet snack. The product loses a star for false claims.It tastes good, is a convenient meal replacement, and a reasonable price when bought on amazon with subscribe and save.Don't buy it in summer! I bought this a month or so ago and it arrived all melted. When it hardened, the chocolate was all over the inside of the packaging and it was a big mess. I'll have to wait until fall to order these again."
1,Yuk!,I have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon over the years and am a faithful customer. I love reading the reviews and often check them before making a purchase. I have never posted a review until now. I had a subscription for the Think Thin Chocolate brownie crunch bar until Amazon lost that account for whatever reason. I switched over to a subscription for the dark chocolate bar...I just ate it (had to force myself to finish it). It tastes SOOOOOO bad and leaves a chemical after-taste. I don't know how anyone can think this tastes good???? I am now stuck with three boxes of this junk that my dogs don't even want to eat. I just canceled my subscription and will now have to trek to Trader Joes to get my chocolate brownie crunch bars!
1,Ugh. Tastes like cardboard.,"I wouldn't recommend these unless you have to eat gluten free. They're gross and have zero flavor. I regularly eat Clif and Luna bars, and these don't come close to matching their tastiness (though they also have sugar in them...)"
1,Not Sugar Free!!!,"I have not tried these but I gave them a poor rating because of false advertising. They claim to be sugar free but they are far from it. Maltitol is a sugar which is identical in properties to sucrose (table sugar). The only difference is that Maltitol is only about 80% as sweet as sucrose. No matter how they are marketing this thing, it is a candy bar."
1,Wasn't edible.,This candy was so bad that I tried to give it away. Having trouble finding anyone who will eat it.
2,Missed Opportunity,"Wayyyyy self-indulgent. Diehard fans will love it of course. But the rest of us that liked the witty and wry lyrics of previous efforts will only be marginally amused this time around. The music is worse than the lyrics (I am sorry to say because I like this band) but they could have learned a thing or two how to make long tracks interesting if the band listened to Stereolab. THAT's a band that can make a 7 minute song. Calling the music ""dark"" doesn't make this unfocused CD somehow better."
2,I hate this record so much,"Considering that I'm a pretty big Dandies fan, this record was something of a let-down. It didn't have the catchy tunes of Comedown or the introspective but lyrically brilliant, eighties syth pop sound of Monkey House or even the dog-and-pony show feel of Urban Bohemia. In fact, nothing really ties it together. The lyrics are lacking, the music is not very compelling, the record feels forced...like a compilation of Elephant 6 B-sides (if you can imagine anything that awful), and I would be hard-pressed to say anything good about it other than, hey, nice title. It is, after all, odd. Your money would be better spent on the next Courtney Love album (yeah, it's that bad)."
4,Vintage Haze.,"I'm not prepared to declare the Dandy's new record a classic or as existing on the same plane as Come Down or 13 Tales, but they've certainly clamped on to what it means to be ""Dandy."" There is a sense of humor, fun, mischief, darkness, haze, and clarity of vision working here that is nothing by vintage Dandy. There is no confusion and the record is tightly arranged to sound like it is supposed to. It's almost a greatest hits record but with all new releases. It is at the same time comfortable and familiar, while being expansive, layered, and loose. Let's face it, the Dandys aren't about turning the world on its head; they're about taking teh world as it is and spinning it into web of sex, drugs, and rock and roll."
4,thank god for the dandy warhols,"you know those great albums you discover over time, first listening to the easy songs and gradually discovering the longer, moodier tracks? after ten years and five LPs I think it's fair to say every one of the Dandy Warhols' records is one of these. this is a band with extremely clever pop instincts and an obvious love for classic artists. but it's on the ten- and eleven-minute tracks you hear the Dandy Warhols approach the sublime, digging out the hidden glories of a theme like a baroque composer or a great jazz artist. ""Odditorium"" is no exception."
2,Very Weak Effort,"Big fan of the Dandy's and this review hurts but bad is bad. They definately veer away from the slick Welcome to the Monkeyhouse sound and fall back much more on the older Dandy's Rule and Come Down sorts of sounds. Problem is the tunes here just are not any good.Tracks 2 and 3 exemplify the problems with this disc. These songs clock in at 9+ and 7+ minutes but the vocals stop at about the 2.5 minute mark. The problem isn't that there isn't a vocal track it is that the remaining 5 or 7 minutes of music is aimless and dull. They are not experimenting since nothing here rates at the level of ""It's A Fast Driving Rave Up With The Dandy Warhols Sixteen Minutes"" or ""Creep Out"". This stuff just isn't very interesting. Other tracks clock in over 10 minutes and frankly there just isn't a whole lot interesting going on duirng all that time.3 years wait for this....well it is just sad."
1,Uninspired.,"My personal opinion? Track 1 is just retarded, and the rest of the album? zzzzzzzzzzz. I was dissappointed.In some ways it revisits their old 'jam' style, but the tracks just go on for too long. The first 4 times I listened to it I stopped paying attention after the first few tracks... bad sign. I'm still trying to get to know the album but I know my opinion won't change.I'm a hard core fan, I've been there since Dandy's Rule and I just don't really like where the band is going. Their focus seems to be more on being 'cool' than the music.""It's only rock&roll; but I think I LIKE it."" stupid. Sorry guys - I expected more."
2,"wow, what happened?","Did they get a knock on the head and forget how to write good tunes? Up until this album, everything the dandy's did was pretty good to great. This album sounds nothing like the catchy tunes they were doing before and it is definetely on the morose side. Very hard to explain, but this album was not one of their best efforts. I also guess it is hard to top the great tunes they preformed prior to this one."
3,Unfocused,"This is certainly the Dandy's most inconsistent and frustrating record and that's really saying something, given that none of their past efforts have been totally engaging. The first two songs (after the intro) go on for far too long and are just indulgent. Indulgence can be okay as long as you have a good hook to hang the excess on (see the longer songs on ""Come Down"") but that unfortunately isn't the case here. And to top it off, the last two tracks are virtually unlistenable. In the middle there is actually some pretty decent stuff, but no stand out track or single to compare to ""Not If You Were...."", ""Bohemian Like You"", ""We Used To Be Friends"", ""Holiday"" or even ""Boys Better"" or ""Horse Pills"". Still, that familiar Dandy's drone is intact and it's worth a listen. Difficult to really enjoy though."
4,"Not Their Best, But Good at the Very Least","It took me a few listens to really get a feel for this album. It seems to combine both the elements of ""Warhols Come Down"" and ""Urban Bohemia"" while still testing their limits as a band. Depending on your mood, some of it is even a bit annoying. Aside from that, these guys still know how to craft a wildly psychedelic pop album. Odditorium seems to sum it up quite well, this is an 'odd' Dandy release, but there is probably better to come from the constantly evolving Dandies. Pick this one up if you consider yourself an open-minded fan of them, just remember to give it a few listens before you decide if you like it."
1,I've given it time...,"So I've given this album a LONG time to sink in.I finally came back to it on a few of my recent long car trips when I had some time to really focus on an album.I have this to say: ""Ouch.""I would have been happy with an album 1/2 as good as ""Thirteen Tales"" or 1/3 as good as ""Monkey House,"" but it was not to be.I still wouldn't move it from #1 on my list of ""Biggest Disappointments of 2005."""
1,come on now...,"the warhols have become my favorite band. i even loved monkey house, which many of my friends didn't care for. 13 tales is in my top 10, possibly top 5, discs of all time. very, very fond of their 1st 2 discs as well.the 1st time i listened to this i couldn't wait to get it in my player. by the last tune i couldn't wait to get it out. i'm really not sure what they were thinking here. shapeless, formless ball of goo. this is really bad and unless you (like me) have to have everything they've done, don't buy it."
2,Long and boring,"With an intro with phrases like: ""this is a piece of history"" you expect the best album of their career, instead, you get four clueless seven minute songs, Courtney Taylor-Taylor mumbling through all the record, anyway, this isn't rock and roll, this is a band trying too hard to be the next Velvet Underground. 2 stars because there are two good songs: ""Smoke It"" and ""Down Like Disco"", I didn't give it 1 star because their career has been a decent one. Forgetable."
4,Laugh every day out loud,Light sayings for the inidvidual with a slightly altered sense of humor. this book is hilarious! My sister bought it originally and we laughed out loud til our eyes watered. It's everything you've thought and wanted to say but couldn't. I've ordered 4 copies of this book as gifts it's so good. Probably not for everyone though. Even better is Today I will nourish my inner glutton.
4,Good Read...About time someone nourished the cynic in us all,"It is an oxymoron that a practicing therapist says on page 19 of her book that ""Today I will play mind games with my therapist."" A good read. Fast and fun; however, volumes more are waiting to be written. My favorite(personal)...""People are messy"" Use with caution...Wells and Thornhill hit nerves with every other comment. I am waiting for volume II, like ""Friday the Thirteenth II...""Jason Opens a Conenvience Store..."" The book is as happy as a pet rock. I recommend it highly. Just do what you do best, the best advice for cynics everywhere. Kudos."
2,"Nothing ""Cool Blue"" about this product","I bought these bulbs thinking it would have a Cool ""BLUE"" look to my car but it looks like the same stock yellow lights."
1,NOT Blue or Silver.,"NOT Blue, Silver, or any other color that isn't the regular yellowish white you'd expect in cars. Calling it ""blue"" is absurd."
1,Deceptive,"I installed a pair yesterday and there is nothing ""Cool Blue"" about it. It's a standard bulb that emits that standard yellowish light and not the blue/bright white light that I was expecting. It works and that all."
4,A little Brighter,"I purchased both sets of Low/ & High beam bulbs...The fit was perfect, worked out nicely to my 03' Honda Accord. Brighter then regular head lights, but not as bright as HID lights...but bright and Less Expensive. If your looking into adding a little brighter smile to your car, and save money, worth the purchase."
1,Disappointing,"One wonders if the author of this book acutally has ever spent any time with victims of the kind of tragedy she writes about. The very concept of the book is bizarre at best and insulting at worst.Additonally the novel - which isn't erotic despite the hype - does not seem to come from a place of great caring but rather a place of self importance. The writing, while tight, is minimalistic to a fault and makes too great an effort to be ""well written"" rather than get to the heart of the characters. It reads like an short story experiment rather than a strong work of fiction."
2,Disappointing,"A very fast read, rather depressing, only mildly erotic, probably meant to be profound, but the writer completely misses the authenticity required to reach any kind of depth. Not worth the time or money."
4,well-written and provocative,I have to think that the people who've panned this book are reacting to the subject matter (which is difficult to think about) instead of the quality of the writing (which is very fine.) This is a beautiful little novel.
3,A Twisted Tale,"Claire Tristram's novel, After, is a slim novel that grapples with colossal passion. A man and a woman meet in a hotel for their first liaison, but the passion the propels the story is his, and hers, not theirs. Caught in an emotional tangle of love, hate and grief, the Widow pursues this man on the anniversary of her late husband's death. The adulterous man succombs to a sexual longing for this woman so different than his own wife. We are privvy to their thoughts in alternating chapters. His anticipation of an erotic encounter is immediately revealed; the Widow's expectations unravel more slowly. The union of two people with separate agendas is, inevitably, skewed and as their weekend progresses, their relationship becomes increasingly raw and disturbing. Tristram's skill in crafting this book is the way she is able to manipulate these two characters to depict the vulnerability, the pain and the confusion experienced by all victims."
1,"Awful, and not erotic","So awful it's hard to explain -- neither erotic nor interesting, pretentiously using events the author has noknowledge of, racist, insulting to women, take your pick -- but best to just avoid."
5,Perfect,"I gave the spice rack as a gift to my host mother when I traveled in Europe recently, and she absolutely loved it! It comes with the spices, which was super cool, and the rack is small enough that it doesn't take up much space , yet it still holds tons of spices. It's as good as spice racks come."
2,Broken,"I bought this item very excited. It was for my first aprtment, and it showed up broken. I was so disappointed."
3,I thought there'd be more...variety,"I was looking for some specific spices...wish all included were listed in the product info. In any case, these are mostly ""leafy/green herbs"" not necessarily spices. And random large salt chunks without any sort of grinder. ugh- Would have probably bought something else knowing these things. The glass jars are nice though."
3,Nice rack!,"Heheh... The jars and rack are nice. The spices are umm..odd. There are a lot of odd ones such as Pizza spice etc. I realize they can only ship what is available determined by the season at the time you order but Pizza spice? No familiar standbys like Bay leaves or Allspice. Whole mustard seeds? Does anyone actually use stuff like that (at least in a home kitchen)? Well, you can buy it for the rack and jars and fill them with your own spices I guess."
2,Disappointing Lids,"I bought this at Sam's for $20 but returned it. Great deal, but the lids are horrible! They are plastic lids that don't screw on correctly. Some lids just pop right off. Also, because they are plastic lids, the threading is very easy to mess up. When I looked at the threading of the first lid that didn't seal correctly, I saw that the plastic thread was damaged and smashed after having tried to screw it on only once! I intentionally screwed the lids on carefully and gently, but that didn't work. If it wasn't for the lids, I would have been happy to keep this product."
3,"looks great, some useless spices","This is a great product because it looks really nice and fits in a lot of small spaces. The downside is that it has a lot of important basic spices missing, replaced by ridiculous spices such as ""PIZZA SEASONING"". What the hell is that? and who uses marjoram? I'd trade that in for paprika, cumin, pepper, rosemary, etc. This is easily remedied by buying your own spices and refilling it. Very sturdy, not a flimsy stand. Rotates great."
1,Broken,"The item came with one side totally broken. I wanted the spices and didn't have the energy to send it back, but it was definitely disappointing and not worth what I spent on the product."
5,Excellent Spice Rack!,I ordered this because it wasn't too big. It has everyday seasonings and the canisters are glass. It's sturdy and of good quality.
5,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for a spice rack that wasn't highly expensive and had glass jars, which is apparently hard to find, until I came across this one. This rack is sturdy and very nice looking, and the best part is the jars are glass. Sure, there are spices that came with it that I am not sure I will ever use, but that is not a big deal as I can dump out the ones I don't use and replace them with something I do.... All it takes is a label. The jars are stable in their spaces, and the entire rack barely takes up any space at all. I am more than happy with it, and it looks beautiful in my kitchen!"
2,my spice rack was BROKEN!!!,"i got all sorts of spices i do not know, but that didnt matter to me realy, as i have no intention of purchasing any food for consumption from amazon, i was gonna put my own spices in them. but the worse part is that one of the wooden racks was broken in two, and came to me in pieces. this could not have happen during transport since all of the glass bottles were intact. if it had happened during shipping, whatever broke that wooden rack would have also broken a glass or two. i am very upset, and the worse part is i live in jamaica, as in the island of jamaica, so now, I CAN'T SEND IT BACK!!!! SO PISSED!!! I DONT EVEN KNOW IF I CAN FIX IT! SO UPSET!! UGH!!! other than that if it were in perfect shape, i would have liked it."
3,Its okay,"This is a nice peice. it looks fancy unlike most others which is why i ordered it and that part is a 5 star, but the seasonings are most things I would never use and some i dont even know what they are but they are nto really very different from eachother... so that is why i rated it a 3 stars."
4,Zapp1,"I received my ""rack"" last week. LQQKS and works great. All glass jars and the black sides and stainless top LQQKS great on my Black and stainless steel ""cooking cart"". Some of the spices I never use so I dumped them and replaced them with spices I do use. such as garlic powder and Black pepper and red pepper. I just went over the old labels with a black paint marker and it LQQKS great. Very happy with this item... Ü"
3,Praririe Home Companion DVD,"While the movie was OK, I was bothered by the the use of an angel described as georgus, I failed to see it. Overall: 6 out of 10."
1,Poor Quality - Both Product and Replacement Broken.,"When I received the first spice rack, I noticed that one of the black wooden pieces holding the spices was split in two by the screw holding it in place. I got a replacement from Amazon. When I received the second one, not only was the wooden piece split in two lengthwise, but the spice bottles had shifted during shipping and had broken the wooden piece across the center. I used the two different racks to make one perfectly good rack using a screwdriver, wood glue and common sense. I also just noticed that the top portion of the rack has blue glue sticking out from underneath the chrome cover.Would not recommend this spice rack to anyone. However, the spices did come in glass jars, which was my main priority. I would have preferred a different set of spices, they sent me 4 different kinds of salt. I'm just going to repackage some of the bottles, no big deal."
3,Random Useless Spices,"I love this spice rack because it looks very nice on my counter, and gave me the opportunity to use some spices that I would not have bought otherwise. However, at least half of the spices on the rack, I will never use. Many staple spices were not included in this rack. Dont buy this rack if you are looking for a comprehensive collection of the most useful spices, because it isn't."
3,not bad but not great,I thought the album was not nearly as good as the reviews I read. I like Knott's later stuff much better.
4,Suprisingly Good,"I was really expecting this to be one of those cheesy low budget films with bad acting, but I was pleasantly suprised. It had genuine suspense in it, and the actors did a really good job. I would suggest this movie to others."
2,received it broken,"this sign looks really nice. i was very excited to receive it. but when i opened the package, i found that one of its corners is broken. it is still hanging on somehow, so im just gonna try and fix it. beats having to ship it and wait even longer for a replacement or refund."
5,Review of Santa's Crash Bang Christmas,"I was raised thinking that Christmas was not complete without this book. It never failed to make me laugh. This is a charmingly illustrated, humorous story about Santa having a bad night on his delivery rounds. A polar bear and a tag-along elf complicate his evening as he stumbles from one slapstick move to the next. He manages to get his work done and leave without causing any major damage, though, and the family has a great Christmas morning without knowing that Santa knocked over their tree just a short while before. Kids and adults alike that I've read this book to have adored it; I read it to my own family every Christmas. This is the kind of book that becomes a beloved addition to the holiday library, right next to the collector's copy of ""The Night Before Christmas."" I highly recommend it for years of seasonal enjoyment!"
3,Card games,"This game was fun played with good friends, but when we tried to teach it to our teenaged/young adult kids it fizzled! Good choice for over 40."
3,Derrick Dissapointment,"I ordered a CD of Eartha Kitt which included ""Santa Baby"" which I wanted to use with a Xmas video, however the CD I recieved did not include this song, I did not use your return system as it was too late to wait for a replacement"
5,"Another wonderful Harold book, great for beginning readers","My daughter is a big fan of Harold books. This is another great book, and it's good for beginning readers."
1,"Terribly written, extremely disappointing.","This book is one of the worst aviation history books that I have read, the writing is outrageously bad, the perception is shallow and uncritical, and the author seems to be unable to reach below the surface of Soviet self-justificatory propaganda. Nobody should waste time on this book, which by the way contains no new (post-glasnost) information."
5,Dream-like,"This album has a lot in common with ""Warm and Cool"", Verlaine's previous instrumental album. The backing seems familiar, and the tunes themselves never seem to start or stop. It has the sound of a film soundtrack, little slices-of-life. The sound is mostly moody and melancholy.The guitar work, though is very different. ""Warm and Cool"" featured a deep-throated, Duane-Eddy-like sound, whereas this album is much more varied. You can still hear some of his trademark licks, but he is really pulling out all the stops on this one.Verlaine has been busy working on his craft. If his reputation as a soloist hasn't been established already, this should do the trick."
5,noir guitar,"In the early '90s, Tom Verlaine surprised fans of his edgy guitar work with new-wavers Television by releasing a collection of brooding instrumentals. Titled Warm and Cool, the album revealed the spacey, cinematic side of his muse, and introduced the New Yorker to a new audience. Now, some 14 years later, Verlaine has returned to this format with around, a collection of 16 instrumentals featuring his twangy and super-clean electric guitar. These include solo meditations, grooves accompanied by sparse bass and drums, and ambient soundscapes constructed from layers of electronically processed guitar. Verlaine's sonic palette extends from soukos to film-noir jazz to sci-fi effects-disparate elements he sometimes weaves into a single song. His music has an underlying psychedelic current that recalls the late-'60s modal jazz of tenor saxophonist Pharaoh Sanders, as well as the slowly uncoiling energy of Indian ragas. Quirky, subtle, and refreshingly original."
3,tv-around,solid instrumental cd from one of the greatest guitarists ever and most influential musicians of our time.
2,See you around,"After doing 'other things' not necessarily associated with music on his latest album, Tom decides it's time to get 'around'. I would have prefered 'in your face', but when do I ever get what I want?This companion album's virtue is it does not have that old Hammer Horror, 'Lloyd Cole Has Risen From The Grave'. That is, vocals. For which it gets an automatic star. Tom's previous instrumental album 'Warm and Cool' contained a track called 'Saucer Crash'. Here we get the follow up, 'Meteor Beach', which conjures up a sort of 'X marks the spot' Fifties Beach Party where young somethings come to hang out, drink bear and play some cool sounds. The trouble is, who really wants to sit around getting mellow to a lacklustre Tom Verlaine instrumental album? It's sort of surplus to requirements, isn't it?Don't get me wrong. Tom has talent to burn. I just didn't think he was going to use a petrol tanker."
2,Not Worth The Money,The video was ok for what it's worth. It was geared for the beginner metal crowd. There were no sections on foot technique or how to use double bass tastefuly with single bass playing. The filming was not that great either. Being a doulble bass drumming video you would think that there would be a whole lot more of his feet playing than overhead shots and above the waist. Save your money and get Dom Famularo's Pedal Control and use it in conjunction with a teacher.
3,not bad for the money,I purchased the Freedom Flashlight for a sailing trip. Knowing that extra batteries were heavy and unavailable in the ocean I thought this would be the perfect flashlight to own. There are two power sources. The built in battery and the shaking battery. The first one is much brighter than the second. Neither is really bright enough for long range viewing but in a room and up close it works just fine. I now keep it on my night stand in case of power outages. It's nice not to rely on batteries alone anymore.
2,Like the Sellers in the Temple,"""Jesus"" is further example of how crass the music industry has become. This collection of songs supposedly ""inspired"" by the upcoming mini-series is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on current hot acts and give them singles that will help sell this album. Come on! This album contains very little music that is remarkable. LeAnn Rimes contribution sounds just like something she'd yodel for a country album, and the 98 degrees piece is pure prettyboy nonsense. The album is not inspirational in the least. Check out the remakes of ""Spirit in the Sky"" by DC Talk and ""Shining Star"" by Yolanda Adams. What a hoax! Even the usually reliable Steven Curtis Chapman offers a banal, unremarkable effort. I hope this album doesn't sell well; truly inspirational music is worth finding these days. This collection is NOT worth it!"
4,Pretty Good,"This is not a bad listen. The real standout is dc Talk's ""Spirit in the Sky,"" but I also particularly like the Hootie & the Blowfish offering and the score."
4,How I wish I could have asked a few pointed questions there!,"This book belongs on the shelf of all students of the LBH battle. The trouble is that the testimony is such a tease. The tough questions were not asked, or not allowed to be asked. Larry Sklenar in ""To Hell with Honor"" in essence called the whole inquiry a sham, that Lieutenant George Wallace committed perjury to cover for Reno, and the other survivors who testified were just interested in putting it all behind them, or protecting the Army from a military-phobic Congress. I agree that it is an interesting read, but reading it is like a hungry man looking at a chocolate cake but not being allowed a bite."
5,BEST album in the WORLD,"This is my favorite album out of and kind of music. Lemme put it this way, if i was stranded on a desert island and i could only bring one CD, this would be it."
3,Yellowman always entertains,"Nice selection of tunes for fluff reggae enjoyment. Yellowman uses his voice as another instrument supplying pop and syncopation with the sparse music employed. Fun, fast, and entertaining... just don't expect to get anything out of the lyrics."
5,REGGAE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Greetings,Yellowman is by far the best Reggae D.J. that Jamaica has produced. I first heard him in the early '80's and since then I have not come across another who can top him. His lyrics.....that RAW beat.....well, you must have a listen!"
5,Awe-inspiring puzzles,"There have been a lot of puzzle books published recently. This is the best of the lot, and easily the best collection since the excellent Ultimate Chess Puzzle book by John Emms. Dependable Joe Gallagher has clearly collected many of these checkmate positions from his personal globetrotting as a chess professional, as the personal touch is evident in much of the chat. The checkmates are ranked on five levels, accordingly to difficulty. Great training just before your next tournament."
1,disappointed,When I received this product it did not work. The battery was tested locally and found drained. The light on the thermometer also didn't work. I paid to have a new battery installed and the thermometer worked but the light still didn't work. I notified the company selling this product and they promptly refunded my money. I must say they acted quickly and responsibly.
1,No extra's only the movie,"There is no extra's on this dvd only the movie. Not worth the money for just the movie. Love the movie, but there should be no comments about extra's if the dvd does not have any."
3,Pretty nice but old,"This is a pretty nice movie, more like a classic.I did not know that and bought it, it is an older movie so it will not shock you with special effects available in current movies...I would recommend renting it before buying it."
3,Lock Your Doors...,"The town Antonio Bay is about to celebrate its 100-year anniversary. However, its' foundation is built on an old evil curse that is about to emerge and visit the residents of Antonio Bay in a wicked shape. The oblivious residents are preparing for a party, while evil is lurking about in a mist waiting to strike. Lock your doors, close your windows, and do not open the door for anyone. The Fog is an eerie cinematic experience that will present some chilling moments."
4,"Run Away from ""The Fog""!","If it starts to get overcast in your town and a fog rolls in, you better run away as fast as you can. You never know if there will be dead fishermen coming in to catch some fish. The movie is corny, but has plenty of good thrills only John Carpenter can execute. Good movie. Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau are in the film. Who cares? I have crucial advice for a person to live by. Watch out for the mad fishermen who died before they were able to catch the 'big one'. I remember riding my bike as fast as I could to escape the fog one time. These old guys were chasing me with fishhooks and fishing poles. Scary stuff, indeed."
3,Not As Good As I Remember,"The Blu Ray copy of this is very good, but the movie is not as good as I remember. It is alright, but not at all scary and most of the effects are not much better than standard Zombie movies. Parts of the movie don't really make any sense, but there you go.Unless you are a collector of this sort of movie there really isn't much reason to spend you money on it; at least I wish I hadn't. Maybe I'll give it to someone as a present."
5,an unrealized classic,"THE FOG is easily one of the most frightening films I have ever seen! It's also the only film John Carpenter has made which evokes the same ""feeling"" HALLOWEEN gave me upon its first several viewings.The cast is one of the best ensembles ever gathered. Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, Janet Leigh, Nancy Loomis, Tom Atkins, John Houseman, Hal Holbrook and several more... come on! Who could ask for a better group!The atmosphere is rich and the slow, dreadful pace of the glowing mist makes for a splendid supernatural killer. Add in numerous shocks and unbearable suspense at the films' climax (Ms. Barbeau's attempted escape across the top of the lighthouse alone!), plus a coherent plot, makes for one of the all time greatest scare films, which frequently seems to be overlooked. Maybe if it had come out before HALLOWEEN it would have received more attention on the positive than constant comparison to its predacessor."
4,Understated. Comes back to haunt you later.,"This isn't great art, but it's a pretty effective scary movie. It's one of those movies that leaves enough to the imagination that you think it was moderately scary . . . until the next time you have to drive somewhere on a foggy night, and you find yourself watching for glowing red eyes.There are a few instances of Stupid Victim Syndrome--why does Jamie Lee Curtis insist on staying in the coroner's room with the boat body?--but it's not as bad as many horror films, and it does a great job with suspense. It has a back-story that mostly makes sense, and the haunting is pretty consistent, so you don't spend the whole movie laughing about what doesn't really follow."
4,CLASSIC CREEPY CHILLER! AVOID THE REMAKE!,"This is a very good ghost story from the the man who gave us ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" remake. It's amazing how effective some green lights and a fog machine can generate more chills than the over blown and boring remake which cost 100 times the money to make. This is a good movie to watch on Halloween or any late night with the lights turned off! I own the original release with the green cover and it is the one you want to buy if you can find it. The later one with the blue cover is the same with some added lame trailers for the remake."
5,Carpenter has done it again.,"Made the same year as HALLOWEEN, Jamie Lee Curtis plays some wath the same character with 2 other oueens of horror, Adrienne Barbeau (SWAMP THING) and Janet Leigh (PSYCHO) in wath seems to be a old sea dog's verison of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It is all about this fog and the revenge of a sailors's ghosts. A good movie to see on a night win you have see all the cut-them-up-teen-movies.1978. MGM. 92 MINS.Rated R for Horror Violence."
5,Carpenter shines,Incredibly atmospheric chiller from John Carpenter.Not quite as scary as it should be but this is still one of the finest horrors of recent years.I've always loved Carpenter's mastery of the Panavision frame and this beautiful disc shows off his fine compositions to brilliant effect.Great stuff.
3,Good movie,I really liked this movie with the doc. I felt I was taken through the film makers thought process and the commentary really goes into depth. A disturbing film. Good reasons to get the special edition.
3,Spooky...,"I think there isn't too many ""Horror"" movies that are not full of blood and gore. I liked ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing""...I believe many would put this one down because it does not have the tension of those two.If you like spooky movies that the mood/atmosphere carry it over gore/slashing than you will like this one...it is a bit of a slow mover...but is as others have posted only a ""Ghost Story"".SAG..."
4,An excellent creepy ghost story,"The Fog is not exactly a ""horror"" movie in the way most people think of them, and isn't that much like Carpenter's first hit Halloween. Rather, it is a creepy and atmospheric ghost story filtered through Carpenter's unique perspective. It won't scare the crap out of you or gross you out like The Thing, but it is consistently spooky and interesting, and looks way better than its microscopic budget should have allowed. I don't think it quite measures up to Carpenter's best movies, but it is definitely worth a look.The Special Edition DVD has a decent amount of extras, but the main benefit is the excellent picture quality and sound. John Carpenter's commentary track is OK, but not as good as his ones on other films, especially the ones with Kurt Russel where he seems to have more fun and is more interesting."
5,The Fog is one of the best horror film's ever!,I have been looking for this movie for along time! I agree with everybody!They should bring it back !We can only hope someone hears us!
2,has everyone gone mad???,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and trust me I have seen many! Phantom pirates kill and mutilate people for a piece of driftwood!If you're a fan of the movie fine but at least be honest with unsuspecting buyers. If your looking for a great story and lots of chills this is NOT the movie you are looking for. If you want chills without the gore try The Others.If your searching for blood and guts watch the remake of House on haunted hill. Both movies are so much better than this one!P.S. I gave it a second star ONLY for Jamie lee Curtis presence, and performance!"
4,It's About Time for MGM to rediscover this Gem!,"I have to admit, I like this film even better than Halloween. A tight script and worthy cast are both good for starters. Most of all, however, it is the absolutely superb photography and atmosphere (courtesy of Director Carpenter and his wonderful Director of Photography)that makes this one a classic. Most all of the performances are good--particularly Hal Holbrook and Janet Leigh. Only drawback is Adriene Barbeau as the heroine, who presumably got this role in true Sondra Locke-like fashion from then director/hubby Carpenter. I've never seen her give an unaffected, unmannered performance, including this one. Jamie Lee Curtis, from Carpenter's earlier Halloween and here relegated to a supporting role, would have been much better in the lead."
4,This is the Film John Carpenter Should Be Best Known For,"I know the film ""Halloween"" has a huge following, but in my opinion, John Carpenter's 2nd film, THE FOG, is far superior.Beautifully filmed and accompanied by an impressive score, this is his best film. It is a truly frightening film that addresses actual fear, such as, what is in the fog? If you haven't seen the movie, you need to find out what is in the fog. It really did give me goosebumps. Not many films can chill me, this one did though.Turn out the lights and watch it alone."
5,Rated *R* for a few scenes of graphic violence...,"to answer reviewer E. Joseph's query of why this film has an R rating. 19 minutes into the movie, we see an explicit scene containing violence. There are a few others. Anyway, the film itself is pretty good in itself. Not my top favorite of the genre, but it does make the list. I had originally seen this film when it first ran in cinemas back in 1980.Good atmosphere. I loved the scenic view of the lighthouse & the waves crashing on the rocks. Worth a watch."
4,The Fog: Enough said!,"If you do not have this dvd in your horror library, you are not a true fan of horror!John Carpenter is a master. This is one of my favorite Carpenter classics. The whole idea surrounding the plot is great. Being from New England, I could just imagine something like this being an urban legend.Definitely pick up this dvd to add to your horror or John Carpenter collection!"
4,The Classic Fog,"This movie had the right idea, but something is missing. Its not as good as the classic ""Halloween"", but I still enjoyed this movie and I feel its worth watching. One of the reasons why this movie still holds up is, there's no blood and there's excellent story-telling. However near the end of the movie, it feels rushed. But this horror movie is hella lot better than most of the Friday 13th movies."
3,"Good story, weak narrative","Pursuing revenge for what happened 100 years ago, ghost sailors terrorize a coastal town. Movie's group of heroes tries to survive the fog and unlock the mystery.Just like other Carpenter movies this one has an original story line, creative ideas and some nicely designed shots. The lighthouse, ghost pirates in the shadows and the fog itself are the highlights of some of these scenes.Unfortunately the movie suffers from an uneven narrative which hampers the suspense and the continuity of the story. Carpenter has a tendency to spend too much time on visuals and not paying enough attention to the story and it surfaces in The Fog too. Special effects also look outdated and inadvertently kill the mood. DVD comes with some nice extras which are worthwhile to watch.In short, this is mostly for the fans of the director and not one of Carpenter's best efforts. Halloween, The Thing or Prince of Darkness offers three times the suspense and scares than this one..."
3,"strong and scary, but a pot boiler","This is an elaborate production of a pretty basic ghost story. The plot aside, it never got past the point of disbelief for me: while watching it, I constantly felt that someone was just making it up. It simply did not sweep me into the narrative and get me to forget real life for a minute, it never scared me. Nonetheless, the images are vivid, the actors are good, etc. There just wasn't anything about it that struck me as original or worth the price. Recommended tepidly."
3,The Fog,"John Carpentar created many memorable horror films in the late 70's and 80's. Ive noticed though his music in those films always seems to be the same but in a different key but I digress.The Fog has a unique story, a great atmosphere, and just falls short of great. This film feels rushed as the film barely clocks in at an hour and half. The story barely takes off and its over. I still enjoyed it and it's better then more then 85% of horror movies released today."
5,a John Carpenter Classic,"This is just a great movie for all to see. It has an ""R"" rating, and I cannot understand why.Language - NOPE.Nudity - NOPE. ( Jaime Lee, tisk, tisk)Gore - NOPE.Violence - Not really. Read more.Somehow the mood of the film and the editing of the film successfully set up a book like quality allowing the viewer's mind to fill in the blanks with bloodier and more violent imagery than actually was filmed.I've seen this four times, the last with my 12yo niece who loves the horror genre. She agrees that the film is actually pretty tame but leaves a pretty solid felling of uneasiness long after."
5,carpenter's THE FOG,"FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A FANTASTIC GHOST STORY ON BLU-RAY JOHN CARPENTER'S 80 CLASSIC ""THE FOG"" IS IT! I ONLY WONDER WHY IT IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE IN THE USA BUT CANADIAN VERSION IS FANTASTIC AND IS NOT REGIONAL CODED SO IT WORKS GREAT ON MY SAMSUNG HI-DF SYSTEM!"
3,PRETTY GOOD FOR THE GENRE,"I have a feeling I saw this when it came to TV sometime after release in 1980. I do remember ghosts and a fog; that's about all. Picked it up at minimum price as I was on the check-out line at Borders today. Just one of those evenings when a ghost story seemed in order. Perhaps it was because yesterday, as I glanced over to a point about a half mile from where I stood, the tall buildings had their upper stories cloaked in, yes, truly, fog. Somewhat to my surprise, as the first movie I have seen in a few months, it kept my attention until the final stages; always the toughest part to script in a film of this sort. Inevitably, there was a bit of a let-down for me, though, obviously. not for many other viewers. All in all, I can recommend it for those who go for this kind of thing as a decent outing with little of the kind of cheap shot violence that takes the place of writing/directing skill."
3,Decent movie.,"'The Fog' is a decent horror movie from the talented director John Carpenter. He was the guy who created the original 'Halloween' movie and the remake of 'The Thing'. The story is about a mysterious fog that envelopes a small town. The fog contains a haunted ship. The ghosts of the ship are wanting revenge from an incident that happened one hundred years earlier. As with many horror movies, one has to suspend various logical flaws and unlikely coincidences. But the movie is driven my the suspense and an eerie atmosphere. The most memorable character is the female disc jockey who attempts to warn the town of the fog. The movie has a cool ending also."
4,Carpenter Rules!,"What a gem of a movie! It is very underrated. Carpenter has great mood and tension, as usual. More impressive (especially for a horror flick) is that it is acted wonderfully and I love the entire cast! Furthermore, there is not a lot of gore and most of the good characters actually survive. The Fog is a token from the era of classy horror."
4,Good Old-Fashioned Spooky Fun!,"I recently watched this movie for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a fan of horror films (not the slashing/gore kind) and I don't know how I had missed this one. Although the plot is obvious this one got quite a few surprised screams out of me. The movie does not show graphic violence, leaving a lot to the imagination, which is usually scarier than anything Hollywood can create. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. Barbeau and Curtis are excellent, as usual."
5,An underrated masterpiece!!!,"First of all, in agreement with others, this movie MUST be made available on DVD! I mean, it's great that it has finally seen the light of day once again on video, but what a great widescreen DVD (plus some nifty extras, right?) this film would make! More people need to see this moody, suspenseful, effective and snappily paced scarefest from Carpenter. His music for this film is excellent, the ensemble of actors are a blast to watch, the fog is creepy lookin', and this film features what is probably the most excellent final shot in all of horror history! I LOVE THIS FILM! If you like horror, suspense, or just a creepy, well-crafted film, see The Fog."
4,Classic Horror,"Ok...when you start watching this film for the first time (or read the plot summary), you may be thinking that it is not worth your time, and even I will admit that when I first started to watch it, I was thinking that the whole premise was lame. BUT...I found myself watching the film every time it was shown on television, and each time it created extreme chills and a tangible eerieness. One thing that definitely contributes to the eerie mood (as in Halloween) is the music. It is the perfect addition to a terrific horror movie. Watch this one with the lights off (from midnight to 1 a.m.)!"
4,"Overall, a good DVD","This is one of my favorite movies, I watched it alot as a kid (and was scared many times by my Mom, which helped matters). The movie itself is in great quality. A huge step up from the VHS that I've watched for years. If you haven't seen the movie, it's one of Carpenter's best. Behind only Halloween on my list.It's about a small coastal town gearing up to celebrate it's 100th anniversary. But, what they don't know is the story that lurks under the fog (pun intended :)) and the horror that is about to unfold. As the film continues, we meet Father Malone, who is a vital part to the story. We also meet Stevie Wayne, a radio broadcaster who starts to realize what's happening with the fog.It's a great film, I highly recommend it. The DVD doesn't contain a whole lot of extra stuff, but it's enough to satisfy. The movie itself looks great and the sound is wonderful."
4,"I've seen fog before, but never like this . . .","If you're looking for an atmospheric horror classic with great acting and a haunting theme, look no further! John Carpenter was at the top of his game when he wove this chilling tale of a mysterious fog that rolls into a small seaside town. Easy-on-the-eyes Adrienne Barbeau does a stellar job as a sultry-voiced disc jockey. ""Don't go outside! There's something in the fog!"" she warns listeners . . . and the listeners soon learn she's right.If, on some foggy night, you hear a knock on your door--especially a slow, rhythmic pound--I'd think twice about answering it. You just might yourself face-to-face with a sailor from the doomed Elizabeth Dane. And he won't be selling Avon.This is definitely one of my all-time favorite fright flicks, and I'm glad it's finally on DVD."
5,"correction on ""C. WORD""'s review",just wanted to let c. word know there is no time difference...1 hour and 30 minutes IS 90 minutes....just so u know for the future.
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A really pretty terrible movie that is inexplicably beloved, The Fog sandwiches one or two effective scenes between reams of plot exposition and corny acting; only the ""so bad it's good"" effect saves the movie from an even lower grade."
5,truly scary,the fog is about a small california coastal town called antonio bay celebrating its 100th anniversary but they dont know years ago a ship called the elizabeth dayne and its wealthy but ill captain wanted to come ashore but were turned back cause the crew had leprocy the townsmen plotted and decided to tell them they can come ashore and lit a fire on shore in hopes of luring them to wreck they were guided by an unearthly fog the ship wrecked and all the crew drown and the townsmen recovered the gold the next day but it is said every 100 years on the 1st of april the fog will return to antonio bay and so will the crew to seek revenge this storys another masterpiece like the thing and halloween john carpenter was amazing back then like his other movies the music is just as scary as the visuals this movie is scary without tons of fake blood its truly a great story with stunning visuals and sound the fog coming in from the sea still impresses even today any true horror fan must own this
5,great horror flick- this is what horror movies ought to be,"i am giving this movie 5 stars even though its not an awesome movie, i just find it to be everything a horror movie ought to be....suspensful, scary, mysterious, and keeps you watching instead of yawning...nothing stupid or retarded happens either"
4,A fine old school horror film,"Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th anniversary. It should be a great day, but it's gonna suck! A dense fog rolls through the bay and into the town. Not being able to see is bad enough, but this fog also harbors an evil that will consume everything that it touches. The spirits of murdered sailors rampage across the village taking revenge on the inhabitants. The townsfolk must solve the crime and rectify the mistake or suffer a terrible death.This is a great horror movie. I wouldn't really call it scary, but it is a bit creepy. I love the atmosphere this movie creates. Many old films provide a dark and haunting backdrop that is lost in most modern horror movies. The Fog is a classic that should be watched by every fan of the genre."
5,This May Be John Carpenter's Finest Film,"Well, The Thing is Carpenter's masterpiece, but The Fog is a criminally neglected great horror movie. Everything about it is perfect--the California coastal town that feels like it's in New England, the marvellously atmospheric effects of the fog, the terrifying but sympathetic villains, the themes of encroaching and inevitable danger and recurring, miasmic guilt, the sense of isolation reinforced by the sea, lonely ships, lighthouses...the ways that a terrible danger manages to unite disparate people...even Adrienne Barbeau turns in a superb performance here as a funky and increasingly distraught yet always resourceful radio-show host, trapped alone in her lonely radio-tower-lighthouse....i cant believe this incredibly elegant and frightening movie has received such little fanfare. This SE DVD is excellent all around and well worth owning."
3,the snore...,"this movie totally sucks.i bought it , turned off the lights, pumped up the volume, and then I realized I just threw away 20+ dollars to buy this.the only part worth watchin is when the old lady gets a pencil in the eye.so other than that good laugh, it sucks."
2,Do yourself a favor and skip this one..,"I just watched this movie last night because I was in the mood for a scary flick. I wish I would have not bothered. The plot is kind of slow, and very predictable. The acting is pretty bad as well (unless you really like Adrian Barbieu with a overly-breathy voice). Not scary, not entertaining. Boring, boring, boring. I can't imagine what people who give this a high rating see in this film."
1,Why I agree with last review and.....,"I WANTED to like this movie when I saw it, but it, like any other Carpenter movie that I've seen (and I have to say I haven't seen anything recent of his), is so full of holes and flaws that still years later I feel cheated as a movie goer. I honestly do not know how this man continues to make movies.::::SPOILERS: Do not continue if you have NOT seen the movie:::I agree, like I said, with the previous review. The mood is set, but why set up all the knocking without entering a place, and then he breaks that whole convention in the end with their getting into the lighthouse (build up of power? who knows).BUT..and the biggest but..is when they just POOF appear in the church to behead Holbruck. If they could do this, the rest of the meager set up makes no or little sense.This movie could have stayed on VHS and gone out of print for all I cared. Why write this and share? Want someone to save money and get a better film."
4,good movie much better than 'new' horror,"i liked this movie. its a lot better than the new horror stuff which really isn't that scary.the music is fantastic, which makes the movie seem even more scary. it is highly entertaining. rent it.yes the fog looks real much better than the cg junk out today."
4,Sins From The Past,"in spite of its low, very low body count- whatever happened to all that people surrounded by the fog in the beach- and some corny characters- the granny and the little boy seem to belong to a silly spielberg-like flick-, the fog is one of john carpenter's best, a scary nightfire tale of betrayal and community redemption# run-away-from-the-fog-there-is-something-in-the-fog, radio lighthouse keeper adrienne barbeau repeats over and over in spine chilling voice mood## avoid-any-not-letterboxed-edition-of-this-classic, veryolivari suggests anyone out there hearing"
4,brave step forward,"HYSTERIA was considered a faliure at the time as of course it followed DARE,but listening to it now it remains a strong body of work.It is a far more stripped back affair,which helps it sound fresh today.it contains The lebanon,Louise & life on your own all top 20 hits in the U.K.These tracks were probably not the best choices for singles,as The lebanon frightened a lot of fans away from the album(and it is in no way representative)I'm coming back & So hurt are classic League tracks"
4,jazz for none musicians,"tremendous sound, like being in a saloon late at night without the smoke, warm comfy feeling"
4,Great book! But I want more!!,"I've had this book for several years and I re-read it occasionally. It has fantastic ideas. Maybe common sense to other people, but I'd never thought of them. It's a great book, it's just not long enough. I want more info like this!!"
4,Peter Weir's Witnesses Angel,"I think Peter Weir must have seen and even loved this great little masterpiece. If you love both movies (and I do), you will see scene for scene the similarities...Instead of a badman, Harrison Ford is a cop. The Angel's little brother becomes her son. But the bullets hidden in the peaches, etc., the scene where she listens to his delerious ravings while he hovers between life and death in her bed. His very presence is a threat -- he brings the men who hunt him into their peaceful life. John Wayne is luckier than Harrison in the end."
2,Banal and trite,A western film before the spaghetti time. John Wayne is equal to himself and the situation is very banal. A badman in the west escape the rope by falling in love with a quaker girl who moves him out of his weapons. He becomes a farmer. A rare case of conversion that succeeds. Apart from that the film is too moralistic to be really an image of the west anywhere and at any time.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
4,Wayne the Badman,"Well, for those of us who are John Wayne fans, this is an early good one of his. I must admit I like the retro black and white touch."
4,Angel & the Badman,This is about what I expected in terms of the quality of reproduction. Could be better but not too bad. The movie is a gem. Well written. Well cast. Well acted. Entertaining. Gail Russell is a delight.
3,Gift,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my mom. I expected that it would be the color version. However, when my mom recieved the DVD it was the black and white version. This was supposed to be a replacement for a VHS that no longer worked and I was a little disappointed that it wasn't colorized like the information said. However, my mom still enjoyed the present."
5,A Classic John Wayne,"We have several John Wayne westerns on dvd, this is our favorite. It's an early one but a classic. The fabulous price and fast shipping made it even better!"
1,"Good western, unacceptable DVD transfer!","I ordered both this Roan Group DVD and the Goodtimes version of the same film, both available here at Amazon. This Roan Group version is of generally poorer image quality compared to the Goodtimes version, is not as sharp, has poor balance/contrast balance. It also has no chapter selection menu. Also, the Goodtimes DVD has a trailer for you to watch.Worst of all, and the thing that makes this DVD unacceptable in my opinion, is the extremely bad interlacing effect in the transfer. This causes ghost effects that are very annoying. Additionally, it is very difficult to freeze frame this DVD. The Goodtimes DVD does not suffer from any of these failings.This is a neat western (see my review of the Goodtimes version, also here at Amazon) and well worth the very reasonable price, but don't get this version! Get the Goodtimes version!"
2,"This is a great movie, BUT...........","This is a great movie, but do not buy this version put out by Alpha Studios. The picture is ok but the sound is terrible. Buy the Goodtimes version instead. The picture and sound on the Goodtimes version are great. The DVD cover has Mr. Wayne by himself with a gun. Check the other reviews for the movie description but don't buy this version!"
4,Quirt closes mens eyes and opens womans.,This Wayne movie made the year I landed on earth is amazing given the budget Republic gives these westerns.
3,A Pre-Review,"The 3 stars above are on the strength of the movie itself. I'm waiting to see how good this transfer is.I recently bought a different DVD edition of this movie (a ""double feature"" with a docu about Wayne's movie career as the other feature), and the transfer was literally the worst I've ever seen for any movie. It looked like it was done by pressing Silly Putty onto the film stock and then onto the DVD. Just wanted to give everyone a warning to avoid that edition.Other reviews indicate this edition is a good transfer, so once I confirm that, I'll give it another star.-- Edit --This is, indeed, an excellent transfer. I've tried to add a fourth star to my rating, but Amazon's review editing page seems to be having technical difficulties. So I'll just have to say: 4 stars.This is perhaps the only John Wayne movie in which another actor's presence overshadows his: this is a Gail Russell movie."
2,Kevin is great but...,"Kevin is funny but this dvd is not... The audio is so bad it's as if someone was filming on the ""qt"" from the audience and didn't want to get caught. Unfortunately, I got caught spending the money for this tinny, indiscernible, subpar, and unprofessional dvd... Amazon should remove it from listing... Sorry, but its really that bad..."
3,Just love this comedian!,Kevin Hart is one of my favorite comedians and I have a few DVDs of his. But this one was not as good as the others and it was because of the club it was recorded in. It was a small club and the audience talked through most of Kevin's routine.
1,Live Comedy from the Laff House: Kevin Hart,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of this product. The sound and video were past inferior, they were awful."
1,Not worthed,I bought the set a year ago and the battery is already dead. I can't leave them out of the charger so whats the point of being cordless. GE really sunked it this time. Better sell this division because is hurting the image I had of the company. Don't buy this product. If you have an excellent experience with a phone please comment so I can buy it.
2,Voice Quality Isn't Good,"I bought this phone because Consumer Reports rated it ""excellent"" for voice quality. Not! There was a lot of echo and a tinny quality, which changing channels only helped somewhat. I didn't have a problem with distance from the base, but I may have returned it too quickly to discover that."
1,Piece of you-know-what,"This phone crapped out on us after just a year or so. Caller ID stopped working, and it doesn't ring when people call. Total waste of money."
1,Garbage,I received this phone set as a gift. After four months the audio on the first phone died out along with with keybad and then the recall button. The second phone soon followed suit two months later. What garbage. All from a company that builds airplane engines.
5,Pizza Delivery every night!,I have a 4 year old and we bought this for her birthday she LOVES it. She has us order then brings hot pizza delivered where ever we are in the house. My favorite are the cute bread sticks. I have to say this set for us is very durable I would suggest buying it for the recommend age on the box. Our family gives this cool toy 5 stars!
3,Subway,This is really a neat realistic set but most of the pieces are to slick. When you try to put a sandwich together the pieces are to slick and you can't get it put together without them sliding out. I think there should have been more texture to help the sandwiches stay together.
2,DSST study guide review,The book did not have the content that I needed. I was not able to use the book at all. I had talked with the publisher of the book and felt that it would have the content I needed to review. The process of getting the book was perfect but I was disapointed after looking at the product.
3,DSST,"DSST SuccessUsed this text only for Ethics. Past the test without difficulty, however could not tell I was passing it while taking the test."
5,Love this book!!,"I used this book for a couple of tests. I was so amazed how closely the material in this book matched what was on the exams. If you are taking the ""Ethics in America"" exam, all you need is this book! I passed with 10 points to spare. Using ONLY this book. I also passed the HR Management,Personal Finance and Organizational Behavior with high marks.Before I found this book, I bought a used text book for Org.Beh. 500+ pages! Compared to the 10? pages in this condensed study guide. I love this book because everything you need to know is there. In fact, I recognized some of the sample questions in the book on the exam! I wish they had a book like this for all their exams."
4,Excellent Resource,"I used this guide in conjunction with my prior knowledge gained from the core classes I had already taken. I have taken and passed: Ethics in America, HR Management, Intro to Business, Principles of Supervision and Organizational Behavior. This is an excellent resource, Definitely recommend it if you're planning on taking any of the 8 tests covered."
2,dsst official test book,"I used this book for intro to business dsst. I used it along with 2 other books. This book alone would not have helped me with the test. The test was very hard. I passed it the first time, but I'm not sure I would have with just this book."
3,Decent study guide,Pretty good to prepare you for the DANTES exams. I passed three of the exams just by using this guide alone. I would suggest using this with some other subject specific study guides.
2,Don't make the mistake of using only this book!,"I made the mistake of thinking that I could use this book alone as a study guide for the Personal Finance test. I was shocked to find that the vast majority of material on the test was not covered in the book. However, I found it useful for the Introduction to Business test. I recommend purchasing textbooks recommended by Chauncey."
3,Business Mathematics review,I used this book to prepare for the DANTES test two years ago. It was an effective guide on what to study. I would not rely solely on it's content to pass the test. Additional resources are needed. I passed the test w/ an above average score.
2,The positive reviews are shocking!,"I took the Ethics DSST using this study guide, as well as others. Once I got into the the exam, I was SOOOOO glad that I did NOT just rely on this ""official"" study guide. It was in NO way all inclusive. In fact, it seemed to abruptly END shortly after an intense overview of the Greek philosophers. The actual exam went far beyond that. I recommend also reading ""Being Good"" by Blackburn & mixing that with another general ""Intro to Ethics"" type text.This particular guide is called the ""official guide"" to the DSST, but if it is indeed the ""definitive"" source, Lord help us!"
5,Who is Morten Harket?,"This album has some bluesy, American-tumbleweed pathos at some of its best. I felt like I was listening to a Chris Isaak album in Norwegian!It's almost as if this guy went on an extended tour of the U.S., along Route 66, and like...got it! But did he sell it to the experts on ""Bluesy, American-tumbleweed pathos?"" Nope! He exported it to his native people who probably loved it!The hardest thing to get your mind around with this album is that this is the same high-pompadour, ultra-belting, syth-pop vocal god from the '80's who cranked out ""Take on me"" along with many others, because it is sooo not that! It sounds more like the latest primordial release from Nickel Creek or something.This album has lots of jumbo folk guitars, mandolin (Morty's even seen twiddling one in the insert), harmonica, twangy-sounding Fenders and Gibsons,...the list goes on. Sure, it sounds like he's singing backwards English, but forget that, this dude has got the blues...not ""The Blue Sky.""Trippy!"
5,Matt Monro At His Best,"Matt Monro was one of the greatest vocalists of our time. Dubbed as the Brittish Frank Sinatra, his vocal quality, delivery, and style surpassed the ""Chairman of the Board"" and all others since. This album is easy listening at its best."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this product nearly two weeks ago. I insisted on a MiniDV format over Hi8 because I wanted the best quality images. Perhaps I expected too much from Digital but I am disappointed in the quality of the video it produces. My camera was purchased primarily to be used indoors and even with additional lighting to the room it still gives off a grainer, darker image even after a various number of adjustments. The quality of the images is less superior to images that are produced by a friend's non-digital Hi8 (Sony). Fortunately, I made my purchase from an establishment that will accept returns for full refund, so back it goes. If I am going to be disappointed in the video quality then let it be because I purchased a cheap camera but at the [high] price tag, I want something I'm going to be happy with.On the positive side, I can say it is very simple to get started using the camera even if you have never used a camcorder before.I'll try a Sony next."
3,it is not to shabby,this is my first5 digital camcorder so i was kinda hoping for something more powerfull and it takes excellent shots though
3,Cute boots -- Not sure if they are really Charles David,"I like the boots and got them at a reasonable price, but when they arrived I must admit I was a little disappointed at the quality. I love Charles David shoes and will spluge for the quality, but these seemed like knock offs and not the real thing."
2,Does not look like a high quality boot,"The leather is really stiff .Despite the previous person I think these ran small, not big. About a 1/2 size to full size too small. For over $400 you expect something great quality but these look no better than lower priced brands like Nine West. I would only get these boots if there is a great sale, do not pay a lot for them."
2,Boots run large,"These boots run HUGE. If you want them to fit,buy a half size smaller than you usually wear. Also, the bottom of the boots are extremely slippery!"
4,Handles terrian great behind my ATV,"Easy to assemble. I had to make an adjustment to the shut off mechanism so it would close all the way. Handles really well behind my ATV, even over some rough terrain. I had to bend a piece of aluminum (about 3/4""x14""x1/8"") and screw it to the control lever, so I can operate it from my ATV. I don't think you would need to do this with a lawn tracktor type mower. Overall this is a good product."
2,"Solid contstruction, doesn't spread tall fescue seed","Purchased to overseed my two acre hilly lot. Very solid construction and great tires; 15 minute assembly. To my disapointment, the spreader didn't spread tall fescue grass seed even when on a maximum setting. The seed just gets stuck in the small holes feeding the spreader. I'm expecting it to work fine with fertilizer."
2,Speader Review,"Not happly with the speader. No shut off when your on the mower if you stop fertilizer pours out the bottom so you have to jump off the mower and quickly trun it off and only holds enough for a 1/2 a acre at setting 7 for the same price you can buy a larger oneDonald, Marseilles, IL"
1,Paid for New but Received a Used Product,When I opened the box I immediatley smelled a strong odor of weed and feed. The poly cover reeked of herbicide. Bolts were missing and so was the tow bar attachment. I returned the product and replaced it through one of Amazon's competitors. No problems at all with the replacement.
3,TOW BEHIND SPREADER,"SPREADER WAS WELL BUILD BUT, I SEEN ONE IN HOME DEPOT FOR LESS MONEY.SAME QUALITY"
5,Serves it's purpose quite well!,"After searching high and low for a decent broadcast spreader (it seems this is a seasonal item sold during the summer and fall), I finally found this one. Although we don't use it for fertilizer (we use it primarily for spreading salt during the snowy months on our extremly long driveway), it seems to serve it's purpose quite well! I would recommend this item to anyone who needs a good sturdy broadcast spreader to attach to their garden tractor."
3,UNDERESTIMATED R&B,"This is a very good freshman effort from a beautiful songstress. Her voice isn't as polished as big sis' but she can definitely hold her own. The gems on this R&B delight are ""Tonight"", ""You Don't know"" which is my favorite, ""Words"" and ""Way it should be,The"" a definte don't miss song. Don't get me wrong the album is not a classic but it shows the potential of yet another R&B songstress. For the price and quality of the music, it is worth giving an ear to."
5,Tamar Braxton's CD,When I heard all of the excellent reviews I thought there must be something special here. So I bought the CD I was extremely pleased. Tamar has a great voice and is very under rated and under promoted. Hope when her new CD is announced under a new label hope there is more exposure . Tamar is an example of what music is missing.
2,where is the MAN in LESBIAN?,"I bought this book for my girlfriend and I to read together. We've been through about half the book and have skipped over probably 80% of the stories because they either involved men or anal sex. I'm sorry but when a lesbian is trying to get in the mood she doesn't want to read about men in the mix. This is supposed to be the best of lesbian erotica, it should be called the best of bisexual erotica.Now that this has been said, the stories that appeal to us are great. ;)"
5,That title doesn't lie!,"I bought this book a month ago and only reacently had the time to really start reading it. I am so glad I spent my money on this. I get so frustrated with erotica that repeats itself, the same story over and over again where sex is the whole point of the story and none of the characters have any more depth than the page they're written on. These stories are the best stories out of the Best of Lesbian Erotica series and the time and effort it took to pick these works shows. Each story has more nuances than one would expect picking up a book of erotica and yet none of the stories are so esoteric that readers wont find them a real turn on. This book is a great balance between art and the power of words and a pure exploration into female, specifically lesbian, sexuality. I would recommend this to lesbians and straight girls. Anyone who loves great stories, and bold, unapologetic female sexuality."
4,classic info.,found a lot of history and information on my 1957 wizard.searched the net and there was little info.very good book for a classic boat owner or a person thinking of getting a classic.
5,Rock thrown in a blender,"Reid Paley is as interesting as they come. Most musicians think of a topic for a song, and see where their pen takes them. The have little control of what they write, and they may get lucky. There are a few exceptions to this, and Reid is definatly one of them. Bringing together a unique form of soul and rock, Reid is set to define a new age of music."
5,Great achievement,"It's unusual for a book on this topic to be targeted at undergraduates. What's even more unusual is that the author succeeds in explaining differential operators at this level. I found the discussions on the Legendre and Hermite operators especially illuminating. There are numerous worked examples and exercises. The real accomplishment of this text is that the author has managed to select results that are of crucial importance, omitting some important theorems along the way, but maintaining the core idea. That is a difficult trick."
3,Covers the very basics,"This book makes a good fit for early beginners to partnership accounting. The main chapter contains material that is very generic and that may be gathered from any web-site on partnerships. Most of the material is very academic in nature, with significant portions devoted to exercises. A third of the book is dedicated to taxation and another third to liquidations, which are discussed in signficant depth. Nonetheless, if the reader wants to learn more about partnership implementations such as private equity or hedge funds, this book may not serve those needs. This book is best suited for a second course in accounting. Experienced business professionals are unlikely to enhance their knowledge of partnerships, unless they want to learn about liquidations and taxation."
5,Fascinating organizational study.,This is a really interesting book. Handy uses the personalities of the gods to typify certain management styles. It makes the styles more memorable and easier to discuss with colleagues
4,Interesting angle on management,"This book is a must for anyone considering a serious career in Business or Management. It provides insight on what to look for in groups and how they function as a unit, and the different management styles of corporations, government entities or universities. It will also help to identify which groups you would work best with, and which ones to avoid."
2,Tries to explain Organizational Culture in terms of 4 Ancient Greek Cults,"In my world, the mere learning of the existence of this book along with its premise was a powerful ""I-KNEW-IT!"" experience. So that is why my description of my first reaction was as follows ""provides a firm intellectual foundation for that gnawing feeling that your work environment may very well be some sort of a cult. ...all too often this all-important question about work situations being cults goes unanswered.""After some time to roll it over, I see that this book's ideas--though resting on a creative, relevant, and sound basis--are quite fluffy and weak compared to what is possible. Especially in light of books such as ""Personality and Organization"" by Chris Agryis and ""Love and Will"" by Rollo May."
4,gets the adrenaline pumping,"I listen to this cd when I'm getting ready to go out for an evening of excitement and rough-housing. It's loud, rough, and has a sharp edge. If you're into punk music, you won't be disappointed with this album."
3,"A few mistakes, but the only book on the subject","Noticed a few major and some minor mistakes. Over all a good starting point. Not as much information as I would expect from a book listed as ""For collectors only"", but it's the only one out there.Hopefully someone will come out with something better in the future. Untill then, this will just have to do."
5,Great history and detail,Just bought one of the rifles and wanted to know more. This book tells you just about all you there is to know. Helps ID you rifle and the history behind it.
4,I like it. Wife likes it.,"Bought this as a present for my wife a few years ago. She bought me the men's version before we got married. I think the women's watch is nicer than the men's. It's not a status-symbol. It's just a nice, elegant watch."
5,N-Toon's #1 Fan,"N-Toon's ""Toon Time"" CD is the best. I met N-Toon at Disneyland in Ca. for my birthday. They dedicated ""Ready"" to me. We took a lot of pictures with them. My favorite songs are, ""Ready"", ""Now You're All Alone"" and ""Do You Believe"". These guys are very talented, nice & down to earth. All of them are my favorite, because they made my birthday special.E-mail me to chat about N-toon or Sammie. N-toon-teen@webtv.net"
4,Sweet,"I ordered this cd for my daughter. She said it was worth it. She listens to it all the time. they were ahead of the game. Cute and sweet. I do listen to the song ""ready"" very nice song."
3,Very Theatrical Theatrical Family,"Together with the first Collection of this series, Collection 2 presents an interesting and, for a while, engrossing tale of the ups and downs or a noted British family of actors. However, after a while the high-decibel level at which the family conducts all its affairs begins to wear and I found myself losing interest in the melodramatic proceedings. It's ultimately a bit TOO theatrical and the characters begin to seem like caricatures whose lives are notable for a lot of posturing and over-dramatization rather than any real content."
4,Pleasant Surprise!,Another surprise from a band that I was not familiar with and purchased 2 CD's anyway. They are kind of along the lines of BNL and They Might be Giants (sort of similar more pop though). If you like that kind of music you may give these guys a try. Not my super favorites but I listen to this (these) CD's regularly.
4,Good purchase,"Is the first time I bought an used book, but I'm surprised for the quality of the product, it looks like a brand-new and for a very good price!!!"
3,Pretty but BUSY,"I hesitate to give this album only 3 stars because I tend to like music of this type. My complaint with this album is that there isn't much variation in dynamic in the songs....they are all pretty much the same...pretty, but very busy. I think the album would have been better with more variety of moods and tempos and a little less ornamentation here and there. Just my personal opinion...I just feel it gets tiring on the ears after about 3 songs."
1,"Boring, boring, boring",I never fall asleep during movies -- but I rented this one and was fast asleep within half and hour. Even Loretta Young can't save this one.
4,"4yr old son loved this book, I thought it was just OK.","His ""5"" and my ""3"" average out to a ""4"". We have 2 of the Pajama Sam games and the One Stop Fun Shop, and we love those products. This book was ok, but not stellar, IMO. But then, I'm not 4 years old, am I?"
5,Great Knife!,"This is a replacement for the Needs Work that I lost. Have always loved the Kershaw knives to begin with. Great knife, great company!"
1,This Was Really Bad!,"If you are reading this bad review and look at the others which are bad and still think ""Hey, forget what they say, I bet it'll be a good movie,"" Don't count on it. When I read the reviews I wanted to see the film for myself first. when I saw it the reviews were correct. This sucked! All they did was talk, talk, talk ,talk,talk, talk, talk. And there was this stupid sentence which stayed right in the middle of the movie saying Property of Retarded Films or something like that. Anyway trust me. I know and I was in the same position you were in. This movie sucked. If you don't believe me rent or borrow it and see it yourself."
1,Laughably bad.,"I heard this one sucked. The Foywonder and Dr Gore tried to get that message thru, but it didn't work with me, as usual. So I rented it. And I'm sorry.Some nutcase tries to transport two Chupacabras, a male and a female, to a facility in some gang-infested city in Mexico. At least, I think it's a gang-infested city in Mexico. Anyways, the male escapes and starts killing people.It seems appearant to me that most of the film's budget went into making the two rubber Chupacabra suits, which are easily the best thing about this movie. But that isn't saying much. To say the script and direction are completely incoherant is an understatement. The acting isn't much better.If you did something wrong and feel like you need to punish yourself, or if you want to torture someone, this is a good choice."
2,El Cheap-o-cabra...,"We get an animal control officer, his cousin, an author, two idiot cops, three seemingly harmless gang members, a mad scientist, his henchman, and a homeless person. I left out a couple of people, but you get the picture. This is low-low budget film-making at it's... er, um, best? Well, it's not the worst I've seen anyway. The title creature is semi-impressive w/ no zippers I could detect. Just some poor guy in a monkey-man suit hopping around. There is blood, intestines, and carnage, though there's not much suspense. The humor is ham-fisted and mostly flops on the floor. I didn't fall asleep, but I did check the clock to see if time had actually stood still at one point. If you enjoy movies like ASTRO ZOMBIES or CORPSE GRINDERS, the style and cheapness of EL CHUPACABRA might appeal to you (although both AZ and CG are superior tales)..."
1,Snotty film student weighs in...,"Great effort for a movie with a budget smaller than Blair Witch - I hope. The camera shaking added to tension - good call on the part of the Director. Very creative shots. Cameraman needs V8. (...) Don't let your sibling watch, they'll be too afraid to take out the trash. (...)"
3,bobs review,the video had some good footage of a chase and you learn a lot more about the chupacabra from this video.
4,Excellent source of practical advice,"I was really impressed with this book. I've read a quite few books on the business of photography lately, and along with Lou Jacob's ""The Big Picture"" I think this book should be essential reading for all commercial photographers.I found the chapters on promotion, networking, sales technique and debt collection extremely useful. However I didn't give this book 5 stars because I found the authors stance on copyright a bit limp wristed (i.e. you can licence images for exclusive unlimited use, in perpetuity - so why would you ever need to hand over copyright?) and the advice on writing your own terms and conditions just seems down right dangerous.Other than that I think ""The Real Business of Photography"" is brilliant!"
5,The one essential Photography Business Guide,"Weisgrau's book, compiled with the American Society of Media Photographers is a non-BS guide and a must for any student or working photographer. With his years of experience, he has put together a comprehensive guide covering everything from strategic planning to copyright registration.It is well written, easily understandable, and provides even the most experienced pro with current tnformation. This is the book to have. It provides not just the legal details, but inspires long range thinking for the professional photographer .Leif Skoogfors"
5,Very useful tool!,"This book has really set my wheels in motion for fine tuning my photography business approach. Though I've had a successful studio for 22 years, this book has so many good business ideas and details, I can really apply it directly to my operation. The deal negotiation analysis is fascinating, and based on real-life situations. Thanks for a great reference source!!"
3,Fast Service but package was ripped open,"Overall a great company to buy from! I received the book really fast and in good condition BUT the packaging was cut open and the book was barely in the package due to the gaping hole. My invoice was also missing from the order.Other than that I have no issue with the quality of the book or service. Would have given 5 stars, if invoice was present and package wasnt cut or torn open around the book."
4,"Great Dance Techno... But,","This cd has 9 tracks and they have listed it as a Single?1. Shamen 7"" Edit (3:45)2. Beatmasters 7"" Edit (3:49)3. Shamen 12"" Mix (6:25)4. Youth Transhamen Ritual Mix (6:00)5. Justin Robertson Lion Club Rock Dub (5:05)6. Shamen Dub (3:41)7. Beatmasters Tribal Buzz Mix (4:00)RE: EVOLUTION8. Shamen Vocal Mix (8:21)9. Live at the Warfield (8:25)"
5,Life Changing. A must read!,"This book had such a profound affect on me that I had to buy several and pass them out to friends. I know the book is old...but the philosophy of the book is timeless...like the bible. And it is written in simple English, and the author even gives examples that the reader can relate to. I know so many people that if they simply took the time to read this book it would open their eyes."
3,A good general overview,"A survey of fetish work. As a result it doesn't hold together like a single photographer's work would, for example, the book jarringly jumps from black and white , to color, and back again, and the subject matter varies from the ordinary to the unusual. If you're looking for the high-style of a Joel Peter Witkin, this isn't your book."
5,Very Nicely Done,This is a book which will appeal to most anyone. Brilliant photography from a selection of top artists. I really enjoyed it.
2,Great Cover Shot,One of the best cover shots of all time(responsible for the two star rating). Unfortunately that's about it.
5,Small but works like full size,I'll keep it simple. Lots of neat bells and whistles. Small camcorder that works like full size VHS. Has a nice adaptor for the VHS VCR. I tried other camcorders and full size VHS cameras before I bought this one and it was the closest to working like a full size camera. It is very light weight even with the battery on it. Your arm does't get tired from holding it up. It is also nice to have the LCD when you want to tape your whole family you don't have to look in the view finder to be sure it's lined up right. You just turn the LCD screen to face the front of the camera.
4,The best (I think) Camcorder in the World,"This camera is very easy to use once you read a few pages of the instruction booklet. It's great for Weddings or Special Days. Very easy to use. The only thing wrong with it, I wish it had a little more digital zoom."
1,Buyer beware--Expires in 3 months!!!,"I purchased this to use as a diaper cream, and it works fine for that purpose. However, I purchased this item in late July, 2012, and the expiration date on the product is November 2012! That's cutting it really close since the ingredients should have a much longer shelf life. This tells me the seller is keeping a lot of old product...try another seller!!!"
5,good stuff,i have been useing zinc oxide since forever and was very happy to find this product.as i couldnt get it locally
1,lengthy but lacking,"Unfortunately this doesnt give enough basics and shows very little structure in its outline.Few diagramns that are really instructional.Strong on safety and danger but little direction to the beginning kitesurfer.It seemed more like the dialogue that a instructor would give you through a series of lessons and in that context would most likely be excellent.I have been kitesurfing for about 5 months and can ride a board in and out - so I'm still learning alot but found the thrust of the book not really helpful.With the amount of experience the author has,he would have a huge lot more to offer and perhaps may do next time."
2,Not what I expected!,My daughter recieved this game for her 4th birthday. She is a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan so this was the perfect gift for her. Unfortunately the colorforms are hard to work with. The game board never layed flat and the game was very simple. My biggest problem with this game is that the colorforms are not able to stick back on the original sheet so you end up with a box of little pieces that you must go through everytime you play the game. This went from her favorite game when she first received it to not being played with at all.
2,Not so happy,This game was a real let down. We wasnt able to finish a game because the matt was so bumpy the pieces wouldn't sit on the matt becasue its a plastic sheet thats folded in the box. I have to find away to iron the matt and each time we play the game I will have to flatten the matt to play which is extra work I wasn't prepaird for. I dissapointment for my 3 year old who got this from santa.
3,Not so bad,This game is great other than the board not laying flat. Great idea and lots of fun for 4-6 year olds.
4,Very interesting lady!,"I found this book to be a very interesting story told on a very personal level. It was written in a style that felt like a conversation over tea at an outside cafe. The stories weave through time periods reflecting great moments, relationships and changes within the world surrounding the author."
3,Didn't last any longer than original,I bought this part a year and a half ago to replace my Apple battery for my Powerbook G4 which wasn't holding a charge as long as it used to. Initially it lasted a lot longer than my old battery however after about a month its lifetime shortened disappointedly. It's possible that they may have improved their product to support their claims since then.
3,Almost the Same as the Apple Battery,"I bought this hoping to extend the battery life of my PowerBook and the battery performs well, but doesn't seem to really last any longer than the standard Apple battery. It also was a tight fit in the battery slot. Overall, it works ok, but not sure my laptop lasts any longer."
1,Barney Could Sing This Song,"This song is just whatever. Your typical Lil Jon production and you know all of his music sounds the same. I mean, picture Barney or Baby Bop singing ""Snap Yo Fingers."""
4,Good toy for 6 year old.,My 6 year old daughter really enjoys playing with this toy. She takes it everywhere she goes. I only wish you could adjust the volume to turn it down sometimes.
5,Too cute if your child loves Toy Story!!,"Is what I would call a ""mental matching game"".. Match the voices to the characters. & My toddler son loves hearing Woody & My. Potato head's voices, etc. It's a cute toy."
2,couldn't ever figure it out,my daughter still has it after yrs so its durable but we really never figured this game out - and my husband and i are both have bachelors
2,My first VTM novel...,"and I don't think I'll read another. I've read a lot of great suspense/murder mystery novels in my time but this was certainly not one of them. I didn't find the story suspenseful at all, almost boring really. And all the grammar and punctuation errors drove me NUTS! With all the great reviews I expected much more and was thoroughly disappointed."
4,"Loved ""The Shadow of Her Smile"" By Victoria Taylor Murray!","I am liking this fun writer more and more. VTM writes for fun and her stories reflect it.Like most readers who followed this writer's popular Lambert series (and enjoyed it by the way), will love her newest offering ""The Shadow of Her Smile,"" just as much if not more. I personally liked it more. I thought Ms. Murray toned down the heat just a tad and upped the suspense a few notches which made the reading experience more enjoyable for me. I believe in doing this she has earned herself a whole new group of readers which will also become fans.The new approach to romantic suspense really worked for me. KUDDOS Ms. Murray on a job well done!I anxiously await your next novel which I understand will be released sometime in June. I look forward to it."
5,PLEASURE READING with a capital P ... HOT!,"My wife and I like this author very much. Victoria Taylor Murray writes a good, steamy love story and is great at weaving murder and mystery into the plot. After a long day's work, we enjoy steaming in the hot tub, then relaxing in bed with a VTM book. Yes, we take turns reading to each other, like a couple of newlyweds.We recommend this book and her Lambert series also. I hear she has a cookbook out, too, and since I'm the best cook in the family, I'll probably get that one next, but I guarantee, I won't be reading it in bed.Meanwhile, pick this one up. Bob the plumber says!!!"
5,I just discovered this author. Loved this book ...,"I've always been a romance reader, but my general fare is Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts, so when my sister told me all about this author and how good her romantic suspense stories are, I was skeptical at first.I decided to buy her stand-alone book ... just in case I didn't enjoy VTM's style as much as my sister did. But that turned out NOT to be a problem. I adored this book and its glitzy characters, as you can tell by my name title. LOL ...And that cop is to die for!So now it's back to the shopping cart to toss in her Lambert series. Thanks, Victoria, for a wonderful reading adventure. Keep up the good work."
4,My first but not my last Victoria Taylor Murray novel!,The Shadow of Her Smile by Victoria Taylor Murray was my first novel by this fun writer BUT it will most certainly not be my last!I loved the characters Corbin Douglas and Nikki Rourke. I could actually feel the spark they shared upon seeing each other for the first time.I also got lost in the FUN plot of the story line. I believe any reader who enjoys a fun way to spend an afternoon will love getting lost in this book.I look forward to reading this writer's other books.
3,the author: a crook,"The book is a mediocre. The author spent most time attacking others. The key things can be finished in 10 pages.I also subscribed the author's ""Over the shoulder"". It turned out he gave conflicting info. For example, on 10/9/08, he advised to sell all the 401K if still holding because he thought market will still be down for 25-40%. The next day, 10/10/08, he sold his own bear funds because he estimated a rebounce of the market. He gave readers different advice other than he actually does.I gave 3 stars because I still would like to test what is written in the book. With the time going on, the book may turn out to be a ""look-back"" and worth nothing."
1,For all those one star fans,"Many of you like me, look for one star reviews before buying a book. Here is what I have to say. The book's advise can be given in 10 pages. Most of the chapters of this book are a waste. The language is rubbish and the author's commodity trading company was banned in 1992.Here is the rest of the story. The book protects me from every financial disaster. The book has saved me tens of thousand dollars. You will not get the advise worth 10 pages from this book anywhere else. Now if that tells you anything..."
4,Worth the Read,"A well written book covering investing in no load mutual funds and a list of DONT""S visa vi investing. The author has a method for getting out of the stock market at the right time. Emphasis on taking profits and limiting one's losses. Easy to read."
3,half baked method,"The author claimed his system (40 week or 200 day SMA trend) worked without losing trades for some mutual funds. My own testing shows that while it does catch the big trends, it has a lot of whipsaws in the middle. The whipsaws eat up your profits and the end results are 4-5% not 12-19% return per year. It did better if you included the 10+ year bull market before 2000.The principles work though. But some filters to reduce the whipsaws are required. Wyckoff's technique is what I currently testing (it is a tough job since it involves point and figure charts and targets etc to remove low reward/risk signals).But the principle is golden: If it don't (NOT doesn't) go up, don't buy it."
5,Al Thomas is on OUR side...,"This book is distilled from Al Thomas' extensive experience as a stock and commodities trader and a personal investor. He is refreshingly frank and straight forward in his assessment of the markets and the market makers on Wall Street. His formula for success with investments is endorsed by his own personal wealth accumulation. Therefore he doesn't need to repeat the usual mantras of the Street, but he tells it like it is...for our benefit as small time investors. This book is an easy read and full of helpful tips. All the pitfalls out there are explained and documented. He shows us what not to do and how to trade mutual funds successfully. Thanks Al!"
5,This book has made me money and saved me money,"A couple of years ago I came into enough money to start an investment account. I found Al Thomas's book at the library, read it, and immediately bought a personal copy. Since then I have read roughly 30 more books on mutual fund and stock investing and none have equalled this one for concise clarity and practical advice. No magic, no mumbo-jumbo, no secret formulas. Just a method that works. This book has made me money, and more importantly has saved me money by getting me out of the market when things headed south. Plus, it is fun to read -- feisty and direct. All in all, a must for your investment bookshelf."
2,boring,Not at all what I thought it was going to be. Maybe because it's so old and dated now. Definitely not as good as any of the Bourne movies.
4,Entertaining,Overall a pretty good movie that only falls apart in a few spots. I'm looking forward to watching the sequels.
1,What a disappointment!,"These shoes were too small and looked like it has been used. The soles were supposed to be black, but they were gray. Somehow, I tried these at the store and the size was fine. However the ones Amazon sent didn't fit. Overall, I was very unhappy with this purchase; therefore, I returned it for a full refund."
5,The best sneakers ever!,"This is the sixth pair of Superstars I have purchased, and I probably will never purchase another brand or style. The arch support is phenomonal, which is surprising for a shoe that looks so flat. I wear them for both work and play and my feet are never disappointed, not to mention they are totally adorable in every color."
2,"""Made in China"" Docs","Had I written a review for Docs when they were made in england, I'd given them a 5 easily. They were rugged (most pairs lasted me several years), were made from quality leather and the look and smell of them suggested a superior boot.Since they started to manufacture them in China, the quality has gone down. The leather is stiff as cardboard, signs of wear show more rapidly (surprising since I dont run in them like I used to) and it's not just my observation but others as well.Considering that they cost as much as they did when they were made in england, I'll be looking for another brand once these wear out."
4,A quirky book with heart,"This is not a book for everyone. Some may find it silly or just plain weird, but it is one of my all time favorites. Simon proves to be an unlikely hero for the power crazed, business oriented Eighties. His innocent thoughts, feelings and reactions steer the reader through a rather adult story line. The A-CHOIR bunch certainly adds an adult theme to a supposed young adults book. The only reason I don't give this book Five Stars would have to be some of the characters. Names like Amanda Dollop and Philips Head are sort of hard to buy. I would definitely recomend this to anyone with an offbeat sense of humor with a taste for ""higher learning"""
2,Very basic old footage,"Best thing I can say about this product is that it's relatively inexpensive. Be advised that if you purchase this, you are only getting some grainy footage from right after the liberations. Audio is nono-channel, and nothing has been done with today's technology to clean up the film. The first five minutes is nothing but letters testifying it's authentic. Might have been needed at Nuremburg, but not 65 years later. There is some interesting, and graphic, footage, but most of the best footage has already been used in other documentaries. This is simply post liberation footage from some of the camps and not particularly long at that. There are much better documentaries out there on this subject, and I'd recommend them over this product."
4,Holocaust & Jewish death camps,We were to learn from this genocide. It was never to happen again and should never have been repeated. How little we learnt As humans we learnt nothing except how to kill each other because of our ethnicity in a more vicious torturous hideous and destructive and public manner.
4,Some NEW material,"Depressing subject that still must be produced - shows age, but that's to be expected"
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this item. I bought it for my grandson who loves to dress up in costumes. It was very poorly made, especially the shirt and pants."
5,most helpful native plant book I've seen!,"This is my favorite native plant book for Florida plants! I carry this book with me every time I shop for plants, it gives me invaluable information on where it will thrive, lifespan (which most books don't have), and common issues with the plant if there are any. My native plant class uses this as its ""bible"" as it is so user friendly for identification of more common plants and care. It is my go to book when I'm searching for a new plant to go in my yard. I'm no native plant expert, and this book is awesome. Yes, you can easily find them by common name too, it's just a separate index."
3,ok,"The slit in this dress is unforgiving, Love the shoulderless but it runs so small! Wish I got a larger size though. Definately a hard turner .Giving it a 3 star cos the fitting was awkward @ the waist."
5,This is a great book! Easy and Fun!,"This is a great book! With all the quilt pattern books out there, it's so nice to see something new. The author presents the patterns in a fun, easy to read style. You want to make every design! I hope she releases more designs in a follow-up edition."
1,Cute designs but terrible instructions,"There are a lot of cute designs in this book, but the block cutting instructions do not match up with the finished sizes. I have had to redo about 3/4 of my work. I would not recommend this book."
5,Very Satisfied,I am extremely happy with my purchase! It is exactly what I was looking for and exactly as described. It arrived in great condition and in the expected time. I would definately buy from this person anytime.
5,A complete workout that really works,"I love this tape. I'm a video junkie when it comes to exercise, and this is definitely one of my favorites. The workout is divided in 5 sections: a warm-up, lower body, upper body with weights, abs and a cool down. The movements are really easy and Petra (the instructor) is so nice that it makes the time fly by. The only thing that I don't like about this video is that the abs section is really really easy and short, but if you complement it with an abs routine of your own, it's great."
3,Manon Rheaume became the first woman to play in a man's Pro Sports,Her workout tips in here are very good.She played for Team Canada and for 3different Men's Pro Hockey Leagues.The Tampa Bay Lightning Goalie forthe Preseason (gave up two goals onnine shots) in their expansion season.Way to go girlfriend!
2,"Nice camcorder, poor reliability","I've owned a Panasonic of this type for about 6 years. Nice zoom capability, good picture quality. However, it is not rugged at all. Mine has had to have been repaired twice, and now needs it again. I don't treat cameras hard at all, so this is very frustrating and I am now in the market for a new camera. Microphone placement with this unit is poor. It picks up a great deal of wind noise when outside. Also, the unit has a self protection feature that senses moisture. While this seems like a nice feature, I've missed MANY pictures because of high humidity situations. I don't mean just normal condensation like moving from air conditioning to outside-but in almost any humid atmosphere, this unit shuts down. Very few outside pictures in Alaska or Texas. Overall, very disappointing."
3,"TaylorMade RAC Satin Wedge (Mens Right Hand, 60 Degree Loft)",I should have gone to TaylorMade to buy the same club. It was $40 cheaper at TaylorMade than at Amazon for a new club at either place.
4,Very Insightful,I found the Power New Testament to be a worthwhile addition to my library. It is full of cultural and language insights that bring the New Testament into a fuller and richer and more meaningful context. I will enjoy the Power New Testament for years to come.
5,"PHYLLIS HYMAN- THERE MAY NEVER BE A DEEP, SULTRY DIVA VOICE","SUCH A BEAUTIFUL ARTIST AS SHE WAS SOULFUL AND ELEGANT. SHE HAD TRULY LEFT A LEGACY OF UPBEAT SONGS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT TOLD OF LOVE BLISS AND LOST. I HAVE A GREAT COLLECTION OF ALL HER WORKS. SHE HAD A DEEP, SULTRY VOICE THAT WILL BE GREATLY MISSED. ADDING PHYLLIS HYMAN TO YOUR MUSIC COLLECTION WILL BRING PLEASURE TO THE EARS!"
4,I feel this is one of her best.,I believe I have every one of Phyllis Hyman's CD's. She had one of the most unique voices I have ever heard. It's very sad that we won't be hearing anymore new songs from her. What a waste. Her words were so clear and the songs always seemed as though
5,Excellent,"This book was a terrific read. I read the first book ""Island Flame"" and this book was even better. I can't believe the reviews are so bad for this! It was such a page turner, I could not put the book down. It gets tiring reading the same type of love stories, that this book was so refreshing in that its not the typical kind of romance that one usually reads. I'm a true Karen Robards fan that almost everyone of her books are fantastic. And I for one am glad that she doesn't write each book the same way."
1,Karen Robards could have done better!,This book and it's sequal was not to my taste. Very abusive (i.e. rape and threats of bodily harm). Whatever happened to prince charming in romance novels? This hero was more like Marquis De Sade.
1,Only a Sicko Can Appreciate this one,"If you believe in B and D, you might enjoy this. The main male character has no appeal for any normal woman."
1,I never made it pass page 100,I thought this book was terrible boring and I was not inspired to read it. I can see that others thought the same. I love KR. She has made some awsome books but this one just didn't make it for me.I recommend Forbidden Love....if you want to read one of her book. I really liked that one thats why I ran to get this.
1,a horrible book!!!!!!!,"This is a extemly horrible book, that I have ever read. The hero is not a hero at all. He rape, demands, and very abusive to the heroine. He cheated on her with another woman and expected her to forgive and forget. The heroine is not better than the hero. She let him treated her very badly and does nothing to stop him. She alway says that ""I will never gorgive you for that"" but she does in the next second. I defently recommend you to not to get this book if you want a good love story.If you want a good love story I recommend Julie Garwood or Jude Devereux."
1,So bad it was... bad,"I'm the first to admit my tastes often run to politically incorrect romance novels but this one even pushed my tolerance level to the limit. Yes, the hero was a low-down, insensitive brute (and, upon reflection, not too bright) but heck, all that could have been forgiven if he'd only ""given good grovel"" at the end, at least two chapters worth, instead of a paltry two pages, and very weak grovel at that! Seriously, though, his behavior was deplorable throughout the entire book with frequent verbal and physical abuse, and a redemption scene that's not even tepid at best. I found myself cringing a little too much, which is contrary to what, for me anyway, a relaxing read should be about."
1,A HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!,"This is a extremely horrible book. The Hero is is not a hero at all. He is abusive, demanding, and he cheated on the heroine and expected her to forget and forgive. The heroine is not so great either. she let him beat her and cheated on her. She always said that ""I will never forgive you for that"" but she does in the next second. I do not recommend this book what so ever. If you want to read a wonderful love story, I recommend Julie Garwood or Jude Deveruax."
2,It could have been a lot better.,"I love historical romance novels, and although I haven't read many, this was my first with rape - not just once but several times! Cathy's character was ridiculous - the love/hate thing was too much! Jon was way too insecure. Also, too much name-calling. I read ahead alot hoping things would improve - they didn't. The storyline had potential with all the travelling and adventures, but I will not be reading any more of Robards' books, since there was further reference to unnecessary violence."
2,What a waste of time,"I have loved most of Karen Robard's books and have given them out to friends, but this one was a waste of my time. I was very disappointed in all the fighting going on in this book. Either these two people, who were once lovers, have very short memories or all of their feelings were very shallow. I hated the rape scenes between a couple once very much in love. And Jon seems bent on believing the worst of his wife at every turn. I kept hoping she Ms. Robards would bring this love story around, but she didn't until the last few pages. Very frustrating and disappointing!!!!!"
2,so-so,"i liked the book. i liked the plot. BUT! BUT, the rape scenes were just.. ugh. But i still read it for the plot. nice plot. nice ending."
5,Landru returns,"In this e book series the spotlight is on Scotty and his early days forming the S.C.E. In this tale the Landru computer is reactivated and Scotty must solve the problem. With the help of his engineering friends of course. For all it's worth, it's a good story featuring Scotty as the star of the book. I'd like to see a seperate e book series featuring his early career after this one. Scotty's character can still work with modern readers.I have to give this one five stars and hope it inspires the editors at Pocket books to publish more e books about the original series era with our favorite engineer."
3,poor colorization,Originally saw this film in Black and White. This colorized version is poor at the best; spend the time and effort to find the B/W; the hokie-ness detracts from the movie itself.
5,Outstanding western,"This is a jewel of a western. If your a western fan like I am you will love this. I got this movie at the flea market for a trade in and I am glad I did, this is pure fun. James Stewart plays a man who is trying to find the man who killed his brother. And he goes to a town who is ran by the barb and causes him all kinds of trouble. He finds himself in the outs with Dave who is crazy and jealous of the relationship his dad have with Vic. He is a outstanding western."
4,Eyepopping cinematography.,"All I can say is WOW! The New Mexico locations are simply stunning. After seeing so many films with rear projection, CGI, and other obvious trickery is so great to see an outdoor film that doesn't fake it. The plot is adequate and the acting is pretty good - the only weak link is Cathy O'Donnell - who nobody seemed to notice - can't act. The real star, however, are the stunning New Mexico locations. Get a widescreen TV and enjoy."
1,Bitterly disapointed,"After scanning a few pages,it became painfully clear that this book did,nt reveal anything new about Chicago,save for afew shots here and there...Anticipating a fresh,updated ver-sion of Robert Cameron,s magnificent ""Above Chicago"",this book has too many steel mills,deserted beaches,generic shots thatcould have been taken anywhere for anyone to care.The emphasis SHOULD have been on the skyline and its hundreds of superb photoops.A missed opportunity,misleading effort,a waste of time..."
5,A Must Buy,"This book is a perfect gift for any occasion. I personally chose to give it to my dad on Father's day. It is a must buy if you are from the Chicago area. Terry Evans' photographs depict Chicago from an entirely new viewpoint. Above. The photos in ""Revealing Chicago"" not only highlight Chicago's prominent skyline, but the greater metropolitan area, linking the suburbs to the city. I am more attuned to the beauty of Chicago after seeing Evans' photos. The text by Charlie Wheelan is on point. By simply reading the captions to the photos I learned how certain architects had an impact on the design of Chicago (e.g. Daniel Burnham, Mies van der Rohe, Rem Koolhaas, and the like). I recommend going to Millennium Park where Evans' photos will be on display until October 10th. Viewing the photos amidst skyscrapers and in the middle of a beautiful park is quite the experience."
5,Beautiful photographs,"Terry Evans has given us another gem. The book is an artful combination of familiar images (such as many of the downtown Chicago buildings) and new and surprising views. The book depicts well the tremendous variety of landscapes we have in the greater Chicago region, from pristine natural areas to historic urban neighborhoods. Charlie Wheelan's text also tells a compelling story of how the region has developed. I highly recommend the book."
3,Very cheaply made but...,"...but it is adequate for the purpose intended (a mug rack) and it was inexpensive.Under no circumstances should you purchase this as a coat rack, unless they are very thin coats for very small dogs...no way would it hold a heavy coat."
2,Measurement would help.,"I wanted a hat rack. By hats, I mean Western hats. Wanted something to hang them on after I come in all sweaty, so the hat can dry.All this rack will hold is a ball cap"
3,Wish the pegs were longer!,I ordered this and got what I ordered but not what I wanted. I did not realize that there are two different sizes of pegs and I wanted the longer ones. I use this as a jewelry rack and it is fine for that usage but does not hold as much as the longer pegs would.
3,Just Okay,"I was looking to use this product as a cup rack. While trying to hang it with the enclosed hardware, all three hanger pieces broke. They are made of very flimsy wire, not the heavy duty hangers of past days. I was forced to drill holes through the rack itself in order to hang it. It is still very functional, but the hangers themselves are lacking."
3,A little expensive.,"I found another rack at a different store for only $4. Granted it was small, but not much smaller than this one. It was nice to have the hangers to hang it to the wall, but I wanted to hand it vertically because it would fit in my dorm room that way, but I have to wait until next year to use it.Also, the pegs seemed a bit loose, and the color is extremely plain."
2,OK for the price,This item is not as polished as it looks and the pegs are so loose they fall off with the slightest weight. I had an old one and it was so sturdy I bought this one. But it is too flimsy and I had to glue most of the pegs with crazy glue to make them stay.
3,so-sp,"Iwas annoyed to discover that the rack came with only one hanger to attach it to the wall. I had to go to 2 different stores to find the right kind of hanger. Since I couldn't find the exact model, I ended up removing the original hanger and replacing ut.On the other hand, it came in a timely fashion. It performs as promised."
1,How do you mess this up??!!,"I picked up this rack to help with my ball cap overflow. I have owned this type of rack before and they are so easy to put together I am sure they are user as Junior High wood shop projects.Having said that, this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. The wood feels like it is balsa and it is even missing one of the pegs and the mounting hook on the back. If I were to see this at a store I wouldn't give $.25 for it.I have never had the need to return anything to Amazon, but this is for sure going back. There is no way you couldn't find a better product somewhere else, like dumpster diving or at the swap meet.Expanding PEG Rack 10 Hooks Hardwood Multi-purpose Vertical or Horizontal Wall Mount"
1,"flimsy, dollar store is better!!!","Bought this product with positive thought in mind. Buying from amazon is quick and easy, delivery is a flash as promised BUT it came in a cushioned brown envelope.... red flag already! I opened it and out came this flimsy wood work project like the ones your child brings from school. I expanded it to check if it is working and at least attached together, you can tell how fragile it is. the knobs/hooks are screwed but it can only support a beanie/hat/scarf. You cant use it for jacket/sweater/purse.Lesson learned: you get what you pay for...sooo not worth $8"
1,Beware -- Dollar Store Merchandise!,"Ok, I read the other reviews and thought since I was going to use the rack as a hat rack that it didn't have to be as sturdy as one that would hold coffee mugs...well, I should have listened to the reviews. First off, the wood is not even stained or varnished. Second, the pegs are so short -- not suitable for a hat rack. Third, a paint stir stick that you get free with your paint purchase is made out of stronger wood...this rack appears to be made out of a balsa type material...Extremely Cheap. I'm returning the two racks I ordered. Would have given a ""no star"" rating if that was possible."
1,HORRIBLE & CHEAP!,I was hoping to get something sturdy BUT this is something HORRIBLE.Don't waist your time and money for this!
2,Pegs too small,"Seemed inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. Pegs are way too small for cups, hats, most anything that you would want to hang. Also the expanding arms are very cheaply made. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Be careful what you order,"On April 24 I ordered 3 Expanding PEG Rack 10 Hooks Hardwood Multi-purpose Vertical or Horizontal Wall Mount. On May 27, I ordered the EXACT same thing. Both items were of complete different quality. The first order was sturdy, attractive and worth the price. The second order was flimsy, cheap looking and not worth what I paid for it. The first order was sold by MMP LLC and the second order was sold by coolsellers4u. I was VERY disappointed with the second order."
1,Not worth the time or money,Absolutely useless. I can't hang hats on here without other ones falling off. Really only good for maybe 4 hats. Terrible. Now I'm trying to find something new to replace this.
4,expandable coffee mug holder,I love this rack. It is somewhat easy to break thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5
1,Expandable PEG rack,"Product received was not as shown/described. This rack is flimsy at best and would NOT be able to hold a coat much less the small handbags I intended for it. Plus, it didn't arrive lacquered. Overall, I feel I received a dollar store item at 10x the cost."
1,Very cheap,"For the price, this wood rack looks and feels very cheap. Wood is very rough, discolored and the knobs are chipped. Because I was going to use it for my husband's caps and will be covered most of the time, I'm going to go ahead and keep it but I would not purchase this item again. In order to make it look half-way presentable, though, I will need to sand and stain this item."
1,peg rack,"Sent wrong item, never had reply to that effect either. never heard from customer representative. tried re-oredering, couldn't get to item then."
3,Good but not the best for personal reasons.,I would give this a higher rating if the wooden pegs were about an inch or two longer. I'm using them to store my bracelets. I can only get 1 bracelet per peg maybe two if they are thin enough. They will do for now but am looking for wooden peg racks with longer pegs.
1,Cheap & Flimsy,We were really surprised at the poor quality of this item. It appeared to be made out of popsicle sticks. The idea that it could safely support 6 -8 mugs is doubtful. Couldn't wait to return it and wished we had read the reviews before ordering.
1,Horrible & Cheap,I would NEVER recommend this product. It was very small & beyond cheap. It looks like something I could get at the 99 cent store.
4,rack,I purchase this rack it is lightweight and very plain so I stained it and added some Rhinestones to it and WOW!!!! I love it! I use it to hand necklaces from it. I would buy it again and do the same thing.
2,Good while it lasted.,Not an heirloom. After a couple of years it could no longer be tuned. I was told that it was not repairable. I supposed it was inexpensive as instruments go and I can purchase another to replace it.
3,really twisted film,"wasn't expecting alot when I saw this film,but talk about Mouth dropping? a Pimp that gets turned out?? also finding the Good Book while all the crazyiness is going down. this is a Underground film.like elements of Mean Streets meet Pulp Fiction. wasn't expecting some of the stuff that went down.it's worth peeping out,but it ain't gonna be the way you think it is all the way through.very twisted film."
3,This is a Comedy ..Right??,"This better be a comedy, cause its too funny. I assure you if you watch this movie you will be splitting your sides every other minute. The reason being is because of the lead character Mike and how pathetic he is. Just watch the movie to see this character's progression downward and the way he handles it all. There are so many hilarious incidents in this movie such as when Mike becomes a christian and then loses his faith and my personal favorite..when Mike is in the bathroom preparing for uhhh ""man love""."
1,Not compatible with Realtek HD audio card,"Unfortunately, the driver is not compatible with my sound card (Realtek HD audio card) in my Sony Vaio RA820G. I can install the webcam and its works but I have horrible interferences on the sound. There is a compatibility problem between the driver and the sound card. I uninstalled the driver and the sound when back to normal."
3,Too early and too few DVDs,"First off, I tried two different versions of this DVD set and both were missing the 4th DVD.... so there appears to be some problem on the manufacturing end.As far as content.... these are the very,very early episodes of the series (actually 2 movies and some episodes), so if you are familiar with those currently run on some USA PBS stations, you may be disappointed. I'd say this set is for those who are true enthusiasts of the series and want to see it from the very start (early 1970's).... and who don't mind taking a chance of only getting 3 out of 4 DVDs."
5,"Gentle, slow, and relaxing humour","If you are looking for Fawlty Towers, AB FAB, Father Ted, or other fast, loud, Britcoms on speed then you should think carefully before purchasing Last of the Summer Wine. I find Last of the Summer Wine, gentle, slow, with a relaxing sense of humour that is wonderful to watch while trying to forget the modern pace of life. The majority of episodes on this dvd set are early episodes, which if you have been brought up on Foggy, (the guy on the far right of the dvd cover, makes for an enjoyable change.The countryside of Yorkshire is wonderful to see and I will be buying the next dvd set when it comes out."
3,Summer Wine,"I enjoy this series and I need some time to get into the English countryside accents. The quality of the 4 disc set, RoyClarke's ""Last of the Summer Wine"" is not of the best reproduction quality and therefore makes the dialog hard to understand and the picture poor."
5,"More info on DVD's and CD's before ordering like on CDs hearing a sample of a song and DVD's, info on when it was made.","The one of the many DVD's I've ordered, Last of Summer Wine, had to guess if that was the one of the episodes made in certain years. So happens it was shows from the early 90's. Other DVD's of same, was done in 70's and 80's and had no way of knowing till I bought it. Two other DVD's I got before this last one, Last of Summer Wine, was older ones and actors were not same as the shows I had wanted to order. But at least the last one is great. Exactly what I wanted. All and all, I've very happy with Amazon's product lines. I mostly order CD's and DVD's. So good job. Just add more info on CD's and DVD's, if possible."
3,Last of the Summer Wine Collection,"I had no problem at all with the DVD's, however, I was disapointed that the characters I was accustomed to seeing in the daily shows were not on the DVD's. Howard, Nora and others were missing. The DVD's were not as entertaining. There was one of the movies, Moving Sam, which was really funny. I have ordered the new set of DVD's being release as Foggy, Norman and the usual folks will be in them."
4,Not What I Ordered,"I was a little disappointed when I receive this 4 disc DVD set. I simply love ""Last of the Summer Wine"" Except the very first series, that is, the ones with Michael Bates. He was so hard to understand and the comedy was a bit to silly. The later series were much better with character like Foggy, Compo, Cleggy. I really like the character Billy Hardcastle and Alvin. They were excellent actor and the humor was absolute hilarious. I like English humor much better than American, the characters are more believable, and the quick wit leaves you chuckling. I am sad that this program has come to an end, it was truly a classic. Bill"
5,Last of the Summer Wine,"Several episodes of the series during the 90's. Very enjoyable, relaxing, and gives great views of the country. Several old friends during retirement deal with their insignificance to the world."
3,a mixed review,"I bought this product because I love this show and because of one reviewer's list of shows supposedly on these DVDs. Unfortunately those were not the shows on these DVDs. Once I realized this I contacted Amazon and received a full refund. About the seller, I can say that this mix-up was not their fault, that the item was sealed and new as stated and delivered promtly.So, for the seller I give 5 stars, for Amazon I give 0 stars because that misleading review should never have been attached to this product but 5 stars for their great CS.What lies in-between are 3 stars. If you buy, understand that there may be reviews that are misleading. What IS on these 4 DVDs are (1) a full-length movie titled 'Getting Sam Home' , (2) a full-length special on the show itself and then (3 & 4) 6 shows (3 on each of the 2 remaining discs). The shows are from the very early seasons."
3,Older Episodes,"This group of four DVDs is from an earlier period (1973, 1975, 1983, and 1989) than we're used to viewing in Dallas. It has two feature films ""Getting Sam Home"" and ""Last of the Summer Wine"" on disc one and two. Disc three has 3 episodes ""Forked Lightning"", ""Who's That Dancing With Nora Batty Then?"", and ""The Changing Face of Rural Blamire"". Disc four also has 3 episodes ""Spring Fever"", ""The New Mobile Trio"", and ""Hail Smiling Morn or Thereabouts"". I hope to see the later episodes on DVD."
1,disappointed,I'm sorry but I didn't realize that you could not watch this in the usa and I was very sorry and disappointed because I was really looking forward to seeing it They should sell it so the usa can watch it and if it is available in that way where can I get it also How do I return it at least then someone who can watch it should be able to enjoy it. It's a shame because it is such a funny show but I've never seen the first shows so I was looking forward to it.Thanks anywayBillie
1,Don't believe the hype,"If a comedy isn't funny-is it still a comedy? The episodes in this set are tedious-and what little humor there is, isn't vey funny at all. The characters are not very amusing or likeable and what little plot there is meanders along at a pace that slows time down to an unbearable level. I am a great fan of Britcoms--but this isn't one I'd recommend. It could be my own sense of humor--but rating Fawlty Towers as a 10--Black Adder and Father Ted as 9's--One Foot in the Grave and Ab Fab as 8's, Keeping Up Appearances and Vicar of Dibley as 7's etc etc--this show is over rated as a ""1"" Along with ""Allo Allo""--this is one of the two worst Britcoms I've ever seen. *it could be this show improved with time--as the episodes in this set are the only ones I've seen--and so they are the episodes I specifically refer to"
2,Dumb by itself,"I bought just the car for my little girl for Christmas. All this toy does is honk, say ""Watch where your going!"", roll the window up and down, and maybe play one song, and whistle. After about an hour she quit playing with it. Maybe it's more fun if you have a house to go with it??"
2,The decline of Pentagram,"Show em How is a bad Pentagram album. Pentagram released 3 amazing albums (Relentless, Day of Reckoning, Be Forewarned). These 3 albums are metal masterpieces and are finally being discovered by legions of hungry metal fans. After these 3 albums, Victor Griffin left the band and Bobby Liebling succumbed to his addictions and personal demons resulting in inferior albums being recorded and produced. By the time Show Em How was released Liebling could barely sing at all and clearly was in no shape to record an album."
3,Smaller than I imagined,This is a simple bit of hardware. It adequately holds one towel (my reason for getting it) but I don't think it's adequate for holding 2 of anything.
4,"great CD, greater band!","I have been a fan of the Nields since college, and have recently seen the sisters together live several times....Their live show (duo or whole group) is spectacular -- I really recommend seeing them, or at least getting ""Live from Northampton"" (available on their website) -- I mention this because there are songs on HOME that I think are better as Live versions (Keys to the Kingdom, This Town is Wrong...).So far, I love every CD they come out with, and am looking forward to the up and coming duo CD too!SEE THE LIVE SHOW! =)"
4,Very Well Done,"I'm glad i got to be the first to review this....the nields are great, and this CD is very good...i just got it so i can't really tell you how good, because all their CD's grow on you. I saw them in concert in Feb. so i heard a few of the new songs...the ones that stand out at first listen are...Wanting and This Town is Wrong Forever, and May Day Cafe....This is a must have for any fans, newcomers should really look into finding their ""Gotta Get over Greta"" or ""Play"" album."
2,Creative Nields go Cheese,"I have been a nields fan for years. I've seen and met the band several times. I must say, this is weak. I almost feel bad talking bad about them and while there are a few beautiful moments, most of the songs are insincere folk cheese. Gotta Get Over Greta was borderline indie-rock. It had edge. It rocked out, broke down with emotion, there was variety! The last two songs on this disc make me very happy, those are affecting songs. The rest are just corn, happy and playful but lacking in depth and charcter. if your looking for an album you can sing along and dance to, it's all you. But if you want an album that with a little more depth , a little more affect, a little more edge, some rock and roll, then you must get Gotta Get OVer Greta. It's one of my all time favorites."
3,Sometimes great songwriters are not great singers.,"This 1976 release was Bunny Sigler's last Philadelphia International release prior to his defection to Salsoul Records (where he scored his biggest hit single ""Let Me Party With You""). While most definitely a great songwriter and producer Bunny Sigler was not a great singer--as such, it's easy to see why he was unable to sustain a solo career."
1,look for better copies,i was given this set by a friend at work and i thank them for that. the movies on the disc are good but the transfers are the worst. poor pictures and sound make this one to pass over.
2,Sobibor,"Sobibor and Samar are decent movies. Pacific Inferno is not worth the money, even if it is included with the other two."
3,Sexploitation Classic Deserves Better,"Mind boggling sexploitation epic featuring drug use, a mad scientist, voodoo rituals, cannibalism, torture by housecats, Phyllis Davis, and her boobs. Scantily clad floozies chop sugar cane while watched over by drooling psycho guards. It has to be seen to be believed. I'm truly surprised that more hasn't been said about this completely awesome film. With Albert Cole, of ""Incredible Two-Headed Transplant."" I usually find the ""Women In Prison"" genre rather boring, never delivering what the lurid poster art promised, but not this one. It's the real deal. Unfortunately, this release from Desert Island Films is a real let down. Clearly mastered from a tape, it's in standard format so you're missing the edges of the film, and popping, crackling horizontal lines occasionally appear at the top of the screen and slowly work their way down to the bottom. Really disappointing. This deserves a nice widescreen transfer from film."
3,very bad transfer,It is a bad transfer. It is out of focus pops & has lines. The only reason I gave it a three is because there are ample scenes of phyllis davis's big firm naked breasts but even her nipples are out of focus. Davis is very hot woman. There is also a lot of other T&A. This is another flick of women being framed going to prison where they are brutilized raped & have sex with both genders then eventually rebel escaping.
3,Nice moments of actor trivia,"This film is exactly what it was intended to be - softcore porn for the drive-in date crowd - and, as such, is enormously successful. If this bit of nostalgia is what you're looking for, you found it.However, there is some fun actor trivia lurking in the exploitation. The actor - Angus Duncan - who plays Dr. John was also the fiance Mary Richards ran away from in the first episode of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" The actor - Timothy Brown - who plays Mojo was also ""Spearchucker"" Jones in the movie ""Mash."" and the first season of the TV show."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I've seen many 70s dramas, but the writing in this one was terrible and almost at the level of a B-movie."
2,Very cheap looking,"I ordered 2 of them and tried to wear them together, but they still looked thin and cheap. Returned them right away"
2,Too BIG,I thought it was nice in the photos but when it can it was too large for my wrist. Nice products looked real
2,Looks very fake,"Like an earlier review said. If you can convince anyone that this is real...... It is costume, and as such is inexpensive, but honestly, don't convince yourself that you can wear this at a function and not expect a couple of chuckles behind your back should you decide to act/convince anyone that it is real. I showed it to a couple Jr. League friends and they laughed."
5,Very classy,"I like it very much, but I think it is a centimeter shorter than advertized because it cuts off circulation to the head [...]."
4,Nice bracelet,"This is a very nice bracelet. I own a lot of CZ and am fairly picky - this has a nice heavy weight, quality clasp, sparkly stones, and would look great with a dress or jeans. Thank you Amazon for a nice, high-quality piece, fast shipping and a good price.Would have given 5 stars except that is is stamped ""RCZ 925 Made in China"" on the clasp and I'm trying to buy items made in the USA these days. I didnt see that it was made in China in the description before ordering."
4,Sparkle,"A really lovely sparkley bracelet - reflects all lights of the prism. Tough, too - puts up with water. Good clasp. Great quality and value for money."
4,Tennis Bracelet,"If you can't afford the real thing this bracelet is the next best thing. Each cz is set individually and it may be around 10 or 12 karats, although it never really stated how many. If you are looking for something really large this bracelet is for you."
5,Great Quality,"Bought this item for my wife, this a fine quality piece of jewelry that is very beautiful. My wife states who needs diamonds when you can get something so nice and no one will know the difference."
5,loves blng!!!,"This bracelet is so much fun to wear. Extremely well made. I don't care that the stones aren't real, I have no problem telling people what it is, and I am proud to tell them where I got from and don't care what to think. I have quite a few tennis bracelets, (cz). you might say I collect them and I love wearing them all at the same time and this is a delight to my colletion."
3,Costume Jewelry,"My boyfriend got this for me with a pair of CZ earrings... he said he almost returned the bracelet when it arrived. Although it's super sparkly and shiny, it looks incredibly fake due to the size of the stones. It does not look cheap or flimsy, just unconvincing. If the stones were just 2 mm smaller it would be far more believable.Also, the Amazon.com Product Description says, ""a line of 32 large round cubic zirconia stones."" The bracelet has 29 stones. This number is accurately written in the product specifications. I'm glad it isn't 32 stones-- it's super lose on me and would honestly fit better with 3 of the stones removed.I wear it going out to clubs when I don't mind if my jewelry gets a bit tarnished. The bracelet is currently on sale for $44.00 with Amazon Prime. It's originally listed at $95.00 and I think it's worth about $30.. maybe $40 since it's all silver."
2,Good auxiliary training; no longer referenced by FAA PTS,"A good, reasonably comprehensive training manual, easy to read. More modern, less technical than American Soaring Handbook (out of print). For many years Joy of S. was the primary basis for FAA Glider Pilot Certificate testing, and I issued hundreds of certificates based on it; now superceded in Practical Test Standards by a different book of slightly inferior quality (Jeppesen)."
1,Good for the beginner,"This is quite a good book for the new glider pilot. It caters primarily for the American pilots. Good graphics. Alternatively, check out the Books by Reichmann and by Piggot"
4,"Dated, but Worthwhile","I suspect that most of us who've bought this book in recent years did so to replace a copy that had gone lost, strayed or stolen. There are other and more recent works that are at least arguably better, but ""Joy of Soaring"" remains a good resource for those learning to fly sailplanes.The reader who gets this book before actually starting lessons should keep one thing in mind. Whether it's sex, cooking or soaring, one thing is true of all ""Joy Of"" books: there's a huge difference between reading about it and doing it. Without actually going aloft with a competent instructor, you really won't learn that much from this book or any book like it. And if your instructor prefers another book, that's the one you want."
3,Monkees Scrapbook,"the book is okay for how fast it was made. me and ""t-bone"" literally put it together in two days and last gasp had it printed before two weeks! we were riding fast and high on the monkees roller coaster as this just after the episodes first broadcast on MTV, which started the second wave of monkeedom in 86. pretty much, eric came down to san diego from SF and spent the night and we crunched through the episodes i had made trivia questions to and he added the text and photos he had whipped out that week. we both used alias, as it seemed more fun to be mysterious. in the book is says who we are anyway. actually the most brilliant thing about the book was when ron (lastgasp publisher), put the word ""scrapbook"" into the form of the famous monkees logo, that way he avoided paying for or using that copyrighted logo! the book isnt all that rare, as ron printed several printings without telling us, but hey hey... what do expect outa a goofy book and publisher?"
3,good suppliment,"this is a great suppliment for dogs, especially for the coat. The product has been slightly reformulated so it is not quite as good as the original as it does not reconstitute as well but still good for the dog."
2,Too many mistakes in the game,"Disappointed by the number of errors in the answers provided with the card set in this game. For what is sold as an educational toy for children, the quality control is sadly lacking. If you accept the information provided in the game, your children will learn misleading answers."
4,Fun and educational too,"I bought this for my 7 yr old, she loves other state games. When we play, I use the older version and she uses the younger questions. Those questions are usually too easy for her though. So of course she wins every game."
5,Sentimental Journey to the Past,"Having grown up in the Bronx, NY during the great depression, seeing my older brothers go off to war, I found this book taking me back to my childhood. Though the author was a generation slightly ahead of mine, the experiences of his family could easily mirror those of my own. The auther has absolutely captured the essence of the times in a charming history of a Jewish family from Poland and its Americanization.The goals and aspirations of the idealist father that were never realized by him, which were brought to successful fruition by the son, is an inspirational story to be appreciated by any reader. Once started it's hard to put down."
5,Deano!,How can you say anything bad about Dean Martin. It made me laugh all over again and brought back many memories of stars that I have not seen or heard from in yeras. Loved it!
4,Teach Yourself Instant German,"I got this book and cassette from the library. I am only on the second lesson. I have been struggling to learn German, since my husband is from Germany, and I feel like an idiot when I'm there and can't understand anyone. This book and cassette appears to be teaching German from a different angle than most of the other cassettes I got from the library, and I'm actually learning!"
4,Pretty Good,This book was overall very good. There was some things that could have been explained more in a few sections. I would recommend it to all people that are using front page.
2,Great Book for Young Children,I read this book to my four year old son. He loves it. He has memorized most of the book. I believe reading this title and other original Dr. Seuss books to your kids is a fun and rewarding activity. Children want to listen to the book over and over. It may make children more interested in reading.
1,"Asinine, Boring Book","This book is SOOOOOOOO annoying! What's the deal with all the rhyming? That got on my last nerve. I can't believe this book is a children's ""classic"". This book does for childrens' books what Jim Jones did for children's drinks (kool-aid, that is). If you want a GREAT children's book, try ""Atlas Shrugged"" the pop-up book by Ayn Rand."
4,What his name?,"So we know who Sam is, but what is the other fellow's name? My 1 1/2 year old wants to know.Other than that, this is a must have and a classic of course. My son loves it."
4,markus the 3-year old kid review of Green Eggs and Ham,"This book has got to be one of my favorite books by Dr.Seuss. I Read this book back in the 1st grade when the books were popular because of the easy reading level. When I read the book it gave me a flashback when I was in the 1st grade. I gave this book a 4star rating because I thought it was a good book, to read because I like all the rythmes. I suggest you read this book if you haven't already."
2,Don't go for the LIFT-and-look version,"I have always loved this story and thought the lift-and-look would be fun as well, but it's not. The flow of the rhymes is the most beautiful part of Dr. Seuss's books, and when you have to stop and lift - the flow is stopped. Also the lift-and-look bits are all over the pages - up, left, down, right - so it is almost impossible to carry on reading fluently while trying to open each. In addition - the font under the flaps is sooooooooo tiny!!!!!This version does not work for me. I am donating this book and will go for the regular."
2,Disappointed,"My one year old LOVES DR. Suess board books and has for the past 6 months. I was excited to find Green Eggs and Ham in a board book, but this one is too wordy, too many flaps and hard to follow for very young children- which is who board books are intended for. We have a collection of others but this one was a bad purchase. I'll wait until he's ready for paper and read the original."
2,Decent condition,"The book wasn't in as good of condition as it stated online. The pages are fine minus a few folded ones but the cover is not ""good""."
3,Rhyming can be fun,I read a great rhyme book called Green Eggs and Ham. This book is written by one of my favorite authors Dr. Seuss. In this book my favorite character was Sam because he will never sit down and be quiet. He always keeps rhyming with Green Eggs and Ham. The Green Eggs and Ham seems nasty but after Sam is done it seems ok. This book is very funny for kids to read because I am sure that your kids will learn how to rhyme after reading this book. This is why I liked this book and I'm sure your kids will to.
3,Wasn't up to par with rating givin.,The book was missing pages and several pages were drawn on. I was hoping for a better book. One that I could read the whole story to my daughter. I was miss led by the description of the book.
4,Green Eggs and Ham,I love this book! I like it because it has rhymes in it and it goes very well with the book. The book is great. Its funny to me and it makes me smile and laugh because of what happens in the book. It just puts a big smile on my face because it makes me laugh all the time and i love it!Alyssa Seifferly
5,School Book Review,"Would you ever eat green eggs and ham? I read Green Eggs and Ham, a book by Dr. Seuss. Sam I Am wants someone to eat green eggs and ham. Who is it and will he ever eat green eggs and ham? Guess what I like about this book? I like that throughout the book Sam is trying to find someone to eat green eggs and ham, this is for me to know and you to figure out. Who is that someone? Would you want someone to bug you for a long time? I think that the author was trying to say, ""You can always try things that you do not look good, but you may like them."" Do you think he will ever eat green eggs and ham? You can find out by going to the library. You can even see who it is that Sam is bugging."
5,My 2-year-old's FAVORITE book!,"My daughter absolutely loves this book! She is a picky eater herself and I truly believe this book is helping her become more open to trying new things. The ending where he tries and likes the green eggs and ham make my daughter SOOOOOO happy. The repetition in the book is great as well. She often ""reads"" the book to herself using the pictures as a guide."
2,Love Dr. Seuss... But Everyone Makes At Least One Mistake,"Dr. Seuss wrote this book to teach children to try new things and not be stubborn about it. However, that's not at all what I got out of it. I read a story about one person (Sam I Am) trying to peer pressure someone into trying a potentionaly dangerous substance (if you ever come across green ham, it's probably horribly expired and covered in mold and bacteria DO NOT EAT IT.) At first he resists but then falls to peer pressure and eats it, realizing it's not as bad as he thought. What a kid might get out of it: parents and teachers say drugs are bad but if your friend likes it then it's good enough for you, and besides, trying new things is good, right? The moral could've been brought across better, but it does depend on the reader."
3,A imperfect classic,"No one can argue against Green Eggs and Ham's importance in children's literature, nor question Dr. Seuss' skill at successfully writing a book with only fifty unique words (and all but one are monosyllabic!).But you would also be right if you see Sam-I-am's dogged persistence as an example of peer pressure, even if the end justifies the means. Are we teaching children that ""No Means No"" only the first dozen times?So if you want a fun rhyming book to deal with a picky eater, tryAlfi Beasti Don't Eat That (Picture Puffin)instead."
5,Green Eggs and Ham,I feel that Green Eggs and Ham is a classic that eveyone should own. I love reading it and will for many years. The rhyme and pictures are great for children of all ages. Besides who doesnt love Dr. Seuss
1,Green Eggs and Ham - Audio Book,"This book is just the audio portion, i.e. the words being read, no pictures so that the child can follow along. It's pretty pointless as a learning tool."
5,One of my favourite books ever,"I loved this book for at least two years, when I borrowed it originally from the University library. Every time I get to the part where (spoiler alert) Sam I Am realises he likes green eggs and ham I tear up. I think it is an incredible piece that speaks to the human condition in a fashion unmatched by Western authors. The connections with existentialism and critiques of nihilism contained within are truly profound."
3,Green Eggs and Ham,Green Eggs and Ham is a fun way for kids to read somethingthat isnt so grown up. Where words dont have to make sense ormean anything. This for a kid who likes reading about thingsthat are out of this world. Cat and the Hat is a very goodstory book writer for kids of all ages. If you like Dr. SuessGreen Eggs and ham is the book for you.
3,I still don't get why this is so popular...,"I didn't like this book when I was a child. The illustrations were kind of strange, and the text was so repetitive and arbitrary. I bought a copy recently (now that I'm an adult) to give it another chance, and I still can't see why it's so popular. I think there are hundreds of better childrens' books."
4,green eggs and ham,"* = do not know nameIn this book, *Bob is not trying new things. Then ""Sam I Am"" is trying to get *Bob to try Green Eggs and Ham, but *Bob does not want to try them. So then they get in this chase where ""Sam I Am"" keeps on trying to get *Bob to try them. Whether it's with a goat or on a train... Then *Bob finally tries it to make ""Sam I Am"" leave him alone. He tries it, and he loves it. Then they are best friends now.I would recommend it to anyone who loves picture books. Also, I would recommend this book to younger kids. This book was very enjoyable when I was a little kid. That was the only book I liked. And I still don't like many books. I would give this book a 4 out of 5 stars."
5,"I do like this book, Sam I am","One of the finest children's books ever written. I enjoyed this story so much, that I passed it on to my kids. I don't remember if I read this as a kid. I do remember having this read to me in 9th grade in Journalism class for our semster final. Kind of a wierd semster final right. Well, it proved to be an interesting day. I remember enjoying this book, and loving everything that the main character said. Dr. Seuss was quite a genuis for coming with imaginative ways to tell a story and make a point."
4,homework,"I liked the book, Green Eggs and Ham. We recently read it in my colege class. I hadn't read it for years. It's a classic and brings back childhood memories for many. I like the way the book uses repetition and rhyming. It's about a character named Sam who's trying to convince the unnamed character to try green eggs and ham. The unnamed character thinks he doesn't like them and is adimant that he won't try them anywhere no matter the circumstance. Sam finally wares him down to the point of trying them just to shut Sam up. When he finally tries them he realizes that he likes them and would eat them anywhere. I recomend this book for children or anyone who would like to remember their childhood."
3,Rose quartz not rosy,"I bought this pendant because of the rose quartz, what I got was regular quartz. So I wasn't impressed with the crystal, but the picture of the fairy is exactly what you get. The chain was a lot nicer than I expected. I wish they would show a picture of the chain. You have to order it at checkout and they don't provide a picture. So I was pleased when it turned out to be a nice small link chain instead of the cable you see pictured with the pendant. So if you order this pendant, don't expect a dark rose quartz, you might not get it. But otherwise the pendant is very nice."
1,Have a trike - need a basket,I have a trike that came with a white basket. I've been looking for a black replacement and $111 is absolutely outrageous no matter how good it is!
1,Worst. Yoga. Video. Ever.,"Jacquie should have probably watched other yoga videos before embarking on this series; she would have learned some valuable lessons. This is quite possibly the most amateur, least produced, least informative yoga video I have ever seen. If you don't believe me, go ahead and purchase it - you can always return it when you're done (and you will)."
2,I'll Give it the Benefit of The Doubt & Give it a 2,"I'm an American living in the UK, so to send this back would cost almost as much as it did to buy it. I have not even done this DVD because the sound quality is so poor that unless my TV is up full blast I can't make out what she is saying. If I have it on loud enough to understand her, the music is so loud it's overpowering. I'm giving it a 2 for concept and because since I haven't actually done the exercizes, I will assume some good can come from them. Not recommended."
1,Bad Buy,"I thought this was the most poorly produced instructional DVD I've ever seen. It was out of sync or something. Each segment opened with the instructor/commentator speaking but you can't hear them so you miss out on what you're supposed to be doing. Also I felt like the video had the feel of soft porn to it. After reviewing the entire DVD my thoughts are that a woman could just continue doing her regular yoga practice, throw in some Kegel exercises and achieve the same results."
2,"Good Idea ruined by lax, careless production","I think the idea of incorporating pelvic muscle strengtheners into a yoga routine is great, but they really blew it with this production. The instructor is unprofessional and giggly, her voice gets muffled whenever she bends over, you can hear cars in the background, there is little instruction for beginners, and the useless voice-overs telling you to contract your core muscles are not synchronized with the breathing or poses. Worst of all, they flash instructional text on the screen when you are in poses that prevent you from reading it! A small budget is no excuse for this sloppy, disorganized presentation - they could AT LEAST have practiced cueing for video, this is the absolute worst cueing I've ever seen in an ""instructional"" video. I gave two stars because the yoga itself(if you completely ignore the instruction, production and delivery) is a decent routine, but don't fall for the marketing ploy, and skip this dvd."
1,for beginners only,"This is patten's master's thesis. He got it published and it won a ""first book award"". that is a major accomplishment. That all took place in 1999. This book reads like a thesis and is for the beginner only. It misses so many points on hegel's concept that I won't list them all. Get Will Dudley's book instead. Or if you're just determined to agree with the other reviews of this book that I followed; then buy a used paperback. Sorry ; I'm proud of patten's accomplishment , but I do not recommend this book."
1,BENNETT DVD SUCCESSFUL BIG GAME FISHING: MARLIN TUNA &,"This DVD deserves a rating well below the one star (which is, unfortunately, the lowest choice).The production quality is substantially below that of most amateur home video.With the exception on a few tips at the end the educational value (my reason for the purchase) is totally non-existent.As it was playing I continually commented to myself ""I paid money for this?"""
1,garbbled weirdness,This is basiclly an album that sounds like a acid tripEven weirder then Zappa. and thats saying something
4,Track Listing is Wrong,Here is the correct listing:1. Our House2. Don't Look Back3. Wings of a Dove4. The Young and The Old5. My Girl6. Stepping Into Line7. Baggy Trousers8. The Business9. Embarassment10. One Second's Thoughtlessness11. Grey Day12. Memories13. It Must Be Love14. Deceives The Eye15. Driving In My Car16. Animal Farm
4,Wish it had a hard-wired power switch,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a fine iron. I'm giving it a 4 star rating because it has one feature that is a little disconcerting. The iron does not have a power switch. When the iron is plugged in it heats up immediately. It does have safety shutoff modes, 30 seconds horizontal and 8 minutes vertical. Why is this an issue? I noticed that during a storm after a brief power interruption that the iron was on. I get a little nervous when heat producing appliances turn themselves on."
4,Track list for Mauve Sideshow self-titled CD,Tracklisting:1 Golden Sand (8:30)2 Beneath The Rose (6:29)3 Barricades (6:23)4 Jet Girl Talks In Her Sleep (3:47)5 Hide In The Rain (4:29)6 Absorbed By The Periphery (8:57)
3,Put Downable,"A little dissapointed in as much as I feelt it fell short of its potential with several important events only alluded to. As with many books it is on bedside table for before sleep reading, however with this book although not a demanding book it took me two weeks to read it and many nights not picked up. However I think as with most people once a certain amount of a book has been read a might as well ""read it to the end syndrome sets in"" and for me this was one such book."
3,An ambitious album whose very diversity may have been its stumbling block.,"This 1986-released album is much more diverse than Eddy Grant's previous efforts. The self-explanatory party anthem ""Dance Party"" was the album's lead single but it barely charted and the album (not surprisingly) sold poorly. The '80s-Rock-influenced numbers ""Next Time Around"", ""Come Along To My Place"", ""Melody Of The Night"" and ""In L.A."" show that Eddy Grant was (is) a true musical genius and visionary who was not afraid to expand his horizons and that he was unwilling to be tied down to any one genre. If you are unfamiliar with this album and are expecting it to be like 1979's ""Walking On Sunshine"", 1982's ""Killer On The Rampage"" or 1984's ""Going For Broke"" you'll be in for a surprise but try to listen to it objectively and you may actually end up liking it."
3,short story writing,The book has most of the techniques used for short story writing. It seems timely and well written and was exactly what I was looking for.
4,Not as romantic or sexy as some of Ms. Henke's books,"This novel lacks the erotic love scenes and some of the sexual tension of Shirl Henke's other novels, but it's still a good read. Also recommend ""Yankee Lord."""
1,different finish,"I ordered driver and passenger mirrors. The passenger mirror had a textured finish while the driver mirror was smooth. The price is right, but these are much cheaper feeling compared to the OEM mirrors and about half the weight."
4,Hey ho! Let's go!,"This is a compilation album featuring cover versions of Ramones songs, or original songs that are about the Ramones. Most of the performers here are from Europe, with over half of them being German punks. Practically none of the groups here are well known, with the most famous being Motorhead, doing their original song ""R.A.M.O.N.E.S."", which was later covered by the Ramones themselves. Most of the performances are very good. Some of the most interesting versions are the ones where they translated the Ramones songs into the singer's native language. My favorite is Die Arzte's ""Die Wikingjugend Hat Mein Madchen Entfuhrt"". That is their version of ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"", although the German title translates into English as something like ""The Viking Youth Has My Baby Girl"". Of course, every album like this has at least one stinker, and in this case it's Patareni's awful version of ""Endless Vacation"". But that's the only bad performance here. Recommended to Ramones fans."
5,Great Boot,"These boots are great and the price is right. The only thing wrong is they run a little small. So everyone, if you order them, order a 1/2 size larger."
2,EquiLEATHER boots,"I ordered these boots from a horse and tack company and was impressed by the picture and title of EquiLEATHER paddock boot. I received them in the wrong color (no biggie), but also saw they were not leather but vinyl! The company seemed so All-American in their advertising, but these plastic boots are made in China! I called the company and they were very nice, but also informed me that Equi means ""fake leather""...and all this time I thought it meant EQUESTRIAN....as in HORSE!! It is afterall, a horse paddock boot!! Not impressed, sent them back, still waiting for my account to be credited."
5,Stripping Doesn't Require a Pole,"The weather stripping is pliable and easy to apply to window edges,cracks etc to prevent cold air from coming in.The stripping is hardly noticeable and blends in well with the adjoining colors.It's permeability allows for easy painting if necessary.It is easily removed leaving no permanent residue.It will more than pay itself the very first month of heating bills."
1,Not Again,The product was cheap and I threw it out. I had to orderfrom another vendor and the quality was much better.
5,"Becky Conrad, a wonderful woman and writter!",I could not put this book down. It was amazing reading of this womans life and Becky Conrad is such a good writter that I was able to get a great feel for each character. Even if the topic doesn't relate to your life I would recomend reading this just for the enjoyment. I look forward to more wonderful books by Becky Conrad!!
5,very warm and comfortable,I have to say this is one of the best purchases I have made relative to the cost.good price and excellent quality
5,Nice and warm,"I bought this and had a friend embroider it for me, its warm and fits comfortably. It embroiders very nice. I run ambulance and it comes in handy while on calls when I have to be out doors. Very pleased with this product"
2,Weak conglomeration of narratives without much Big Picture,"More than anything, this is a collection of first-person interviews with former operatives in OSS during WW2, weakly cobbled together with some uncritical filler narrative. Although there are some brief sections that touch on the broader challenges and decisions of the American intelligence effort, most of it involves repetitive first-person accounts of people hiding in the woods from the Nazis. If that sounds interesting, it isn't. I came away from the book with a modest understanding of what the guys on the ground went through, but with almost no sense of the strategic challenges that sent them there. Having said that, it is an easy read, if only because it is largely devoid of interesting ideas.I would not recommend this to someone who wants to understand the broad sweep of the American intelligence effort in WW2. I would recommend this to someone who has some interest in first-hand accounts of the operatives on the ground."
4,valuable but very dry,"It is a very valuable piece of historic mosaic.E.g. one of many fascinating parts is how blatant were Soviet spies in the State Department when they torpedoed any effort by OSS to obtain intelligence on the Soviet Union.However, the presentation is too dry and too fragmented in my view."
5,An Excellent OSS History,Pat O'Donnell has produced a well-researched and well-written history of OSS operations during World War II. He conducted scores of interviews with OSS veterans. It's a priceless resource for anyone who wants to understand what these brave men and women experienced.
3,Title deceptive- NOT for begginers,"Great workout but the ""not so tough"" is ""not so true"" you can get a great workout here but if you are a beginner or getting back to exercise after not working out for a while don't start here."
5,Actually I think it's Tough,I think this is tougher aerobics than the Firm's Tough Aerobics tape. Actually it doesn't claim this but it tones the upper thighs along with giving you a good aerobic workout and making you sweat:)
3,Requires a lot of coordination!,"I am sold on FIRM videos, but i was disappointed in this one. It requires a lot of coordination, so you might not want to buy it if you're a beginner. Also, the workout requires a step, even though the outside doesn't mention one. So I was pretty much stuck once I figured that out. Overall I love the videos and was disappointed to find one that didn't live up to the others."
5,"Cheesy, but fabulous!","Ha! I love this! Here's the thing: It's only tough if you haven't done any other videos by The FIRM. Otherwise, if you have done a full hour routine, then yes- this one is ""Not So Tough"". =)I like the quick breaks inbetween workout transitions because I can switch weights or drink water. Overall, very good short work out! I def rec trying the full on workouts if you want a challenge!"
5,amazing growth,"Kelli suffered for eleven long years before having the courage to write this collection of poems for victims of domestic violence. Her poems are a testament to her enormous courage. Writing them was not easy. It never is, but writing about abuse is particularly painful. Each one speaks to a step she took that she is now willing to share with others who are facing or have faced abuse. I particularly appreciate the comments following each poem. These enhance her work by interpreting the poem and recommending a step the reader can take to remove herself from a destructive relationship. The poems and comments are reminders also to all those who have not experienced violence directly but who know those who have. They provide a way for all of us to reach out to help victims in many different ways. One of my favorites in the collection is ""She's the One."" This poem reminds us that these women are all around us, if only we would pay attention and know how to recognize and embrace them."
3,camo belt,This belt is okay but I am having a problem because the buckle is really loose and it will come off. So it is good for a little while but I recommend getting a more sturdy buckle.
5,awesome belt,the belt is easy to use and works for any pants obviously. i use it whenever i need it to
1,Dont Do It,Its nothing more than a maxipad for toddlers. I put one in my son's underwear (reluctantly) and saw him walking around with it. I took it out less than 10 minutes later. I was very unconfortable using them. It's not even that it kinda looks like a maxipad - it IS a maxipad. Nothing more. Save your money. I should have saved mine instead. Just let them wear regular underwear and change after each accident. They'll get the hang of it.
1,Don't Do it,"I ordered this camera to be delivered to my vacation spot. It was and I was disappointed all the way. The camera was supposed to come with film and batteries, neither was in the box. The zoom was horrible. I went to reload a new roll of film and could not get the tab for the film to roll over to hook it on. I am returning it for a refund. I must say that Amazon is great with their customer service though."
3,The Honeymoon wore off...,This was a great camera for us for two years. It had great features but began to experience electrical problems after two years of use. It was stored properly and never damaged by a drop or anything traumatic. The estimate to repair is [a lot]! ... What bothers me is two friends with Minolta cameras had similar stories after two or three years!
2,Wish I bought a Canon Rebel Instead,"I bought this camera a year and a half ago. Love the feel - very comfortable. I also love that it can be fully manual or fully automatic and anywhere inbetween. My biggest problem with it is that when I use it as a point and shoot (regardless of mode - portrait, landscape, etc.) all my pictures come out overexposed. They just look washed out. I've tried different speeds, different brands of film, but I have to say that my Fiance's little Canon Sure Shot takes pictures 10x better! I haven't given up yet, but I do wish I had spent the extra money and bought the Canon Rebel instead."
4,Minolta Maxxum,"Saw this camera with a friend and fell in love with its features. Great design and greater ease of use. A novice at SLR usage coming from a basic point and click genre, I found that I could become really good at taking some fantastic shots."
4,Minolta Maxxum QTsi 35mm,"This is a great camera. It takes fantasic pictures and is very easy to use. I especially like the easy loading film and the autofocusing that allows for sharp, detailed pictures every time. The ""action"" or ""sports"" setting works very well for all types of action photos. The only draw back is that I've tried to attach it to my telescope to photograph the moon and it can NOT be used for this type of photography."
2,Return,I baught this camera because it was a little cheaper than the canon but soon found out I should have spent the extra money. It is an ok camera but the versatility is limited and I question the durability over the long haul. For a beginer's camera it works but don't expect to much more.
3,"Missing the ""kit"" part of the camera!?!?!","I was excited to get my ""new to me"" camera. I knew it was a stock photo that had been used for the picture so I didn't worry about it. But my son has the same camera and his came with ""The Kit"" = camera strap, lens cover (so the lens will not get scratched)and a battery in it. So needless to say I was a little disappointed."
2,Minolta Maxxum QTsi SLR Camera,"To look at the camera it looked very nice. I first discovered the batteries were dead when it said they were good. Then after taking a whole roll of film and nothing developed, I discovered the shutter curtain was indented - pushed inward. Since a manual didn't come with the camera, I was able to download one and saw a picture that the shutter curtain was to look smooth. This is the first time buying something used, so I guess in the future I need to be a little more cautious."
4,Takes Great Pictures,My wife and I chose this camera as our first non-phd camera (push here dummy). It is very easy to use and takes great pictures. So far we have not had any problems finding accessories for this camera when we have wanted to purchase them. It's functions are easy to learn and my wife had everything she needs to start a photography class next semester. I would recommend this camera to anyone purchasing one.
4,Good 35 mm lens camera,"Good quality, and easy to use.Minolta was used to be one of great camera company. But, unfortunately, Minolta camera section was over.So, it IS good."
2,$275 piece of junk,"Do not buy this camera, I bought it because it looked like a professional camera and because I thought Minolta was a good brand. I was wrong on both, learn from my mistake. The picture quality is poor to average at best. I thought maybe it was the developers fault so I tried another developer, same results. I can't tell the difference between the pictures taken with this camera and the cheapo I used before I got this one. You could spend a lot less to get the same picture quality. Minolta has poor customer service when you have a problem. Buy a Nikon or a Canon, I'm going to."
3,Not quite as expected,"Arrived late due to it was wrongly addressed, it had been opend twice(three different tapes used).The camera was ok but did not work quite as I had expected, its just to automatic in operation. Much better suited to a novice."
2,Perhaps for a pro but not for an amature,"I got this camera for my dad thinking that he needed a hobby but he also needed a camera. This camera claimed to be easy enough for an amature, but powerfull enough for a pro. He has had very little success with making it do anything beyond the duties of a traditional camera, and in that function it is simply over complicated. For all I know it is a fine Professional camera, but as far as being a good personal camera it falls short."
1,This is a junk camera...,"I bought this camera in oct-99 in Orlando (FL) ... before eight months I have a problem with the instruction panel, it doesn't work... In may-00 I sent it to an Minolta authorized center in Miami, then they said ""It's working again"" but it didn't true... In Jan-01 I send it (again) to an authorized center in Indiana, they fixed it (again), and again it didn't work... at this moment I spend about $80 trying to fix the camera but the camera is junk..."
2,It's only trouble!,"I bought this camera 2 weeks ago in Paris Charles De Goule Airport duty free. Until now it fixed two times on it's flash.My minolta service said ""It has production mistake by flash""."
3,Big Comfy Couch DVD,My daughter likes the DVD very much. The only thing wrong with the DVD is that it doesnt have continous play. It doesnt go right into the next episode. You have to select the next episode from the menu and play it.
4,Interesting read,A great historical read from a legendary military man. Any person who studies the three major conflicts he was in must read this book
1,Not a durable boot,"The boot is comfortable, warm, waterproof, and protected my feet from falling objects. However, the side snaps broke off after 3 weeks. A week later, one side zipper broke. The zipper should be on the outside of the ankle so they do not collide with each other. I liked this boot and am disappointed in the poor construction."
3,A classic text: readers seeking to justify their beliefs will be pleased,"Most biblical scholars today appreciate that researchers bring their own beliefs and prejudices into the evidence - but then they go ahead and make a ""case"" or ""proof"" regardless. Whenever evidence is evaluated and judged in order to present a theory or case, violence will be done to objective truth. This doesn't mean that Habermas is incorrect, only that the material provided was selected to lead readers to his conclusions. If you already believe in the historical Jesus, this book may support that belief. If, however, you do not, the research and arguments will do little to convince you.Jesus Potter Harry Christ: The Surprising Parallels that Expose the Truth about the Historical Jesus, the Christ Myth, and the Secret Origins of Christianity"
1,The missed Memo,I am assuming the author has missed the various memos on the refutation of a historical Jesus. There is NO evidence for Jesus. Anything beyond this proposition is intellectual dishonesty.
3,Tiny book,This is a great giveaway type product. It has a great message and is a quick read to help remind you to keep your priorities straight.
4,great textbook,"Be forewarned, this is a textbook, not some easy-reading self-help book. The book explains that we erect defenses in relationships because of our mother, self-hate, and fear of death. It also explains how those defenses manifest themselves and how they are damaging to meaningful living. The book also relates how duality (saying one thing when we mean another) is damaging, in both adult relationships and with our children. There is a lot of explanation and insight here, but not a lot of direction for solving the problem."
4,Intense Unrequited Love set against the Civil Conflict in the Baltics circa 1918-19,"Erick von Lhomond twenty years later reflects on the events during the time of the Russian Civil War when he was a young man. This relatively short novel focuses on Erick's relationship with a brother and sister, Conrad and Sophie. Set in the Baltics, at Conrad and Sophie's aristocratic home which has been converted into an army barracks, Yourcenar beautifully draws out Sophie's unrequited love for Erick against Erick's indifference and strong comradeship for Conrad. There is an undertone of Erick's lack of interest in women having a gay aspect although Yourcenar never brings this to the surface. This harrowingly tragic novel is vividly and authentically written and based on a true event."
3,Its not all that bad,DeNiro was only in the movie for a few moments but George Segal is the star and he gives a harrowing and brilliant performance as a hundred dollar a day heroin addict. The film is funny and sad unfortunately utterly truthful. This film forshadowed a whole generation of films about lost souls adrift in our blasted urban landscapes. Its a bit on the morbid side at first but will please you towards the beginning of the second half.
5,Powerful filmmaking,"There have been a number of ""dope"" films that have followed ""Born To Win"". None have been as searing, honest, funny, and profound as this one. The acting is superb, the writing brilliant, the direction first-rate. This is cinema at its best, powerful filmmaking. George Segals performance is as good as it gets. See it!"
3,A Sadly Neglected Film,This little film from the early seventies stars major film star Robert De niro in a role I'm sure even he can't remember doing along with george segal who plays JJ a sucsessful hairdresser who's hooked on heroerin and runs afoul of the mob. So JJ is up to his neck in trouble when the cops use him to get the goods on a drug smuggler. Absorbing at times very well acted By segal in this somewhat twisted comedy/drama Best scene is when JJ & His friend are shooting up in a washroom in an abandon office floor JJ'S friend overdoses on what he thinks is heroin but instead it's battery acid laced inside the drug meant for JJ. A powerful scene displaying Segal at his efftictive moment in the film. A bittersweet film more regareded and appriciated today then it was first relased over twenty years ago.
2,DeNiro fans should look somewhere else.,"I bought this movie for one reason, and that reason is that Robert Deniro was in the movie. I fell asleep after about 45 min. into the movie, which was after Robert Deniro's cameo. If your a big Robert DeNiro fan such as I then you should look into Taxi Driver, Casino, Goodfellas, Midnight Run, Guilty By Suspicion, Ronin, Analyze This, The Fan , and Ragging Bull. Deniro only has a small part in this film, and as much as I love to see Deniro's brillant acting ability this is not the movie to catch him at his best. Deniro fans should look somewhere else."
4,"early indie film, with many surprises in the stars to come later","I was very surprised at the quality of this film. The acting is solid and good, the story quite believable and unpredictable (i.e. not hollywood endingswith love winning, baddies falling, and whatever redemption needed is forthcoming), and there are many future stars in it as young actors.JJ, just out of prison and a junkie with no life but some friends, meets Karen Black, who accepts him as he is with a wonderful chemistry of laughter and attraction. He has lost his family and there is plenty of regret through all the chemical highs. JJ is always trying to score, and is basically a loser, about to lose again. Black changes this to a degree, but the momentum of JJ's life is too strong for her and eventually brings her down. Segal is entirely convincing, really better than I have ever seen him.Recommended for the story and for film buffs."
1,Born to Win,"I received and was billed for two (2) of these for some reason. I only ordered one, of course. In addition, the movie was horrible."
4,"Easy, enjoyable read",I truly enjoyed reading this book. Mr. Stevens does a fantastic job of focusing on what is entertaining and interesting. He does not dwell on useless facts that typically bog a book down; instead he tells witty little stories of his experience. I received this book on a Friday and finished it by Sunday it was a quick highly enjoyable read.
4,"A terrifically funny tale based on ""the African Experience.""","Since I served in the Peace Corps in the CAR and had also visited neighboring countries, I found myself chuckling and nodding animatedly throughout my reading of Malaria Dreams. Stuart Stevens is a gifted writer; he is able to put words together in a way that creates vivid images which are hilarious in their truth. Stuart expressed well the mixed emotions one feels when visiting the dark continent: it is remarkably frustrating for First World folk to function in the African system, but at the same time there is something so wonderful about the African experience and the African people. I had a great time reading Malaria Dreams and riding along on the journey. Once you've returned home from a stay on the dark continent, Africa continues to lure you back by tugging on your heartstrings."
3,Entertaining but that's about all,"This book is very entertaining and amusing. It is solely about traveling through countries in Africa as most travelers, that is without learning much about local customs, how the people live, what their hopes and dreams are. It is all about the author and his friend and what other white people they could hook up with when they arrived in a new town or village. It is very much written as an outsider but then it was never meant to be more than that."
1,That wasn't a charm,"I sent this back. What arrived looked like the picture, but turn it and there is no hole to thread the chain through. What was that?"
5,"True Italian folk music, The stuff I grew up listening to.","This is the true Italian music we listened to as children when the ""Family got together"" for such occasions as Biroldi feeds in the winter when the slaughter was done, also on occasions as weddings and for funerals."
1,untrue description,The mattress was described as having a 1/2 inch thick foam pad on top.This seemed like a desireable feature. It does not have a foam pad.There is seperate air chamber on top with flocking applied to it.The mattress is a rip off. Similar ones are about 1/2 the price. I have purchased a mattress pad. The pad helps.
2,That is not memory foam,"We bought this product for the memory foam (paying 2x as much as other elevated air mattresses) and it was not worth it. After buying an egg crate to put on top of it, the mattress is in deed comfortable. I would recommend buying a cheaper mattress and putting an egg crate on top of it. You pay much more for this supposed memory foam and get nothing for the price difference. That being said, the mattress does meet all other claims - it sits nice and high, inflates and deflates well, and comes with an easy to use carrying case."
3,Revised & Updated? Please!,"The book is outdated. It has several references to things that are clearly not done any longer. Like creating a slide show for a business. Not a computer powerpoint slideshow but the original slideshow that families used to show after a vacation. C'mon update the book. Having just criticzed the book for failing to update the text, I do think there is a lot of positives in the book that make it worth purchasing. It is not a ""let's show you how"" kinda book - it is more of an idea book. Very good, entreprenuerial ideas that I'm sure many overlook. One positive of it being outdated is that instead of the title being ""Make $25,000 a year"" it really should now be ""Make $50,000 a year"" simply due to the old pricing he refers to."
5,Excellent accessory,"This is a excellent accessory for to gain more fun with video game.A good example, you use a Game Boy Advance and play Pokemon Crystal.With the JoyTech DUAL LINK CABLE for use with Game Boy, you can trade Pokemon with your friend who use a Game Boy Advance or Game Boy Color.It is cool."
2,Olewo,This product took over 10 days to recieve. Very slow and we were not amuzed. We will most likely purchase this product from ebay or another portal.
3,Interesting but uneven,"""Devil"" is kind of a strange film. It's watchable and even a bit compelling in spots, and the scenery variates between lush and amazingly eyecatching to obvious-looking sound stage. The script is cliche-ridden, yet not gagging, and the predictability of the plot is rampant. The acting isn't bad for what it is, but truly, only Tracy seems to be giving anywhere close to 100%. Maybe Bernie Hamilton. Sinatra is so-so, and others overact. And while the tale as a whole is interesting, it just doesn't ring true in the end. A film that seems longer than it is, too."
4,wow! What a ride!,"This movie may have been made back in the 60's, but it is an ideal subject for remake. Spencer Tracy and Frank Sinatra are fantastic in this movie about a volcano that is about to imitate Krakatoa."
2,"Basic cooking, trendy food",If you have more than a basic knowledge (how to baste a chicken or stir rice)of cooking or if you aren't into trendy food this cook book is not for you. It would however be a good choice for someone who is just starting out on their own and just learning how to cook.
4,Born Romatic,"This movie cute; has some funny scenes. Craig Ferguson is great; especailly when he sings ""L is for the way you look at me..."" Not a bad flick."
5,Romantic and quirky,"This film passes muster for me because it is romantic, quirky and the characters are linked in interesting ways. The main threads in this film that bring the characters together are a salsa club and a cab driver with an interesting past. Very BBC. A warning for some: as in many British films, there are a few spots of F-word spouting, which is why it is rated R."
3,BOSS The Bill Stroppe Story,"Anyone looking for a general history of US racing from the late 40's to about the 80's would do well to have this book. Stroppe was mostly a Ford guy, but he did everything from Mexican road races to Indy to stock cars to desert and stadium dirt races. Along the way he raced with or against almost every name you can think of. A great no-BS history of how we got where we are today."
4,Konica Minolta 70-210mm,Very nice lens in bright conditions. Hunts a little in dark. Have to stop down to f11 for no CA. at f4.5 with filter you'll get alot of CA.
4,Cooliest Gadget Ever!,"Overall, this is a great product. I had never used a cookie press before and this was incredibly easy. The only notable thing that is a bit tricky is that the cut-out shape has to be place on in a certain direction and there is no marking to direct you. You essentially have to place it on, try to squeeze out a cookie and it either comes our or not. You then have to swtich the plate over and it works. Once you get the hang of it though, super easy!My only other comment would be not to use pre-packaged dough. They will come out in the shapes but when they bak they loose their shape. I think it might be that the dough is not dry enough. They are definitley cute but my candy canes looked more like mittens when they were done. :)I would definiely reccomend this to even a novice baker. It was a lot of fun!"
4,fourleftys,"I purchased this item for the decorating tips. I like the idea of the clear tube to see where my icing is at. Of course I tried the cookie press and found that I love using it. Especially with the holidays upon us it sure makes baking those dainty little cookies easier. I would recommend this product for anyone who loves not only baking, but making pretty little cookies as well. I encourage people to try this product. It has served my well in the short time that I have owned it."
1,didnt work for me,"this cookie press would not release the cookies. trigger was very hard and the cookie came out, but would not release onto the cookie sheet. one shot after the other only created a blob and one press created bits of the cookie. Regardless, they all stuck and never released :("
2,Plastic tube cracked after a couple of uses!,We may have had a bad one but the plastic tube cracked after a couple of uses.
2,Kuhn Rikon Cookie Press,I've made cookies for years using the Mirro twist press. I use the star for the wreath spritz cookie by squeezing it out then pinching it together. Every year I look for a cookie press to make a quick wreath as the twist method takes so long. I tried this press this year and did not like it. The tube is very small - too small compared to the mirro. The size of the cookie (wreath) was an inch - that is just too small for a cookie - even a dainty one. I didn't try the other types as I was only interested in making the wreath.
1,Made in China!!!,Bought this press Dec. 1st. with the hope of having some nice holiday cookies this christmas. What a joke. Plunger is smaller then Tube Dough and iceing buy pass plunger and fill trigger houseing making it inoperable
2,As a Baker,"I am co owner and co baker of Patsy's Cookies - we love the press and the disk, but we press thousands of cookies and the press is really meant for casual bakers. Before I started baking professionally, my press lasted for years, now I go through them in weeks."
4,No extra barrel!,"I recently ordered the cookie press for myself and it came with the extra barrell as mentioned in one of the reviews. So I decided to order another cookie press for a friend. When I received it, there was no extra barrell."
3,cookie press,"Again this item was purchased for my wife, as the old cookiemaker was broken. This item is a bit difficult to work withbut once you learn how to use it it works ok."
1,Don't bother,"I am an avid baker and thought I was trading ""UP"" with this purchase. Used it once last year--with inconsistent results. Tried again this year and the plastic cylinder cracked leaving me with a mess and a cookie dough that ended up in the trash. There has to be a better product on the market. I think the stainless steel cylinders are the way to go."
2,Keeps breaking :(,"I have had this press for about 3 years now and I really like it...when it isn't broken. The plastic ring that holds the decorating plates in place has broken on mine twice. :( It just doesn't seem to be strong enough to handle the pressure necessary to hold back the dough when in use. The company did replace the part for free for me the first time...I'm hoping they will again, but how many times is it going to break? And will they continue to replace it?UPDATE: I HATE this cookie press. After 3 replacements on the ring, it continues to break. This is worthless and only ends up making me angry when I try to use it. If I could change it to ZERO stars, I would in a heartbeat."
1,Waste of money,"The extruder shaft pushed right through the plastic extruder disk rendering the entire thing useless the second time that I used it with cookie dough. I'm on the lookout for a more durable model, so can't recommend anything yet - but save your money on this item."
2,Disappointed,"I've had a Kuhn Rikon cookie press for 2 years and every year it has been a struggle to make Christmas cookies. Yes, it's easy to clean but my main concern is having the cookies come out easily without sticking. I am currently shopping for another cookie press and won NOT recommend this brand."
2,Kuhn Rikon Cookie press,"Overall, I think it is a good product, but the size makes it difficult to use. The tube, into which the dough is inserted, is so small you must constantly reload it. I would not recommend this product."
5,I'm IMPRESSED with this press!,"I used other popular cookie presses for holiday baking and found them to be a hassle to operate and to clean, the last one I had didn't provide enough leverage to extrude the dough. Someone recommended this one from Kuhn Rikon and then I ordered it out of a catalog for 1999 Xmas cookie baking. This one is really slick. The trigger grip mechanism allows one-handed operation so you have the other hand free to cut dough or finish forming cookies. I like the see-through body so I know exactly how much material I have left. All the parts are nicely finished and it's really easy to clean. There are lots of choices of dies and tips and I found the star die exactly the right shape for Scandinavian Vannilie Kranser. This is so much better than others on the market!"
2,The Trigger Mechanism breaks?,"I used mine a few times with pretty good results, but the last time I tried, the trigger mechanism that presses the dough out wouldn't work. It seems to be totally shot and is only a year old. That wasn't worth it, my mom had a metal one for years and years."
5,"Finally, one that works!","I have had a half a dozen Spritz cookie presses over the years - ranging from the most basic metal ones to electric and everything in between. NONE of them ever gave me the results that this press did today. IF you follow the recipes and directions that come with the Kuhn Rikon cookie press, you WILL be able to make beautiful Spritz cookies. Finally. Yes."
4,Excellent for cookies,I dont think you will be disapointed with this overall. I wasn't smitten with the butterfly shape however. I highly recommend this cookie press.I bought this cookie press to make snack items for my son's wedding. It is terrific! I followed the instructions and made perfect cookies! I really like the flower and heart shapes and they came out nice as well.
1,Plastic Casing Broke After 3 Cookies,"Kuhn Rikon LaPatisserie Cookie Press and Decorating SetAfter pressing out 3 cookies, the plastic tube popped apart at the seam and now this press is useless. I see that this has happened to a few other reviewers...not worth the risk to buy this, it might happen to you. I also see that the trigger mechanism can fail after a short period, but of course mine will never be tested!"
2,No spritz cookies this year,I bought this cookie press with high hopes after reading other reviews. I was very disappionted in its performance. I was unable to press out any cookies. The only thing going for this machine is the ease in cleaning it.
2,"Lowbudget, but Entertaining.","I'v herd allot of good reviews from this SP Western.I got it along with the Spaghetti Western box set. The movie was entertaining and you can expect cheesiness, but the Bayou Billy looking Hatchet character was cool and the DVD was restored very well. If it wasn't for the corny theme song they chose for this movie I would actually give it 3 stars, but every time that annoying murky theme song that didn't fit in played, It ruined my attention to the film. Overall I recommend this(although overpriced) movie,just push mute when the corny theme song plays and enjoy."
1,shoes that would never fit,"We received the shoes which were ordered in a size 13. They were tried on by both my daughter who is a size 12 and myself who is a size 11. There was not a prayer of getting these shoes on. There was no indication on the package or in the package how to contact the seller or return the shoes. I went online and found the email for the seller and asked for instructions on how to send the shoes back. It took 2 emails to get a response and there response was to try to get the shoes to fit, that this type of shoe you have to ""squeeze"" into and it will stretch to fit. This was unacceptable. It took 2 of these emails to get them to give my an address to send the to and a return # which is needed in order to get credit for the return. I was highly disappointed with this whole process and I still had to pay for the original shipping of $10.00 and another $9.00 to get them back to them."
2,This DVD version is EDITED...too bad.,"I too like this movie a lot. Unfortunately, this DVD edition has been sourced from an edited Tv print of the movie. Magnum Video's long OOP VHS version (under the title TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR SADISM) is about 12 minutes longer than the DVD.Hopefully someone will put out an anamorphic widescreen uncut version someday. Until then, track down the Magnum tape and avoid this DVD. The picture quality on the DVD isn't great anyway."
1,Poor DVD release!,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the Jef DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally."
3,Atmospheric chiller with equal amounts of blood and laughs.,"If low-budget spookiness, with a campy edge and a bit of blood is your bag, 'Castle of the Walking Dead' comes highly recommended."
4,Popcorn seasoning,"We like the popcorn with the Wabash Valley Farm popcorn seasoning since we have learned to put just the right amount on it. When we first used it, we were very disappointed because it was too salty. We tried it again, used less and now really enjoy our popcorn with it."
3,Good Golly this stuff is salty!,"I just received a popcorn machine as a gift and I'm still trying to figure out the right combination of oil, popcorn and seasoning to get good tasting popcorn. The flavor of this seasoning is good, but man, it packs a wallop of saltiness! I am a salt-a-holic. I salt just about everything I eat and this stuff is almost too much for me. I still eat it...cuz it's good. I just drink lots of water!"
2,disappointing,"no matter how little of this product I use, it is still WAY too salty. I'd like to find something with more ""butter"" flavor and less ""salt"" flavor."
3,MUCH smaller than I thought,Maybe I read the description wrong but these are itty bitty leaves. As cutters they're fantastic just not what I expected size wise.Update: I have used these 3 times to cut slices of cheese for my son's lunch and now they are rusting! Very disappointed they will now be used by my son in his play dough since I don't trust them for food anymore :(
2,Out dated film technology,Lacks modern sophisticated technology; poor acting and poor quality film production. Not recommended for Biblical education or teaching of scripture.
1,This is absolutely illegal,after watching this dvd i understood how people changed the words of god. i am a person who beleives that there should be only one religion and that is why i love prophet abraham so much.unfortunately people always change something according to themselves just like this movie's subtitle.they changed original movie they cut of some scenes and they changed subtitles.long time ago some people did the same thing and they changed all religions.i am so disappointed after watching this dvd(not movie) and i will try to get my money back because this dvd is copy not original.
3,Love the movie but book is very long,"Our family loves this movie. I bought with the intention to add to our Christmas book collection. It has beautiful illustrations. Our children are still young ages 4,4 and 2 1/2. This book is too long to read to them now- but would be fine for an older elementary school age kid."
5,magical,A boy takes a magical train ride on Christmas Eve to the North Pole to receive Santa's special gift. This magical journey really gave my 6 year old twins the Christmas spirit.And it helped me recapture the magic of Christmas from my childhood. I feel that you and your chidren will love this warm and kindly volume.
5,Happy Holidays!,"Don't let the reading level (which is listed as ages 4-8) deter you, this imaginative story is loved by children of all ages including those adults who are still young at heart. Chris Van Allsburg spins an enchanting holiday tale of mystery, magic and love that leaves readers and listeners believing that they are on an adventure to the North Pole. The pictures are rich, colorful and detailed. It is one of those rare stories that leave children wide eyed and wondering if there really is a Santa Claus. This book has become a tradition in our home. We will be among the first in line to see The Polar Express movie. Happy Holidays!by JoAnna Carey, Author of Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life"
5,Christmas Classic,"First of all, the illustrations in this book are simply fantastic. I remember, as a child, being enamored with the wonderful pages filled with pitctures of the train, the children, the christmas scenery, and, in particular, the illustration of the wolves. Secondly, this is a fantastic christmas story suited for not only children, but adults. A true Christmas Classic, this story has never become tiresome, and I loved it as a kid and fondly remember reading this with my family when I was young. This is a great story that can be shared with your entire family."
5,"""The Polar Express"" awesome book review","""The Polar Express"" is a timeless story meant for all ages. It forces us to think about the disadvantage of growing up. When it's Christmas Eve a young boy suddenly hears a train whistle outside his window. He is welcomed aboard the Polar Express by the train conductor and many other children ready to depart on a trip to the North Pole. It is there that they will meet Santa and find out who the special child is that will receive the precious first gift of Christmas.This fantasy story is one of the best-written about the true meaning of Christmas. The realistic details and dialogue more the story along. The style and meaning behind the plot is enough to make you remember it for years to come.When reading ""The Polar Express"" all you think about is meeting Santa and discovering the gift of Christmas. Anyone who likes a well-told story with a moral to remember will love this book!"
5,Great for kids - even BIG ones!`,I purchased this audio book for my grandchildren - they checked it out a the library and kept renewing it as they loved it so much. I decided they needed one of their own and they so enjoy it. We have an anual Polar Express Party and watch the movie together every Dec. and it is a very special time for all of us.
4,The Polar Express,The theme plus the art work of this book are well worth having. To know that it developed into a really frist class animated video with a lesson which is ageless is truly worth thinking about.
5,The Polar Express,The Polar Express is a wonderful christmas children's book! The little boy in the book is swept away Christmas Eve night to the north pole where santa is by a magical train and he witnesses all of the Christmas wonder. He sees toys being built by santa's elfs and all the goodies being baked by Mrs. Claus. Santa gives the little boy a bell from one of the reindeer's collars so that all of his friends at home would believe him when he told them about his wonderful evening but he loses it on his way home. Christmas morning he opens a small gift that his parents don't know where it came from and he finds the bell that he lost and a note from Santa. This book will make a believer out of your child!
4,The Polar Express,"This book is written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg. In 1986, he received a Caldecott Medal for the ""Polar Express"". He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on June 18, 1949. He now lives in Providence, Rhode Island, with his wife Lisa, and two daughters Sophia and Anna.""The Polar Express"" is about a little boy whose faith in Santa Clause is slowly disappearing. One Christmas Eve night, a magical train takes him and other children to the North Pole. When they arrive, they meet Santa Clause and the magic begins.In my opinion, I think this is a wonderful child's book. It's fun to read, and keeps the children guessing what will happen next. The illustrations are magnificent; they really bring the story to life. I think it also teaches children to never loose faith in what they believe in, no matter what society might tell them."
4,Polar Express,I relly like this book because how the auther wrote this book and how the dawer drew the pitchers. When I look at the pitcher it makes me feel like I am there on the Polar Express and in the north pole with all of the other people and elevs Thats is way I like this book!POLAE EXPRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Love the Art Work,"I have never cared for the story all the much. Can't stand the movie!! Ugh, All the characters were completely soulless and Santa and the elves were sooooo spooky and creepy. I go out of my way not to let me son see it again. But the art work in the book as well as the train itself in the movie. Love it! so the book is a great picture book at best."
5,A Family Favorite,"As a gift for my son and his family, each of my granddaughters received a copy of the Polar Express and tickets to a Polar Express train for the 2013 voyage. The whole family is looking forward to this trip and reading the book, watching the video and listening to the soundtrack adds to the anticipation."
5,new book,I am very satisfied with the purchase of the new The Polar Express book and cd. Thank you very much.
4,VERY NICE GIFT SET,My son asked Santa for it and he was really happy when he got it. He loves it. I only gave it 4 stars because the bell was real cheap. It's a wonderful story for the whole family to enjoy.
3,Didn't read description close enough,"I was disappointed to find out that the CD & cassette were a ""book on tape."" I thought they were the soundtrack. I definitely didn't read the description close enough.The book, though, is always a favorite gift to give!"
5,I like this book...and I think you will too!,This book is about a little boy who finds a train in front of his house. He has a chance to go on a great journey...does he get on the train? I think you will like this book. This book makes me feel happy. Your kids might like it too!
5,"If You Like Christmas Read This Book ,You'll Like It!",Would you ever like to go on a train to the North Pole? Well this boy did. On The Polar Express he goes to the North Pole. This book is so good because the pictures look real. It also teaches you to believe in Santa Clause. They get to find out who gets the first gift of Christmas. Will the boy get the first gift of Christmas? Read The Polar Express by: Chris Alsberg find out.
1,Badly written; not-very-magical illustrations,"Glad I didn't buy this one! Starts of with promise but the North Pole is not a magical, sparkly place but a grim place full of factories & workers. Santa Claus is not presented in a friendly way at all - he even ""whips"" his reindeers! Scary I thought. And the final message is you ""must"" believe (in Santa Claus... or anything else I suppose) or you won't partake in something special...Didn't like it at all - and my 4-year-old girl was unsure... certainly not worth the hype. Thousands of better, way more magical/comforting/spiritual books out there."
1,"Really, what is all the hype about?","I read this book in the bookstore. It took me a minute. There is absolutely no depth to the book at all. It never has a chance to have depth because it basically goes like this: Event A happens, Event B happens, Event C happens, Event D happens, etc, like two weeks worth of the comic strip ""Mary Worth"". Each page has one paragraph in it and pushes the story along one inch at a time. And then it ends. A lot of things that were in the movie weren't in the book and that's somewhat to the book's redemption. Perhaps the book has sparked memories in some readers' pasts and that has what has endeared it to so many but for me reading it was an empty experience."
1,Well...,"A pleasure to read but has nothing to do with the meaning of Christmas. It makes me sad when people talk about christmas meaning giving and showing kindness but leave out the birth of Jesus. If I would say no one knows the true meaning I'm sure I would be told that many people do. So why in almost every movie, tv show, book, especially made for children, never mention Jesus's birth? Instead of teaching about Santa, why not also teach children what Christmas is about. The book was sweet, but missed the meaning. Or really, I didn't see it."
1,Fascist Images Are Not Appropriate For Children,"We took this book out of the public library for our three year old child expecting a nice, warm story about Christmas. This is not what we got.Apparently, Santa has become a 1930s style fascist leader who speaks in front of large crowds and raises his hand in a gesture that looks disturbingly like a Hitler salute.I never knew St. Nicholas made it to Nuremberg."
1,Perfect childrens tale for the Material Age,"Bland unimaginative story about a tyke who doesn't believe that someone up north doesn't pump out toys for all the little girls and boys. Santa and his village as portrayed in this book, would have fit in perfectly in Nazi germany.A perfect book for the entitled and spoiled American child of the Uberclass of consumerist American drones."
1,so wanted it to be great!,"such a famous story. so disappointing. no plot, not a story--just a whimsey thought.lovely drawings. nice last line.wasted moneywasted expectation."
1,Polar Express 3D and a 2D,"I WAS SO UPSET WHEN WE PUT THE 3-D ON FOR OUR 6 YR. OLD GRANDSON TO WATCH! WE HAVE AN HD T.V WITH 3D AND EXPECTED IT TO BE WONDERFUL. WHEN YOU PUT ON THE RED/BLUE GLASSES ON WE SAW A PALE WHITE WITH A PALE RED/BLUE TINT, LUCKILY WE HAD GOTTEN THE SET WITH 2D, SO AFTER 5 MINUTES WE LET HIM WATCH THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE ANY COMPANY COULD SELL THIS, IT IS A JOKE!!"
5,Such a Special Book!,This is one of our family's favorite books! It arrived quickly and in perfect shape and the price was right! $10.99! There even was a DVD of the movie! It is the special 25th year edition!
5,A Classic Story of all time!,"This story is so filled with what the true meaning of Christmas is all about: of love and giving. It's a story for the young and the old as well.This book is forever a classic in our home,to read over and over through the long winter nights."
3,good deal for the price,"This is such a wonderful book. We have watched the movie probably 20 times, but just recently thought about getting the book. We are still reading the book each night, even though it is February! Was a little disappointed in the package, as I thought the CD and tape were of the songs, not a narration of the book"
3,good,"You are better off purchasing the limited edition, which comes with the cassette and cd. I found the limited edition set in Marshalls (after I made this purchase), for less than what I paid for just the book. I ended up giving my nephew this book and the casette tape which came with the limited edition. I kept the cd and other book for my son, who still reads along with the cd, a month after Christmas."
2,Kindle Edition,"I have to say as much as I love this story, the Kindle edition is extremely disappointing. As an e-book for children it is very overpriced. For the money, you simply get the text and illustrations. There is no read-aloud function or interaction. The illustrations are beautiful, of course, and it is nice that the text can be enlarged (although it then interferes with the illustrations). It would be much nicer if instead the illustrations could be enlarged and explored. All in all, this is a beautiful book that is better owned as a traditional book. As an e-book for children, it leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Polar express,Bought it for my granddaughter who loved it! Super book especially when read with cocoa and when in your pjs....
3,polar express,"i watch the movie every year,it is about a boy who is starting to not believe in santa anymore ,when this one magical night,this train rolls up called the polar express and stops outside his house and takes him on a journey to the north pole,along the way he makes friends and learns something also."
3,"OK book, not great","This has never been one of my favorite Christmas stories. I bought it for my husband our first Christmas after we got married since it was one of his favorites. This is a nice edition. The pictures are good and the book is a nice addition to any Christmas library. But personally, I've never understood why this is such a classic. I don't feel that there is much to the story at all. But, like I said, my husband loves it so maybe our kids will too."
5,a great gift for any child,"Any one should enjoy reading the Polar Express to any children. It can be a great gift for any child to start the holiday tradition of packing and unpacking lots of products as early as June, and turn that child into a great spender and consumer as soon as possible. However while reading this book a child can dream about the Christmas decorations, reading non-stop about imaginary Santa arriving on Christmas Eve while lots of his peers have not even a slice of bread on their tables, starving from hunger. It is an exciting book to brainwash your child and turn it into a little selfish monster."
2,"Hated it... being an outsider to the elite ""true believers"" group","When I ordered this book, I had never read it, but I had read the reviews and believed it was a must have for my nearly 3 year old son who is becoming excited about Christmas for the first time. I read it with happy anticipation, loving the warm tone and vivid descriptions on the trip to the North Pole and back, including when the boy finds the bell wrapped under the tree with the cute note from Santa. However, from that point forward, I hated it. His parents couldn't hear it, later his sister couldn't, etc., because they were not ""true believers""?! Ugh! Yuck too! To me, Christmas is about love, generosity, inclusiveness, a celebration of renewal, life, all children AND their families, not about celebrating being part of an elite group of true believers. I hated it; and I'm thrilled to have gotten rid of it."
2,stranger danger,"Much to my chagrin, my 4 year old son has this book and the movie practically memorized thanks to my husband and his mother. Why is it ok to teach children that getting out of their beds, leaving the house, and getting on a train with a stranger in the middle of the night is a grand, desirable, adventure? I threw out a similar story about leaving the house and flying through the air with a snowman last year. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is another example. I have been searching for a copy of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales to counter-effect the message. My goal in teaching my children about the world is to instill a healthy dose of caution at least, about going off with strangers, forget political correctness."
5,Very pleased with my purchase,Absolutely love the cd and ornament that came with the book! My students will be happy to hear someone else read the book other than me!
5,"Best purchase a volunteer ""Santa's Elf"" could ask for!","This was one of the best purchases I have ever made! It was much better than I expected and I will treasure it forever. I work as a volunteer with the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad and each year they do the ""POLAR EXPRESS"" train rides. This year I was to be a reader and wanted to make sure I had the story memorized ""just in case"". Thank you for your expert handling of my purchase."
5,LOVE!,"We all love this story & the movie has become a Christmas tradition for our family...this year, we watched it 4 times. Our son (just turned 5) also likes to watch it in the Spring/Summer, too."
1,great book but damaged when delivered,"this book is a wonderful classic Christmad book. However, I was extremely disappointed when I opened this book and many of the pages were damaged. I ordered several other books at the same time and their pages were also damaged. I have ordered books from Amazon before and this is the first time they have not been perfect when delivered."
5,great book,"You can't go wrong with the Polar Express.....its a Classic! Nice hardcover and great quality. My daughter really enjoys it, one of her favorites"
5,"if you buy one childrens book this holiday, this is it!",the polar express is the best holiday book that you can buy.Igive it an
5,Best Christmas Book,I love this book! It came in perfect condition and was delivered very quickly. I was very pleased with my order.
5,A Delightful Story to add to your Holiday Traditions!,"Just like we always read ""The Night Before Christmas"", my family has the tradition of reading ""The Polar Express"" on Christmas eve - snuggled in our pjs in front of the fireplace, drinking hot chocolate. The illustrations in this book are wonderful and the story, while simple, is a warm fuzzy! For us, this delightful book really helps set the mood for the holidays.I'm sure we will all go see the movie, but I still hope my children will look forward to listening to me read the book this holiday season.If you haven't read the book yet, pick up a copy and maybe start a holiday tradition in your family! I think you will really enjoy it!"
5,A New Classic,One of the truly beautiful Christmas stories...and even better and simpler than its film counterpart.
4,Beautifully illistrated,This book was giving to my 4 yr old grand daughter for Christmas. A CD was included with the book so my grand daughter could listen to it all by herself. The book is beautifully illistrated and the story is magical. It really gets one in the spirit of Christmas.
2,My mistake,"I bought this thinking it included the movie. I was wrong. The DVD only had a couple of songs from the movie. Luckily, we found the movie playing on AMC before Christmas Eve because we also got him the Lionel Polar Express Train Set for Christmas."
3,Good but not her best,"Tracy as comical and entertaining as always did her best work with State Of The Union. I guess being American it's easier to relate but I find her third season of The Union the best. I also purshed the seasons of Tracy Takes On that Ive missed and even though they made me laugh I still have to give State of the union thumbs up. I hope she comes back with more State Of The Union, Its just so easy to laugh at US. [[ASIN:B001D2WUB6 Tracey Ullman's State of the Union: Complete Season One]"
1,Teachers (and others): Avoid this edition!,"I had been happy to read about a supposedly unabridged and very inexpensive edition of ""Queen of Spades"" and the Belkin tales, as (as a college instructor) I often assign ""Queen of Spades"" in courses on opera or Petersburg, or in which one would not neces sarily need the student to order a whole compilation of Pushkin's fiction, such as Norton's very solid COMPLETE PROSE TALES.However, this edition is *far* from unabridged. The editor has taken it upon himself to cut not only ALL the epigraphs from ALL t he stories (an absurd economy which distorts the tone of these parodic stories) but also fails to provide the two-page ""From the Editor"" frame without which the purpose of the Belkin tales is obscured.I would not recommend this edition even to the casua l reader who wished to get the true flavor of Pushkin's Sternean, self-referential prose works. 'eo"
1,Hydronic Baseboard Heater,"Even with all of today's technology, hydronic baseboard heaters are not cost effective. The ratio of heat output to the electricity consumed makes electrical baseboard heaters a desperate last choice resort. The initial unit cost and lower installation cost may seem favorable, but because the heat output is very low and the energy consumption is very high the overall cost of ownership is high. Complete a cost benefit analysis before resorting to this heating alternative."
4,A Good Read!,"When you hire a corporate biographer, the result should be thorough, imbued with inside knowledge and, perhaps, a bit flattering. And so is this book, which was commissioned by Corning in conjunction with the firm's sesquicentennial celebration. As the title suggests, the focus of the book is on the innovational nature of the company and how Corning has capitalized on its creativity through flexible strategic responses to changing market demands. Although the corporate origins of the book cast doubts on its objectivity, we from getAbstract recommend Corning and the Craft of Innovation as an interesting case study in the management of a company that lives and dies with innovation."
3,"more of a picture book , than a manual for a fisherman",lots of pictures and diagrams. It does not though go deep into the subject.It covers mostly the marlin showing some nice pics
1,SORRY!,"Sorry, but this is just a Norah Jones record marketed to people who think they're too cool to admit they like Norah Jones. If you disagree with that statement you're just wrong. Feist also takes a pretty good crack at ripping off Sade as well on a few tracks. Go listen to the real thing instead."
4,I like someone who takes some risks,"This album was a little hard to get into at fisrt. But noiw, I'm really enjoying, and getting more out of each time I listen.Feist and her producers like to take risks: she sounds like Joni Mitchell in some songs, thenMadelien Peyroux, then the BEE GEES !!!! Ahhh. But I like the fact that she seems to be justt doing what she likes, and it sounds good to me.If you like your music to be instantly easy and not need much effort on your part, then a couple of the sogs will please you. But if you like to get your teeth into someting a bit different without being 'grating', then get into Feist."
4,Eclectic mood nuggets.,"I picked this album up basically because Amazon recommended it, and have been pleasantly surprised. I'm not going to rehash the whole album, but what I will do is play the comparisons game in a good way for those whose minds think like that.The songs on this album fit nicely together because of their softness. However, you can't fit this one as being x or y. The ""Mushabooms"" track has a sort of travelling folksy rhythm that reminds me Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Boxer"". Certain songs, like ""One Evening"" admittedly have a jazzier, strong and deep beat that could easily fit into a Sade album. Still other songs like ""Lonely Lonely"" are simple ballads that have allusions of Jeff Buckley (""Mojo Pin"", ""Hallelujah"", ""Lilac Wine"").Overall this is a tender but sexy album. The volume is tempered and gives off this feeling of vulnerability. A very human piece of work. Quite enjoyable."
3,Not what I expected,"I first heard feist a few weeks ago on the radio. The remix song intrigued me so I picked up ""let it die"".For half the songs, think Nora Jones meets Portishead. A few uptempo originals and a couple covers mixed with slow melancholy tunes.Although the vocals are beautiful, controlled and well timed; the rythms and instrumentals left me wanting more. I expected to hear an uptempo album but instead thought this CD was better for an evening with headphones on, lights off, winding down."
3,Disappointing,"I picked up this album on a whim. I had heard Feist on the Kings of Convenience album and enjoyed her voice. Her voice is the only thing I enjoyed on this album. The work lacks artistic coherence and bounces from jazzy compositions to 80s pop. Despite the impressive vocals, this fails to satisfy my musical expectations because it is not unique and lacks artistic depth and creativity."
2,I Repent,"I read that Feist was a sort of Norah Jones on steroids. I like Norah Jones but I'm not crazy about Norah Jones. I wanted originality. I wanted a jazz singer with a little more punch than Norah Jones. After making it through the first 8 tracks of Let It Die, I did.I've completely rewritten my review because this artist, Feist, is so good, you may not catch it at first. Listen a little more and her music grows on you---she infectous.Music has a new queen. Chrissy Hind, step aside."
3,Two stand out songs,I would rate the songs I like at 5 stars each but can't rate the cd any higher than a 3 since there are only two period. Her voice is sweet and velvety but I just don't play it that much.
2,Good CD but sounds too familiar,"Is it me or does anyone else feel like Feist is an Esthero rip-off? She is trying to copy Esthero's vocal style! Esthero is an original, often imitated but never duplicated. Feist fans....if you haven't heard of Esthero, take a listen and you will see what I mean."
2,"Hmmm, go back to Broken Social Scene and let this siht die, please","Fiest runs the gamut of musical styles from A to B on this record, from soul (ish) vocals to Norah Jones-like musings to out and out disco which was bad enough the first time - may the BeeGees rot in hell. I guess it's ok if you're an ""indie"" artist to regurgitate past musical styles that weren't too good to begin with and add a few electronic flourishes so you won't be accused of being too too retro and then add some dishpan shallow boy/girl lyrics and voila - pop genius! Fieist manages to be both sultry and sucky at the same time. Well at least all I lost was time having downloaded it, listened to it twice and deleted it. If mediocre modern pop is your thing then buy it but it's just not my bag, dad."
2,I am not impressed (except when singing in French),"Too much emphasis on her voice and not enough to songwriting dooms this set. Some of the tracks were so dull and lifeless. I've heard more passion, more joie de vivre from lounge singers in casinos. Yes, she sounds like Sade. I will say that I liked the one song she sang in French. I think I would have upped this album an additional star if the entire album were recorded not in English."
5,Female pop at it's best,"If I were asked to equate Leslie Feist to a mixture of other well-known female acts, it would break down like this: Take Sarah Mclachlan's voice, add a combination of Norah Jones' soothing melodies with Frou Frou's refreshing, bold and absolutely in-place pop arrangements, and stirr softly until even.What you will obtain is a merely brilliant album; one that approaches perfection not through complexity but through the simpleness of the conjunction of a great voice and all the right instruments. From the first track, an atmosphere of carefully intertwined sounds is created that will hold until the very last second and, most likely, linger on in your brain even after that."
4,a fabulous album,"This album is so lo-fi it could be background music, but Feist's voice and personal lyrics make her music impossible to tune out. Let It Die isn't overproduced and the instrumentation is given a backing role as to not overpower Feist's voice. That's the strong point, as she switches easily between smoky drawls and sweet pop licks. It's a laid-back album with elements of jazz, disco, and pop. The only thing keeping me from giving Feist 5 stars is because her own songs are much better than the covers."
3,Everything But the Thorn,"Not much to add to all the other love-it/hate-it reviews - you will/you won't. Me? I find it charming and harmless, and pleasantly reminiscent of the early Tracy Thorn/Marine Girls/Everything But the Girl stuff on Cherry Red. And am I the only one who thinks she should team up with The Notwist? One interesting music-historical tidbit: ""When I Was a Young Girl"" is in fact a pretty hip reworking of the ancient folk ballad ""Annie Franklin,"" aka ""The Unfortunate Rake,"" ""St. James Hospital,"" ""The Bad Girl's Lament,"" ""The Whore's Lament"" (I like Hedy West's version on her ""Love, Hell & Biscuits"" album), that eventually morphed into ""The Cowboy's Lament"" and then ""The Streets of Laredo,"" which was a huge Country & Western hit by Marty Robbins in the 60s. Interesting to see how these old songs travel through time and space, as well as between genders. Hey, there's a great set for some enterprising community radio dj..."
5,A mesmerizing journey of music,"An absolute dream. A wonderful musical feast from a very gifted songstress. Buy this record. The perfect mix of pop, soft rock, folk, jazz and yes, even disco. It's a perfect 10. The Reminder isn't bad either, but you want to start with this, and most likely you will stick with this...like I did."
4,Dig it.,"Good stuff. Although the music is different, it reminds me of the experience of discovering Portishead - something unusual, beautiful voice, interesting arrangements, not radio-edited.Highly recommended to those outside the fold. And those inside, you'd love it if you heard it 57 times a day on your favorite station, why not give it a try?"
4,"Please, give us more, Leslie Feist","More than anything, I absolutely fell in love with her slightly naive, young woman's, voice. Sexy, or what! I'd love to see and hear more from her. How about the Tonight Show for more, well deserved exposure, Leslie? Come on, Jay, this lady is in a class of her own."
4,Too Many Lovers Aint Good for You.,Got turned onto song from a dance performance on YouTube. Later read a good review in Esquire.Like the whole album
5,Jazzy and sweet,"This album is wonderful, sultry, jazzy, and somewhat folk. The instrumentation is very natural and earthy, with lots of rich texture. It is well mixed and incredibly soothing. I've heard many comparisons to Norah Jones, whom I also like, though I must disagree that Leslie sounds anything like Norah except that both women sing with gentleness. Musically they are nothing alike. My husband typically hates my cheesy chick easy listening music, but likes this Leslie Feist album for it's jazz elements."
3,Enjoying this CD Thoroughly!,"I hadn't even heard of ""Feist"" before my 16 year old son made me a compilation CD of various artists. I heard ""Mushaboom"" and was delighted. ""Who IS this?"" I asked him, and he told me. I felt so out-of-it, but also very happy to discover that not every female vocalist nowadays sounds like Minnie Mouse on speed, thank Heavens. There are some out there who can sing and who are not afraid to be a bit different than the mainstream. Her voice is unique, and Feist's style is hard to peg. I like that. I immediately went on Amazon, listened to some samples and read some reviews, then bought my first ""Feist"" CD. I have not been disappointed."
4,Good but not great,"I won't rehash the plot, other than to say it is about as plausible as any other film noir, and more understandable on a first viewing than, say, the Big Sleep. But it somehow lacks the monumental quality of that movie, mostly because of weaker characterization. Bogie has some great lines, and his performance carries the movie along. Lizabeth Scott smoulders, but never really catches fire, and her southern accent could use some work. The bad guys aren't quite bad enough, and the copper is a little too stock. Nonetheless, a tense psychological thriller that will not disappoint, and is worth watching more than once. One day, someone will write a book about why the forties produced so many gun-toting femme fatales. Statistically, men kill their women and not vice versa, although you'd never guess that from this genre. But hey, it makes for good (and sometimes great) cinema."
4,B level Bogey,"Humphrey Bogart, at his tough guy best, adds his usual flair to what otherwise would have been standard fare. Husky voiced Lizabeth Scott, a tepid version of Lauren Bacall, right down to her long wavy brown hair plays a femme fatale. She seduces Bogey who is attempting to exonerate an army buddy from trumped up murder charges in Gulf City, a racketeering friendly southern town. As in The Maltese Falcon, he won't play the sap and take the fall for the sexy babe.This movie seemed like a conglomeration of several previously successful Bogey features such as The Big Sleep and the previously mentioned Maltese Falcon. The greatness of Bogart almost pulls it off."
3,Not Bogies best film but Lizabeth Scott is Hot!,"The story just doesn't flow well. The saving grace of the film is that Bogie is Bogie and Lizabeth Scott is breathtaking in her slightly off center way. Not quite the fire between characters due to the story line itself, but the movie is more about Lizabeth and her wardrobe which saves the film from being a loss, not the fault of Bogie though, the story is just a bit too weird."
3,Dead Reckoning,More of the same for Bogy but with a little more (very little more) depth. It's amazing what writer's can make happen when they are the ones writing the action. A 1950's Saturday morning kid's show.
4,The best of the Columbia Bogie Noirs,"This is by far the best of the Columbia Noirs made with Bogart. Generally his Warner Brothers movies were superior. But I would recommend this this one to most any Bogie or Noir fan as a great example of the type.Generally speaking, Bogie needed Huston--and that's what's lacking from this film. Still worthwhile."
4,In memory of a beloved friend!,"""Dead reckoning"" is an effective Noir that runs with unerring rhythm, agile script and striking dialogues.Rip Murdock (Humphrey Bogart) assumes the investigation about the strange circumstances that surround the death of his friend Johnny Drake (William Prince). So, he will get into a web of intrigues, double crosses and double moral that even involves ""a prepared marriage"" for getting the money of a wealth man although Coral Chandler (Lizbeth Scott) is married with Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky).Meanwhile Rip will embody the epitome of the genuine Noir hero, committing himself respect the search and the minimum details of this dark case.Once more, Bogart is the show, he shines and carries on him the frantic script with his provocative and acidic comments about his ideal woman (encapsulated like a pill).Well acted, except by Lizbeth Scott,whose dramatic punch is not weak, but absent."
3,Good Start & Finish But Uninvolving Overall,"The bulk of this film, the middle of it, was just too slow for me, hence the so-so and somewhat-generous 3-stars rating. The beginning and endings were very good, especially several scenes in the final half hour. There were several twists concerning Lizabeth Scott's character that kept you guessing.There were other things going for this film, such as Humphrey Bogart's narration. He had a lot of good lines in here, either narrating or talking to others. He and Scott were the stars but some of the supporting players also were great, such as Morris Carnovsky as the tough-guy aide, ""Martinelli. "" Also, they may not be big names but Charles Cane, William Prince, Marin Miller, Wallace Ford and James Bell all added nice performance here.Yet, with all this going for it, I didn't find the film as involving as it should have been. It too flat in the middle of the film. Perhaps another look someone will change my mind."
3,Echoes of Bogart's earlier films,"Dead Reckoning will be enjoyed by any Bogart fan, though it's not one of his best films. Very nice to see his friendly enthusiasm with another character toward the beginning of the film, and that moment where he (almost)lets himself fall in love with the femme fatale near the end. I was fascinated by several instances where the writers directly lift dialog or scenes from Bogart's earlier films with Bacall and also from the closing scene of the Maltese Falcon. The film is not a parody, but it's borrowing so directly from others gives it a very interesting sense of deja vu, and makes the viewer wonder exactly what they were up to in doing this. I hadn't heard of the film before, so was very pleased to discover another film by Bogart many years after first watching his films on my little black and white set on Five All Night, Boston's first all-night station way back when!"
1,Dead Quality,"It pains me to see quality classics destroyed by garbage studios such as Columbia Tristar. They release horrible reproductions of your favorite classics only to re-release them one year later as a special edition. Do you think if write Santa this Christmas I might be able to get a widescreen release of this film or one with a better picture. The pigs at Warner are infamous for crappy reproductions. Is it time to feed the pigs more money and buy this release? No way, get yourself a good DVD decryption program, rent this DVD, and copy it! Thank GOD for piracy, the studios have been ripping off the consumer for years and now it's time to fight back! Also download the lastest movie release's off your favorite newsgroup.It's time to send the studios a meesage. Hail Criterion for there restoration work on some of my favorite films. The films from Criterion are worth every penny you pay for them!"
4,Suspense,"I really enjoyed this movie. I initially bought it because Adrian Paul is in it, but enjoyed it on its own. I was skeptical at first about the whole story taking place in the parking garage, but it worked. I enjoyed the suspense, unknown factors, twists & turns as well as trying to figure out the who and why. The flashback style was good in moving the story and added just enough to keep you thinking and guessing. It held my attention and interest throughout. I know my teenage son is going to love the action and suspense too."
2,"""Where did you park?""","Two unlikable characters plot a robbery of sorts (it's never seen but 10.6 million dollars is mentioned in passing). We have to take their word that they were successful. The movie, but for too many flashbacks, takes place in a parking garage of undetermined levels. People are few and far between and only provide fodder for the killer (an obvious choice among a limited cast). There's a lot of running, a lot of squealing tires, crashes galore, impossible stunts (I don't know of any person who could outrun a vehicle). Preposterous to the nth degree, very little makes sense. The main character/crook (Grayson McCouch) has several opportunities to kill the driver of the truck who's after him, but doesn't seize on any of these few chances. It's a slim plot stretched beyond its capacity to entertain."
4,exciting,"I have been a fan of Grayson McCouch for a very long time, he has the ablility to bring drama and realism to any situation just by his facial expressions. This is quite an interesting situation where he is literally fighting for his life and a couple of times it looks like he definately won't make it. The ending was a little silly because I don't know why his wife would be hunting him down so late, why didn't she try sooner to contact him. But I guess that wouldn't have made him the hero in saving her also. It wasn't a great movie, but it did keep me glued to the screen."
1,90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.,Why didn't he just wait by the doors for other cars to exit and then walk out?
5,Intense fast paced movie,"Wish Grayson McCough would make it big. He has great screen presence. This was a great movie. Same old same old theme, but it kept me at the edge of my seat. Pretty intense, I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Effective Thriller,"Grayson Mccouch is a yuppie trapped by a killer truck in an underground garage in this thriller obviously inspired by Spielberg's ""Duel"". Director James Seale knows how to create paranoia, suspense and terror."
5,Timi Yuro Amazing !,"Great essential covers CD ! Timi does 14 of the 18 songs originally by others. With her treatment it is wonderful. Particular favorites are It Hurts To be In love,It'a Only make Believe,and Only Love Can Break A Heart. Two Brenda lee songs are done well also,I'm Sorry and All Alone Am I. Fans will love it. I do !"
1,Not what I expected.,"I thought this was the original recordings, but not so. It sounds like a re-recording, and her voice is not what it used to be. I was most interested in the cut ""What's A Matter Baby"" and was very disappointed in the arrangement. I'm still looking for a copy of the original recordings."
2,just not the same,I was quite disapointed with this CD it seems to me they used songs that were not the actual recording used on the radio I'm not talking about taking an analog and turning it into digital I'm talking about the song itself her inflection of the words were not quite the same as the song when you hear it on the radio
1,NOT Original Recordings,"Beware of the ""Remember"" (Portugal) label which at times produces re-recorded material. This CD does NOT use the original hit recordings. Wish someone else and noticed this prior to my purchase. Instead, buy The Very Best Of Timi Yuro (25 tracks) (EMI Gold Records). Can tell by the ""ear"" and the song length of the recordings are much different than as shown by Billboard.You can't miss with European Labels such as Castle, Spectrum, EMI, Universal Music, BR Music, Ace, Bear Family, Raven (Australia), BMG Import (RCA), Castle Comm., Charly, DERAM, MCA, Polydor, Polygram, Recall Import, Repertoire, Sequel, UTV which ALWAYS master from originally licensed recordings."
3,Kalashnikov Rifles and Their Variations,"Not bad but not a ""Bible""Good picturesMuch more could have been written as book is now out of date"
3,"""Kalishnikov Rifles"" ok for tech info, not for comparison","This book has a decent, short history of the rifle and a somewhat thorough instructional section for breaking it down, cleaning and maintenance.Unfortunately, the main reason I bought it is because I am in the market to buy an AK-47 and wanted some guidance on comparing all of the various versions from the different countries. For that purpose the book is not very useful at all, because all it provides are some historical information and technical specifications for certain guns manufactured in each country (except the receivers!) without any comment at all regarding relative quality or why one might pick one over the other.In addition, the book includes a lengthy section on the AK-74, which is fine if that is what you are interested in, but I would have rather had more substantive information on the different versions of the AK-47."
3,Washed Out Pictures,"Indoors with flash, subject is often washed out with dark background. Outdoors pictures are always washed out/overexposed unless taken with telephoto."
1,It's not worthy even one star!,"I bought this camera as a gift to my mom and since then it became my worst nightmare! It breaks any time it wants, I guess more than thousands times in one year. I sent it back to Minolta's repair facility to get fixed but that didn't work either! I can't believe they can do this to their customer by just telling me""You just have to send it to us again and again till it is fixed""!Don't buy it unless you hate your self too much!"
1,Very Disappointed,"My husband and I only use our camera occasionally and have had many problems with it.Large Battery Drain, Poor Focusing, and Multiple Breakdowns. Most recently, our photos came out very dark.We telephoned Minolta and they were quite indifferent to the situation. They were supposed to send me a form via e-mail in order to file a complaint and have not followed through.We will not buy this brand again."
1,Can't believe only 5 Zoom Stops,"I was all set to buy this camera but one thing mentioned in the reviews confused me. Only 5 zoom stops? How can that be with a 150 mm zoom capability? Sure enough, I test drove it and the lens only zooms to 5 distinct zoom stops. You can't just zoom the lens as desired and stop it wherever you want (i.e. when you take your finger off the zoom, the lens stops where you want it to). Instead the lens adjusts backwards to the nearest pre-set stop (one of 5 available). I've never seen a zoom camera with such an incredibly bone-headed feature. Buy some other zoom."
3,Should I be disappointed??? : (,"I bought this set thinking that its features should be comparable to the Olympus Stylus Zoom 140 QD CG Camera or Canon Sure Shot Classic 120 Caption Kit. I was very impressed at the size and the kit, but I was surprised at its zoom feature. There are only 5 zoom steps!! Eventhough the zoom range is wide, 37.5 to 150, what good it does when the camera doesn't stop zooming where you want it to stop?!!?? Also, when zooming, the lens will try to adjust itself until it reaches one of the zooming steps. I think this is also a waste of the battery.I found out later that the Canon has at least 15 zooming steops, which is more than enought (plus it's cheaper.) and the Olympus also has more than 5 zooming steps. I should have made sure that I test the products before I buy them on the web.I haven't taken any picture yet.. Once I do, I'll let you know.. : )"
2,Poor flash made a difference,"I did all of my homework before I bought this camera, including checking out Consumer Reports, reading Amazon's reviews and talking to people who own the camera.I actually bought it to use at my best friend's wedding. The small amount of pictures I took outside were great. But the ones inside were so dark, I was so sad to see them. Although the zoom is impressive, the flash isn't. All of the pictures of my new friend and her groom were very dark and fuzzy.It also seemed like the subjects in the photo were always in the right lower corner of the picture. So possibly the accuracy rate isn't that good.Needless to say, I returned the camera."
3,By the numbers history,"The true story feels like less, when every scene feels over edited. Skimming a book is what this most resembles. A little depth would have been appreciated."
3,Glory Road: 3.5 stars,"Based on a true story, this is about a guy named Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) who coaches an all-black basketball team. When it comes time for the team to play basket ball games, they start getting [death] threats telling them to step down. This movie reminded me of ""Remember The Titans"" and how people can discriminate someone and emotionally bring them down. But nonetheless they have to keep doing what they're doing, to prove the discriminators wrong."
3,the actual story is more moving,"I don't be trusting when Disney gets there hands on a real topic such as movies as Glory Road,because just like Remember the Titians they tend to give it a Polish feel as to sticking with the realness at hand in the bigger picture. I enjoyed the Commentary&bonus section where the Players reflected what happen 40 plus years back. it opens your eyes that the events that happen weren't that long ago.the acting was hit&Miss. but the story is a must&a reminder of a not too distant past."
5,Best basketball movie,Received as scheduled. New movie. My 13-year-old grandson's fav movie!! Never could find it anywhere so was so glad to find it here and the price was great!! We had watched this movie years ago and he never forgot it. I always want him to be aware of history even though often in movies it is an abbreviated version. It still gives him the hunger to learn more and to realize that people sacrificed a lot to offer the freedoms we now enjoy. He was so excited when he received it in the mail. He invited friends over to watch it with him.
5,Entertaining and Educational,"This movie is a ""must-see."" Not only does it tell an inspirational story, it also paints a picture of where we were in terms of race relations just 40 years ago. It may be tough to watch, but this film is accurate to a fault. The late 1960s were a time of change and upheaval in this country. Every first broke down more walls, and this movie illustrates one such moment.I remember these times, and although I realize we still have a long way to go, we have come a long way since Coach Haskins made his personal stance. Thanks Coach, and thanks to the members of that team, black and white. You've made us all proud all over again."
2,An atlas it's not,"An atlas is generally defined as a collection of maps and charts. Calling the Smithsonian Atlas of the Amazon an ""atlas"" is a bit of a stretch. It is more a compilation of statistics about the region; useful and interesting to be sure, but not an ""atlas"" in the conventional sense. I was looking for detailed maps and charts of the region. You will not find them in this ""atlas."""
4,Very interesting.,I'm not really into lip balm and I have to admit i never noticed the caffeine boost so I would have givin it 3 stars. However my boyfriend liked the taste and smell of it on my lips plus it makes a great conversation piece. So for that ..4 stars.
5,It was perfect and fitted within my budget.,I am gald I was able to get this book and it fit with my budget perfectly and I am glad that I got it.
3,Not a desert island recording,"This is not a recording to take to that desert island, if you can only pack the essentials. Nina's voice is okay but with the recordings of Jesse Norman and Kiri Te Kanawa still very much in-print, why bother with this one. Nina sounds like a Bayreuth house soprano and her rendition is in no way startling or original. Just adequate. Skip this recording and buy one of the other two."
1,Disappointing,"Let's get this out of the way quickly. Those seeking masterly interpretations of these often recorded songs (R Strauss' Four Last Songs) need to visit the Sinopoli/Dresden with the diamantine Cheryl Studer. It does not get any better than that. Besides, you get unparalleled accounts of Wagner's Wesendonk-Lieder and a Liebestod (from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde) for the ages."
2,Not great,"Since I love Strauss I decided to purchase this CD and although I will refrain from making a final judgement until I hear her live my initial reaction was one of disappointment. In the history of opera there have been so many voices that records couldn't do justice to and that were much better heard live. Lets hope this is one of those instances. After listening to the CD she reminds me of a voice similar to Inga Bork's; a big clunky voice that manages to hit all the notes but that doesn't move me at all. Inga Bork had a big career so maybe hers too was a voice that had to be heard live. I don't know I guess I will wait and see. Now, if you really want to hear someone amazing singing the same repertoire try buying a record or attending a performance of Anne Schwanewilms, now that is a voice that will BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF!!!"
1,not all there,"i did not like this video. I was looking for something that was going to really target my abs, but this just didn't do it for me. I've been to many instructor lead ball classes and have never seen half the stuff she tried to do in this one. I hope there are better one out there."
5,"simple to follow, great instruction","when it comes to doing ab crunches or any type of ab work, expecially when using my stability ball, i find alot of the videos to be to hard or too difficult to follow....not true with this video, Leisa Hart is a fine instructor who is very simple to follow, she is easy to listen to and gives great tips to watch for safety...my abs are getting into the defined range after just 3 weeks...when my husband see's my get out of the shower and towel up, he is amazed that he is seeing results from my doing exercise videos....and all of the videos I use now are Leisa Hart's videos...I love all of her stuff, and definitely recommend this one as well."
5,"great pace, abs felt it","I loved the pace that Leisa Hart uses in this stability ball workout. She is the Abs of Steel guru, and you can tell in this modern workout. She goes slow and emphasis deep breathing while holding certain moves. My abs felt it, it was awesome. I am a beginner, and this was perfect for me. I highly recommend it!"
5,doing ab crunches has never been easier,"my wife bought this tape and loves it...she already had a big ball, and this is by far te best beginners ball workout for the abs. Hart is great looking and toned up, and she inspires my wife to work smarter, not just harder. This is the perefect ab ball workout."
2,Where is the Kat we know and love?,"I haven't bought this CD, but I have heard samples of Dangerous. I like the song, but that's not where I'm going. What is she wearing???? I've seen her new cover for her debut, and this cover, and all I can say is what was Kat thinking???!!!! She needs to put some clothes on in this one, and her other one is just plain sleezy. Done. What happened to the nice, fun, gentle girl from American Idol? Suddenly, it's Trash City. Where's the Kat we know and love? I give it two stars for the songs."
4,"Terrible clothing choice, great songs!","I loved Kat on AI, and I thought that she was really good. Now, I look at her on her CD covers, and I don't even know if it's Katharine or not. I have to pinch myself to realize that she is actually dressing like that. Apart from the terrible clothing choice (on both this cover and her debut album), the songs are actually very good. My favorite is Dangerous but I Lost You is also very good."
3,"I Lost You is a Gem; Dangerous, A Bore.","3 Stars(2.5 precisely) for one excellent song and one mediocre. Katharine has a beautiful and adequate voice when she isn't drowned out by studio production. Dangerous is very mundane, and I wouldn't be able to recognize it if I heard it on the radio. Neither of these two songs are going to be on Katharine's debut album, which is probably a wise decision. Although, throwing I Lost You on there wouldn't hurt."
5,Love this sleeve,This was purchased for my iPad so I could take on trips and it's very durable and functional. Could have used a shoulder strap but worked fine.
3,Sports Clock,"When I first decided to purchase the clock I had hoped that it was going to be durable enough to with-stand my husband's ""less than gentle ways"".The clock seems durable enough; although the hands aren't covered, so if something is knocked into it, it could do damage to the hands. Once hung up and out-of-potential trouble, the clock works well and goes great in his 'man-cave'."
5,Hopper,"I have not finished reading this long biography, but so far it seems to explain the stark puritanical style of many of Hopper's paintings."
2,Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography,"I was disappointed in the Hopper book because it seemed to dwell excessively on the misogynistic character of the man. Yes,it exposed him as a spoiled, jealous tyrant, a fact of history, but failed to connect the reader with the processies of how he painted, the mechanics of the development of a painting, how he went about it, what did he do first, why ?, etc.. Bill McEnroe"
1,Much ado about nothing....,"A very long book about a very uninteresting man that painted flat lifeless pictures, and who was a pig to his wife...save your money....take your wife to dinner with the money this book costs!"
4,My 3-year-old is obsessed with Moonboy,"I'm not even sure how we got this book -- it's even autographed by the author to someone with my same name, but I'm certain I'd remember.... In any case, the first bedtime that I hauled this one out for my 3-year-old boy was some kind of turning point in his life or something. He had to sleep with it, and have it read to him several times a day, and he also began ransacking his bookshelf for more books like it. This last part was nice -- there were several books that he wasn't interested in before but now he's more open.So, while I find parts of the book tedious (like the page about the Shinys), I have to give it a a good rating just because it rekindled my son's interest in books."
5,I Love the Bar Method !!!,"This dvd altho is an older verson of the Batr Method it still i find a useful part of my collection!i have been using this for aboiut 3mos along with the new version of designer sculpting and the ""fat free""dvd since i purchased this one with it.i enjoy them and definitely see changes in my hips and thighs my knees are not sore in the morning when i get up and my clothes are fitting loser i do use ""core Fusion""with thise dvd""s and cardioi 3times a week .all in all the Bar method is instructional and it does not lie i have seen changes u must do it 3-4times a week tho if u want those changes it will not let u downjoann plaag"
3,"I didn't want to talk bad about you, Burr...","but I really just want you to stop talking. Yes, I feel the burn. Yes, I remembered to tilt. No, you don't need to talk at me while I am holding this insanely uncomfortable position w/out actually doing anything.The DVD is a great work out, I'm not negating that. I just need her to come up with a better way to explain the postures w/out wasting time and energy.Also, the workout seems to be afraid of its own potential in some ways---reluctant to build muscle.Buy it...mute it."
5,Fabulous Leg Workout,"Though this is a total body workout, the emphasis is really on the legs. The arms and abs sections are pretty short but the leg and seat sculpting is about 20 min. and there's a bonus segment that's about 7 min long with standing exercises for the thighs, butt and calves. The small pulses really work deep into the muscles. I'm not flexible and had trouble with one of the exercises: the pretzel. I hurt my hip and back doing that one so I skip it. I still get a great workout with the standing sculpting series and the bridge work. This non-impact workout with the stretches throughout really elongate your legs. This workout is similar to Lotte Berk Muscle Eats Fat - but it is MUCH better!"
4,Selected Poems,"Selected poems by Attila Jozsef are truly life. Life sometimes can be complicated, no answers, no exits or not to many choices. In many cases we are put against the wall and with no escape from our choices, but death. Death is liberal, is the only thing in life that you don't need permission to do. Death is the last open door at the end of a dark hallway full of locked rooms. I think Attila Jozsef speaks his mind; his issues brought him to depression and to look for peace. In his poems he describes how life can be good but also very cruel. He finds a solution not accepted by many, is a word that causes panic, fear, anger and makes people to look back in their lives top find out the good things they possessed: suicide. His poems are very descriptive, Attila doesn't miss a single detail of his emotions, and he puts them clear but with a shadow so you can search deep inside. I found the poems are very intelligent well written with lots of abstract emotions and sentences."
4,Selected Poems,"Selected Poems by Attila Jozsef is a very intense captivating book of poems. Selected Poems captures all the poets' inner feelings towards the world, his childhood, and poverty. Jozsefs expresses through dark images of his life and problems he encountered as a child. One of his life changing experiences mentioned is the abandonment of his father at the age of three. Attila also discusses about living in an orphanage and always living in extreme poverty. The poet Attila Jozsef encounters many scars during his years in this earth; the deepest wound he must have suffered had to been the lost of his mother. In his poems you are able to see the essence of loneliness and suffering that was cause by his mother's death. Although at times raw of the subjects he speaks of, I believe he is preaching his life and story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys intense reading and who finds it a challenge to feel personal poetry."
4,Selected poems,"Jozsef's poems are a view of the other side of life. Unlike most of the poems I've read that usually has a positive view on life. Although Jozsef has a dark vision because of his tormented life I think his use of words, are descriptive beautiful and intense.It made for great poetry.When ever I read poetry or a story I try to grasp a moral or a lesson even if the author intended it or not. In this case I don't believe the poet intended a lesson with his poems. I learned from the poems are how obsession can consume your life. Yet that it needs to be expensed.Peter Hargitai's translation of these poems truly captures the poet's raw emotions. He did try to impress the reader with big words or did he try to over polish the poetry the Jozsef wrote. His translation makes it seem the poet wrote of his poems in English instead of his native language. His Poetry was modern when he wrote it, almost too modern for his time. His work wasn't really appreciated until later on."
4,Selected Poems,"Selected Poems is a book of poems by a great Hungarian poet Atilla Jozsef. This book was translated by Peter Hargitai to celebrate Atilla Jozsef's hundred-year anniversary. Attila Jozsef lived a very short and sad life; he took his own life at the age of 32. The majority of the poems that were chosen by Mr. Hargitai were very strong and very angry poems. He mostly wrote about his strong feelings of disappointment and hatred toward his mother, except for one poem were he speaks of how he forgave her for all of the ways that she hurt him He also wrote a lot about his country of Hungery and the women he had in his life. Peter Hargitai did a magnificent job of translating the poems and of selecting very powerful and inspiring poems."
4,Attila Jozsef: Selected Poems,"The Translation of ""Attila Jozsef: Selected Poems"" is a marvelous book full of exquisite poems. The poems flow togeather with the theme of each individual section which the book is divided into. Peter Hargitai is an outstanding translator with a remarkable capability of word usage and and poetry empowerment that show the quality of his knowledge and experience as a poet. This collection is undoubtedly worth the time to sit down and read thoroughly. Attila Jozsef's poetry revolves mainly around love. His passion and longing for the perfect love to listen to her, to reach for her, to have her near as to have her far. Hargitai captures all of Joszef's feelings into the translated poetry which inso invole his self issues as well as issues with family during th communist era. His poetry is personally captivating and that is why I give it four stars."
4,Attila József Selected Poems Review,"Attila József poems are the reflection of his life in Hungary. Attila had a very traumatic childhood. His father left the house when he was only 3 years old, and a few years later his mother sent him to live with foster parents; in addition, World War I was also starting. These events explain why some of his poems are so despairing. But there are also numerous love poems, mostly dedicated to all of the lovers he had during his short life. The language of the poems is very direct, especially when he writes about death. The poem that I liked the most was ""On My Birthday"" mainly because it was witty and ironic. He was expelled from his school for having written ""With All My Heart"", yet later he became one of the most recognizable poets in Hungary and in now, hopefully, in the world."
2,Selected Poems,"These poems are written by the Hungarian Attila Jozsef. We can see Attila very deep feelings through his obsession with his mother, believing that life was nothing, so death was his freedom. He never could have what he wanted. That is why he is always negative about life. Some of the poems are related with his obsession with his mother and the book is mainly reproaching about life. It is sad to believe he threw himself under the wheels of a freight train. When I read this poem, I felt very sad. These poems are very depressing. These poems were written in times of the Great Depression in the thirties of the 20th Century. To understand better these poems we must understand it context. I would give 2 stars out of 5 because I do not like these kinds of depressing poems."
1,"""Big Apple"" definition in NYC book is all wrong!","PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK (OR ANY LET'S GO BOOK). Professor Gerald Cohen and I solved ""the Big Apple."" There is a Big Apple Corner street sign & plaque at W. 54th & Broadway, and we've been in other travel books. The book has the old jazz ""Big Apple"" theory and never mentions horseracing and John J. Fitz Gerald, who popularized the term in the 1920s. Buy other guides instead.EN"
2,Disappointed,"not long enough to fit driver comfortably, I kind of had to shove it in there, my golf bag barely fit into the case itself, I expected it to easily fit."
5,"Tastes great, easy to make","Tastes great and easy to make in about 15 min. You will need a 6 oz can of tomato paste, olive oil and 1 3/4 cup water. But other than that tastes great, good for a serving for a family of four. Great alternative to storing big jars of sauce in the cabinet!"
4,Great spaghetti thickener,I add this product to a jar of already to use spaghetti sauce and it makes it wonderfully thicker and bolder. I recommend it all the time when having company for dinner.
5,diabetes heaven,"This is a very good and hearty product. It's easy to take to work or camping. Nice consistency. It has the diabetic exchange values listed on the package, so it's easy to keep track.Best of all this taste great"
3,Not so sure...,"I purchased these as a healthy easy alternative meal starter for my diabetic grandfather. He said that he did enjoy the flavor and saw no unusual spike in his blood sugar readings.The meal itself was easy to prepare, I served it over the Ensavor Garlic rice and he was able to have two meals from that combination.It's healthier than most frozen meals and he definitely enjoyed a change but I'm not sure if the cost will prohibit me from ordering again or not."
5,Something Special,"The title track I feel is the best. However, I love them all. I had this LP over forty years ago and think it is definitely one of her best and I played it constantly then.I would recommend it to anyone over 45 but it would also appeal to many younger ones who just love good music and vocals which one can understand.Of course, it is a must for every Shirley Bassey fan."
5,Something by Shirley Bassey,Another great CD with great tracks.This also brought back memories as I used to own the LP some 20+ years ago.I highly recommend this CD.
5,Impressive feature debut for a talented filmmaker,"I've followed Krik's earlier works in shorter formats--and have always been impressed with the compelling creative consistency of Krik's cinematic voice. ""Able Danger"" is definitely a feather in the cap worthy of this director on the rise."
1,Horrible Boring Piece Of Crap,"This isn't inventive or creative filmaking. It's just the ramblings of someone who thinks he's exposing ""the truth"". His truth happens to be the demented product of his own delusional mind. If you enjoy this, you probably believe in every conspiracy theory that shows up on the internet. How about living in the real world for a change? Beyond that...it's just a bore."
2,watch something else instead,The blurb and preview captured my attention but the movie was plain boring. There was some good acting here and there but the story is flawed and jumbled and the movie runs out of steam pretty quickly.
3,It's all in the translation.,"This book was assigned reading for an Art History course. It's not something I would recommend reading for pleasure, but I wanted to suggest to others considering picking up a copy of this book that they choose the edition translated by Robert Baldick (Penguin Books, 2003) over the one translated by Maragret Mauldon. Baldick's writing is so much more readable than Mauldon's translation. I was really surprised at what a difference there was in the texts."
5,Incredible novel!,"I read this novel for a course on the era of Decadence, and fell in love with Huysmans' writing. The imagery he uses is incredible, and the theme of subversion throughout the novel is intriguing."
4,tmilledge,"It arrived in a timely manner but had more wear than it had said. While this was disappointing, the book itself is amazing. The best of the decandence era. I reccomend this book to anyone who can appreciate art for the sake of art."
2,"A novel book, whose novelty wears thin quickly.","I had to read this book for a class, but didn't finish it. It does have some interesting moments, like the turtle he decorates to match his carpet, but with no plot the novelty of the absurdly eccentric main character grows tiresome quickly. If you're looking for something odd to read this is fine, but not something to really pick up for enjoyment."
5,A Primer on 1920s Architecture & Interior Design,"I purchased this book after buying my first home, a 1920 Colonial Revival, looking for inspiration on designing my interior spaces. I greatly admire the residential architecture of this period.This book provided me a wonderful overview of various house styles popular during that era. The architects also provide commentary for their designs, which include great drawings and pictures of floorplans, as well as ideas for decorating the interior spaces and landscaping.It proved to be an excellent resource in carrying out my renovation project. If you love early 20th century homes, this is a valuable book to add to your library."
2,not what I expected,I was expecting a guide on how to identify different types of wildflowers; this was a nice book featuring pretty photography.
2,Not as Advertised,"The book was in good condition - that is not my issue. My issue is that the seller advertised it as the collector's edition, but the book sent was a regular paperback issue without the author's signature. I paid a little more for the collector's edition and could have bought a regular paperback for a lower price as several of those were available."
5,The Killers,"Excellent adaption from Hemmingway story. Delves into the non-existent past of the Swede. Great film noir complete with disjointed narrative, extreme light/dark contrasts, unusual camera angles and sketchy characters abound. Burt Lancaster is top-notch in his debut film at 32. Ava Gardner is the femme fatale. One of her better films."
4,To Save a Land,"Rustled cattle, embezzlement and land theft are just some of assignments Espy Norwood has to clear up out on a Texas ranch where trouble lurks behind every tumbleweed. Yet more lay behind Norwood--his past of hard-drinking, his wife's death, and a son he hope to regain....Colonel Judkins had given him a tough job. Could he follow through? Elmer Kelton at his early best."
2,"The Only Way to Learn About Relationships, volume 5","Information isn't easily found in this book - it is given hodgepodge & helter skelter - and most of the time, not at all. You would think you could read all about the affect your lover's natal planet(s) being in your 6th house, for example, has on you - wrong. She gives some example about one of her clients who has Gemini on the 6th house, and that's it! It's the same throughout the book - she gives examples about clients she has had and doesn't explain thoroughly how each planet in each house system affects you. I wouldn't recommend her books if you are looking for a clear & concise way to find information."
2,poor flash photography,"I've never seen anything like it. My photos looked like they were taken with a filter that darkened the right and/or left sides of the image. Same problem indoors or outdoors, with flash and wide angle. Also not happy with the sharpness of the focus."
1,What a disappointment...,"I guess I'm the exception in reviewing this camera... The Minolta Freedom Explorer EX Panorama has a nice design, lightweight, great features including zoom, panoramic, date, remote, and multiple flash modes -- if only the pictures were as good! I was very disappointed in the photo quality of the Minolta Freedom Explorer EX. Photos were grainy and not very sharp. Pictures came out darkish (yes, the flash was on) -- even on daytime outdoor shots!I decided to forego the panoramic and zoom for better picture quality -- So I exchanged my purchase to the top rated Yashica T-4 Super (with a Carl Zeiss lens)."
3,I kind of get it But...,"This film is considered a western and rightfully fits into the genre as it involves lots of revolers and rifles(with unlimited amuntition)being fired from horseback and behind saloon counters in an isolated desert setting. The classic western movie morals don't come into play in this film however.There is no hero or message of virtue and values found in this work. It is simply a tale of greed, deciet, sadism and perversion.Even though this film is a little rough around the edges as far as dialouge and special effects are concerned, it is probably a fairly good depiction of how things realy were in the wild west. Women degraded and abused, men raped, money stolen and loyalties uncertain at best.All in all a film worth checking out."
2,Bad pacing destroys this Spaghetti.,"There are many interesting aspects to this film, but unfortunately the pacing and anti-climax sink it. The first half hour is sadistic brilliance, including a great scene of bullets being removed from a man's stomach and some disturbing scenes involving a lynch mob hanging and shooting a group of outlaws. Then it slows down...a lot. Nothing happens for about an hour, and then it inexplicably ends. ""Cut Throats 9"" and ""The Hunting Party"" are two far superior exercises in Western sadism."
4,unfortunately not in the box anymore,"how great would it be if Blue Underground's Spaghetti Western collection would still be in print.Well, now you can buy all those Films seperately. And they make a great addition to any Western fan's collection"
3,Animals,"This is a very random, mix bag of a movie. There are some scenes that are simply brilliant(the opening in particular raised my hopes high), but then there are others that are beyond bad - The attack of stock footage animals stands out here. The story and characters are bizarre and its often hard to understand their motives. In the end, this feels like one big experimental film. Worth a look for the curious and for some interesting moments, but don't expect to be engaged in it."
3,It was okay,"For the record it is not Django Kill, he does not carry a unique gatling gun. This movie is really called ""Oro Hondo"" (meaning ""Deep Gold"" in Spanish and Italian) or ""If You Live Shoot!"" in most countries in Europe. The movie is kindof creepy, still the movie could have been better. For example, the love scene didn't really out the movie together, the dubbing needs lots of work, the theme music was in some scenes constantly(kindof annoying) but the plot was just okay (just could have been better). The only reason why I gave it three stars was because of Tomas Quintin Rodriguez aka Tomas Milian."
1,Suckest Western Movie I ever seen,What can I say of something that bad?This movie sucks.I waste my money and time buying this pathetic movie.
1,Men and women are both from Earth,"I ordered this book because of the good reviews it got from other readers, but I was disappointed when I got it. It is yet another book that comes from the viewpoint that men are thinkers and women are feelers -- there is an entire chapter titled ""When Men Don't Feel"". This may work well when a thinker and a feeler are paired up together, but it's useless otherwise. If you are looking for a fresh perspective on male-female relationships, this isn't it."
5,"Timely, much needed info to keep relationships on track","This book takes up where Dancing in the Dark leaves off, giving the reader very insightful, and informative ways of coming to grips with relationship problems in the moment....helpful information to stop painful patterns of relating and put new healthier behavior into place immediately. This is a must read for all embarking on a second marriage so that the painful patterns of the past don't wreak havoc in the new relationship. The Moseley's have a knack of finding the exact source of the pain and then give the reader many helpful ways to start the relationship in a much more healthy direction."
4,"Excited ""new owner""","I just got my camera and it's the first SLR camera I've owned.This camera has many, many features and options and I am learning how to fully operate it. I find the instruction manual easy to understand, its light weight and easy to handle.In comparing it to my Nikon point and shoot.... Well I can't. If your looking for your first ""real camera"" try the Minolta STsi.The picures are incredible."
5,GREAT CAMERA-MODERATE PRICE,"I bought this camera for my wife, who wanted a better camera than her standard non-focusing, ""gives-ya-red-eye"", ""cheap"" 35mm camera. She was tired of pictures being out of focus---etc.She took 5-10 minutes to look over the manual, and started taking pictures within minutes. She is very pleased with how easy this camera is to use. She now takes this camera (joyfully) to all family functions, as well as at home-and prefers it (for now) over our basic digital camera. It's a great starter camera,(for the price & the functions) having manual or auto-focus -which is great when I need to use it, and I'm not wearing my glasses!"
4,Happy with my new camera!,"I've been using an SLR for ten years that does not have any manual features, so I thought it was finally time to upgrade for more flexibility. I've tested this camera indoors and outdoors, with different speeds of film and the results have been very good. If I use the automatic features, the results are foolproof. I look forward to learning how to make the most of the manual features, and testing out different lenses. My old camera was rather heavy, and this one is noticeably light-weight. In the few weeks I've been using it, this Minolta seems well worth the money!"
4,"Tough decisions,",based only on the information from Amazon.com. I haven't bought any camera for the moment but I strongly recommend to all of you to go to see the Minolta web site to understand what are actually the differencies between their models and decide for which one you want to spend your [money].
2,Don't buy this camera.,"I bought both Canon Rebel G and Maxxum STsi, just want to find out which one I like better. STsi comes nowhere closer than Rebel. Under same condition and using same type of films, STsi's color, sharpness and balance are much poorer than Rebel. Sometime STsi looks like it doesn't know where it should put its focus on...Get a Cannon or Nikon."
3,Not good for proffesional,"This Camera s quiet good for learner because the feature is simple. But if you wan tot used manual shoot you will have a problem. Event it's offering the manual Aperture and Speed but it's difficult to use. The feature is close to the automatic pocket camera. The differentiation is only the lens because we can use the Minolta series of lens from 80 m to more. If you want the camera with automatic adjustment for aperture, speed and focus, and want to take a best shoot with various lenses, this is appropriate for you. But when you start using manual adjustment you will have a problem."
4,need info,Could anyone tell me if the date imprinting is on the front or on the back of the photos? Thanks so much.
1,Very Poor Printing,"I thought that this hardback volume would offer a high quality edition of this work. This is not the case. This is a very poor printing of this work. The paper quality is similar to newsprint or industrial paper towels. The print quality is also inferior; there is much blurring and smudging. Often, whole pages are ink-tinged like photocopies. Most disappointing are the reproductions of the artwork. There are no color reproductions and the black & white reproductions share the same faults as the printing of the text."
2,"Nice stories, strange appearance on Kindle","This is the oddest looking ebook I have ever seen. I looks as if it was typed on an a typewriter, with evenly-spaced equal-width letters, but the margins are justified, so there are spaces of various widths between the words. The typeface and spacing cannot be changed using the Kindle's controls.Nonetheless, this is an interesting book, more novelistic than the typical fairy tale presentation (Andrew Lang's, for example). For $2.99 I am willing to put up with the appearance. The black-and-white reproductions of the illustrations are reasonably clear."
4,Almost Point-N-Shoot,"I bought this while on vacation without a camera, possibly not the best time to break-in a new one. When first 3 rolls were developed I was able to see a progression of clearer pictures and now I'm completely comfortable watching the flashing green light in the view-finder for the optimum photograph. The compact size fits in a jeans pocket while knocking around historical sites. The 3 photo sizes allow for a vast array of shots and the zoom is fairly quick to adjust before the subject gets tired of smiling for the picture. Automatic dating and even a memo can be programed to print on the back of prints."
3,Quality comprimised by size,"I've had this camera for two years and although it is compact and light - easy to carry around anywhere withought being a nuisance, I've had several problems with it. The picture quality isn't very good - my pictures oftentimes come out hazy (indoor and outdoor). Also, no matter which view I put the camera in - it also prints out in panoramic view. Quite annoying since I've never had a need for panoramic pictures. I probably would not buy this camera if had the choice now."
3,well protected body,"This is good product, I am using this since two months. I like most its protection. It really help me while I am traveling. Result from this camera are also good."
2,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with this item. It wasn't, but should have been, listed as a unisex item. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker. When I received it, I realised that this was more likely to fit a man. The sleeves were way too long and wide. Even though there is a velcro strip, when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist,it flares out like a skirt.....not flattering. In my opinion, this jacket would be a much better fit for a man. If you're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman, in any size, I wouldn't reccommend this. I was also dissapointed with the lining. It was a flimsy net. All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket. It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you'd leave in the trunk of your car, but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one."
5,You can be dry AND look fly,"These coats are sweet! I got the green one and the natural colored one. The rain coat is very rain proof. I would say 97-99% rain proof in bad weather, 100% rain proof in moderate rainy weather. You will like it because of the style. It can be a bit hot on a warm rainy day, and it can get a little smelly if you don't hang it up to dry after each use and periodically wash it. but it looks so good these things are small matters in consideration of how dry you will stay, and how stylish you look!"
3,"A ""sloppy"" jacket","First I'll confirm that you should go a size smaller. I usually wear a Large in shirts & so I decided to go with a medium size. Still too big. At times it feels like an XL size. I may be better off with a small but then the sleeves will just be too short.The jacket is just made big, regardless of size. I see this as ideal for the bigger gentlemen working at ports or docks, not really idea for average gents. The excess fabric can make you feel like a kid in dad's jacket but it'll definitely keep you dry. It's very rugged & fairly simplistic but I can't see myself recommending this to anyone other than my husky friends."
2,port authority-seattle slicker,I ordered size M for my husband. And it's bigger than he needs. He usually wears M-L. Small will be better. Don't like fabris at all/ Rough material. Very heavy.
1,Disappointed overall,"I purchased this set with the Insect Lore Painted Lady Butterfly Activity Cards. Set was supposed to come with 72 pieces and we only got 68. There is not enough pieces to complete the activity cards, even if we did get the 72 pieces. For example: On many activity cards, 3 'charactors' of the same color are needed and only 2 of each color was provided and there are 6 different colors. In short, this set is useless if using it with coordinating Activity Cards. I would also say this set is too big and chunky for kids 4 years old and up. I'll be sending Activity Cards and Count and Sort Set back to Amazon. Disappointed."
5,Great idea!,"I read The Sacred Romance awhile back and loved it, so when I found out that there was a workbook to go with it, I just had to have it! Haven't had a chance to complete it yet, but everything I've ever seen of John Eldredge's stuff is great! I'm definitely looking forward to it and just having looked through the book it looks like he did a really good job with it."
2,Couldn't relate,"I found myself reaching to answer these questions, in the spirit of being cooperative....almost making mountains out of molehills as I viewed my life."
5,Amazing,"So much better than the book. I was confused after many of the chapters in the book, and the journal helped clear it up. Very glad I bought it- such a fan of John Eldredge, he had completely changed the way I view God."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I like that it comes apart and can be easily washed. Who hasn't scraped stuff out of a Kong with a chopstick? It smells weird and I don't like that it's from China, as I worry about lead and other yucky stuff in toys from China. I cut Bil Jac's in half and stuff them inside, it takes my dog awhile, but not very long, to get them out. Because it a big toy and pretty sturdy I feel ok leaving it in her crate with her during the day. I think it would take an agressive chewer to get the two sides to pop out from each other and open it completely."
1,Make No Mistake: This Is NO Trailshoe,"These shoes are a disappointment. I really wanted to like them but they just don't cut it for any kind of offroad trail walking. They have no grip on damp rocks, let alone wet or mossy ones. The high footbed and vent cutouts leaves you with little ankle support. Also, they don't breath despite all the holes, especially in the toe, which causes sweaty blistery toe rubbing. :-( Overall, the biggest drawback is the awful grip. If you plan on walking anywhere remotely wet please AVOID."
5,Another very good Keen sandal,"Keen shoes and sandals are rock solid. The Arroyo is one more excellent product. Heavier than other sandals, but just substantial and will last and last. I specifically shop for Keen products since they are uniformly outstanding and comfortable."
2,loose fitting,"I find these shoes to be slightly larger than the size indicated causing a looser fit than I desire and this problem is compounded by the fact that the spring in the cinch tab is not as strong as needed to hold the laces tight. Walking no more than 100 feet causes the laces, and therefore shoes, to become uncomfortably loose. If I had not mistakenly discarded the box, I would have returned the shoes."
5,Keen Hiking Shoes,This product was recommended to us by a friend. We found a better price on Amazon versus the product's web site. The shoes arrived quickly and my husband has been wearing them ever since! He's very happy.
5,"Best in quality, comfort, function",Excellent for its purpose; perfect in comfort; sturdy construction; even better than it looks in photos
2,Seems like a great sandal but size was very large,"I was disappointed since I really liked the look and tread of this product. I have a pair of Keens that are 4-5 years old and I've worn them out. I wanted a new pair with better traction since I do some light hiking in with my Keen's on. These were perfect... however, when they arrived they were the right size but WAY too big. My foot was not snug in them & moved around even with the laces pulled as tight as possible. Then with the laces pulled so tight, the extra lace at the top was huge and would flop around. There is no place to secure or tuck in the top lace which seems to be a design flaw to me. I have fairly narrow feet so maybe that was the problem. Though I do not typically have issues with shoe size. I ultimately returned these Keen's to Amazon."
5,Outstanding product!,"Nothing but good things to say about these! Fit well, great construction, wear well, comfortable, durable and stylish! These are a must for the outdoors enthusiast!"
2,The only connection is they have the word 'toy' in the title,"""The Toy Box"" (aka ""The Orgy Box"") might have been a porn film, I'm not sure, but the Amazon version is not very explicit.There's a supernatural sex theme as various people get their just desserts in interesting ways, the best being as Uschi Diggart is seduced by the bed-sheets she lies in.Very little makes sense, but I loved it for that alone.The next film ""Toys are not for Children"" is quite strange (not in any positive way). A girl is obsessed with her long-lost father and the toys she got from him.She grows up to an immature woman. A man marries her, but she can't satisfy him or herself as she wants to sleep with her toys. I thought that this was just stupid.Somehow she gets involved with an odd woman who sets her up with another man (who *spoiler alert* *spoiler alert* turns out to be her daddy whom she kills)!"
1,A very poor conference proceedings with too many junk papers,"Although PAKDD is not a well-reputed conference, it is not bad in the past. Some good papers can be found in the 1st and 2nd PAKDD. But I am very disapointed for the 3rd one. There are too many junk papers in it. Some paper just said some nonsense about a concept.I want to choose a 0 star for it, but it is not available in AMAZON's rating list."
4,Great Christmas Movie,"You can never go wrong with the Little House on the Prairie.However all the stories on this cd, can also be found in the box sets.It is however way easier to grab this cd to play at Christmas then to go through all the episodes in the box sets.Wonderful morals and great Family entertainment."
3,Nice Christmas Shows (3-1/2 stars),"These two Christmas episodes of LHP are best suited for fans of the TV series... though true fans will probably want to purchase the whole series on dvd. Both of these shows are 'good' 'nice' programming typical of the 1970's... (and like ""The Waltons"") are family-friendly and enjoyable for once a year holiday viewing."
2,Included on the Complete Season set!,"In a very unclear and probably intentionally confusing marketing move, both of these episodes are or will be available on the Complete Season box sets being released by the same company. This disc includes the Christmas episodes from Seasons 1 and 8. Season 1 is already available on DVD in a complete set, including this episode. Season 8 will be available in the near future. Unless you must have this Season 8 episode now, you are much better off to wait and buy the complete sets (a much better value)."
5,Little House on the Prairie Christmas DVD,"I had seen these episodes of Little House on the Prairie when they were first shown on TV. The quality of the DVD, including the sound and picture, was excellent. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to see a good, wholesome Christmas Story."
4,"Suprisingly Realistic, Diappointingly Short","This book was surprisingly realistic in the way the characters reacted. There were many points where I myself could relate and honestly say that ""I've been there and done that!""This is the story of a young boy, Andy, who enters junior high in the hopes that it will be his best year ever. He soon finds that it is possibly his worst year ever and he will soon find out where his loyalties lie.I thought that the book could have been longer, and more detailed. At times it felt like the author just wasn't giving enough details or information. Also at times it felt like you could tell it really was written by an adult,and although the author did a good job, I believe it is the hardest challenge for authors to portray teenagers in a story, especially in the given plot.Overall, 4 stars. Well written.Good for Readers in Junior High and up. (12+)"
2,Not great,Really a young adult book. Overly simple and predictable coming of age coming out story. Not badly written it just doesn't compare to so many others so much better. Perhaps if you are a teenager it would speak more to you than a mature adult.
3,Too many errors and no errata,"The book is decent - better than a few I have purchased but suffers from a common failing in technical books - it is repleat with errors. Really, a book which is used by some in technical schools or colleges should have only a few errors at most. This book has scores of errors, which makes learning very difficult. Like most subjects if you intend to teach yourself, you will need three or four references including PLC manuals in order to resolve the many ambiguous diagrams and statements in the text..."
2,Dry and probably outdated,"The book looks to be outdated in coverage of PLCs . The wording is very dry and technical with not many pictures explaining the concept . Book is in black and white -- I prefer color books like Petruzella's Programmable Logic Controllers . Had I know all this I probably would not have purchased this book . 2nd edition is also an old edition of the book which could explain why it is outdated . If you are starting out on PLC's , this book is not recommended . Go with Programmable Logic Controller by Petruzela ."
4,totally funky and jazzy. Only topped by his first album.,"This is a great album. Keziah Jones is totally funky and jazzy and groovy. Not just run of the mill but with his own style and thoughtful messages in his lyrics to go along with his absolutely amazing musical abilities. I gave this album four stars only because his first album ""Bluefunk"" (which Amazon doesn't list for some reason) is better."
1,I receive the wrong cover,the book is awesome but on the title say hardcover and i receive today a softcover book
4,Do you need this book?,"I bought this book for someone diagnosed and medically dependent. They were so confused by the rules of the Doctor on what to eat and not eat, this book cut through all the read tape for them."
1,Missing in action,"Ordered September 30, 2009. Still not delivered on November 1, 2009. Requested an address change, which seller said was too late. Request posted September 30; book shipped October 2. 2009."
4,Good Information,This book lists Vitamin K levels for so many foods. This book has helped me keep my coumadin levels at a consistent level. Before the book my levels were up and down. Good resource.
4,Female adventures both fun and frustrating,"This short story collection is chock-full of women's issues, from dealing with difficult friendships to finding Mr. Right to coping with PMS. The stories are a times predictable (ie, girl gets boy), at times frustrating (ie, girl keeps chasing wrong boy), but also are frequently heart-warming and always engaging. The biggest author included is Maeve Binchy, and her fans will recognize the characters of her story ""Carissima"" from several of her books. However, the lesser-known authors hold their own, and I plan to check out some of their novels as well, such as ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married"" by Marian Keyes. If you enjoy female fiction combined with Irish/British lit, you're likely to enjoy this book."
2,Half and Half,"I only enjoyed about 50% of the short stories in this book. But of those I did like, I really, really enjoyed them. I would just rather get an entire book from those authors that I liked than read a few short stories. Just as you get into the story, it's over. Although it was helpful in learning new authors."
5,Well worth reading,"This collection of stories has something for everyone.It will make you laugh and cry. I especially recommend the stories by Maeve Binchy, Tina Reilly, Annie Sparrow, Marisa Mackle and Mary Ryan. This book is brilliant value for money!"
4,My Review,"Just finished reading today.I loved it!! Well, some of the stories I liked, some were boring.My favourite has to be, ""The Unlovable Woman"" by Annie Sparrow.It's a short story about a woman who has just been stood up by whom she thought was Mr. Right. The next day at work a ""fortune teller"" of sorts tells her that love will come knocking on her door, and to be ready for it. I'm not going to ruin the story, but her true love has been right there in front of her for a long time, but she was too busy dating the ""rejects"" to notice ""mr. Right."""
3,A Fresh Start,"When Rowtina Washington's husband, Turtle, is killed in car accident she must learn to move on with her life without him. However, she finds it difficult to move on when her husbands spirit begins to come to her. With no one to turn, including a mother that is overly critical, she decides to join the Leave Him and Live Sisterhood club. Each of these women will play an important part of helping Rowtina to move on while helping themselves with their own personal dram.One Foot In Love is a novel about not letting your fears get in the way of living your life. Bill Wright takes you on a journey into the lives of a group of women trying to better themselves. This novel has a good combination of humor mixed with serious topics."
3,"Too small even on my slim face. However, great glasses in larger size.","I have a slim face and these were too small. Probably good for a teenager. However, these are built solid. Perfect tint and style. I ordered the mediums after I returned these and they are perfect."
5,"Beatiful music, perfect art","This CD is interesting to listen, and you can listen to this for years! :-) This is italian pop-music, singer is very well talented with a voice of a seiren :-)"
2,Just o-k,"This movie lacked plot. The acting was not up to par. Considering the decade it was made, the participants have come a VERY long way!!!!!But, don't waste your time on this unless you want to add it to your Afrocentric movie collection."
3,Hamlet's Greatest Hits,"This is not Shakespeare's Hamlet, but it was interesting and ultimately surprisingly engrossing. Huge portions of the play have been excised. Just enough of the story is left in to give you a hint of the plot. At times it seems to be ""Hamlet's greatest hits,"" rather than Hamlet. It's performed with some odd-ish camera effects and lighting, in modern dress, on an empty stage where the background is obscured and the only props or settings are those which can be carried on by the actors. The readings were interesting and the acting was mostly very good. I wouldn't recommend this as a first Hamlet. Nor should it be viewed by Shakespeare purists, who will hate it. If you are familiar with the play and can't get enough of this enigmatic Danish prince (for example, if you're the type who actually finds reading Hamlet criticism fun and recreational), it might give you some new insights into the play and into Hamlet's character. I enjoyed it."
4,GREAT OLD TV SHOW,"I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SHOW ON DVD,I WAS 13 YRS OLD WHEN THIS SHOW WAS ON TV.ITS GREAT TO SEE HOW THESE GREAT ACTORS OF TODAY GOT STARTED.WHAT EVER HAPPEND TO PAUL BURKE.THE PICTURE QUALITY IS FANTASTIC,ITS GREAT TO SEE A TV SHOW 51MINS LONG NOT 39 MINS TODAY.TV SETS ARE FANTASTIC TODAY BUT THE COMMERICALS ARE REDICULOUS,TODAYS TV STARS WORK MUCH LESS THEN THOSE OF YEARS AGO AN MAKE SO MUCH MORE MONEY.I HOPE IMAGE VIDEO COMES OUT WITH MORE OF THESE OLD TV SHOWS,MABEY M SQUAD MR LUCKY,THE DEFENDERS,GREAT JOB IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT."
1,Waste of money at any price,Don't bother with this unless you are really (and I mean REALLY) turned on by strippers.
4,Kidsongs - Good night,"When you need just a little time to clean house or just need to keep the kids entertained for a few. These kids can do it. They sing and dance to older music. These are some yrs old. You can get them at Wal-Mart for only a dollar, but they only carry a few different ones. So, if your kids get hooked on them you still have to come to amazon to get them. Eleswhere they are 12.00 and up a copy. If they had up to day music, I would say they may be worth the 12.00"
5,Perfectly Delightful Childs Night Time Video,"Good Night Sleep Tight is one of the finest and simplest videos ever made. It is a perfect occasional replacement for a bedtime story. My daughter, who is now 11, loved it and so does my son. I have recommended this video to others many times and even loaned them my copy; they loved the video too. My copy became lost so I truly wish that it would come back into print so that I can buy it again and show it to my neices and nephews."
2,Not as expected,I have bought many kidsong videos over the years. This particular video was not near as good. It did make me tired.
3,Comes with a map,"This is an above average field guide, but the writing is sometimes so dry that while reading you may feel as if you are hiking through death valley, not Mammoth or the Ritter Range. The map that comes with it is fantastic, although, it comes from the 1920's surveys of the area."
4,Evocative,This was very evocative of a time and a place. I liked the writing but I felt that it could have nearly been two books - one about the author's childhood and a second about the murders.
4,My childhood was the foreground to a murderer,"Pleasant languid recollection of growing up in WA. Dominated by Perth's parochialism, the family loyalty to Dunlop industries and a very tenuous link to a local serial killer. Evocative but ultimately as shallow as the culture that it describes."
1,BLANK DVD's,"Like another reviewer, my DVD's were blank--except for the producer's ads.. I'd really like to see the workouts, but do I risk getting another set of blanks, too."
2,She's Annoying,"Her voice is grinding and the work-out can challenge you, but is afraid of muscles and curves. I'm not letting my booty go and that makes me skip about 1/3rd of the DVD. If you enjoy a backside and a challenging gym workout, this probably isn't for you."
4,Great workout,I have been going to the Bar Method studio in San Francisco for about 2 years and love this form of exercise. These DVDs are great for adding to my workouts. Burr does a great job at explaining the details of each exercise and the only complaint that I have is that there are not many advanced options of the exercises. Hopefully more Bar Method DVDs will come out in the future!
4,So far so good,"I enjoy these exercise routines. No impact whatsoever, but you can feel it once you are done. Have lost 1/2 an inch in the first week."
4,Surprised - Very effective workout,"Very surprised as this workout was better than I thought it would be. I'm use to fast cardio and free weights, and decided to try something new. This workout actually reached muscles that have been ignored. Worth trying."
4,So far so good,"I am liking it so far. I do it twice a week and I am feeling the burn. I wish it was a little longer with more repetitions though. I hope she makes more videos, but will continue with these until I don't see results."
3,"Too much talk, not enough action","The bar method will make you sore, but I couldn't get past all of Burr's drawn out explanations. Also, I found the abdominal portion to be somewhat of a joke, and the beginning of the video takes forever to load (can't forward). If I did this 3 times a week I would probably see results, but the instruction and video just bug me too much."
5,Uplifting and slimming,"These two workouts will make changes to your body that you have probably never been able to achieve before! I am an avid exerciser and believe in changing up my routine on a regular basis as well as adding something new at least once a year...fools the body! Anyhow, these two routines are easy to follow, slow and deliberate in pace, and really pull in all those outer bulges! The tapes are long enough that it's a substantial workout. Great compliment to pilates, power yoga, and weight lifting. Definitely a worthwhile investment."
2,Not much of a workout...,"I love barre workouts, but this one did not do much for me challenging. I also bought super sculpt by Burr and love it."
5,Love it!,When looking at these videos you may think 'What? How can this be beneficial?'. I agree and it is the micro movements that kick my butt every time. I love how I only have to do it for a couple weeks and I feel leaner.
5,Simple and Elegant!,This server is worth more than the going price. It looks and feels very similar to the ones at the mall at 2X the price. The glass cover is not terribly heavy. It is simple and elegant at the same time. I recommend this to everyone.
2,"Nice Plate, but Beware of Shipping","After two attempts to have it shipped, I gave up and bought it in a local store. The plate is very nice, but having it arrive in 1000 pieces was not. The second shipment never even made it two our house - UPS said it was ""damaged"" and sent it back automatically. If they can't ship it, they shouldn't sell it."
1,Broken,It arrived broken - shattered in many pieces. Poor packing. It was a Christmas gift. I would love to have had it to give but will not reorder. There is no guarantee that the next one would arrive in better shape. The original package (not the packing box) did not protect the product in shipment.
1,Horrible packaging,"I can't review the product its self because it arrive in a 1000 little pieces. I sent as a christmas gift, which did arrive in time, but the glass dome was at the bottom of a cardboard box with some packing peanuts. My friend contacted customer service and they acknowledged a problem with packaging and sent a replacement, still doesn't make up for a broken christmas gift. Out of the 22 items I've ordered for christmas it was the only one to arrive in less than expected condition. I'll review the actual product when she gets an intact piece."
4,Cake Plate,"Based on the item description, I was under the impression that the little pedestal/dip cup was a separate piece from the plate and dome. It's actually attached to the plate. I was a little taken aback because it would be easier to store cake in the fridge or transport it to someone else's house without the pedestal, but it's not a huge deal. Also, my dome had a few imperfections. Not bad enough to exchange it for another, but you can tell it's not a really expensive piece. Regardless, I'm fairly pleased with this item and like that it has more than one use! I'm looking forward to storing cakes, cookies and other baked goods in it."
4,"Slight imperfections in the glass, but a very nice cake server","After reading some of the other reviews on this product, I almost didn't order it as I'm pretty picky and was concerned about the comments on the quality of the glass. Had I not read the reviews, I would not have even noticed the slight imperfections in the glass, but yes, when I look, I can see some waviness and a small line on the top nob where the mold pressed into the glass. This set is made in Italy, not in China, and I imagine craftsmen and women creating this set by hand and thus the slight imperfections. But I think it's a nice set and despite Amazon's very liberal return policy, I will keep it.One star off for the fact that the glass isn't perfect, but again it's a nice set at a great price."
4,Good for the price - depending on where you purchase it!,"I purchased this from one of the ""big box"" stores locally at a price competitive with this. It is OK for the dollars. I saw some more expensive and prettier ones, but I have kids and the chances that this will get broken are high - so this is enough to spend. This will cover a pretty tall cake and it is real good for keeping bagles fresher longer, though it only holds a few if they are large ones. For the cost I might buy a second one as I am sure I will use it. Better than having a plastic cake holder sitting on your counter.Anyway....I saw the same item on a department store site for $50.00! It is the same thing! Save your money, this is a good price and fair for the quality."
1,Never got to use it...,"It arrived with the base broken to bits. I returned it, but asked for a refund. The way it was packed (by mfg), it's a miracle not everyone's arrives broken. I really needed it for a party, so was pretty disappointed. I've ordered from Amazon for years and never had this happen. I'm bummed."
2,Can't get a response,"I ordered this at the beginning of June and got an email asking if I wanted to contact the seller since I was refunded my money. I got no explanation why it was refunded. When I contacted the seller I never got an answer. I reordered but am skeptical since the other one is still showing ""not yet shipped"". I hope I get a response before they go and run it through again. I asked them to cancel the first one but with no response. Very frustrating!Luigi Bormioli Gallerie 4-in-1 Covered Plate with Dome"
3,$17.99 for 3-in-1,"This is a good price for a cake dome but it is really a serving tray. The anchor hocking ones that cost a few dollars more have a problem with the punch bowl but the Bormioli design does not have that problem. A review on another site advises that the dome is too shallow for cakes. I have a large plastic dome that is big enough for cakes but I need this one for small cakes to be served with tea. I like having covers over food and I prefer covers to be transparent. I am getting this instead of Jamie Oliver's 2 tier party plate that costs $30 or the smallish Lenox Butterfly sandwich tray that also costs $30.I don't like to buy glass cake dome sets like this because storage is a hassle but I need this for company and this is cheaper. If I lived in the Swiss Alps with two goats, I wouldn't need this, of course."
2,Warning: do not use for warm items!,"I've had this cake plate for about 1 year now, and have only used it a few times but tonight I pulled it out and put a warm pineapple upside-down cake on the plate, and after it sat for about 5 minutes, we heard POP! and a chunk of glass about 3"" wide broke off of the plate. I could understand a thermal crack if the plate was cold, but it was straight out of the closet and the cake had cooled for quite a while before we moved it onto the cake plate. Very sad that I have to throw it out, and we didn't get any dessert tonight!"
1,"Save your money, don't buy this!","I was so excited to see that Amazon was carrying this item and at the price of $29.99 as Macy's sold the very same thing for $50.00! (Because Macy's carried it, I made the assumption that it would be of good quality. Wrong!!!) I was really excited about its multi-use. It looked lovely in the pictures and therein lies the problem. First of all, it's not nearly as beautiful in person as in the pictures. Rather than graceful with elegant lines, it is chunky and plain. Second of all, the quality of glass is very, very cheap. The dome, plate, and base were full of very distracting bubbles. There were even lines in the glass where lines should not have been. I was so disappointed in this item that I promptly returned it! Don't waste your time or money."
1,"It was great, until it broke.....","I used this product 1 1/2 times. The first time it stored my baked goods (which were consumed within a day) just fine. The second time I used it, i put a piece of baked bread in. I was in my living room tending to my child and heard a noise in the kitchen.... The dome broke in half rightdown the middle of flat base.I went on their website to see if they offer any support and all you get is the option to send them an e-mail....."
4,"fine product, but be prepared to have it shipped twice!","the plate and dome are nice. the problem is this dish is all glass and the packaging is awful. there are several other reviews that touch on this point, but no one seems to be addressing the problem. that said, amazon is great with sending another dish if you receive a box full of broken glass."
3,Packaging is not very good.,"Packaging is not very good. Had to have it resent to me due to broken glass. The second one turned out fine, but again due to the same packaging I feel I got lucky that it didn't break during transit."
5,Love it!,If you are using valuable storage space make sure you use it for something that fills a couple of purposes! This is it!
2,Poorly packaged!,"This is a beautiful set, however, when I pulled the plate out of the box, the bottom lip cracked. It is packaged very poorly, so be careful. The manufacturer needs a better packaging design. Also, the lid does not sit well on the plate, which leaves room for gaps. I put a fruit cake on display, and fruit flies got through the gaps. Air can also escape, which leaves cakes dry."
1,broken,"this a beautiful product, but to my disappointment before I even oopen the box I could tell it was shatter just by holding the box and moving it a little. This is better to buy at a store."
5,Very pretty! A little sexy too!,"I got this in teal/blue fog.So pretty!My husband loved it lol.Not TOO sexy, just a little.Great fit, very true to size.Comfy and light weight too.I'm back for another!"
1,Defective DVDs,"The DVD I received was defective. I returned it but the replacement DVD was also defective. The people who made them should address quality control. Also, they should not be able to give their own DVD 5 stars. How tacky can you get?"
1,Another modern classic chopped up in stupid standard screen!,"Thank goodness Dick Van Dyke's brilliant Never A Dull Moment recently got the classy widescreen treatment it so richly deserved, but Divorce American Style? Nope! They threw it into the crummy standard screen bin, like it was a piece of trash!I mean it only starred Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds,was directed by Bud Yorkin, with Conrad Hall as the Director of Photography. So I guess the studio (Columbia/Tristar) just didn't think these people were GOOD enough to deserve a widescreen release!I will gladly buy this DVD, because the theatrical version was GREAT, but only IF it ever comes out in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Continue to boycott all standard screen butcher jobs, everyone!"
1,AVOID FULL FRAME BUTCHER JOB,"yet again...a studio ""dumbs down"" a release by not giving us the full image. Teach them a lesson by boycotting these ""butchered"" releases...Conrad Hall (the cinematographer) deserves better."
5,Can Arguing Be Hilarious ?,"Just saw this GREAT movie over holidays --came out originally in 1967.I don't know how to explain that arguing could ever be therepeutic but somehow the WAY this movie is done, makes you realize how inane the topics of disagreement are, how ridiculous --how common divorce is and how it is a plight of America and the times in some ways so you really leave it having a much lighter outlook and I found the 60s themes actually ironically hilarious !You leave not feeling depressed and sorrowful but with a new outlook and understanding of the situation --and exactly how and why it happens --so often. With a refreshing recollection or preview of the appliances and gadgets of the 60s that makes you stifle a laugh more than once and laugh out loud at how ridiculous the topics of that era were and how slanted and sexist often.VERY WELL DONE Oldie in my opinion --highly recommend"
2,I Was Really Dissapointed,"Almost all of us has heard fo Taste of Home, and know of it's good reputation. So I couldn't help but be dissapointed when I looked at the recipes in this book. I only found a couple that I think I might try. :o("
5,Timely & in Perfect Condition,The Table Talk of Martin Luther arrived more quickly than I'd anticipated and was in perfect condition. Thank you. I would order from this distributor again.
2,Why Did This Book Win a Bram Stoker Award?,"COVENANT is a dull tale of demonic possession and human sacrifice, where the reader must plod through almost a hundred pages before anything slightly interesting occurs.The story revolves around an unlikable former Chicago reporter named Joe Kieran and his investigation into a small seaside town's long history of seasonal suicides. Instead of building any sort of strong narrative, author John Everson chooses to burden readers with Kieran's horny daydreams and creepy thoughts for a girl barely out of high school, or overload us with the graphic details for raunchy roadside sex and a teenaged girl's masturbation fantasies. Rather than being truly a horror novel, COVENANT reads more like a lame thriller bordering on cheesy porn lit. I don't know how this book deserved a Bram Stoker award."
4,Great first book,A fine horror novel with a lot of twists and turns along the way. Good strong character development. If you are a horror fan you will enjoy this one.
3,Over the Top,"When I started this book, I was interested in where it was going, I liked the main character, I enjoyed meeting the secondary characters and their stories. I was entertained by the experiences and the attitude with which the book was written and some scenes while a bit 'over the top' fit in well with the book. The demon was a bit obnoxious for my taste, but when I mentioned this to someone I loaned the book to, she responded with, ""He's a demon."" She had a point, there aren't very many 'nice' demons out there...lol. The reason I gave this book three stars, is because some readers might actually enjoy this book...and the obnoxious demon. It was well written, the story had depth, the scenes were easy to visualize and it contained several suspenseful moments."
2,This is NOT a good book.,"I can't believe this book won the Bram Stoker Award. I was very dissapointed in this book. The only reason I finished the book was because I figured it had to get better since it was a Stoker Award winner. Wrong. This book is considered horror but I did not find any part of the book scary. Also, the sex/rape scenes were ridiculous. Clearly the author was writng out some teenage fanatsy but that does make for good literature. Save your time and money."
2,TAKE NO PRISONERS HOME !,"This compilation is a combination of two vinyl releases. Both albums (PRISONER and TAKE ME HOME) come directly from the vaults of the disco era in the late 1970s. CHER did achieve a top 5 DISCO hit with the a Maxi 12"" inch version of the single ""TAKE ME HOME"". You will also be able to audition the single released from PRISONER. That title track never managed to chart. As her fan base dropped in the late 1970s, Cher began to paint herself as a ""ROCK ARTIST"" supplying lead vocals to the one album band ""BLACK ROSE"". Unfortunately, this cd is filled with weak material. It would be a better option for consumers to purchase the cd ""BILLBOARD's TOP DISCO 1978"". On that compilation you find the CHER single TAKE ME HOME plus various others artists."
3,A great listen,I think that this Cher album is just great. It captures what Cher is really about. The songs are just great and Cher shows how she can really belt out really good songs.
1,"Just terrible, and not in a good way.","God, from the first minute I could tell this was going to be a crap movie. I nearly turned it off within 5 minutes. I wish I had. It looks like it was shot on video. There's no use of depth of field or filters of any sort. The lighting is harsh and generally poor. It looks like a made-for-daytime-soaps production. Seriously, it looks like something off Days of Our Lives or one of those other low-production-value shows. The acting is terrible, and about on par with daytime soaps.Avoid this movie at all cost. It's certainly not worth the MSRP of $30. Hardly worth the $5 I bought it for. Yeah, it's that bad. Just terrible."
4,Very Different,Obviously very low budget which I suspect is why a lot of other reviewers did not like it. I was wary at first but it is so unique that I got interested. It is very gruesome and gory and pretty creepy. Much more than I would have expected. The fact that it is in Italy and all the actors are Italian make it unique also. I bought it in a 10 dollar movie pack with 5 other movies and I think it will be the best one. I dont think I will regret the purchase. Not a waste of time unless you cant handle low budget.
3,level 1 does not work,"I like this DVD because it has tons of animals, however one thing I bought it for was because supposedly it has a ""grow with me"" feature, meaning that when the baby is old enough they show and say the name of the animal, however no matter if I choose level 1 or 2, the dvd shows the word and says the animal's name, so there is no level 1! My son is 17 months old so it does not matter because we would not use the level 1 anyway. Another thing I did not like was that they are very specific about saying the name of the animal like: clown fish, I would prefer if they just said: ""fish"" and then they say: ""snow monkeys"" again I would have liked if they just said: monkeys."
3,"OK, but not great","Our 18-month old has loved the World Music video for most of her life, so we were eager to get this one. However, she just doesn't enjoy this one as much. She doesn't really laugh at the puppet shows on this one--they don't really make sense. It just doesn't seem to display the level of thought and effort that the other video did.She does watch this video, but it rarely keeps her interest all the way through the way World Music still does."
2,Huh?,"Well, I guess the only good thing I can say about these guys is that they can apparently fool the masses. Seriously, how can anyone respond to such shallow and disgusting dreck with such adulation? BLECH! Yes, I know, none of you will like this review. Boo hoo."
4,This CD is really poppy but very cool...,"If you like pop music, this is your stuff. It's a very predictable sound but they manage to pull it off quite nicely. It even has a track written by Sheryl Crow and it's very cool."
1,malefic and raising hell,"If your a fan of ""B"" movies you've got yourself a winner. Raising hell embraces the epiotome of ""BAD"""
5,Eco-Biblical Interpretation Resource!,"As a seminary student interested in biblical studies and eco-theology, the ""Earth Bible"" series has been a great resource in my writing. Volume 4's collection of articles was particularly helpful to understand overlooked moments of the land/earth's ""voice"" in prophetic visions or the agency of nonhuman creation in the Psalms. One article re-reading Jeremiah 4 and the possible interpretation of the earth's personification was a refreshing reading of the lamenting prophet.The range of articles in this volume refocuses biblical studies away from an andro-centric reading of texts that may reveal something new about the Divine if we in the Western Christian perspective reflected more seriously on the non-human portions of creation. This series is strongly recommended for the aspiring academic, the established academic, and the educated non-academics interested in Christianity and environmental ethics."
2,Look At Lovecraft From One of His Closest Friends,"A look at the life and times of Howard Phillips Lovecraft by Frank Bellknap Long, one of his closest friends and fellow writer. Long discusses his meetings with Lovecraft, Lovecraft's marriage, his homage to Poe and Dunsany, and his ideas about literature as well as his unwavering atheistic materialist philosophy. Long obviously is suffering from hero-worship to a great degree here and is not very objective, but it is still worth reading for anyone interested in macabre literature."
4,Tiedown Works Great,"Does exactly what it says in the advertisement, make your tie stay put and professional. This was my second purchase of tiedowns."
5,I love this product.,This product is amazing. I'm not too great with ties although I have a slight obsession with them. This makes wear a tie so much less of a hassle. No adjusting all day long. It makes my days much easier love it.
4,So cute!,"I bought this for my 8-year-old daughter who wants to be a pumpkin for Halloween. It's supposed to be for an adult, but we wanted something we could stuff for fullness and that would partially cover her legs (we didn't want something skimpy). I followed the reviewer's advice who said to slip a headband into the ""hat"" to keep it on better, and that was great advice - works very well - otherwise it would just slip off her head. We'll also velcro the back to keep it closed better (it only has ties at the top of the long slit up the back). The vines and leaves are cute and attached well, the fabric is thin but warm (usually it's cold here on Halloween), it seems fairly durable, and I got a good price. I gave it 4 stars because it would be nice not to have to alter it at all (headband, stuffing, velcro, bottom swatch of cloth between the legs), but overall it's working out well. My daughter is VERY happy with it and she looks adorable in the happy jack-o-lantern!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with the costume I purchased. The item had good reviews online, and when it arrived it looked like it was used. The costume has spots all over it, and cannot be cleaned. I'm even more disappointed that I will not be able to wear the costume for my party tomorrow night. I don't understand why someone would ship something in such bad condition. Anyone that intends to buy this, needs to be aware of what condition it might arrive in."
5,Very cute costume!,"This costume is very cute! It fits well. I received my costume in excellent condition, very quickly."
2,Pumpkin Pie,The material is a little too flimsy for my taste. You would difineately have to wear something under it in chilly temps.
2,"Good intent, but hidden affirmations!","I've bought and listened to many of Eldon Taylor's subliminal tapes, including this one, and only after having read two of his books did I learn of the hidden list of messages that are included in all of his programs. ""Mommy and I are one"", and ""It's OK to do better than Daddy"" are supposed to offer a ""oneness fantasy"" for the listener. Once I learned of these and other hidden affirmations I decided not to listen again and have thrown out my collection of Dr. Taylor's tapes."
1,This is NOT Leguizamo's Freak.,"Although, I did a thorough search for a dvd by john leguizamo called ""The Freak"", Amazons search engine lead me to this page. It even offered a commbined purchase with margaret cho/ another great stand up comic. HOWEVER. this is NOT Leguizamos Freak. So put a sigh aside and keep searching, it's bound to turn up somewhere in the near future, either in a clearance bin or on an overpriced cult list, along with ""Spic-O-Rama"". In any case. it's not here. John should really consider distributing these two stand up shows. Both shows are currently owned by HBO, sitting on a shelf collecting somebodies dust bunnies."
1,utter trash!!!,"stupid me for reading the covers. should have known that being released by shock-o-rama that this movie would be a complete piece of junk. terrible movie about a guy escaping from a van thats escorting him to another mental institution. the guy is all bandaged up but they never even show his face like they do on the cover, go figure! anyways the guy kills like one or two people, not even good deaths, in fact i don't think they really show him killing anybody if i remember right. no thrills, chills, or scares to be had. just a waste of time! the people that gave this movie good reviews had to have helped make the film, sorry but theres no other explanation, just terrible."
4,"Works great, as long as you're careful","I like this shredder because it is compact and shreds finely. However, because of its small size you do need to be careful with it. After shredding a few items, the paper level in the bin becomes too high for the paper to drop down nicely so it stays and gets stuck in the the shredding mechanism. As long as I'm attentive about emptying it routinely it's no problem."
3,Shreds but Doesn't Sharpen,"The price was right for this item. I paid $33 for this shredder, and I specifically wanted one with a pencil sharpener. I shreds well enough but unless I rotate the pencil and position it the sharpener doesn't work."
1,This product is junk!,The minute it arrived it didn't work right. What a waste of money! Don't bother buying it!!If I could give it negative stars I would. One star only because I had to choose a star to rate it.
3,Battery Pack,"The fit and worked as advertised. This is not an negative review, it is just saying I got what I paid a fair price for. Evaluation comes with use, so far they work fine..........but it could be months before battery problems come up, so it really isn't fair to the seller or the buyer to expect a realistic review.So far so good......a fair price for a product that works."
4,Quite funny actually,"It's amazing actually how much truth these books have in them.They are written very tongue-in-cheek. Quite humorous, and clearly exaggerating conditions back then, but you can see many of the points actually in the present.Amusing read, with lots of action. Clear-cut heros and villains (if you're looking for a twist on who the good guy or bad guys is, this isn't your book). But, definitely get to see the world from two vantage points, and a clear descriptive account of how things are from these very different pair of eyes.Story is building up quickly at this point."
5,Excellent primer for those interested in Science/Chemistry,"This book brings the elements of the periodic table into focus as a part of everyday life. It explains their uses, properties, interesting facts, and origins. Inorganic chemistry is explained plainly and in extremely understandable terms. I found the book to be especially useful for young people in middle and high school starting chemistry studies or who are having difficulties with the subject."
4,Good but old.,The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because the information is a bit old and some of it is so out of date it is now wrong.
4,Hints for 15mm application,"There is a real trick to getting this band DOWN to the 15mm attach-width: You must take a needle-nosed pliers (or similar tool) and PULL OUT the spring-loaded spacers at the ends. Once they're gone, the remaining mounting loop is, indeed, 15mm.""Long length"" is rather relative -- we needed to add three more links to this already longer-than-typical band. Our local jeweler only charged $3 for the matching links and the work. (BTW, our local Walmart jewelry counter would NOT work on it, since neither the band nor the watch were purchased there. Logical, I suppose, but not exactly endearing.)"
3,"Good book for pilots looking for ""something else"" to read ...","I recommend this book for people who are already pilots, and would like to pick up some text that help them keep their skills up and their head out of the sand. A couple of years after finishing my primary training, I was looking for something that was more ""advanced"" than my training manuals yet something that will keep me thinking about the issues and dangers.The book is organized by phases of flight- I find myself thumbing through the preflight section often. But the style of the authors to present their work in essays written individually feels a bit disconnected at times.- Neeraj"
5,Excellent Watch,"I have been planning to buy this watch for a while now and finally my wife got it for me 3 weeks back from a Movado store. I must say that as much as I am thankful to my wife to buy it for me, I just admire wearing this watch. I gives a boost of confidence when I wear it to my office.It is not too ""bling-bling"" but definitely a eye catcher and goes with almost any attire. Just love it."
3,It's Alright,This video is alright for beginners. I'm an intermediate exerciser and dancer. I thought this would be a great cross-training tool but I felt like it was a little too lax for my tastes. It'd be a great toning video for beginners or those who need a really low impact workout (ie. injuries).
2,Kinda boring,Not much to brag about 'cos everything was telegraphed by amateur storytelling. Just a lacksidaisical slasher flick made on a home movie budget. Some of the girls are pretty enough. The actors seem to hit their marks and speak their lines; there's no real emotional interest coming from the screen and there won't be any coming from the audience either. Passable way to waste a rainy afternoon. I got it as soon as it came out because it was from 1-Shot and they usually do better than this.
1,Holy crap!,"The words do not exist to describe the awfulness of this drek. I borrowed a copy from my friend, who told me it was a horrific movie, and he didn't disappoint. This is one of those great party movies where you all gather 'round and hurl insults at the DVD and have a grand old time. So, I guess that's one redeeming factor. Acting is amateurish, staging is puerile, and direction is non-existent. Do yourself a favor and buy a CITIZEN KANE -- to send to the filmmakers."
4,Not very realistic but definitely cuddly!,"I ordered this tiger for my daughter's fourth birthday. She had wanted one for a while because her older sister has a similar tiger. I had hoped it would be a little more realistic looking in the face; the photo is somewhat misleading. However, my daughter loves it. It is very soft & cuddly and a good value for the price. The shipping was pricey in comparison to the cost of the plush and it took several days to arrive; be prepared for a wait if you order this. Overall, very pleased with the product."
5,"Cuddly, lovable, adorable tiger!!!!",This is the most adorable stuffed tiger! All ages will adore from a small child to a grown adult collector!! Well worth the money!!
3,New Age Tolerence,"The author of this book appears to accept all kinds of paranormal beliefs and covers them all under the umbrella of astrology. There is not much Bible Study in it. Some Biblical verses are thrown it, but no detailed explaination is given on their meanings."
3,"A very strong series, but why only the 1st 4 of 5 seasons?","I'm a fan of 'Babylon 5', but buying a set that contains the first 4 seasons, andnot the final 5th season seems odd indeed.Unless at a given moment the price for this plus buying the 5th season separately is a better deal,I'd urge you to buy the whole set, 5th season included. Would you buy a terrific novel withthe last 50 pages missing?"
1,Not Even Good By B Standards,"I decided since it was on tv that I would check out Pinata: Survival Island. What a mistake that was. The first 2 mins I realized this way far from an actual movie and decided to switch into my B movie mode. I figured I could get a few laughs out of it but was wrong. It wasn't so bad that it's funny, it's just so bad period. Jamie Presley definately didn't do herself any favors taking this role. I might scratch it off the resume.I would pass on Pinata: Survival Island if you have the opportunity."
1,boring schlock,What a waste. Glad I only rented it!The gusy from Buffy & Voyager are in it and still that doesn't even save it. What were their agents thinking?
2,Pinata: Survival Island,"It could have been a lot better if more realistic. The pinata should have been a real monster rather than an animated ""thing"". Otherwise the movie was OK."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad",This movie was awful! I would rather watch the grass grow. The special effects were substandard and the actors were bad!
3,"Not Great, but there is many that are far worse","Have to Give this credit on a couple things: It has some good gore/blood in it, some interesting kills! As others mentioned, a bit comical at times. Really good picture and sound quality. Being a survivor fan, the island / competition between teams kind off interested me about this film. Its worth a watch, But I must say, it is a bit generic, and as said before, no one is winning any awards for their acting in this one. This is the kind monster that I would laugh at not be scared of! Final verdict not bad/ not good, but definitely worth seeing- rent first! Then if you like it buy it."
2,Low Budget Horror Film,"Hunky boys and cute sexy girls are running around an island being chased by a pinata monster. The actors and actresses appear to be college-age and most likely had a good time making the movie. Actually, the acting is not bad, and if you believe in monsters the story is believable. Enjoy!"
1,MAY be the WORST movie EVER...,"Why in the name of all that is Holy and sacred in the world of Horror would anyone try to make a movie about a killer pinata? This movie was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo unbelievably dumb!!!! I saw it on AMC one night and couldn't believe it wasn't a made for the Sci-Fi channel movie! The special effects were INCREDIBLY bad, the acting was terrible, the death scenes were way too expected, and the ending was so obvious from the start. This movie is beyond help. A total waste of time. I am only writing this review to try and shake some sense into people dumb enough to actually dish out money to buy this lame excuse for a movie. Come on, If you are going to spend money on a movie about a computer generated pinata than you need a little help. BAD movie...Shame on you people who thought up this pitiful creation."
2,Yuck,"I'm a horror fan, and I hated this.Nicholas Brendon, and Jaimie Pressley with a tropical setting and a monster. How it's possible to blow that for a horror fan is hard to describe, but this did.Please horror fans, look else where for gore entertainment."
2,"Wow, now even May Day has a slasher film to go with it...","Maybe I've seen one too many horror films, but this movie was extremely predictable. Within the first 10 minutes I had already picked out who was going to live until the end and who was not. Everything about this movie I had seen somewhere else. There's the token black character, the broken up couple who gets back together midway through the film, the pot smoking teens who unleash the beast and get killed shortly after, distorted shots from the killer's perspective... the list goes on. The CGI on the pinata was terrible, and the acting was mediocre at best. I wouldn't reccomend watching this movie; you can find everything you're looking for in plenty of other films...well, except for a demon pinata."
1,Pinata: Survival Island - one of the best bad movies!,"This is really a terrible movie, but my son and his friends enjoy watching awful sci-fi movies, so I got it for them. I think it's hilariously horrible, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh out loud!How many movies can they make about college kids on an island, being chased and mutilated by monsters and goblins?! PLEASE be sure that you get separated from the group, so that the monster can single you out and kill you!Haven't we all seen enough of these that we might actually believe the girl who has the initial encounter when she comes back totally terrified and tells us what happened? At least check it out!! THEN GET THE HECK OFF THE ISLAND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!!!"
2,THERE ARE ONLY 2 REASONS TO WATCH THIS THING AND ONE OF THEM ONLY LASTS UNTIL JAMIE PRESSLEY PUTS SOME CLOTHES ON!,"Miss Pressley has a body that many porn stars would envy and she's displayed it a few times in movies and in Playboy, but once she arrives on the island and covers up her thong bikini, that's really it for this movie... unless you sadistically like seeing actors you know trapped in a god-awful plot that's funnier on an unitentional level far more often is intended. One supposes that a ""Killer-pinata"" movie was intended as a spoof, but the tone is really unsure. Garret Wang from ""Star Trek: Voyager, "" and the guy who played Zander on ""Buffy,"" are the best known actors after Pressley. And apparently, they all need new agents."
4,Fitting conclusion,"The book is true to the two predecessors. Far fetched as all of Burroughs' creations, it weaves an exciting tale. True to all his work, Burroughs never kills off a hero, so there is not much suspense, but how they principles get to safety is a good ride for the reader. Most interesting is the concept of progressive evolution in a lifetime. What an idea! There are theological implications and a bit of philosophy. Puzzling is the obliviousness of the hero to romantic feelings. But that is another tendency of Burroughs' heroes. A fun story that concludes the trilogy."
3,"3rd book in Burrough's ""Caspak"" trilogy","Haven't read this in the Kindle version [which is why it only gets a ""safe"" rating of 3 stars], but thought anyone just cruising the listings of free Kindle editions who was unfamiliar with E.R.B's work might want to know that this is the 3rd book in a series: 1st - The Land that Time Forgot, 2nd - People that Time Forgot, 3rd - Out of Time's Abyss. Frankly, of the three I like this the best, but that's because the 1st two are largely just laying groundwork for this one. One thing, the books explain how Caspak exists apart from the rest of the world much better than has ever been portrayed in any of the [horrifically low-budget] movies derived from the novels over the years. Read'em all, they're fun!"
5,A fun read,"This book, Hollywood Hoofbeats, was a present for my cousin who loves horses and movies. I am a classic film watcher and this book was fun and educational. I would like to see this book updated to include the latest years as well."
5,G. DiPego,"Petrine Day Mitchum's book is more than exciting and informative. It's a tribute to all those horses who carried all those actors, and sometimes even carried the movies, too. They are the heroes of this book, and she presents them as individuals of courage and intelligence who so often suffered to bring us our thrills, from Ben Hur's chariot race to John Wayne jumping his mount over a fence and waving his hat in farewell. So many of our top movie memories include these animals. It's time they received the attention and respect - and the thanks - that they deserve. Gerald DiPego, Santa Ynez, California"
5,The horse in pop culture. Equine stars in movies and TV,"This is an excellent book on horses in pop culture. Well written, lots of great pics. From Muyrbridge's first equine moving images of the horse (1879), to The Lord of the Rings, the equine stars of almost every major (and lots of minor) horse movies are profiled.Not just the horses, the stunt doubles and wrangler are profiled here as well. Stories about the wranglers and hollywood horse suppliers abound.The section on the rise of Humane treatment of horses in movies is very interesting. Esepcially the role of Errol Flynn, who led the humane crusade after witnessing the destruction of horses injured in the filming of a scene.Great present for your horse loving friends."
5,Great Book for Western Fans,"If you have watched as many westerns as I have and wondered about the horses, you will enjoy this book. Lots of information on movies, the actors, and their equine partners. Makes a nice coffee table book and a definite must for the western movie horse buff. Petrine Mitchum included lots of information and first-hand knowledge from her years around Hollywood as Robert Mitchum's daughter as well as interviews with actor, horse trainers, wranglers, and stunt men. This book probably answers many questions about the horses you saw in westerns over the years. Would make a nice gift for the western movie/horse enthusiast. Lots of photos."
3,"marginal image quality, but inexpensive","Opteka lenses are a low cost alternative to the Canon brand conversion lenses.However, the image quality is not very good, and will only be acceptable on smaller size images.The lens is a big chunk of glass and blocks nearly all of the view through the viewfinder, so you will need to use the LCD for framing purposes.You will need to set your lens at the telephoto maximum, making it a fixed focal length lens (no zooming).It comes with an aluminum adaptor, which normally costs about $15 on its own.It's probably worth $30 if you are not too particular about image quality and are not making fine art shots."
3,Has vignetting problem at wider views,"I read the reviews before purchasing this lens so I was aware of the vignetting issue. In short, for the first about 2/3 of your zoom, your view is as if you are looking through a cardboard tube. You only have a picture in a circular region in the center of the picture. I found this to be acceptable though since I wanted this to bring me a lot closer to my subject. Most of the time when I am using this lens, I have it at the full zoom position where vignetting is not a problem."
2,"OK, but Sub-Par Quality","If you need that extra zoom, for the price, this lens isn't too bad. But, if like me you care about image quality and clarity, then be warned that I saw a significant downgrade in quality at all focal lengths.Overall, if the price weren't so low, I'd probably have said this was not worth a purchase, but since it's reasonable, it might be worth a purchase."
1,I was expecting something better!!,"I Thought this Lens would be better, but actually its too big, and de lens adapter doesnt fit as it should.I wouldnt buy another Opteka Lens."
1,This is not what you think...,"This is not the band which features Riggs from Rob Zombie, Mike Tempesta of Powerman 5000 and others. Scum of the Earth's CD entitled ""Blah...blah...blah..."" (Eclipse Records) is available on 10-26-2004 and Amazon will be carrying it as will all other finr retailers."
4,Good Basic Clear Pool Care Video with a few issues,"I am a swimming pool professional in both service, repair & construction. We purchased this video to give to our new pool customers. Most of it is very good and easy to understand. They suggest acid washing a pool after a few years. My experience would suggest this is a bad idea, as it shortens the life of the pool plaster."
3,"Good value for some, limited for others","This 25 minute video has good production quality. There is good information for a new pool owner, but little about spas. This video does not talk about vinyl liner pools, which is what I have. Nor does it talk about above ground pools, which I don't have. There was no talk of algae problems, how to test the water chemistry, seasonal opening and closing of pools. All in all, I doubt I will watch it again. I will probably donate it to my local library."
1,Wasted Time and Money,"When I read a 4 star review of this ""film,"" which is really a video of such poor quality, I could have shot it in high school, I figured, ""Why not?"" I'm always looking for a decent movie with some lesbian subject matter. There's so little quality material out there, most of which I've seen umpteen times, that I'm willing to give almost anything a shot. So, I gave MUMMY'S KISS a try, and it nearly gave me an aneurism. It was so stunningly awful, I wanted to cry. It's not even on par with the soft core blither they show on CINEMAX. The only good thing about MUMMY'S KISS is that it was short, very short, mercifully so. I wish I could give it no stars and return to a time when I'd never seen it. If you're looking for a fresh, funny and satisfying lesbian-themed flick that's well worth it? SAVING FACE."
2,mediocre,needed male presence in film. Too much acting. Needed main actress in it more . But was good if you don't want to see much.
2,"FLATTERING TO ""SCREAM""","If ""Sream"" had never been made, then this would have been an original worth going to the movies to see. But since ""Scream"" 1,2,&3 were made, that relegates this carbon copy made with half the budget and no name brand actors to sraight to DVD. I have seen worse. It was worth viewing for the first time this year. It will probably be antother year before I view it again, unless ""Scream 4"" comes out bbefore then. This cheaper ""Scream"" is two levels below the original in all aspects. You will not be bored. You may be annoyed by Ms Valley Girl. I do not think I have ever rooted for a killer so much. Much to my dismay she survived for a sequel. For that reason alone, I did not give this movie three stars. If you can get the original, watch ""Scream"". If you cannot get ""CUTTHROAT""."
2,Not Impressed,"Even for a B-horror movie, there is little to like about this film. The actors are mediocre, the characters are annoying, the killer isn't scary at all, not much blood, lame kill scenes, and the reveal at the end is lame. I have seen worse, so i went with 2 stars, but this one isn't really worth it to even dedicated horror fans like myself. I just had a hard time finding anything in this movie to get excited about."
1,piece of CRAP!,"This piece of crap is a disgrace to the slasher genre the acting is horrific and so is the plot.It tried to copy the scream movies but failed, it had only 2 kill scenes which i can remember it was really boring and just plain stupid.Do not order this piece of garbage."
3,Not a Bad Time-Killer,"""Cut Throat"" is yet another modern day slasher film. But it's at least better than many others that have come down the pike in recent years. The plot involves the cast and crew of a low budget slasher flick(could it be this one???) getting bumped off by someone dressed as the killer of said film.While it offers nothing in the way of originality, ""Cut Throat"" does have some decent production values as well as some inspired performances from the unknown cast. The identity of the killer actually came as a surprise to me, and I've been watching these films for many a year.Alas, the DVD has no extra features(or even a chapter selection) aside from a few trailers for other low budget horror movies. Ther are better slasher flicks out there, but one could do a lot worse than ""Cut Throat""."
3,My best firends sister,I have plot spoiler in here so if you don't want to know about the original idea in this film then move on now. My best friends sister is the annoying valley girl who won't die. I recommend this film just for the fact that she is the one person you expect to die who turns out to to be unstoppable. What a great and original idea which turns those other slasher flicks on their heads.
3,Red Sox pink sweatshirt,I gave this sweatshirt as a gift for my sister. She is a hard core Red Soxs fan. She loves it but wishes the logo was a little bit bigger. Thank you very much.
1,Red Sox pink hoody sweatshirt,A good product and a good fit. Wish the logo had been a little bigger.
2,Confusing and difficult to implement...,"I'm a homeschool teacher and a former public school teacher, but found this book to be a great disappointment. I found the implementation to be difficult and disagree vehemently with some of the author's suggestions. For example, the author doesn't recommend reading or writing independently until the child has mastered a high level of mastery. In my experience, this is counterproductive to teaching a love of reading and writing. There are other phonics programs on the market that are far simpler and work much better. I'd urge homeschoolers, or other parents, to find a different method."
1,THERE ARE EASIER WAYS TO TEACH YOUR CHILD!!!,"I purchased this book along with Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons. I NEVER needed this book. It makes learning painful, tedious, miserable. Reading IS fun. This book is not. Buy the other one and forget about ""back to basics""--the old way is not the best way."
4,educational but lots of work,"I have read the book and am scrambling to impliment the resource. It has already taken me hours to read it and am currently looking for the lesson plans to actually use the material. A method it is, a set lesson plans it is not. I have learned a lot, however, with a total of two students as homeschool parent, my investment is now growing. I am however, hopeful for good results whether my search leads me to forming my own lesson plans or if I can buy the lesson plans.ADDENDUM:I found the lesson plans for the method from the Riggs Institute. Armed with Orton's method and now equipted with the lesson plan------my daughter is starting to understand and predict the nuances of the english language. All students would benefit from the method!!!!!!"
5,The Spalding method works!,"I am a product of the Spalding method. It was used in my first grade classroom in 1963-1964, and my mother owns a copy of the second edition of the book! I have also used it with my own children. Besides helping children learn to read and write, it also helps them learn to SPELL! Learning the spelling ""rules"" in the book all those years ago helped me be an excellent speller all through school as well as today, and it is helping my children. An excellent book, one that has stood the test of time."
3,Amazon sent me a dead watch,"The watch looks nice, but mother's day is in 3 days and it arrived DOA. I hope it's just a dead battery. I'm going to have to bring it in to a watch shop for a new battery, which will run another $20 since I don't have time to return it. Shame on you amazon for not checking to make sure it worked before shipping."
5,I love it!!!,It's so easy to apply and makes my eyebrows look wonderful! I recommend the bare escentuals eyebrow brush with this.
3,"great product, wrong color","I have used this product for several years and love it. I just apply with an eyebrow brush and it lasts all day, looks very natural. However, when I ordered, there was a box to click on for each color, the buyer has to click on which color they want. I chose the dark blonde/ash blonde whichever exact color it said, and noticed that it defaulted back to auburn so i chose again and progressed with the order. Apparently it went back to auburn somewhere during the ordering process. I didn't return it because it would not be worth it to pay return shipping and then buy the correct color.I did receive the shipment promptly and in excellent condition. This was not the fault of the seller."
2,not the right color,It was not what I expected. Spills all over when you open it. Did not like and was not happy with it.Gina Marie
5,The Best,I have used this product for several years. I love it. And the best part is it lasts a really long time!
4,Easy to use,"Love the ease of use, just dip your brow brush and apply. The color selection met my needs, and the powder itself gives coverage that is not too thick."
3,Brief but good for review of basics,"This is not in great detail but I found it valuable after being away from obedience training, getting a CD some 25 years ago. I notice tho that the book I got is copyright 2003 and the author is Nikki Moustaki (on the cover). I do not know what if any changes from book by Dan Gentile."
1,Price-quantity review,The product feature and the title of the products says: 3 dozen....but when you go to the product description it says 1.5 dozens.Are you advertising 3 dz snails at that price or 1.5 dz snails.BIG DIFFERENCE !!!!
5,GREAT FILM,"Meet The MayorGREAT FILM, 5 STARS, MEET THE MAYOR, IS A WONDERFUL FILM. YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PAUSE UNTIL THE END.."
1,Unbelievable propaganda,"The book is utter rubbish. Pure polemics, biased predetermined opinions, little of which has any basis in verifiable fact. Nothing like taking a position and then either creating data or misinterpreting data to support it, rather than the other way around. Don't be fooled into believing it. This man is obviously a Jewish anti-semite (oxymoron?)."
1,Great book if you have no soul,"This book is the same repackaged drivel you can expect from the anti-Israel lobby. Israel is the only bright spot in the middle east, the author seems to ignore this and puts all of the blame on the victims of arab genocidal hatred... but it's ok to hate, rape, murder, and steal. as long as you do it to a kaffur (non-muslim person)."
1,Horrible Book - Waste of Time. Lacked Logical Thinking,"This is a poorly written book by Michael Neumann. I am an avid reader and love to read about the different perspectives regarding issues which are important to us today, although this book is not worth a penny or the time. His claims clearly go against reported and factual history, and if I had to make a decision - the land should be the land of Israel.This is a hateful text with virtually no scholarly support - Israel is the land of the Jewish people and this book makes me lose great respect for all Arabs."
1,Shameful,"Michael Neumann should be ashamed of himself. As a Jew, this is by far the most disgusting thing I have seen in a long time. Self-loathing, and virulently anti-Semitic, Neumann should move to the Palestinian territories and see what happens."
1,Good read...if you're into fiction!,"If you are an anti-semite and are looking for more ""ammunition"" against the Jews and Israel, this is the book for you.If, on the other hand, you like to read facts and real historical data, don't waste your time with this book."
5,COMPELLING INDICTMENT OF ISRAEL'S POLICIES AGAINST PALESTINIANS,Well documented analysis of Israel's apartheid and sadistic policies against entire Palestinian populations under occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.This book by a principled and brave writer like Michael Neumann is another compelling and revealing indictment of the daily human rights abuses suffered by the Jewish state's palestinian victims (christians and moslems alike) on a daily basis and which regretfully are systematically ignored or underreported by the zionist or neocon controlled so called mainstream media.
1,Do NOT Buy,"From the title this sounds like its some good softcore sexy stuff. No sir. Boring, lame, NO NUDITY!!!! How can it have no Nudity? Why is it rated R, it could have been PG.So lame, the caveman joke gets old after 5 minutes. The women are hot, but don't expect to seem them naked, even though the title says ""BC 'Before Clothes'"". they have no 'clothes' but plenty animal skin modestly covering all the goods.A disappointment from something weird."
1,Just say no,"Stink, Stank, Stunk, unwatchable literally and figuratively. The absolute worst film quality I've ever seen, and don't let the title fool you there is almost zero ""before no clothes""...."
2,"Puppet Master ""Axis of Evil""","What happened to the great acting in the Puppet Master series? This film was a real letdown. I have been an avid fan of this series since the very first film, Puppet Master. This film is not anywhere near how the originals were acted. The actors are horribly amateur. Each puppet was only shown once in the film and they are the main reason I watch these films. I wanted to see more puppet action, not bad acting. The evil madame was the worst campy bad guy (girl) I've ever seen in a movie. No, this is not how I envisioned this movie to be. And then they don't even finish the story, they leave it open ended so they can make another one. Not cool.Stick to the originals. Buy Puppet Master 3 Toulon's Revenge (the Best), or Retro Puppet Master (second Best),or even Puppet Master 1 or 2,4,5. Any other one is better than this one.Sure, the originals had some campiness to them, But it was classy campy!"
2,complete fail,"simply put this was a disappointment, dont waste your time with this. I am a big fan of the puppet master series and the puppets were in the movie for about 20 minutes total and basically did nothing. With all of the technology available to update this movie franchise, I implore Charles Band......please stop making movies if you are not willing to put forward the proper financing and effort, congratulations on ruining a classic horror series.............."
2,A boring dissapointment,I had high expectations for this movie. I didn't expect it to be all that great but this was terrible. I found myself fast forwarding through the movie and after a while I just turned it off. The puppets hardly do anything and they don't even look as good as they did in the first 5 movies. What a train wreck.
1,The Puppet Master series has to end HERE!,"First off, let me state that I'm a huge Puppet Master fan. I own all the previous movies, both good and bad, but this one by far is the worst, even ""Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys"" was better than this disappointment. And to think Charles Band went all the way to China to film ""Axis of Evil."" He could've saved the airfare and filmed this mediocrity in his back yard with money to spare.I guess I was taken in by Band's vidcasts where he gave weekly reports on the progress of the film. I really thought this was going to be a winner like the third film in the series, ""Puppet Master 3: Toulon's Revenge."" But I was so wrong. So very wrong.Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice . . . ."
3,not like the older puppetmaster movies,this movie just does not show to much of the puppets at all if they make another puppetmaster movie they need to show more of the puppets in the movie and the ending well it just did not end right to me ???? other then that the movie is ok but the older puppetmaster movies are a lot better then this one .
2,Not for the Well Informed. Beginners Will Enjoy,"I was really excited about purchasing this book but ultimately very disappointed.I have read many diet and nutrition books so this particular item was not impressive. The questionairre may be enlightening for someone who has either: never been on a diet, or never really thought much about their motivations behind food.When I completed the questionairre it told me to Count Calories which I know from past experience does not work for me.It does have some good information for a beginner. Maybe someone who just needs to take off 25 pounds of recent weight gain but I would not suggest this for anyone who has tried multiple diets. It won't tell you anything new."
1,Surprising results,"I myself am a scientist, and I followed the procedures described as carefully as would a conscientious beginning student in chemistry. Alas, I did not drop an ounce, and developed a truly stupendous case of flatulence.Much recommended by arbiters of such things, but I wonder if these arbiters spend time in public, or have a sex life. I do not think so."
3,One Week,"The movie displays how numerous bad decisions can make your life, at the very least, more difficult. I enjoyed seeing Chicago prominently displayed. Think before you act!"
5,Touching!,"Touching.....splendid! I have been sharing it with my friends. But, how is it that movies like these, never reach the cinemas/theatres, when others(that don't make any sense) do??? This is great....the characters seem real..."
5,Speechless,Never take anything for granite. Examine your life and understand everything in your past could affect the present and the future.
4,Remarkable and Educational,This movie is an excellent way to show young teenager the reality of AIDS. This movie shows the two sides of the African- American culture. The so-call player and working black man and their decisions for their life. This movie demonstrates no one is invisible from AIDS.
1,skip it.,"A rather drab, slowly edited/paced and elementarily acted piece that put me to sleep with its predictability. Shows like a boring issue-based student film - only most student films last about 30 minutes, whereas this one drags on for an hour and a half."
4,A Dark surprise,"A lot of the lyrics are angry, and you can hear it in the music. There's a story behind the album to justify the anger. The sound was dark, and after the singles, I was skeptical, but this quickly grew on me as another powerful album, probably better than their second one."
5,As advertised,Carbon paper is hard to find in stores. A bit pricey but it gets the job done and it could be used over & over again. Great quality product. Worth every penny.
4,NuKote Carbon Paper,"I needed some carbon paper for my child to use at school. this product seems to suit the need. They are able to make copies of the notes without having to xerox them. This helps out the teacher, who has no money for supplies due to pro ration. The student doesn't have to give up their notes until the teacher can find a way to make a copy. My child or any other child absent can get the notes whenever absent."
2,Dont waste your money,"Unless you have never owned a dog, do not buy this book. It is a good ""dog"" book but it does not focus on the breed. Its all the common sense training, feeding, grooming, etc that a dog owner would already know.If you have never owned a dog, this is a good training aid"
5,My mother had this book when she was little.,"Let me start out by saying that my mother had this book when she was little. She loved this book and still remembers many of these little verses. Such as: ""You love yourself, You think you're grand, You go to the movies and hold your hand, You put your arm around your waist, And when you get fresh, You slap your face!""""Grandma has a habit, Of chewing in her sleep, She chews on Grandpa's whiskers, And thinks it's shredded wheat."""
5,Extremely cute book,I purchased this book over 10 years ago and still have it. It is such a wonderful book. The majority of it is silly but still very cute. It is worth picking up and reading all the way through. They are all short poems so its very easy to read. I just love this book. It is definitely for the younger readers but I can't part with it.
2,Could have been a lot better.,"I don't know why Hollywood continually portrays men as tongue-tied inepts, but it is way beyond reality.Max Schmelling was a real neat person who left this world a little better than he found it. I am encouraged by Schmelling's willingness to do the right thing in the midst of WW II oppression.I did not appreciate the foul language in this movie. This is another way that Hollywood damages people by permeating their ""product"" with swearing. It ruins an otherwise decent movie.For that reason, I destroyed this movie. I will not permit my children to be desensitized by this bad example. It's very sad, but not very surprising.You can read about Max Schmelling's life on the internet and it is a very inspiring story.gcw,husband & father"
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"I tried to read this book. I seriously tried. It wasn't the concept, but I can't say exactly what turned me off to it. I have most of her books & have liked the biggest part of them. If a person is in the mood for fantasy, it could work. I wouldn't look for any thread of reality though."
4,Not much to say,"It's a ball joint, it works! what else can one say. I have had terrible luck with my balljoints so far."
5,Shy life at its best,"The author clearly explains how shyness is a normal human emotion which sometimes becomes excessive in ways that block the fulfillment of personal goals. This book provides significant insights into how and why contemporary North American culture can be a particularly difficult social environment for shy people. Erika Hilliard advocates an approach through which a person can accept what is positive about being shy while at the same time learning how to work through excessive shyness, one step at a time. Her many years of experience as a leader of groups for shy people shine through in her rich examples and warm tone that help the shy reader feel not only informed but also truly understood. Her concluding chapter is an outstanding guide to how a shy person can use this book as a resource for renewing and maintaining motivation in spite of setbacks that might be encountered."
3,A lesser re-hash of more helpful books,"I was hoping this book would explore shyness in more depth and reveal deeper insights about its roots in the psyche. It was rated well, so I bought it, and I've found it hasn't really helped my understanding much. I feel like I could have writtten a lot of it from the knowledge I already have. I would recommend Feeling Good(if you haven't read it) by David Burns over this because I think it is a more direct and practical guide that more broadly and thoroughly addresses anxiety and depression.This book may be okay for someone who is addressing his/her shyness for the first time, but besides a lot of beating around the bush about how it's okay to be shy, the true insight was lacking. The practical steps to take in learning to cope with shyness were less potent versions of exercises better described in other books. I would not call it ""a comprehensive guide to gaining social confidence"" and think that is a promise it doesn't keep despite it's good intention."
2,A Comprehensive Guide? Not exactly,If I am reading a book about how to overcome shyness and the physical symptoms I would have expected it to teach you such exercises. The majority of this book tells you why you are shy and that it is not a bad thing you should pretty much just accept it and get over it. If you want to know why you are shy and what may or may not have happened to you in the past to make you more susecptable then read this book. If you want to know steps or practices to avoid while raising your child to prevent them from becoming shy then read this book.
3,Not a solution!,"Estroven worked well for me in the beginning, but after about 6 months I was right back to more frequent and severe hot flashes. Just recently went back on the low-dose estrogen patch, only thing that works for me!"
2,estroven,"The product was shown as only needing to take one a day, but the bottle states needing to take 2 per day. I was very disappointed in this as I would not have bought them knowing this. I don't believe they are the same as the one a day extra strength ones I buy in the store because they don't seem to work as well."
3,Disappointing DVD,"Ross, Diana - Paris 1968This is not the complete original show ... but I guess its better to have something than nothing. However for fans like me who have seen the original concert in bootleg form ... several questions come up immediately:1) Why is there a 1970's Mahogany photo of a solo Ross on the cover?2) What happened to the interview when the girls tell the host their ages (only 23 years old, believe it or not)and Ross speaks to him in French and talks about Tamla Motown?3) What's up with the choppy ""MTV"" video editing at the end of each song?And the biggest question of all... what's really the point of releasing historical archival footage if it's going to be altered?All in all, its quite disappointing but the remastered sound and visual quality still makes it a keepsake."
2,Not worth the money.,"I'm a HUGE Diana Ross fan an expected so much more from this dvd. First of all it's way to short. It's advertised more as a Diana Ross concert dvd not the Supremes which it really is. Also the footage is of very bad grainy black and white quality and is edited poorly. I was very disappointed, you will be too... don't waste your money."
3,for Diana fans only!,"Diana is in great form here.So are Mary and Cindy,unfortunately the sound mix is such that M&C can barely be heard.The full verson of Michele is rare as it was often presented as a medley wth Yesturday.Other DVD's feature almost all of these numbers and more from concerts around the same time at other venues.The other videos have better sound,and give better balance of the background parts ,in my opinion."
5,Bought this as a gift,"This was a Christmas gift for someone who is very hard to buy for. A great, well priced find. He loved it!"
3,Worth The Money,"Miss Ross and the Supremes are great as usual, but the video quality leaves something to be desired. That said, I'd do it again."
2,dissapointment,This is not a Diana Ross concert but undoubtedly a Supremes show. The picture quality is not good - the distant shots are bit foggy but the close-ups are ok. The cover is misleading - one would imagine that it'd be a Diana Ross concert (the cover shot is from her solo career) - it ain't. The show is about 20+ minutes long - definitely not worth the price. I gave it two stars only because Diana Ross is in it.
5,So thrilled,"I'm excited to see this DVD! Hoping it is solo Diana Ross but even if it has those background singers it'll be okay. People are trying to discredit a bonafide music legend like Diana and say that Mary Wilson was the better performer but - I call a spade a spade and Mary Wilson is tacky, ignorant and low class. ....just like her senile old loser fans!!!!LOVE that they left Supremes off the title! Mary Wilson's pathetic fans are grinding their false teeth!!! Lmfao! Diana Ross FOREVER."
1,For fans only (and the mad ones)!,I'm very disapointed whit this video for two reasons. The quality of the image is very bad and the show is very short (less than 25 Minutes). The show has been cut. The french show in not complete.I'cant understand why the image is so bad. I own the french version registered on french tv and the image is very good! So what?
1,FEELING RIPPED OFF,"I think the dvd is crap. It is blurry, bad sound. It has only six songs. I have already put it in the trash can."
1,WHAT?,"I am bewildered, honestly!And I don't like the implication! And You can say what you 'want' all those that may think whatever they want! But THIS is 1968!Diana Ross was NOT a SOLO act! WHY the solo name? THIS is Diana Ross and The SUPREMES! Where ARE they? To ME this is UTMOST DISRESPECT! I cannot help perpetuate this insult to the legacy!WhoEVER did THIS should be repramanded, and the misconception corrected! The picture is even 'post-Supremes' Diana!It may ""NOT"" seem like an 'issue' to some, But to ME, one who has been sooo impacted by the legacy, that it molded my whole musical LIFE, I am appalled that someone Could EVER discount ANY part of this PHENOMENON called THE SUPREMES, without WHICH there would NEVER have BEEN a Diana Ross!"
4,good But not the best,A very good case. protects well from all angles. My only beef with this case is that the little clip that holds the case closed pops open. with the way it opens there is no threat to the mp3 player. just a little annoying to look down and find it open.
5,Great case,"I did a lot of searching for a good case for my Sansa E250. Most I found fell short in one way or another, but this Belkin case doesn't. It covers the entire player (except for the main controls), even the screen, and the belt clip is solid. The design almost seems backwards when you look at the photo, but it's actually rather ingenious. Unlike many other cases, when it's clipped to your belt, the front of the player faces you. When you release the latch near the top of the case, the player lays back in your hand so that it's facing you, right-side up, making it very easy to read the display and work the controls. Brilliant! Even the blue accents on the case coordinate nicely with the Sansa's display. I've had this case for about a year now, and use it almost daily. It's held up just fine, and I'm loving it. Highly recommended."
4,first impressions...,"I like this case, it can completely cover the sansa and it has a belt clip. When it's open the connector on the bottom of the sansa is accessible.Pros -* Case is snug an secure* Construction appears to be of high quality* When clipped to a belt or pocket the case opens so that the sansaflips outwards for easy access.Cons -* Power button is a little difficult to operate, not really a problemfor me but others may object."
3,Think twice,"I was surprised. The video reminds me of a B movie, with cheesy music, poor voice quality and poorly dressed actors. The excercises move quickly and certainly warm a person up. The ab work is good. Its not what I expected."
3,A.M.T review,"American Musical Theater by Gerald Bordman, is a text that I am currently using for a college class. To keep this review Short I will not go into great length about the specifics of the book. Just let me say that it is long, (800+ pages) and it feels that way. It is sorta like reading a dictionary, or index. What I mean is, there is soo much information, both usefull and useless, that deciphering it becomes an impossible task. If you were to read a dictionary cover to cover, how many words would you actually learn? The musicals are grouped according to year and season, not overall importance. Also, when a show is revived, it breaks this year by year context, creating more confusion. Perhaps ranking in order of importance would promote unity. Otherwise I would recommend a lighter book of similar subject matter. Still as a complete resource, this book is invaluable, in the same way a dictionary is to spelling questions, this book is to questions on American musicals."
4,Not For Sleeping On,"I'm writing this review because we thought we could use the couch for sleepovers, but when open it is nowhere near long enough to sleep on (even for my two year old who is petite for her age). I guess the flip open design is more for lounging on than anything else.We've had this couch for four months and it's held up well overall. My 4 and 2 year old kids like sitting side by side and looking at books on it."
5,Wonderful!,"New Light Dawning is inspirational - not only because of the content of the songs Kevin Scott Hall has chosen and/or written, but also because of his gorgeous tenor voice.I highly recommend this CD!"
3,Not the greatest,"I have all four Trick Daddy CD's and this one didn't meet up to my expectations for Trick. He usually lays it down fierce but some of the problems with this CD is that his back ground beats aren't all that tight, and he's got some no name artist on there who can't really rap. Trick makes up for it with his flows cuz he does have some tight lyrics. Three songs of the CD you can get from some where else so theres really not that many songs. On the up beat, if you have subs this CD does bump and there are a couple songs that are phat. If you just really like Trick Daddy, then swoop it up. If your a first time listener, I'd swoop up Book Of Thugs instead of Thugs are Us. Personally I fell into the hype and was a little disappointed when I got the CD."
2,coulda been better,"trick daddy is a great artist. i love his southern drawl and his i don't give a.... attitude. his music has always been catchy, and that's why, to this day, i buy it. but ""thugs r us"" is definately at the bottom of the T double D list. songs like ""i'm a thug"", ""where i'm from"", ""to all my ladies"" were very catchy but the rest of the album was filled with too many no names and subpar beats. ""the drought"" was very dull, ""n word"" is repetively boring and ""bricks and marijuana"" sounded like a sean paul song. overall, i bought the cd based on the name, trick daddy, cuz he's one of my favorite rappers. but this is one of those albums killed by too many guests. anyway, i'll still keep buying the boy's albums cuz i know he can do better than this. slip n slide baby!"
3,could've been better,"I like this cd but there is one thing missing, the Culture Club.I think trick daddy should've colaberated with the Culture Club on his album.I think Boy George could have made it a five star album."
3,"""Livin Up To His Image""","TRICK DADDY'S NEW ALBUM IS BASED ON HIM BEING A THUG.HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING A THUG,SO THATSHIS IMAGE AND HE LIVES UP TO IT IN HIS NEW ALBUM.THE ALBUM HAS A VARIETY OF SONGS;IT HAS SLOW RELAXING TEMPOS AND BEATS, AND CLUB LIKE SONGS."
1,TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY!!!,"This item proves that you get what you pay for. It is low in price but also low in quality. The static on my radio actually sounded better BEFORE I plugged this thing in. At best, all I got was very faint music from my iPod, mixed in with all the static. But the majority of the time, it was all static. It was returned promptly."
4,this is a Maxi CD single of 'Surrender',This has four tracks 1 Surrender (edit)3:58 - 2 Surrender (Ext.version) 4:35 -3 From a Million Miles 4:34 - 4 Take Me Back (unreleased track)2:50 .
1,matt splitter,Sorry to say this matt splitter dose not work at all! It's dull and can't cut thru my Aussie's mat's! Wish I could give a positive review but it is worthless.
4,mat splitter,"This is a good product that I bought for my long haired cat. However, he was so mated, right down to the skin, that I had to take him in to the vet for a shave. He feels much better now. Good for mats that aren't that severe."
4,Great old standard splitter,"I used one of these in the late 60's to groom Afghan hounds....got a mini poodle recently and she was covered in mats. Used properly, this one one of the greatest tools to have in your grooming box.Always have the blade away from the skin of the dog."
1,WHILE I WAS SLEEPING,"CAME THROUGH AMAZON, NICE ON TIME AS ALWAYS.BUT THIS ITEM LOOKS OLD, LIKE AS IF IT WAS USED PREVIOUSLY. SAFETY PLASTIC WAS ALREADY DAMAGED WHEN I GOT THIS PRODUCT.IT IS NOTHING EXITING.IF YOU DO BUY FIRST CAREFULLY CUT OUT THE PACKAGING, THEN PULL THE SPLITTER OUT DONT PULL FIRST.I DONT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYBODY.SORRY.I NEVER DID BUT YOU CAN TRY SEARCHING IN OSTER BRAND. NOW THATS SOME OF THE BEST STUFF I HAVE USED.CHECK IT OUT"
5,It Works.,"Don't let the look intimidate you. Though this is a razor-sharp instrument, it's quite safe when used properly, and when you have a tough mat you need a sharp splitter. This is used to pull up vertically thru the mat like a pik. The blade itself is never against the skin. I used it on my elderly cat and his fragile skin wasn't tugged at all. After splitting the mat multiple times, I picked it out with a comb, then followed with a brushing. Five paws-up. =^..^=(Remember, this is a razor and should not be handled by children or anyone not willing to use it properly.)"
3,ZELDA SHOW,"This show makes me feel like I am conquering the world. It is a wonderful rendition of what life is really like in the world of hyrule. Right after I finished watching it, (for the 87th time), I couldn't help but hook up my old NES and play the Legend of Zelda. I've beat it, along with all of the other Zelda games, multiple, (and I mean multiple), times.This DVD would be made more complete if it had commentary by the directors. My friends and I thought it would be funny to add the commentary ourselves so on about our 46th time of watching it, we turned the volume on mute, and had a field day. We were hilarious. I hope this review is helpful. May the force be with you.Grab some Doritios and watch this DVD. It's beautiful."
4,Hooray!,"These are the Care Bears I remember! Before Nelvana trapped them up in the clouds and had them engage in endless battles with a Gargamel-inspired villain, DIC let the Care Bears roam Earth trying to actually help kids with real problems. Problems like new braces, school bullies and fear of the dark. Sure, it had its moments with Freeze and Co. but these Care Bears seemed much more down to Earth. After Nelvana got their hands on them (and yes I know they did the movies) the Care Bears got way way too cutesy wutesy. Okay, the DIC animation is, well, DIC animation but I think it has a far more organic feel than what came later. I say, pick these DVD's up!"
4,Care Bears!!!,"What girl didn't like Care Bears? I know I did. Haha!! This is from DIC which is known for their lousy color, sound and production. Other than that, a must-have for all you Care Bear lovers out there."
3,Could have been much better,"My daughter loves the Care Bears to pieces, so when I bought her this DVD, I thought she'd be thrilled. BORING...yawn. The stories are so lame, the animation is LOUSY!! The colors are dull, blah, very unprofessional. The characters seem to hesitate between frames. Cheap quality, a big disappointment."
1,Doesn't work,"Batteries that came with charger never worked. Charger worked badly at first (didn't fully charge batteries that didn't come with the charger). Now, a few months later, it doesn't charge batteries at all. The light showing that the batteries are charged switches on a couple of minutes after I switch on the charger. The ""charged"" batteries won't even get my camera to turn on, let alone last long enough to take a photo. Waste of money."
2,THIS EDITION IS ABRIDGED !,This version of Mondo Magic has had about 11 minutes of footage cut from it. The original uncut version is out of print. I am hoping it will be rereleased in its original uncut version.
1,very sick yet very stupid!!!,"I have seen some sick movies in the past and this movie dosnt even come close... Belive me dont waste your money , if you are that intrested rent it at your nearest white trash video stores. If you want somthing to freak you out to the point where you want to turn your t.v off rent traces of death... this movie is a classic and I know a classic when I see one..."
1,No no no!,"If you believe that global warming is a hoax and we are maintaining 'no net loss' of wetlands in the US, then this book is for you.If you have any sort of scientific knowledge about the environment you will find numerous assumptions and 'facts' that are simply awful and give naive readers the wrong impression about the actual state of the planet.This book is in my recyling bin."
2,The closer I get the less I see.,"When the authors get close to something I am very familiar with, like the recycling rates, the presented ""facts"" fall apart. This causes me to question the book. Also, the authors must be very embarassed by the current price of gasoline in the states, having asserted that we are immune to energy shocks. It is too easy, and often not very helpful, to say what we don't know and to call things into question. This paralyzing approach will not save endangered species, or improve our environment."
3,"Great movie, shame about the transfer","I LOVE this movie and once it was announced on DVD I pre-ordered. The DVD is fine and contains a great 50 min featurette on Nico Mastorakis. My main problem with this DVD is that it's ""widescreen"". While checking with my old worn-out fullframe VHS, I found that the movie has been cut in the top and bottom of the picture to make it ""widescreen"". This causes some points of the comedy to be missed out and in one particular scene almost all the heads are cut off..."
3,good for 1st year students,If you've never studied Greek and don't remember all the titles for english grammer then its probably pretty usefull. After your first year you'll already know everything in it.
5,The Jewish Phenomenon,"This book is written to help and educate Jews and people of other faiths alike. This book explains the reasons behind the past and current great success of Jewish People. It explains why this is so prevalent in the Jewish People, and their values concerning education and the use of money. This book will be a source of renewed Jewish pride for those Jews who have lost sight of, or never knew the extent of the contributions of the current Jewish population."
3,Title is misleading,"This book is filled with interesting statistics but there is very little information on how others can apply the seven ""keys"" to their own lives. If you're interested in knowing the statistical information about the success of the Jews, this book is for you. However, if you're looking for a ""how to"" book on achieving financial success, I recommend you keep looking. Peronally, I enjoyed reading this book and I found the statistics truly remarkable."
5,Becoming A Jew,Fantastic information on how a person learns to be a Jew. How parents raise their children with the values and culture to be a Jew. Great information.111 Wonderful Ways To Build Children's Self Esteem & Confidence Everyday
3,more or less,A lot of statistics. Too much marketing about jews and little about really HOW the principles works. It's a complementary reading about this topic. 3 starts means more or less.
1,don't try to buy this garlic press from amazon,"Don't try to buy this item from Amazon. I tried twice, and was sent the wrong garlic press each time. I received a full refund but lost several hours of my time. I really wanted this garlic press because I own one and think it is great. But Target, which is the actual seller, kept sending the Susi 2 press, which is not what I wanted. I spent a lot of time with customer service people after the first error trying to avoid the same error a second time. To no avail! Look elsewhere if this is the garlic press you want."
1,Leifheit Garlic Press is a much better Product,"I found this product to be too light, flimsy and hard to clean. I had to discard it. I went to Williams-Sonoma online and found another made by Leifheit. This one is great. Spend a few more $ and get the Leifheit Garlic Press, you won't be sorry. My friend also found it at Crate and Barrel."
4,Great Mincer - Hard to Clean,"This little gizmo squeezes the bejeezsus out of small to medium-sized garlic cloves and after a month of using it mine still hasn't broken.However, the little plastic clean-up assist part that was included with mine promptly bit the dust after a few of the plastic pins misaligned with the garlic press holes and broke-off. Afterwards the plastic cleaning punch became useless. I'm back to using a small brush to clean the garlic press.Note that the promo says this unit minces garlic cloves without peeling; well, that is somewhat true but only if you're planning to mince only a couple of cloves of garlic before clean-up. Also, when you press an unpeeled clove it seems that the juices squirt out the back side (in my face!) almost as much as they do thru the die (holes). Solution: peel the cloves before mincing."
4,"It works great, but...","It works great, but the problem I've found is cleaning it after use. The detachable plastic cleaner has a very short life and that's where you start to have clean up problems. As you really do need a tool to poke out the garlic residue out and using a knife becomes very frustrating at times, especialty when you are pressing a large batch of garlic. That said though this press has been the best performer I've come across with little waste (others usually squirt garlic down and also around the opening too). If zyliss were to address this design fault regarding the plastic clean up tool this would be a 5 star product, not just four. May your cooking be appreciated, bye."
1,paint came off! Gret in my garlic,Yuch! Health hazard??? The paint is coming off my press. The garlic is coming out grey!!! SO not buy this. The plastic piece included can be easily lost. The press is hard to press. Have to press very hard. Worst i have had! It is in the garbage and now to buy a different style and brand.
4,Garlic Press,This garlic press is by far the best one I've ever used. It does an excellent job of crushing garlic cloves without even having to peel the cloves first. The down side it that it is a bit difficult to clean. It is not the press I wanted. Zyliss makes another press that comes with a blue rubber tool for cleaning.
1,Turns my garlic black.,"I just threw mine away after finding out that the garlic press's corrosive black stuff probably contains aluminum. Mechanically, the garlic press is great, but potential aluminum poisoning is not a good trade-off! Until I know for sure what that black stuff is, I'll be in the market for a stainless steel garlic press."
2,Quality is less than cost,"The garlic press is well constructed and is as good as any other press I have used in the last 30 years.Serious Problem: The soft plastic cleaning tool has cleaning tips that are so soft that they bend and do not fit into the holes in the press head and therefore make cleaning a very difficult task.I bought 2 of the presses with the intent of giving one of them as a gift to a friend of mine.But after using the press that I bought for my own use, I could NEVER offer this product as a gift and would discourage others seeking a really GOOD garlic press seek one that has metal construction like this press BUT has something better than a cheap soft plastic head cleaning tool.I had such a combination, but someone borrowed it and never returned it. So there IS a better product available - somewhere."
3,The cleaning tool doesn't wear well,"The garlic press itself is great. The cleaner is a special added feature. Unfortunately, the cleaner did not wear at all well; enough of its prongs had bent or broken within 18 months to make it useless. We have been unable to find where a new cleaner can be purchased separately. Once the cleaner is gone, the press is difficult to clean."
5,"Excellent Garlic Press, But Dishwasher Safe?","A number of people have written to say that their garlic presses lose their shiny finish when put in the dishwasher. I had the same experience with my trusty Zyliss garlic press: after two years of hand-washing, I put it in the dishwasher for the first time this week. Not only had it lost its shiny finish, but the garlic that I pressed with it became gray and unusable.But, there is a happy ending... I just contacted Zyliss' friendly customer support, where a representative told me that this is a known problem with the older versions, but that it's been fixed with the versions that are out now. They are now dishwasher-safe. She also offered to send me a new garlic press, if I mailed in my old one.So kudos to Zyliss' exceptional garlic press, and to their great customer support!"
1,Be VERY careful. Potential health hazard.,"Watch out if you think Alzheimers might be linked to to much aluminum in your diet. The paint (no it is not anodized) flakes off within months to reveal raw Aluminum which corrodes fast, especially in your dishwasher. My 3 month old one is pushing out gray discolored garlic now, so it's in the bin. This is my 3rd one to do this over the years, so no way I am getting one of these again.Remember that a lot of the reviews here are from people who have had it only a short time and it will not be exhibiting this behavior for them yet.The design is the best I have found, but why did they paint it?? If they made it out of stainless, I would give it 5 stars. But right now my health is to important to risk using this product anymore."
4,"Great garlic press, unfortunately small capacity","I like this garlic press. It does a good job of squeezing out all of the garlic and you can put the clove in the hopper peel and all. The only difficulty is that some quite large cloves won't fit in the hopper and must be cut in half. This is annoying as it adds an extra step. Another quibble: I don't have much hand strength and I find that I must press a bit harder with this press than with the OXO press I had previously. However, I would rate this press much higher than the OXO, because although it seems much flimsier, it has proven to be much more durable. (My old OXO press is in two pieces!)."
3,"Great, if you are only pressing one clove of garlic!","This is a great invention; no need to peel the garlic first. However, if you want to press more than one clove, realize that all the skin from the first clove is inside the press. You have two choices: clean it out, (and my ""cleaning tool"" broke after about 6 months) or leave it in. If you leave the skin in, and you then put another clove in, it's really hard to press, and little bits of skin will actually come out!I do not use this press when I want to add a lot of garlic, because it's just too much of a bother.The search for the perfect press continues..."
1,Flimsy,"Have used this product for about 1 year. The plastic cleaner pegs bend easily and become useless so the press becomes very hard to clean. Finally, when pressing several cloves at once, the entire bottom of the press broke off in one hunk. Also, the aluminum had badly discolored. Look elsewhere for a garlic press."
4,Works surprisingly well!,"This is a very well-designed product -- it's quite amazing how you can put unpeeled garlic in, and only the garlic sans skin comes out. However, I would suggest one possible improvement: the ""well"" where you place the garlic should be bigger, as large cloves do not fit. Note that because the garlic is crushed much more finely than when it's chopped, less garlic needs to be used, since the finer it's chopped, the more flavor it releases."
1,leaves aluminium dust in your garlic!,"I've had mine for >1 year. I noticed the garlic has a grayish tint to it. This has been getting worse and worse. I recently noticed my hands, after using this, have grey on them as well. I assumed it was harmless. But I just now looked up what material the press is made of and it's aluminium! Aluminium dust is toxic! I just threw this out.I'd suggest getting a stainless steel press instead."
3,"Great, but only for a while","Clever design, well made, works wonderfully...until the tiny prongs on the plastic cleaning tool become deformed and no longer align with the holes in the press"
2,"Good concept, bad product.","This garlic press is a flimsy hunk of junk. The garlic chamber is very small so the garlic clove needs to be cut. It does work, but garlic juice squirted everywhere and the unit is so flimsy that it feels like it's going to break with any pressure."
5,Question,I really have no review. Have had many garlic presses in the past which I have thrown out. All of them seem to squish a little garlic out the holes and the rest of the garlic clove surges up around the presser part. Is there a garlic press that will squish ALL the garlic clove out through the holes?
5,"IT STINKS WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY,","PRICE RIP OFF ON NET,YOU CAN GET IT FOR 1/2 THE PRICE AT YOUR LOCAL TARGET STORE"
3,Generic,"Anorexia Nervousa bring nothing new to the forefront of melodic black metal, I honestly don't see why so many people like this band. I'm not saying their terrible, their quite proficent with their instruments and everything, but it's all been done before. Cradle of Filth, Agathoidaimon, Lord Belial, Graveworm, Dimmu Borgir, Borknager, Old Mans Child, Catamenia... are some of many bands that out rank Anorexia Nervousia in terms of originality and talent. All AN try to do is follow in these bands shadows. Don't waste your money on these second-handers, if your considering buying this I would recommend checking out some of the bands I mentioned above instead, to begin with. Then look around a bit, there's plenty of bands out there with a more unique approach to black metal."
4,Wolfe meets his Moriarty,"Also titled More Deaths Than One, this is the first and best of the Arnold Zeck trilogy. If you want to read it in order, follow this with The Second Confession and Even in the Best Families, although personally I rate the latter a very poor Wolfe. None of this stops And Be a Villain from being one of the better stories, with Stout having lots of fun at the expense of the commercial world, a frequent theme during his post-war period."
4,Soliciting Cases,"Wolfe's demeanor often gets us thinking that he is way too dignified to solicit business. Yet there are a few cases, such as this one, where he actually does ""chase ambulances"" in order to maintain his cash flow.In 1948, the time frame for this case, radio was still king, and Cyril Orchard was a big name. He dies at the mike, very publicly, but no one knows what happened. Wolfe not only solicits the case from a corporation, he also agrees that he'll get paid only if and when he solves it.This puts Wolfe right in there with the lowliest personal injury lawyer. Nowadays that's commonplace, but 57 years ago it was not the mark of a real professional.This one's at its best when Wolfe confronts the problem of a ""conspiracy of lies."" All involved agree to maintain the same front to the police and investigators, and Wolfe and Archie have to figure out how to ""get a crack started.""Great story - you'll love it."
4,"Lies, death and sponsors...","When somebody dies, live on the air, while drinking one of the radio shows sponsors' product, you can guess there is hell to pay. But when everybody connected to the case decides to lie Nero Wolfe almost decides to give the whole mess over to the police. This book has so much going for it - the plot, the interaction between Archie and Nero, and the most powerful and dangerous villain of all. And it is set in a world where radio is still king. How wonderful, how delightful, how cool.Buy it, read it, enjoy it, pass it on."
4,decent canteen cover,"I wish the side pocket was a little large, and that flap was secured with better velcro, but other than that, it's fine."
3,ordered by mistake,"In my rush I ordered the inserts rather than the air stones, but they're useful for piecing together tubing when you want to rearange the aquarium or you don't want to throw away all those small pieces of tubing. Just use the inserts to link multiple pieces of tubing to make one long tube."
5,a sinister blend of influences,"They cover the wierd stuff here, and their virtuosic talent makes it sound incredibly cool. They cover that wierdest of Residents' songs, ""Sinister Exaggerator"", and the album is therefore worth it."
4,hmmm...interesting...,"hmmmm...interesting...the greatest power trio in the universe doing covers of songs by bands who, for the most part, they sound absolutely nothing like. makes sense to me."
3,"Skeeter says ""buy me"".","I normally don't pay much attention to EP's or CD singles, but ""Miscellaneous Debris"" is hard not to like. Obviously it's short, and only 5 tracks, but two of them are excellent. In my opinion, ""Making Plans For Nigel"" is one of the best things Primus has ever done. It's just a rockin' XTC cover, and these are all covers by the way. The other is ""Have A Cigar"". Maybe it's because I dig Pink Floyd also, but's it great to hear them give it the ol' Primus touch. The other three tracks are decent as well. Album-wise you can't beat the first two, but give this a shot if you see it used."
3,4 Titles and lots of action.,"WWF SummerSlam 1993 was an average event. With 4 Championship Titles on the line, there could have been a lot more to see. WWF Champion-Yokozuna defends the title against ""Made in the U.S.A."" Lex Luger. WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Champion-Shawn Michaels vs. Challenger-Mr. Perfect. This match should decide who truly is the greatest I.C. Champ of all time. WWF Tag Team Titles on the line between Champions-The Steiner Brothers and Challengers-The Heavenly Bodies. WWF King of the Ring Title up for grabs between Bret ""Hitman"" Hart and Jerry ""The King"" Lawler. Also see Bret Hart wrestle Doink the Clown, the Rest In Peace match between the Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez, a 6-man tag between Tatanka & The Smoking Gunns and Bam Bam Bigelow & The Headshrinkers. Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Marty Jannetty vs. Ludvig Borga, 123 Kid vs. I.R.S."
4,HIGHLY INTISIPATED Pay per view,"I collect old wwf movies and wen i ordered summerslam 93 all the reviews were about hogan leavin and lex luger taking over , well lex was never really the main atraction it was always bret hart , undertaker and so on , lex luger only got 2 title shots in the whole time he was in the wwf so he was not really trying to replace hogan i thought. But anyway this was a great summerslam the card line up was good , it had bret hart vs doink , undertaker vs gonzolez and the match i wanted to see luger vs yokozuna for the world title it is a shame luger didnt win the title , and it is a shame he didnt stay with the wwf because i wanted to see him the champion atleast 1 time he had the stuff to be the champ , and i think he could have been maybe as big as hogan but he left. SUMMERSLAM WAS GREAT pic up this video will u still can for 14 bucks before it gets to 50 or 60 dollors."
3,SummerSlam '93,"This ppv event was first Summerslam w/o Hulk Hogan and man they sure as hell didn't miss his sorry ass. I'm not saying that this show was great or anything, but it kicked anything's butt that WCW was doing in 1993, that's for damn sure. Anyways, i wish that the WWF would start selling the old PPVs because they are so hard to find in good condition these days. I give this show 3 stars because it was just a regular ppv to me."
3,WWF Summerslam Review!,"With Hulk Hogan on his way out the door, the WWF needed a new star. Lex Luger was chosen as the next logical choice so they had him go on a campaign in his ""Lex Express"". The whole thing was pure cheese but a lot of fun to watch. Anyone, the new American hero takes on Yokozuna for the WWF Title here.You also get to see Bret Hart battle not only Doink The Clown but Jerry Lawler as well. You get to see the final match in The Undertaker-Giant Gonzolaez feud. There is also the pay-per-view debut of Ludvig Borga.On paper, the line-up looked pretty lousy but they did a decent job with it. I'm hoping that one day the WWF (er, WWE) releases the whole Summerslam collection the way they did with Wrestlemania."
2,Ambitious but unsuccessful,"While I admire Buscemi for attempting what can be one of the harder things to do on film - basically a two-actor script - I hated this. Yes, it's riveting - perhaps the film's deftist feat is its way of hooking the viewer back in every time the two characters threaten to part ways. But by the end I hated the actress and wasn't terribly fond of the journalist. I felt like I'd been enmeshed in the lives of two people unworthy of my time and attention. Also depressing was the ageist message/resolution. Made me nostalgic for films in which age and experience counts for something durable and respectable. Instead, this just drives home today's youth-uber-alles viewpoint."
1,Not so good,"The DVD jacket is totally misleading in its trying to sell the film as a comedy ""with a twist"". In fact, the writing is pretty bad, the directing is worse, and acting is wooden and stereotypical. Sienna tries hard but has little to hold on to.There is very little of interest here to attract the casual film watcher. The personal dynamics does not work, in fact, Buscemi is awfully irritating in his quasi-journalist role and I kept asking what would the Miller character see in Buscemi's ineptly played persona.84 wasted minutes. Caveat emptor is all I can say."
4,A remake that keeps the flavor of the original,"This is a tale within a tale, limited locations and sparse sets, really the tale of two actors, one a reporter who acts out to establish himself, the other an actor that he is supposed to interview-- and both realize that the other is not fully real during the interview.Yes, wonderful writing, excellent work, but it is for the introvert, not the extrovert, and doesn't quite break through the wall into the land of great storytelling. However this might be Sienna Miller's best work, so if you like her, this will please you.If not, Steve Buscemi as the actor/director is a good fit, and underplays the role so well that the final twist has some real bite.If action, adventure, or groundbreaking roles are your goal, sorry, but this is more filler than main course."
4,"taut dialogue, sharp, sexy","Well you need to be in the right mood for this film.Not much happens - physically - but the dialogue is very taut, funny, touching, frustrating and sexy.You should then watch it a second time with the sound off, just to watch Sienna Miller move.She captures the character beautifully."
4,The Mystery of Picasso,"This is a great movie for anyone who has ever wondered how a real work of art is created. Watch as Pablo Picasso creates works in color, black and white, paint, and ink.The only aspect of the film I did not enjoy was the soundtrack. It does not fit the action on screen and is sometimes unnecessarily loud."
3,For artists or Picasso fans only,"Historically worth watching to see a shirtless, smoking Picasso creating several spontaneous drawings and paintings on the fly. Starting from markers and moving up to oil paints the drawings and paintings vary from straight forward sketches to his more well known cubist style. Best if watched in fast forward. You still get the point but in half the time. The cover painting is shot in a ten minute span but actually took five hours for Picasso to paint. The cubist paintings are fascinating to watch as Picasso starts with a sketch and morphs it into cubism, seemingly adding and subtracting layers in a random fashion. Interesting but ultimatley boring. Most of the paintings are crap and this is coming from a huge Picasso fan. It makes sense that all twenty paintings were destroyed after the filming. A wonderful guide for a painter wanting to watch Picasso's creative process but possibly not very interesting to the casual viewer."
3,Read this before you buy,"The DVD was interesting. The ability of Picasso to look at the same concept in different ways was refreshing. However, my expectations were different considering the title of the feature and the picture on the cover. I had the impression that the DVD will include some sort of commentary by the artist himself revealing more about the thoughts that go on in his mind when he's in the process of painting.Having said that, you get still to see some interesting order -or lack of it; depending on how you see it- of how Picasso paints different parts of the painting at one time and then revisit them repeatedly to complete the painting. I guess you can say he demonstrated his thoughts rather than narrating them, but that narration would've really pushed it to a solid 5 out 5."
2,Kind of boring,"I bought this hoping to glean something from Picasso's work process to use in my own creativity process. All I can see is a man drawing . . and drawing . . and drawing. Maybe that's the whole point - that greatness is achieved not through some ""magic"" but by dedication, insight and practice, practice, practice.That's great but I haven't watched the whole DVD because I am truly bored."
1,Boring Picasso,"Picasso is one of the giants in the history of Art and surely THE artistic genious of the 20th Century, but this renders him boring and repetitive. It was done while he was alive, and has him ""painting"" little cartoon-like ""works"" that were done only for this DVD...one...after...the....other ad nauseum. This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Guernica. It looks as if he's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work. I turned it off after 30+ interminable minutes. Fortunately I rented it on Netflix, which I'd recommend, rather than buying it."
5,The Mystery of Picasso,"A fascinating, stunning original achievement, and a breathtaking visual experiment that pays off. This is a must-see for artists and all lovers of art and film. This movie gives a special immediacy to the larger-than-life figure of Picasso."
5,The Eye Molds the Canvas,A Fabulous film showing how an artist- in this case Picasso- takes a blank sheet of paper or canvas and transforms it into a work of art. Thru a special process that lets the inks bleed thru to the wrong side of the canvas where a camera captures the developement of a drawing from the first placement of a brush stroke to the final completed drawing/painting. Sometimes it is truly amazing to see what comes forth from the humble beginnings. We also are able to follow the developement of paintings as well with the aide of stop motion photography. I wish I were an art teacher so I could share this with my students! An enjoyable film for anyone with an interest in art!
4,Good for the money,Worked well on a number of herbs. Makes it easy to add fresh herbs to any dish. Cleans easily.
4,"Deep synths, light pop","Synthesizers got cheap in the late '70s. Go do something interesting with them. You don't have to show off like Maestro Rick Wakemen. You don't have to create ponderous Space Rock like Tangerine Dream. You can make a record like nobody's ever heard before. That's what OMD did on ""Junk Culture."" Processed horn sections, electronically filtered vocals, quirky percussive efects all never sounded so magnificent....and to think this was just a light pop music record. Critics? What did they know? They were too busy drooling over Van Halen's latest back then. OMD was not music for rock music critics; a primitive life form that could not possibly grasp an electroacoustic journey like ""Junk Culture""!"
4,Junk Culture-Loved The Title. It became my first OMD purchase.,"After buying this I fell in love with OMD and the album spent a lot of time on my turntable(dating myself). I never cared for instrumentals and always skip them so I ignored the title track, but the rest of the album was great. The songs have aged pretty well and my favorites are ones most people ignore. ""Love & Violence"", and ""Hard Day"" are brilliant. ""Love & Violence"" captures the behavior of a couple going through difficulties in their relationship with chilling accuracy and ""Hard Day"", does the same for the working class. This is a great CD and is enjoyable on many levels."
3,Adequate Primer,"The book is easily written to understand the grammar basics for learning French from scratch on your own. The book I assume was intended to be used in a classroom setting as some of the exercises require listening. There is no cd accompanying this book nor are there any answer keys to verify responses for written exercises. However, if you want an easy to read guide for basic grammar and vocabulary, this book is sufficient for this purpose.In conjunction with the above workbook, I would recommend buying another self-study book with an audio cd so that you can hear the pronunciation while following along the text at the same time. Most language book publishers today include a cd with the text in their current publications."
3,Almost good,This would be a very good course if not for the fact that the audio part of the program does not cover dialog part. For beginners being able to herar what the language sonds like is very important. I have used Spanish NOW by Barrons with tapes that include dialogs. What a difference!
3,Exercises are a little to easy,"This 'teaching' part of this book is clear but the exercises are often very repetitive and too easy. In some exercises, you only need to know one word of vocabulary to complete the work without applying the proper grammar"
3,Okay,"This book is okay and nothing more. It's a cheap way to introduce oneself to French; however, there are several spelling errors in it."
2,Not good for toddlers,"I bought this cd for my 17 month old to listen to during naptime. Not only is the sound quality not that great, but in the middle of the cd ther are a couple of songs with loud creshendos. Probably okay, if you or your child are not light sleepers."
3,Alan Davey - 'Chaos Deilight' (Black Widow)Italian import CD,"I'll give it 3 1/2 stars,nearly as good as his 'Bedouin' CD(see my review).Eight solid cuts of Hawkwind's second longest serving player,as the bassist was with the band between 1984-96 plus he's played on plenty of their live dates for several years now.'Chaos...' is a decent 2000 release that's all instrumental.In fact,I believe Davey plays all instruments on this effort.The tracks I liked best were ""Sci-Fi-Delic"",""Program Theme From U.F.O.""(Davey's own personal tribute to vintage sci-fi TV shows),""Eagle Alpha"" and the rocking ""Assimilation"".Overall,just a good uptempo space-head rockin' piece to get crazy to.Comes with a 12-page comic-book like CD booklet.Very nice.Hawkfans should be reasonably pleased with this title."
5,Excellent frames,"Excellent frames: unwrap, insert picture and hang, complete with glass. Couldn't be simpler. Exceptional value for the price. Delighted."
2,Disappointing,"I bought two of these frames, and I'm pretty disappointed. Yes, they do hold my pictures, but the quality of the frames leave a lot to be desired. The wood on the back is chipped, and the front is scuffed and scratched, even though they arrived in individually sealed packaging. I will look elsewhere in the future if I need a picture frame."
3,Okay Frame,"I had an antique print in an unusual size. I was happy to find a frame that would work with the piece, but was a little disappointed in the quality. The frame itself seems sturdy. It's the gold on the frame that's the problem--the gold wasn't consistent around the ridge. It looks as though it rubbed off in places. I ended up keeping the frame since it still worked with my print, but I don't know that I would recommend this to anyone looking for a perfectly gilded frame."
1,???????,"I know that this is only episode 1 but it's boring beyond belief, I just saw it under product recommendations when I bought Devil May Cry and they recommended this crap. I didn't know until after the fact that there was another series that took place before this. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I saw the series before, but to be real, I deleted it the day I watched it."
4,"True adverture book, loved it","It grabbed and held me. Africa is still an exciting place and its history is more exciting. I was there, on and off, from the 50's to the 80's and there has not been a more accurate picture painted of that period. I feel I know Gab and Jimmy."
4,More excellent Anne McCaffrey,"This book, and Dinosaur Planet Surviors are a MUST read before diving into the Planet Pirates series (Death of Sleep, Sassinak, Generation Warriors). Even though the time frame for this book is towards the end of Death of Sleep and of Sassinak, you must read these first to get the full impact of the whole set. She does such a good job of character development, that her works are never cookie-cutter. Each world is as real as the next."
3,"More dinosaurs, please","This book was enjoyable as a tale of humans (and humanoids) exploring a distant world. However, the title led me to believe that I would read a lot more about dinosaurs than I did. The romance at the center of the story is nice, though a little under-played. I would have liked more, more, more. A more intense dinosaur adventure can be found in Dinosaur Wars, by Hopp, where both the romance AND the big beasts are more well-portrayed. Still, Dinosaur Planet was worthwhile reading--just not my top preference of this sub-genre."
1,Leave it to the Dinosaurs,"It has been about a decade since I read this book, so I do not remember the details all that well, but I do remember thinking it was the most poorly written SF book I had ever read. After 10 years, I still have not read worse. It is (thankfully) quite short, and perhaps if packaged with the sequal Dinosaur Planet Survivors might together make a single weak novel. As a stand alone book, you will be annoyed by the ending, which just leaves the entire plot hanging. I was too disgusted with the writing, however, to ever read the sequel. For a book to engender such negative emotions this long after I read it I think says a lot."
2,Disappointing,"Even before I read the Death of Sleep I felt that there was something not quite right about this book and the rest of the series. I was right. In The Death of Sleep, Lunzie is the one who gives the final ""sleep' injection but this is changed here. Not consistant. Anne McCaffrey can do much better than this!"
1,you really have to like Ms caffereys writing,"this book was a total let down for me , im more into weber,steve white,eric flint,david drake ,this is good read if you like soft sifi if like that type of writing this is for you ."
5,THIS BOOK HAS AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW OF THE BIBLE,WHAT I HAVE READ OF THE COMMENTARY HAS BEEN VERY INFORMITIVE AND ILLUMINATING.
1,MATHEW HENRY ONE VOLUME COMMENTARY,"Having read Mathew Henry's multiple volume set,this was quite a dissapointment.......Thank you Anthony Brown 214-650-9606"
3,"Effective for quick-reference, but get the unabridged, if possible.","Matthew Henry is a devotional scholar - that is, his commentaries shouldn't be used for historical study or language study as much as for how the text of the Bible is applicable to the lives of Christians. That said, he might be the most prolific devotional commentator of all time.I have the original six-volume commentary in my home library, and the abridged version on Quickverse on my notebook computer, for when I'm on the road. I also have this, and it does come in handy for quick reference (I used it this week while I was waiting in the doctor's office). However, one should get the unabridged Henry to get the full thrust of his commentary. This is a good quick reference tool, but probably shouldn't take the place of uncut Henry."
4,The unabridge version,"Although it is a commentary of the 18th century, it is the best commentary...However, the unabridge version in one book (the one with three columns and hard to read) or the six volumes are better than the revised in one volume. It is obvious that if you brief a commentary it is not the original commentary. I bought the commentary in Spanish and it is not the same. For carry on purposes, this commentary is good, but for a good reference, the original ones. Nothing like the original."
5,Sturdier than it looks and really keeps tea hot,"I love the double wall glasses and bought the teapot when I saw it was available. I use the teapot and the glasses together--a great pair. I get four glasses of tea from the pot, and the last one is still at an enjoyable drinking temperature. I don't use a tea cozy, and this pot is better than any ceramic one I have used. The glass is thin and certainly looks fragile; possibly not the best thing to have in a house with small children. But I've had the glasses well over a year, and the teapot several months, with no breakage. And the teapot does sit out on my counter. Laboratory glassware is just tougher than you think--it is not lead crystal. The infuser works well also, and it is very nice to be able to stop the brewing without having to dispose immediately of the tea leaves or their container. For me, it's been worth the price."
5,Bodum Bora Doublewall Thermo,"While this tea press is kind of costly, I love the all-glass double wall feature and the stainless steal infuser. It's a perfect size for one person."
1,Too much teapot for too little return,"Huh! I got this teapot because of the promise that it would keep tea hot ""up to two hours"" as it says in the literature, but it doesn't seem to do enough better than my regular teapot to justify the cost."
4,Fun and engaging,"I originally bought this toy in order to get my 1 year old some practice in sitting for longer periods in prepapation for potty training. I did not expect that he would be so intrigued by the toy. He plays with it everyday, several times a day without prompting. The one downside is that you can not leave this chair anywhere where it does not have support for the back. The chair easily tips if weight is not distributed properly. However it was easy enough to deal with I just made room against a wall for it."
1,This toy has been RECALLED!,"This toy has been recalled! [...] It poses a strangulation hazard to children, they can be caught between the table and the seat...without proper (constant) supervision, this toy could turn deadly. Beware."
5,TOTALLY LOVE IT!!!!,"I cannot say enough about this toy - it is so great! My daughter plays with it every single day. She even learned not to stand on seats because of this toy; I kept telling her it was for sitting (not standing) and now she goes to it, sits nicely and claps her hands in approval of herself. Love the toy!"
2,Child Not Real Interested,"I bought this chair for my one year old for Christmas 2007. I thought he would really like it and while he occasionally plays with it; he has other toys that he got at the same time that he plays with a lot more. Overall, though, it's cute and fun. I think my six year old likes it more, onlly because he knows how to make the chair ""talk"". My one year old is still trying to figure this part out. He does however like to put his stuffed animals in it and he knows that when he sits down in it it ""talks"". The chair does exactly what I thought it would; I just think that I should have waited until my youngest was a little older to get it. Maybe when he's two. . .The chair does show colors, animals and numbers. The lamp changes colors each time it's pushed and the chair has two settings for learning and music which is nice."
5,His First Chair!,"We have almost the entire Laugh and Learn Collection and each time we get a toy from it I am more then impressed. This chair couldn't be any cuter! As I was buying it I was thinking ""Will my baby really like this?? It's just a chair..."" But its so much more. He is in love with the little end table. The lamp lights up to the different songs the chair sings and as you turn the pages in the story book it makes animal noises. My baby is only 7 months old and it is helping his get used to sitting upwright. It is perfect size for him too. It's really tiny so it's great for the little guys. I wouldn't recomend this for kids that are 2 1/2 and up because I don't know haow long they'll get use out of it since it's so small. This goes great with our Laugh and Learn Kitchen and Our Laugh and Learn Learning house. It's like our little guy has his own house now. lol"
3,My son loves it,"My 13 month old loves this chair. He plays with it on a daily basis. I would love to give it 5 stars across the board; however, I get a little worried when he plays with it. When he pulls up on the chair, it has turned over on him a few times. It's only if the pulls up on the part that has the lamp and book. It's sorta heavy on this side and him pulling up there makes it tumble. He hasn't gotten hurt, just a little frightened by falling backwards. Now when he goes near it, I always put my hand on the back of the chair to make sure it doesn't fall over. If they'd put a little more weight on the back of it, it would be more stable."
4,Nice Product,"I just have to start with how shocked I am at the price of this item. I mean SHOCKED. I own this, purchased from a yard sale for $5.00. Yep. $5.00. Brought it home, it looked as new as this picture does. Cleaned it for safety and set it down. My then 10 month old daughter went straight to it and sat on it. She started playing with it immediately. She has enjoyed in the several months since, very much. She finds it necessary to climb up in it, turn around and THEN sit down. But it hasn't flipped over yet. This is a great great toy if you can get for maybe $35.00 or less. I can't see paying $200.00 for this. It's great, but it isn't covered in gold. I can't believe this is the price. Still shocked."
4,Great Toy but 1 Problem :(,"My 9-month old son LOVES this toy. He likes the music and singing. Instead of sitting on the chair to make the sounds, he pushes the seat with his hands. Usually, he can play with it for 10-25 minutes at a time. One of his favorite toys. The only flaw---my son now tries to stand next to the chair. The chair tips easy if he tries to do this. Hard to explain but if you have a baby who's becoming interested in pulling themselves up and standing, have the back of the chair against your couch or something stable so it doesn't tip over. Still a great toy for my son, despite stability."
5,Brilliant historical account,"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. This is a monumental piece of writing and extremely important for anyone interested in American history particularly relating to slavery and aboltion. it really does not get any better. Anyone in the civil rights movement , activst or attorney, should get a copy of this book. Get 10 copies and pass them around. It reads like a Dumas novel and informs like an encylopedia. A masterpiece. Thank you professor Von Frank.Randy CredicoDirectorWilliam Moses Kunstler Fund For Racial Justice"
4,Anthony Burns earns 4 stars,"Looking for an exciting book that you can't put down? Anthony Burns would be a great one. A slave who has be accused for stealing and he is on trial, fighting for his life and freedom. It's a sad book because he's in jail with water once a week, food twice a day (which is raw meat, cornbread, and really just scraps of food. The end is shocking and it's a great book that I recommend reading.You will never put it down."
2,Another edition change?,"As a college professor, it upsets me when book authors and publishers change editions so frequently. There is a new editon of this book coming out (perhaps it already has). C'mon-how much about basic business has since 2001? It seems a ploy to not only charge students more money (and disallow them to buy a used edition) and force professors to change the lesson plans for the course-based on changes in a couple of chapters.The book, however, is well written and provides good examples and case studies."
2,"Priority should be teaching, not exploiting students.","Good organization and readability does not excuse publishers from using their business knowlege to stick it to students. The ""description"" here doesn't do anything to change that impression. Perhaps this book should have been called ""How to Make a Killing in Academic Book Sales"" Obviously book buying is a new hazing rite for American students. ""Yes, sir, may I have another!"""
1,truth in advertising,"I was told I would get the cd rom that comes with this book and I didn't get it. Two weeks ago I gave Katie Verhalen the opportunity to fix this problem by emailing her through this site, I got no response. I'm still waiting for what was promised: The cd that goes with the book!"
3,3 sexy popular actresses before fame--2 topless!!,"Where else can you see Kirstie Alley and Marina Sirtis topless in the same film, plus a young Valeria Golino posing in a bikini? Those are the 2 or 3 reasons to collect this film, obviously. However storywise it's definitely a unique concept: a guy goes blind so they hook an Atari chip to his brain to give him sight. Unfortunately, everything looks like Space Invaders to him. I wonder if he's now upgraded to X-box?The dvd extras are quite good, with a very comprehensive film history of the director, including some outtakes of this film which include even lengthier nudity from Kirstie during her sex scene, some of which had been trimmed for the final print."
2,Typical '80's Cheesefest,"Just finished watching this after having it for about a year or so and finally getting around to it. Well, I guess I could've waited even longer because it wasn't very good or really worth seeing at any particular time. I've seen worse so I was still able to sit through it and besides, it's loaded with typical nondescript 1980's music by unknown acts (at least here in the States, probably), bad acting, bad photography, bad special effects, bad writing and bad directing, so watching it was a kind of excercise in sadomasochistic patience. If you're a connoisseur of bad films then this one will certainly delight you."
1,A viewer got it right!,A Viewer got it right except he gave it one to many stars.Disjointed and boring. Skip this one!
4,Pretty Interesting,"I was expecting a book with numerous interior shots of the house, but was pleasantly pleased with the history of the entire estate. I found it quite interesting.There are other books with a detailed account of the house, but all the information about the grounds, village ++ really gave me great insight of what GWV's vision was."
4,Old Vinyl Record,The order was shipped very quickly and was in excellent condition for a 50 year old vinyl record.
3,Tickle Lip,"The main feature of this shirt that I was drawn to is one that is often over-looked; this gorilla has a lot of course whiskers. Although they make him look wise and powerful, they can present a problem when trying to actually wear the shirt; if the shirt moves against your body at all it tickles like crazy! This is a very ""buyer beware"" situation. I think it's fine that the gorilla is giving you a constant mustache ride all day long, but it was more than I had bargained for!"
4,Exactly as pictured.,"This shirt was a present for my brother in law who loved it. Exactly as pictured, picture seemed larger than expected. Perfect"
