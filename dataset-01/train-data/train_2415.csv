5,"It's working, but the negative reviews have me worried","I bought this heart rate monitor last winter and it absolutely changed the way I approach running and working out. I absolutely love it. It works perfectly for me, always registers and always seems to be accurate. I'm just worried about the number of reviewers that have said it just stopped working for them. It's a great entry level monitor, but if you have more money to spend, you might want to consider going with a unit that has better overall user ratings."
1,The chest strap for this is very small and itchy.,"I am a male around 5'10"" around 300lbs, I have always had a stocky build. I wanted to use this product while I exercised to make sure my heart rate stays in the range I need it to. This chest strap is very small and very uncomfortable. The arc that is preformed on the watch would be better if it were spread out more."
2,Excellent watch! (not including wristband),"This my second HR Timex watch. Is as good as the first one however after 2 years the wristband broke and I cannot find it anywhere!!And excellent watch with a very poor wristband and, so far, worst support"
2,Disappointed,1 battery change and the device was finished. Spend a little more and get a quality product.
4,No Problems,"This watch works great!! The only negative I have are the instructions. They are not the clearest I have ever seen, but if you stay persistent you can figure it out."
4,exactly what I was looking for,"This is a very concise little book, it is filled with very specific information about Egyptian models; a topic that is usually glazed over in other books. Smaller than I had anticipated but would have still purchased it, certainly a good resource, would recommend."
5,My blood pressure went down by 20 points,"I actually starting using the Dash diet and some of the supplements, not all. In a few days my blood pressure started to go down dramatically. It's amazing how much salt there is in everything. You really have to read labels and of course a lot more fruits and veggies!"
5,book review,"This book offers a wide variety of treatment options (dietary/ behavioral modification, use of various supplements) in the treatment of hypertension, as well as a comprehensive review of the prescription medications available for this condition. I found the dietary suggestions quite helpful, and this is one of the few books I have read which offers sound advice on use of dietary supplements as well as their presumed mechanism of action."
3,"Unless You Want To Be On The DASH Diet, Don't Bother With This Book","I hate reading books that provide a monopolistic answer to a problem. The issue in this case is hypertension and they recommend the so-called DASH diet with it's salt-cutting, fat-forbidding plan for supposedly getting this condition under control. And yet research out of Durham, North Carolina has shown that consuming a low-carb, high-fat diet without regarding to the salt content in the meals makes blood pressure drop like a rock naturally. Where is this information in this book? If you're gonna write a book about BP, then wouldn't it serve the public well to have ALL the information instead of just some that fits within your world view?"
2,Attractive But Design Problems,"Guess I still remember my childhood storybook cover of Aladin and the Magic Lamp so was attracted to this very stylish teapot as well as to Bodum's reputation. However, I question the stated capacity, which may only be obtained by filling all the way up to the top, including in the spout. And, as other reviewers have stated, it is impossible to fill through the center opening because the handle gets in the way no matter which way you turn your tea kettle; plus the handle ""gives"" when the filled pot is lifted,leading me to question its eventual durability. I finally solved the problem by carefully pouring the boiling water through the spout. I do agree that it brews a great cup of tea though."
2,"Looks good, makes good tea but not practical","This is great to look at but not very practical. If you need to walk any distance with it, the tea easily spills out of the spout. If you like your tea strong, the lid is too hot to get off once the tea is ready, so you can either have crazy strong tea or burn yourself. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Not fully stainless -,"This is not fully stainless steel. For the high price this should be fully stainless, not chrome plated. To me when this arrived it was so tinny and light. It seemed like it was made more of chrome versus the stainless. If you are looking for all stainless look elsewhere. Not worth the price tag!!!!"
5,Tasty French Dips,"Easy and delicious for French Dips!Thin slices of Boars Head Roast Beef, Panera Bread baguette, Minors and horseradish on the side."
5,Pricey BUT Yummy!,"Price plus shipping equals very expensive. I almost didn't order this, BUT, I did and I am so glad. I am a very picky eater and this is SO yummy! My hubby and I rarely agree on food, and he tried this, with his words being.... ""This is good."". My kids love it too. I will be a repeat customer on this product!"
3,"Beautiful Chair, but....","This chair is gorgeous. The fabric is very refined looking. BUT the workmanship detail leaves a lot to be desired. The instructions for assembly are straight forward and easy to follow and all connecting points are easy to reach for assembly, but I was missing two split washers and had a one back-to-seat assembly bolt hole that was drilled incorrectly. To save time in correcting this problem, I read the other reviews on the Target website. You will need at minimum a 1/2"" drill bit and a flashlight to correct any incorrectly drilled holes. It took me hours to get this chair assembled, as re-drilling the one incorrectly angled hole didn't solve the problem, I had to re-drill all four holes that were needed to connect the corners of the seat to the back of the chair. I don't think I would purchase a second chair, just because the assembly was such a nightmare."
1,Labor Intensive for 7 Screws!!,"We got 3 chairs and were happy with the color, It took 1 1/2 hours per chair to screw the bolts in they wereset up so that it was difficult to anchor the bolts. We didn't give up and now have 3 chairs, but I would Notbuy from this company again."
5,Great product,"Works well, great product. a bit pricey.For the price, it should have included a BNC to RCA adapter.."
3,Well-Written Yet Uncompelling,"The twenty stories here offer little variation from those in Busted Scotch. Written in the first-person, these are again mostly from a lower-class male perspective. They often feel fragmentary in nature, rarely offering up a traditional ""story"" per se, they tend to be more about how people communicate and misunderstand each other. Kelman's a good writer, but I don't find his stories particularly interesting."
2,Shortchanged,Beware - this is described as a boxed set - it isn't - it's only 2 discs. The original had 4 discs and 81 tracks and could truly be described as a box set.More Lost Treasures of Ted Heath
4,I say GREAT but with reservation,"This is a great recording of some of Ralph(pernounced ""RAFE"")Vaughn Williams best work. But it is not the best you can find. For the english folk song suite, i highly recomend the recording of Neville Marriner and Academy of St.Martins in the fields. For the Lark ascending the recording of Midori and the New York Philharmonic can't be beat. For ""O Clap your hands"" and ""O Taste and See"" this is the best recordings. Except that the Kings choir could work on the diction."
3,Okay!,This book was listed as good even though it was an old copy. I expected it to be in better shape. The jacket was torn and in bad shape. The actual book is not too bad. but more worn than I thought! Otherwise okay!
1,Not a great product,"I use a Sony RZ Pentium 4 2.80 GHz with a Linksys wireless USB link. This computer comes without a serial port that's why I had to install a Serial Port. The drivers installation were fine, and it did work (with some, not all applications) but when I turned off the computer and turned on again the system stopped recognizing the wireless USB, I restarted the system 5 times until it occured to me that it was something about the belkin port, then I unplugged and restarted and presto! the Linksys worked again, however, now even with the belkin Port unplugged I have to plug-off and plug-in the Linksys card in order to be able to access the lan. I other words, the Belkin installation spoiled my Wireless connection. Be aware that this product may conflict with some of your USB devices, and since some applications wouldn't work I would try another alternative as a PCI serial port card or a USB to Serial cable from another manufacturer."
1,Were some ingredients omitted????,Several recipes seem to have ingredients missing - such as hisbread crumb toppings. Recipes are easy to prepare but are toobasic and a little boring.
1,would have been better without the pictures,"I should have listened to the above reviewer, who was kind. Way too expensive for what is not there. I'm returning it for a basic Betty Crocker that comes with GOOD pictures."
2,Difficult to Clean,"I had a larger version of this teapot. I used it for a year or so, but replaced it with a HuesNBrews pot, primarily because the infuser on this beast is crazy hard to clean. I usually ended up forcing water through the slits with the hand sprayer on the sink and then using a bristled scrubbie to get the stuck bits. It IS pretty, but so is the HuesNBrews teapot."
3,Teapot,This is my third one of these pots. I'm not sure what causes the cracks over time but this one beats the rest. I already have a crack in the lid.Tea bags seem to brew better if you leave the insert out and just fish the bags out later.
2,Not worth the money,"First of all, this teapot is so pricey because it is mouth-blown. However, the quality does not match the price. The strainer is a piece of glass with slits cut in it to strain the water. However, the design is poorly made because the tea leaves end up blocking the passage and water does not get through. Secondly, the teapot is made of very thin and fragile glass. A simple tap against the sink will be enough to cause a chip on the infuser. And lastly, the infuser and lid are very loose fitting causing them to wiggle freely around the teapot."
2,"Nice looking pot, but way too fragile","The first pot was broken when i opened the box. I did not think anything of it, as accidents happen during shipping. So i returned it and got another one(super fast, A+ for amazon returns department). We used it for several days and were really liking it, other than it can be hard to clean depending on the size of the tea you are brewing, as the slits can get clogged. Then one day i was washing the strainer and it tipped over and shattered. I did not drop it on the floor, it simply tipped over while drying and broke. I had a feeling this would happen, because as soon as we took it out of the box i was thinking how fragile the pot looked. This would be a good pot if the glass was thicker, but as it is it is way too thin, both the pot and the strainer. I would look elsewhere for a thicker pot if you need a glass one."
1,Stirring Marches of the USA Services,"I agree with who ever wrote the following review 100%. This this CD is awful.""So much orchestral embellishment that one can't even pick out the tune you want to hear. What a mess they've made of simple powerful music."""
1,Stirring Marches of the USA,So much orchestral embellishment that one can't even pick out the tune you want to hear. What a mess they've made of simple powerful music.
2,Great marches........ Poor rendidtion,These are stirring marches but these renditions are like the score from a BAD B war movie.
4,concise,"A good book for background on characters and places. I bought this book used, but it was still in really good condition. A little brief on some things, but covers the important stuff pretty well. Has pictures of most characters and prominent objects and ships. No large pictures. Good quality paper and print."
3,Not what I had hoped for.....,"I have been dying to get an Arnold McCuller CD for a while.....ever since I saw him sing backup for James Taylor. (If you've heard his solo in Shower The People you know what I mean.) But on Exception to the Rule, Arnold never ""lets it rip"" like you hear him do live. He must have been holding back because I know he can really sing. I'm thinking about trying the Live cd to see if I really hear the ""true"" Arnold on that one. Sorry to say I wasn't impressed with this one."
4,Irwin 2082300 Utility Knife,"A very nice knife,easy to use. It fits the hand well easy to grip.Blade changes very easily. Has place for spare blades but you have to watch when you store or remove them. RFP"
4,Quality cutter,"This cutter has a nice feel and works well. The blades are very sharp and cut great (ask my thumb, ouch!). Be careful when you cut, people! A good quality cutter for the price. It would be nice to be able to access the replacement blades in the body without using a screwdriver but I think it would be hard to build a solid cutter without this design."
5,Great knife,This knife feels good in your hand and the lever to extend the blade works very smoothly without hanging up. Nice and heavy duty too. Much recommended over the Stanley contractor's knife.
5,Good rugged knife.,"This knife is a good size, and it comes with a good quality blade also. It will hold up to a lot of abuse."
3,Don't Buy From Amazon,"DO NOT buy from Amazon! It came scratched up with paint missing from both sides. I would swear it was used if it still didn't have the unenclosed packaging around it. Since it is exposed, Amazon should have stored (in their warehouse) or packed better. It looks like a USED tool when it arrives."
4,"""Proper has its time and place...""",I was up till mid-night finished this book. It was pure historical romance with splash of mystery. Miranda's is 'ruined' by a rake and is sent to the country. Jack the Rake is also sent to the country because his brother the Duke has had enough of his embarressements. The book starts nine years after the kiss/ruin. The truth comes out over time and Miranda and Jack must face the truth. If you enjoy this genre I would also check out The Lady Lies The Lady Killer and The Lady's Code by Samantha Saxon.
2,"You can keep ""This Rake""...","As another reviewer mentioned, I also bought this book because of Julia Quinn's recommendation. What a disappointment.First of all, the premise, although it had promise, was poorly drawn out. We're supposed to believe that Lord John pined all these years for a woman he shared one kiss with? And knowing that, that he didn't even recognize her when he saw her again nine years later?There was little heat between the characters (honestly, by the time they got to it, I was too irritated to care) and too many other distractions going on. The espionage story line was obvious, boring and it's been done. A lot.Save your money, stick with Julia Quinn's books and not her recommendations."
4,A Great Read For Beginning Coaches,"If you're considering becoming a volleyball coach, I'd recommend this book. There are tips on every phase of the game, from the physical skills of your players to the mental aspects of dealing with athletes under stress.When I began thinking about coaching high school ball, this was one of the books I turned to for help and advice. It helped me, and it can help you, as well."
1,Wrong Picture,Watch out. The picture does not match the product. If you buy a 09260 you will be shipped a landscape oriented binder. The picture actually matches 09261
1,Tasteless,"Once again, Cathy proves to be a repetitive bore. It's the same old thing over and over again. The only interesting section of the book is when Cathy spent a semester interning for President Clinton. Now there was a funny, well written, and even better drawn series of cartoons! If only Guisewite had done more skewering of our most misogynistic president, I might have been a bigger fan."
5,The best Civil War Audio Book on the Market,"This is the best American Civil War audio tape on the market. George C. Scott narrates, also each character that reads their historical lines have that states or countries accent. Additionally, they read their lines with passion and feeling.This starts out with the many reasons for the war, and quotes many events and details of importance.The Audio tape, has neither a ""We were right, and they were wrong"" approach, or a Northern or Southern view.It is unbiased history.If someone wanted to learn about the American Civil War, and had little knowledge, or were very knowledgeable, they will greatly enjoy this Audio book."
1,Don't Get This Version!,"The story was promising, but I spent $10 on only the first half of the novel. Imagine my surprise when I am reading the book out loud to my children only to find that the story just stops. ""End of Vol 1"" is all that was written. I downloaded the entire copy for free from iBooks on my iPad and was shocked to find that the book is supposed to have 46 chapters. This version ends at chapter 25! I am very disappointed. Not to mention that this book is horrible to read since there is hardly any punctuation and there are many typos. Take your $10 and buy a legitimate version of this story. I will never again buy one of these General-Books copies. At least on iBooks its free, so if I didn't get the whole story I wouldn't have been out any money. Lesson learned!"
2,wish I had known ahead of time,"This is a fantastic book, and I've been waiting a long time to own it. Unfortunately, this particular edition is only the first half of the book (even though it says volume 2). I can deal with the typos, lack of page breaks and chapter headings that regular publications have, but I would have enjoyed knowing that up front, along with the fact that the second half was omitted. Would not purchase a General Books publication again. I wish there was some way Amazon could have let me know these things."
2,Mistakenly Numbered Volume,"Dear Amazon Review Compilers,This ""Volume 2"" turned out to be ""Volume 1"", and there were many typos in the body of the work -- just stray characters and phrases, plus there were no apostrophes, so you had to insert them mentally as you read.After reading this volume, I ordered the complete book in a regular paperback format, and it was a great read! I enjoy Elizabeth Gaskell's writing, but not when the printing is full of pitfalls.I do not think this type of printing is in the same league as your usual standard of book.Sincerely,Victorian Literature Fan"
5,"Charming watch, well priced","The watch is of rather nice quality, with a pretty floral case. It is easy to read, and does so properly as it hangs upside down. This means that with 12 at the bottom while it hangs on the necklace, it's at the top of your view when you open it to look at it. No extra fumbling required. The chain is long enough that I can just barely slip it over my head without having to mess with the clasp."
4,"Very cute, ugly chain","The only reason I take a star from the review is that, as in other reviews is explained, the chain is very ugly, don't let that turn you off, the watch is nice and very cute is worth the price. I took the advice from reviewers changed the chain and now looks very good."
3,"Great watch, bad chain","The watch itself is great. It looks cool, and is really helping me get better at reading time. But the chain is bad. I don't think it's ugly, like some of the other users (I actually think it looks quite nice with the watch) but the gold tone rubbed off on the back of my neck! Luckily I had already purchased another gold chain, so I switched them out. It's just disappointing, because I really didn't mind the chain. So, I definitely think the watch is a good buy, but you'll want to find a new gold chain to wear with it."
3,I dislike the packaging but the product is nice,"It takes forever to get enough lotion out to condition my son's hair. I wish this product came in a tub instead. The product itself is non-greasy, penetrates quickly and does soften his hair. It doesn't add much shine though."
2,WAY CHEAPER AT SALLY'S!,"I SAW THE SAME PRODUCT TODAY FOR $8 and change at Sally's. Its a great product, but the $10+ price on here is outrageous."
5,Learn All About Mayan Hieroglyphs!,"This is a great book for introducing children and others about hieroglyphics. I thought it was great for myself even. The book tells the history of diciphering the Mayan hieroglyphs. While the Egyptian hieroglyphs had the Rosetta Stone, there was no Rosetta stone for the Mayan. Archeologists needed to learn how to count and tell time, then went from there. Very interesting."
3,An Index to Covert Activities in WW II,"William B. Breuer wrote 31 other books on military history (p.ii). He dedicates this book to General William C. Westmoreland (Ret.) who ""led freedom forces in the Vietnam War with great honor and exceptional proficiency"" (p.v). This book has 99 concise stories on covert activities that helped the Allies to win victories on the ground and in the air. Most were spies, some were soldiers caught behind the lines. These stories are grouped into five parts by the course of the war. Some were more important, others are just entertaining. The 'Notes and Sources' has references to books that cover the stories in more detail. The 'Index' has references to the many people named in these stories. They are often ""so bizarre or illogical that their telling would have been rejected by Hollywood as implausible - yet they happened"" (p.2). The 211 pages allocate about 2 pages for each story."
2,Not so great,"If you can get a used copy for .60 cents, maybe it would be worth it for a peak occasionally or just to look cool on your bookshelf. I did not feel any emotional or intellectual connection reading it. I feel certain that many of the facts are incorrect."
3,"A Fast Read, Good To Get Information","This is an OK book. It really doesn't delve with any details other than a summary of an action that took place. With 100 stories in one book, each is about 3 pages or less, so it's a good reference book to obtain names of people involved and be able to read more in depth about them elsewhere. You could go through this book in a day. I'd recommend the Skorzeny biography ""Commando Extraordinaire"" (or something like that) as a great read, he alone was in the middle of about 20 exciting missions that in one book can be dealt with some details and insight. I see his books are hard to find, I guess any Nazi is a bad person but his story is full of excitement. Hell, they are making all these revisionist stories and movies about Hitler (truly an evil man) why not make a movie about Skorzeny?"
2,Not thrilled,"This purse looked like something that I wanted, but to my dismay, the handles were way too short to carry over the shoulder. Don't bother to get this one."
4,nice bag,"Just got the bag today. I agree with the other review that this bag is not thrilled, but it's ok compared to its price. The shoulder strap is long enough for me, however, the bag is not as big as I thought. I got the black one, and it's good as an interview bag. I'm happy with it."
3,It's okay !!!,This purse appeared much larger. I am very disappointed in the size and the quality of the product. The color is great!
3,it look like fake leather.,"I thought I was going to like the brown tote as like the ""natural"" colors, I was very disappointed when I received it as the color is not a ""natural"" brown it has a funky red hue in it that makes it look like fake leather."
5,Great!,"This flashlight is a great companion to my Ridgid hammer drill. I find myself in many crawl spaces and atticks in my line of work, and the fact that the fl has a big base and can sit there while you work is great. It also has good battery life. And it's at a good price."
4,Just as described and excellent service,"The product was just as described. It's not the greatest flashlight in the world, but you're not paying a lot for it. I just wanted a flashlight compatible with my Ridgid batteries. I got exactly what I paid for. The speed at which I got it was very impressive. From the time I ordered it to the time I had it in hand was about 4 days -- and it shipped from across the country!"
3,Good And Bad,This book was very interesting but I think it could have been better. Anne Marie Winston is one of my favorite authors. But I don't think she did her best on this book. It was a littel to wordy in the begining but near the middle it got better.
3,Classic series romance,"Attention alpha male fans! If you love a gorgeous, arrogant hero who gets his comeuppance but good from a fiesty, misunderstood heroine, this one's for you. Although there's nothing new in the plotline, Ms. Winston creates strong tension between her characters and keeps it up to the very end of the book. Sexy and fast-paced. Shades of Diana Palmer and Linda Howard."
5,Great Romance,I really enjoyed this book because the relationship between them is so sweet and complicated. I have read it twice because one day I just needed cheering up and this book did that.
4,A delightful read,"Jessie wants a baby and childhood friend Ryan decides he would be the best donor. However, he wants a family so they agree to get married after she is artificially inseminated. As their fetus grows inside her, Jessie realizes she is in love but knows love is not part of the agreement. Ryan is torn by the fact he has always loved Jessie, and although he thought he could settle for having a ""part"" of her, he realizes he needs to have ALL of her.Anne Marie Winston created lovely characters that have a beautiful friendship. The story is woven nicely and as Ryan and Jessie's fetus develops, it's joyous to watch their friendship blossom into passionate love."
4,An enjoyable read.,"Anne Marie Winston created some likeable characters in this novel - especially Gray, what woman wouldn't want a man like him? The plot revolves around the fact that Gray had a heart transplant and received Catherine's deceased husband's heart. After getting to know Catherine, he is afraid to tell her about the heart transplant (for obvious reasons), which puts a thorn in their relationship. Winston also creates a very interesting twist regarding the transplant that helps us get to know Catherine through her first marriage. This was a good book & easy to breeze through."
3,too much errata,"Every time I sit down with this book I get bogged down trying to follow the examples, only to discover that there is a typo or an inconsistency between the code and the topic."
2,Definitely not for beginners,"I'm just starting to look at MDX and have a minimal background in T-SQL. This is not the book if you're in my shoes. It jumps to advanced topics much too quickly, uses terms that haven't been previously discussed, and doesn't give enough progressive examples. It just doesn't do a good job of building the basics before it starts jumping around and getting advanced."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"Very poorly written, but advanced book. Author covers wide range of topics, which are a must for anybody serious about learning MDX, but the writing style and explanations are just plain terrible. There are constant references to the topic yet to come in the subsequent chapters. Some sentences take 2-3 passes to understand. Many explanations of functions could really benefit from editor's touch (bold here, cursive there). Try to figure out the meaning of a new function when one sentence contains three words ""level"" and each one refers to something different. Be sure to read ""Fast Track to MDX"" to be sure you are ready for this one. Unfortunately this is currently the only advanced MDX book on the market."
1,Please spare yourself the trouble,Why listen to this garbage and pose? If you can't play your instrument or pretend not to then get a life and quit having pajama parties and coloring contests. This album as well as the rest of these poseur/artsy fartsies need to quit trying to fake people out and get a real job. If you like this crap then get the Shaggs and be done with it because at least they were being honest and sincere even if they couldn't play. I'd rather listen to a Steve Vai or a Poison album than this fodder any day!
5,Great little vac!,"It's adorable, whimsical and great for the little emergencies that happen every day! Its suction is so strong that it picks up coins under the chair cushions! It's a great gift for the crafter or cow-lover or teacher! I have one in the kitchen, family room, and sent one to my sitter's dorm room as a gift.Great for the car too in the child seats. I like the crevice attachment too! It'a wonderful value and makes cleaning a little more fun."
4,I love it,"It is light weight, low noise and works very good.It is one of my favorite christmas gifts this year and most needed."
5,Great fun!,I bought several of these as Christmas gifts for siblings. Everyone loved them and I have ordered two more--for me and my parents.
3,Everchanging Autumn Moods,"Using traditional and unconventional instruments in a tribal genre Amir Baghiri brings forth a well produced moody ambient project. It is difficult to achieve a desired musical effect of a particular promiced frame of mind. Tracks 3,5 & 8 are impressive pieces bringing a true autumnal essence with warm dark instrumentation and subtle colorization. The didgeridoo and twanging may be distracting, but nonetheless 'Autumn' proves its tribal ambient worth. Perplexing is track 6; a backroom industrial thumping which belongs in another collection and sounds awkward here. Baghir stands firm yet overshadowed on the field with the likes of masters Rich and Roach."
3,Editing Issues,"This book has very yummy recipes that are gluten and sugar free. So far, I haven't been disappointed with the taste or the recipes, they've all been very tastey. That being said, I have found many editing errors in this book. Places where they forget to tell you whether or not to slice mushrooms, what size pan to use and to cut your dough into triangles to make scones to name a few. Sure, most cooks can make it past these small errors, but young or inexperienced cooks could easily be confused. I find it just sloppy to have errors like this in a cookbook."
4,Pleased My Wife and Our Tastebuds,"I ordered this for my wife because of her special diet, and we were both pleased with the recipes. I've enjoyed some great desserts because of her cooking from this book. It's pretty nice being able to enjoy good tasting food without guilt.One word of advice: taste everything objectively. Some things taste and feel similar to their original unhealthy counterparts, but many taste a little different. Don't go into this looking for recipes that taste exactly like you're used to tasting. These recipes will taste a little different or have a slightly different texture. But just because something doesn't taste the same as you expected doesn't mean it doesn't taste good. Try everything with an open mind. After all, I did, and now my wife lets me try all sorts of desserts and great tasting foods!Enjoy!"
2,So-So,"I don't know why, but I expected there to be photos. Photos help so much more than words to entice the reader into either wanting or not wanting to make the dish. The number of recipes for each category is disappointing. There are only a few ideas for breakfast....come on....Yogurt and Meusli is a recipe? In short, quite disappointing."
4,Gluten Free Cooking Made Simple,"This book has been my best resource in learning how to prepare Glunten Free meals. Not only is the format easy to use, every recipe I've tried has been delicious."
4,Recipes are good,The recipes in the book are very good. My wife has fixed several of them and they are very tasty.
4,Good recipes,I like this recipe book but am not sure why they felt it necessary to add some items liked deviled eggs that don't even use flour or sugar to begin with. I expected to see only recipes that needed the substitutions from flour and sugar.
2,Not that great.,"It wasn't what I was expecting. The recipes are things my mother would have made when we ran out of flour and sugar. Also I was hoping to see more vegetarian and vegan things, there were very little to none. Kind of a giant waste of money."
5,My most used cookbook!,I just love this cookbook and have yet to cook or bake something that I did not enjoy. I have bought this book for friends and family on several occasions. Friends always request the recipe from an item when I make a salad from the book- the salads are amazing. It is a must have book if your gluten-free or watching your sugar intake.
2,cook book,Would be a great book if you knew before had you would have to buy so many differnt flours.
1,NOT THE GREATEST,This cookbook uses too many hard-to-find ingredients that you have to drive all over to find. I sent the book back to Amazon to get a refund.
2,Too many obvious recipies,"A cookbook for gluten free cooking should concentrate on foods that usually contain gluten. There are only a few recipies for breads and desserts. Main dishes, vegetables and salads seldom contain gluten or sugar anyway and this cookbook has 145 pages out of 207 of these recipies."
5,Healthy and Tasty,"Because the explanations are thorough and easy to understand, I found the recipes to be uncomplicated and simple to prepare. One of the particularly beneficial features of the book is the variety of recipes offered. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty healthy substitutions can be!I would highly recommend this book to anyone with food allergies, parents of children with food-related behavioral difficulties, or those who simply want to follow a healthy lifestyle."
2,Okay...now what??,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been said already? It was really fun at first but I got tired of it after literally, two days. I got to play several sessions of this game for free because it came with the laptop I just bought. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it because it definitely is NOT worth the money.There is only so much you can do and there are limited upgrades that you can choose for your lemonade stand. It definitely could be more interactive. After you've got your lemonade stands established, you just keep making money and tweaking recipes and then there's nothing to do after that. It gets old real quick. I would not recommend buying this product. Try borrowing it from a friend or get it some way for cheap. The game is only interesting and fun for a week tops. There are better tycoon games out there that will keep your attention for longer."
2,Very Boring Game,"This tycoon game at first was fun just to explore and see what happens. Then after a while of gameplay it just becomes very boring. You do the same thing over and over and really not as involving as other tycoon games. Gameplay is very limited. No real fun or even interesting to play because it is so limited. You buy a stand, get very few upgrades, set your stock, set your recipe and then start selling. Next day check stock and tweak recipe according to customer feedback. Once your recipe is set then everyday check the weather and add or subtract ice accordingly. Check stock of supplies and tweak ice and that is it everyday. Not a lot of options to really do much. Each type of stand has a choice of upgrades but you can only purchase a limited number and then in order to have any other upgrade you must sell one that you already purchased. I bought this game thinking it would be a great tycoon game to add to my collection but it is one that I will put away and never play again."
2,Not sturdy- lost interest,"This is an expensive toy for it not to be great. The problem with the toy is that it the creations don't stand up. This means you must have 2 people to hold the structure together as you build & then it will fall over as soon as the child starts to play with it. What good is a fort, box or airplane you can't get into? The result is crying & a quick loss of interest in the toy. You then have a huge crate of plastic pieces that you must decide what to do with. Not impressed."
1,too hard for under six year olds,I think this toy might have been really fun for a kid over six. I bought it for my preschool and it was way too hard for the kids. I was disappointed because it had said three and up on an amazon review. I saw it elsewhere (ABC school supply) listed as 5-10 on ages. Kaplan would not reinburse for shipping return (almost $20)
1,The never received book,"I ordered this book as a gift. It never arrived. I received confirmation that it had been sent, but the book never arrived."
4,I only wish.....,"I only wish I could make my house look like this! This book has quite a range of different types of Cottage decorating, everything from Swedish to Shaker to Garden. It contains many ideas that I will be trying to emulate."
3,Some Good Groovin Tunes,"Grover Washington Jr. could should play a smooth yet grooving saxaphone. This compilation features several stretched out jams such as Mister Magic, Inner City Blues, Knucklhead, and It Feels So Good.There is a good balance between smooth jazz numbers and some dancing R & B. Somehow I prefer the overlooked CD Strawberry Moon as those tunes have more focus. Nonetheless, this CD has a fine collection of songs that will please R &B and Jazz fans."
5,Good book,"I havent actually bought this item from here, but this book does deserve a great review! This book is most definently unlike any other book you'll ever read. it's so touching. It brings any and every emotion out of you in a strong way each time; Happiness, pooring down tears, anger, everything. When a book brings every emotion to the reader, you know it's a good book. This is the greatest book.Although on here, they kinda make it look like its a book you would read when you're ten... wouldn't let my young kid read this! This is a for sure a high school grade or up book. Since there are some kid unfriendly parts in it. I wouldn't be reading it as a bed time story! at least those certain parts! haha.This is one of my favorite books of all time. One that i will never forget the name of. Abd if you're reading this, BUY IT. you wont regret it one bit!"
5,Loved the misery,"I bought this book thinking that I would give it to a very, very miserable girl I know that is dating a family member of mine. I guess misery is something that she learned from her mother so I hope that the right time will present itself to give her this book. It was great and straight to the point. It's tiny little pages were full of great quotes."
5,How to be totally miserable,I really enjoyed this little book. Very quick read. John Bytheway helps you consider your outlook on life and the attitudes you may be projecting. Suggests how you can make yourself miserable with your thoughts and how to turn a negative outlook into a positive attitude.
1,Not good for recovery from sever trauma.,"A number of years ago, while grappling with the effects of SEVERE trauma in my life. I purchased the CD ""How to be completely miserable"" authored by John Bytheway. Hoping it would offer me some valuable insights. To my dismay it contained a long list of ways to ""should"" all over myself. I guess that's what happens when one tries to apply a band-aid were major surgery is required."
4,"Captures Feel of the Street, Despite some Muddy History","Marc Elliot's Down 42nd Street (Sex, Money, Culture, and Politics at the Crossoads of the World) may frustrate some history mavens looking for exact truth but will be a thrill to anyone who wants to read a book that truly captures the spirit of 42nd Street. The first part of the book is the historical buildup to the author's main playground, the years of fighting to fix the street from Lindsay to Giuliani (with a wonderful portrayal of Koch, for an added thrill) as the street moved from the Crossroads of the (Porn and Drug) World to a branch of the Disney franchise. The book does deliver the sex, money, culture, and politics of its subtitle, in very healthy doses. There are no startling revelations only many, many small thrills, much like the street itself. An enjoyable read."
2,"Fascinating Topic, Very Mediocre Book.","Although the topic automatically makes the book interesting for those interested in NYC and general American urban history, reading this underachieving work made it easy to see why I found it in the bargain bin (on 42nd Street, no less).Many factual mistakes and half-truths are apparent to the casual reader, and I shudder to think what an ""expert"" on the subject would think. Also, the proofreading is bad, with many typos, and the photographs are generally of such poor quality that they are almost useless. The writing is generally uneven as well.All of this gives the impression that this book was a rushed and lightly-treated project. I will search for a better one on the same topic."
3,Some come and some go....,"My daughter wanted this CD so bad after hearing it at my nieces house. I found it for about $3-4 so I say it was worth every penny because after the newness wore off, it hasn't been played. Although I think she has severalk songs on her Ipod. I would definitely look to get used copies of music --- it comes and goes like the wind ... especially for kids."
2,Used product - sold as new.,"Item received was in a previously opened package. Fine scratches on the s/s shaft, and the top screw was stripped. Not happy about this!!!!"
3,Okay!!,This book was okay! The story was okay a bit dramatic. I would have liked to see the author build up the relationship between Jon and Samone a little more... All of the emotion between Max and Samone was a litte over done for me personally.. I will try a few of the author's other books before making final decision about her writing...
3,It was alright,"I liked Hodges' book very much. It should have been longer b/c you didn't really know why some of the chracters were so selfish. At first I thought Samone was selfish in her actions but she really did open her heart to Jon. I didn't like how she, like many of us, tried to deny her attraction to Jon. It was a good but the ending left a lot of thins open."
2,What was the Deal in this book?,"How in the world do you explain investing 4 years of your life with someone and just because they are not ready to cross the line of marriage when you want them to, you get spiteful and go and have an abortion. How is it that you are so ungrateful to the fact that even though you are not married, Max is totally devoted to her, caters to her every whim, faithful to her, and she still isn't satisfied. How do you justify Max being dumped by Samone and not trying to fight for her after all of this time, and not confronting her regarding the pregnancy that was there until the day she goes to the abortion clinic. No man wants to see his unborn child be aborted regardless of the motives. It seems to me that these two people gave up on fighting for their relationship. In comes Jon and all of a sudden Samone can now find true love. She seems to have turned it on and off, just like water. I didn't enjoy this book nor did I care for the way she made Max seem weak."
2,Unbelieveable,I never thought a woman could be so catch up on color. Samone was really something with her remarks. If I was Jon I would have told her where to go and when. But I know that is not the way the story was to be. Otherwise I enjoyed it.
2,Character Development Is A Problem,"This novel about interracial love has the same problems I see in other novels on the subject: the black man is all bad and the white guy is all good. The same is true for novels featuring a black man/white woman: there's an evil black woman and the white girl is a saint (see Eric Jerome Dickey's ""Milk in my Coffee"").In this novel, I have no idea what motives Max's behavior. And Jon is nice, but what else? The fact that he is nice and white contributes little to this story. I guess we can't have a black woman falling in love with a flawed white man, can we?I'm hoping to read a better interracial love story someday."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I couldn't wait to read this book, wish I had. The characters were not believable. I have never introduced a boyfriend as my ""lover"", I'm still puzzled by that one. If you have read Sandra Kitt's The Color of Love or Close Encounters, you are going to want to skip this one, it doesn't compare."
2,This book was just O.K.,"I didn't like the main female character in this book very much. She came off as selfish and self-absorbed. It was all about her and I'm surprised the main male character didn't leave her in the 5th or 6th chapter. She had no positive characteristics. She treated the main male character very bad. She was so vain, I'm surprised she had the strength to hold her own head up! She was so totally superficial that I found myself wishing I would ""meet her on the street,"" so I could put some sense into her. The book was just O.K. and certainly NOT a book I would read again."
3,All Woman,"I'm a bit surprised at the previous reviews labeling Samone as selfish. Come on ladies, if you've been with a guy four years wouldn't you be seeking a ring any day? And as far as abortion goes then every woman who undergoes one should be considered selfish. I can't fault Samone for not wanting to have a baby with a man who didn't love her. If anything, Max was the selfish one. Samone just needed a self-esteem boost is all. And yes, she strung Jon along but I can understand with interracial dating being new to her. She wanted him but wanted to tread carefully. I'm a little bit disappointed all in all because I thought this book would give a more in-depth look at Max and Samone's relationship. (I read a New Day first). I personally think the sequel is much better."
2,convoluted,"If you jast have to read something, you won't feel like you've lost any brain cells on this book. If you have something else to read, read it. Most of the the negative comments on the book are dead on. samone is selfish, Max is selfish, Jon is a sucker.When was this story set? I figured because it was published in 1998, it was set then or at least around the mid to late 90's. If that's the case, a lot of things don't add up. Reminiscing about Samone's youth didn't made her appear older than what she should have been.I, also, found it unbelievable that she would be with a white man. The idea that she wanted Jon the take responsibility for Yusef Hawkins death and racism was assinine. I believe most men, black or white, would have walked away from her due her all-around bad attitude and her hot and cold mood swings.Without giving away too much of the story, I would say it's not worth buying. New or used."
2,What's love got to do with it?,That's how I felt about this book. There was no love involved between any of the characters. It was more of an obsession and lust than the need to love and be loved. I felt that Samone was lacking as a character. The author concentrated more on complicating the plot rather than develop the characters mindset. I was greatly disappointed in this book.
2,A WASTE OF MONEY!,"This lady (the author),whoever she is, did such a poor job on this ""book"". Stuff in this book was so unrealistic, such as the fact that she introduced Jon as her lover, you don't go up to your friends and say ""Hi, this is (fill-in-the-blank) my lover.""! That's only a little pea in the pod, so much other stuff bothered me about this book, especially the whole abortion deal. Basically, just save your money, instead purchase Color of Love by Sandra Kitt."
1,NOT SO COLLECTIBLE,I bought this thinking that these would be beautiful postcards worthy of being collectible. NOT the case at all. Though the outer packaging is nice the postcards themselves look like someone has printed them on a low quality ink jet printer not what you would expect from a publishing company. So if you are looking for beautiful vintage soap lables I suggest you look elsewhere.
4,led bike light,works great and seems to last along time. they even supply extra batteries. would recommend to anyone
5,Excellent family activity book,"This is a really well written and beautifully designed book. Each of the activities is genuinely fun and kid-pleasing, and not something you've seen printed over and over again in parenting and women's magazines. Even the categories of games are fun: e.g., waiting room games, hairdresser games, bus stop games, waiting-in-line games. The author put a lot of thought into this handy, purse-sized activity book and it shows. This is the best family activity book I've found yet."
5,"A music fan from Aberdeen, WA","I have a copy of this on album. Neither ""Is There Something I Should Know"" nor ""To the Shore"" included. Instead, a six minute, twenty second version of ""Planet Earth"" is included as the first song. I'm not sure I would say it's my favorite, being that I also like ""Rio"", and ""Seven and the Ragged Tiger a lot. But I give it five stars anyway."
3,A good album.,"I've admired Duran Duran for many years. I've always been impressed with their longevity. I am a fan of their earlier material. This debut album isn't great, but it's still listenable and sports some good tunes. I don't listen to it much now, but I gave it quite a few listens when I got it a while back. My favorite songs are ""Planet Earth,"" ""Tel Aviv,"" and ""Is there Something I Should Know?"" ""Night Boat"" has a cool intro too. This is a pretty good release. Duran Duran sounded a bit rawer on here compared to their subsequent releases. This is worth a listen."
5,The One That Started it All...,"Here is the debut album by Duran Duran. Released in 1981, it spawned the UK hits ""Planet Earth,"" ""Careless Memories,"" and ""Girls on Film."" This album didn't quite break sales records in England, but it would pave the way for band's success in America, where it blasted into the Top Ten two years later. Chart success aside, this is one fine album from one of my favorite groups of the 1980s. Duran Duran always viewed themselves as a hybird of Chic and the New York Dolls (with shades of Bowie), and that shows. Even after all these years, ""Girls on Film"" has lost none of its luster as a stomping disco jam; the beautiful ""Anyone out There"" still shines and ""Sound of Thunder"" has also aged well. The American version has the 1983 single ""Is There Something I Should Know,"" replacing ""To the Shore,"" which appeared on the original UK edition. But no matter which version you buy, you will be pleased with this release."
1,Did people really like this stuff?????,"I remember how big they were, with their flashy clothes, hair etc. I remember Hearing their songs in clubs and the radio. (I also remember how fat Simon got.) But these songs are sooooooooo dated now. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Lets hope they do not reform and tour like every other 80's band....I would rather see Flock of seagulls !!!"
5,Daughter loved it,"My daughter does not like ""kiddie"" dinosaurs - she want's the real deal and she got it with this coloring book. Excellent!!!"
4,daughter loves it,"my 2+ year old daughter loves hi-5, so it was a hit with her. i didn't realize there was a christmas song on it though. i love holiday music, but only at the holidays, so that's a little annoying. otherwise entertaining."
4,Very Educated,"My child is 16 months and he likes Hi5, it's the only tv show keeps him calm. I strongly recommended."
4,Another hit by Hi-5,"My kids (2 and 4) wake up in the morning yelling Hi-5 so this is a nice addition to their obsession ... I mean collection. They love Hi-5 and the lessons are good. If your kid loves music and dancing, this should be a hit."
5,Great!,My son has worn this dvd out from watching it sooo many times....lol. He loves it. It is educational and fun all wrapped up in one.
5,It's amazing,"I bought this one for my 1-yr and 8 months old boy. He just love this one so much from the first second when I played it on the TV.He watches it at least once per day and so concentrate on it(I limit the time as short as possible due to the potential harm of the TV to baby's sight), but I have to appreciate this DVD, because I will be free when it's playing......"
1,Arrived non-functional.,"Sounded like a cute gift. Unfortunately, the product arrived mostly un-working. The sound was unintelligble, the dancing never happened, and fortunately it shut itself off before the noise it made caused head aches. I've had other dancing hamsters in the past that have been great fun. This one sucked."
3,chrome = grey plastic,"chrome...actually grey plastic! and not very high quality plastic. good setup I guess, a bit of heat but thats to be expected. if these are relatively hidden they will work out for the low price. odd power supply setup - they are basically just plugs with extension cords to a built in three way switch."
4,Much Needed Book,"I have to disagree with the other reviewer who took issue with the emphasis on grapes over regions. The wine growing regions of Italy, let alone regions of most famous wine growing countries, have been covered in countless books. What has not been adequately covered are the less well know grapes used in these famous countries, that for whatever reasons are not available in the US or even known about. This book serves the vast appetite of more experienced wine lovers who know of the regions and now want to focus on the grapes thay make unique wines. As a lover of Italian wines, I am dismayed by the small choice in US wine shops of wines from this country. A book that educates people about grapes over regions will cause people to demand wines of particular grapes currently not available in the US - thus increasing production and sales of fruit native to these countries that have been dismissed in lieu of more mainstream choices."
2,"Should be called ""Grapes of Italy""","I was disappointed with this book. I thought it was an educational book about the wine regions of Italy, but it is actually more like an encyclopedia of Italian wine grapes. Instead of approaching the study of Italian wines on a regional level (the preferred method), the author chose to look at it grape by grape. In a VERY large font (I guess they wanted the book to look big), the author provides information about all of the major grape varieties in Italy in alphabetical order. If this is what you want then please buy this book - it does have good descriptions and pictures. If you would prefer to learn about the amazing wine regions of Italy, and the relationship between the wine, food, history, and culture of each region, then look elsewhere."
5,Excellent CD by a one-of-a-kind artist.,"If you think this CD is good, you should see him live. I live in Lethbridge, Alberta and saw him play here in a club in March. As good as the CD version of 'Goodnight Irene' is, his live version was 10 times better. Just watching how he plays the guitar is as entertaining as the music. I saw his wife plug a DAT machine into the mixing board, so I hope this means a live CD is coming soon."
3,.,"this guy's definitely a good guitarist, actually really good. i wish i could play like him. maybe i'm not crazy about the album because his vocals aren't so good. they sound sorta dumb. some of the lyrics aren't very good. but it is enjoyable to hear him play the guitar so well."
4,Love all of her books,"I've read several of her books and have loved all of them. This novel isn't perfect, there were times where it was hard to like or identify with Daisy. But what Mattison always does best for me is create complex women. You might not like Daisy but you keep coming back to find out what she'll do next, and hope that she evolves. I also appreciate that she portrays female friendships realisticly and without stereotypes."
2,A Little Too Strange,"Having read Alice Mattison's ""Book Borrower,"" I expected more from this book, especially after reading editorial reviews about it. I know there was all kinds of symbolism in this book, and it wasn't that hard to get, but mostly I just didn't care enough about any of the characters, except maybe the husband Pekko. Mostly I just thought it was kind of silly, with not much to redeem it."
1,cracks easily,"I take excellent care of my kitchen tools and sadly these Batali wooden utensils are more show than tool.After about a month of casual use, this spoon developed a crack down the center of the bowl that just kept getting worse. It became a hiding place for bacteria and we had to throw it away. I have two others from this line that have not held up, too.I hand wash these and they've never been left to soak. I have other wooden tools that have lasted 30+ years."
1,Cracked after few uses,"I was gifted this spoon and was initially impressed by its sturdy carving, but disappointed by a few rough spots in the spoon and on the handle. I oiled before using but noticed small cracks in the top edge after only 3 or 4 uses. I have since oiled almost every other day and this spoon still dries out easily and the cracks are growing. I don't think it will last much longer.This is a very loose grain wood, I would recommend looking for a heavier spoon with tighter grain. I would not buy this or other Batali wooden utensils, but will still eat at his restaraunts."
5,Food For The Soul...,"Meredith's book has arrived in my life at a time when I am exploring what it means to live an undivided life, to move out of Thomas Merton's 'hidden wholeness'. Each chapter is a portal through which my body, mind and spirit pass only to discover new meanings, insights and questions as a man seeking to live in alignment with who I am in the world. Reading a chapter before bedtime is food for the dreams of my soul, and I am grateful for Meredith's shared wisdom."
5,A book this world needs!,"As an American who lives in the Middle East, I crack a hopeful smile. If more people were to read the stories and ideas Ms. Jordan puts forth, perhaps our world, even the region in which I live, would be a more peaceful place."
2,non-stick coating is wearing off,"I bought a set approx. a year and a half ago. The non-stick coating is wearing off of 2 pans that i use regularly. This is not the best out there,but what is the best in todays world???"
2,Quatre Vingt Treize,The book shipped quickly but it was VERY old and it was an abridged edition. Nowhere said that this wasn't the whole version of the book so i had to buy another copy to get th full book. This was not good
5,"Wonderful lure, not a bargain at $999.99","The torpedo is my favorite surface lure. Just cast near to shore or structure, wait a few seconds, twitch your rod tip and expect action. WAM! I'm sorry but as much as I like the torpedo, I've got to say that, even with the FREE Super Saver Shipping option, at $999.99 this is just not a good buy. I know this sounds harsh, but think about what you could get for the same money: A pretty decent canoe. A usable, but old, boat motor and trailer. A really special rod, real, and tackle box, a bushel of burgers from the value menu. So, be wise, go for the $4.05 model torpedo. This is good old fisherman Bob, always lookin' out for you."
5,Best Blues You'll Ever Hear!,"I heard Will solo on a demo tape a few years ago and couldn't get the songs out of my head. Now, with his second release (and first with his band), I am even more amazed at his talent. I can't believe they're not signed to a major label! I mean, they make great rocking music without the addictions common to this genre. I love the CD. I love them live. They are a band not to be missed."
5,You sure they didn't play the studio tracks to the audience?,"Wow! I purchased this album after I listened to Will Derryberry's ""Learning Your Sky"" album and let me tell you....the Will Derryberry Band is great live as well. Listening to the album from beginning to end was like having them there in your own home. The audio is very clear, crisp and each song has alot of depth not only in the instrumental playing and harmonies but what is being said as well. You can hear the enthusiasm this band has for the songs they sing. They sing with pride and with a positive message. I highly recommend this blues/pop band. If you like Eric Clapton and B.B. King, you'll like the Will Derryberry Band as well."
4,Made in USA!,It's been a couple of months. The silicone blades is not too hard or not too soft. The handles are comfortable.
4,A quality product,"I didn't know exactly what I was receiving. All I knew was that my mother wanted silicone spatulas and when she received these, she was very happy! Job well done! Delivery and communication was outstanding."
5,Relevant History,"This book is a must for anyone interested in the part Intelligence plays in the history ofour country- and its ramifications in the rest of the world . It is well researched, factual,and presented to the readers clearly. Not only does it throw light on the importance of thework done by the OSS during WW2, but lessons can be learned about the present time, especiallyabout the relationship between the different branches of our Intelligence System , as wellas that of Great Britain's . It is a great reference book, as well as a challenging one.The roles played by the different heads of the Intelligence Agencies , even to pettycompeting among them, are quite interesting - and give much food for thought. Recommendedreading , easy but revealing ."
3,interesting read,"Although I believe most of the info within is factual, I also believe the author has a political agenda. Makes me wonder whats been left out. No shortage of detail. Still a good read."
4,Encyclopedia of Roses,Beautiful pictures! A lot of information which was very well organized. I can't wait to put all this info to use in my garden!
5,Great Book for Nature Loving Kids,"This book is very versatile in its use. This book can be used as a stand alone book or one that can be taken out into the field and used as a the book was intended. It, also, has great details on how to go about creating your square, safety issues, and what you might discover. For such a small book, it covered all of the seasons.I think all kids should be drawing as much as possible and this book will suggest that kids draw what they find.It doesn't try to be a field guide, but it shows many living things in outline. This can be very helpful especially out in field when you don't want to try to carry 4 or 5 books with you.All in all, I think this book would be a great book for any kid that wants to learn more about the outdoors, whether from their chair or outside."
4,A delightful collection for twin fiddles,"This is a 144-page beginning-intermediate book and CD companion set. It's a collection of 92 delightful folk melodies from Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Moldavia, Transylvania, Czechoslovakia, Moldavia, Serbia, Croatia and more, arranged for two violins in the first position with accompaniment chords. This package includes the recording, a 72-minute stereo CD presenting a performance-tempo rendition of all 92 duets from the book. Each violin is isolated on its own channel, so by adjusting the balance of your player to the left or right you can play along with the first part, second part,or both. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now)"
4,Unexpected Treat,"Aaron Copland, in his ""What to Listen For in Music"", recommended that we hear Gesualdo's ""Madrigaux"", and so I bought it. The performance and the recording are technically flawless. The music itself has diverse tempos and styles, such as the lamenting ""Non t'amo..."" and the harp instrumental ""Canzon francese..."". This is grand and very comfortable music. We easily converse or work while it plays, as charming as a court musician in the next room. It is an unexpected treat."
1,Never buy this product!,It worked great but only for 2 weeeks and now I stopped working completely. Everything lost. Never again will I buy company's products.
2,Stopped working,"I had this for a year or so.. Then it stopped being seen by my computer and stopped having that light on it that indicates that it is on. I tried on other computers, but there is nothing to do.. It doesn't want to work. Other than this, it is just an average USB drive, nothing special about it. Memory capacity is a bit low. But the fact that it stops working should make you think twice before buying it, it's not fun at all losing the data."
3,Fish Disease Book,"While this book was very detailed in the descriptions of the diseases, most of the diagnoses seemed to depend on autopsy of the victim after death. It also seemed that a microscope would be required to get full use from the book. I am not sorry that I bought the book, but I would not recommend it to most people looking for a reference on curing sick tropical fish."
4,Handbook of Fish Disease,"The book is very good for fish diseases, but the emphasis is on fish and not tropical fish. If you want a book for treating tropical fish diseases, this is not the book. If you need to know how what to do for a sick flounder this or bass, this may be one of the best available."
4,Rodney Mullen!,"Good Skate vid. Skating is good from Jayme Fortune. Gershon has a good part. Chet Thomas has some amazing hardflips. Danny Gonzalez has fun on his board with tricks you won't normally see in a video. Mumford grinds a lot. Same with Chad Fernandez. Rodney has the best part with amazing skating. I don't know how he lands some of his tricks. Definately worth buying for the Rodney part. Some extras with a nice Am montage showing some kids riding globes like Wilt, Lutzka, Ramondetta, DJ chavez. its fun to see where the kids ended up nowdays."
2,interesting Fiction,"Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining. But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work. Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses."
3,Solaris Solutions for System Administrators : Time Saving Ti,"I am relatively new to UNIX administration so I found this book useful as it is an easy read. I already have a few heavy hitting books but I was looking for a compliment to my ever growing library. It gave me a ""little of a lot"" and that does help me. I don't always want or need super detail (and you can't always cover every persons needs in detail in one book) as sometimes a simple push in the right direction will suffice. I really enjoyed the Exploiting Jumpstart chapter 6 and the Automating Everything...Well Almost! chapter 11."
3,Warning!!!! Written for Solaris 7 or earlier?,"Good ideas but very dated. Checked the Wiley web site, this site, and everywhere I could to figure out which version of Solaris this book covers. Seems to be Solaris 7 or earlier.Would be nice to see an updated edition (Solaris 8/9) of this book. If it is updated, the synopsis should state which version(s) of Solaris the book references."
4,Large and loveable,"I was disappointed when I first got this item out of the box, thinking it didn't really look like a pug. However, when my pug walked over and sat beside it, I could see it was a much better likeness than I initially thought. The only thing I can say is that it is MUCH larger than life."
2,Decieving...,"I was looking for a lifelike pug. The ad for this toy said life size, and plush. When it came in the mail, I was surprised!! The pug toy is BIGGER than a real pug. Yes, BIGGER! And the plush part is semi-true... the legs have metal rods in them to keep the toy up right. I felt a little dismayed at the false advertisement for this toy. Firstly, i don't think anyone really wants a stuffed toy that could eat (figuratively) the child's real dog. And secondly, there is limited movement for a ""plush"" toy. When i see the word plush, i think of a soft, cuddly toy that a child can enjoy... not a lawn ornament with fabric on it. The only reason this toy is online, is to fool people into buying it because it would never sell in a store where you can see, and touch it before buying it."
1,Pug we got doesn't match catalog picture; off-putting,"I ordered this pug for my wife for Valentine's day who is a pug fan but has no real pug of her own. Based upon the catalog image and description it looked like a sure thing.Unfortunately, what we got instead was an oversized (18 inches tall; real pugs rarely stand taller than 11 inches) wire-stiff bear-like animal with an off-putting wide-eyed expression that my wife and family describe as ""demonic."" Not endearing at all. Again, nothing like the catalog picture. Instead of being a cuddly addition to our household, our Melissa & Doug Life-Like and Lovable Plush Pug Dog has become the butt of jokes, destined for a charity pickup (if they'll take it)."
3,Its ok.,Its ok but not as well made ......the body is over stuffed and the face is not as real as I thought...my son likes it but for me...not worth the money....Get the boxer.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I had an older credit card file, but it started to fall apart so I needed to get a new one. I had bought the old file at Lillian Vernon and had it for years.While looking on Amazon, I found this and decided to buy as the review was good and it was inexpensive and suited my needs.When I got it, the plastic inserts inside were torn and it was very cheap and inflexible. I called Amazon and they promised to send me a replacment, but I will say I am not pleased with this item.I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. Spend a little more and get an item of better quality!"
2,Speaky English ?!?,"I bought this book a while ago after reading a few of the commentaries and then thinking it's a great book. The seals of Moses themselves are good but the information in this book does not seem to be written in a way for a normal human being to understand how the heck to correctly implement it.From what I learned, the seals in the beginning of the book are good and then after that, the rest of the stuff is more or less useless or more difficult to figure out.Fortunately, I had talked to someone who had actually used these seals correctly before and they elaborated on some of the things for me.But if I was to try to do it correctly just by reading this book, that's NOT going to happen!At least I can finally figure some of the things in this book out to add to my magick knowledge - after much difficulty."
1,PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE TO PURCHASE THIS BOOK,"This book has ruined lives. If you do purchase this book YOU MUST FINISH READING ALL OF IT. If you read it you can't stop in the middle of it. For instance you may experience great trajedys in your life; a friend might die, family harmed, car crashes and such. These are all things that have been experienced by people who don't take this book seriosly. I worry for your life, you just don't know what your in for..."
5,Do yourself a favor!,"Sonny is my piano teacher and so I am obviously biased, but hearing him on the CD is only second to hearing him in person. His phrasing and dynamics are wonderful. Enjoy!"
4,Great Punk Rock Sampler!!!,This CD is a bargain at this price. There are some awesome tunes on this disk.
5,Two richly textured fantasy worlds in one book.,"""Companions of the Road"" and ""The Winter Players"" are two quite different but superbly crafted fantasy novelettes. Both feature sympathetic characters and compelling stories, and the endings of both are satisfying and not easily predictable. I particularly liked the twist at the end of ""The Winter Players.&quot"
1,Side-effects/horrible migraines,"After using the Light Bright Visor for about 7 days I had a horrid migraine. I didn't realize though, that this was the cause. I stopped using the visor for a few days, then started it up again. After another few days I had another severe migraine. I finally figured out what was going on. I also had symptoms of dryness in my body, my vision seemed worse, mild naseau, a very strange feeling that is hard to describe but a strange unpleasant feeling in my head. I do have a history of migraines so I now realize I should not have been using this product. I have used a light box in the past and got very good benefits from it. I would say that if you have migraines I would be cautious about using this product. Otherwise, I'm sure it will be helpful to many people."
1,A Literary Abortion,"This pretentious work of incomprehensible page fodder was unfortunately forced upon me as a student of International Relations. Christopher Hill's book reads like one excrutiatingly long sentence, and is really really boring. Hill delights in tossing around ridiculously obscure foreign nonsense, e.g. ""pacta sunt servanda"" without any reasoning or explaination whatsoever. This book should really be sold conjointly with French, German, and Latin dictionaries. The author seems more concerned with impressing his snobby academic cohorts than with actually informing the reader. ""The Changing Politics of Foreign Policy"" is a cheap and narcissistic ego rampage. This rubbish should neither be read, nor recommended to students of IR intent on learning anything about anything. If you are Christopher Hill, and you are reading this right now: I hate you. If I could give this book 0 stars I would."
1,The Rantings of a would-be union leader-strictly sour grapes,Lieberman offers little that is new. So what if the unions pay their staffs generously-they are still earning far less than the hired guns that management uses to fight the unions. Of course the unions have more staff than political parties-so does McDonalds-This book is nothing but an anti labor diatribe by a man who failed in his attempts to lead one of the teacher unions.
1,Purely Political hatchet job,"Anyone who can claim to write a book on the teacher's unions and ignore the many decades of their fighting for students' and teachers' benefit is clearly only on a political hatchet mission and the truth be damned. So if your mind is already made up and you don't want reality to intrude on your pre-conceived ideas, buy this book- you'll love it."
5,Wonderful Product,"Got this griddle for christmas '03. It is a wonderful product! Do not know how I got along without it. Great for eggs (any variety, omelette to scrambled) to pancakes. Also, it is much easier for my 5 year daughter to use (with supervision of course) to make pancakes. Clean up is as easy as running water, little dishsoap and wiping down. Am online now purchasing more T-Fal products (goodbye old pans!)."
5,Best Utility Knife Period!,"This is a very durable knife that I have abused for years. Most of the paint is wore off, but it still works as good as the day I bought it. Im glad Amazon still carries it because I have not seen this model in the stores for a few years. No other brand comes even close; I particularly wish Irwin would make all of their products as good as this knife."
2,Save Your Money,"This book is just below mediocre in what it provides anyone who would open its covers. I have played AOE I and II a lot, and this book contributed nothing to my knowledge. I was hoping for the simplest of things: A complete listing of each Unit with its statistics, and instead got a first-grade primer on how to play a RTS game. Usually these lists of statistics on the units come in the games Microsoft puts out, but not from LucasArts. I would wait until a better book comes out instead of buying this complete ....... It is a part of the ""manual"" which should have been included in the game box, especially since the standard manual is lame, too. This support aspect of this game is the worst I have seen come from almost any gaming situation, and a rich company like LucasArts shows its disdain for consumers and gamers alike by packaging this ...... like this...."
1,This is a hate publication authored by a well known industrialist filled with ignorance.,"I ordered this publication as a companion to 'Henry Ford and the Jews'. I had limited knowledge about Ford's life and times outside of his obvious early success in mass production (the Model T).This specific item is a reprint of the articles Ford wrote for his newspaper, The Dearborn Independent circa 1919-1920.It is difficult to understand how a person with his management and innovation skills could adopt and promulgate such hate-filled teachings. Neil Baldwin's 'Henry Ford and the Jews' covers Ford's life and times - including the initiation, growth, and demise of Ford's Dearborn Independent. There is no need to order this item."
1,American Antisemitism at its Most Vile,"This book is valuable only as a historical artifact. It's psuedo-intellectual ramblings made it a favorite of the rising Nazis in the 1920s and 30s. It is factually inaccurate, based in large measure on the fraudulent ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion."" Ford's family viewed the book as evidence of their patriarch's impending mental collapse, and went to extraordinary lengths to disavow Henry's beliefs. To this day, the Ford Company and Ford Family are embarrassed by this screed."
1,Propaganda used by Hitler,"It is a fact that this book was used by Hitler in his propaganda campaign against the Jewish people. Hitler also quoted from ""International Jew"" in his book, ""Mein Kampf,"" which was written four years later in 1924. It is only worth having for historical proof of the Nazi propaganda filth."
1,If this book is the truth...pigs can fly,"How can you say this book is the truth and not just a load of anti-semetic rhetoric? Henry Ford was a naive racist, even going as far as to meet with Hitler. This is not insight, it is the product of hate and fear. It is poorly written, and although historicly concise, it is not veracious to the least extent. Anyone saying this book is insight needs to look up the word, and (s)he needs to read about the true beliefs and attitudes of Henry Ford, Sr. Note: the Ford motor company is extremely embarassed about this work."
1,One of the Worst Works ever written,"The International Jew is a compilation of articles that Henry Ford wrote over his lifetime. I have found it to be extremely offensive, anti-Jewish, and racist. It is a book that retains no educational value and demonstrates hatred. As a Muslim I find that these types of books are not useful and instead detrimental to the human mind."
3,one and four,I recieved the fourth in this series as a gift and liked it immensly. I then bought one because of the enjoyment I had playing Jewel Quest Heritage. It is ok but not nearly as good as four. I also bought 2 and 3 so I hope when I start them they are more like 4. The story and backround pictures are much better in Heritage. I guess they learned as they went along.
4,Fun,It's a lot of fun and it's nice you can trade lives when you fail level a few times. Some of the puzzles are really tough to get right!
4,Addictive and entertaining,"I first played this game on a trial basis through a game site and realized that I had to get the full version. I am glad that I did. There are a lot of different boards to play and each board becomes a bit more difficult. The good thing about this game is that if you're unable to beat the board, it eventually allows you to ""give up one life"" and move on to the next board. It has 5 levels of play and as I am still on the first level I assume it gets increasingly difficult in time. It's a great variation on Bejeweled but recommend it more for adults than kids younger than 10. It's very addictive and find myself playing for hours if I don't tear myself away from it. This is a great gift!"
4,Erudite and original,"I am currently working down my ToBeRead-pile and came to this book which I had picked up years ago. The unprepossessing cover had put me off until now. Well, the book was a very pleasant surprise. The narrator/protagonist and his unconventional family are rather eccentric and endearing, but highly cultured and intelligent - this is one author who does not underestimate his readers. There is humor and irony, particularly in the ultimate fate of the villain. As a mystery it is old-fashioned but in a good way. For instance, none of the crimes are psychologically harrowing for the reader, there is not too much gore; the puzzle remains firmly at the forefront. I am glad to have one of the sequels still in the pile and plan to tackle it soon."
2,Harness,Not sure about this product as our little guy could easily get out of it. We went back to a leash and collar until he is big enough for the more secure harness. THIS HARNESS IS TOO EASY FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF.
3,This was worth purchasing,This book has been helpful in answering my questions and giving many treatment options both conventional and alternative for me to try to alievate my pain. I have not finished it as of yet but return to it as I have questions and concerns. I would recommend this book it is a good resource.
1,"Beautiful, if you don't need water through it.","I bought one of these in Ultra Steel for over $300 for a kitchen remodel. It was B-U-tiful. Almost took my breath away when I opened the box. The lines and the finish both were just spectacular. Had it professionally installed...and it DIDN""T WORK. Something defective inside. I had to send it back and buy a big box special--at about a third of the price--that works like a charm. This faucet is a work of art. It just doesn't function as a faucet with water running through it."
2,Caution when buying faucets,"Bought 2 jado faucets. Both had black specks on there bronze finish, came to agreement with seller on this issue. However, side sprays both leaked in same location. Had to purchase 2 more new from a auth dealer here in my state at a cost of 125.00 each. I bought the two faucets early in my new home construction process. Seller gave reason that had purchased to long ago and didnt offer resolving the side spray problems with giving me new ones. Its not like u can use the faucet without the sidespray and u already hv nice holes drilled out in ur granite.Guess u should not buy if u dont plan on installing quickly."
2,Not worth the trip,"When I first picked up this book and read the synopsis, my interest was piqued. However, many days later, I feel as though I was robbed of something. This book seemed along the same track as Esau: something that no one knows anything about, and yet the author attempts to write a cohesive novel about it. Crichton does it so much better in his Jurassic Park novels and Congo. My main problem was that when Popescu put Ken in the savanna with Long Toes, the story suffered because of the lack of dialogue. The only truly interesting character was Cyril, and his descent into evil seems rather rushed. My advice: leave this book be."
1,Waste of time.....,"..waste of money. The author spends far too much time on the social intercourse between the main character and the pre-historic boy. It lacks a deep plot and there is no danger of one staying awake all night reading, as the thrills and adventures are mediocre, at best. The auhtor's attempt to make Ken (the main character) a modern day Tarzan, fails miserably."
2,Poopie on Popescu!,"I was so excited about this book! I could not wait to finish what I was reading and get to this! It has been 9 months since I bought it. I've approached it numerous times, tried to get into it, but I can't. I want to know, SHOULD I KEEP GOING? AND, IF SO, WHY??? QUEL BORE!!!""Neanderthal"", ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" and ""Lie Down With Lions"" are tons better and maintain one's interest throughout. With Almost Adam, go see the movie. Oh that's right. THERE ISN'T ONE!!!"
1,What was he smokin'?,I'm on page 18 and I'm ready to junk it. He's obviously never been toKenya. He can't seem to decide whether a wildebeast has a calf or a foal. It's a calf.NO animal can give birth to young with horns. Think about it!
2,"Science is good, story isn't","I bought this book based on the reviews comparing it favorably to other books like ""Neanderthal"". In reality there is no comparison. This book spends more time developing the economic and political situation of Kenya than on the characters.This subject -- finding an ancestor of man alive in modern times -- had the potential to explore many different areas of what it means to be human; to look at social and cultural adaptations over time, etc. None of which were seriously looked at.This is definitely one book that gets donated to the public library, so that other people don't have to spend money to read it."
2,Almost Good,"Almost Good, that's how I'd put it. The idea is great but the storyline is too personal to the authors fantasies. There ARE a few good moments. But really, attracted to a monkey?Also, some of the action sequences reflect a suspension of the laws of physics.I was disappointed because this could have been a marvelous book"
3,Interesting--but could have been better,"This is an entertaining (if not inspired) story which had the potential to be much more than it became.Contains some questionable ""facts"" (although calling a baboon a monkey is NOT among them -- rf previous review). The writing is a bit clumsy in places and a trifle condescending -- especially in the early exposition (e.g. I really don't need to have the author define ""bipedal"" for me). Plot elements sometimes are a little too predictable.Still, if you're interested in paleoanthropology, this one is worth a look."
3,"""Almost Adam"" is not short on ""monkey business.""","While he gives us an interesting plot, author Petru Popescu makes a glaring error on page 142 when he refers to baboons as ""monkeys."" The reader would expect two years of research to at least inform the author that monkeys are New World; baboons are apes!The reader who unabashedly accepts the evolutionary theory as fact will have no problems with Mr. Popescu's premise. Educated readers who are not so ready to join the evolutionary school will sometimes chuckle at his conclusions.Ralph M. Cooper, Ph.D.University of North Carolina, Chapel Hil"
1,"So bad, I couldn't finish it","I am glad I bought this book at a used bookstore. The story sounds intriguing, but don't be fooled. The characters are not developed, nor do they develop throuhgout the story. And the dialogue is terrible. The writing in general is just terrible. It was so bad I literally could not finish reading it."
4,Great Book,"This is great adventure book about a scientist discovering a hominid boy who leads him to the others of his kind. The most interesting parts of the book are the days Ken Lauder, an anthropologist, spend with the boy as well as a time they spent with the boy's band. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in adventure fiction as well as the mystery of human origins. This book would be better if the author would remove the unrest and revolution scenes from the text. They have nothing to do with the story."
1,NO STARS,"I picked up this book for a dollar - the bookstore was closing down and I thought I was getting a bargain. I should have left it there with my dollar. Artificial dialogue, contrived suspense, carboard characters, cheap literary techniques (DON'T MISS repeated needlessly as if to connect the characters) and questionable ""science"" (the author admits so), all in the foreground of political intrigue- I am flabbergasted by the 5 star ratings - what are you people reading??? It would not be unfair for Michael Crichton to be upset that this work has been compared with his works (incidentally, Congo wasn't so great either)."
4,Realistic and well-researched,"I've read a number of books in the same genre, and few have compared. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the story, I also felt I was learning a great deal about anthopology and paleontology. The characters are incredibly likable and the ""scenery"" is believable and entrancing. If you like realistic and well-researched ""what if"" science novels, this is worth a read."
4,"Almost Adam, but not quite","An interesting plot. Well written, but it was just beyond the believable. Ken Lauder has just TOO MUCH good luck. Crash lands almost on top of a significant find. Encounters not one, but two ""lost"" tribes of proto-humans. Survives lion attacks, forest fires and murder attempts. Should make a great Costner film."
4,Speculative science and mystery a la Crichton,"This is not great literature, but it doesn't claim to be. Instead, it's your Michael Crichton format -- suspense combined with free-wheeling (sometimes TOO free-wheeling) scientific speculation. Lots of interesting tidbits on paleontology and the origins of the human species. The plot runs into some rather incredulous developments at times, but there is enough to keep the reader going. If you've enjoyed books like Crichton's ""Andromeda Strain,"" ""Sphere,"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" you will most likely enjoy this as well -- even though it is a bit more plodding in places"
3,This is a purchase that I will never regret.,"I have a lot of relatives in Monongalia County in West Virginia. This has helped me a lot in putting some of the pieces together in my search for my lineage. I found that some of her information was slightly incorrect, but the genesis of the information led me in the write direction. I was particularly impressed with the history of the County. The detail that Connie P. Rice went into was very beneficial in understanding the people of West Virginia. For myself, this was a purchase that I will never regret."
4,Comprehensive Endeavor,"Comprehensive endeavor at showing how African Americans lived in a border county... race relations issues are weakly framed and the complexities of them are glossed over.... There was actually very little effort to enforce Virginia laws against free blacks before the Civil War and Ms. Rice posits local elites as being repressive and this was not the case. She also ignores the issue of miscegenation which was an important aspect of relations in this particular county. Ms. Rice also does not focus on the role of the Mason Dixon Line and the differences free blacks encountered between Pennsylvania and Virginia/West Virginia. The photographs are MAGNIFICENT and make the book worthwhile, regardless of any minor flaws."
5,Finally some useful answers,I was very surprised at the number of new ideas and unique approaches the Sears hadn't written about before in any of their other books. I'm looking forward to getting some much needed sleep!!!
3,Pros and Cons,"Here are the pros and cons of this book:PRO:- Gentle, attachment-based advice for solving sleep problems and keeping them from occuring in the first place- Good explanation of how children sleep- Engaging writing style, easy to read- Lots of subheadings, making information easy to find- Good indexCON:- Very repetitive, could shorten book by half and not lose any content- Completely attachment-parenting based, no discussion of alternatives- Heavy-handed on co-sleeping and breastfeeding- Jugmental at times- Product-pushing for the Amby Sleep Thingy and some Co-sleeper- Does not add much to ""The Baby Book"" by the same authorsVERDICT:I liked this book, but if you do not subscribe to attachment parenting, then this is not the book for you. If you enjoy the Sears's other books, you will like this one."
1,Bogus Reviews!,"Nice that all of these reviews are posted multiple times, word for word, for different books. I WAS going to buy a few of them."
2,Only good for stay at home moms,"This book has a strong bias toward co-sleeping and nursing for several years. It does not have any tips for increasing sleep for a working mom, and it offers no help to anyone that does not want to share a bed with their 3 year old."
2,Only good for stay-at-home moms,"This book is great if you are a stay-at-home mom who intends to breastfeed for 2-5 years.Seriously, though, I think it's very important to point out that this book does not offer a METHOD for sleep training, but rather a lot of little suggestions to facilitate sleep in a baby-is-the-boss type of household. Many of the ""happy endings"" are about families who, after 3 years, feel they have succeeded because the mom and child sleep in the parents' bed and breastfeed throughout the night, while the father sleeps on the floor of the nursery or the mother wears the baby in a sling 24 hours a day even after a year.For parents who work, enjoy sleeping together in their bed while the child sleeps in his/her own bed, and breastfeed for less than a year or not at all, this book is a waste of time. I recommend the Ferber book highly, as it offers an actual method and some scientific information, and worked for us after only 2 days."
4,Food for thought,"It's difficult to rate a book like this, in my opinion. It really depends on what your parenting technique will be, is or is developing into. I have read several different sleep books and have taken something out of each one that works for us. Some of it I agree with and some I don't. This book is very much geared towards supporting, comforting and parents assisting the babies to sleep, not so much toward early sleep training. Great book to read if thats the technique you plan to try."
2,For attachment parents only,"I bought this book in a sleep-deprived haze when my baby was waking every two hours during the night. Instead of offering advice, strategies, or even sympathy, I was told that this sleep-deprivation is ""nightime parenting"" and that I should enjoy my baby while he is small and needy. The attachment parenting spin on this book is so strong that it is virtually useless to anyone who does not follow this philosophy. I sent this book off to Goodwill. I much prefer the book by Mark Weisbluth, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. Weisbluth explains baby sleep, at what ages certain naps develop, and most importantly, lays out various strategies for getting your child to sleep better."
4,Helpful tips,"This book really helped us with our first boy. We were able to get him to sleep better at night by following some tips, including making sure they napped properly during the day and winding down way before bed time."
5,The Right Solution For Your Baby,"It helped me. This book understands that there is not one sleep solution and helps you find the right solution for your family. After trying and failing at other sleep methods, I bought this book. With the help and encouragement of this book, we figured out our son and we were able to help him learn to relax and go to sleep. Now he goes to bed very easily and stays there all night."
5,The Coolest Album I ever heard,"This album is, Quite simply, great.Right from the outset the outstanding talent of the band is clear. The catchy and hilarious lyrics are some of the best written ever, and I haven't played the album to a single person who hasnt been amazed by the musical talent.Some of the shorter songs (there are 4 song that are the same, only sung in defferent languages) may not impress everyone, but they merely act as a buffer to ensure you mind isnt blown by the inredibility of such tracks as I Play Bass and Blue Ice Cream.Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed!"
3,"..takes up where ""Resist"" left off?","The Amaazon Album Details at the top of this page sound a little misleading...to say the least. This is not another dance, drum 'n bass, upbeat...whatever you wanna call it album. The sound is different, which for some people may or not be a good thing. I, probably like most others, were expecting more sound like that of ""Resist"". Which would have been totally fine, because that album was great and full of catchy beats with a strong female vocalist. Kokopelli has a more rock sound, and while the strong vocals are still there, there's also a lot of guitar heard throughout the album. If you're into the drum 'n bass sound, think twice about this one.If you want more sound from Kosheen like that of their debut, try the Japanese Import of Resist, which has a second disc of remixes and originial tracks not found on the regular Resist. There are some very good tracks there, an Import definitely worth its price."
5,awesome,This toy is sooooooo coool. You might have a little trouble getting the snitch to stay in his hand but so what. if you bend his legs to fit the broom it looks like snitch chasing harry. I got this toy yesterday and I have not put it down it is a must have for anyone.
5,"Harry, Harry, Harry","This is definitely the coolest of all the Harry action figures. None of them really LOOK like him, but this one is so cool that it doesn't really matter. The little Snitch is SO AWESOME! It'd be cooler if he came with a more realistic broomstick, and most of the stuff that comes with the figures is lame (little games, whatever). What would be really neat is to have a little letter that came with Harry, his Hogwarts letter, on a real little scroll. Or a Hedwig with real feathers. Or for Q. Harry in particular, all the Quidditch balls, not just the Snitch. How about some real leather? Removable gloves? Hair that you can comb? (Hello, at least half of the HP fandom is female! And don't think that some of the boys wouldn't like to comb Harry's tousled tresses as well!) What about some high quality figurines for those of us who are willing to shell out the cash? I'd be into that."
1,Nice looking but not as useful or durable as we hoped,"We have had the Quidditch Harry figure less than a week and my son and his friends who aren't usually too hard on toys have played with it about twice and his foot broke off. This may be a fluke, but I'm not sure. His leg sticks out at a funny angle. When we tried to use it with the powercaster playset we couldn't get his foot to lock in position. I'm sure this repeated trying is why it broke off. I tried as well and couldn't get it to work at all. I should think this toy and any toy meant for younger boys and girls should be more durable. Toys aren't too fun when they are broken."
5,"""Tall Man"" worth buying","I got my copy of ""The Tall Man"" complete series and am very happy with it. The transfers are pretty good and well worth watching. I thank Timeless Media Group for giving us the complete series."
5,Great,The Tall Man - Complete TV Series - All 75 EpisodesGo glad I purchased this video for my collection.
2,No Good,"This book is not only overpriced. But, it is outdated as well...by 15 years. Making this book more or less useless in regards to removing graffiti. Because, newer chemicals are being used to remove newer dye type components of ink and paint that is used to deface property with graffiti.You are better off to save your money and buy a book that is able to match the graffiti of today. I think common sense dictates this."
1,Why CPM?? why???,"OK...Cpm got 7 or 8 nice punk pop songs...some reminds me Bad Religion and Nofx...But unfortunately these guys totally produce a EMO atmosphere to go to the mainstream of the mtv...They go on the wrong way and really sell out to a kind of little girls punk pop attitude...Why, Cpm? You could have been a more hardcore act but turns into a EMO crap!sad!"
1,correct box but wrong color,"I truly love Borghese Hydo Minerali cream finish makeup and was disappointed to recieve a box saying Biscotto #3 makeup only to find inside the box carmelleto. I had already thrown away all my packaging since I thought {because of what the box had titled} that I had the right shade of makeup, BUT I had carmelletto, they put the wrong shade in the box. VVery disappointing."
5,Wonderful product - the best I've found,"I have used Borghese Hydro-Minerali Makeup for more years than I'd like to admit. It does a great job - even on my ""older"" complexion. In summer I mix 2 colors for a sunless tan effect. I had previously purchased it at a Mall store - they no longer carry it. Found it again on Amazon, and for less $$!"
2,made me TOO alert to sleep,I think this may be an ok product if you are looking for something to make you calm yet alert in the day time...but I bought it for help with sleep and I was awake about every 20 minutes and as alert as all get out! Yikes!
2,Does not work,"This product did not work at all for me, in fact it made it harder for me to sleep for some reason. I have had insomnia since 17 years old. I am now 36. The only thing that has ever worked for me was ambien but you cannot take ambien for long amounts of time. This product did not work at all so if you have serious sleeping problems as I do I would not reccommend this product . Very disappointed and still sleepless."
1,Too strong for me!,"I take an antihistamine to sleep every night (25mg) and have taken Valerian root also, thought I stopped taking it because it was making dizzy as a side effect from taking for too many years. I took Melissa one capsule, and OMG...I felt like I was taking a narcotic....hallucinations and strange dreams. Will not take again. Waste of $. If you want to try it I would buy the extract so you can only take a few drops at a time...that would be better. Capsules way too much!."
1,Do not buy,This has no affect what so ever ive gave it to fiends family and myself and it does absolutely NOTHING
1,I'd Like My Money Back,To say I was disappointed does not cover the depth of my feelings about this product. I feel like a sucker for purchasing it and will never purchase this type of produce in any manner every again.
5,Awesome!,"Either mind over matter or these really help me to sleep and not feel groggy in the morning! I take two before bed at night.....this may be tmi but it may also be helpful to some....I tend to ""burp"" these up if I end up staying awake longer than intended."
4,Very easy networking!,"I'm good with PCs, building them, fixing them, blah blah but I have NO clue when it comes to networking. This is virtually plug and play with windows XP. I had no problems setting this network up, am getting a signal strength of ""very good"" from about 20' away from the router in another room. I am however experiencing lag every 60-120 seconds when gaming, something I didn't experience prior to installing this. At this point I'm not sure if it's normal or something wrong with this device. But other than that (gaming isn't everything), it's fine."
4,the good & the bad,"This wireless modem is great, I can take my computer anywhere in my house and I get great speeds. I download stuff at up to 200kbps, and my computer is about 30 ft from the DSL. The only bad I have found with it, is if you are an avid Counter-Strike player, it causes spikes about every 2 minutes (I think this only happens with Windows XP, which I have). If you can find a way to fix this please tell me."
2,unstable after reboot,I have the same problem list the other user. The MA101 always stop working after I restarted the computer. I have to reinstall the driver and reboot several times before it works again. The problem occurs almost every time I shutdown the PC. I installed the new driver from their website but still didn't help either. It's very frustrating. I rather go back to my wire network. I can't recommend this product.
2,Not compatible with Windows XP,"This adapter works well in Windows ME, but its ""network utility"" software will not install and run properly in Windows XP. Do not buy this adapter if you plan on using XP."
1,No SMP support and horrible tech support,This device caused two different dual cpu Xp systems to bluescreen every hour or so. Booting the same systems with only one cpu enabled fixes the problem. Netgear tech support was no help at all because they had no known issues about xp compatibility. They offered no solutions to my problem. I grow tired of companies that slap NT compatibilty on the box but don't even bother with SMP compatibility. Due to the horrible tech support and poor drivers I recommend you avoid this product no matter what type of system you have. The one time I don't buy linksys... :( Thank goodness it isn't too late to exchange it.
2,Troublesome on Windows XP,Tried (with Netgear wireless router MR814) many times on Win XP Home and failed. Talked with Tech Support several times and they can't fix it. Also find that Netgear MR814 drop SSH connections after 5 min's idle. Then return them all. Now I am using Siemens USB adapter and D-Link PC Card and they are working fine.
5,Up and running in no time,I spent an hour reading the instruction manuals; then spent the next two hours to get things up and running. Equipment used: Netgear's MR814 wireless router and MA101 USB adapter. The MR814 is attached to Windows98 machine and the MA101 is attached to a Windows XP machine. The adapter has been working flawlessly running at 11Mbps from about 80 ft away [the adapter and the wireless router are on separate floors]. I activated WEP-encryption to maintain a layer of security. Keying in the encryption-code during MA101-activation was a very minor irritation.
5,"Great, easy to use","I have both the ma111 and the ma101, they both run flawlessly. The set up is easy and well explained. I didn't want to run cat 5 cables all over my house to connect my pc's. I have 3 pc's that are on my network. 2 desktops and one laptop......I have played around with my laptop in different rooms and have no problems maintaining connections.Max range is about 150 foot in the clear, and about half that through walls and such. I'm sure I could get better range but I would be in my neighbors yard, I don't see me needing that kind of range..... my point is that it works great indoors at my house, 2 story with 4 walls still no problems.I feel for the money I spent I got more than what I paid for, these days that's a bargain."
3,Mostly great,"This works great with my Netgear router/wireless base station, but won't work with my university's wireless areas. I've used the university wireless service with my girlfriend's Linksys adapter, but not even the computing center's gurus could make this play nice with the authentication system. Too bad, I just use it at home on the couch."
3,Not very reliable.,"Not very good card. I got this,instead of the MA401, so that I can use it for both laptop and desktop. I have to say it is disappointing and, at times, frustrating to use. It frequently disappear from the desktop and the system reports that it has problem loading the driver. I have to uninstall and reinstall the driver and go through multiple reboots.. Even that sometime fails to help. I sometime spend an hour or so playing with the device and still cannot get the device to show up.Admittedly, when it shows up and stays on, it works just fine. I sometime suspect the its diappearance has much to do with the moving nature of a laptop computer. But this also happened to my desktop computer, although not as frequently... I strongly recommend against it if you intend to use this on a laptop."
4,Works great in spite of abuse,"This unit set right up on my daughters desktop computer. It wasn't quite plug and play, as I did have to load the driver from the disc that came with the unit. But, it didn't have any issues with loading.It was worked fine for the most part, in spite of my daughter throwing it across the room. She also kicks it around and steps on it. The little plastic that goes around the antenna has popped off, but we were able to pop it back on.We did have a couple of occasions where it did cease to work. I am not sure what happened. My daughter's computer was a mess due to viruses and spyware from all the sites she visited. To get it working again, we just had to plug it into a different USB port on the computer."
1,Did not get it to work...,"Bought this device to ad-hoc connect my desktop PC to my new Centrino laptop.I read the installation manual carefully, ran setup first before plugging the device - lo and behold! The configuration utility was nowhere to be seen. Thought it was a glitch and ran the setup in the ""utility""-directory on the CD. It only gave me the option to ""modify"" (resulting in a blank list!), repair or uninstall. Well, repair still did nothing.Then I look in my programs-folder and found this utility. Wlandfu.exe told me matrix-like that ""There is no WLAN-adapter.""WlanMonitor.exe just told me the status and the about. And gave me the red light.Well, the succeeding driver revisions 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2RC2 (beta!) did nothing to change the situation.I'll return this beautiful little piece tomorrow and get something that works..."
1,Disconnects you and gives very signal warning.,I spent days with technicians who could not help me. The signal is low and nobody knows where. It disconnets you from internet.The distance from the router is not 1/100th of what the specifications say.
4,Works great with TiVo,"I got this for my Tivo Series2 and it works great. It was easy to set up. I actually bought this used from Amazon, from some dude. I'm 100% satisfied with the process and the purchase."
2,"Fine for web browsing, but that's about it.","The good: It installs easily enough, and I've always had excellent signal strength with it.The bad: If you're using Windows XP and want to do anything but browse the Internet, return this adapter immediately! It is NOT compatible with the Wireless Zero Config service in XP. Every 60 seconds, it drops the connection and reconnects in about 5 seconds. So this adapter is fairly useless for online games, streaming mp3's from another pc on the network, SSH connections, or anything else that requires constant connections.The ugly: It seems as if NetGear has completely abandoned this product! The software download page makes you guess which driver is the right one, and it hasn't been updated in forever... Maybe there's just not a way to fix it...My verdict: If you just want to browse the web, and you can pick one up cheap, go for it. But with Linksys adapters selling for the same price, I can't see why you would."
3,not fully compatible with windows xp,"I am using this adapter under ad-hoc mode to connect my laptop.It seems windows xp's wireless zero configuration service will stop the wireless connection very 50 seconds for about 2 or 3 seconds, which makes watch stream video and voice chat almost impossible.After disabling this service, it works ok. So if you do not need to change configuration frequently please disable it."
3,"Tick-Tock, The End is Near, Throw Out Your DVD Players and Commence the Fear...","Generally, a good collection, but there are three stories that don't go anywhere at all. The stories didn't grab my attention in the first few pages, so all hope was gone. However, the other stories--""A Watery Silence"", ""Mrs. Lurie and the Rapture"", ""The Call"", especially--were good writing."
3,A good but not great collection of stories,I thought the collection of stories were a little uneven here. One of them had a zombie slowly deteriorating and was pointless. It was one of those stories that must have paid the bills for the writer. Other than that it there were half good and half bad. It was still worth the price of the book. The better tales like the one where the soldiers are wondering about their final days on earth were more realistic than usual.
3,An average collection of short stories,"I read this book about a year ago. None of the stories are really memorable. There was time travel, demons, mysterious unexplained happenings - pretty much all the end-of-the-world scenarios. I skimmed it again a couple of weeks ago looking for a particular short story. This really is a mediocre gathering. No reflection on Drake - he's one of my favorite authors, but he should not have branded this book with his name."
4,"Good stories, a good mix of styles and themes.","I enjoyed most of the stories in this book. Some of them were quite humorous, whereas others were very thought-provoking. I'd suggest sitting down and reading through the book of Revelations in the bible ahead of time, if you want to catch some of the smaller details in the stories."
3,Some good and some bad,"Not a bad book. I usually don't enjoy short stories, but the selections for this book were pretty good. One particular story involved the different powers involved with the afterlife, and how they were competing for the end of the world.Overall if you like end of the world stories, like I do, you will have to pick this one up."
5,LOVE IT!,Love this item. One of my most essential! Plenty of room for a full bladder AND items in the pouches! Need to get a new one since mine was left at an ex's and she never wanted to return it. Would buy this product 100 times over!
3,Camelbak for runners,"This product works well. Just as described. It is, however, not ideal for runners. It is bulky and makes a very distracting sloshing sound while running. I now keep mine in the closet when I run, and on my (or, preferably, my boyfriend's) back while hiking!"
4,Wizard Women of the North,Beautiful lilting women's voices - wonderful to listen to even if you can't understand the language. Folk music that transcends interpretation.
5,Unusual and Astounding!,"It is eerily beautiful, amazing and astounding! It touches the heart and takes the listener into a mystical and fascinating world!"
4,Very Pleased - but it through Amazon Canada though,"This is a wonderful CD and for anyone who likes a surreal feel to music this is for sure a great album to have!I'm not sure exactly how I did it, but when shopping around for this album I was redirected to Amazon Canada. The listed 'in-stock' price was a fraction of what was listed on the US Amazon store and to top it off - I got my CD 'the next day'; no kidding I about fell out of my chair.Anyway, it's a great album, I just wish the group would get a better marketing/sales staff for US sales."
1,does not work,"I bought this thing last week for my Panasonic AG-DVX100B. This charger did not fit my camcorder's battery. Even that it said ""Product DescriptionFor following Panasonic Camcorder models: AG-DVC15, AG-DVC30, AG-DVC60, AG-DVC7, AG-DVX100, AG-DVX1000...""No wonder it's cheap...cuz it does not work."
3,Sling-link,"This is a very nice device and worked well for the out-of-box experienceHowever, when I connect this to my Sony Viao SL1, it connected at < 12kbps speed. Sony has a Marvell Giga Bit ethernet network silicon and did not like the Sling Link at all..for those utilize the 10/100 connection, it should work fine. However, for GbE connection, please be aware it may not work... called SlingMedia and they have never done any test with the GbE... FYI"
1,don't buy it if you can't retrun it.,"Make sure you can return the product. It produced a very weak signal, even in the next room, so that what I received on my slingobx was useless.I live in an old house so it may be something in my walls or wiring that is inhibiting the connection, but it did not work for me"
4,Slingbox Connection,Everything was easy to install and worked as advertised. With this being the case I am very happy!
1,Sling Media,"All sling media products (Slingbox Pro and this SlingLink) have been the biggest pain in the butt. It is advertised as so easy to hook up, practicaly plug and play. My *SS! Their support is minimal, I have put the items I purchased back up for sale since I can't get it working on my network."
1,Doesn't work,The SlingLink would not work with the wireing in my house. Wasted a lot of time finding this out.
1,not pleased,"If your computer and your slingbox are in different rooms, the two products have to be on the same circuit or else they won't work. I had to return the product."
3,Link also depends on the quality of the wiring,"The SlingLink boxes are great out of the box -- truly plug and connect. However please note that, as other reviewers have mentioned, you have to be on the same circuit to connect the SlingBox and your router. In addition, the quality of the circuit is a big variable as well. I have noted that the top conection speed between my PC and the SlingBox is around 600kps using the SlingLinks, whereas when connected directly with a Cat 5 cable the connectivity is double the speed. I am not suprised by the lower quality of my wiring based on other problems I have had in my condo (poor quality from the builder). Due to the speed limitation with the SlingLinks, there is a time delay between my PC and the SlingBox, but its bearable (about 2 secs). However, I have decided that if I am going to travel, I will extend a cable through my living room, hallway and den so I can fully utilize the 2mbps upload speed from my ISP to connect remotely."
1,Completely Disappointed,"I admit that I purchased this book mostly because it advertised a coupon for a free directory of international employers. When I called the company to order the book, I found out that the directory dates from 1994. Obviously I decided to forgoe paying the $10 to have it shipped to me. Otherwise, I have been diligently trying websites that are listed in the book and many of them no longer exist or have very little useful information for international career listings or other job search aids. This book is to be avoided."
5,The dirt on jobs that involving living and working abroad,"Compiled and written by Daniel Lauber with the assistance of Kraig Rice, International Job Finder: Where The Jobs Are Worldwide is a straightforward presentation with all the facts and all the dirt on jobs that involving living and working abroad. Of special merit is the advice for avoiding international job scams, adapting to the host nation's culture, and safeguarding against anti-American threats. 1,200 of the most effective online and offline resources for finding international jobs on all seven continents make International Job Finder an essential and invaluable resource and reference for anyone serious about job-hunting abroad."
5,"simple, and work great with linux","this is very simple installation in linux (uses tulip_cb)just plug in, and worksand no gripe at all for months running 24/7that's all"
2,Amplified corded phone,"This phone adequate for hearing impaired such as myself, however, for ease of use and programing of regularly called numbers it could use some work. I was replacing a caller ID phone with this one only because i couldn't hear the callers. It was a much easier phone to use."
1,Find another phone,This is the worst phone. First off it didn't ring. Second the phones light blink 24/7. The sound quality isn't the greatest and the boost doesn't do much. I wouldn't waste the money.
3,"Ok, but not universally useful","Some of this plan was useful, but much of it is just not applicable in my situation. I teach in an urban school and have no budget for replicating an island environment (advocated in the plan) and because of weak attendance cannot do multi-day cooperative lessons (key students are missing from day to day.) I found the tests to be mostly recall, although the essay questions were better at rooting out analysis and evaluation thought."
1,Fairly Useless,"Very old-school and bare-bones material is here. I defintately wasted $20. I am most interested in dynamic lesson plans and those provided here involve mostly reading in class, i.e, not real lessons. Are we supposed to get kids into the material or bore them to death? The supplimentary material, like vocabulary worksheets, is fairly useful. There is far better things available free on the web."
2,A Disappointment,"This book is a collection of some 100 quotes culled from a variety of sources. The quotes are woven together by a text which covers roughly the 14th to the 20th century of the history of Burma, now called Myanmar. The result is a combination patchwork of facts and opinions that unfortunately are not only often incoherent but sometimes appear bias in nature For example, very little mention is made of the brutal 2 year war waged by the British to wrench control of Upper Burma from native hands. In this regard the reader cannot help but note what may be interpreted as a pro-British stance. Because of the disjointed nature of this Burma history I found it difficult to follow and ultimately tiresome. There is a bibliography of the works quoted as well as a list of the works which were consulted."
3,Rhymin' and Shinin',"This tight little EP compilation displays real aspects of b-boyism' and raw production/lyricism from a variety of different angles. Dr. Oop and Samson S provide the stand out material here, with Bedroom Produksionz clocking in a few seconds behind on ""Just Say When"". PM lags on ""Monsterous"",however, and the beat alone will have mad heads reaching for the 'track skip' button on their Sony Discman. The paranoid lyrics on ""Stereotypical"" also will lose cats whose heads are still vibrating from the banger ""Who Knows"". Worth a listen, the solid tracks will have this one in your CD player more than a few times. Also, the overall modesty of the MCs is a nice change of pace from the typical braggadocio with no back up. Afterall, we are talkin' about hip-hop here, aren't we?"
2,Annoying,"I like Dutch audio that I can listen to over & over again. The polka music on this really turns me off, as does the unnecessary babbling of Marlene. Why can't she just say ""Tom and Penny are in a restaurant""? Why do I need to know what they're doing exactly & why? I mean, I've got the booklet! I can follow along! I got all excited at the end because I thought the last disc was just conversations in Dutch that I could listen to over & over again, but again, the conversations are only 30 seconds long with lots of babbling. I was bummed because I really liked the content of the conversations, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of one.Get Pimsleur, or for even more Dutch that you can play over & over again (if you don't mind reading the English parts), get Living Language Dutch. I love that one."
4,Seelenluft - Synchronschwimmer,"On his SYNCHRONSWIMMER EP, Seelenluft shows off the genesis of what will soon become his debut album, The Rise and Fall of Silvercity-Bob. There's lots of sweeping synths like whale calls and slide guitars on ""Wasser-Kur 1"" for a graceful dive into sonic bliss, while ""Land-Kur 1"" takes a more rhythmic approach. ""Land-Kur 2"" blends a gentle guitar strum with a thick double bass and a voice-tone that seems to pierce the air, and ""Bademeister"" thrums with a sort of dark jazz. The remix of ""Wasser-Kur 1"" has a spry bounce, one that suggests a secret joyousness, even if the track isn't outwardly happy. It's these contradictions that make Seelenluft's music so compelling."
4,Easy to use but oriented to the Western Sierras,"This is a very concise and easy to use book. However, like many Sierra Nevada natural history books and field guides it is more oriented and useful to the Western Sierra. If you spend most of your time in the Eastern Sierra it may be inadequate or misleading."
4,Sierra Nevada Tree Identifier,this book is really helpful in my line of work..I found it to be very easy to use and understand. the drawings are good with the leaf and fruit displayed.
4,Good Reference for Bebes,"I have several other of Seeley's books and there are repeats of some of the doll from her collection, but there are pages of body markings, mouth types,ears, feet,and hands. Good background on the old methods of making the dolls as well as a more modern method. Almost every page has good color pictures of dolls many in full page size. Not a bad thing to have on your reference shelf for the dolls and costumes."
4,Unvarnished Truth from an Oracle Craftsman,"OOP applies Goldratt'sThe Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvementto the Oracle DBMS. A quite readable bridge between theory and practice with few missteps. The best parts: clear exposition and stories, especially (1) why ""eliminate unnecessary work"" is usually the best approach, (2) why Oracle's so-called ""wait events"" aren't ""waits"" in queuing parlance. OOP is a great way to get the most business value from your configured Oracle system.Missteps are, in my experience, (1) too much Markovian queuing theory and formulas --discrete event simulation with real world distributions is far more practical (2) no guidance on what to do when you've ""maxed out"" your existing configuration... add more CPU? more disk? dunno.I've had this book on my shelf since 2004 beside Tom Kyte'sExpert Oracle: Signature Edition (Expert One-On-One). Both are essential classics for the Oracle practitioner."
2,Not really the best approach anymore,This book does not consider the issues relating to the Oracle wait interface is is too dated.
5,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,I want to have an advantage over all the other Oracle DBAs! I've been reading Cary Millsap's papers since the 70s and always found them to be right on the money. His VLDB paper is a classic. He is THE Oracle guru. I'm only half-way through the book and consider it money well spent.
5,A MUST READ for Anyone with Knee Or Hip Problems,"I discovered Dr. Grelsamer's books last fall after undergoing an unnecessary knee arthroscopy that caused more pain and problems than before. If I had read Dr. Grelsamer's advice earlier, I could have avoided six months of trauma, but even so, Dr. Grelsamer's straightforward guidance and treatment suggestions have been critical to my present well-being. Characteristically candid and entertaining, Dr. Grelsamer explains in detail all the information readers need to know to make sensible decisions about hip and knee replacement surgery. He challenges routine testing techniques that contribute to diagnoses which are often misleading, and explains which controversial breakthroughs are safe and reliable, such as mini-incision surgeries and the latest implants. This book is a MUST READ for all active adults and teens. Thank you, Dr. Grelsamer, for giving us the tools and knowledge to be informed consumers!"
2,Out of Date,"Unfortunately, this book does not go into any detail that you can't easily find on the web. It's out of date; no coverage of the new hip resurfacing techniques."
2,It looks Cheap in person,This necklace watch's gold looks very cheap in person. It looks better in the picture. I would not buy it again. I was actually a little embarrassed when I saw it because it was delivered as a gift. But I guess you get what you paid for.
1,A Watch that doesn't change time,"At first appearance the watch was great...easy to read numbers both on outside and inside, necklace was long enough, it was working and the time was set correctly...a good watch for the price. However, how do you change the time? There were no instructions enclosed and the pin on the top doesn't do anything. It appears you have to take the watch apart to change the time or send it in to the company. It has a lifetime warranty for repairs but should changing the time be considered a repair. I think not. Why pay for shipping when it should be something I can simply do?"
2,Shaky,"I actually bought the HS-3WH, which is the same thing but white. The cord is thick and it looks awkward because it doesn't run smoothly down your shirt, it goes down in a zigzag pattern (like a wrinkly headset). Also the earbuds are a little larger than most and it is hard to get them to fit correctly in your ears. Mine have fallen out many times. The only thing from saving the buds from falling to the ground is the neck strap.I have owned mine for over a month now and have been having some problems. At first one of the channels was going out on the left headphone and eventually I lost the entire left side. The microphone has also gone out on it too and I know this because the people on the 'other end' cannot hear me. The concept is really good, they just need to work on the design."
2,Good quality but awful design,"As if this thing was not designed for consumer but submarines in 1950s, it will probably last worst usage but uncomfortable.The cord is a very thick protective metal like a coil. Earpieces also sound good and feels durable.But sturdy cord design makes is uncomfortable. Stiffness of the cord makes earpieces move in your ear if you move the phone. Earpieces are largest I have seen so far. They are not comfortable."
3,bulky but useful,"sounds OK, awkwardly designed, no voume control, no remote control, just answers and hangs up calls. stupidly produced primary for the phone function rather than media player. Nokia needs to learn a lot from headset manufacturers how to design a headset. what's more, it's costly like jewel."
1,worst headset ever,"The buds barely fit in your ears and when you get them in there it feels like they are stretching them out. Feel very light and cheap. One of the earbuds started going out on the 2nd day I had them. If you buy these, don't pay more than a few bucks because they really aren't even worth that."
5,Best Knife I've Ever Used,"I've used many different utility knives and they all got the job done. But I didn't know what I was missing until I borrowed one of these from someone else! I immediately knew I had to get some.Pros: Yes, it is fixed blade, but that's what you want in most situations, such as cutting carpet. There's less play in the blade due to the lack of sliding mechanism. Also, the blades are some of the best, the screw doesn't fall out when you take it apart, and the extra blades store magnetically inside. Most importantly, the feel of this knife is perfect. Fits in your hand like it's made for it. Real nice.Cons: don't buy it if you have kids around. It is fixed and it is *sharp*."
3,"works but is a fixed blade, very dangerous.. but works","I assumed it was, a standard utility knife, but missed that it was a fixed blade. the knife works fine for what it supposed to do. it does come with 3 blades."
2,Inexpensive and that's what you get.,"these jars are inexpensive but they are also of poor quality. the glass has lines and defects, and the lids are metal with a sharp edge along the bottom that feels like it could slice your finger."
2,"Poor quality, breaks easily","I got these as a wedding gift in July 2010, via Bed Bath and Beyond. These just sit on my counter and don't get moved or pushed around much, so they are under minimal use. In Febrary 2011 (7 months later), the largest jar got a huge crack in it, which has continued to grow and has now rendered the canister unusable.The plastic threads on the second to largest size became unglued from the stainless steel lid. Upon examination, I discovered that they had only glued it in two places, with only a small amount of glue.Also something to take note of is that the openings aren't wide; they are about 3.75 inch diameter from inside rim to inside rim. The advertised 4.25 inch diameter mush be from outside rim to outside rim. My 1 cup measuring cup will not fit in the canisters, which is extremely inconvenient."
1,ANDREW62233,Item arrived in a million pieces because it was not packaged correctly. We returned the item and received a credit.
1,DAMAGED ON DELIVERY,product is made of glass... came in a box directly from Target.... was packaged incorrectly so all the containers were shattered
4,Revealing Book!,I've seen Carol Everett on TV and heard her speak about how she was so into the abortion business and how she became hardened inside from feeling any remorse or regret about what she was doing. Thank God He broke through those walls and turned her around!
5,Absolutely stellar,"The mark of a good soundtrack should be one that not only takes the listener back into the spirit of the film, but stands on its own as a coherently-assembled and respectable whole, rather than a marketing tag for the movie.""The Virgin Suicides"" soundtrack is all of this: evocative, haunting, and cohesive, this album not only recaptures the tonality of the movie, but echoes the time period without being blatant and predictable.This is an unforgettable soundtrack to an unforgettable film."
5,One of the Greatest Soundtracks,"If you have lived in the 70s...or rather lived the 70's, you must buy this soundtrack. Aside from being absolutely perfect for Copolla's haunting movie (which perfectly depicted the 70's in a nostalgic detail, along with a chilling theme based on teenage love and death), the music on this track really takes you back. I personally like the tracks by Heart...they remind me of my rebellious days...they don't make songs like this anymore."
4,Good but left out a few goodies,Overall a decent soundtrack for 70s fans. Can someone kindly tell me the names of the songs that were played over the phone by the boys to the lisbon sisters? Only 'Alone Again' is on the soundtrack.
4,Great 70's AM tunes that radio forgot,"Growing up in Los Angeles in the 70's, the songs on this album (except the haunting moody Air pieces) were staples on the airwaves. It's too bad that today's ""classic rock"" radio stations program only a sliver of the good music from that period...and largely forget many of these songs. This is a good snapshot of what you might have heard driving down the 210 Freeway on a warm Summer day in Los Angeles feeling the Santa Ana winds blowing in through the sunroof of your '78 Toyota Celica. Get the album and hum along."
5,A Cd worth adding to your collection,"This is music you can listen to on many levels. As peaceful sounds to fill in the silence of a room, for meditative tranquility to search and achieve an inner calm, or play it as dinner music when you have that ""special someone"" over, this CD works.To listen to it as music, it is minimalist but has many colors and layers to interest the listener. Each time you hear it, there is something new. I would say conservatively, I've played this CD 50 times and marvel at never getting tired of listening to it.Their second CD ""Bali Dua"" is equally compelling and picks up where this CD leaves off. Together, there is nearly 2 hours of tranquility, peace and harmony that will turn your room into a ""space""."
5,Perfect Peace,"There is a reason this CD has not received anything less than 5 stars. It is absolutely one of the best I have heard in the genre.I have to agree with another listener...the beauty here is in the sparseness of the music. Stark, moving, with a melancholy beauty, it is one of those CDs that you just never want to end. Sit down after dark and light a candle...this music will take you to a far off tropical shore and leave you so relaxed and at peace that you won't be able to get out of your chair. I can't recommend this one enough."
5,Amazing,"It is wonderful dreaming, imagining, loving, inspiring, creating music for me. As an artist, I look for sounds that help me create, and this music is profound for me."
4,Humorous children's novel about with science,"This book was written in 1962 and shows it age. Otherwise it's a good book. It deals with a boy working on a science project, but things never work out just right. I read it as a child and liked it and just read it again to encourage my 3rd grader to read it. It is funny and explains the scientific method as well as a children's novel can. For 6th graders or older I would recommend the Mad Scientists Club books--much better but for older kids becasue they have more advanced science."
3,Okay Children's Book,"This book is a children's story, and it's only an okay one. Certainly, considering that it's out of print, there's no real reason to try to track a copy down, as it would probably only appeal to ""nerds,"" anyway. The book centers around one kid's attempt to win the state science contest, how he tries several different things that fail, and realizes how to turn a failure into a winning entry. It's not badly written, and it's even kind of clever in some places, but overall, there's no point in trying to obtain it."
1,Foligen Cream,I've been using the cream for over two months now on my eyebrows and there isn't much of a difference.
1,Didn't work for me!,"Used this product on alternate days for a few weeks. Used it on the temples, and nothing happened. The situation worsened at best"
3,"Mazda Miata MX5 Performance Portfolio, 1989-1997","A compilation of road tests from magazines around the world. Very interesting to read diverse takes on our favorite little sports car, the NA Miata. Could be indexed a little better, and the pictures show a surprising amount of generational detail loss, but all in all a great source of historical performance data."
4,needs to be edited!,i enjoyed this book just like i have all karen kingsbury books. she's by far my favorite author. but i found well over thirty grammatical and punctuation errors that greatly destracted me from the book. I have never had this problem with her other books though and over all it was another good book.
2,On Every Side,"Book is well written, as everything from Karen Kingsbury is. However, the binding on the paper back book was not glued well and is coming apart."
5,"An absolute ""Must Read""","This is one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read. The emotions are non-stop from beginning to end. I could feel the pain and the hurts that these characters were going through because the author did such a good job at bringing them to life. It's not just another love story, but a story of justice and sacrifice, of standing up for what you believe in, no matter the cost, and trusting God to honor that stand. I am deeply moved by the strength and innocence of Faith and it convicted me in many ways to realize that I need to be more like her. I can hardly wait to read more of Karen Kingsbury's books."
2,The worst job of proof reading ever,"This is a decent book if it weren't for the fact that there are literally hundreds of misspelled words and hyphens where they don't belong. Basically, someone scanned a paper book, ran it through an OCR process and then never bothered to clean up the text. It's a mess and if you don't want to decrypt a book in order to read it I'd stay away from this one."
5,Karen Kingsbury has done it again!!!,"I am a huge fan of Karen Kingsbury. Her books are modern and full of today's real life situations that plague Christians everyday. In her latest book, ""On Every Side"", she has once again managed to bring across a very important issue and wind it around a very touching love story that leaves you feeling that if you just believe, anything is possible with God on your side. A real page turner to the very end, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Christian fiction, even if a romance is not exactly what you read."
5,Emotional,I ordered this book for myself and enjoyed reading every page and very emotional and brought tears to my eyes.
4,Good for a start!,"I bought one of these as my first ""official"" tin whistle, -I had one years ago, when I was too young to care, and promptly destroyed it- at Groth Music in a pack for around $24. I must say, it's a fun little thing to play. It's sound is a little more on the shrill side, but it never bothered me much.One thing to note though, it does play quite sharp, so be forewarned. My sister bought a Clarke penny whistle, and this couldn't quite compare. We played them together, and mine was so sharp it hurt to hear them both. I know about variances from whistle to whistle, but I've had two of these, and they both were sharp.All in all, it's a great whistle to start on. If you don't plan on having any accompaniment.)"
2,ok,"The tool was made fine, but if you tip these things or twist them, they cut the screen and you have to start over, there must be a better way"
4,Comprehensive and clear treatment,"The Mac OS 9 seems to bring few improvements over the previous release, you may have thought. Not after you read and benefit from this comprehensive book. You will understand why the Mac is not widespread like the Windows big brother, but it is the best of the two."
5,Easy install,"Fast delivery. Installation a breeze not like some cards I have tried, where you have to keep reloading software. Once installed run installation disk and your ready to go"
4,Glad to meet him,"I was browsing the cd rack and came across the title ""Meet John Stone."" That interested me, so I went out on a limb and purchased it. I am definitly glad I did! Sure, he's not perfect, but this guy deserves a listen. He has a unique voice and I found myself singing his songs the day after I bought the Cd. John Stone - I am glad to meet ya!"
1,This Sucks.,"This album sounds like it was recorded in someones barn.The songs are sophmoric at best and the singer has a 3 note range.I was very disappointed, with the history of greatest that Tootsies Orchid Lounge has with the legends of Country Music, that this pile of steaming turd came out with thier name on it.Destined to be in the .99 cent bin."
3,Not what I thought I had ordered,The product ordered gave the impression of being a text or screenplay of Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL. Instead it turned out to be a commentary on this work. I decided to keep it--or maybe was too lazy to send it back--but it wasn't what I really wanted or expected.
4,Great Pan,"There are many better pans out there, but for the price, you can not beat this one. I have a much nicer saute pan, but I bought this as a cheaper alternative for a second pan (so I could multitask). I've had it for about 4 months and I've done a lot of cooking on it. It does a good job sauteing veggies and creating box meals. It does an ok job searing meats. It does a decent job of evenly distributing the heat throughout the pan surface. The nonstick has held up flawlessly. I don't expect this pan to last forever, but with proper care, I'm sure it will definitely be worth the money I paid for it.On the downside, no lid. I haven't had any luck in finding a lid for this pan. I would have paid extra if this pan included a lid."
5,FABULOUS MUSIC,"I discovered Kurbeti on accident when looking for new music. I love Romani music so I decided to download at random Eli Eli and couldn't believe my ears so I downloaded more. Every single song I've downloaded from this group is fantastic and very danceable. This is not so much folksy gypsy music, a lot of it is urban. Allegro, Love Birds, Antoneta all upbeat and great for dance. There are a few songs which are very slow, soulful... Kurbeti + Please Don't Go.HOT! Highly recommended."
5,impulse buy,"Was at the store and took a risk on this cd since i didnt know whether it was vocals or not. Its really good some are vocals and some arent, but still a great cd."
1,Not what I ordered...,"I bought this CD online used for like $9 and when I got it, it was the correct case/CD cover. However, when opening up the CD case it was discovered that I was sent a burned copy of a CD that was not even the CD I ordered. It was a random mix CD and was scratched up beyond repair. I ended up getting my money back instead of getting a new copy but who does that and thinks someone is going to be cool with that?"
4,Some great tracks off this album...,"I think it's obvious that disc 1 has better tracks, and is more well put together than disc 2, but disc 2 does have one of my favorite trance mixes in NO ONE ON EARTH. This album has some amazing tracks mixed with some just ok ones, but overall it hits the mark."
1,STAY AWAY - PURE CRAP !!,STAY AWAY FROM THIS !!!I COULDN'T BE ABLE TO READ THIS BLURAY IN ANY BLURAY PLAYER... THE MEDIA IS VERY CHEAP... THE QUALITY EVEN WORSE... SPEND YOUR MONEY IN SOMETHING THAT MATTER...A COMPLETE DELUSION !
3,History as it occured,"Is there a lot in here that's new? No. But the context is important. Here it isn't historical fact, it's breaking news. We hear how the police originally let the Oswald just walk past them out of the Book Depository because they were told by management he was ""supposed to be there."" One of the early rumors was that ""they"" -- the assassins -- were a man/woman duo. Oswald is identified as Lee Harold Oswald often. As he is being transported, you can hear the Dallas police speak proudly about how safe he is, and then boom, Oswald is killed, too, before our very eyes. I was touched, too, by how polite both Jackie and Rose Kennedy were, the very day of the murder. Jackie asks the priest to ""please pray for her husband."" Rose refers to LBJ as ""Mr. President"" and thanks him for his condolences. Amazing!"
3,Lacking Extended Content,"Having studied countless JFK materials, including video, I would prefer this particular presentation include more extensive (if possible) coverage of the president's last two days on earth; snippets of his Fort Worth, Texas speech, outside the Hotel, and after the breakfast gathering, certainly should have been much more complete.Also, the Dealey Plaza scenes did not include the fact that a police officer, post shooting, ran up the grassy knoll, thinking this particular area warranted investigation. Indeed, other citizens converged on the knoll area, for the same reason as the police officer, making me wonder why that bit of historical informaiton was omitted."
5,Amazing,"The Last JFK Tapes, The Assassination, from National Geographic is a fantastic documentary.Why? Because it has no modern Marxist opinionated historian's bias view points, or let's throw one out there...wait for it...""gun control"" or a right or left wing conspiracy theorists commentary. The entire video is straight from the televised, filmed, or recorded sources. A well done work NG."
5,Excellent compulation of film footage.,"This DVD is everything it was purported to be.Only about 20% of the footage was new to me, but I have studied the assaination since it happened.As Jack Webb used to say,....""just the facts Ma'mm "". No bias was inferred in any way.JB"
4,Left me wanting more,My husband is huge into the Kennedy Assassination and so this was a perfect gift for him for Christmas. We didn't want the DVD to be over when it finished. Excellent footage.
3,Buy - JFK: 3 Shots That Changed America - instead,"There is nothing here that isn't in the ""JFK: 3 Shots That Changed America"" dvdJFK: 3 Shots That Changed America DVD"
4,JFK Tapes,I ordered this because the VHS copy I have has locked up. The video quality is not good but that is because the original is probably not in good shape. I am still glad to have it though because the audio is good.
1,Love the old strike king models but they sent wrong ones,"The sunglasses are fine - but they are not the ones shown in the picture. I have been searching for this particular style of Strike King glasses - the ones with side windows in amber. I have had several pairs over the years and they are great for wide temple folks like myself, with excellent clarity too. Newer styles seem tight. I also like the amber lenses.So I order this model in amber and the pair sent to me are a completely different model. Smaller frame, smaller lense area, no side windows and to add insult to injury - they sent grey lenses instead of Amber.I'll end up keeping them - they fit my 9 year old very well. but I am bummed that what is shown is not what they actually have in stock.I am suspect that there are no older model ones available any more - the ones shown in the picture are the ones I use to buy 10 years ago."
3,Pretty good revenge movie with Oldman and Rhames,"This is a pretty good cop revenge movie. Ving Rhames asEddie Burns tracking down the thugs who raped his sister andsold as porn is great. Oldman as Charile Storm the old enemeyof Eddie whose out for his hide because of what he did to hisbrother is good too.Sure the movie isnt anything new but Rhames is hard to ignoreas is Oldman, the cop shoot scenes is played well and there issome good suspense especially with the info about Eddie'spartner who might be betraying him.Check out Sin."
3,"Interesting, but did not find it funny at all","Perhaps it is American vs. Canadian sense of humor, (i am in California) but i did not find this book at all funny. It is a poignant description of a dysfunctional family which is descriptive without being overwhelming with pain and sadness. It is a story of survival and not necessarily entertainment"
5,This book changed my life forever. The best book ever.,"When Hafif, finds himself lost in a world of misery he asks his master to help him, finding not only the way to succes but the way to get an entire hapiness. I read this book 20 years ago, and I still reading it It`s like my basic diet in everyday`s life."
2,Jump start advanced 4th grade,We have always used jump start games for our daughter. But this one failed to work properly. There seems to be a problem with 2 out of the 4 disk and they wont play. They do have a patch for the problem. But we have dial up and the patch takes over 2 hours to download. So I contacted them and they are sending me replacing disk. I'm glad they were very willing to correct this problem. Just be aware the disk do have problems.
2,"Okay, but not so tough","Fit and finish leaves something to be desired. Blade bent under moderate use. Would be okay for loose soil and light backyard gardening. I bought one because it was billed as a tough tool and department store trowels never cut it when uprooting plants of all sorts in my clay and root filled grounds. Maybe another brand would be tougher, and cheaper."
1,Not worth it and/or the price for it,"Well at least, some stuff is cool, free cam bag, the pics come out excellent. The video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard. Also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam. The adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining. The sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to ""freeze up"".Bottom line...I recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever. Its trash. Go for something else."
4,good for the price,does a decent job especially for the price I like the sd card I have a reader on my PC and just plug them in not a 500 dollar unit but I have filmed our racecar with it and burned it to a cd and it looks about like tv good enough for a memory booster
1,Biggest piece of junk,"I purchased this item for my son for Christmas last year. He was able to use the camera for video for a small amount of time due to the lack of internal memory. He then installed the memory card (recommended with the camera) and then the system would not turn on. It seems that the memory card slot was not designed well. Once you take out the card, the camera would work. We tested the card in another device and it worked properly. We sent the camera back to the manufacturer and they had it for about 10 days and sent it back with no problem found. We still cannot use the camera with the memory card in it. Do not buy!!!!!"
1,Crummy,This camera is cheap quality and doesn't produce good results. Invest in a real camera. Don't buy this one.
1,Possibly two stars... Maybe...,"The camera itself wasn't all that bad. The video quality was okay, the picture quality was fine. But it was the sound quality of the video that really threw me off. I got this as a Christmas present and loved it... Until I tried playing the video back. In a nutshell, it is nearly impossible to hear anything anyone is saying if they're further than 10 or less feet away, even when you download the video to the computer. So I thought to myself, why not just buy a microphone for it? Wrongo! I found out the hard way that it isn't possible to use a microphone with the camcorder.So, if you just want a camera to make music videos or other silent productions, I guess this is fine for that. But if you're looking for a decent quality video camera for school or home videos or short productions, I would CERTAINLY not reccomend this."
3,Not What I Expected,"When I purchased this item, I was expecting a video recorder that can also take still photographs. Instead it is a still camera with video recording capabilities. The product name is misleading.That does not mean that is a bad camera. In fact it is a great camera, if the user intends to use it primarily for still photographs. For video recording I would recommend something else. The resolution is only 640x480 and the results are heavily pixelated videos. The device also produces horrible monophonic sound recording."
4,Great camera for a great price,"This camera is outstanding for the price. Features are mimimal but if you just want to take email quality and archival videos, you'll be fine. Batteries run down quickly but check this out:YOU CAN GO ON EBAY AND GET NOKIA CELL PHONE BATTERIES FOR 5.00 WHICH ARE THE SAME AS THE ADVERTISED BATTERIES WHICH COST 30-50$ I recharge it using my DELL PDA charger and it holds a charge for several hours of taping. Hope this helps."
4,Pretty good,I used this for my Random Samster videos and its pretty handy...If you want to edit videos in Windows Movie Maker you have to save it as another format like WMV or MOV for macs... when you film have good lighting or else your video will be too dark..its also good for taking pics of course
5,summertime....,"great mix, feels very summertime....CD 1, fabulous tribal house, it's just rightCD 2, jazzy, funky, just an all around mellow mix, flowingCD 3, laid back loungey hip hop, semi underground style, real niceplus a creative CD layoutit's nice poolside..."
4,very helpful and useful,If your interested in West Virginia politics (or politics in general) you might find this book interesting and useful. James R. Forrester is a very well educated man with lots of experience in this field. He was my politics professor at West Liberty State College.
4,High adventure micro-style,"There are books here and there in which men and women are shrunk to the size of insects, and in that world they must try and survive. There aren't very many of these, though, and this one is probably the best. The insects feel real, and the measures the people use to survive have that real feel, too. The tribe of humans in this book are descended from a mysterious group called ""The Twelve"" that founded their city in the distant past. Where The Twelve came from and why humans are so different from the other animals all around them is something that is on their minds as they realize they have to move on and find a new settlement. Their quest is full of battles with ants, giant insects that are subdued with spider-venom tipped spears, and all of the stuff that makes great adventure. They do find some answers in the end, but I will leave the rest to the reader. I found the book engaging and well-paced, with all the giant bugs (or small humans) one could want."
1,ugh!,"This is pretty bad. Worst part is the lack of English subtitles for those German interviews. I was really looking forward to Klauss and Astrid, I don't speak German so, tough. Long sections of black on the screen, most likely just as filler. Don't bother, even if you are hard core."
2,Solid Idea but NOT Solid Construction,"I really liked the Idea of a hanging gift bag holder.I gave this product a 2 simply because I Love the idea...Sadly though before I even loaded it down with bags.. the hanger broke. You'd think the manufacturer would have though about this, I would have paid an extra $5 for a GOOD strong sturdy hanger for it. What I ended up doing was cutting a slit in the fabric along the bottom side of their hanger, removing the flimsy hanger it came with and inserting one of my own heavy duty hangers. It's lopsided now but it holds bags well.If I would have known about this, I would have at least looked for other brand names, first."
4,Gifts bags easy to find now!,This helped me organize about 40 bags and tissue in one place. Easy to see all the bags and tissue too.
4,gift bag organizer,This has been really helpful keeping me organized. I keep it in my closet so that it is out of the way. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars.... this could be me but I had a hard time figuring out where everything would fit like they have it displayed. I did give one to my daughter.
5,amazing,"I spent the first 10 years of my life in harlem, and the place just had a profound effect on me. We moved in the late 80's and I always wondered what happened to harlem...like their was a part that was missing. Harlem Diary, really takes a poignant look at young black people, showing the real ""us"" as a thoughtful and intelligent people, telling their own stories....it was moving"
3,"Entertaining, but not enough heat for me","I enjoyed the story, but there was not enough heat in this book for me.The book did hold my attnetion and it did answer several questions (if you are reading the series in order), but not enough sexual tention for me. I will continue to read the series, because it does have an interesting story line and characters. But they are becoming predictable. I hope the next book changes my mind"
5,Enjoyed the Story Line,I am truly enjoying the additional characters as well as getting to know the current ones. I can't wait for the new book to come out.
1,Where was the editor?,"It was hard for me to understand how this book could get past the editor's desk because of the very awkward translation from German to English. The subject matter seemed intriguing from the title (I ordered the book sight unseen) but was most disappointing. I have read probably hundreds of Holocaust books and this was pretty close to the bottom, as far as being worthwhile in any sense. There was no bibliography either, which is a necessity for any book of this type to be believable. I would not recommend it, and in fact will be soon donating it to a used book store."
2,"Interesting Premise, Lousy Book","The other reviewers are not being picky when they criticize this book's writing and/or translation. Most of us have read translated works before, but I would rank this one right at the bottom of quality. In fact, I think the translator may moonlight as a translator of Chinese operating instructions!But wait! Another reviewer here actually read this work in German and said the source material was poorly written! So now the fault lands on the editor's desk -- but was it the German editor or the English language editor?At any rate, this book is a missed opportunity. Fairly interesting (especially the 1959 articles), but could have been much more powerful and instructive."
2,disappointing,"It may be that the ebb and flow of this book was lost in translation. It is confusing and hard to read. I was thoroughly interested in the subject matter, but the writer seems to take for granted that the reader knows enough to fill in the large blanks."
2,Interesting Context; Very Poorly Written,"Editor please! If you took the context of this book and presented it in well-written form, it would be worth 4 stars; as it is, it is difficult to follow. Read only if you are very interested in the lives of a few of the children of notorious Nazis."
4,Euro Intrigue,"To be fair, this is a book written for European audiences, what I mean is that culturally they are different they tell stories in ways that aren't always compatible with the typical American thirst for non-stop action. This is a interesting character study of betrayal, one man's fight to find out why all the while taking you to European cities that are rich with culture. I enjoyed this book, it was paced as I expected and honestly I enjoy Euro fiction so it was right up my alley. Get it if you want a different look at what mystery and intrigue look like, think twice if your expect bombastic adrenalin soaked pages."
5,WOW,"If you want an eye opening, heart opener this is the book for you. One I will read again, and again, and again."
3,mind bogling,"This is a very interesting book, however, very difficult to understand. If your looking for something easier to digest, look elsewhere. The Tibetan book of living and dying by S. Ripoche is probably a better choice."
3,Neither satisifed nor dissatisfied,"The book arrived in good and never used condition, however, it seemed very old. And when I opened the cover, it immediately tore. But other than that I have no complaints."
4,a definate read for clint fans,"its a great book! i loved the the ""short"" tales from the indivuals. even though you wont admit it, you can definately find a piece of yourself in some of the stories. Let your mind open and enjoy this not so average world we live in."
2,Skip this album,"The only good thing about this album is the very first song ""Delirium"". I gave this two stars only because the first song is so good. The other songs fail to even come close. Do yourself a favor and buy the maxi-single of Delirium and don't waste your money on this entire album."
3,could be better,"This cd really has some exciting stuff. Its guitar is the highlight. However, it could be much better without those non-sense vocals."
2,"This is anything but ""euphoric"".","I read excellent reviews of the cd everywhere and based on the kind of music I like ""Euphoria"" was reccommended to me by a couple of people.However, the first impression that came to mind upon hearing this cd was that it sounded like ""Ambient-Country Music"" - I'm not kidding. Although I was told that the music beared some resemblences to Pink Floyd, I couldn't help but picture a couple of guys with electronic music equipment playing out in the middle of an Arizona dessert surrounded by cactus plants! The music was so dry it made me thristy and the vocals brought anything but coolness to the music, instead hindering it even more.Although the album isn't poorly crafted or anything, it is quite odd sounding and something doesn't quite blend well on here. Maybe because for me, ambient music should take me above the clouds, into space, deep into the ocean, or across the world to a far away land - not leave me in the middle of a barren dessert!"
2,"Buy the CD single, skip the album","After hearing the single, Delerium, at mp3.com I decided to pick up the whole CD. The CD is a disappointing attempt to meld various influences and only ends up sounding like so many ""new age"" albums: strangely soothing yet annoying. The comparisons to Pink Floyd are a HUGE stretch. The overly engineered reverbs and echoes become increasingly superfluous as the album wears on. The CD isn't terrible it's just that there's other CDs that are far superior. If you like the guitar-hypotic sound of this cd then try Michael Brook's Cobalt Blue (this is the man that invented the infinite guitar). If you like the more vocal/pop aspects then try Moorcheeba's Big Calm. If you like the more electronic side then there's Banco De Gaia. If you still want to try this CD then at least look for it in a used store first."
4,Good product,I am very sensitive to medicine/supplements. So far this is the only probiotic I have been able to take without issues. My stomach says thank you.
3,To many unhealthy seeds,"This is advertised as being healthy for the tiels, but has to many high fat seeds, such as sunflower seeds. The tiels tend to avoid the rest of the food and eat the sunflower seeds. These seeds are high in fat and not good for house bound tiels. Wild birds use a lot more energy and the high fat content won't hurt them."
4,excellent,brings a kind of foil very very hard! .. cost me my chewing ... but otherwise my cockatiles are like crazy! like! but these hard pieces and leave the grip on the floor
3,Expensive to use!,"The Purrforma plus has worked very well for us so far. Our cat loved it right away. However, it is very expensive to keep all the supplies you need on hand, and not all pet stores carry them. I estimate the cost per month to be about $15--NOT INCLUDING litter and electricity! Handy product, but definitely not a necessity."
5,"If you are passionate about the oldies, GET THIS CD!","LOVED IT! Enjoyed every song. If you are a big fan of Marvin & Tammi, this is a MUST-HAVE in your collection!!! :D"
4,Pretty Great Book!,"I'm always wary of stories that drag out the Big Misunderstanding premise. I mean, honey, if one can't talk over lil' matters even before the honeymoon, what will happen when the brats pop out along with the bills?Hence, I'm very delighted to say that ""Midnight Mistress"" is one jolly fun read with plenty of exciting adventures and yes, the romance's great too! The two main characters are perfect for each other despite her tendency to see every woman as his mistress and his tendency to pull an ""I'm Not Worthy"" act - indeed they have great chemistry and wonderful passion.Great plot, great characters, and a wonderful read all through the night. Now, if only the silly Big Misunderstanding is cleared earlier..."
4,Good exposure to Nordic Music,"A lot of people might describe this CD as ""mood music"" or New Age, which would be enough to send me running in the opposite direction. I prefer to describe it as a good anthology of contemporary Nordic music, reflecting some traditional elements. If you want to relax and bliss out to this CD you should have no problem, but if you enjoy complex, sophisticated music, you also will find this to be a most satisfying CD.My only quibble is a complete lack of liner notes. However, the CD does provide the various albums that these tracks came from, in case you want to hear more of a particular artist's music. Every track can be found on other CDs.If you are not familiar with many Nordic artists, then this will be a very useful CD to give you some exposure!"
4,Decent Read,"This isn't my favorite mysteries, but definitely a decent read. After reading this I see that I will continue reading the series.Susan Henshaw is a housewife and sleuth. She's got enough to do considering Christmas is so close, and her mother-in-law has just arrived (early by the way) with a phony health doctor who comments on everything they eat. Soon Susan's friend Kelly Knowlson (a woman obsessed with her ex-husband) who gets accused of killing Evan (her ex-husband), when he turns up missing.Will Susan be able to solve the case, get Kelly off the hook, and have a good Christmas before it's too late?This is a great book for the holidays. There are a lot of rich, gossipy women, who seem like a bunch of backstabbers, but the mystery is okay."
3,Five Stars,I have enjoyed LW111 for years. He is a great song writer and a great singer. This is just one of his great albums.
2,Loudon Cleans His Attic,"A truly pedestrian effort, this album is composed of topical tunes whose time has past. This collection would have been better left unrecorded."
3,Acoustically and Visually Transparent,"Bought this material for my JBL L150A's. Color was accurate as compared to the picture, and the material was easy to cut and work with. I used a fabric adhesive that recommended letting it dry and get tacky before fastening the fabric down, and I can recommend this method as it worked well. The only thing I wasn't ready for is that the material is not only acoustically transparent, but is also visually transparent. The drivers in the JBL's have silver-colored frames, and the woofers have white cones, and both the housings and cones show through this material. Perhaps the black or brown material is not visually transparent, but this gray color allows the drivers to be visible."
3,Not sure it's doing anything,"We bought the filter at the recommendation of our allergist. We bought it for our bedroom to try to cope with my nighttime nasal stuffiness. We had already removed the rug. After owning it a year, we haven't seen any dust accumulation on the inner stage 2 filter.On the other hand, our central air/heat filter--where we've installed a top of the line filter--may be taking all the work away from junior, so I can't say for sure whether the fault lies with the filter.In other words, it may be that if you've already put a quality inline filter in the central system, this portable filter is redundant.I'm now investigating a humidifier (my son swears by it), and I've started using a neti pot (nasal saline rinse from what looks like a little tea pot). Neither of these were on the allergist's recommended environmental steps to take list. My recommendation: try these two things first."
4,Beware all cults!,"For anyone who doesn't know how insidious a cult can be in drawing people in, reading this memoir will surprise them. The Moonies carefully target young people, often travelers carrying backpacks.Drawn in by the friendly offer of a meal, the person who invited them sticks to the victim like a hovering bee... Encouraging then to go to other meetings, then weekends, where the activities gradually increase the pressure to join the cult.It surprises somewhat to find how thoroughly the author was at times held in thrall to beliefs some part of him continued to resist. One wishes him well when after ten years he finally breaks free to fashion his own life.A bit repetitive at times, but one trusts the accuracy of the author's depiction and wants to read on."
5,Incredible Story! Wow!,"Wow! Heartbreak and Rage: Ten Years Under Sun Myung Moon by Gordon Neufeld is an incredible story! He gives a wonderful and honest account of his years as a Mooonie! I believe this book will help many, many people."
4,He gave them every chance to change,"A thorough and honest look into the recruitment, conversion, day-to-day (exhausting) lifestyle, and the slow, painful walk away from total devotion to the Unification Church. Gordon Neufeld makes it easy to understand how one is recruited and how difficult it is to ever succeed inside a coercive group. He showed incredible perseverance and willingness to be a faithful follower but the group refused to see its foibles and change. Throughout the book one can see how the group pressure to conform and perform left followers too exhausted and with too little self-esteem to object. Mr. Neufeld introduces mind control and provides a brief description."
4,Excellent reading,My son and I enjoyed this book today. The story was engaging and the drawings were cute. Nice lesson on how respect wins respect. I recommend this for 3 yr old children and up.
5,Different Wild Animals,"Anabel and Nettie are two opposite old boars. The author's use unusual animals but the story is very creative and dissuades one from being rude to others. In this book, the nice one finishes first and the bad one finishes last."
5,A finely tuned understated masterpiece.,"Simply put, this one of McCartney's shining moments; ""Tug Of War"" takes it's standing alongside of ""Sgt. Pepper"", ""Abbey Road"" and ""Band On The Run"" as a fully realised work of a true rock artist. The opening title track is a soaring symphonic statement of longing and remorse, and this theme is central to the album. The theme of struggle, and the resigned inevitability that we do in fact live in a world of opposites with all it's attractions and repulsions is handled with the customary tunefulness and understatement characteristic of McCartney's best work. Here he shows why he is in fact a great writer; intelligent and mature, while not proslytizing. A stylistically diverse alsum, ranging from the great ballad ""Someone Who Cares"""" to the funk duet with Stevie Wonder ""What's That You're Doing?"" to the barrelhouse eccenctric rocker ""Ballroom Dancing"". You can't go wrong here, pop music doesn't get any better...well, maybe the ""White Album""."
4,very catchy but very stupid lyrics thats all you need is,"i never listened to this album in a long decadeos so but those very stupid lyrics with some meaningof life thats all it takespluss catchy cord prog. at its bestthat all you need for love of the music buisnessworld & paul figured this out at a very earleyage of youth evey time you listen to his songwill take you back to straberry fields foreveror is that johnhappy birthday your birthday will always remainin my heart and spiritwondelust is still pounding in my mindif i got one left ????thanks pauli heard war is hell but not listing to thistitlefrom 2000,man Bri"
2,Weak material,"I read the reviews and went straight to buy this album. What a dissapointment! I would recommend to skip this one, except for Here Today, maybe my favourite song of his after the Beatles. If this song ever surfaces on a compilation, get that and forget about this one. Any other of his records from the 90's is better than this one."
5,One Of The Better SOUNDING CDs You'll Hear,"The star of the show here is George Martin. While this is a better than typical Paul album, the sound is beautiful and can fill up your entire room. A great listening experience and a clinic on excellent production!"
4,Reliving the experience....,"Browsing through the reviews I decided to put this cd on again. It's definitely one of Paul's better albums basically because it's one of his more personal ones. You get the feeling he's writing about his relationship with John in the title track as well as the song 'Here Today.' 'Wanderlust' is another personal experience which resonates even greater than the terrific melody and lyrics when you know the story behind the song. In a lot of ways it's a 'smaller' album and less commercial than many McCartney albums. And that's a good thing for those of us who thought 'For No One' was a better song than 'Obladi-Oblada'. Produced by the true 'fifth Beatle', George Martin."
5,"Adapters, can always use more adapters",Nothing is more frustrating that to not be able to charge the grandkids toys while on a trip. Now I have assorted adapters that will fit most every battery device.
4,watch your back,"What I found most interesting about the book is the description of the appalling research culture at the NIH. This is after all the world's best funded and perhaps the world's leading biomedical research institution at least in quantity of output if not in quality. The book makes it more than clear that the institution was aware, tolerated, and at times rewarded research ethics that stink to high heavens. The possibility that the likes of Gallo and his supervisors may have influenced a generation of scientists is truly appalling. Never having worked at the NIH itself I find it now much easier to comprehend the behavior and the social norms of my NIH trained colleagues. I therefore highly recommend to anybody planning to work at NIH or having to work with alumni of this institution."
5,8th Grade STudents love this,Why wouldn't you use this when teaching middle school students about Shakespeare? The language is easy to understand while still having the original verbiage on the opposite side of the book. Great option when teaching Shakespeare!
2,The Tempest,The No Fear Shakespeare edition of 'The Tempest' is a bastardization of the Shakespearian language and gives an erroneous idea of what W. Shakespeare actually meant. (The format is Shakespearian English on page one and 20th century english on page two.) I believe the No Fear version actually changes meaning of the original several times. I would stay away from this edition.Linda Sheean
3,Penn-Elcom G0727KIT Plastic Grill Clamp Kit,I purchased two sets for a Waffel Grill pair on a 2 Way speaker project and the provide the means to mount the Grill just outside the diameter of the speaker surrounds.
5,Brilliant!!!,This Toy is amazing! He is very detailed and his wand is amazing.Hedwig is incredible.It looks as though she has just delivered Harry a letter.He goes perfectly well with Gryffindor Ron and Gryffindor Hermione.I highly reccomend it to any fans of the books and movie.
3,"Good on networks & data, too detailed on old protocols","The early chapters give a good grounding in networking and IP. Voice coding is covered and is clear. A little to much emphasis on outdated protocols and the history behind the evolution of data transportation methods. Good references are made to the ITU standards, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and similar bodies. These provide a good link for further reading and investigation."
1,Please do not waist your money...,"I bought it, read it and I was really dissapointed. If you want to have a deeper knowledge in Voice over Ip maybe this book will not help you."
1,Thieves,"The people who made this movie just stole your money. Do not rent or buy this garbage. I think they may have been high on drugs and made this movie in an afternoon. It is worse than bad, it is criminal that Amazon allows them to actually take your money for this. It is rank theft."
1,Buying this movie was a Grave Mistake,"While I do have a fondness for Zombie movies, this move was the worst! Bad acting, bad story and lousy Zombies. If I had it to do over, I would not take this movie if it was free."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a very long time.,"It was very amateurish to say the least. It was like some college student created a movie as a school project, using friends and family as the cast. The characters, acting and plot were terrible. I found myself fast-forwarding through the second half of the movie. It was that bad. The movie was not scary. It was not funny either.I must admit though, it took guts for the producers and actors to put their names in the credits at the end of the movie. I would have been too ashamed to own up to this pathetic mess."
2,Horrible!,"I got this as part of the midnight horror collection set, that i bought for 5.00, and it has 4 movies so i was not that mad when it sucked. I watched it with family and we laughed a a few scenes, and there was also a few cool FX/kills but overall it sucked! The picture was blurry, the acting was terrible, and the zombies sucked. I would have given this move 2 stars but i see some people gave it 5 so to balance it out ill give it one. 95 min. , color, Widescreen(so big its almost full screen) , not rated- Violence/Profanity. Overall 1 - 2 Stars,this is bad but Believe me there are worse!!"
1,Lid Too Big,"Lid is advertised as being for the 12 1/2 inch saute pan, but it is too large. It may be a replacement lid for the 4.5 quart saute pan. It should be advertised correctly."
5,Suspense! Intrigue! Surprises! Happy Endings!,"If you enjoy all of these elements in your books, then you'll enjoy Candy.Can anyone cope with as many problems as Candy is faced with? Is there really a man as wonderful and understanding as Johnny Knight? And can any human being be as horrible as JD Cooper?Find out for yourself. Read Candy. You'll love. You'll hate. You'll cry. And you'll be glad you read the book. It's a story you won't soon forget.Then, be sure and read the sequel, Candy2."
5,Great!,"My 10 year old daughter chose this book, and she loves it! The author's review is very accurate. Kids of different skill levels of drawing will enjoy this book and get a lot out of it. Mine is not an artistically ""gifted"" child - but she is happy with her new ability to make her drawings look like horses! Children who love to draw and will spend a lot of time on a drawing will appreciate ALL the wonderful tips and hints to draw and style the horses. The format is friendly - and even if she doesn't ""do"" all the details herself (the different braided manes, pairings of horses etc) mine LOVES looking at the pictures and having the simple and clear explanations. Highly reccomended!"
2,"I TRIED to like it, I really did!","After reading some of the 5-star reviews for this book, I was really looking forward to it. I love books by Ann Rivers Siddons, Dorothea Benton Frank and others, so I was hoping I'd found yet another author to enjoy. To be honest, for the first 10 chapters or so, I did. However, after a promising beginning, the story just plain ""bogs down."" It's very rare that I just give up on a book, but I have to admit that with this one, I did. For a book that began with such promise, it slowly, but inevitably becomes ponderous, and just plain boring. I honestly can't tell you if ends with a satisfying conclusion or not, because after plowing through this muck for several days, I just didn't care about the characters any more. Such a shame, because it could have been a really good story."
2,Long-winded,I downloaded this book for free and would have been very disappointed had I spent any money on it. It started out with an interesting plot but quickly became extremely long-winded. I didn't realize that it would have such an extremely Christian core message and theme. It almost became a chore to finish.
2,Good for high school aged girl or people from Atlanta,"I found the book tolerable, but it did not captivate me. Mary Swan rings hollow in her teen angst except in her early grief for her mother. I was not that interested in the contrived situations and responses of the characters and would have stopped reading a hundred or so pages into the story, but finished since my book club had selected this to read. We all felt our teenaged daughters would enjoy this story. I can see where some women from the south with ties to Atlanta society might also enjoy it. It was not my cup of tea, but I have several friends to whom I plan to lend the book expecting they will like it better."
2,SHOULD BE LABELED AS A CHRISTIAN NOVEL.,I DO SUGGEST THAT THE AUTHOR CATEGORIZE THIS BOOK AS A CHRISTIAN NOVEL. THAT WAY HER READERS CAN CHOOSE TOREAD A NOVEL WITH A STRONG RELIGIOUS THEME. (OR AVOID IT)
2,Had a lot of potential,"It should have been more forthright in its description. This book ended up being about ""the benefits"", as perceived by some, of becoming a Christian. The book was really just a very strong religious message to those interested in Christianity. The book would have been much better exploring more deeply the racial strife at that time OR exploring the lack of ability to treat depression. While it did address those issues - the message was loud and clear - YOU must become a Christian. There was NO consideration of diversity in that message."
5,Outstanding!,"I read this book because a dear friend recommended it. I am so glad she did because this is a book that touched me. Having grown up in Georgia I was very familiar with the crash that occurred in Paris. I was too young to understand the impact of the loss to Atlanta and the families involved but this book made me part of it. Ms. Musser drew me into the story immediately and held me tightly until the very end. In fact, I did not want the book to end.....I crave more.If you have not read this book I encourage you to get it NOW and read it. It is one of the best books I have ever read."
3,guess I'm reading a different book,"Yes it's touching, Yes it tells of a different era in time very well. However it is filled with alot of filler. Spoiler alert: The problem I have with is that the begginning after her mother dies the author includes every news paper article Mary reads. Yes we know her mother dies, yes we know Atlanta mourns but geez after about the 20th article (and these are full articles!!!) about how Atlanta is greaving it kinda gets old. I think she used a lot of this and other stuff just to fill up the pages. Other than the filler it is a wonderful book but I could knock out quite a few pages and won't be reading it again. Thank Goodness it was a free download at the time."
3,Good story but too much repetition,"This was a wonderful story and I really enjoyed it. I wish it had been a little more tightly written as some parts became repetitive and I found myself thinking, ""Okay, I've got; can we please move along?"" That being said, I still believe the story was worth my time. I was just a small child at the time (early 60's) and a northerner so I was affected by racial prejudice in a much different way. It was interesting to learn what people in the south dealt with...how they felt and coped."
4,Heartwarming,"The Swan House was a very inspiring read. I live in Metro Atlanta and knew places that were mentioned and felt 'at home'. There was only one aspect of the book that I didn't agree with, but it truly doesn't interfere with the way the characters become real. A good read."
2,The Swan House,Seemed as if it was written for pre-teen girls. Kind of corny. I also disliked the black language vernacular -- very amateurish.
2,Nyisha,"It may be because I'm not from Atlanta, but I found this book a bit boring. I feel like you needed a specific connection to the place in order to appreciate the story? Or maybe the story just wasn't interesting enough for me. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. Also, just FYI there is a significant amount of religious talk in this book. That was unexpected, so I just thought I'd share."
3,Great plot....poor writing,"Part fiction, part non-fiction, this novel is loosely based on a tragic plane crash that took place in the 1960's. It's about a young girl, now motherless, and her coming of age in Atlanta during the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. While the plot is very griping, the writing is terribly poor. Elizabeth Musser's sing-song simplistic dialogue doesn't allow the formation of deeply compassionate characters which this story deserves."
5,great read!,"This was a great read! I grew up in Atlanta during the '60's in the same area of Atlanta as the character in the book, as well as the area the author lived.(I attended the ""other"" private school just down the road she mentions in the story!)Elizabeth writes from a point of view one could only do having been there or knowing someone who had. I kept feeling I was experiencing ""deja vu"" with every page I turned.When I read about Mary Swan going to the High Museum and seeing the J.J.Haverty Collection it was too much! I too went as a young girl and viewed the same collection with my mother, who was also an artist--""Mr. J.J."" was my great grandfather!If anyone wants to know what Atlanta was like back then, this is a great and very enjoyable resource of historical fiction. An interesting side note - The author writes that she is married to a protestant minister and has two sons named Andrew and Christopher. Same here!""Deja vu"" again!"
5,Musser Weaves Atlanta History with Sensitive Creativity,"Swan House is a novel that I defintely did not want to end. Elizabeth Musser creates respect, passion, and compassion for both Atlanta's history and Mary Swan's story. The characters are genuine and believable. And after I saw the documentary film about the 1962 Orly Airport crash--THE DAY ATLANTA STOOD STILL, I had even more admiration and yes, some envy for Musser's creative weaving. She writes the kind of story I would like to tell."
3,Showed promise...,"This book would have been great if it had been about 100 pages shorter. So many places just dragged. Good story, good charcters, loved learning about Atlanta...so all in all not a bad read. BUT if you are not a fan of Christian books this is not for you."
5,Good Read,Swan House was highly recommended to me by friends. It's a great book. Mentions many places that I am familiar with.
3,"I love the cookware, but there are a few issues......","My name is Michael Walsh and I purchased the 15 piece T-Fal cookware set. I have overall been quite happy with the product except for the 8"" fry pan. The coating on this must have been defective because everything sticks to it. No matter how much I wash it and try to get the grime off, things like eggs and steak stick to the pan and make it very hard to clean. When I finally have it clean and it looks perfect, the non-stick properties still are absent. I really like the product, but would have expected a recall notice. None of the other pans or pots have this problem, but unfortunately I used the 8"" pan more frequently than the others due to it's perfect size. I would not discourage anyone from getting the cookware, but I would do some research beforehand on possible defects. I e-mailed the company and they never responded.Sincerely yours,Michael WalshSciuate, Massachusetts."
3,not as advertised,"The informmation says leather upper, but when I got them, the enitre boot is of man-made materials. Other than that, I do like them and they are probably an okay value for the price."
4,Must have for fans of Gorillaz and Animation.,"Very happy with this DVD, but grew a little wary of Interface. Luckily there is a straight forward mode where you can just view the content without exploring.The storyboard modes, visual content, and all the goodies you can find in this DVD makes it a must have for Gorillaz and Animation fans."
3,boring...,perfect for an addicted-til-death fan but got boring for me...i got this for christmas and i watched it for about 3 hours and then it's been at the bottom of my dresser door ever since...
3,"May be low, but i'm not high","Still think it's worth it and 3 stars may be a bit low, but I wanted a little more music, less 'extras'. Not to bash it though, cuz the what..4 vid's that play in 5.1 in the beginning and are done in succession (don't have to hit play on every one), were certainly worth the amazon price.And when I have kids that get into my collection doing stuff I've told 'em is bad for 'em, they might just spend the effort to drift around it and show me stuff I never saw."
5,it was a gift for my neice,my niece received it it time for her birthday. When she opened it She could hardly contain her joy!! although I was not able to be there she was very happy with this DVD. Thanks Amazon!!!
3,"Not bad if you like your coffee black, but not great either","I give this three stars because it keeps the coffee warm, and when I first got it, it made pretty decent coffee. Unfortunately, the press part has stopped reliably staying put at the end of the plunger, and so it often doesn't depress fully--the plunger depresses all the way, and the press slips. In addition, if you want to add either milk or sugar to your coffee AND drink it from your travel mug, you should get a different sort of travel mug. It hadn't occurred to me before I bought it, but not only is adding milk to the coffee difficult w/ this mug, it ends up tasting odd, perhaps because of the press, or because of the grounds still in the mug. So, if you drink your coffee black, like the french press method, and are willing to take your chances with the plunger on this, it may be worth the money. I wouldn't get it again."
1,Good Concept.,"I love coffee made with the French press method, so I thought this travel press would be great. It was for 3 days. The lid's threads were stripped in 3 days."
1,Heed these reviews!,"I had read the reviews and still ordered this cup. The first one we received, the pop top was broken. The second one lasted a week before the screw top wouldn't stay on anymore.Really disappointed, especially considering the price."
1,Consider before purchase:,"This is supposed to be a travel mug. The closure for the drinking lip attaches to the mug lid with a tension, two bar slip in slot. In three weeks of daily use the closure came off at least three times per day and finally is lost. A minor bump dislodges the closure. I wasted my money."
2,Bodum Travel Press,"I owned the older version of Bodum's travel press and loved it, so thought I would get the one of the newer ones. I, too, have had nothing but problems with it sealing. In fact, I thought it was a defect of the one I ordered, returned it for another one, and still have the same problems. Most of the time, the lid pops off and I get hot liquid all over me. I love the concept, but this particular design is not good."
1,"Same problem, threads stripped!","I have had the same problems everyone else has described. After only two uses, the threads on the mug's lid were stripped."
2,Nice Concept / Poor Performance,I have had nothing but problems with the way this mug seals. The threads are insufficient when it comes to securing the lid in place. Many times I have been carrying the mug and had the lid come loose spilling hot coffee all over myself and the carpet.
3,"Great tools, fragile box","The tools inside of the box are a great step up from chubby tools - they look a lot more like dad's. The tool box latch broke the first day we gave it to him, what a disappointment!"
2,"Good idea, cheap plastic","When I got this a few days before Xmas the plastic toolbox was broken on the bottom, so not top quality. The tools are ok, but are so cheap you cant actually do anything with them. There is hard plastic that feels brittle, and soft plastic that bends so pretending to hammer something might break the actual hammer. For what I would guess is .25 in plastic the charged lie 15 dollars and slapped Home Depot's name on it. Buy some wooden play tools they feel better and will last longer."
2,Cheap & flimsy box.,The box broke in no time & most of the tools have fallen apart as well. You are better off getting a small tool box & some old tools that actually work. A waste of money.
5,big hit with my grandsons~~,"very educational, and durable!!! GREAT PRODUCTm when they opened these at Christmas they played with these for hours,it is January and they are NOT bored with it!!!AMAZING also I like it because they are easily cleaned up!!"
3,nothing special...,"this wasn't a good buy in my opinion. Just your average , plastic tools. I really wish they had put screws in for the flat head screw driver because my son knows Phillips and flathead and he keeps looking for the Flat head screws lol, there are none.."
5,Great fun,"We previously owned the VHS, but we recently got rid of our TV and DVD/VCR combo and only watch movies on our desktop computer. We could only go a few months before we really wanted to watch this again. It's a fun, modern, Mormon spin on Austen's classic novel."
3,Moves too fast,"Disappointing. The film relied too much on a knowledge of the book. There is virtually no real character development. You are given the characters, several beautiful shots of the actress playing Lizzie, all the standard oft-filmed English manor homes and country gardens, vingnettes that lead to the denouement, and very little else. The A&E/BBC rendition staring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth gives greater latitude to character development and the more natural movement of the plot. This film just seems to jump from one key moment to the next. Even the old 1939 film staring Lawrence Olivier and Greer Garson, which was also filmed for a two hour viewing, was able to provide a greater sense of rational character and plot movement."
4,I liked it!,"I really liked this adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Instead of Elizabeth living with her sisters, she lives with college roommates with the same names and similar personalities. I thought the idea was clever, and there are definetely some amusing parts, but I have to admit aside from the 2 main characters the acting isn't spectacular. It is a great story though, and definetely worth watching!"
4,Humorous Adaptation!,"This filmatic adaptation of Jane Austen's classic is certainly one for all fans to check out. Set in modern time, yet faithfully following the novel, Pride and Prejudice is a mix of quirky dialogue, and hilarious mishaps. What I found the most interesting is how referential the movie is to not only the novel, but to Bridget Jones' Diary, and the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. The fight scene between Wickham and Darcy, and Elizabeth's taking comfort in food are direct refrences to Briget Jone's diary, and at the end of the movie there is a scene where Elizabeth is in the estate which was filmed as Pemberly in the BBC version. Although the acting was not always great, and some of the pink, candy colored decor often became blinding, the movie is a must see, and gives a sly wink to all Pride and Prejudice fans."
2,Pride and Prejudice DVD,"An okay movie, if you are a true Jane Austen fan you will appreciate the attempt in making a modern day P+P, but be very disappointed. The movie was all out of order, they had Darcy asking Lizzy out way to early in the movie. Things just seemed to out of sync. Even the brief ""qoutes"" from the book before they went the next scene jumped all around. There just wasn't enough tension built up between Darcy and Elizabeth. Even the characters they had all mixed up. I understand some liberty must be taken, but you will find yourself asking - why won't this movie just end. You get your romantic ending which makes it worth the rental, but definatley not the purchase. My local video store actually ordered it for me just so I could rent it. My suggestion is to stick with the original 1995 production of P+P by A+E w/ Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."
4,Austen Addict,"I thought this movie was a valentine from years past. Okay, it wreaks havoc on the novel. I really missed Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Still, I believe the LDS overtones perfectly echo Austen's resolute blind eye to the excesses of her time. The ending was totally over the top, but rendered almost believable by the acting of the leads"
1,Awful,"I thought this was a horrid rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"". The lead actress was terrible. She can't act. I nearly fell asleep trying to watch this. THey should have stuck to the traditional telling of the tale, or at least gotten someone who has the slightest bit of talent. Complete waste of time."
1,Terrible adaptation and even worse acting!!!!,"I was horrified by this movie!!! To take a great Jane Austen classic and turn it into a community theatre project is just wrong. The classical story was taken and ripped apart by the god-awful person that adapted it, and the actors...I can't even write this review I am so ashamed!!! I can't honestly say I have never in all my life seen such a pathetic attempt by so-called thespians. I will say the only exceptions to this insult are the two lead characters that play Darcy and Elizabeth: they have their moments. When you see this you will find yourself thinking..wow, Gigli was better!"
1,"Horrible, horrible adaptaion.",I finished this movie downright angry that I had wasted my time. I'm still so flustered with how bad it was I am at a loss to describe it.
1,fun for young girls; slumber-party stuff,"Certainly unimpressive but harmless piffle, with a weak weak script and annoyingly poor acting by all but the adorable elizabeth, darcy, & jane. Intentionally and winningly candy-colored and with old-fashioned (literally but not overwhelmingly Mormon) morality, this is a sweet movie for little girls, very slumber-party; with a positive spirit and strict, retro sexual ethics, but with pretty pom-pom hair bows, etc... parents can feel confident their girls will be safely and happily occupied. But parents and those old enough to be them shouldn't subject themselves."
1,B Movie Pride & Prejudice,"This is an incredibly badly acted movie. There are long scenes where nothing really happens. As a Janeite, I love all things Austen, but I will never rewatch this movie. The only way to enjoy it is for the B movie campiness. Character development and motivation are totally lacking."
1,Whoa that was really bad,"I am such a huge fan of P&P; so I wanted to see other adaptations. I purchased this dvd.Man oh man.This movie was so bad, but I watched the whole thing hoping something might redeem it. Didn't happen. The acting was horrible and cringe-worthy. There was no chemistry between any characters. The story was so cheesy. I rated it a 1 star because there was no option for 0 or negative stars.As far as the dvd quality goes, I was unimpressed. It skipped during a few scenes. Under set-up I selected English subtitles, but nothing showed up when I played the movie.Please save your money and don't buy this."
4,squeaky clean modern P&P,"For starters, this really is a comedy version of P&P.; At 104 minutes, some of the P&P; plot had to be cut and obviously this is a revisionist and modern look at Austen's work. It is smart, witty and clean enough to be a family film. It might make men groan, but, as a chick-flick and a movie you can watch with a tween daughter, this film works.Do not expect well-developed characters, because they are not here. The characters that remain in this film are portrayed in comical ways (i.e. Bingley's clothes & comments, Elizabeth's clumsiness under stress, Lydia's husband-hunting obsession). Do not expect erudite, and you will not be disappointed."
5,Funny and cute,"So maybe they didn't stay exactly true to the exact storyline. It's certainly a lot more true to the story than You've Got Mail or Bridget Jones' Diary. To set it in modern times and keep it less than two hours, I think it kept pretty close in the end. At least they stayed true to all the characters... Anyway, I thought it was really funny. I'm sending one to my sister for Christmas!"
1,Truly A Stinker,"My five-year-old tried to watch this movie with me and gave up after 5 minutes, telling me to watch the movie & tell her what happened. I wish I had done the same thing. This movie was SO LAME!!! There was no character development, the couples ended up together just because the story put them together, no because of any attraction or chemistry. Elizabeth comes off as an arrogant, shallow, feminist and her ""sisters"", or roomates in this version, are poorly sketched mockeries of the originals in the novel. Not one of the men was remotely attractive, exception being Mr. Darcy, and it's a huge point that the girls go to church but no one else in their group does. I laughed one time in the entire movie, and spent the rest of the time waiting for it to get better. The overall effect is so bland and goodhearted, you wonder why any of the couples end up together other than the need to go forth and procreate. Major waste of time and couldn't recommend it at all."
1,There should be more pride ...,"I am a devoted Jane Austen and P&P; fan, so the idea of setting the plot in our time was quite appealing to me until I saw the film.The idea was good, the film ... not really. They could have done better I think. Orlando was a sexy Mr Darcy, but a better film could have done him more credit. Concerning Elizabeth I do not think there was any life, energy and freshness in the character or in the actress (as U like it).There were very few original ideas as to how the plot should work and the characters should act among modern circumstances, they should have been more detailed. Elizabeth's driving a Beetle is fine but it was only one detail among many that could have been more elaborated.There were some funny scenes, but altogether it's a weak, sometimes truly boring film, neither the actors nor the crew did any credit to Jane Austen or her fans."
5,Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!,"Love the pan, the center is so cool, because you can tell when the product is pre-heated.....the center changes and it is so great. The pan is almost too big, but it is perfect for everything I can possibly cook in it!"
3,Good,"Christoper was Gary Lucas' first band, and this is their 1969 albumBasically this is blues, and not bad: one long jam that opens Watcha Gonna Do that has some great guitar work, and other tracks in a slightly psychedelic 12-bar style--lots of fuzz guitar, typical of 1969 acid rock. The problem is, there were a million bands doing this type of music in '69, and there are few elements that make this music stand out.Except for on ""The Great Clock,"" a non-12 bar but bluesy track about the inevitable-not taxes--that has inventive echo percussion to simulate a clock's ticking.Lucas went on to far more progressive work, first in a later version of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, and in the 1990s, producing the late Jeff Buckley."
2,Melloni's Pocket Medical Dictionary,"This dictionary is a deception in size not content, the information it offers is great. However, if you are a nurse or healthcare professional looking for a pocket reference this is ""NOT"", your dictionary....the book's author should remove the the term, ""POCKET"" this book is larger in size and length than the Taber's Medical Dictionary, there is nothing ""pocket"" about this book. Buyer beware, I was so disappointed when I saw the size of the book, I hope this helps someone about to purchase this item based on size."
3,Too fragile,Be careful handling this. I mean VERY careful! I was holding the handle while drying it and the pot cracked a bit near the bottom seam of the handle. This was after owning 3 days and using it 4 times. I was very disappointed because I loved it and Bodum doesn't make replacement glass tea pots.
2,"Random, light on content, still enjoyable","This documentary had the oddest organization. The narrative is made up of snippets of information/opinions woven together in a mostly incoherent way. Pretty videos, though. Just wish the presentation had been given more thought and structure."
2,No Depth,"Condors, cougars, sea lions and otters. There is sooooo much more to Big Sur than what this weak documentary presented. No history, no geology, no seasonal explanation. Yes, the cougars are cool and the condor is big, but this wilderness is so much more complex than this repetitive, shallow, ""show"" had to offer."
2,No Title,This was bought as a gift; however it did not show the beautiful scenery at Big Sur. I have been to Big Sur and it has beautiful scenery that this DVD leaves out.
2,"I wish I had paid closer attention to the words ""Wild California.""","It came today and I was excited. My wife and I are going to Big Sur later this summer. We were there once before; but didn't have time to explore. I thought through this video, I could get a head's up on the area. I was going to surprise my wife by showing it to her tonight.Man!!!! Why don't they call it ""Wild California.....big sur."" Sea otters are cute; but not for half of it. Also tons of time spent on condors.I really should have read ""Bold Consumer's"" review more carefully. It's my fault really. I was hoping to see information on lodging, restaurants, Nepenthe, Pfeiffer Park. You know....... the beauty of the place. Not who kills who.I'll pay more attention to reviews next time. Show me the cliffs and the waves."
2,ehhh,"A case with a screen cover is a must for any ipod, but it kind of defeats the purpose when it makes it next to impossible to read the screen itself. The case is rubber and knobby so its got great grip, it won't fall off a dashboard, but that also means that it attracts dust like crazy. So between that and the inevitable air bubbles on the screen cover it sort of negates the usefullness of the overall product."
2,"Unusual, somewhat pretentious.","The two reviews immediately below are typical of the type of snobby and pretentious attitude that is unfortunately all too common among the fans of Stockhausen. If you enjoy the pose of misunderstood avant-garde music, this is for you.Apparently the score makes some unusual demands of the performers, such as ""Live alone for four days without food."" Why? Who knows? My guess would be that this, like much in Stockhausen's music, is simply there for the purpose of making the score as unusual as possible. (A good example is his Helicopter quartet, which requires the players in the quartet to perform their parts in separate air born helicopters, unable to hear each other.)"
1,Difficult to read & comprehend,I bought this book after seeing a few positive reviews on the Internet. I found it very difficult to read & comprehend. The first few pages were filled with questions from the authors. It seemed as though one page had over 50 question marks on it.Because the book seemed to be more about the author's questions about life than about Hinduism; I only glanced at the first few pages and put the book back in my bookshelf.
3,Very Hard Game,"Okay, so I purchased this game in the early 90's. It is very difficult. Not as difficult as BATTLE TOADS, but still, it is a hard game to beat. After so many years of leaving it in boxes (because I gave up) I finally pulled the game out and played it again. (12 years later)I have to say, with determination I beat this game. I beat it 2 times after watching someone on youtube conquer it. This is a one player game, and when you finally get to play as the X-men & Spiderman the game gets hard. Use every hint and skill that you find.Over all it is enjoyable, but it's very frustrating."
1,Air crashes,This book isn't as good as I thought. I would rethink it if you're thinking about buying it. Boring is all I can say.
3,Not what you think,I have to agree with the other review that this is a bit misleading. It's not so much a narrative on past crashes as it is an educational piece on subjects you may already understand.
2,Misleading,"I WAS EXPECTING A COMPILATION OF ACCIDENTS AND A REVIEW OF THEIR CAUSES, INSTEAD I GET A TON OF DEFINITIONS OF WEATHER TERMS AND AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENTS WHICH I DO NOT NEEDVERY DISSAPOINTING AND BORING BOOK WHICH WAS A SURPRIZE AS I ENJOY THE AUTHORS ARTICLES IN FLYING MAGAZINE"
5,didn't expect to like it,"I consider myself advanced working out mostly with Cathe, Patrick, Michelle Dozois, Paul Katami, Art of Strength, and the like. I did not expect to like this one much. But to my surprise it was one tough and time-efficient bootcamp style circuit workout of about 35 minutes including warmup and cool down with a one-time 2 minute rest between the two chapters which is welcome. The emphasis is on weights but most of it is compound exercises and gets your heart rate way up. It was well cued and very challenging. In a fairly short period of time it gives you a tough total body workout. It's a keeper!"
1,Dont buy it,"I really wanted to like this program but the exercises don't match up with PDFs for instance several exercises are just on the audio tape with no reference, it is highly annoying and you quickly lose attention, i threw it out in the garbage, don't waste your money, look for something better!"
5,How the world wags,"Some very entertaining old English songs. The great favorite is track 4 From Saint to Sinner, which is quite bawdy and alot of fun"
1,To sum it up: YUCK,"Who could complain about the fabulous tunes published by Playford... wonderful melodies and truly timeless. Unfortunately, here they are performed in a coarse and unmusical way. This ""City Waites"" ensemble is NOT the same one that recorded the wonderful ""Pills to purge melancholy"" of Thomas D'Urfey. The singing here is harsh and badly out of tune. There is scant use of instruments to make up for it or cover it up. Of my set of uncounted CDs, this is one of about 3 that I have listened to only a few times- I literally can't sit through it."
1,For the most basic of beginners only.,"I found this book to be a waste of time and money. If you have ANY OTHER book on Holdem, everything here will be repetition. My personal thoughts were that this was a waste of time and money, but perhaps I am too harsh. If you are giving someone their very first book, and they are a beginner, well, perhaps this is the book. Otherwise, not. But this is just basic stuff. Very basic stuff."
5,Great advice!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am new to the game and found ""Maximum Dave"" to be insightful and funny. His approach to the game made me confortable and confident. I would recommend this book to all new players even GIRLS!!!!!!! My computer is in my bedroom and he taught me things that even my husband could not."
4,Thoughtful,"This was a book to be read by any thinking adult. It feels so quiet, because of his silence. On the other hand his thoughts are screaming to come out. The book has hope written all over it. Like all good books, it has tragedy and humor. Don't pass this one up!"
4,ZuZu Oil-Free Liquid Foundation,"I bought this product from Whole Foods and really liked it. The product you sent me seemed to be a bit different.Your product has a slight smell of perfume and the other one didn't have an odor. You product seems a bit runnier.I still like what you sent, but I'll go back to the one a Whole Foods next time so I can be sure I'm getting the real deal and not being slipped a different product. Forgive me if my suspicions are unfounded."
5,ZuZu Lux foundation,"My wife uses ZuZu Lux oil free foundation and this is her review. First and foremost, ZuZu Lux products are cruelty free. The consistency is light and the coverage is medium. If you're looking for full coverage, this foundation isn't it. I have dry skin and this foundation keeps my skin feeling supple and soft. It stays in place and is long lasting. It washes off easily with face wash and water. The color L-14 blends in perfectly with my light to light-medium olive skin."
5,"NICE CLOCK, VERY LOUD TICKING","Beautiful product, looks great in our kitchen. Prettier than the image shown! But the ticking is quite loud. If you buy this make sure it's in a room where it won't bother you."
5,All about Corduroy,Corduroy is my families favorite and most loved bear. This book has the 2 favorite stories. Corduroy and a Pocket for Corduroy. I've read these stories over and over to my grandchilren.
4,Read Rose-Tinted Bifocals to relax and to think,"Looking Through Rose-Tinted Bifocals, by Angela Huston, is worth your time and energy! A series of newspaper articles, the book works well as a ""short read"" or as a longer one. The topics and timelines are mixed -- sometimes with connections, often with none. But connections aren't needed because the snippets of daily life are usually presented with humor and often with a ""been there, done that"" reaction from the reader. Huston's teaching career is often evident -- perhaps because I am also a teacher! The title well represents the attitude!"
2,For older teens,"This book is pretty intense for younger teens and preteens. It is very creepy, scary, makes you want to sleep with the lights on if you can sleep at all. And yet,in the end it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The plot sort of falls apart at the end, lots of weirdness going on but no concrete reasons why. For me, the book had a genuinely intriguing and spooky beginning and the ending fell flat, left me with way too many questions and was a let down."
4,Bodum Replacement Beaker,"Needed a replacement beaker as my husband's ""heavy hands"" broke our original one. He wanted to throw the whole thing out and buy a whole new coffee press. I bought just the replacement beaker and saved some money. Works great as long as I don't let him handle the coffee press :)"
5,Bodum 12 cup glass,"Got my replacement bodum spare glass coffee press beaker . Thank you Amazon for the free shipping to Hawaii and great product. It came well packed and love the beaker and it's just well made. Just love my Bodum! Amazon is such an amazing company, good products and reasonable prices."
4,Perfect fit!,"So, I had read other reviews and was a bit cautious about making sure I had the right size. Well, the beaker came today and fits perfect! I agree with most of the other reviews that these beakers are VERY FRAGILE - so easy does it. Don't be fooled by the name, this is call a 12 cup size, but my wife and I use it for our coffee on the weekends and we each get about 1-1/2 ""weekend cups"" from a pretty full brew."
5,Perfect Replacement,"I broke the glass beaker for my classic 12 cup Bodum french press and this is perfect. Good price, extremely quick shipping and in perfect condition."
3,Bodum 12 cup replacement ?,"The replacement is 3/32"" smaller than the original. It is loose in the metal frame and slides out when pouring the last cup."
5,Bodum Glass Replacement,The glass I received as a replacement actually fit better than my old one. Prompt Shipping and a relief that I didn't have to buy a whole new unit.
3,I made the same mistake,Like a lot of other people I got the wrong size. It's nice for watering the house plants. When I got the right size one I carefully wrote the correct size in paint marker on the bottom of the metal holder. When the new one breaks at least I'll know what size to get to replace it. Oh and by the way- this is really the best way to make coffee.
4,"Bodum replacement glass beaker, size?","We have been using the Bodum coffee press system for 20-30 years, and at times we do break the glass, so we have ordered replacement glasses. We just wish that the glass beaker should have the mark on the glass, the cup size!As years go by, we do wonder about the real ""cup capacity"". The old glass have no info about the cup capacity! This is our only problem that we have with Bodum! Thanks!"
2,Broke 2 so far,"The price is high for the product. The glass needs to be thicker to withstand a minor bump in the sink. Glass has cracked both times when tapped on porcelin sink. To replace it costs 10 dollars, so now have more than 60 bucks invested....."
2,Perfect fit-but cheap glass,"This fit the large 12-cup coffee press perfectly. Our old one lasted 9 years until my husband dropped it on the Saltillo tile floor. This one arrived within two days (thank goodness) and fit snugly into the metal coffee press. It seems just as good as the original: keeps our coffee warm for hours and doesn't slip when pouring.Update: This cracked four months after use, so I've changed my rating to two stars. It worked great till the crack appeared. Nothing pleasant about seeing THAT first thing in the morning . . .We're ordering a knock-off replacement for half the price that has better reviews."
1,Bodum Glass replacement loose in steel frame,The replacement glass canister did not fit tightly into the bodum steel frame (which is in fine shape) so slipped out and broke!!
5,Good Quality,"Bought this as a replacement. The glass is of good quality and does it's job to make us coffee! My husband and I love French Press coffee. We grind our coffee fresh (which makes it extra good in the French Press). If you've never had French Press coffee, I highly recommend you try it."
4,More robust than the original--but still glass!,"I've replaced this twice now. The new one is actually thicker glass. Seems more durable.Doesn't fit in the plastic holder as tight as the old one.Although it seems more durable, it is glass and I fully expect it will break again."
3,Maybe they should call it the Bodum Breaker,"By the time you're reading this review, you've already experienced some event between a nuisance and a disaster involving your OEM Bodum oversized coffee press beaker. Well, this one is just like the one that crashed to the floor, fell in the sink, shattered in the dishwasher or whatever. But now you know better, so this one you will likely handle with somewhat more care, as befits so fragile a vessel. Good news: We broke our original in a month but have had the replacement for nearly a year. Still makes great coffee. We decided not to attempt removing the beaker from the holder for cleaning, a misstep that led to the destruction of our original issue."
4,storage shed w/ playhouse,"Still in the process of building, but the plans are great. They come with a complete stock list, so you don't have any wasted materials.You probably should have a little framing knowledge. The step by step directions are nice, but they don't explain everything. Well worth the price."
5,Audio companion to Plum Village Chanting and Recitation Book,"This CD is the audio companion to Thich Nhat Hanh's ""Plum Village Chanting and Recitation Book,"" ISBN # 0938077910. The CD contains the bulk of the recitations for your daily practice. The tunes are easily mastered if you wish to join in, the sound quality is excellent, and the singing is clear and at times arrestingly beautiful. Well-placed ringing of deep and high bells mark beginnings and endings and provide a source of focus for your meditation practice. The book provides the structure for your daily practice sessions and offers additional chants, poems and brief sutras recommended for your daily practice but not found on the CD. This CD, in conjunction with the companion book, can be used daily to structure your practice sessions, to provide support to settle the mind, and to rehearse important Buddhist teachings. Also recommended is Thich Nhat Hanh's ""Plum Village Meditations,"" which I hope will someday be available on CD."
5,HIS VOICE SLIPS LIKE THE BEST AGED RHUM (rumba de salón),"My father got a reel-to-reel copy of ""AQUELLAS LINDAS MELODIAS""from an vynil LP by the early sixties... Since then (when getting imported records was a titanic empress) I've been searching for more songs from Guillermo Portabales.¡I'm inmensely happy to find so much ""new"" rediscovered material here in Amazon!THis CD'deserves a 10 in my scale for Cuban 'SON'singers and ¡Listen to his guitar!but never skip ""AQUELLAS LINDAS MELODÍAS""... That recording is Beyond my scale. One I would take if i naufragate on a lonely island -and I have some thousands of records-. If you like SON MONTUNO, RUMBA DE SALÓN, GUAJIRAS.PORTABALES IS A MUST Have...""Aquellas lindas melodías"" for sure. This ""Amorosa guajira"" w'ont dissapoint you."
3,fragile but may be necessary,"Why are these strategy guides always printed so badlythat they cannot survive a single read-through? Thosewho care about these books want to refer to them over and over again, so they deserve a proper paperback binding,instead of a binder inferior to that found on thetypical drugstore magazine.My ten year old boy likes this book, but my six yearold is the one who really loves it. Both can use theinformation, after playing for some months without everfinishing the game. Don't buy this book until you'vealready spent some time with the game on your own - whyspoil the fun for those parts that you can figure outfor yourself? Save it for when you get stuck."
1,NOT NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This walkthrough/strategy guide is not needed. I beat the game without it, and from other reports it tells you everything. Heck, I'd bet it even tells you the endings. So if your looking for a challenge, then I'sd suggest that you DON'T BUY THIS GUIDE"
1,NOT NEEDED!!!!!,"This walkthrough is not really necessary for this game. I beat it and I had no Idea what I was doing. I just kept going and collecting ship parts. The only things that you really need to is make sure that you get at least a part a day,taht's it... Even if you don't know how, tyr getting it anyway, and if you can't get it, then try to get a different part. that's it . so this walkthrough is not really needed, unless your not a hardcore gamer."
5,FANTASTIC!,"Gleanings is an amazing package of poetry. It's fat-187 pages of ""old poems and new poems,"" beginning with feisty poems of girlhood, the segueing into poems of marriage, ultrasound, pregnancy, empty-nesting, and ending with haunting poems about taking care of a mother with Alzheimers and grieving for a lost father. On the way, Shipley invokes Virginia Woolf, Carolyn Forche, Denise Levertov, Jim Morrison, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelly, Robert Penn Warren, William Blake, William Butler Yeats, Matthew Arnold, Shakespeare, A.E. Houseman, Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, Emily Dickinson, Eliot and Pound, James Merrill, and Betty Friedan. This is a rich book indeed, an almost-memoir, a navigation of one woman's complex life."
5,From the Publisher,"""Frank Lloyd Wright not only designed buildings but also drew them--with legendary skill. His draftsmen and apprentices helped to bring over 1,000 of his innovative ideas into presentation and working drawings, but it is Wright's genius that uniquely informs them all.

4,Comprehensive practical information for the adventurous,I have found this to be a useful tool in exploring Northern Thailand and beyond.
1,"A disappointing book, marred by poor use of language and gra",The most striking feature of this book is the virtual illiteracy of the authors. There are a significant number of instances where apostrophes are used incorrectly. Single subjects take plural verb forms and vice versa. Some sentences have no object. This may sound like a pedant's critique but grammar is an intrinsic aspect of language and incorrect use is not only irritating but results in nonensical and meaningless statements. If the authors are intending to publish another edition I strongly suggest they have it edited by someone who can read above the level of a twelve year old.
2,I Like Palahniuk But I Don't Like This,"This was sold as being like a modern-day ""Catcher..."" ? I don't get that at all. This book is much more confined and narrow in scope and isn't written nearly as well. The overall tone of this novel is different and much darker. Holden was a kind soul who, ultimately, chose NOT to sleep with the prostitute. Terry Taft is a malignant soul who not only sleeps with prostitutes, but wouldn't be beyond raping and murdering them as well! This book is pretty unpleasant ( intentionally and not ) to slog through and has little to redeem it. It can't even live up to the provocative ""Angry White Male"" hype ( this isn't like the movie ""Falling Down"" or anything even close ) on the back cover description. I only gave it two stars because I have certainly read worse and cannot justly give it only one. Palahniuk, Salinger, and Toole fans should avoid this and the rest of you aren't missing anything vital here either."
4,Brutal and Hilarious,"This is definitely not a typical read. If it were a movie, it would receive an NC-17 rating. Pervasive sexual situations and language throughout as Rey creates a completely believable character. His every action, thought, and word is completely unbelievable. He is seriously demented, brutal, and hilarious. I've never read a book like this before. Dennison Rey pulls no punches when it comes to language, descriptions, or characterizations. Not for the faint of heart, but definitely recommended."
4,A Good Portrait of the Time,"Although this book is billed as a mystery, it really is more a portrait of a specific relationship and time period. It seems to portray very accurately Florida in 1949, a homophobic and racist society. The focus of the book is the relationship between Dan, ex-Navy Lieutenant and Bud, ex-Marine, now working as a police detective. They have to come to terms with their being gay men in a society where it is not only not condoned but illegal. There is a murder which involves the Klan, corruption and coverups. But it really is the time period which stands out. The author does a good job of portraying this claustrophobic society where much is condoned as long as it is not made public. I think you will enjoy the book; it is well written and moves at a good pace. A very good effort for a first novel. I would look forward to a sequel with Dan and Bud."
3,Good story,"The story line keeps moving; the protagonists are reasonablywell developed, as are many of the minor characters. I have never experienced the ""deep South"" racism as described here. Ihave read about and seen items on the t.v. news, so I cannotspeak for the accuracy of the protrayal. My major gripe: why somuch emphasis upon the use of the ""f"" word, and for that matter,the other profanity used? Please----don't con me with ""that'sthey way they talk"" baloney. It is absoutely unnecessary to usethe ""4-letter"" words (o.k., I will grant upon occasion, yes, butnot the extent used here)."
1,Not what it seems!,This flag came frayed and with stains on it. It seems as though it came off the press too early and the paint ran. I was going to send it back but it wasn't worth the cost in shipping to send it back! I ended up just throwing it away. All it was worth was trash.
3,Great for wall display,"I ordered this flag to hang from a pole, and it is clearly not designed for that purpose. The image is one sided, with the image appearing backwards on the opposite side of the flag. The flag is also very thin, actually see-through, which is okay but doesn't speak well for the quality of the fabric. If I had ordered this to hang on a wall, it would be perfect, but for outside or flag pole display it doesn't work. In addition to the thin fabric, the grommets are cheaply made and only look good from one side."
1,For Dolphy Fans Only,"Expecting Dolphy to play flute with Nelson on alto sax, I wound up with a primarily double alto sax session which is a no go for me no matter who the paticipants are. 1 track has Nelson on tenor sax with Dolphy on bass clarinet and flute at various points.All this was spelled out in black and white in the original liner notes which appeared on the back of the original LP, for all to read before puchasing. Unfortunatly internet buyers do not recieve the same consideration.SCREAMIN' THE BLUES with trumpeter Richard Williams added to the band is the better one, if you must."
4,"Excellent composer (Nelson), genuis soloist (Dolphy)","One of a host of consistently brilliant recordings for ""New Jazz."" ""Images"" features one of his prettiest bass clarinet solos."
5,Magisterial cultural history,"This book is indeed a model for the writing of intellectual and cultural history. The manner in which it unites its disparate threads -- plastic arts, music, literature, philosophy, politics -- is breathtaking. Such other classics as Carl Schorske's _Fin-de-Siecle Vienna_ pale by comparison, precisely because the unification of different themes is not carried out with such panache or such success. Janik and Toulmin top off their cultural history with a convincing demonstration that Wittgenstein's thought is most important precisely where it departs from the analytic tradition it helped spawn: that is, where it points _beyond_ the limits of language and analysis."
2,intellectual history??,"okay i've been trained both in sociology and philosophy and would say the book brings the poorest of both worlds.. never believed in intellectual history in general, but this kind of book, with its judgements about Kierkeggardian or Wittgensteinian 'individualism' as a 'natural pathology' of early twentieth century continental bourgeoise society, does nothing but buttress the self-complacency of our now liberal societies. Therefore despite some 'interesting' anectodes and impressions from Habsburg Vienna, the philosophical depth of the book doesnt go above our usual journalistic wisdom. I dont understand how other reviewers found this book brilliant or anything like that. I think recommendable as passtime only."
1,Sell Out Hacks!!! Buyer Beware,"Is it wrong to expect dance music CDs to include dance music? You know, you see something advertised as one thing, you buy it and it's totally something else. There's a big sticker on the front of the CD case that says ""BREATHE, featured in the Mitsubishi commercial...or whatever"". This lead me to believe that the whole album would be a little something like that song. WRONG!!!! The rest of this CD is all mediocre chill And nothing against people who're into Chill, but personally I don't care for it, if I want to sleep, I'll turn out the light. Pretty much what this album says to me is ""Hi We're Telepopmusic, we know most people wouldn't give a us a second thought, so we made this song to sell our album."" Maybe that's being a little harsh, but I feel very cheated, I trusted this group to give me something, and what they gave me, was not what I asked for. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
4,Mutant music.,"A beautiful array of artificial and sampled ""nature"" sound bytes (crickets, birdcalls) played alongside mesmorizing electronic beats; compositions that are evocative of both futuristic and vintage sounds. Music full of imagery - fields, skies, static, radio, flappers, crooners, disco. So strange and sometimes so moving. Highly recommended."
2,1st half worth hearing- second half not worth anything,"Honestly I was very excited to hear the first half of the album, I listened to it three times through hoping the second half would get better. It just started to annoy me even more. It sounded worse than some of the most amateur recordings of wanna-be hip-hop ever written. I was shocked that ""Let's Go Again"" was ever produced- It's TERRIBLE! Most of the samples are so completely random and pointless it was as though they were trying to throw in every sample they'd ever heard without rhyme or reason.Don't get me wrong, there is a market for this album- one may like the whole thing even. In all fairness the first few songs are worth hearing. However the remix of the single ""Breathe,"" at the end of the album isn't all that exciting. If you like trip-hop, and want to hear truly talented musicians look up Esthero, Lamb, Massive Attack- even Hooverphonic. But don't waste your money on this full length album, buy the single."
1,Not Worth the Few Good Tracks,"""Breathe"" is great, yes. And there are a few songs that are in the same vein that are all right, track 10 being a good example. Otherwise, this album is pretty shabby. The songs aren't really that good, and differ little from the same basic makeup. This would deserve maybe three stars if it wasn't for ""Da Hoola."" This is the worst rap song i have ever heard, no joke. It is horrible and wretched and makes me sick. In the end, I'll give them respect for ""Breathe,"" but i would buy the single, not the album."
3,Not surprised...,"That most of the negative reviews are because people were expecting a CD full of ""advertising jingles.""I'm a fan of chill and ambient musics and I heard this album a few years ago and liked it very much. I've never seen the TV commercial so many have talked about, so I can't say that I'm jaded. And I also heard that some other company used an Air song and one of my favorite songs from Modest Mouse... so glad I cut TV out of my life so I don't have to go through what some of these folks do.I do like Breathe, but there's more to this album than one song. Smile is a really good tune as well, and L'Incertitude is good listening. Here's a hint... listen to the clips here on these web sites before spending money and then crying about how you were ""duped"" into something from a car advertisement."
4,Mellow Out With Telepopmusik,"Telepopmusik is a good album to mellow out with. I like this album when driving in the car on a long trip. It just seems to mellow me out from road rage. Before purchasing this album, I have heard not so good things about this album with the exception of the track ""Breathe"", but I ignored them and just bought this CD. And after listening to it on my way home, I began to like the simplicity of the tracks. It's good in my opinion."
4,Pretty good,"I bought this Album because of the song ""Breathe"", and overall I think it was a worthwhile purchase. There are one or two songs I skip over, but I really like ""Genetic World"", and ""Dance Me""."
1,Save your money...unless you can't LIVE WITHOUT BREATHE,"I was supremely disappointed when I listened to the whole CD. Even on bad CDs there are at least two songs that I like. That is not the case here. The CD is weakly written and produced. There is nothing that will shock you or make you smile. The music, other than breathe, is atonal and makes you cringe when you finally understand the next song is going to be just as bad, if not worse."
4,The Music Revolution will not be televised... in the U.S.,"In case you didn't know, a musical revolution is happening in Europe. From France to Norway, to Spain to Poland, there is a pure, raw energy that is missing in pop music here in the US. Our music industry is so money oriented that it shuns the true American musician (of whom there are many).This is a very good album if you're into 'chill' electronic music. Very well orchestrated and has hints of jazz in many ways."
3,"""FROM THE CAR COMERCIAL ! ""BREATHE""","WITH THE GUY CAR POOLING,FRIENDS AND FREELOADERS AROUND!ITS A GREAT SONG TO RIDE AROUND TOWN WITH!I JUST BOUGHT IT FOR THAT SONG ONLY,BUT TRACK NUMER#4SOUND EXACTLY LIKE ""MACY GRAY"" I SWEAR ITS HER? BUT ITS NOT!BEAUTIFUL SONG THOUGH WHERE SHE REMIND HERSELF SHE'S STILLATTACHED TO HER EX ""WHO CANT RELATE TO TO THAT IM I RIGHT GIRLS?BESIDES THE ""ANNOYING"" ENINSTIEN OBSESIVE AFTERTRACK QUOTASTHAT DISRUPTS THE REPEAT OPTION YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-BURN ANDEDIT THAT STUFF OFF THE TRACKS YOU WANT WHICH IS ALSO A HEADACHEOTHER THAN THAT IF YOU JUST WANT THOSE TWO SONGS..GOOD BUY"
1,short cd-player life!,"What a disappointment. Except for Breathe, the songs are very thin and boring, don't waste your time or money. If you want some good electronic get the new Oakenfold (Bunkka) or Underworld (A Hundred Days Off).You've got better things to do with ($) than to buy this and play it once!"
4,French electropop,"This is good French electropop. I have to disagree with the first reviewer that tis is boring. The album is much better than the top 10 albums on the US charts now. The songs range from retro French disco to modern electropop. Vocals by mainly McClunsky lend to the songs some emotions while the production of the members of Telepopmusik is impeccable and stylish.Star tracks include the excellent first single Breathe and the spectacular Smile. I also like the song Love Can Damage Your Health. This is a good combination of art and fun. Soda Pop's hand in Da Hoopla also brings some funk to the album.Overall, the album improves with each listen."
3,Can you say ...?,"This music is fine, but have any of you heard of Portishead or Goldfrapp? If you had, you'd see that this music is, at best, borrowed from the two. Don't buy from this band. Buy the artists they copy."
5,GOLDFRAPP/ PORTISHEAD/ BILLIE HOLIDAY,"All this an more as far as influences go, this is such an awesome cd, I bought it originally for one song "" love can damage your health"" The type of style that Angela shows in this cd is absoultely great, her voice is hard to explain except for a cross between Billie Holiday and Goldfrapp and Portishead all together, absolutely Awesome, if you have a true love for all sorts of music then you will not be dissapointed with this cd whatsoever. Buy it, it's worth every penny!"
2,One hit wonder,"While Breathe was just as delightful as it was the first time I heard it, the rest of the album disappoints. Not as smooth or clever to my point of view. Buy the track and save your money."
3,Review for Télépopmusik,Personally expected more from this album - after a while it gets a bit... boring. But for people who like dance music it is a nice album.
3,A couple of good tracks and a lot of HUH?,"Honestly I didn't know what to make of these guys. Breathe (both the 'radio' edit and the remix) is so well done, and the title track is pretty good too.... but then you run into ""Lets Go Again"" and a couple of the other tracks and you think, OK, what happened there? Were they pushing for a release date and this was what they had to work with?I'm thinking ""Genetic World"" would have been better released as an EP, with a lot of the little esoteric bits left out. On some recordings (Deep Forest, for instance) they would work; here they don't."
1,Wish I could rate it Zero,"We purchased one of these through a local Ace Hardware. Within two months the motor died. When we tried to get it serviced through the local company that is licensed for Essickair, we were charged for labor since ""that is their contract."" I tried to get reimbursed by Essickair for this labor charge and received a rude phone call telling us they wouldn't cover it. Apparently, to get labor covered you have to ship the unit to them. (Which would cost an arm and leg, but they don't care about that.) Avoid this company - they will not stand behind their products."
1,Essick Air Products 4D 7800 console humidifier,"Avoid Essick!!We have 2 Bemis humidifiers with same evaporative capacity and case design. One has rotary switches; the other has digital controls. Both are functional and QUIET at lower fan settings.The Essick unit (successor ownership to Bemis) is intolerably NOISY at even lowest fan settings. Customer service at Essick told me they were aware of the fact that these units are noisy and ""that's just the way it is""...."
3,Neat product,Typical sip adapter with good audio quality.Cons:1. the shipped firmware 1.5.1 doesnt allow voip services other than global village to accept an incoming call. Had to downgrade the firmware to 1.2.2 to make that feature work2. When someone is on the pstn you cant pick up the voip phone. Had to force the box to voip only mode.
5,Sango Splash Square Baker,Great product and just the right size for so many dishes! Matches my other Sango Splash pieces wonderfully!
4,Get It! If You Can Find It!,"There are approximately six Cranium fans in the world, but don't let that fool you. If by some dumb luck you're reading this review, let me suggest picking this up if you can find it. It's extremely fast German thrash with pretty sickening and juvenille lyrics. Unlike Cannibal Corpse who seem to take their lyrics and image quite serious, Cranium realize what they're singing about and never take themselves seriously for a minute. The songs even have Mad Magazine-esque pictures by them. The songs also have goofy sound effects to narrate the subject matter of each particular song. Though they may not be serious, don't be fooled-They are serious musicians. You may never have heard of them, but they have one great guitar player. The vocals are high pitched, whiny and squealy, almost comical. I think that was intended coz all three band members sing in the same style. You can't go wrong with Cranium if you like the thrash genre."
3,"The ""War and Peace"" remix is worth the price of the cd","Ryuichi Sakamoto has always been hit and miss with me. He has written some of the most beautiful piano melodies ever created, yet on many albums, the masterpieces are accompanied by 30 minutes of white noise. This brings us to ""Bricolages"", an entire cd's worth of remixes from Sakamoto's 2004 release, ""Chasm"".Like ""Chasm"", ""Bricolages"" is painful to listen to in spots, but when you get to track 3, the Cornelius remix of Sakamoto's thoughtful ""War and Peace"", prepare to be blown away. Keigo Oymada (aka Cornelius) does a brilliant job of enhancing Sakamoto's original concept and taking it into an entirely different dimension.There are a few more listenable tracks here but ""War and Peace"" is the reason to purchase this cd. A very good tune transformed into an unforgettable classic. One of the finest remixes I've ever heard."
5,Big Help,In addition to this book I've bought Yamuna's DVDs. I think they're all great. Its easy to do and really feels great.
2,body rolling only with balls,"I was hoping to find a book that had more information about using the foam rollers often used in physical therapy, but this is really set up to use the ball shown in the workout and the exercises are not necessarily transferable to other equipment."
5,Beautiful photographs of a far away place,"I bought this book because we are planning a trip to Patagonia. This book with its magnificent photographs has been a huge help in planning the trip. Not because it gives any travel tips, but the photographs speak for themselves. This is not a travel advice book. There is no information regarding where to stay or eat. However, the photographs tell me what not-to-miss sites to include in my tour. The photographs are so gorgeous that I cannot hardly wait to get there. This book plus a good South American travel agent have allowed me to establish a travel plan to the most scenic locations. The photographer must have spent a long time traveling the area. His views of glaciers, lakes, dramatic clouds and wildlife show his talent. Many outstanding panoramas are included. These must have been taken with a high quality panorama camera. This is a very nice photo book, to be looked at over and over again."
1,Bad product and bad service,"The whip almost immediately started coming apart. Eventually I used some special leather glue to repair it and it immediately upon use started coming apart again. In addition to it being a bad product, I got bad service. I asked for expedited shipping a few days before Halloween and it was being shipped from an adjacent state. Well, it arrived after 5 business days and came later than a different item I ordered a day later from a company farther away. So overall, everything was bad."
3,Beware the chain.,"The watch itself is lovely. It's pretty and seems fairly sturdy. The chain, however, is darker in tone to the point of looking absurdly cheap... which it apparently is. I'd been wearing it for about 2 weeks when the clasp broke! Thankfully the watch itself was not damaged when it fell and I'm handy with jewelry pliers, but I'm seriously considering buying a replacement, higher quality chain with a lobster clasp. Not much bang for your buck when you have to factor in the price of a replacement chain."
2,Don't Judge A Pendant Watch By It's Cover,"This is one of the most gorgeous pieces of jewelry I've ever seen. That said, it's also crap. I was so excited when I first saw the gorgeous chain and detailing. Then, I opened up the watch to see a beautiful watch-face, considerately set to my local time. And then the back silver part, covering the workings compartment of the watch, fell off. I attached it again. It fell off again. I clicked it on one more time, and then I tried to change the time to make sure I could. I couldn't! Then the plastic cover of the inner workings and battery compartment fell off. I spent the next half hour trying to make it all fit together so I could just keep this gorgeous thing! But I couldn't. So I'm sending it back, extremely dissapointed. This was a present from my father and of course he feels bad too. Unfortunately the 'limited lifetime warranty' means it's limited to fixing the watch if it stops running, not any of the rest of it."
3,SHOCKED!,"the first wu album i ever got i was searching through the cd section and i saw it enter the 36 chambers. i got my attention so i took it home and i was amazed at how good this was i thought this is real hip hop. so the sting i dont know what happened if they need better artist or just rza wasnt in his right mind but man i was suprised. the beats in some of the songs are really good but some songs like bar mitzva and rhumba really kill the album. i mean not only the lyrics but the beats are horrible. though there are really good songs on this album like thirsty, killa beez, out think me now, and dancing with wolves but i think that these west coast wu members need some practice with their lyrics someone should tell the wu members that they should show these guys a thing or two."
2,Its alrite..takes time to like it,"I got the international one CD version. My 2 tracks are 'Out Think Me Now' and 'When u com home' and I hope to like some more as I give it more time. It don't come close to The Swarm, which I'd give 5/5. As a Wu Tang fan, its worth part of the collection."
3,Split on this one....,"This CD has some of the worst and best on the same CD from the Wu.Dancing with Wolves has one of the best beats I have ever heard and the lyricsim is not bad at all.In contrast, Hatin' Don't Pay has the worst, on both accounts.I also liked the tracks Killa Beez and Thirsty."
4,Buzz Clips,"Wu Tang Clan is number one. No one else shows a united front to create uncompromising East Coast hiphop with creativity but them. There are plenty of talented rhymers on this Wu-family compilation with Solomon's Child, Shyheim and Lord Superb ( from Ghost's two classic albums) being the standouts. RZA provides most of the music but 4th Disciple and Doc Doom also contribute bomb beats. For some fans of Iron Flag, this CD's production may be a little more synthesized and California-flavored but the swords are still sharp and with joints like ""Outthink me now"" and ""KB Ridin'"", the Killa Bees are stinging haters. BZZZZ!"
4,Savenko presents a fine selection of Russian art songs.,"Vassily Savenko is not as well known in the U.S. as his colleague Dimitri Hvorostovsky, but both of them are worthy successors to a long line of Russian bassos going back to Feodor Chaliapin. On this CD, ""Russian Images"", Savenko is accompanied by the young pianist and composer, Alexander Blok. As Russian art songs share many of the charms of German lieder, including their reliance on the piano's role in the overall schema, Blok's contribution is vital. The disc contains works by a galaxy of Russian composers, including Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky, Rachmaninov, Rimsky- Korsakov, and Tchaikovsky, many of them in settings of poems by Alexander Pushkin. Although some knowledge of Russian is helpful in gaining a full appreciation of these vocal gems, the disc is accompanied by a free, but serviceable, English translation."
4,Thanks for this CD,"As a previous reviewer said, the music of Herbert Sumsion deserves more attention these days. This CD is an excellent introduction to his music. Those who are familiar with Howells, Elgar, and Vaughan Williams will find much to enjoy in Sumsion's style--fluid, natural, adept at evoking a variety of moods. My favorite work on this CD, the haunting ""They that go down to the sea in ships,"" showcases Sumsion's facility at setting text and creating a truly integrated organ accompaniment. Occasionally the performances are a little rough around the edges, particularly with the men and boys choir (some straining on the part of the trebles), but this does not really hinder an appreciation of Sumsion's compositional voice. Some lovely gems by other composers are an added bonus. Recommended!"
3,Format Issue,"I'm about half way through watching the series. The series is great! I read the reviews carefully before I ordered this DVD and took note that some reviewers complained of receiving a PAL format DVD even though advertised as the NTSC format. Well, I figured Amazon probably straightened it out by the time I ordered. I was wrong. I received a PAL version. Assuming there are not any NTSC versions available, I couldn't wait and opened the pack. It wouldn't play in any of the three DVD players I have for TV's. It did, however, play on my MacBook Pro. So, my wife and I have been huddled around the computer."
3,Buy the U.S. NTSC version here...,"WARNING: this is the PAL European version and will not work on most American DVD players. The U.S. NTSC version is listed on Amazon here:http://www.amazon.com/Soundtrack-Long-Way-Down/dp/B001FBSLY0Don't know why it's listed as a soundtrack but the description and cover is certainly the DVD series.To be released October 14, 2008, $27.99 !!!The series is not as good as ""Long Way Round"" but still worth watching. The adventure was very poorly scheduled. Most of the time they are running late and have to speed through countries to make deadlines instead of exploring where they are. Ewan and Charlie's frustration with this time pressure is much evident through the series and takes away from the enjoyment."
3,They need to do a proper trip on their own..!,"If you could take two things out of this dvd ( goes for the long way round too):1. They should do a lot more of the work themselves instead of relying on others to have things ready for them.2. Moan & complain less, I mean they are on MOTORBIKES on rough terrain. Specially Charlie.Also Boorman needs to learn from his traveling companion,, sorry I mean companions to be a bit more mature, respectful & patient.The Swiss photographer was so less present in this episode, probably didn't want to come across Charlie's childish temper like he did in the LWR."
3,Long Way Down: The complete Series,"With the notoriety McGregor and Booreman received from LONG WAY ROUND this epic adventure was sort of a let down. In the beginning business through their gear at them to take on this trip. In the first episode they had to beg, borrow or pay for it. Made the show much more believable...now everyone wants to climb on that bandwagon.Second, McGregor's wife is now wanting a piece of the action completely through the dynamic off balance. In the end McGregor promises his wife that if there is a third episode that she'll bigger part. I will not be watching part three."
4,Pure Adventure,"I loved this one! Not disappointed at all. Well put together, I felt I was riding along with Charley and Ewan. Get your copy and see!"
5,REALLY WORKS!,"Outstanding, I have been using it for years. Similar to a high prided, well advertised product but at less than half the price. My face is smooth and young looking. Many think I am much younger. Don't forget to use on your neck and upper chest. A Five star product."
5,Great Collection of Melodies!,A beautiful collaboration of musicians makes for a timeless classic! An artistic journey of music.
2,NOT the full album,"Don't be fooled by the appearance or price, this cd only comes with 2 songs as a promo that's being sold like the full album."
2,very disappointing,"I've used this for 5 weeks now and it hasn't worked for me, not even a little. I also didn't like that there were no instructions/directions for use so it's difficult knowing if you're using the right amount or applying it correctly (maybe that's why it hasn't worked for me?). The smell is strange, but it's the kind of smell that if it worked, you wouldn't really be bothered. Was hoping for a better result than what I got for the money."
2,if you like smelling like pennies,"I can't get around the smell. It is so very strong and does not dissipate with a shampoo either. Since I don't wash my hair everyday, I'm not exactly sure how to get around this.It stinks!"
4,Very pleased so far,"I bought this product at the suggestion of the girl at the spa who waxes my eyebrows, My eyebrows have become scanty looking and need alot of filling in , after a month of applying folligen with a q tip to my eyebrows, I am noticing a difference, I also spray it in my hair after showering and comb through, I even feel my hair is thicker and shinier"
2,Made loss worse,"I've been suffering from telogen effluvium and a large amount of my hair has fallen out. I'm using rogaine to try to promote regrowth, and I thought why not add this too. But in the first two weeks of using this my hair loss seemed to increase :( I'm going to save it for maybe when my hair loss has stabilized more, but for now I'm not impressed. The bottle came with no instructions for use so I'm not even sure if I'm using the product right (every other day at nigh, after application of rogaine)."
4,Works modestly well with some cons,Using the spray will make your hair grow 1.5 times faster and you will notice hair growing in the areas where it did not grow before.The cons of using this product are the blue tint the spray leaves on your scalp and the copper smell.That's it. This is an honest review.
1,Also Didn't Work for Me,"I'd been using a different immitation Therapro follicle stimulator, and decided to try this. It did not work at all. May as well have been water. I really wonder what would be in the bottle if it were tested. I used it all the way up, just because it was expensive."
1,plz avoid,i used folligen hair spray and it caused extreme scalp irritation. I have used tricomin and the quality is better and does not cause irritation. cheaper is not always better. avoid folligen.
2,smurf hair,This nay be a good product but I could not give it enough time to tell. It gave my blond hair a blue green cast and it smelled funky.
4,Good stuff,"I originally tried this spray as a hair-regrowth solution. It worked moderately well (I could definitely see an improvement), but I decided it was too messy to use on a regular basis and what hair I did have left wasn't worth the effort. I did discover that it is very effective at reducing scars for small- to medium-sized wounds. I would clean the wound with some alcohol, dab some neosporin (or equivalent), spray the padded part of a band-aid with the Folligen, and then stick on the band-aid. It helped me get rid of a really nasty burn scar from the oven and now I use it regularly for any minor wounds. I can definitely recommend this for anyone who is in the early stages of hair loss or anyone who wants to help reduce scarring in general."
4,Case takes it down a notch,"Case isn't as rousing as she appears to be on The Tigers Have Spoken, her 2004 live disc. The instrumentation is sparse, which allows for Case's voice to stretch out, most evident on ""Look for Me (I'll Be Around)"".I'd give the music performance itself five stars. However, the DVD presentation is lacking. The soundtrack is adequate, but the video is in non-anamorphic 4x3. I'm used to watching Austin City Limits on PBS in widescreen high-def, so I was expecting accompanying DVD releases to be in widescreen as well. The DVD box itself makes no mention of the aspect ratio, although it does tout the audio choices."
4,Diamond in the Rough,"This book is a little known treasure. When it comes to a healthy church, God is not complicated. Primarily modeled after Jesus' prayer in John 17, it lays a simple guideline for successful church life and growth. It is a challenge to incorporate and maintain these three priorities in all arenas, but there is lots of room for creative ways to do that. I would consider this recommended reading for any person in church ministry or leadership."
2,Bleh book,"Had to get this book for a required class at Ramapo College in NJ... this is one of the worst texts I've had to read in my college career.. There isn't really an introduction chapter, and is written in a style that seems to over complicate the very simple ideas trying to be explained.. I wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't required"
1,horrible service,i never even got this book because apparently its not a book yet amazons web site said it was. it took me 4 phone calls with 4 different customer service reps for some one to figure that out. all they gave me for the inconvenance was a 15 dollar amazon gift card which i tryed to use and doesn't work. i still don't have the book i needed and it is 4 weeks into the semester. i have baought other things from amazon and gotten them but this expeirance makes me never want to use amazon again. i would like to give you a review of the actual book but i never recieved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent book,"I'm reading this book only because it is required for my class, but in reading it, had I known about its quality, I would have purchased it anyhow. It's a very expensive book (and I do doubt whether it's worth $100--but then, I think books are overpriced nowadays)--but the content is very good. Maybe the difference between the previous reviewer and me is that I don't know much about organizational behaviour and haven't compared it to other books in this field."
3,Boring to death,"This textbook is so boring that although I made an A in the class, I couldn't wait to finish it. It uses too many technical words, it makes reference to subjects that students with a few courses in Human Resources know already. It would be better if it offered some real life examples. If you are a teacher looking for a textbook, please keep looking! If you are a student whose teacher assigned you this book..... I am sorry for you!"
1,I hope you don't have to read this book.,"The only reason you should buy and read this book is if it isrequired reading for a class. You are buying an advertisement for Fast Company Magazine. The writing is sketchy at best, and the examples are vague. You get access to their Web site for online tests, but the site is poorly done with typographical errors. There are other better texts on organizational behavior."
4,Good text book,"Bought this because it is a text book used for class. Almost $100 cheaper through Amazon, than the campus book store. The book itself is put together well, with end of chapter questions, and quizes in the back of the book."
3,Good Course Textbook,"This is a very good course textbook. It would be better, though, to have more examples in the text to explain the theories in organizational behavior. It's a little bit pricey too."
5,Soldier Love Story,"A wonderful story of love, faith and trust of the Heroes that serve and what commitment is all about bravo!"
3,Soldier Love Story DVD,I wasn't impressed with the story line. I was expecting something all to gather different. It's my fault for putting an expectation on the DVD. I would buy from this seller again. Price was in line and the delivery was quick.
5,A Film I'd Watch Over and Over Again....,"I fell in love with this film for its purity and sensitivity. It's a particularly enjoyable love story fit for the whole family: NO VIOLENCE ! NO LURID SEX SCENES! Just a simple ""make-you-feel-really-good"" movie with a heart-warming plot ~ something that is so desperately lacking in the movies that are ""inflicted"" upon us both on TV and in the movie theater. Bravo to Hallmark for another successful contribution to TV!!!Consider buying a copy for a Christmas gift!!"
5,Soldier Love Story,"It was a story about love, not sex. The characters were well played. They were thinking of each other, not just themselves. I loved the interaction between Dana, Vince and Jared. The setting and storyline were much more authentic than most. It was so easy to be drawn into the story. I wish they would make another, when he returns home - maybe a wedding? It is one of my very favorites and I watch it often."
3,Poor picture quality,"This ""review"" is for the quality of the DVD and not for the movie itself. The movie was wonderful and that is the reason I purchased it.Throughout the movie the color intensity kept changing. In the same scene the actors hair color would change dramatically. Stephanie Powers hair went from red to brown and back to red again in the same scene.There were a few moments of a ""sharp"" picture then the movie would be grainy again and dark.I don't think this is due to my DVD player or TV since I originally DVR'D the movie and had very sharp color.When watching the movie you have the option of play and scene selection. This movie did not have a closed caption option."
3,Not bad,I watched this last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Stephanie Powers looks great and she did a fine job of portraying the mother. Some of the acting wasn't believable - Jared's expressions in some scenes were forced. It is a typical Hallmark movie and they are all a bit mediocre but they generally have a happy ending. Not bad viewing for a Sunday night.
3,A Soldier Love Story/Meet My Mom movie review,"This is a typical Hallmark movie. It has a good message, but it's a bit of a sappy movie. Too much ""GOD"" in it for my taste."
5,Soldier Love Story,"Soldier Love Story is a great movie to watch. Both my husband and I enjoyed it. It is definitely a heartwarming story about courage, love, and family."
5,meet my mom,I loved it! Lori and Johnny makes a perfect couple. They should get together!That is unless they are already married to other people.I hope sometime there is another part to this love story.
4,Love Story for a Soldier,This was very enjoyable and relaxing. Times are so bad that things need to balance and this helped the mind and body to relax. Sure it is fiction but we all need help to relax and enjoy without violence.
4,Romantic Drama,"It's been awhile since I enjoyed a movie so much and I have to say it was sappy and soppy but no sex, no bad language and genuine smiling all round. I found the movie very revealing and spoke volumes to me in messages. Don't discount the romantic sappy movies - they still have something to share and frankly I would love a part two for when Sargent Vince Carrera returns from duty and maybe he and Dana get married. Any takers?"
3,A great mindless read for the beach or for a vacation!,"I don't like this 5 star rating system, it does not allow for enough choice...if this was a 10 star system this book would get a 7. I enjoyed reading the stories, which were light and cheerful. If you want to read a book as a pick-me-up, then here's your book. There was no depth to this book, either in characters or plot. You have three different (though all strong) women and a scheming grandfather who ""hooks"" each one up. Someone wrote in one of the reviews, that the stories were just too perfect... I tend to agree. Where can I get a man like Branson? Ah well, if you like this type of reading, you will enjoy this book, personally i perfer her other longer novels, such as the ""Born In"" series."
4,Where Can I Find more books featuring the MacGregor Family?,"I loved reading ""The MacGregor Brides"". The book was wonderful and romantic. Please help me find the other books featuring the MacGregor family. I loved the book and look forward to reading the rest of the books featuring Duncan MacGregor and his family."
2,Disappointment.,I was disappointed by this book...I thought it was far from Nora Roberts' usual engrossing storyline. The three parts were simplistic and were carbon copies of each other. I did not feel this book compared favorably with her usual in-depth character development which made you want to continue further with the characters' lives. Though Ms. Roberts knows how to make you like the characters and knows how to write believable dialog this book just did not come up to her usual high standards.
4,Nora Roberts draws me in yet again!,"I really enjoyed the three young women in this story. As I got to know them I wanted good things to happen to them. It was a pleasure to watch each of their stories unfold as well as seeing how their stories and situations were woven together. I have enjoyed Johanna Lindsey's ""family"" stories for years and am glad Nora Roberts has created this vast, fun-loving family for me to explore. I look forward to reading more in her MacGregor series."
3,This is 3 Stories in one.,Daniel MacGregor has a way of taking care of his family.... It was like reading 3 different biographies. Entertaining!
4,Grandpa knows best!,"Daniel MacGregor is a successful businessman who thinks that he knows best in matters of the heart. He wants his three beautiful granddaughters, Laura, Gwendolyn, and Julia, to settle down, get married and start producing great-grandchildren for him. Each of the young women is deeply involved in her own career, as a lawyer, doctor, or real estate magnate, but Daniel feels that family must come first. He finds a prospective mate for each of the girls and manages to have them introduced into his granddaughters' lives. Each romance encounters difficult times and resistance on the part of one of the participants or the other, but Grandpa Daniel makes sure that true love triumphs."
4,Macgregor brides,"This is one of her best books yet, I love reading about the oldman who gets in ever ones business"
5,Romantic..,"Here comes the BridesIn the continuing saga of the Macgregors, Nora Roberts introduces us to three grown up granddaughters of the likeable Patrioch, Daniel Macgregor. There's Laura, Gwen, and Julia, cousins. All three independent and hard working. Sharing a house, they are very close to each other and family and find that they have now caught the notice of their lovable grandfather. He has decided that they have been single long enough and sets off to put in their paths Mr. Right. What ensues will make you laugh, and cry and shout for more as each story winds to its end. I found their lives and the way they are led from beginnig to end so much fun to read I couldn't put it down. Definitely a good read. I think you'll enjoy their stories, so go out and read it soon.Also recommended: Serena-Caine, The Winning Hand, The Macgregor Grooms, Daniel-Ian all books by Nora Roberts"
5,Part of series,I loved this series .... had to go to second hand book store to purchase the rest of series. Took some out in the library ~ as much as I could and purchased the rest ~ second hand bookstores are expensive considering you can purchase many of the series for a penny and $3.99 for shipping. Becomes expensive b/c there are over ten books in series. Check the library first.Seller very prompt ~ would recommend. But in today's economy ~ check the library ~ you can borrow books FREE :0)
3,Typical Roberts romance fluff,"When I first started reading Roberts, her stuff was fresh to me, but after reading nearly a dozen books, I see a pattern in some of her books. This volume is a compilation of three stories in one, but it's really one story told three ways. Grandpa MacGregor wants to fix up his three granddaughters, and he has selected three men for them. All go the same way - they clash, they fight, they kiss, then they marry. If you like that kind of thing, go ahead, but honestly, there are better Nora Roberts books out there to read."
4,Excellent performance-poor hearing experience,"This is a great live cd in the way that it has some of the best old-school vader songs on it. They are brutally heavy as Vader has always been! Also you hear Peter talking to the crowd (however in Polish because its in Krakow) and everyone constantly chanting ""vader vader vader"". Thats what makes this live album full of energy and excitement.However the recording is a little low, as the guitars aren't as intense as they usually are on a regular one. For most bands this wouldn't matter, but for Vader this instrument is unbelievable and it's important to have it as high as possible.So on that note I say good album, but get Live in Tokyo or a regular album instead, because you have much to choose from!"
1,Very confusing and disappointing!,"Dr. Peeke has taken a simple, straightforward book as Body for Life and has turned it into something full of instructions and rules. At the same time they are very difficult to follow and many of them are not practical in the nowadays busy lifestyle of the women. I expected a lot more from it but the only thing which I got was a complete disappointment."
2,Huh??,"I don't get some of these gushing book reviews. Are we reading the same book? I didn't really check it over but bought it on impulse knowing that it was a best seller. The content is so basic and common sense, if I hadn't bought it at an airport while traveling I would be asking for my money back. All the before and after pictures are kind of entertaining but that's about it. The original Body for Life Book, Joe X, or 5-Factor Fitness are all much better . True, they aren't women-specific. But they're gender-neutral, and won't leaving you guessing what to do. I found Peeke's book rather wishy-washy. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because editing and production quality are good, plus I know some women will find its presentation helpful. Just not me."
1,Does not even compare to the original!,"I've been doing the Body-for-Life program for 4 months with incredible results. I was hoping this book would take this outstanding program up a level and tailor it more to women. Boy was I disappointed! What I found was a bunch of touchy-feely opinions and excuses for why women don't exercise/diet well. If you want to make yourself feel better about why you haven't been succeeding in the past, read this book, but if you're already on track, don't bother, it's a complete waste of time!"
3,Skim it and take what speaks to you,"I work-out regularly---I have all my life. I gained weight because of a medication glitch. The nutritionist that I worked with to lose the weight recommended this book. I think that it is good for women who are just getting to know themselves physically and mentally. It was overkill for me. In order to keep my life sane, I adapted the workout routine in the book to fit with the fitness classes thet I was already taking. Had I tried to adhere to every tenant and suggestion in the book, I'd have been miserable and I'd have had to re-arrange my entire life. Plus, some of the weight-checking and note-posting that the author suggests would have served only to make me more depressed over my weight gain. I know myself and I took from the book what would work for me and left the rest."
2,Don't bother,"If you're interested in the whole ""transformation"" thing, just stick with the original Body for Life - a much superior book on this topic."
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described . .f.r.v. .f.r."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed. She doesn't go into any detail about how much, how often you need to exercise to look like that in 3 months. I was expecting a detailed book on how to transform my body in 3 months. Instead I got generalities... all of which I already knew."
4,"So far, very good","From the very beginning, you realize that if you are committed to changing your lifestyle this is the book that will get you there."
2,Disappointed,I thought this book would be an adaption of Bill Phillips Body for Life adjusted to fit womens needs. I felt there was very little of Phillip's principles in the book. The menu is changed. There is no discussion of Bill's work out regiment - which is the core of his program! This book is geared toward middle-aged women who have no program.
2,"Bill, please write a book for women!!!","I read the original BFL and found it to be fantastic, so when I saw a BFL for women I was thrilled, without a second thought I bought it. It has good concepts like dividing women's life into phases, but that's it. Even though the author tried to appeal to women, I found the original BFL much more motivating. Maybe this book is OK for women who have not read other books or who have not followed a single program, but for me it was dissappointing, I felt much more involved with a male author than by a woman!!! Program lacks stucture, I can't imagine what a man would think about this book!!!"
1,What a waste of time and money,"I have been following the Body-For-Life plan by Bill Phillips for several years. I was so excited to hear that a book was coming out that would tailor this plan for women. I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book. Yikes! What a waste of time and money. It was convoluted, the forms are difficult to use (Bill Phillips gives examples, with the forms filled out, not so in this book). The most disappointing part was that all of her before and after photos are the same ones from the original (and great) Body for Life book. If she thought she could tweek the program and make it beter for women, why didn't she share more of her before and after photos? mostly, I just felt ripped off. This book was a joke. It gave me no new information and was confusing. I was hoping she would improve upon Body for Life, not so at all!!"
1,"So bad, I returned it","This book was so bad, I returned it. It doesn't even have a plan in it like the original Body for Life book. It talks about the stages of life for women - before baby, after baby, and menopausal. I didn't get any new information that I didn't already know."
5,True Lifestyle,I found Body For Life For Women the best program I've ever followed ! Who know's a woman body better than a women and one that's a doctor at that !This program is truly a lifestyle we all can live with ! Your results are truly amazing put fourth the effort and you will see the body transform right before your very eyes !Take the challenge and see the body changes you've alway's dreamed of ! The eating plan is so easy you will have no problem sticking with it longterm !
1,"Unbelievable piece of junk!.. Somebody, please buy my copy!","If you have extra money to waste, do me a favor - please buy my copy!.. I've purchased this audio book with the hope to stay motivated with the Body For Life program. Instead, I got SO SICK listening her annoying voice and stupid common sense bla bla! If you evere have been in the gym and tend to take care of your body - I can guarantee you - you'll know everything what you are about to ""learn"" from this author. Bill Phillips should demand her to change the title - it is SO misleading!"
2,Original BFL is Better,"I like the original BFL book- this one has too much unneeded information, plus it is not very clear on the actual plan!"
3,Body for Life,"This is a pretty good book, although not the most interesting I've ever read. I've gotten about half way through and I've learned some things I wanted to know about life stages and a healthy body, but it's slow reading. I'd recommend it though for anyone who seeks to know about maintaining good health at various ages."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Fitness plan and good general advice- this is in short Dr. Peeke's book. I have Bill's book and it provides a whole, well thought out fitness plan, which so far is giving a good results for me. I am already one week entirely on her plan and I gained 1 pound! Maybe there is a connection between stress and fat but so what? I want a plan which really ""removes"" or at least maintains my weight instead of just talking about this. She knows a lot of stuff as a doctor BUT so what? I am quite disappointed from her general book with a lot of ""good"" information I am reading and hearing all the time. Now I can say about this expected from many book: ""Much Ado About Nothing""."
3,Good Product,"I did like her version of Body for Life but the original book was easier to follow, especially when it came to the body building tips. It brought up some unique women issues but I did like the tips in the original Body for Life better."
2,Stick With The Original,"This book is not at all like the original body for life. The author took Bill Phillip's simple eating plan (one portion protein, one portion carbs, and veggies at at least two meals) and made it complicated. She cut out some carbs based on activity level and limited the types of carbs and veggies you eat. If you have time to sit down every evening and plan out your exericse and meal plans for the next day, then you might benefit from this book. If not, stick with the original."
2,Woman's health book,Was disappointed with this purchase. It did not prove to be all I thought it would be based on the info provided. Could've had a better description provider for buyers.
2,Wasn't impressed,I love Body for Life and I am not at all pleased with this DVD. I feel like I wasted my money. I hate to say it but Pamela Peeke kind of has an attiutde that wasn't conducive to me wanting to use it or watch it again. Sorry.
1,Glad I got it from the library,"I was considering purchasing both the book and cd - now I'm thrilled I didn't. Beyond the lack of resemblance to Phillips' program being called ""girlfriend"" was ridiculous. Save your money."
4,Opinion on Body for Life shipment,"Finally a book about women FOR women. Let's face it, we can't lift weights, do military-style push-ups, and squats like the guys--but we can do good things for our bodies and have a good attitude about it. Pamela Peeke shows us how and how other women have succeeded before us. I really like the before and after pictures."
1,Not Even Close to the Original,"I'm sure this book will be useful for some people, but I was very disappointed. I love the original Body for Life book.The women's version is a more confusing, complicated version of the original. I had hoped to learn something new or specific to me as a woman, but did not. The plan she lays out for nutrition is very complicated, impossible for real life. She doesn't give any specific information for exercise.Basically, she took the original book and tried to mix it up a little to seem different and sell more books, but all she did was make it more confusing & less helpful.My recommendation? Get the original book. Then get (or at least look at) the Journal to see good examples of the day-to-day exercise. Skip this one completely."
3,Get Bill's Book Instead,"In some ways, this book feeds into outdated, negative stereotypes about women and their potential. For example, by featuring only small hand weights (and no machine exercise options), it perpetuates the stereotype of the ""weaker sex,"" promotes a cliched emphasis on appearance over fitness, and revives the old-fashioned idea that gyms and health clubs are still a males-only domain where women don't belong. Working out at home shouldn't be a woman's only option and it's a shame this book presents it as such.I recommend Bill's book instead, which works just as well for women as it does for men. It'll do wonders for your confidence and you'll suprised at how much you can achieve when you challenge yourself."
2,Body for Life for Women,"The title of this book leads you to believe that it is an extension of the original Body for Life philosophy geared towards women. Unfortunately, the title is the only resemblance to the original program. The book offers no new information and the exercise and diet portions of the book are vague ,generalized and difficult to understand. There are also no photos of women who have used Dr. Peeke's program. The only one's used are from the original book. This even further validates my suspcions that Dr. Peeke wrote this book in an effort to capitalize off the popularity of the original Body for Life. A poor compliment to the original manuscript."
1,Disappointed in the complexity of the program,"I have completed the original Body for Life program after each of my two children. I am on my third time around after my third child and have completed 10 weeks. The weight is coming off slower and thought that the ""for women"" would give me some insight as to how I can boost it up. I was very disappointed. This is not the Body for Life mentality at all. It is a completely different philosophy and does not follow the cardio or weight intensity training as the original. They took something so simple and made it incredibly complex with the varied portion sizes depending on ""Smart"" something or nother. I guess I learned that I am not ""Smart"" enough to do this program and will stick to the original Body for Life for the simple portion size (fist size) and simple work out programs. Thanks but no thanks!"
1,Stick to the Original Body for Life,"The message I got from this book is:If you are past menopause, forget about looking good. Your goal with the Body for Life program, in this final, last phase of your life (phase 4,) should be to live independently as long as you can, with out getting sick.Just five years ago I did the original Body for Life and had great success. I thought this book would be an accompaniment to the original Body for Life by Bill Phillips, with more emphasis on how to tailor the program for women. For the most part, it was about Dr. Peeke's research into the four phases of a woman's life and how they contribute to weight gain.Long on data and cute remarks ""girlfriend"", short on motivation and help."
1,Save your money,"I really dont like this book. THe author says it's the same as the original BFL, but it is not. It's complicated, and sometimes you feel you dont know what to do with all that information. The exercise plan is different than the original ( number of reps) and she could had described the diet in an easier way.She suggests eating chocolate when you need to and no free days! I dont know how Bill Phillips authorized this book! You are going to lose weight following this diet, but if you want real transformation, go for the original BFL."
1,The Original is Better.,"Having long been a fan of Bill Phillips and devotee of Body For Life, I was intrigued by the idea of Body For Life For Women and bought a copy as a gift for my wife. Day One: I received the book in the mail. Day Two: My wife and I each read the book and discussed it. Day Three: I returned the book by mail. Why? Two reasons. First, the material about the four phases of a woman's life, although interesting, was quite useless to her exercise and nutrition program, and the rest of the material didn't offer more than that found in the original Body For Life. Second, we found the book not as well organized, presented, and illustrated as the original and it included many unnecessary charts and tables. Simply put, my wife decided she will stick with the Phillips original because it's complete and so much better."
2,Disappointing gift,"I bought this book for my wife, we're both Body For Lifers in our mid thirties, because I thought it would address (as promised) women specific issues. Now that she's read it she's disappointed with the material and the message. Sentences like ""we all get the fat paunch in our stomachs and you can't get rid of it, only make it smaller"" are a far cry from the ""You can do anything!"" mantra of Bill Phillips. This a book aimed at helping women accept themselves more than an exercise and diet plan that will work. Stick to the original..."
4,Girl Power,"Thank you for writing a book with a women in mind. I liked the section on diet and hormones, something all women can relate to thats for sure. The exercises are basic but when done right give you a good workout. I also bought the Volumtrics and The Backsmart Fitness Plan, these three books togethere are a great asset to have. Where one lacks in diet detail the other fills your needs and the third book mention filled different fitness levels, from beginer to advance for movements for abdominal work, stretching and ball exercises and cable work to get that long lean look. Thank you again for writing a great book for women."
2,Not as good as the original,"I love the Body for Life program and started it in 1999 when Bill was on Montel. I was excited to see the Body for Life for Women book and thought it would be a great book to refresh my workout/eating and get more motivation from the book. It was nothing like the original Body for Life. There is some good information, but really the BFL book outlines and gets you motivated to change your life. This book did not.If you are starting out and want to change your life please pick up the original BFL. Good Luck!"
4,great for women,I liked this book. It is written in a casual yet straight forward way. The plan is easy to follow and tailored to the busy woman.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. I had hoped it would follow the basic BFL guidelines, but with less of a body-building emphasis for women. It really had nothing to do with the original BFL program, and I think is just capitalizing on the name. It also seemed egotistical to me for the author to talk about ""Peeke performance"", when she really isn't that well known. One of the great things about the original BFL program was it's simpicity, but this book does not define any clear-cut program."
1,Not as easy as Dr. Peeke makes it sound......,"This book has some interesting ideas but it does not give you a complete layout to follow, it does talk about the diet, the good foods and the bad and it does give you a workout schedule and the exercices.....but for me it is more like this is the big picture if you can put it together then you will succeed. I took the information part of this book and will walk the weight off one walking day at the time......"
5,"""Not a Diet""",This book offers a plan to help a women develop a 'life-change' in their eating and exercise.
2,Why mess with a good thing????,"I followed the original Body for Life by Bill Phillips a few years back. In 6 months I chaned my body completely, losing 60 lbs of fat and re-gaining my life again. When I saw this book I thought GREAT, a new, improved version of the original. Boy was I wrong! This author took something that is simple, easy, amazingly effective and turned a simple program into a confusing set of rules and instructions. As if we women don't have complicated lives already! This is just a more difficult, complicated version of the original. I'm saddened that she's trying to take credit for something that has worked for so many years for BOTH men and women. Not only that this has already been done, the before and after pictures are of people who succeeded in the ORIGINAL Body for Life program. If you want something without frills, if you want a no-nonsense approach to a new body, just get the original by Bill Phillips."
2,I didn't love it.,"I prefer the regular Body for Life book. I used the regular BFL book for months (and lost weight) then I ordered this book and couldn't get into it. I gave it to a friend, never heard that she used it. So, I guess that's my answer."
4,Just missing recipe suggestions,"I was surprised by the negative responses to the book. I chose the Body for Life for Women book after it was recommended by a friend because weight loss for women is much different for men. I loved how Pam addressed the deepers seeded issues, the ""mind"", the ""hormones"", ""MIND---MOUTH---MUSCLE"" This has been the most successful program I have ever followed. Being someone that was once 275 pounds, and am well on my way to go (just 50 pounds away now), I'm following this plan because of the well rounded healthy lifestyle. I love the training method, and reading the before and after stories have been very inspiring, not to mention the before and after pictures.Pam I'm waiting on your recipe book! If you don't write it, I will! *giggle*"
3,"Too ""Women Unite"" for Me","I agree with reviewers who liked the original Body For Life very much and got this thinking that, as a woman, perhaps this would be even more helpful to me.Well, it wasn't. There is some good information but far too much, in my opinion, women empowerment--a word I've come to hate--and weird psychobabble philosophy.The exercises are pretty much the same. Which is good since those in Bill Phillips' book cover everything. I liked the nutritional advice and meal plans in Phillips book much better also. Just too much of the same of everything but what is different wasn't particularly inspiring to me.My advice is to stick with the original. I highly recommend it."
4,Good information,I like the information in this book and how it is conveyed. It's easy to understand and follow.
2,Could have been much better,I was quite disappointed in this book because I had heard what a great resource it was. Overall the content was useful and was a pretty complete listbut I felt as though it would have been better if it was condensed down into a 4 or 5 page document instead of a whole book. This would be a better book to get from the library instead.
2,Skip it,"This book is a disappointment.Although it is carefully documented, it is almost entirely made up of quotes from secondary sources. If you've read some basic books on private equity, you probably already read most of the sources used in this book. There is little in the way of analysis or any kind of value add."
3,Useful for PR professionals who do messaging work,"While this book is written for VCs, it's also a useful tool for PR people who are working on corporate messaging. It offers dozens of ways to extract information about a company's structure, value proposition, go-to-market strategy and risk management approaches. It occupies a permanent spot on my bookshelf. I recommend the Kindle version, which makes it easy to look up your favorite sections on any mobile device (ie when you're on the laptop on a plane or in a meeting and have your phone)."
1,General reference,"Thia book just give you general idea on venture capital. It isn't worth for your money. The author also not giving additional support on loopholes area. Not so friendly. So, better try another book - david gladstone is much better."
4,Macglee Ratings,"This game is funny but I disagree with some of the other reviewers on the proper target age. I got this game for my 9 year old daughter and she has loved it for a couple of years now. I recommend it for pre teens and teenies even more than adults. No one appreciates a good fart joke like a kid; a fart weapon? Heaven! The sexual allusions and sleaze factor are no grosser than the Simpsons or Married with Children. The revenge theme is also satisfying for teenies. Finally, it is very difficult to actually win this game for me, but my daughter (now 12) has achieved it many times.For those who hesitate to expose ""children"" to this I say ""Lighten up!"""
3,OK?,"This game is fun and it is a little funny. But, It hardly has any gameplay theres only three levels and they are hard to beat. I bought this game for 10 bucks. I wouldnt buy it for no more than that. This game is ok for a once in a while game but its not worth no more than 10 bucks."
4,Brilliant as usual,"Of the two tracks on this single, the acoustic recording is the best. I honestly have quickly grown tired of Call Me When You're Sober, and the Acoustic performance gave it new life, as most acoustic verstions from Evanescence do. Amy Lee is back, and Ben Moody, well... He really isn't missed. The full album Open Door is arguably better than fallen. I hope this band continues to produce fantastic goth rock."
1,Like a bad Lacuna Coil ripoff,"Seriously, its like Cristina Scabbia minus the emotion, talent, and raw power.. but rather corporate rock, sprinkled with post production and a self righteous theme in the end.. cant cover up the fact that this is as bland as it gets."
3,1972 Concert,"This is a severly edited version of the double LP release The New Seekers Live At The Albert Hall. 'Streets of London' sung by Marty Kristian is a bonus song and there is an extra chorus to 'I'm A Nut' by Lyn Paul. The video editing of the dialogue introducing Lyn is not great. Overall not bad value for money if you are a fan of this long defunct group. The best songs from the audio release are however omitted. The price is good, the content is too. Buy it and take a walk down nostalgia lane with a group who really could sing in perfect harmony."
2,Muddy Sound and dropouts for this ever changing 70s group,"The New Seekers had a constantly changing list of members. They are best known in the US for their Coke commercial ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing"" which they remade as a smash hit by leaving out the product name. In the UK they scored with covers of two Melanie songs - ""Look What They've Done to My Song Ma"" and ""Beautiful People"". This 1972 show at Albert Hall includes these hits and more. They weren't unlike the Serendipity Singers in the US. The image is not sharp and the sound is really muddy with lot of dropouts.There's not much footage of this group performing - and they are a completely different group than the Australian outfit The Seekers who recorded ""Georgy Girl"". This DVD can only be recommended to die-hard New Seekers fans.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
3,Mood music,"After seeing him live in Montreal, this CD was a bit of a letdown. It is too atmospheric for my taste. It lacks the wonderful humor and interchanges that occurred in concert, particularly with Richard Bona. Too bad a CD of the 2005 concert hasn't been released, and that the DVD is now out of print, because it really showcases McFerrin's incredible talent."
4,A very fun and very different type of game,"Befor eI got to play it, my brother kept on singing all the songs, and it bugged the crap out of me! so i picked up the controller and tried it myself, and i was amazed by how fun(ny) this game was. it's much like dance dance revolution where you have to prees the appropriate button to the beat. the songs are annoying and cool at the same time. the dialogue inbetween songs are very funny, and the storyline is great. the only problem i found was the poor grading scale, which lowered your grade sometimes even if you were really close to getting it right. so now whenever i play the song where parappa has to pee, i lose because you basically have to hit most of the buttons or you lose. i still have not beaten it, but to the point where i got, its a very addicting game and if you have a playstation, or a ps2 for that matter, i highly recommend it."
4,Short But Fun,"The premise of the game is that you're PaRappa, a dog who raps his way through winning over the girl of his dreams, who happens to be...a sunflower? Rap your way through a garage sale, making a birthday cake, driving a car, and more.The characters and situations are pretty funny, and get funnier if you mess up (especially the cake level.) The songs are ridiculously catchy and you may find yourself replaying levels just to hear the songs. The only downside to this game is that it is VERY short, and if you're good at rhythm-based games you can probably beat this one in a day. If you're looking for amazing graphics you may be disappointed, since the characters are all rendered as 2d cutouts, almost like a pop-up book. However, this is one of my favorite PSone games and if you like games that are a little on the silly side such as Katamari Damacy and Elite Beat Agents, this is a good game to buy."
3,Kind of Lame,"This is not a particularly exciting game, but it might be OK for little kids. I only bought it because it has a character in it named ""Joe Chin,"" which happens to be my name."
2,Poor Quality - But what did I expect for $10,"It's a $10 Wallet, it's almost worth $10. The main stitches on the side pockets (both sides) tore the first time I inserted cards. There is not enough material on the short sides of the stitches to expect this wallet to last very long. The stitches easily tear through the soft leather. The zipper on the interior pocket is poking a hole through the outside leather because the zipper doesn't fold flush. Next time, I would shop around."
5,Great Album,"I first bought this album on cassette back in '83 and I still listen to it. The album cover is kinda of stupid, but as they say, don't judge a book by the cover. Worth every penny. Some gems on this album, TALK, LAYBACK, IT'S OVER, FIRST TIME."
4,we sing only of blood & love,"Dax Riggs is the best singer in rock! Great lyrics, great tone and interesting mood changes thru out. I recomend this for fans of good music."
4,Good album but............,"the songs are too brief. He has undeniable talent as a lyricist and singer. My main problem with dax is that he cannot let the music breathe. The songs are too short. While there are some gems on here, I just can't help but feel a little put off that it's just over half an hour in length. The good songs are like little flashes that burn out too quick. I've seen him live multiple times, the live show is the same, fantastic but just too short. If I'm paying $15 for your cd or tickets to your show, I want to be rocked! And rocked for a while.Don't get me wrong this is a great cd. I'll continue to support dax and go see him live. But if your cd's are going to be e.p. length then I'd like to be charged e.p. prices."
4,Where'd these guys go?,"This CD has a good mix of techno industrial styles, with a vocalist who sounds somewhat like Al Jourgenson, though the music isn't quite as hard as Ministry's. The one standout, kickin' track on this CD is ""It's Time"", the last track. The song is just this amazing blend of everything - ambient, industrial, lounge, jazz, and Sgt. Peppers. The CD is worth getting just for this song!"
3,Classic Cheryl sound,"The songs that are good on this album really jam. Unfortunately not enuff of them to make a 5 star album. My pics: New Dress, Start Over, If U Were Mine,and Everyday (this was my favorite song).The rest is mediocre."
5,Easy Install,"This mount was relatively easy to install. A lot of times you have to make do with what you are given, missing parts, holes not aligned properly, but this was not the case. Just follow the directions and you got yourself a durable wall mount, no problems hanging up my 50"" plasma. Looks great."
2,If you simply can't find another study resource...,"I bought this book because my internal auditing professor used it for a graduate level internal auditing class. While it does hit on everything highlighted in CIA Exam preparation outline, it does so in a VERY boring manner. It was not well-written and was basically a cut and paste job from the primary sources. I grit my teeth every time I even attempt to study this text. There HAS to be something better out there...[sigh of despair]."
1,WORST EXPERIENCE IN ONLINE BUYING,"THIS WAS NEVER DELIVERED, KEEP ON EXTENDING THE DELIVERY DATE FOR 3 MONTHS FINALLY I HAVE TO CANCEL THE ORDER.I WONDER WHY AMAZON HAVE SUCH SELLER STILL IN THEIR LIST"
3,Wasn't exactly what I wanted.,"Tried these bags thinking they were the 4 gallon shop vac bags I had ordered previously. They weren't but it looks like they'll work anyway. They cost more and the shipping was higher too. Additionally, the packaging the shipper used (a box) seemed unnecessary for the product and it cost me more to ship from my US mail box."
5,porter cable fiber cement shear,"I have owned this fiber cement shear long enough to realize that it's a quality tool. The design is nearly flawless, effortless to use, can cut dead straight ""bad joint quality"". The tool will cut gentle arcs if need be. It raises no dust at all and the blades are extremely durable. It's variable speed allows the user to slow down for a ""cut out"". I've owned other brands of shears, some costing a hundred dollars more, and none holds a candle to this tool."
3,Works Okay But Lousy Ergonomics,"The phone looks alright and is relatively easy to use, has a decent features list, and doesn't really have any wasted features. This is a good thing because of the feature-overload so many things today suffer from. However, the phone in question feels terrible in the hand, has sub-par sound on the handset, and the cradle is very poorly designed; the phone falls out nine times out of ten unless you're very careful when you hang it up. If you are, then it's just two out of three that it falls. As a result, I can't really recommend the phone for anything other than occasional use."
1,don't buy,"We bought this corded phone (model: 29897GE2-A, date code: 6538KT) after having reliability issues with cheap cordless phones. The phone works, but the digital answering system is worthless. The system had worked fine for a few months, as far as we could tell. Now when someone calls, either they get ""message box full"" (despite there being *no* messages) or the unit resets and they get hung up on.We've since removed the power, reducing the unit to a regular phone."
1,"I agree, do not buy this phone",This phone screeches an annoying pitch as the caller is attempting to leave a message. Unplugging and plugging it in again clears this up but not for long. Plus the recording quality is poor.
2,Answering Machine doesn't work,"This phone worked great for a few months. Now the answering machine works only when it feels like it. I have called and left messages for my husband. Then, I get home and he never received them because the answering machine says ""no new messages."" This has happened to other people who have called as well. The troubleshooting guide is of no help. When I call the number listed in my warranty for assistance, I can't speak with a person. The automated suggestion is that I should pay to send this back to the company and they will send me a new or refurbished phone in return. I'm going to try this route next; although, I think this phone should have lasted more than a few months."
1,GE speakerphone 29897GE1-A is very unreliable,"I bought the GE speakerphone (29897GE1-A) for a corded speakerphone and answering machine combination. The speakerphone is fair, as the volume could be louder (2 stars). The answering machine part is worthless (0 stars). At random times the greeting reverts to a generic greeting, then tells the caller that the memory is full, even if the message counter shows no messages. Deleting messages (if any) does nothing. You cannot record a greeting, as it will respond with ""Memory Full"". You have to completely unplug it and let it sit, then reprogram everything. The only way you will know it has quit working, is when your callers tell you the machine quit working. I even have this phone on my computers battery backup UPS, so I know it doesn't even see power outages. Worst phone I have ever owned. If someone offers you a GE speakerphone for free, don't accept it."
4,Region free at last,"My 941 is region free and HD security free at last. To avoid video problems get the latest firmware update from Samsung. Then go to ebay and buy an Aiwa RC-6AS14 remote control for <$15.00. This is required. Use the Aiwa remote. Hold the shift button down while hitting repeat,prgm then clock. ADJUST appeared on the LCD screen of the DVD player then I turned it off and turned it on again. Bingo! For HC Copyright Protection disable:1. HDCP-Free: Requires only DVD Remote.2. Power On DVD player, wait until ""no disk"" display3. Press ""Angle""4. then number on the remote ""4"", ""3"", ""2"", ""7""5. TV Screen displays ""HDCP Free""6. Press ""Angle"" to turn off the ""HDCP Free"" display7. Try 1 more time from step 1-6 (HDCP Free will display)Good luck"
1,Samsung DVD-HD941 Up-Converting DVD Player,only the analog connection works w/o static to a Samsung DLP TV. the HDMI connection looks like a good concept. any required extra steps should be in the setup manual.
2,"Has problems, but at least its a nice picture","I've had this DVD player for 6 weeks now (3 of which was in the repair shop). When I first got it and played a movie, the player wouldn't eject. So instead of exchanging it with amazon (what you should do), I sent it to repair. When I finally got it back, it was working fine except for one little thing... Audio and Video were out of sync. Sadly I can't return it on amazon now since it is passed the 30 day mark, I can only hope the repair center can fix this."
2,"Good picture, terrible support","This unit exhibits good picture quality. However, the firmware is out of date and it does not support HDMI audio. Samsung website offers a firware update, but there are no instructions for installation. The update fies are in a format difficult to use. Hopefully, newer models will enjoy better support."
1,Do not waste your money - stick with a progressive scan,"I was hoping this DVD player would be different but again I was disappointed. It does have a nice design BUT...DVD-R's seem to be the most difficult DVD's to play. It did play some BUT not all of them. I have read about how you cannot create a readable backup DVD-R or cheaper DVD-R's cannot be read. I found this to be untrue. When I purchased another Samsung DVD player (progressive scan model) it had no problems playing any of my DVD-R's.The second problem is the upconvert process. I have a Hitachi Ultravision, and I saw no difference when upconverting, even with a Monster HDMI cable. After speaking with several individuals, allegedly knowledgeable about this subject, I found that the upcovert, when it does work, doesn't make any significant impact."
2,Not Good Overall Value,"The 941 has extreme problems with its Firmware. The product was defective from the manufactuer, the audio leaks in and out Via HDMI. Samsung will tell you to upgrade the Firmware but, that doesnt fix the problem at all. The up Conversion factor is barely visiable even at 1080i. Product needs drastic improvments with HDMI and up conversion resolution."
5,Better than I expected,The picture in HDMI 1080i mode is great no matter what DVD I put in it. It also is playing picture CD/DVDs that my old Toshiba DVD would not. My Yamaha surround receiver has only one digital input in it and I found that it gave the most dramatic improvement to my Comcast Cable Box. So I'm using regular audio component cables from the DVD to the receiver and the sound is still as good or better than the digital cable sound. I bought this model because the reviews on the cheaper Samsung model were lukewarm at best. I think this was the correct model to buy.Ordering from Amazon was easy and it appeared on my doorstep in two days.
3,Not a review,"As of November 5th, 2004.This is not a review... SamsungUSA's website actually does list this under the current hi-def DVD players, but is not available for purchase yet. The HD-931 is the player listed under the archived players.However, no word yet as to when this player will be released."
3,Good,"He used alot of sources that were not orginally his and he actually admits he does a good job of taking information and condensing it and putting it all together, after reading the intro I wonder how much of the work is really his. However the section on how to heal things like, burns is hilarious and I wonder how the poor victims of this cure turned out."
5,Beyond the cartoon character...,"This is a stunning retrospective of Hitler, his origins, and his methods of seducing the German people. The video demonstrates that above all, Hitler was a political genius, a master showman, and a madman. Most people shrug off Hitler as an evil, one-dimensional cartoon character that could never dupe today's ""sophisticated"" masses. This documentary shows this to be a dangerous assumption."
3,You have to speak German to get full value of these tapes.,"I was really looking forward to getting this video, as the advertisig for it promised to deleiver an in-depth view of Hitler in his own words, and in the context of his own times.Unfortunately, substantial portions of this video are taken from archival footage of Hitler making lengthy speeches in German, without subtitles. If subtitled translations were included this would easily have been a ""4"" or ""5"" star video series. But without them (and not being fluent in German) all that was left to see was a crazed madman gesticulating and using vocal inflections. The result is that one draws the exact opposite conclusion to the one advertised, namely that Hitler was indeed just a 2 dimensional cartoon character.That is certainly not the proper hisorical lesson to draw, so the video series fails, in my opinon."
5,insightful and descriptive .....the very best on Hitler,"this series not only gives you an overall history into the life of Hitler,but breaks down his ""modus operondi"""
3,great book but not well made,"my daughter loves this pop up book, but two different pages broke on the very first try. they are not easy to glue and tape back down either."
4,You Gotta Love It!,I caught his stand up special on television by accident and I LOVED it. I bought a copy and can't wait to watch it again.
3,REUSED JOKES!!!,I've loved Aries Spears since before MadTV but he greatly disappointed me with this because of reused jokes. I did manage to laugh once or twice but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I rated it a three because I'm still a fan but I really hope he comes harder with the next (if there is one). The ending skit was kind of funny but still not really all that. It's REALLLLLLLLLLYY been done to death.
5,awesome,"has all the episodes youve been looking for and includes the pilot. also lots of neato commentary. if youve been toying with the idea of buying, live it up!"
5,Love off beat satire.,I THINK THAT THIS IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING SHOW IN THE ADULT SWIM CARTOON LINE UP.
4,The Venture Bros. - Seasons One and Two,This was purchased as a gift and it arrived very promptly. Good job by all.
2,Styling and Quality Make This One a Loser,"Somehow the engineers at Sylvania managed to make an LCD television look like my grandfathers black and white TV - complete with chrome sticker, two tone finish, and bare-bones remote control. I would tolerate this and call it ""retro"" if the picture quality was good. Unfortunately the picture is very grainy and is much brighter at the edges. As much as I hate returning electronics, this will be going back. Last time I buy a TV without seeing the picture quality in person."
1,not what I expected,The author seemed to only want to get across how much information he knew. ugh. I put it down after reading two chapters and never picked it back up. I was expecting something like Anderson Cooper's book about being a reporter. I was wrong.
3,"Nice, but......","The bib works really well at absorbing baby drool, however it has a very bad motor oil smell.... I have washed it several times and although the smell has lightened, it isnt something I would want to wear and smell around my neck all day... So I'll continue to wash and hope the smell vanishes so i can use it for my drooly baby."
4,Only One Star for this download,"This is not the original album. I have the LP purchased in the 70's. The songs have different running lengths from my LP, AND there are lyrics sung in Rocket Man. This version is much shorter and just has Rapp humming to the instrumental track of Rocket Man."
3,"Good songwriting, distracting vocals","The songs have a similar feel and sound to Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter. However, one thing that really distracts me is the apparent lisp that is present in quite a few of the songs (such as God Save The Child). If not for that lisp, this would be a 5 star album for me. After many listens, I still can't help but brace myself for it, as the vocals are pushed forward in the mix.Do note that, as of this writing, the tracks are mislabelled in the MP3 album download - the tracks appear in the normal running order, however the titles are one track early (ie the real Rocket Man is titled God Save The Child, etc.)."
3,Just okay,"The set is beautiful, but it doesn't appear to be holding up very well. The smaller one has been used a few times for baking, and the finish on the inside is starting to flake away. I would avoid using them for baking. They still make great serving dishes."
4,Excellent general introduction to herpetology,"This books provides great info for snakes and their physiology, as well as taxonomy/classification. The main thing I found lacking was information on specific species; though it cover family/genus info fairly well, I felt it forsook the ""trees for the forest."" But overall very good."
3,encyclopedia of snakes,"I am not reviewing this book just can find no where to write a review of the site. in the memory you use to put the larger photos on you could put the table of contents and samples in the book. i see no virtual review of the book, nothing about it, no number of pages, no table of contents nothing. so therefore i will not buy from this site. i dont buy what i cant see or have no clue what the contents of the book is. this book is only a book of snakes not sure if it contains what i want or not. all i have a title that is all. titles dont sale books unless one is looking for a specific title."
5,Adapter works fine,"I bought this because the end connector on my old adapter would connect fine as long as the wire was oriented a certain way, but if you moved the computer, then it would lose the connection and before you knew it the battery was drained. This new one works great."
1,Disappointing,"Gypsies of Russia repeats the same melancholy airs in tune after tune. The gypsies were also passionate people who loved life, but this is not reflected in the CD"
1,Not pleasing,"I saw these shoes online and thought, why not. So I gave Reebok the benifit of the dought, after all they did woo Henry. Anyways, the boot does not support your ankle because it did not lace high enough. I felt like I was going to turn my ankle constantly. Also the shoe falls appart quickly. The toe material and the external heel shell started seperating from the molding on just the third time wearing them.The material was about the only thing going for the shoe. The leather was soft and supple and molded to my foot quickly. Over all I wore these shoes just over 2 months and had to replace them. I will steer clear of Reebok futbol boots from now on. At least the shoe looks good.....for a bit:("
2,"Williams doesn't have his own ""voice""","While it is capable of producing an exciting ""sound,"" Williams' music lacks the depth and originality found in truly timeless work. His fanfares provide the listener with a certain Pro tem, but as time passes so has Williams'. He gave us something inventive in the 70s, when he was at his creative peak. Today, is it difficult to discern which is more indifferent, the music or the listener? What about the many fans of Williams, myself included? He is my reason for studying music. Nevertheless, like the composer, we should stop screaming from center stage. Fellow music lovers, if you keep buying albums, they will keep hiring the same composer. Allow a newer composer, an unheard ""voice,"" to speak."
4,Classic John Williams,"You can hear many of Williams's previous themes from films re-appearing as different pieces on this CD. However, the themes are so wonderfully melodic and soaring that you just don't mind. Go out and add this one to your collection!"
2,disappointed,"could have purchased at wal-mart for half the price after shipping etc. also not as ""violet"" as I had hoped."
1,It's Toxic...,"I just figured out why I have been sweating so much, I could not even lift a finger without pouring sweat. I started using this product last week and was just sweating like crazy at work and feeling very uncomfortable, I had yesterday off and used my regular bar soap and worked around the house and had no problems with sweating, then today I wanted to smell nice at church and put on a little dab of this product and immediatly after drying off I noticed a burning sensation and started sweating just like all week. I know every body is different, but I looked up the ingredients with google and was amazed at how toxic the ingredients are and how bad the MSDS reports are on these items. I have since bathed again with my bar soap and feel better and not sweating. I hope this helps someone out there..."
1,Cheap plastic doors break,"This space shuttle was great, for a week. Then the first bay door broke off with very little use. The 2nd door soon followed. Cheap cheap cheap.It's also disappointing that the astronauts can't fit in the space shuttle. What fun is that?"
3,toy,"My son didn't like it too much and he is obsessed with space. He's 5 and just wasn't that into it. He said it was cool, but he thought it was for bigger kids."
2,Not great.,"My 3 1/2 year old has been asking me for a rocket ship for some time now. This one had great reviews, and was well priced, so I ordered it.It's fine, he likes it well enough, but I was disappointed.The body of the shuttle has two 'doors' that open. They don't sit flush when they are closed and therefore overlap slightly.Also, the astronauts do not fit in the shuttle which really doesn't make sense.It's a little bit heavy, and because it's made of metal I worry that it could be dangerous if someone is too rough with it, especially the pieces that come to a point.I wouldn't buy it again, and I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Is not all metal, plastic bay doors broke first time being played with",90% of the space ship is made out of metal and made well. Unfortunately that 10% which is made of plastic is the part which should have been made out of a more durable material. The first time my kids played with the shuttle they broke the hing of the plastic bay door off. These hinges are not only made of plastic but very poorly made. There is no feasible way fix the hinge as the little nubs are just too small to glue back on.I only recommend this product for older children/adults who will only use it as a display piece. Any amount of play and it will break very quickly.
4,Not as durable as thought,"Saw a previous review on the construction of the toy, which made me choose it for by 5 year old. It is a great little replica, and a lot like one my brother had when we were little. My son loves the space men, too.Unfortunately, the doors on the shuttle, the arm that comes out of the shuttle and the landing gear are all plastic, not die case. The doors don't close tight to each other either, and the arm detaches easily (read: will be lost soon). So, I am not sure about the longevity of the toy, but he does love it. So does my 3 year old.Update: 2 years later, the doors and arm are broken and gone, but it is still a favorite toy around here. If there was one with all metal, I would get it, but the kids still like it."
2,It's OK,"5 year old son asked for this from Santa. He got it. But hasn't touched it at all except for the first hour. I think it's ok. The lack of noise or lights or action bores the child easily I guess. He's not a demanding kid when it comes to toys but there has to be something in it for him. He quickly ditched this and went back to his Legos because while those don't generally have lights or sound or action, at least it gets his creative juices flowing and he can have fun the good old-fashioned way -- by pretend play. But there's not much you can do with rockets that don't make any sounds or give off light. Oh, and one of the components broke too within the first hour."
3,"Cute toy, but durability is an issue.","Bought this for our youngest son for his fourth birthday as he's really into space and spaceships. We got a wonderful reaction from him when he opened it up and he played with it like crazy the first night. The body is solidly made, but the auxiliary parts (opening bay doors) popped off the same night and he found the landing wheels to be too difficult to open on his own (he's pretty strong for a four year old). Everything else that came with it was fine; I'd rate the appearance of the space shuttle a 5, but durability around a 2 unless your kid is going to treat it like a museum piece. He's still playing with it though, despite the broken pieces, so it wasn't a total waste."
2,"Disappointing! Doors don't stay shut, can't fit anything in it","My son desperately wanted a space shuttle for his 4th birthday so I put this on his wishlist based on the good reviews. Unfortunately, he was sorely disappointed. The cargo doors keep flapping open so he got very frustrated that it would not fly with its doors shut. Also the cargo bay is too small to really put anything in. The stand and flag are useless to him. He has not touched it since the day he opened it. Save your money."
1,They are shipping no-name brand junk now...,"Clover was shipping good cameras in 2007. Seems like somewhere thereafter they stopped their own line but are maintaining these posts at Amazon. Pure deception.Or bait-and-switch you may call it. Now they are shipping no-name brand junk.Description says power adapter is included. You will not get one.The junk they are shipping now does not work in low light, like the original ones did. So save your time and efforts..."
3,good for fans of jack johnson and ben harper,"Do you like Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, or G. Love? Hawaii's independent folk-rock artist, Micah Wolf, gives a refreshing melodic sound familiar to Jack Johnson fans and the like. Micah Wolf started his own record label to release his debut album that is full of acoustics and soulful lyrics giving an impression of ""honest, tender, and quirky"" musicianship. Songs that do stand out are ""Self-Esteem"", ""Pay No Mind"", ""Burden"" and ""Tease Me""."
1,AP,"I understand how obviously things will be different when you come home to a family you had skipped out on for years. But, to see your brother dating your ex wife? I think that is WRONG! Not to mention how messed up the kids will be. That's my stepdad/uncle. I could understand if Walter (Eric la Salle) had died, but he was alive. Aren't there rules about this? For example: You don't hit on or date your best friend's ex girlfriend. Were they already divorced? I don't quite remember if they were divorced before he came home. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the brother had a thing for the wife to begin with. I know things are changing but still..."
5,thought provoking,"I've always been a sucker for books about gifted teens, but usually they are gifted in music. I found the combination and comparison of chess and ballet fascinating. The author doesn't fall for any of the easy traps like trying to make a love story here - though it is not that her teens are uninterested in sex or that they don't sense the possiblity of each other. She shows that becoming the best at anything involves a price and only we can decide if that price is worth it. Sometimes the alternating first person narrative, was a little hard to follow, but ultimately this was a satisfying book"
2,The Kings Are Already Asleep,"After reading My Heartbeat, a quick and enjoyable, though easy, read, I was expecting a similar quality out of The Kings Are Already Here. I wanted to like the characters; I wanted to feel for their situations. Yet they seemed so two-dimensional: Phebe questioning her ballet, Nikolai searching for a lost chess master. They didn't seem to have any other qualities, and I couldn't feel any sympathy for them. In other words, I guess they just seemed bland. Pencilled outlines on paper.The story itself was equally uncompelling, although perhaps I just wasn't the right reader for the book's story line. I found myself finding excuses not to pick up the book and keep reading, always a bad sign. I never finished it.When Ms. Freymann-Weyr's next book comes out, I hope to find myself drawn to it as I was to My Heartbeat. Yet there are different books for different people, and perhaps I simply wasn't the right person for The Kings Are Already Here."
5,"For a really clean, smooth shave..",Great product makes returning to the shaving brush a good experience. I get closer shaves and my blades last much longer with Truefitt and Hill.
2,"B careful, Not Army Digital","Be careful, u are not buying army digital. great vest but it is shipped OD green. They should do something about this. NOT ARMY DIGITAL."
2,"some good, mostly forgetable or bad","let's go ahead and skip past the usual global underground marketing hype. yea so Danny Howells thinks about music all the time, that is a huge suprise given that he DJs for a living.simple focusing on the music on these CDs - there are some very good tracks. a few of them. but there are also a few extremely terrible tracks. i guess i don't kind 7 minutes of a endlessly repeating 2 second loop to be good music. some of the tracks are just pure garbage. anyone who listens to mix CDs knows that a bad track just kills the flow. it's not like being in the club when you can just take a break, get off the dance floor and get another drink.bottom line: if Danny Howells comes to your town, go see him. buy his Renaissance CD which is very good. skip this one."
4,Lotta music for the bang!,"Great buy from Amazon, lotta music in this CD. Dance, trance and good tunes.....it's all good!"
5,Very Very Nice,"What a pleasant surprise this ""24:7"" thing is, in fact,it's great. If you're like me and like your music asvocal-free as possible...good news! On the fantastic2nd CD, which really (and I mean this in a good way)kicks your [butt]---of 13 tracks, a whopping 10 are vocal-free!The deep bass beats really work your sub-woofer and thetracks are very creative and satisfying. The first CD hasgood tracks as well, but that second CD's where the actionis. Hey what's with this new shape to the jewel box?It doesn't fit in any conventional CD slot. Kinda kewl.Anyway, I give this latest thang by Mr. Howells my highestrecommendation. One last bit of advice...if you really wantto love this music, I strongly suggest that you play the secondCD first."
5,incredible imagination,"this is not hoffman's best written book, but that is a minor drawback, since her second best is still better than many other author's. if you think of the exposition being a form of writerly shorthand, so to speak, it isn't such an issue.the wonderful thing about this book is the world building. the families, their history, their talents are completely thought-out, made to seem completely real. behavior, actions, reactions, all ring true to life.just fyi, in case any of the previous reviewers review, and for new readers, there is a semi-sequel, _the silent strength of stones_. now, if hoffman would only write a THIRD installment (and forth, fifth, etc.)."
4,A good read,"I enjoyed this book when I read it, however it shows signs of being a little too rushed at times and some of the characters are paper thin. However as I am a fan of ""Urban Fantasy"" it did appeal greatly"
2,"Great title, but dissapointing content","The book grabs the reader with an interesting title then immediately starts off with a look at a boring movie and then reviews of even more boring competing therories. Finally the authors reveal the information ecology therory. Unfortuanately, the don't offer much to back up their view and paint a picture of it being another feel good PC therory. Too bad since they have a valid point that will sadly be lost as another PC mistake..."
3,Not very many strips,"I enjoy comic strips, especially ones that have art as beautiful as Gus Arriola's ""Gordo."" This book gives an extensive biography of Arriola, along with extensive commentary by the biographer, Robert Harvey. Once I got past Harvey's writing, I enjoyed the book. Unfortunately, there are very few strips reprinted in the book. Harvey merely samples ""Gordo"" strips, putting his unnecesary commentaries in the margins, inbetween pages of prose. I think most people, like me, would prefer to have just a collection of the strips, so that we can enjoy Arriola's wonderful work without the ""help"" of a commentator."
4,Very nice.,Bought this for my son to use for his Bible class in school. It has been useful to him in helping him with his journal that he is required to do.
4,Parent and child approved,Good content that really speaks to teens. How good was it? My daughter couldn't help herself and stop reading so she read it more like a novel and was done in a week. Maybe make the next one more boring <grin>.
4,Devo Book,My son says this book is pretty good. It is easy to read. He said that it would have been more appropriate for him as a home schooled student if there were more applications for kids in his social situation.
3,"Devotions....good, but not for a classroom","I am not thrilled with the book. The questions are not very deep and the kid's are not responding as well as I had hoped. As well, I don't like that it refers to a start day and assumes you began on January 1st. I am attempting to utilize it in a classroom setting, but I have to skip various devotions."
3,We are all Devo!,"Other excellent DEVOs that I have found: Freedom of Choice, New Traditionalists, and Duty Now For The Future. May you be touched by his Spudness."
5,Humorous Sci-Fi,"More of a socio-political statement on how humans behave. Very humorous book. Not science oriented like M. Crichton, but on the same intelligence level. I was afraid to lend out my copy until I saw that it was still available. Point of view in the story is from the alien invaders and it's a fairly quick read (short story and very well written). Plan on getting some other books by this author after seeing the availability."
3,Novel based on short story ... still funny but ...,"The short story ""Pandora's Planet"" on which this novel is based makes up the first chapter or so of the book. It's hilarious. I remember reading it in my youth and thinking it was one of the funniest things I'd ever read. When it came out as a full-length novel I found that the gag did not really stretch very effectively to the longer format, unfortunately. The humor became labored and somewhat repetitious. And the weird hook for a follow-on at the very end was never, to my knowledge, fulfilled."
2,Keeps pulling and wasting the bags,"Ugh! I do not know what's happening with this thing. I've had it for about a year, but the last two replacements were wasted when the wheel pulled out too much and it wound around it. I would pull it open to find a loooooong empty blue bag and at the end wound around the wheel and a little bit of litter at the very end. It's just a pain in the butt to shake the litter to the actual end, and then cut off a large amount of the bag (therefore wasting it and having to replace it earlier).I had hoped that cutting it and resetting the ""new end"" would fix the problem, but no. It just keeps pulling too much of the bag and wasting it. Yes, it keeps the smell from permeating the room, but it still is wasting the bag and my money. I'm tempted to throw the whole thing out and forget it."
1,Stinkier WITH the Litter Locker,"This product did not work for me at all. Our litter box is in a smaller room in the house and odor can get trapped very easily. The litter locker was a pain to use, and somehow, odor escaped from inside. I threw it away after a few weeks and bought a little trash can with a lid. Much Better! Not stinky and easier to deal with."
2,"Good idea, bad construction","For what this company charges not only for the litter locker itself but for the plastic bag refills, there's no excuse for its flimsy construction. After only a few uses the unit would not wind completely anymore, easily getting stuck. Bags would also easily break, dumping cat waste into the unit itself. The problem is, this unit can not handle several days worth of cat waste without getting jammed - and if you have more than one cat, forget about it. It's easier just to invest in some cheap kitchen trash bags - wasteful to be sure, but easier than having this unit fall apart on you."
5,the best thing since apple pie,I bought this product with my last $25.00 one week over a year ago. I couldn't decide should I or shouldn't I ...........I'll wait untl next week ...........but when is there ever a next week...........so I just bought it and let me tell you it is the best 25.00 I ever spent. I have a clan of Ragdolls that travel with me ....to work ...to play ......and everywhere......... I couldn't do with this product...and it is still working great after all this time .............this product is a god send for us traveling ragdolls...............thanks Alexandra Purcell
1,Don't Buy It!!!!,"The Refill Bags are Grossly overpriced for what you get. Check the price of Refills. The Litter Locker is designed to use the maximum amount of refill bag. The ""cutter"" is placed as far away from where it is needed as possible.Had I Know how wasteful this product is, I would not have bought it. I tried to give it No Stars, the review process requires at least 1.Besides That, If you don't care about cost and waste, It works"
2,not really odor-free,"Sorry, but I can still smell the odor. Plastics absorb odor. After a couple of weeks the smell permeated the whole contraption. Also, the tube/bag thing doesn't last as long as they say. I dump baking soda in with the poop every time, which seems to help. Otherwise, it's not worth the money."
2,Recommended with reservations,"I loved my litter locker for about 2 weeks. I always clean the litter box right before I run out the door to go to work and compared to using a plastic bag everyday. this is much more efficient/convenient. It really does trap odour.If I had to do it over, I wouldn't purchase it:1. poor quality--the sides of the locker are very flimsy2. after 2 weeks it sometimes gets stuck (I have to bang the sides to get the handles to turn3. if it is used once a day everyday for 1 cat, it will not last more than a month4. it's kind of disgusting disposing of the waste once the cartridge is empty5. cost of refills add upI would only recommend this if you don't mind spending the money to replace the cartridges."
3,Petmate litterlocker,I have this one and the Lucky Champ. This one works better to me. Oder is my concern. This one keeps out oder better than the Lucky Champ. I have lots of money invested in both. Neither one is super great for oder but Petmate won out. I like the ease of the Lucky Champ but thats not my concern. Its the ODER.
2,Not for multi-cat households,"I can see that this might be a fine contraption for single cat homes. However, I have 3 cats and scoop the box 2-3 times a day, which means the Locker gets emptied avery 2-3 days, NOT weeks as stated. This method wastes a great deal of plastic & no matter how careful we are a LOT of litter ends up on the floor. Granted, the used litter doesn't smell but neither does throwing out the bag every day. If anyone wants a clean but gently used Locker - let me know!"
5,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful invention, why did I wait so long? I have three cats and this solves the disposal problem. I clean once a day and the first cartridge lasted a little over three weeks. It's simple, clean, and no odor!"
1,Worst Product on the Market,This product is everything you DON'T want in litter disposal. It is not well constructed and broke after less than two months of use. The bag continually broke when I emptied it and flies circulated around this product. Buy the Litter Champ instead as it's a much better product.
1,Bags will tear!,"The bags in this contraption will tear once it starts filling up, making you have to clean the whole thing, which is not very fun. Ended up throwing the thing away because it was more trouble than it was worth."
1,nice idea. poor execution,"There's supposed to be a little button on the front that locks the top and bottom portions of the box together. The plastic was molded poorly, so mine never connects and can't lock properly. Hence, trying to pick the unit up results in the thing falling apart. I lived with this for a month or so. The bag ran out, so I had to buy a replacement. The bag replacement is so poorly designed that turning the wheel never exerts enough force to pull out any more bag. Now I'm out $25 for the box, plus $9.99 for the replacement that didn't work. What to do now? Risk buying another replacement? Or just junk this piece of trash? Learn from my mistake; save your money."
5,Great idea for apartment dwellers!,"I live in a small space with a big cat! In the winter (which is sometimes long and hard in Upstate New York), it isn't always convenient to take out the ""litter trash"" every time I clean the cat box (usually twice a day!) The Litter Locker keeps the ""poop"" and the smell contained and my diva type cat very happy! A good investment, albeit maybe a bit expensive for refills if you have multi cats and use it as frequently as I do. All in all, a good investment for me."
5,"Love, Love, Love this Product!!!","We've had multiple cats for years and have tried every litter system on the market (LitterMaid, Booda Box, etc.) This is the best system so far! We've had it a little over a month and haven't experienced the problems the folks who gave it a low rating experienced. We currently have 4 cats and three litter boxes and even though I was very diligent about scooping the litter boxes every day (sometimes more than once a day) there was still a lingering stinky odor. Since we started to use the Litter Locker, the stinky odor problem is gone! It's so good I've just ordered 2 ten-packs of the bag refills! I highly recommend this system for litter box odor control!"
4,Works well,"I've had the Litterlocker for about a month now and it works very well. I gave it 4 stars due to a poor fit between the top and bottom half of the unit. Despite the poor fit, the unit works exactly as advertised. I don't smell any cat litter odors coming from the unit. Disposing of the litter from inside the unit is easy."
2,not what I thought it was,"I misunderstood what this product was. I thought the anti-microbial cylinder was a disk that went in the middle of the waste bin, but it's actually a disk that dispenses anti-microbial trash bags. If I'd known this, I would have saved my money and bought a small step-can and some scented trash bags. Now I'm kind of mad that I have to keep buying special refill bags because this thing isn't designed to take regular trash bags."
4,"does the job, diaper genie for cats","Allows you to clean the litter box without the daily trip to the garbage can. I notice no odor even when the thing is close to full. Only drawback is figuring out how to carry the heavy spiral of bagged cat mess to the garbage bin. I suggest using a plastic grocery bag or carrying the LitterLocker out to the bin before cutting the plastic. Great product. Thinking of buying a second one for our second litter box. The refills are way cheaper on amazon.com and last 2 months for one cat, making it affordable."
5,Love It,"This product is amazing. I have 3 cats and have been using the litter locker for about a year. I have 2 of them and they both work great. I used to use a little lidded trash can and every time you opened it up - oh gosh! the smell was overpowering. To those writing reviews that had trouble with their locker, you must have gotten a defective one because I have never had mine stick or work improperly. I only have to reload the cartridges every month or 2. Sure beats having to open that trash can every day. This product has been a true nose saver. I highly recommend it."
4,Good product flimsy design,"I was planning on giving this product a bad review. However, when I read the instructions and other reviews I learned a few things. First, I needed to empty it every two weeks. Second, the reason it was coming apart was because I did not empty it enough. Once I learned these tips, I decided that it is a pretty good product. It definitly traps in odors and beats going out to the trash every night. I find it easy to use and convenient. It gets 4 stars because it is flimsy."
4,Automatic litter pan replacement,"Having had a couple of expensive Littermaids die in the saddle, I was chary of this device except that it wasn't motorized and it was considerably cheaper.We LOVE it. As long as you make a good firm knot in the end of the bag and don't overfill, the bag is exceptionally durable and holds an amazing amount of poop and clumps.Only 4 stars because the sides are a little too flexible/not sturdy enough and the darn thing needs some sort of handle. Otherwise, a good way to deal with nasty stuff."
2,Not quite what I thought...,"I used the litter locker for about a month before finally disposing of it. I was under the impression that it actually sealed in between turns, but it doesn't quite do that. The product works just fine, but I found that removing the tube of waste every other week and having to retie the end each time to be a pain. I'd rather just use a bathroom-sized garbage can with a lid and change out the bags weekly."
1,Gnats!,We used this for a couple of months and our house became gnat central. We got rid of it and the gnats went away.
5,Great to have in multi cat households or bad weather,"I love, love, LOVE the Litter Locker. As others call it, it's like a ""diaper genie"" for cat litter boxes.I found during recent years here in South Florida, that it was VERY helpful to have a Litter Locker at each litter box during hurricanes. When your cats are a. cooped up inside before, during, and after storms, b. using their boxes much more, and c. nervous/anxious/upset, a clean kitty box is a must. AND when there is no trash pickup after storms, and you don't want kitty poop baking in the sun or sitting in a trash can around your home, it is also welcome. I would think the same would be true in cold, winter climates, also.For my household, it is such a Godsend. I have 6 cats, and it is always a handy gizmo to have. Makes cleaning kitty litter boxes so much easier, quicker, convenient, and my cats are happy too."
5,Awesome!!!,For years I've been using used plastic grocery bags for litter disposal. Gone are the days of searching for a bag without a hole in the bottom and carrying a stinky bag out to the garbage every day!! This sits right by my litter box and makes life so much easier. Highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't feel like taking the garbage out everyday. It contains all odors and for my one cat household I only have to empty it every week and a half or so. I've had it for almost a month and still have not had to buy a refill for the bags. All in all I would absolutely recomend this to every single indoor cat owner!
5,Best thing EVER!,"My husband and I were living in an apartment and were tired of having to take a bag of trash out to the dumpster every time we cleaned the litter box. We tried bagging it and putting it in our trash but the smell was horrible. We saw the litter locker at the pet store and thought it would be a good solution to our problem. This is one of the best things we have ever bought for our cats! It is so nice to clean the box and then just close the lid and twist the bag...just like a diaper genie! There is no smell and it is easy to empty and refill the bags! Great, great, great buy!"
3,Refill used up within less than two weeks!,"We only have one cat but I'm quite fastidious about cleaning his litter box and do so almost every time he uses the litter box, which is between 3-4 times a day. I was expecting the refill to last at least one month but it was used up within 10 days! That's expensive as it costs $8 per refill plus taxes. So I'm cleaning the litter box once a day now and I'll be looking out for the Diaper Genie at Wal Mart."
3,Kind of wasteful,"Got this, thought it would be a great way to make cleaning the cat box easier for the kids. The problem is that the cartridges are expensive, and I felt that quite a bit of the liner was wasted when you had to pull it away from the roll, and cut it on the cutting blade inside the container. Then you have to pull more out and knot it, and hook it inside. When you tied off the filled bag, almost double the length was wasted. If you empty the container when it is full, it adds up. Would be best for someone in an apartment or who had difficulty getting outside regularly."
5,some general tips...,"the litter locker is great, i keep it next to my omega paw litter box which i also highly recommend. i got mine online at a large chain pet store...its basically a spool inside, and each turn of the wheel wraps the bag into this spool. think a garden hose...most folks complain the refills do not last. hopefully they are not tossing them when they empty the device. the biggest problem is that the ""spool"" of litter will become too big to spin inside the locker, and most people may think they have to empty it and totally replace the refill.you can actually just empty the spool once a week or every 2 weeks, just do not replace the bag refill until it actually empties! simply cut the bag and toss the litter, tie it off and then use the same refill again until it runs out.i expect to get around 6 weeks out of each refill with this method for 1 cat, maybe longer."
1,Piece of junk,"So we are a 4 cat household and thought the litter locker would be just the thing for keeping down odors with multiple scoops per day. We used it for three days and it fell out of the round track, it leaked litter all over, and it stunk up the bathroom worse than an open litter box. Maybe this would work well for a single cat home, but for several it's not worth the investment. Plus, they're not made well. The plastic is cheap, the parts barely fit together, and nothing holds in the odor with the plastic bags. We've decided to go with a diaper genie. At least those twist off the ""deposits"" and keep the stench from spreading."
4,Fun,"Fun puzzle, although the pieces didn't lock together as well as I would've liked. I enjoyed the different sections and colors."
4,Side one review,"Adrian belew creates,more cool sounds than is believable, from one man ( and band ) originally was attracted to ""Matchless Man"" but all songs give a nice sonic relief to the kaleidescope that is my ipod.EnjoyGus"
4,Oh it's good!,"This record is a ton of fun. The music is different and very intelligent. My only gripe is the production. It sounds like it was recorded in someone's house. The instruments blur together a lot and it's annoying. But what is clear is very good, so I give it 4 stars. Still genius!! But *sigh*"
3,it was so-so...,"Aside from the first three songs, you can't really hear much that makes the power-trio a worthy thing, and the best songs, ""around the world"" and ""under the radar"" don't even feature those guys. Plus, King Crimson did better ""around the world"" kinda stuff, and ""under the radar"" is under two minutes. The 3 i gave this cd is a generous rating; in a month or so, i'll think much less of it."
3,Ho-hum,"Recognizing that Adrian Belew is one of the superior avant-garde players in action, this outing is a disappointment. OK, so you shouldn't judge a CD by its length, but 33 minutes? The album's potential is largely wasted on Crimsonesqe self-indulgence. That is for the first two tracks that open with Belew at his best, playing wammy-stretchy-Oh yes sir licks backed up by a stupendous rhythm duo. Why in God's creation he dumps the trio mode for the sake of demonstrating his so-so multi-instrumental aptitude totally eludes me. This CD could have been a juggernaut with Belew firmly at the helm. Instead it descends into an aimless abyss of spurious noise and Fripper-tronics. Five stars for tracks one and two. Two stars for the rest."
2,Something Different Is Not Always Better,"Belew is a fantastic talent, and anything he plays on will have a certain amount of quality. This album seems to be a bit experimental and filled with half baked ideas. The power trio is great but doesn't lend it's ear to what makes a Belew composition great. Melody has always been a key to his songwriting and there is none on this album. It sounds as if he came up with a bunch of jam parts and then forced vocals over the top of them. ""Beat Box Guitar"" is a nice intrumental that really builds towards the end but there is little else of much interest on the album. Most of the songs are fueled on noise or noisy sound effects which is different but not necessarily good. Plus for an EP length album that is sold at full album prices, I feel a bit ripped off. Maybe Side 2 will be better."
3,the idea is far from the deed...,"When i heard names such as Adrian Belew(King Grimson),Danny Carey(TooL) and Les Claypool(PrimUs), i thought that THAT would be a great concept album....but then, in a more experimental way, wasn't...If u like to buy something so u could hear something like TooL or Primus,buy TooL or Primus.This album has nothing to do with them.As for King Grimson,ok it could remind something...But i wonder,why these great artists won't create some more great Music.Although,respect,and 3 stars for the names.....Cheers*"
2,tool fans beware,"the music on this disc is fantastic. I was excited about the claypool carey teamup (admittedly not much of a prior belew fan)I have to say though, the lyrics on this disc seem arrogant and forced, this would have been better as an instrumental only disc.I think that when you team up some musical masterminds, you have to make sure it is a masterwork. This sounds like it was banged out in a short amount of time.maybe mr. belew needed a little extra cash : )"
4,Venture Bros.,"Great Amazon product! Sender could have packaged item more properly. DVD case arrived broken, but the DVDs worked."
5,always a good time.,I was turned on to Venture Bros. by my girlfriend. I must say I'm quite the fan now.
4,Brothers rule,"I'm enjoying my disks a lot and will be holding on to these for years, the only drawback was that all the bleeps and blurs are still part of the show. I had assumed that the words and content were blocked for broadcasting purposes but they are part of the shows. Still I am very happy with my purchase and can hardly wait for season three to become available. If you're a venture fan this is well worth getting."
1,Bad product,"Disc 2 does not work, so I technically paid full price for half of the season. It's not scratched, it's actually as if nothing was ever written on the disc."
5,Better than Season One!,"A great short cartoon series that was expanded to a fantastic 30 minute episode show. If you already own the first season of the show, then you get the joke. A great parody of the old Johnny Quest cartoons of the 60's.But season two takes that joke and takes it up to another level. If you want intelligent humor that if full of pop culture, great musical refences, and mindless violence. Then this is for you. If you are a true David Bowie fan , then you must see the final episode of season two. You won't regret it. If you are tired of the South Park, Simpsons, and Family Guy type of cartoon shows, then pick this up. In fact pick up all the Adult Swim cartoon sets if you need the change."
5,The Venture Bros. Season Two,The Venture Bros. - Season TwoLove the Venture Brothers!!! Takes me back to Johnny Quest but alot funnier!!
1,OK for headbangers -- not for Smiths fans,"It is deceptive that this listing does not have all of the songs/artists listed so that a purchaser can get a sense of what they are actually getting. This CD has nothing but hardcore punk covers of Smiths songs that all sound samey. Every song is revved up beyond belief and shouted over a pogoin' beat. That is fine for a one-off joke, but all of the subtleties that make the Smiths great are gone. If you weren't a Smiths fan in the first place, you would have trouble distinguishing between songs. Only the last track, a cover of Asleep, is slowed down to less that mosh tempo. No-name artists on a tribute album are expected, and it is nice to see that but what this bunch of punks obviously likes and appreciates one of the greatest bands of the 80s. But 60+ minutes of a pogoing soundtrack that has very very very little musically in common with its source material is NOT what Smiths fans will be expecting or looking for. Avoid."
5,The Lean Book for Lean,"What I found most beneficial in this book were the ready to use forms/worksheets/templates that I used with my lean team immediately. As a supervisor, this gives the structure for implementing lean, just what is needed, when it is needed. Lean design and very, very practical!"
5,Move Beyond Mapping...Value Stream Management,"Great basic, easy to follow plan for implementing lean. Takes us far beyond just the mapping craze. Highly recommended for small and large organizations."
1,misrepresentation,"Item description: 0.06 0z. Eau de Toilette Sampler Vial SPRAY, which means for 10.99$, (supposedly reduced from over 30$0...), you are buyinga tiny sampler (Free sample, not for sale is printed on the accompanying packaging), it`s not a spray either and the one I received was half empty.It is the sample you get free at any department store- 0.06 oz. is really a sampler (when it`s full)."
5,A broad sample of his works.,"These six posters by Cezanne each measure 31 X 44 cm. The paintings included are:-The Bay of Marseille, seen from L'Estaque-The Struggles of Love-Mont Sainte-Victoire, seen from Les Lauves-Group of Women Bathers-A Modern Olympia-Vessels, Fruit, and Cloth in front of a ChestThe protective cover includes French, English, and German commentary on each painting as well as a chronology of Cezanne's life. I highly recommend this faithful edition, which includes such merits as canvas texture detail and reasonable color reproduction."
3,God creates man to understand himself better.,"I had high hopes for this book, and indeed it was very interesting at first, however, it just dragged on with the same vignette repeated over and over again. Basically in this story, God creates man to understand himself better. He ends up helping us in various ways, so that man can understand his nature. That would have been interesting if it wasn't the same time and time again. The last few pages were almost interesting with God's interrogation of Mussolini, but that was even underdone."
1,Revisionist Historian,"A literary connect-the-dots of historic facts and fiction, blurred visions of spiritual beings, and endless babble about how wrong we all were in re-formulating history. Interspersed with refreshing elements of revolutionary ideas, the momentum soon diverts into clichee and the reader is left with a pile of pulp made soggy by tears of boredom. Chance encounters with spritual beings are downgraded to the most primitive element and the fun ends there. An all too human tale of a writer lost in a paralell universe, an Italian who couldn't cope with the generic and abstract landscape of the new world. Pity those who spend not only the money, but also the time..."
4,Whoah! Nostalgia!,"Reading this takes me back to time spent in my school's library poring over Gardner's columns in Scientific American. Several of the columns in this book I first read as a nerdy 14 year old and was staggered then (as I am now) by the elegance and beauty of the ideas they contained. Now I read it with a far greater appreciation of the problems and ideas expressed, but that doesn't compare with the sheer sense of wonder I experienced first time around."
3,Not as interesting as his earlier books,"I have long enjoyed reading Martin Gardner's books for their content of entertaining mathematical puzzles. Unfortunately, this volume is not as entertaining as the earlier books. The book takes thoroughness to the extreme, beating every issue to death and hence reading more like a textbook than a puzzle book. Further there is little diversity in topics - most chapters come from number theory or topology. Still you will find some interesting problems in this one: flatland, cannibals, taxicab geometry, checkers, the pigeonhole, and non-Euclidean geometry. Just don't plan to read everything or you will end up bogged down."
4,rockin' alien chick,Majandra has some of the most original music around these days I felt like I was in a Dido/Bjork whirlpool!
1,Too short and just too unoriginal...,"Nice try for an acting-music cross-over wannabe, but Majandra...this ain't gonna work...She must have been thinking,""How far can I go without people noticing I'm trying to imitate Tori Amos?"" and ""Lets make the lyrics as dark, depressing and suicidal as possible""...well, you definitely crossed the line of good taste, girl.Her performance on Roswell isn't already oscar-worthy, but if I were you, girl, I would stick to that, because the closest thing you're gonna get to a ""music career"" is a Jamie-Lynn Sigler lite.And sorry, but what's the deal with that cover!?"
1,Hoped it would be good but it sucks!,"If there are Grammy's for the the worst CD of the year then The Sicks might get a record number of nominations. From the worst produced CD to a horrible voice. Come on! As long as she has been working on this CD, couldn't she come up with some better music? I can't honestly say her voice is bad because with the poor production put into the CD would could really tell. If you want a good laugh then buy this CD. If you want to waste your money then buy this CD. If not say far away."
1,WHAT IS THIS!,"This is horrible! Majandra's vocals (which are pretty bad) are in need of some major help ... as do her lyrics.I had high hopes for this album after downloading the song ""Siren"" with its dark electronic feel but all that diminished upon listening to the repulsive ""Ski-Ming"" and ""Bruises"". All she sings about is wanting to manipulate and punish her spouse for no given reason which shows just how mediocre her writing skills are for it's all that she can think to write about. She's obviously not doing a very good job in expressing herself if all she has to reveal is her failed relationships. So given the fact that you can download 6 out of 8 tracks from various websites I suggest you do just that. Or better yet... Download ""Siren"" and then leave it at that."
1,bjork? portishead?........uhhhh no,"hearing all the comparisons, i was kinda excited to see what all the raves were about, but sadly she doesn't compare at all. umm..the people that claim that this music is like them is seriously kidding themselves..wishful thinking maybe because i was really hoping for another portishead trip hoppy type band/singer too...but c'mon have you guys even listened to them? there is absolutely no resemblance whatsoever!!!!!i just listened to the mp3s that amazon provided. Maybe the music, which i thought was tolerable, but the voice doesn't sound all trip hoppy or anything resemblying those two. For the song siren, it sounds like an evanesence clone and i really don't like them. After ""ski ming""..i kinda tuned out.So, bjork or portishead fans...STAY AWAY!! this is FALSE ADVERTISING."
1,Too short...too Tori Amos-like,"Well, what can I say...this album [neeeds help]...in all ways, the album features only six songs which are all very alike and sorry, but what's the deal with that cover!?Her performance on Roswell isn't already oscar-worthy, but if I were you, girl, I would stick to that cause the closest you will get to a ""music career"" is like a Jamie-Lynn Sigler lite."
5,I would totally recommend this cd,"I love this cd it is so personal to the artist Majandra Delfino and yes she is both a great artist and an actor. She has this flair that isn't pop or rock but somewhat techno and haunting at the same time. She also got me, when u listen to the lyrics weather personal from life experiences or just everyday issues she really ropes u in with her voice. I can say that as i listened to her sing on the show Roswell her performances of In the Air Tonight by Phil Colins and Paradise by the Dashboard by Meatloaf she goes outside of the box with those two classics. She again has that voice that is very haunting. I love this cd if u like all types of music then u should purchase this cd."
5,Honestly the best cd in a looooong time!,"This cd is for people who wants more of the songs than just music.It's for the once who listen to the lyrics and recognize themselfs.I would tell people who listen to The smiths, Sarah Mclachlan and cranberries to buy this cd.I just LOVE it!"
5,GREAT!!!!!,Majandra's music is the best...I can't wait till she comes out with a full record.. This is certainly not the kind of music you hear on the radio...But that's what makes it so great!!!
5,The Sicks = Excellent!,"I watch Roswell every week, and the day that Maria (Majandra) broke up with Michael, she sang a piece of a song as she played the guitar. Although it lasted about 10 seconds, I liked it. At the end, they mentioned that music was played from her album. So I went to her website and took a chance and ordered it. I never buy music. Ever.Not only was it a wonderful surprise, I found myself, and still find myself, listening to the CD over and over again. I hear my sister singing some songs, and my older brother, who is very much into hip hop only, wants a copy of the CD. It is highly recommended. Nuff said."
3,I prefer the first one,"This CD is good, but I really prefer other kind of music instead electronic one."
1,"Not Good, Not Good, Not Good!","This is the worst CD that I have ever purchased, and I have purchased some bad ones in the past, ie Sheakspears Sister. Will the producer's ever come to understand that most of us want music! Lyrics! Songs!!!!!"
2,No comparison,I was sadly disappointed with the season 2 soundtrack. I LOVE the show and have out played the season 1 soundtrack over and over again. But I must say that I was not impressed. I pre-ordered the CD knowing that I would love it...unfortunately I didn't.
4,"Not the first season soundtrack, but very good anyway.","I really love most of the songs on the album. There are maybe four that I don't listen to. It's not as good as their first, but it has a good mix of girl bands. Love the Dirtmitts, Le Tigre, BETTY, Shawn Colvin, Heart, Dusty Springfield, Iron and Wine, The Organ, and Ladytron isn't half bad either. I can always count on the L Word to introduce me to some amazing music. I am a 16 year old lesbian and have just been learning about the music of our culture for the past 3 years. I want more as other reviewers have said. They needed a two cd set for both cds to cover all of the wonderful music. And I wish Kinnie Starr would have sang on the show and been featured on the album again. I can't wait to see what music is in store for season 3, but I know I will most likely be adding that soundtrack to my collection too."
2,Mostly Mediocre.,"If you took most of the interesting parts and melodic sense of Sebadoh away, you'd have Snow Patrol, another average band blown up by the British hype machine. There's a few decent songs here: Chocolate, Run and Somewhere a Clock is Ticking, but this is adult contemporary for the younger set.Also watch out for the trite and over-literal lyrics, epitomized by 'Spitting Games'."
2,playin' it in the background while we shop,"For the 5 star fan: If you love this album, you REALLY should check out some music from the many artists that Snow Patrol's ""Final Straw"" has been compared to (ex: My Bloody Valentine's album ""Loveless"", Grandaddy, etc.) You may just discover a new new favorite band! As ""totally awesome"" as this album may strike you, a deeper dig into the indie archive will reward you ten-fold.I'm not surprised that so many people love this stuff. It's still more original and sincere than most ""brought to you by Abercrombie & Blockbuster"" radio.OK, how about 3 stars...in honor of the franchises that define our taste as well as our neighborhood's skyline."
3,Not for me....,Snow Patrol is an okay CD. I was actually disappointed that it was up to the high standards I had hoped it would be. I honestly I didn't care for it. I love the one single from it but other than that I was highly unimpressed and I looked for this CD for three months before finally finding it. It is an okay CD and the songs are nice but it is nothing compared to the single Spitting Games but for me that was not the case. It is not terrible but it also not what I thought I was. I suggest checking this CD out before you buy it.
5,their best album yet...,"Snow Patrol ups the wattage on their third full-length and delivers their best album yet. While frontman Gary Lightbody's lyrics are as melancholy and emotionally affecting as ever, they're driven home with a much bigger, more aggressively electric sound and an abundance of monster hooks. - Don Yates kexp.org"
3,"I've heard better, I've heard worse...","I gave this album three stars because the only songs that really stand out to me are Run, and How To Be Dead. I bought this CD based on my liking for those two songs, but then realized that those were pretty much the only ones that I liked. Not that the others are bad, they just don't strike me like the other two do. Run is without a doubt one of the most beautiful, well orchestrated songs I've ever heard. Snow Patrol is not a bad band, they are actally pretty good; I just don't deem this CD worthy of a five star rating, such as Jimmy Eat World's Clarity.It's true what they say about Gary Lightbody's voice, it's amazing. It has a softness like that of Trent Reznor (NIN) and a raw edge like Jim Ward (Sparta).I suggest downloading one or two songs first (gasp!) to see if you want the album. But not Run, because that song you'll like anyway."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"Apart from the standout tracks (chocolate, spitting games and run) which I really enjoy listening to, this album is quite banal. Perhaps further listenings will prove worthwhile but usually after 5 - 7 listens I've got a feel for an album and i'm unimpressed overall. That's just my opinion though."
5,Patrolling the snow,"On first listen songs that jump out are of course the beautiful ""how to be dead"" ""wow"" and the three singles placed together in a bunch. (The blissful anthemic rhythm of ""run"" sounds no less lush than it did all those months ago). But on a second or third listen new songs seem to jump out and grab attention. ""Somehwere a clock is ticking"" is a little less produced than some of the others but the vocals are pure from gary and iain and the song really grew on me. The twelve songs on the album (there are two bonus on mine though im not sure does that apply to everyone) are classics. Simple emotion from a broken relationship that really strikes a chord. The guitars are great, the melodies are heart melting and the vocals superb. Five stars."
4,The Patrol takes over,"an infectious and pleasing blend of hypnotic melodies, catchy hooks and moody lyrics.If you're into Keane, Coldplay, The Shins, Grandaddy, etc., you should probably get into this."
3,"Not Worth 5 Stars, But Is Worth 10 bucks.","First off, I definitely don't understand all the perfect 5 star ratings. This disc, even the most dedicated followers of SP can admit, is absolutely not at the same quality of a 'White Album' or 'OK Computer' or 'Moon and Antartica.'Just listen to the lyrics for two seconds. And its not that Lightbody isn't capable, the album shows a lot of his true talent, but sometimes, you have to wonder what he was...or...wasn't, actually...thinking. Its like he thought he only had to write solidly HALF the time.But, the album is certainly listenable. Everyone has mentioned 'Chocolate,' 'Spitting Games,' and 'Run.' There are definitely some good songs on here, but there are surely some missteps.Not the best album of the year, for sure. Not even the best album of the season (see: Modest Mouse 'Good News for People Who Loves Bad News'). But it IS worth 10 or 12 bucks. If nothing else, its harmless at least."
4,Another British Invasion--throw open the gates!,"If you are looking for something a little less edgy/electronica than Radiohead, a bit more guitar driven yet not as soaring as Keane, farther off the beaten path than Coldplay, and perhaps a bit more consistent than Elbow--Snow Patrol is for you.Though they bear similarities to each of the aforementioned (all of which I think are great, incidentally), they succeed in carving out a niche unique to themselves, all at once playful and melancholic, fun yet genuinely introspective. Catchy hooks, lovely melodies, and well-timed harmonies characterize the sound, which grows with each listen.This is the kind of album you must listen to uninterrupted two or three times during the first week you own it. I guarantee it will gain favor each time."
2,Blow Patrol,"Do you like Coldplay? Travis? South? Keane? Pilate? The Stills? Do you enjoy listening to the same stuff over and over again? Do you buy whatever genre is trendy at the moment? The monotonous third wave light rock with emo undertones is the new post-grunge tough-guy radio rock with possible Christian undertones, and it's quite hot right now. Do you watch the OC? Did you buy the soundtrack? If you answered yes to any of these questions, than this album is probably for you."
5,Amazing,"Gary Lightbody is a captivating singer with incredible tone and he brings this beautiful CD together. Every song is wonderful from the first track ""How To Be Dead"" to the last track ""Same"", with no let up in between. The instruments are bold and new with great effects and perfect harmonies. One of my favorite CDs of all time. Great band, great CD, get out and buy it."
3,"Good CD, not worthy of all the hype","I have listened to this CD a few times trying to get into the songs; although an interesting and above par listen, the majority of the songs are simply mediocre. I enjoy Run but don't see it as the break out song on the album. How To Be Dead found it's way to my heart with it's originality. If you own the CD already, have you ever turned up the volume at the beginning? You will notice that the band starts with a dial tone. Such creativity puts this album far above the junk that plays on corporate radio these days. Face it, Linkin Park couldn't play a good song if they were given the best song in the world and an outstanding editor. I have never understood the hype behind many of the awful bands of today. If you agree with this, you should check out Keane, The Shins, The Postal Service, or The Libertines. All of the aforementioned bands rock. Good luck with your musical endeavors."
3,Starting to feel the chills,"SP still had plenty of teen-aged blandness with their breakthrough major, but with focus on distilled balladry, a sincere beauty seeps into even the simplest of chord changes."
1,Derivative Drivel!,"Come on now kids! A masterpiece, fantastic ...blah, blah, blah..Haven't you heard of a band called SEBADOH? Snow Patrol is a complete rip off of this far superior and orginal band.I urge each and every one of you to listen to their back catalog and understand that Snow patrol are no more than a 'tribute band'."
1,I don't see what's so great about it...,"I bought this cd b/c a friend suggested it, and she told me that Snow Patrole's music sounds like Eisley's music...so I guess when I listened to this album I was dissapointed b/c I was counting on it sounding different and not having loud guitars and rock vocals. Maybe Snow Patrole has another album that's better."
1,"These boys are in the PRIME TIME now, baby!","Man, these bands today are sneaky. Sneaky GOOD! And smart, too! I mean, they call themselves rock bands, and radio stations call them rock bands, but in reality they are 3rd rate, talentless alt-rock/pop bands. Very, VERY clever and very wise. I mean, if enough of these ""sucky"" bands spew forth into the world and clog up the radio airways like a big wad of soap and hair clogs up the shower drain, then we may actually begin to think that this is what rock music actually IS, jack! And by the way, by ""sucky"", I actually mean ""sucky GOOD"". I mean if they weren't good, how else could these absolutely useless, musically-challenged, bad-song-writing losers get so much airplay?? Not to mention the big endorsements they received recently from Bill O'Reilly, the surviving members of the Ramones, and TV's hilarious Paul Riser of ""Mad About You"" fame.God bless you A&M; Records - you know a smart, good band when you hear one!! Keep up the good work, y'all!"
1,Don't blasphemize T Rex!,"This album is rather vanilla and bland and boring, and should never be mentioned in the same sentence as T Rex. T Rex is all about establishing a wicked boogie-rock groove and crooning over it like a glam rock superstar. This album doesn't set up any sort of groove, and definitely doesn't have a hint of glam in it, so just because one person said that a Snow Patrol song kinda sounds like the guitars in T Rex doesn't make it any better, because they don't, so get your own opinion! In fact, quit reading these reviews and buy Electric Warrior, because it's timeless!"
3,far from being the best album,"Although I love the ""Run,"" but I don't think it can be a best album of the year. I mean most of the songs are the same. I hate people always put a slow song as their last song. Common, It's freaking boring and uncreative. ""Run"" is the only great song. Some good songs before but the rest are bad and boring."
2,Bunch of students,"Why did it take a blatant (yet somehow effective)""yellow"" rip-off to get some sort of success? Have you no shame or what?I like parts of the album but overall this is mediocre stuff that's been done so much better by the bands they rip -off (My Bloody Valentine, Grandaddy, Sebadoh, you name it).File under ""where are they now?"" in 5 years"
4,Definitely worth purchasing.,"I can recommend this album unequiovocally, when one considers the price. It is not worthy of 5 stars, because some of the songs are merely decent, but there are some gems, and they alone are worth buying it for. As somebody else mentioned, tracks 5-7 are the best on the album - by a good margin. They are of a different calibre than the rest. Still, some of the other tracks, notably ""how to be dead"" are worth listening to more than once.I described this group to my brother as a knockoff of Coldplay - but a good knockoff, and something to tide a person over until Coldplay's next album. That may be ignorance on my part, since I'd never heard of Snow Patrol until about two weeks ago, but nobody should pretend for an instant that this group is up to par with Coldplay, though they remind me a lot of them. But when it's all said and done, you should still buy this."
3,a total mixture,"they aren't just like coldplay... but however they are a mixture of coldplay meets lifehouse. some songs are slower, but then some songs pick the beat up... rock a little more. overall, it's an alright album, but, i reccommend that you sample it first. do this because being that they don't sound like just one band... with one band's style, it could mean that your liking to it could be borderline if you're looking for one particular style. but i gave it 3 stars... just check it out, see what you think."
5,Call me geezer...,"Good record, really good record...with the exception of the fact that reading the other reviews makes me feel really old. Everyone compares these guys to bands like Coldplay, Radiohead, etc. I'd have to say that their roots go back a tad farther. Listen to the song ""Run""...hello, have none of you ever listened to Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb?"" Stop calling these guys a Coldplay knock-off...Coldplay IS a knock-off...Pink Floyd, U2, Radiohead...do your homework people. Bands have been making music for longer than critic darling Coldplay has been around."
2,A nice try...but no,"I bought this album about a year ago after hearng the song ""Run"" and thinking this would be another great British band like Coldplay. I was wrong.This cd is without a doubt, boring. The first track, ""How to be Dead"" sounds promising at the start, but the tune and the beat don't change! It keeps going for what seems like forever, even though it's only about 3:30. The lyrics are ok, but not great. People can relate to them, so that's why they appeal to some. The drummer needs work. A lot of work.When I listen to a cd, I like to listen to the whole thing through. WHen I listen to this particular cd, in my head I keep wishing it would end.Not all of the songs are terrible, songs such as ""Run,"" ""Chocolate,"" and some others are not bad, but if you're looking for a band you can truly enjoy go for something else and save 10 bucks."
3,"Unoriginal, Yet Charming","""Final Straw,"" Snow Patrol's mainstream effort, is a shining example of how a band can be almost too influenced by standard bands and artists. My Bloody Valentine, the Cure, Coldplay and others can be heard and instantly recognized throughout the album. While it never comes across as being a blatant rip-off, I can't choose to listen to ""Final Straw"" over it's apparent creators' albums.Never are the songs ""bad,"" they simply cause me to focus on other groups...which is something YOUR band should never do. It's one thing to be influenced by classics, but never mimic it."
5,"Wow, Run to the store and get this album..","or rather, ""add to cart"" on Amazon.com.I first heard about Snow Patrol in an article about possible summer 2004 anthems. I listened to the recommended song ""Run"", and was immediately struck by the chords and vocals. The song's sound is reminiscent of Coldplay's Yellow, but Snow Patrol are definitely not copycats; for one, they're catchier and brighter. In fact, the whole album is very very catchy. Don't be surprised to discover new favorites on every listen!Well, summer's almost halfway over and it appears less talented acts like Avril are still somehow dominating the airwaves. Do yourself a favor and check out this gem of an album."
3,Brilliant in spots,There are a couple of tracks where this album is fantastic and a couple where the band seems to have mailed it in to poppy nonsense.
1,yuck - more bed wetting music.,"More bed wetting music from guys so in touch with their feminine side that they've actually managed to sprout vaginas.Whatever happened to the dissafected youth that gave voice to The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Wire and The Gang Of Four in the land of fish and chips?At least I have The Pogues and Lemmy to tide me over until the next revolution.In the meantime feel free to sample the bland, banal, safe and impossible to care for Coldplay lite sack sniffers known as Snow Patrol."
1,It should be lower than 1 star,This song is junk. They say things that don't have anything to do with the song and they really must like abercrombie and fitch.
1,"Don't Shoot The Messenger, Burn The Message","To the music fan from Earth: No one needs your scholarly advice about what A&F is. Although you amy see yourself as an Oracle, dispensing at will your immeasurable knowledge, the humble folks of the internet really don't need your help. It's not like some 61 year old man is going to stumble upon this LFO site and wonder, "" What's Abercrombie and Fitch?"" Anyway, LFO are deelightful. They put the groove in my heart. And when I am in times of trouble, LFO come to me, speaking words of wisdom, Let It Be. I wanna be your LFO! She takes, just like a woman, She makes love just like a woman, She aches, just like a woman, but she breaks like an LFO!"
1,Richie Rich,"To take a line from David Spade: "" Yeah, I liked LFO the 1st time...when they were New Kids On The Block."""
1,STUPID!!!!,"I like abercrombie and fitch, but, what kind of dork sings about it in a song? Maybe they are compulsive shoppers?? There is no shame in therapy. Therapy is what I need after hearing this stupid song!"
2,"Wow, I really don't know what to say.","This song is really weird. If these guys have any talent, they definitely didn't show it in this song (I can proudly say that I've never heard any of their other stuff before). If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that my little sister wrote the lyrics. The lead ""singer"" tries to sound hard as he dishes out some of the weakest rhymes since Vanilla Ice. However, as bad as the quality of the song is, it does have some entertainment value. The chorus is catchy and I'm sure it will be a party favorite this summer (and this summer only). So borrow this cd from a friend and play it when you're feeling silly."
1,piece of sh*t,"these white boys are givin lyricists a bad name.only little white girls but this crap cuz smarter consumers can see past the ""fundip, cheery coke and a&f"".btw, i like chinese food....wait...i'm asian... f-u LFO!!"
4,What's with you people?,"I heard this song for the first time on The Disney Channel and I thought it was pretty cool. Then I come here looking to see what other people may have thought about the song and so many people seem to hate it. Two words that described what I noticed about the people that don't care for it so much- Retro and Flashback. Some people who don't like this particular song list The Beatles songs as better music. Yo, don't try to rate Gen-X or Gen-Y music if you're so RETRO! I'm sure some people back in your day thought The Beatles stunk major too! And there's nothing wrong with the Backstreet Boys either."
1,LFO = poseurs,"LFO is one of those ""bands"" that comes along to take the spoils of what has already been accomplished. They are take-offs of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync but they have even less talent. I can't believe that anyone would want to buy this album and knowingly subject themself to the hand of social control--Abercrombie and Fitch."
1,The worst song of '99,"Summer Girls by LFO is so stupid it shouldn't even be considered a song. It sounds like a bunch of people yakkin about New Kids on the Block, Chinese food, and Abercrombie and Fitch. LFO and Summer Girls takes the prize for worst band and worst song of the summer."
1,Quite Possibly the worst song to ever get any attention.,"Has anyone bothered to examine the lyrics to this song? They are complete nonsense. Chinese Food... Abercrombie and Fitch (which thy use as a rhyme TWICE in 2 different parts). If you seriously plan to buy this song, please do us all a favor and listen to it with the volume completely down."
1,The Lasting Theory,"To all LFO fans: I would like you, right now, to take a piece of paper and a pen, and write down LFO at the top of the paper. Then, in a short paragraph, sum up why you like the band and what is so intriguing about their music. Write down Summer Girls at the bottom. Now put the paper in a safe place. The reason I asked you to do this is so in 6 months, when you stumble on the piece of paper, you'll have the faintest idea who they are. Face it: in 6 weeks you'll be tired of LFO, and you'll move on to the next boring musical group. Have a nice life, and remember the paper."
1,This song is so bad Limp Bizkit should sing it.,"This is easily the worst song I've ever heard. Half the lines give you the plot of the song (this guy sometimes meets girls in the summer and sometimes he likes them) the rest is just bad rhyming.. i mean TERRIBLE. For example, ""... my name is rich. I like girls who wear Abercrombie and Fitch."" It's not like it's hard to rhyme things into the plot (or lack thereof). And then they mention Cherry Pez. I can't stand for that."
3,It's Good,"To understand this song, you really have to listen. The first time I heard the song, it was on Z-100 (accually it was the song that woke me up). I really was not listening, and I did not get the song at all. I find it a little confusing. I was not sure if it was written by a New Kid on the Block. Or a joke, or something else. But, it's a good song."
3,a cool song,"i like this song, but i don't rate is as one of my favorites. i usually listen to rap and other stuff, but this caught my attention when i was changing the stations on my radio. i think this song is going to get played out fast, just like rikki martian. but anyways, i like this song for now, and i think you should give it a listen. oh, and another thing i that i like, i like the band, they are sooo cute!!"
1,wish I had an A&F shirt!,what a stupid song for a stupid culture! is this music? I cannot believe it is selling! another hit for the next frat party! yippeee
4,It's happy! It's summer!,"I think this song is happy. Sure, the words don't have much meaning, but it's supossed to be a free-spirated summer song. Plus the guys in the video are hot, so that's a bonus. It has a cute, peaceful ballad, and the video is really cool!"
1,What the heck are these dimwits singing about?,"The song has no theme, the lyrics are 1st grade level, these guys have no talent! Did Abercrombie sponsor these guys or something? yeesh! these guys are worse than backstreet boys!"
1,This Is Terrible,"This is the worst song I have ever heard. The lyrics are terrible. What is ""Chinese Food Makes Me Sick"" got to do with the song. And ""I like girls who where Abercrombie and Fitch"". What's that. The song has a bad beat and its just plain bad."
1,The worst,"This could possibly be one of the worst songs I have ever heard. When I hear it come on the radio, I switch the station automatically. I still don't understand how this has made it into the top ten! The group has no talent and will be lucky to have a career after this!"
1,THEY SUCK!!!,"No, I did not buy the single. No, I do not EVER plan to. LFO are the most pathetic group out there!! I don't think they even deserve to be called a ""group!""The song makes no sense at all... Chinese food? NKOTB? Footloose? *rolls eyes* Yeah... that just screams ""summer fling!""For the record, these guys couldn't carry a tune if their lives depended on it!"
1,red-bag garbage,"This release is symptomatic of the widespread brain-death of American youth. It's aural sewage, and it makes me sick to think someone is getting rich off it."
4,A very hot summer song!!!,"A lot of people stated that this group has no talent...they're right in a way, it really shouldn't be called a song... but i think the way they rapped through it was original, and the lyrics are cute. The way this song ended summer was cool plus I do think we'll be hearing another hit from them soon."
4,This song grows on you!,"This song is very good! The first time I heard it I didn't get what the song was about. Now, I think it has a great beat, and is perfect for jamming a party! This song definately grows on you! It is on my #1 list."
1,Song Of The Summer? You're kidding right?,"Well,well,well...I listened to it and it sounds like third rate New Kids on the Block...I wonder if A&F paid them to drop a line about them in the song.Don't buy the single or CD...I'll give you ten reasons why: 1.The Flaming Lips-The Soft Bullitien 2.The London Suede-Head Music 3.the upcoming new CD from Boss Hog 4.Cibo Matto-Stereo Type A 5. Manic Street Preachers-This Is My Truth....6. Built To Spill-Keep It Like A Secret 7.Tricky-Juxtapose 8. Superchunk-Come Pick Me Up 9. The Best Of Aztec Camera 10.Soul Coughing-El OsoCheck out any of those ten CDs for better music and less than cliched lyrics. and hope and pray that Boy Bands like LFO will be quickly forgotten."
5,LFO-Summer Girls is the best song of the summer,LFO did a great job making this song. I love it. I plan on telling my friends about this great hit. Also I love Abercrombie & Fitch. For those of you who don't know but Abercrombie & Fitch is a clothing store geared towards teens and young adults. It is the best.
1,Whatever,"Okay, so let me tell you a little story..... One day my friend and I were in the car when all of the sudden LFO's ""Summer Girls"" came on. I looked over at my friend and said,""Why is an Abercrombie and Fitch commercial talking about chinese food?"" I cannot believe that any of these people writing these reviews actually think this song makes sense. I'm not going to sit here and say that these 3 guys can't sing because I've never heard them sing. In thier song it sounds like they're talking or rapping or something!? This is just my opinion so if you happen to think this is a good song maybe you're deaf or something. Jess"
5,I think it is the best CD ever.,I think LFO summer girls is the best cd in the world. I also wear abercrombie and fitch clothes.
1,Ab(ercrombie) Fab?,"I happen to shop at Abercrombie. Usually they play good music in the store. However, if they played this, I would have to go to Structure instead. The lyrics are like tack hammers, striking you in the head with their own miserable stupidity. Any summer girls who buy this record have obviously been affected by the sun. Miles Davis lives on forever!!!!"
5,I like girls that were abercrombie and fitch,i like girls that were abercrombie and fotch and ill take them all if i hade one wish
1,"This song is DUMB , Plain and simple!!!","I can't believe they let these guys try to rhyme a brand of clothing with one of their names, oh how clever, this really shows me the depths of your emotions doesn't it? Idiots! Chinese food makes you sick ? How about listening to your song? That makes ME sick! Now what did they rhyme with that? What a bunch of idiots. Dang monkeys..."
2,This song has nothing but a catchy tune.,"This song is catchy and thats about it. If you actually listen to the lyrics, they are incredibly stupid. They make make no sense. He jumps from one subject to the next with no reason to do that. The only reason about the stupid CD was because people would say when they looked at it. Cool, Abercrombie and Fitch and i wanted to get as many CDs as I can, I'm near 200."
2,Not exactly Hal Foster,"I first heard about this book by accident but was very anxious to read it right from the first. Being a fan of Foster's literary masterpiece in comic strip form, I found that this book left much to be desired. It diverges greatly from Foster's storyline and ignores or completely changes the most basic features about the young Price Valiant's life. Enjoyable if you like Prince Valiant, but if you LOVE Prince Valiant, stick with Foster's and John Cullen Murphy's version in the Sunday papers."
4,Great for anyone new to Prince Valiant,"This book is great for anyone who isnt familiar with Prince Valiant, and also for anyone who wants to know about his character without having to wait until sunday and attempt to understand the comics about him. I recommend it for anyone who doesnt understand the usual King Arthur wording such as ""Avallach"" which is actually pronounced as Ava-hock. Weird. Just read the book"
4,"Depends, do you like beats or music?","In trance, two styles for music that I hear areHarmonic - A beat with some classical influence (more melody)House - mostly beats with a bit of melody in the backgroundSlinky Tech-nique falls mostly into the later category. The CD consists of various styles of beats, whereas the original Slinky (I could be wrong on this one, the original Slinky I am talking about is the 2 CD set with the purple case) had more of an original melody feel to it.Bottom line: If you're into beats than melody, try this CD, as this CD is very good for it. If not, stick to the original."
4,sa-weet!,"Great to be reunited with this album after someone stole my original several years back! CD1 is definitely my fav - some uplifting and roaring tracks there for sure! Love the first track, but am ambivalent about the 2nd ""Somebody answer the phone"" which mighta been cool 10 years ago when cell phones started becoming more popular, but now just sounds kinda annoying... From there it gets better again though, with my absolute fav coming in at #9 - ""I'm in Love"". Best played loud :)"
2,Customer Perspective Only,"Don't get me wrong...this is a well written, insightful book.It is however a roadmap for a prospective outsourcing customerrather than a design guide for those of us in the hosting industry.Inversely, it teaches our industry what not to do, but as an industry engineer, I was hoping to find a best technical practices and design guide rather than a product qualification matrix with a lot of text around it."
2,Dispenser is total crap,"Avoid this product. The blades are fine, but the dispenser is total garbage. Considering what's being dispensed, it is simply dangerous getting the blades out. There's supposed to be pressure from the bottom so you can simply slide a blade out the top, but there isn't. When you push from below the blades move around and it's very cumbersome to get one out.I'll take the loss but I will never buy this product (or any Irwin product) again."
3,Irwin Bi-Metal Blades,Purchased these after reading other reviews that gave these blades good feedback. The only difference between these and other blades is they cost twice as much. Would not recommend.
1,Can't Get Them Out of Package,The little blue plastic box is cute but I was unable to get the blades out of the box. The merchandiser's dream -- you buy and throw away.
5,For my Gerber EAB. Love the blades.,"Love these blades. They go great with my Gerber EAB, which is now my primary pocket Knife. I need five more words."
5,No problems,Arrived on time and was the perfect fit for my Gerber knife. The blades stay sharp with a good amount of use for about 3-4 weeks. If you need replacement blades these are just great.
4,Nice and sharp,"These blades are nice and sharp and comes in a container for easy storage. I use these in my Gerber EAB and it works well.Not sure if it's the warehouse storage, the box didn't come in the best shape and the top blade had some rust on it. Not too big of a deal, looks like it's just the top blade. Also, it can be hard to get the blades out of the container like others have said."
4,Sharp,"These blades are sharp, it glided through plastic wrap that you would get from most products like nothing. It was so smooth as i cut through the plastic, that most my newly sharpened heavy duty scissors were struggling. The dispenser was bent and uneven, had it apply quite a bit of force to get the blades to the top, then it was a real hassle to get one blade out, as there is a small layer of oil on each blade from the process, which made it stick together, and all that harder to get it out. Had to dig my nail in between and yank one out."
3,Irwin utility Blade,"i like this blade because it does stay very sharp, only thing it rusts very fast so i gave it 3 stars"
2,Really difficult to remove blades.,"nearly impossible to get the blades out. the blades are decent, they maintain a sharp point and edge for around 3-5 uses on general materials. if you're just opening packages expect it to last a very long time, but if slicing into plastics or other harder materials it's going to give you 2-3 solid runs before you need to replace it. i can't complain enough about how difficult it is to get the blades out, i have yet to find a trick to get them out with ease."
5,Downright sensible and spiritually true,"This little book is brilliant. I suffer from severe depression and although I am also content in Christ and am joy-ful, there are times when all I can do is groan and BE a prayer. And yes, of course you can be suffering depression as an illness and be full of joy!This book starts with several chapters which are amongst the most sensible I have some across to do with depression. The chapters dealing with the use of the Psalms are very practical.Psalm 13 was called by a friend of mine, 'The Depressives' Psalm.' Using this psalm in the book was of great comfort to me, for this friend misunderstands me and has turned away from me causing enormous grief.This grief has impacted on my depression greatly. Yet, as this book testifies, there is always hope in Christ, even in the deepest despair.I know there will be total reconciliation one day.Thomas Lewis fully understands depression, first hand."
3,Hard to Follow,"This book had a good plot, but it was extremely hard to follow. There were too many characters that were not fully developed. The story kept jumping around from city to city and character to character which was very confusing. Ikept having to go back a few chapters to pick up on the character and storyline that was being presented."
2,Not professional grade,This product did nothing for my skin. I used a 10% from a different brand and it worked. This is not a professional grade peel
2,haven't seen results,"i've tried this 4 times now, and i haven't seen any results. it burns at first and there is some redness for a while, but still...same old blackheads."
1,Product not complete,"This product is being sold without the necessary extension cord, so one cannot use it immediately upon receipt. It only uses a proprietory extension cord which is not offered with the product. I had to contact the makers to find out. Both the makers and retailers would do good to inform the customers ahead of time that they need and should purchase the extension cord together with the camera. I was unable to operate the camera, so I cannot comment on its performance."
1,One Star for Sellers and Studios,"Give it up with the 100.00 prices for movies like this. And to the studios of Hollywood who refuse access to good old films, go pound sand all of you."
4,Still worth reading after all these years...,"Shortly after I was diagnosed with CFS and FM by Jay Goldstein, MD, I attended a ""CFS and the Brain"" conference at which Byron Hyde and several other researchers who appear in this book's pages spoke and shared their research and questions. Nearly a decade later, much of the information in this book is still germane - and interesting, such as the historical recounting of epidemics through the years, brain imaging patterns, neurocognitive abnormalities and more.If you aren't interested in this book for yourself, consider buying this book and donating it to your local public library or CFS/FM/MCS/ME or neuroimmune/autoimmune diseases support group so it can be read and learned from by those who are unable to afford it for themselves."
2,"Book is pretty good, the practice tests SUCK!","The book may be very well written, but I am VERY disappointed with your test software! On the very first test that I took (Developing a Logical Data Model), there were SEVERAL errors:Several questions marked the correct answer as wrong, but then in the Answer section, showed the correct answer.There were questions that tell you to choose multiple answers, but then give you radio buttons which only allow 1 answer.Several questions tell you to refer to the figure, where there is no button to get TO the figure.There is no way to close a figure once you have opened it other than moving to previous or next question and then moving back.All-in-all a very poor excuse for programming!"
2,Oblivion and Perdition,"I purchased this book with the expectation that it would help me prepare for the exam. The CD provides practice exams and other resources to give one the impression they are on their way to certification. However, there are numerous errors in the book as well as on the CD, particularly with the ""Edge Test"" software, which incorrectly grades tests and does not allow users to select the right answers. This issue is actually moot, since the practice tests actually do not address problems presented in the certification exam. I recommend using the on-line resources affiliated with the testing organizations. They also provide discounted vouchers."
4,Not only a good certification guide but a good reference...,"I used this book and transcenders to pass 70-229 on my first try. The book is excellent, however, the exam questions that came with the book won't prepare you for the exam. This book is also a good reference for your daily workings with SQL Server."
1,You are on your own,"If you have a problem with an Averatec, you are on your own. My 6 month old machine was shipped with the wrong operating system (Averatec blamed Amazon), the keyboard was defective, and when I called for warranty service, I was treated like a felon by Averatec ""customer service"". The repair, which should have been free, is going to cost $250. You get what you pay for."
1,"Cheap price, cheap hardware","My first Averatec had a defect in the power system, such that the battery could not charge. I spent $20 shipping it back for a replacement, and a month later got a replacement.The replacement has a dead pixel, the case smudges easily, the card reader is defective and after 1 year of use, the casing around the screen is cracked, the sound does not work at less than half volume, and the hard drive is dead. Note that the hard drive died just after the warranty expired, as is typical with companies using very cheap hardware.The laptop also runs very hot, the fans are loud, battery life is about 1.5 hours, and the wireless is sketchy. My next laptop will not be an Averatec.If you do buy an Averatec, expect to use it for about a year, with hardware problems now and then. After your warranty expires, the laptop will fall apart."
2,Not Worth The Money,I hoped for a lot more from this laptop. It looks decent on paper but it's a very poor performing machine. It is so fragile I am afraid to pick it up. It performs all the basics like surfing and basic apps but can't run too many processes at the same time. The video and audio quality are poor. It came with no recovery disks or instructions. I can't get a decent wireless signal no matter how close I get. The plastic case scratches easily. Maybe for $500 I would give it 3 stars. I am returning it before the 2 week trial period expires.
2,I'm predisposed not to like this one - I don't like branded merchandise,"But all the same, even if I disregard that, I still find the text boring and not very funny. *shrugs*"
5,Nothing Like It On The Market,"If you are a writer, or an aspiring one, you NEED this book. 90+% of publishers don't take unagented material. This book will help you to find an agent, and help you to get that manuscript you've worked so hard on published."
4,Nice Resource,"It was a resourceful tool, however there were headings missing such as contact info for some of the listed agents. I would have also liked to see Africa American as part of the Specialties Index since I found an agent specializing in this category. Nevertheless, I liked it and would recommend it to a friend. (Good luck in your search!)"
4,A solid resource but not the best guide to agents,"As a literary agent [URL], I want writers to have lots of information so they can focus their queries to the agents that are most likely to be a match for them. This guide is a useful tool to help writers hone their search for the right representative.Another great guide to consider, though, is Jeff Herman's ""Writer's Guide to Book Editors, Publishers, and Literary Agents,"" which features in-depth interviews with many agents and thus gives a fuller picture of their interests and working style."
5,Tremendous reference and cross reference guide,"If you need an agent, this is a great place to start. The book cross references agnets which are looking for new clients, established writers etc. They'll tell you each agents specialty, (fiction, non-fiction and types of each) their names, address, and how you can querie them. Every agent listed does not charge for reading etc., thus eliminating possible scam artists. A tremendous tool....the rest is up to the author."
2,problems connecting with computer,"I too saw that my kingston had problems connecting to my pc and mac. It's pretty much 50/50, on whether the computer will detect it or not. I have to then take it out and plug it back in and then usually it will work. Recently, it died on me, and because It was only about a year old, I figured I probably had a bad item. Whether or not it was shotty workmanship or I just got unlucky, I don't know."
1,Worked well for two months and then completely failed,"I purchased this USB drive due to the low cost and due to the Kingston name. I used the drive to transfer data between computers and did so about once a day. The drive worked well at first, but after only two months of use, the USB drive stopped working. Fortunately, I had not deleted the data after I transferred it to a drive so nothing was lost, but losing data was certainly a risk.I would hesitate to purchase another Kingston drive because my experience is that they are unreliable. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. I plan to spend more money on another brand in the future because it is worth the extra expense to ensure that my data is safe."
2,Secure Traveler a Disappointment,"I was thinking this review did not really apply to the product. But yes, I think it does. Very simply, I put a file in the Privacy Zone containing my passwords. One day, as I was on the internet and had the drive in its USB port, a virus tried to attack the file in the secure portion. (Because the virus did not touch any files outside the Privacy Zone makes me think that it was purposefully going after secure areas.)I don't think the virus every reached the file in the Privacy Zone. Yippee!!! But after the attack, I could not reach my secured file either. And I could not use the Privacy Zone anymore. In the end, I did not have my passwords anymore.KIngston had done it's job. I would have hoped that they could have defrayed the virus AND allowed me access to the secure area afterwards."
2,Stopped working,I choose this flash drive because it offered Password Protection. I hardly use it. I think I used it 15 times in the last year and now it won't work at all. What a waste!Contacted Kingston who had nothing to offer.Make sure you have a copy of everything you have on your flash drive because you never know when it will just stop working. I knew it would eventually quit but so soon??
4,Better than the others I've been using,"Have used PNY, Lexar and Iomega flash drives. Bought this Kingston based on reviews here of the Kingston Data Traveler and the Data Traveler II.I like this drive; does everything it's supposed to, doesn't come with annoying software, and has a snug-fitting cap. You'd appreciate the last feature, especially if you bought a 1GB PNY. Its cap is particularly loose fitting.Used to be, with XP SP1, these flash drives needed to be formatted with NTFS file system and also (in Device Manager) needed its Policies set to ""Optimize for Performance"", or they would run badly.Quite to my surprise this doesn't really seem to matter with XP SP2, which I now use. I formatted it NTFS anyway but leave its Policies set to Optimize for Quick Removal (the default) and don't seem to be paying a penalty.Would recommend this DT II over the plain Kingston Data Traveler. It's worth the extra $4 or so for its speed.Will be buying additional Kingston IIs as the need arises."
4,"Some startup problems, then works fine","I had some odd problems with this flash drive ont he first day that I used it. It didn't seem to reliably connect to my computers. Once when it did connect copying files was amazingly slow. After those first few bad experiences, it has worked fine ever since. Maybe the contacts needed to be worn down a little bit or something. Anyway, since then I have used the DataTraveler regularly (just about every day) to copy files between an HP laptop and two iMacs and it has worked without a hitch. One funny observation. They put an In Use light on one side of this drive. In about half the USB ports I have put it in, the light is facing away from the user. It would be nice if there were some universal standards for USB ports about which way is up, or in the case of vertically mounted ones, which way is facing the user. It would make them easier to plug in without looking inside the plug every time (for those of us who use multiple machines)."
5,I wish everything were made like a Kingston drive,"I just washed and dried my Kingston stick drive- twenty minutes in warm cycle (forgotten in a pocket), then about forty minutes in the dryer, banging around on the walls. And...it works perfectly. The only difference is that the exterior is slightly cleaner. I'm a fan for life."
5,Great Buy,"This is not only cheap, but it holds a lot of stuff! I can't believe how fast I can transfer data on and off of this flash drive. But, what do you expect, it's a Kingston."
5,I LOVE my Kingston Data Traveler II!,"I am real happy I bought this. It works great just like promised. I have been carrying this around on my key ring for a long time now and it is working great. The cap is nice and tight, so I don't have to worry about it getting lost. I'm real rough with my keys sometimes, but the Kingston doesn't give me any troubles. Very reliable, nice looking, sturdy, great price, ... etc."
4,Excellent drive,"This is a good usb drive, the only flaw is that the keyring comes out of one side instead of the middle. If it were in the middle it'd hang from my keys nicer."
5,It works,"Ive been using the product for a couple weeks now, and its good. I move lots info back and forth and it works great and is very well built. Unlike a lot of other key drives that fall apart, this one feels more sturdy than the others."
4,very good at price ..,very good over all.. no problem so far.... works well....... blue light is nice .!only 1 problem... i couldn't fit it in keychain... :-(..
2,Won't last!,"I bought this product after my hip surgery it worked well while it last but it didn't hold up. It broke in stages first the shoe horn then the hooks. It's made of hard plastic and the shoe horn part snaped when I used it to put on my shoes after just a few uses; a week or so later I used it to remove my pants with just a gentle push the hook broke. I could have been injured when it broke due to the hard plastic and it's cutting ability since it broke during use and scratched my leg. Stay away from this product, find something sturdy, this isn't it!"
1,The Secret Life of Bees,"This is the most poorly written novel I have read. The story is interesting; the author's inability to handle suspense and sensitive incidents with skill made it a labor to read. She is too clever by half, she uses far too many supporting expressions for some incidents, thereby robbing them of exquisite pulse. Her narrative syntax is deplorable. I am unable to agree with the critical raves. She is amateurish in even trying to express a fourteen-year-old's views. The emotional content is treated with blast furnace force."
4,A good follow up to Special Lady's success,"Ray, Goodman and Brown made a good comeback in 1986, 7 years after that megahit Special Lady in '79. Special succeeded strongly as a ballad during a disco dance heavy music period. Maybe they took their time in that 7 year hiatus to make some solid songs. I like Take it To the Limit and the ballads that dominate this collection. Though I haven't heard anything from them since then, this was another good comeback for the group."
5,Unexpected music found by accident,"Walking through the Roman Catholic Church of Galway, I heard some music through the speakers. Asking what kind of music that was, one gave me Liam Lawton's Ancient Ways Future Days.I owe a lot of Christian music (old & new) but this cd is my most beloved cd. The combination of music, voice and words are so intens that it will not let you go. It was the finest cd I bought in ireland on holiday and I still bless the day that in the course of my walk through Galway, I came across that church.By the way, I'm a protestant Dutchman."
3,Rubin's Approach to Art Therapy: Theory and Technique is a g,"Rubin touches on many points which would be necessity for art therapists to learn. However, this book is so full of terms specific to art therapy that readers need prior understanding of many terms for the book to make much sense. This is a book well worth the time to read just not by the beginner student of art therapy."
3,It's a toss-up.,"The watch itself is very pretty and seems to be fairly solid, but the chain is absolutely worthless. It became discolored after being worn twice; most of the gold tone simply disappeared! The watch is still fine, though, so I suppose it's worth buying a new chain for. Even so, a person shouldn't have to."
1,I was disappointed,"I waited a couple of weeks before wearing the watch. It looked reallypretty, but it did not work. I took it to a jeweler figuring that maybe it was the battery. I was told that the battery was good. The battery connections were good. I was also told that the watch was no good. It isa beautiful watch."
4,Thought provoking!,"This book is a little difficult to read but it does keep your interest just to see what he comes up with next. The theories are somewhat far fetched, especially in relation to the Bible (and I'm an Atheist who has read and studies the entire old and new testaments). But the important thing is that it gets you thinking, especially about the society were currently living in and where its roots may have come from."
5,Sometimes things are not always what they seem.,"The book is very dense in information. I've now read it three times and I think that the author is truly inspired. It is amazing how many ideas in one small book could expose the foundations of society, government and religion as fraudulent. The tome shreds reality as most people in the western world believe it to be. I look at things differently now and the world would be a much different place if everybody were to read this book. This book just might change your perceptions of the world in a positive way, it did mine. Certainly an underground classic."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Hilarious story with great art and the hook finding fine of Jeff Hook himself. Super kangaroo as in the superman sense. Don't try hunting them. :)With Jeff Hook doing the illustrations, each page also turns into a game for kids, as they race to find where the hook is hidden in each picture, adding to the enjoyment."
5,Just what I was looking for!!!,"These candles look nice, come on automatically, get good battery life, great price, and they look great in my window. This is our second year to use them."
3,Base needs to be taller,I had high hopes for this light. It looks fine out of the package but the base where the light sensor is located is blocked by the window sash as it is placed on the window sill. I would think this is the case with all window so that the light is on all the time as it reads dark with the sash at the sill blocking the light. We rectified this with a wood block placed under the base to prop it up so the sensor is facing the day light thus allow the sensor to work properly. I am surprise no one mentioned this obvious problem. Apart from that the flicker is ok since I don't see it as our shades covers this at night anyways but it is a bit distracting. The light level could also be a bit brighter and whiter. It lasted more than the 20 days with battery. We don't know how much longer since we removed the candles before the battery died.
5,Better than I first thought,"I was initially concerned about yellow light. After I placed them in all 28 windows - they looked GREAT from outside and realistic with the flickering light. I had candle tapers burning on my dining room table and noticed that the lights in the windows were exactly the same coloring as the real candle flame. So, they may not be white lights - but I like these better."
1,Battery operated candles,I purchased 12 of these and I regret ever buying them. They are great when looking at them inside your house but as I drove by my house I could not see the lights on these candles. I am very disappointed and would not purchase them again.
4,"No fuss all season, but pretty dim lighting","I didn't have to touch these all season...hope you have some batteries around, pop them in, set the light and forget it. That was nice. However, I will say that these are a little smaller than my other candles and the light that they emit is really a very low glow...I'd say they have a bigger ""flame"" than a real candle does, but they're not as bright. With that said, I will use them again next year and will definitely look to buy more to replace my older corded ones."
1,buried in the bushes and not what I wanted,"very disappointed with my purchase. the light is amber, not white, as pictured, and it flickers, which was not in the description. The Fed Ex delivery person put the package behind a shrub, where I didn't find it for more than a week. The only positive aspect of the experience is the seller responded promptly to my emails. And, it was his suggestion that I look all around the front door that enabled me to locate the hidden package.Sadly, in all, it was a very disappointing experience.I will be paying to return the candles.Heather"
3,Good Quality for the price,"Compare these to the Plow and Hearth lights and you can save a few dollars per light. I did not realize they flickered. and at first was disappointed about that, however, the flicker is quite realistic and pleasant. The light is not overly bright, and the battery lasts about a month as stated. I just replaced the batteries and they shine much brighter. The sensor is pretty sensitive and in a darker room the lights seem to be on all day. Overall a good buy."
2,Halloween or Christmas?,"I agree with the reviewer who said these are better for Halloween. We have a townhouse on a block with others who have window candles and these just look comical -- too short, too dim. We bought 8 of them -- one for each window -- and crack up laughing when we come home to our Christmastime ""haunted house"" at night. I'm now trying to figure out if I can change the bulbs..."
4,Very good for battery-operated LED,"I think these are pretty good for a battery-operated LED. I am trying to replace some old hard-wired Christmas window candles which have a lovely ""glow"" but having to plug them in doesn't work in our new house. Of course battery-operated incandescents still give off the prettiest light, however they only last a night or two on a set of batteries! Of the LED candles I've tried, these are the best so far. The color is a little orange-y, but not the totally unrealistic blue-ish or flourescent white which I've seen in other products. Also the ""flickering"" is pretty good, not perfect, but close to my nice ""flameless"" candles and much better than the ""flashing"" I've seen in other candles. Also they are bright enough to be easily seen from the street. I wish they had a setting for just ""on"" and not ""flicker"", but they are a good option for a good price - I'll keep them."
5,Love these lights,"The sensor works very well, on at dusk off at dawn. One set of batteries last all through the Christmas season."
3,Not very bright,"These are great in theory, and they are great if you are going for a ""real candle"" look, but if you want something that is nice and bright to put on your window sill, this is not the candle for you."
3,Orange colored light,"Orange colored light, battery doesn't last long. Light sensor sensitivity is varied between candles. Some more sensitive than others so battery life varies as well."
4,Pretty Good Except for One Weird Thing ...,"I purchased two of these units for use in our front windows. I think the light (both level and flickering effect) are fine. However, I did notice a weird thing ... when the lights turn on at dusk, sometimes only the middle candle lights and sometimes they don't flicker, even though the switch is set to ""flicker"" position. I have to reset the switch on the back of the unit (turn off, then back on) to get all three to come on with the proper effect. Since this is happening with both units and the batteries are brand new, I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a minor annoyance since it'd be nice not to have to touch them after they go into the window for the holidays. But I'm still happy with the purchase (just not five-star happy)."
1,Good tidings LED Christmas Candles..bad tidings!,Poor performance product. One of four window candles worked only for two days! Light sensors are a problem with these products. This was the second set I had ordered. Never again!
5,These are great!,"These are battery operated, so no wires to plug in. And they have a light sensor, so they come on as it gets dark without needing to be switched on. A friend told me about these, and I've been very happy with the ones I ordered."
5,Price gouging is not okay.,"One of the most amazing, heartfelt bands I have heard in a long time. If you like honesty in your music, D'Oh is right up your alley.The No Idea Records website has all of their work at great prices. Hint hint."
5,Sherpa Pet Carrier,One of the best or maybe the best pet carriers made for small pets such as cats and small dogs. They come in different sizes.
3,Nice but...,Nice carrier but I wish that my puppy could look out better. He cries when I put him inside. I think if he could see us better he would be more comfortable.
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have 3 small dogs, one at 7 lbs, one at 5 lbs, and one at 3 1/2 lbs. I like to take all three of them places, and I wanted a travel bag that was big enough to comfortably hold all three dogs. I also wanted a bag that had a sturdy bottom to support their combined weight. I also wanted a bag that would keep its shape and not collapse on the dogs while they were in it. I wanted a bag that had flaps that could either cover the mesh windows or roll up and provide additional ventilation. When I found this bag I found a travel bag with all of these features plus a few I didn't even know I wanted. I like that I can use either a side or top openings to get the girls in and out of the bag. I really like the ample storage pockets. I can fit anything I need to take along for them in there. I love this travel bag!"
5,Sherpa Ultimate,"I highly recommend this carrier. The side flaps that roll up and down are perfect for times when the vet office is full of dogs (I use this for my 3 cats). It is very sturdy and holds it's shape well, and is really easy to carry over my shoulder."
1,NOT the Richard Upjohn Book,"Someone really screwed up. All of the inside pages for this book are for the book ""Richard The Third"", by a completely different author, NOT ""Richard Upjohn - Architect And Churchman"" by Everard M. Upjohn."
1,NOT FIFTH EDITION,"As I understand it, this is not the Fifth Edition Warhammer 40k rulebook. Buyers be careful, as the product information says this is Second Edition. Make sure you are getting what you want, not what you think is being sold."
3,Not the best,"His cartoon history of the world/modern world set was amazing. bloody good read. This one however fall short. It's still quite good and one of a kind, but not as good and less ""cartoon-y"" more like a illustrated book than a cartoon book."
4,Find out how kooky Amerika's foundations are!,"The bias is a nice and refreshing splash of cold water in the shorts. It's nice to know that all history texts on the U.S. aren't foolishly portrayed with savage natives, good Christians, wonderful Manifest Destiny's, mass consumption and the overall goodness of corporations for mankind. It is nice to see links between events that have occured throughout history. Everything that has happened has been decided upon by white wealthy greedy bastards right from the start. A pleasant reminder of how the tobacco industry has been the prodigy of the corporate welfare system. Most things have happened to please an individual or a small group of associates -- this light has been turned off in other historical texts. (I also recommend ""Do It!"" by Jerry Rubin.) Question Authority! Thank you Larry."
2,tendentious,"While I loved Gonick with his History of the Universe series, this one was a real letdown. The book comes from a left wing prospecitve, and uses the Peoples History of the United States as a source multiple times. Galbraith is sourced multiple times as well, and he is a well known hard left economist. Aslo used as a source is WEB DeBois, who while he did some very good work, and is worth discussing, was a communist that gave up his American citizenship and moved to Guana.If you can stand your history with a strong dose of bias, the art work and style of Gonick are worth a look. If you are interested in history, find something else."
4,It's still funny...,"Gonick as usual is a riot and I don't fault him for his bias. He puts it out there the way he sees it...any other way wouldn't be as funny. This is part fact, part satire. I still highly recommend this book to adults or teens who have a solid foundation in US History and have already formed an opinion on our leaders. Even if you don't agree, it's still funny.I agree with the prior reviewer who recommended Hakim's 'History of US' for the kids. I know of two little girls (ages 8 and 9)who are reading through these in their spare time FOR FUN!"
2,Self-confessed Bias...,"Before buying this one, be aware that Mr. Gonick has very explicitly defined his political orientation in his own website. Read the forums, particularly his spicy comments about Bush and Kerry. Other cartoon guides (Statistics and Physics) were fairly immune to this sort of bias and somewhat enjoyable, but in this one, it cuts right into the meat. The topic is simply out of reach for anyone so blindly submersed (or compromised?) in either conservative or liberal order. Independent thinking, particularly for the writing (or re-writing) of history, is imperative."
1,MAKES ONE WISH THAT ZERO STARS WERE AN OPTION!,"Please don't waste your money. his movie is a glaring example of money wasted on making a movie. That being said, if you are a teenage boy or a guy who just wants to see boobs and women in skimpy outfits this might work for you. But for someone looking for a TRULY GOOD MOVIE DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very Bad,Don't waste your money. I hope this didn't cost to much to make. The acting was so pour. Bad Bad
2,defently B-raded,This was a second rate B filme not stuped enuph to be funny. But to stuped to be good. It is bad. But not as bad as rednek zombie
1,poor boring movie,It is a boring old movie. The quality of Photography and sound is bad. The story is poor and not intersting.
4,Alice in Wasteland Review,This movie is good stuff. It's worth your time and money. It's funny and it's not over-produced or campy. The actresses look good too.
1,Waste is the right word for this!,"I rented this film trying out Amazon's VOD rental features. This is a very lowbudget crime caper. The acting is terrible. The women are somewhat attractivein a trailer park sort of way. That is a good thing because most of the actiondoes take place in a dump of a trailer park. A low budget film can be good ifit has a good story, decent acting, nice action scenes or an abundance of femalenudity. It is too bad that this flick is short on all these things."
1,WORST MOVIE I've (half) seen,"I will admit I only watched HALF of this horrid movie before putting it in my ""try to get rid of ""file. I gave it the good old College try and struggled to finish watching it to the end but after two tries I had to give up before I lost all of my interest to buy another DVD. The acting was undoubtedly the worst I have ever seen outside a grammar school graduation play. I am so depressed, and I use to like watching some of these B-movies."
3,Seriously awful...but...,"This is really an pretty bad movie, but it has its clever moments. The acting hovers around C+ but occasionally bursts up to A. The dialog is horrible. Lots of action, and some really funny moments. The soundtrack is fun and quirky. It was worth a $0.99 rental, but nothing more."
3,Good flick ...,"I thought this was an entertaining film for such a low budget. The cinematography was good and, even better, the actresses are definitely worth admiring.Alice in Wasteland"
4,Cool Hip-hop Messanger Bag,"The quality is really good and the different spaces are very useful, for me the only problem was that it was quite bigger as I thought in the beginning, I was planing to use for the day to day, but I used it for travel and I truly recommend it for that purpose."
2,Not serious.,"A typical recording done in the Third World by adventurers coming from Europe with a good equipment. The work is not serious, although most of the performers are real drummers. Titles of tracks are strange inventions and lack a minimum of musicological seriousness. However, the text written by Gustavo Goldman (who did not participate neither in the recording sessions nor in the final Parisian editing) is good. The other announced texts are tricky, because they have been picked up from books written before."
3,Good but not on its own,"I bought this product for my husband. Good product. Doesn't really have a disturbing smell. You don't really see results unless you are using it with another hair loss prevention product like nizoral shampoo. The shampoo by itself showed results to stop hair loss. We added folligen and it seemed to be OK, then when he skipped a few days of folligen we really noticed how much it helped to stop the hair from coming out. We will continue to buy"
1,Disappointed,"I read online this product lengthens eyelashes and thickens brows. Not only did it not lengthen my lashes, after 4 weeks of use they looked stumpy, and shorter than when I began. No effect at all on brows. I used it on a small patch of thinning hair near my hairline and think maybe I see a tiny improvement. Will not buy again."
3,eyelash growth,"it actually did work for eyelash growth, though a bit irritating. Stopped using for a while and will try it again soon."
3,easy read,"I was very excited when I received this in the mail. however it is not a translations as I was hoping but more of an explanation of what is inside the original. was still interesting, but like most his books left me wanting more."
5,"Natural, mellifluent","So far, almost every interpretaion of Bach's well-tempered clavier involves the radical faith about music and music performance, and every one tried their best excavating the great depth hidden in this reportoire. Hence we can easily recognize every pianist's deep thought,as Gould reflected his extraordinary and shining charecter, Richter both contemplated and composed, Landowska sang, Schiff focused on acoustic sweetness, Goula insisted on clean, unpedaled line. Here Herwitt gives us a new scope, a natural structural thinking of Bach. Every prelude and fuge is kept in a very natural tempo and articulation, without strange over-emphasized theme and contertheme. The progression of Hewitt's music is mellifluent, sometimes you will find these Bach's preludes and fuges sound so sweet, even seem to be a whole new work! If you do not expect to find or receive some serious meaning of life or faith in Bach's well-tempered klaviea, then is is a very good performance indeed."
4,Lovely,"The 1st thing I look for in Cat books are 'real' pictures of cats and was a little disappointed when this offered none.Nevertheless, the information contained would please any cat lover. Ranging from cat-breed information to cat names, cats in history, cats in Hollywood and cat quotations, you would surely love this 'little' big book of cat tidbits.The text are in large print with cute illustrations. You'll never be a moment bored."
1,not usable due to SonicStage,"Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each ""artist"" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1."
1,Beware,"This is my second mp3 player; I had an inexpensive Creative that was easy to use and nicely designed but it stopped working after about six months. I figured I'd try a Sony. I should have done my homework first. This unit is flimsy, the design is awkward. You have to use Sony's Sonic Stage to transfer files and it takes forever. Not compatable with itunes. I'm not a tech person but from what I can gather, it's really for playing Atrac files, not mp3. I tried to convert my mp3 files to Atrac using Sonic Stage but this only worked 50% of the time - (maybe I was doing something wrong but I invested about 3 hours and still couldn't get half my files to play.) This is just a white elephant. Make sure you know what you're buying before you get this."
1,Not worth price,"Although this book may have been helpful in the days before the internet, it is nothing more than a printed copy of the Florida Construction Lien Laws, which are easily accessible on the internet."
4,Not as nice as the older printing,"Fr. Tetlow has provided a wonderful resource to spiritual directors. I had previously borrowed a copy of the 1991 printing of this book and had been using it for several months before I bought my own. The 1999 version still offers the same great text but the binder has changed from grey to a horrible peach color and the pages, which used to be printed on something close to cardstock are now on regular paper. This was something of a disappointment."
5,Delicious!!!,"This compilation is a smoooooth mix of very eclectic vibes. A must have for the ladies man, that likes to wine & dine his ladies. Check out track #2 on the second disc it's simply DELICIOUS."
5,GREAT product,"This recorder works excellent. Compared to one I got for my daughters Nano, THIS MP3 recorder is perfect. The sound quality is good. it is simple to use, has the added feature of being able to unplug the mic and use another input device, including line-inputs if you have the right cord to connect to your recorder from another source (like a radio headphone jack for example).Buy this unit direct from Amazon. I love mine, and I am certain you will like this unit as well. To see my comments about the MP3 Recorder for a Nano, please see my other reviews. Amazon.com has a fantastic return policy, and not all resellers have the same policy. Please read my review about the Nano MP3 Recorder to see why it is best to buy DIRECTLY from Amazon.Com.Matt"
5,Really Cool Book,"This is the latest edition of an atlas that's been out for awhile. With colorful world maps and all sorts of fascinating graphs and charts this book unlocks cultural statistics--from quality of life to where in the world U.S. troops are to who has the most satellites in space. My middle school students love this atlas and will (no kidding!) pick it up and browse through it on their own. I've bought a classroom set and it was money very well spent. If you cover geography, or anything having to do with the world in middle school or high school check out this book.Mr. Smith and publishers:We need an atlas like this one that covers just the USA."
3,It's good for what it is,"It's an atlas-that's as good as it's going to get. It's not meant to conjure any feelings within the reader, it just presents cold hard facts. You take what you want from it; it's not a narrative. You just have to look at the numbers and figures and from there make an interpretation based on what is being given to you. I think it does a good job at presenting facts and figures in an easy to read and at a glance fashion. It's good for what it is."
3,Jarry's work is the tangential point between zero and infinity...,"So far, this is the best compendium of Jarry's work I have found. It has the full text of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician which is very difficult to find. Overall, this collection exposed me further to Jarry's work, which quite frankly I find inaccessible. After reading him I understand why he is considered the father of Surrealism and, in my opinion, Surrealism's best medium is not print, but rather art and film."
4,Unique projects,"Create Your Own Cross Stitch is for people who want to start their own project and create something unique, but do not know where to begin. From the book I found out that one does not need many tools to get a project done. Everything is kept very simple. The book offers some simple, but very effective things that one came make. Finishing touches for most projects do not require much effort. Size and complexity of a project are left to the individual to decide, so everything depends on dedication. I would especially recommend this book to people who have been cross-stitching already."
4,good commentary,You can't beat the price for this commentary. Haimo is a very good commentator who drew wisely from the early commentators ahead of him. I highly recommend getting this commentary on your bookself!
4,Good Fit,Fit is good in my 2005 Ford Escape. The carpet pile could be deeper but otherwise great item looks and fits good.
5,inspired summer cooking with right amount of effort,"Worthington's book is superb, as are her independent titles (she also has published some titles for Williams-Sonoma but its editorial efforts takes away from the specialness of her own efforts). Her 3 cookbooks have become my standbys for entertaining of any kind -- and all year around. The Taste of Summer is a wonderful collection that I have been using year after year and never tire of it. And her recipes never fail to bring rave reviews from my guests. Worthington is an inspired writer and chef, and I look forward to her new release in the fall"
3,Not for non-gourmet types,"I was hoping for a summer cookbook with recipes that featured typical summer foods. This book seemed perfect for a Martha Stewart waspy type but not for someone like me who was looking for twists on the typical fare. Not only that, but the recipes called for fairly expensive fare. If you shop at Central Market and host parties for friends who do also, then this is the book for you."
2,Balls Too Big for small dog,"I called the company Vo Toys and asked if they made these balls in a 2 inch and they don't .... So, these balls couldn't be used by my mini doxie Snoopy because she can't get her mouth around it."
4,Good vacuum for the price,"A powerful vacuum for the price. Very easy to assemble and fairly lightweight. The only complaint I have is that the vacuum is extremely loud, especially if you're using it on hard wood floors. I feel a bit sorry for my neighbors that live below me! Good buy otherwise."
2,Don't waste your money.,"The songs on this album are great songs, but the sound quality is DIPLORABLE!!! What a DISAPPOINTMENT. I really like Josephine's style and voice, but you can barely make out the words on this muffled slurred CD. It's like looking at a beautiful piece of art thats blurry. I am assuming that all the records in the ""Cocktail Hour"" series are just as bad judging from the reviews I've seen. Too bad I didn't do my research before making this purchase. My advice to other customers...look for the same songs elsewhere. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Ugh !!,"Nasty quality, slurry, blurry, harsh and poorly remastered. Truly sounds like a series of well-worn 78's. If that's your thing, you'll enjoy this recording. But, if you're interested in actually being able to HEAR Josephine's remarkable voice, then there's little little reason to waste your money on this 3rd rate effort, given the broad choice of much better remasterings available."
5,awsome lure,"the lure was for a friend, but he took it out to a contest, (Muskies) and caught a fish the first couple of casts, but it was a Northern... but hey it works"
2,deck disaster,Used this for the first time this weekend. Product said nothing about bleaching. So Don't ware your favorite clothes! I put this on my five year old deck that was previously treated with Thompsons weather proofing. I was shocked when it pulled the wax out of the wood from the previous treatment five years ago and made a waxy mess all over my deck. I read the directions well and used it exactly as directed but was very unhappy. Now my deck has to be resurfaced and weather proofed. This was suppose to be a simple do it yourself job that is now going to cost me a contractor and not to mention the clothing I bleached in the beginning.
3,Pressure washing works better,"After I bought this, a friend told me to skip the cleaner & just power wash... he felt like an authority as he had just finished adding a 4th deck to their house. Since I had the product, I used two of these large bottles on our large deck, and was fairly impressed at what it removed.However, it was too difficult to use on vertical surfaces, and I used an old, weak power washer of my Dad's to work on those. What a difference! I then found that I also needed to power wash the flat boards that I had already used Deck Cleaner on... as the Deck Cleaner cleaned wood looked gray and worn out next to the pressure washed boards.I regret having spent the money on the cleaner, and am looking for a newer, better pressure washer. The money I wasted on the cleaner could have gone toward a better pressure washer."
1,Piece of junk,Spend a few more bucks and buy a real carpet cleaner. It simply doesnt work. Why? Poor engineering. Thanks hoover. Can I have my three hundred bucks back?
4,Great Mystery,"I normally don't read mystery novels. This was my first and it did not disappoint. Harlem Redux follows David McKay as he figures out why/if his sister committed suicide. All the while, David has a secret of his own that he doesn't want revealed. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, there was a twist that I was not ready for. Persia Walker definitely keeps readers on their toes with this novel, and I'm interested in reading whatever else she has written."
5,Harlem Redux is full of surprises,"Persia Walker's first effort in Historical Fiction, Harlem Redux, paints vivid images while building the mystery and intrigue that surrounds the McKay family in 1920's Harlem. Things are not as they seem to appear. This is a recurring theme throughout the entire novel. Walker demonstrates an uncanny ability to draw the reader into the tapestry of interwoven story lines. Her ending, while tying everything together, will surprise even the most experienced mystery reader. And reading the last page first, didn't help.Harlem Redux: A NovelHarlem Redux"
4,Wonderful Read,"When I first picked up this book, I wasn't sure I would like it. However, Harlem Redux is wonderful. I found it so good, in fact, that I stayed up all last night to finish it. Truly a good mystery. I hope Ms. Walker writes many more. I would love to see some of the characters appear in future books to know what happens to them."
3,Fantastic read,"Harlem Redux captivated me so, that I could not get to it fast enough. The plot was so thick yet, I learned a lot about the Harlem Renaissance. I was never so enthralled in to History, the way Walker added fact with fiction. This book is the best, that I have read in years. Excellent choice."
5,Great read!,"This book has it all--history lessons and atmosphere about a fascinating period; compelling characters with all kinds of complexes; suspense, lies, double-crosses, murder...what else could a reader possibly want? I got totally caught up in it, and was dying to find out the secrets and see the resolution. I'm just waiting for her next offering. Sister Walker is GOOD!"
4,Thorough review of VSM in the office,"Ok, don't buy this book as a general ""lean office"" book - it's not that. It's ALL about mapping a value stream, running projects based on the value stream, and using VSM as the management tool for a lean office. I like that, but I felt that this book spends far too much time focused on the one tool, and doesn't emphasize that it's one tool that is part of an overall management system that will just require more.Pros:- Excellent, thorough, breakdown of VSM in the office- Focused entirely on an office/service environment. It's not a retread with ""manufacturing"" replaced with ""service"" like some books.- Visual, with excellent pictures and examples throughoutCons:- Only emphasizes one tool- The wastes discussion was weak compared to other office books - I found several others to cover them much more thoroughly, with better examples."
2,Weaker than orginal battery,"Described as replacement for my PM 325 battery, but it's not as strong as the original battery. Guess I get what I paid for...Make sure if you want a 1000 mAH battery like the original, that it specifically says that in description, or you'll end up with a 700 mAH like this one."
2,cell battery,"purchased this battery new. 1st few charges were good. after that, subsequent charges were short lived. battery would need to be charged in less than 24 hrs from previous charge. POOR QUALITY PRODUCT."
5,Cyborg 009,"I've started watching Cyborg 009 on Cartoon Network. I missed a few episodes, so I picked up Cyborg 009 Unedited And Uncut. The box set contains information booklet about the nine cyborg characters and extras. There are 8 episodes on 2 DVDs. If you want to know the episode titles. I have included them in this review.Disc .0101.The Birth02.The Escape03.Assassin Of Flash04.At The End Of The Battle05.Tears Of Steel06.Search For The ProfessorDisc .0207.Defeat The Invisible Opponent08.Friend"
3,It's still a little kids dvds,"Even though the dvds says {unedited & uncut} don't expect to see some blood, minor profanity, or sexually humer, the only difference is just more action. When Toonami was airing ""Cyborg 009"" they could of shown it's orginal version. I'll admite their's minor brief nudity but thats not enough for parents to be worried about. Juging by the way the characters are drawn, it's makes the show looks two cartoony which means older people will never go near this TURKEY what a waste of time.The show is about people who were once humans but turn into cyborgs by some mad scientist."
2,Not really a good show,"The show ""Cyborg 009"" it should have not been on (Cartoon Networks) Toonami in the first place...how can they replace it for Rurouni Kenshin it was the best show on their, that's what you watch if you want great anime. If Toonami expect to get some ratings and build an audience, they need to quit doing some of the weird stuff. I wish this show would have started on saturday nights in the first place. I think the show looks like a childrens show I don't know why they say it is uncut like it is going to be rated 13-up.These are some other animes I advise you not to see cause of it being too boring,childish,or stupied:Kirby,Ultimate Muscle,Reign,Fooly Cooly,Piolet Canidiate,Pokemon, Hamtro,and Sonic X."
5,Excellent Guide for CSS,"Although I'm not a newbie to CSS, I had a lot to learn. And this book was the perfect teacher. Great examples and tutorials. The author gave many great usablitly and accessiblity tips -- a very convincing evangelist for design standards. Although he didn't convince me to give up completely on my WYSIWIG editor. That's too scary. ;-)"
3,Nora Roberts is my favorite author.,"Three short stories that are entertaining but not her best work. Roberts has become an even better writer since these were originally published, but they are good romances and a Nora Roberts junky like me wants to read and own all of her works."
5,tough sword and pretty,hard triangulated blade very tough can handle good stabbins and not bend or break and nice to look at
2,Disappointing,"As a long-time student of ASL (and other languages) I was looking forward to a more accessible book. I would not recommend this book to anyone without a degree in linguistics and even then I would hesitate. The authors seem to maximize the use of technical jargon and acronyms without even the slightest effort to define terms for the non-specialist. This is an opaque thesis that I mistook for a general work on the subject of ASL syntax. Other books on the linguistics of ASL are head and shoulders above this one.On top of this, the photos are abysmal. For a book that is trying to illustrate subtleties of ASL non-manual markers, etc., to have the photos be so poor is inexplicable. They look like the twentieth photocopy made with the exposure set to ""extra dark.""What a missed opportunity! Isn't there anyone out there that can present the syntax of ASL systematically and in clear English?"
2,Not so World Class Pizza Cutter,"My wife and I have had pizza night every Tuesday for years and have always tried to improve our experience from different ingredients, temperatures, stones, pizza cutters etc.My wife always wanted a great Pizza cutter and I had been on the prowl, reading reviews and finally came upon this one here at Amazon. WE finally got it last Monday and tried it out Tuesday night. The size and price seemed right, just too flimsy. I'm going to have to buckle down and spend the extra money on the other alternative I saw here at Amazon today so I can have it for next week.Mangia!"
