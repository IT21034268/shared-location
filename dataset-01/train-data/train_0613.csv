3,works fine but forget the battery pack!,"My daughter is very happy with this little machine, but don't bother trying to use the battery pack. She charged it for 24 hours and on the first attempt to use it in the car, it gave out in less than 15 minutes. The car charger works fine as does the ac connection."
4,Adequate for the price,"The first one I got was defective. Amazon's customer service really helped me out in replacing it. This product is cheap, in both senses of the word, but that is what I was expecting and what I got. I am satisfied with the product."
2,Plays only about half of my kid's dvds,The picture's good--when the dvd will play. I have found that about half of my daughter's dvds won't play in the player. Some will play at times and not at others. (These dvds are commercially-made dvds and are in good condition.)
1,unreliable,"Worked pefectly for a few months and then just quit. Great for the price but I would look into some kind of replacement warranty if possible. I loved it while it lasted, which was less than six months of infrequent use."
1,Did Not Last,I was really excited about this DVD player. Purchased it and took it to our Disney trip where it worked fine - that was in June. It has not worked since. Here's hoping that the Amazon warranty works.
1,Trash,"We bought this last year to make a very long move, hoping it would keep our daughter entertained. It lasted for the length of 2 movies and then died. The rest of the trip was very long with nothing else for her to do. Couldn't get help on the phone and stuck with $100 worth of junk."
3,great at first,This unit was great for exactly one year. I bought this last year may13 for my daughters birthday. It just stopped working last night may 4.They should last longer then a year.
1,teresa jellum,I am very unhappy and will not be purchasing anything via mail from Amazon again. I received this player as refurbished which may have bene my first mistake. It worked for a couple weeks then stopped working any my daughter just put it in a drawer and didn't tell me. I asked her about it a few weeks ago and she told me it only worked for a few weeks. Apparently it only had a 30-day guarantee and I am past that time frame. It would be cheaper for me to just buy a new one at a store brand-new from a reputable dealer where I can actually go in an speak with a person. My recommendation is to only purchase new and only from a listing that has the name of the actual store you are buying from. It is frustrating having to only do email and not working with a person to provide customer service.
3,Needs AC plug adapter,"This is a decent inexpensive model. Unfortunately, unlike most buyers, I don't have kids to entertain while I'm driving! I take mine with me when I'm working on some mindless job and need distraction or when staying away from home (not at a hotel). I would prefer an AC plug adapter, rather than the ""car kit"". If I'm finished with the movie and working through the ""bonus"" material, the battery runs out. I'm taking it in to Radio Shack to pick up an adapter..."
2,picture freezes and skips,"Great package, great price, and mostly great reviews here on Amazon. I bought one, but the continuity of the picture was so bad it made viewing not enjoyable (I kept the unit plugged in and didn't even use the battery, so I know the battery wasn't the problem). Also when hooked up to an external monitor, the image was too dark, and setting the brightness control to brighter didn't make the picture on the external monitor any brighter.I can't recommend this except for kids watching cartoons or something directly on the screen who aren't sensitive to the jumpy/freezy picture quality. I returned the unit."
1,RIPPED OFF,"I purchased this DVD player as a Christmas present in September and when it was opened in December it would not play as disc drags on door or something. Amazon refused to help and Audiovox said to return it with the original receipt to be repaired in 6-10 weeks. I am awaiting their response and my neices are with out a christmas gift. Ho, Ho, Ho."
4,Works great!,"This is a basic, easy-to-use DVD player. We purchased this product to play sing-a-long videos for our 2 year old while traveling on an airplane. It worked great! The only ""nit"" was that our flight lasted 4-1/2 hours and the batteries ran out. The sound quality is good -- but not great (but hey, who can hear that well on an airplane or in a car anyway?)"
4,The best hands-on book available,"I've been using this book since 1995. It's not the type of book you'd read cover to cover, but it's an invaluable planning resource for any marketing manager. The authors leave no stoned unturned. If you are writing a plan or launching a business, this is the best practical book out there. Other marketing books get bogged down in theoretical case studies that offer no hands-on tools. This book is a great tool."
1,Intimamente o de lejos,"The musicians are all on stage, sitting in couches...don't seem one bit motivated. One song after another, without a change of scenery. Very monotonous. Sound quality was also very poor. The audience seemed to be enjoying the ""performance"".--much more than me, I'm sure."
2,Not so good,"I loved the Pamela's ""simplebites"" cookies but these organic expresso chocolate chunk cookies, which sounded good in the product description, just tasted plain weird to me. The texture is right but the cookies have an off taste, a little like rancid butter. I like these flavors together--coffee and chocolate--but not in these cookies."
1,A real disappointment...,"I knew I was in for a real disappointment when boredom set in within the first 10 minutes of the movie. It's a plotless flick where Seb, who was recently dumped by his boyfriend, begins a quest for a new mate. He meets Georgie at a local 'sauna' and starts a sexual spree where he procees to engage in encounters with nearly anyone who crosses his path. Totally absent of talent, the actors display a lot of flesh, however, strategic camera angles leave everything to the imagiation.All in all it's a pretty worthless film. I rushed out and bought it, and I'm sorry I did!!"
5,A great Movie,"This movie is so good visually. There are about 6 scenes of sexual intercourse, very erotic scenes. Thats all i can say about the movie due to guidelines."
4,EASY ON THE EARS,"Jim Photoglo is one of those talented artists of the 80s who came and went with little fanfare. His only real dent on the Billboard chart was his minor hit, FOOL IN LOVE WITH YOU, which actually is a very catchy tune.PURE LOVE is certainly an enjoyable lightweight effort. Jim delivers ballads reminiscent of Bread's David Gates and mid-tempo tunes in the vein of Michael McDonald, albeit without McDonald's ""smokiness."" The notable tracks on this CD: SILENCE IS KING, PURE LOVE, ANOTHER SEASON WITHOUT RAIN, and WILL OF THE WIND. The brief reprise of PURE LOVE somehow seems superfluous.Photoglo continued recording after PURE LOVE and with his clear, emotional vocals, he delivers pleasant easy listening records."
3,Not quite worth it!!!,"First off, I generally liked Dawn of War. Numerous other reviews address and detail the strengths of this game. In many ways it is a step above the most recent generation of RTS games.What I wish to address is the fact that the solo campaign is comprised of only 12 missions. That's right, 12 missions (about 10 hours). On top of that, you only get to play as Space Marines and not one of the other 3 races (i.e., Chaos, Eldar, Orks). Furthermore, the storyline ends with a cliffhanger that suggests that there will be an expansion released in the future. In my opinion, when you spend $49.99 you deserve a bit more than this. The multiplayer is fine and the single-shot missions are alright but for this amount of money... more story content should be presented."
4,NICE GAME,Finaly a good looking game that isn't so limited like WC3! Bring back the numbers and craziness of CnC.Get it for sure!
5,Very Good.,"First of all, I'm a big RTS fan. It started with Warcraft II, then on to StarCraft, then Warcraft III, then EMPIRES DAWN OF THE MODERN WORLD. I found all very enjoyable. As for DoW...I still have yet to purchase the full game, but the demo alone has given me somethin I've been wanting; an AI thats actually pain in the rear in NORMAL difficulty. I like a challenge...though I'll probably find myself playing the Orks to sate my Starcraft ZERG style strategies of overwhelming numbers sent to the meat grinder..."
5,fully engaging,"If you buy this for the single player game, you will be horrably dissapointed, just don't.If you want to play against real people online, this it a great game.team play, is good1v1 is fantasticsave replays of your wins and losses use those to see what your opponent did right and wrong and use him to improve.visit http://forums[dot]relicnews[dot]com/ for strats and tips (all free,no worries mate)"
3,great game bad story,"I was so please to see a RTS game come out in the WH40K world and I played it straight through. The animations and gameplay are great but there should be more missions. Also, the cutscenes were very long and dull. The actors speaking the voices were not right in my opinion. Play the game, but skip the cutscenes!!"
5,Beautiful,"I bought this case cus I knew it'd be moving around alot at college and back home, and not only is it solid and durable but also has a very nice interior. My Ibanez has a large body and it fit perfectly and the storage compartment is cool as well. I have had 0 problems with this case and would buy another if I could."
4,Good product...,"My son love Mickey, what can I say? It's a nice toy and I got it pretty soon. Thank u."
5,The spirit of the composer captured,"Richard Goode's recording of the 2nd, 4th, and 5th partitas of Bach can be analyzed, compared, contrasted, etc. but what really matters is the way this pianist communicates the spirit of Bach. This is playing neither of false piety nor self glorification.Goode's thorough concept of these pieces is put at the service of the composer and communicates the genuine human nature, faith, and life affirmation which are the hallmarks of Bach's music.More importantly than this or that tempo or such a phrasing, Goode gets through to the meaning of the music. That's why I listen to this recording."
3,"Goode makes a pianistic, but not stylistic impression","Goode plays beautifully, although with a characteristic pianistic approach that shows that Richard is probably more at home with Beethoven than Bach. The unsurpassed recording is still Glenn Gould's Partitas, but Goode brings in a clarity that is becoming. Goode is a good chioce for those that want a straight-forward interpretation, but for those that want more Bach magic and can live with some eccentricity - get Glenn Gould."
3,Clarity above all,"This is generally a very good recording, but I disagree a little with some of the phrasing and tempi. For the D major Partita, the Ouverture is a bit too fast, the dotted rythm becomes jerky if you play it at that speed. The allegro section is then perhaps a little too slow, and also Mr. Goode varies the tempo quite a bit. This is distracting, there seems to be no musical need to do that except in very few places. The Allemande (which to me stands out in all of Bach keyboard music) is pretty, but could be more expressive.Overall it is one of the most sincere and cleanest Bach recordings I know, as there are a lot of very mechanical interpretations around that are exceedingly dull, and do not do justice to the old master. Mr. Goode's record is a good investment as his playing style is timeless.Last but not least: What disastrous marketing person put that very unflattering photo on the cover? I am sorry, but I almost decided not to buy this record because of this."
4,Ginger cookies,"These cookies are especially handy with children because they aren't crumbly like so many gluten free cookies. They have fine flavor, too."
4,Very Yummy for Gluten Free Product,"It is very moist, which is what I like. You can really taste the spices too, which I love. It is very good for a gluten-free product."
1,"Horrible, I prefer never to eat cookies again than have one of these","I didn't know that cookies could taste so bad. This is far better than the lemon shortbread and the chocolate chip, but it isn't saying much. I truly regret purchasing so many boxes for my job and will NEVER EVER trust my coworker for recommending them."
4,Warning: Plastic shard in Exp Date 2011Jan06E Ginger Cookies with Sliced Almonds,"Length:: 0:08 MinsUpdate2: we continue to buy these cookies, and have yet to find another shard.Update1: no more shards since then, so boosted the rating on the product. Company never responded to email to corporate, however. Also, Amazon price is climbing, cancelled the subscription as local price is good enough.Original:One of my family just found a piece of plastic in one of the cookies. It measures about a half inch long, and an eight inch wide, and is thin. It is stiff, and has sharp corners. Fortunately the person didn't get hurt.We love these cookies and have eaten at least dozens if not hundreds this year. This is the first time we have found something in one of these cookies. The cookie came from a package of Ginger Cookies with Sliced Almonds just delivered this week, with the Expiration Date of 2011Jan06E."
1,The Ginger Cookies are YUCK,"I don't know about the others, but I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer who said the Ginger Cookies were AWFUL! Mine went into the trash after I tasted one of them. Save your money!"
3,An informative book on how to teach kids about races.,"I am a college student and I chose this book to read for my Race and Society class. The examples of situations, that could have possibly been avoided, had the kids been taught properly, were a wake up call to me. I never realized how easily kids pick up on small subtle signals that parents send nor did I realize how aware children are of differences. The book was very informative in teaching me about how adults pass signs to kids, unknowingly, and informative on how to teach kids about the multicultural society that we are living in. I am not a parent yet, but I am going into education. I think this has well prepared me for both areas, when the time comes."
3,"Despite some great parts, one of the weaker Fleming books","The whole presence of Jamaica and everything on the around the island was great. Fleming knew the place well. There are some great aspects to this book, but no matter what the handling of the villain--the fascinating Dr. No--was shoddy. His discription of Dr. No is fantastic and the character, or the little we learn of him, is one of the more intriguing villains in all of the Fleming canon. However, his early and rather laughable demise just stinks of having nothing to do with the whole setup. There was a big blank after the death of Dr. No and I was like, huh? The whole point was to dump bird crap on him and wrap up this whole complicated mission. Oh well. It's still a Fleming Bond, and I have yet to read a ""bad"" one. They are ALL good, but some are certainly stronger than others. This is on the weaker end but still very enjoyable."
4,A good read but lacked a little.,"Doctor No is one of the better Bonds but the ending was quite confusing. The ending told very little about how Doctor No died, and when he did infact die, I didn't understand why Fleming would kill the bad guy in such a stupid way. I thought the squid part was one of the worst because it was hard to follow and didn't explain the squid's death very well. There were parts that I did like, however. I enjoyed the introduction to Honey Rider and the dragon part, but I didn't like the fact that Quarrel died. Despite some confusing parts, I still consider it one of the better Fleming novels."
5,"Absolutely an Artist for Everyone ,young and old !!","All the stars in the sky are not enough !!Don has done a Wonderful job this time !! His lyrics speak to many, as does his music ! He has a Great knack for hitting your heart with the feeling he emits in his singing!You simply MUST own this CD ! Parents, kids, anyone !! I've followed him for several years,and NEVER have not loved his music !! Simply a must-own for your collection !!"
5,NOW I KNOW WHY PEOPLE LOVE THIS GUY!!!,"MY FRIEND LOANED ME THE CD AND I COMPLETELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SONGS AND BOUGHT MY OWN AT A LIVE BAND SHOW 0N 2/26/99. THE DON LEWIS BAND WAS AWESOME!!! TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WERE SINGING ALONG, INCLUDING ME. THIS IS WHAT MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT."
5,Beyond Awesome,This is music at it's very best. Don Lewis has to have a huge heart to deliver such emotion in his lyrics. This man has an incredible talent that should not be wasted. Can't wait for the next album. Good luck Don and the band. Don't hesitate to purchase Angel's Cry.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!,"I can't believe someone would rate this costume anything but one star, if that. The fabric is not flannel, it is a cheap knit that will run if pulled and is so thin you can see through it. The pants are cut very short. A man who wears a 40 -48 will have a hard time not showing his bare knees. Do not waste your money, please. With shipping, I spent over $70.00 for something worth 5.00."
1,They lie! This is fake! Scammer!,The pictures are not the same as the costumes! They lie! The goods are from China! This is fake! Scammer!
3,Transatlantic Tunnel,"Not bad for the time in which it was meant for. Details the building of a tunnel from NY to the western side of Europe. Meant for cars to travel. Hero designs the tunnel. Both US and Europe begin digging. Hero's son joins the digging team but dies as he gets caught in volcanic steam as they dig near a volcano. Both sides eventually join each other.Even though it was B&W and faded a little, it was still watchable. Shows visionary futuristic devices (i.e. personal phone calling with TV on both ends so you can see who is calling."
4,Fuctioning well but the buckle is cheaply made,"As far as function wise, it does everything it says. It includes a code to register for the first year MSN Direct service free of charge. I like to stock quote service since it can keep me updated on three major indexes throughout the day. The only gripe I had so far is that the buckle of the strap is made by plastic and it broke after only one week of use. I report the problem to SWATCH and hopefully they can send me a metal buckle replacement."
1,more trouble than they're worth,"I was excited about getting these,(I bought two)but now that I have them, and have used them daily, they are more trouble than they're worth. Plus, they scoot too easily so now I will be looking for rubber grommets of some sort to place on the legs. Very disappointed and whats worse, the shipping charge was $17.00 so I can't send them back. They are very flimsy in construction, they wiggle freely. Also, they do not stand tall enough when the table is at the sharpest angle and whatever is on it (ie: books, pc keyboard) slides off so I have to use a piece of shelf liner. The table does not go under all furniture as the video makes it looks so easy. We have recliners and loveseats with metal framework. All in all, save your money! The table-Mate website offers free shipping on two and a free remote sleeve which was not offered through any sellers on Amazon."
4,Works Well Enough for Meals,"I use this for eating in front of the TV every night for dinner and works just fine for that purpose. Its C-shaped legs enable me to pull it up close to me while I sit back on the sofa. The table surface looks like wood grain but is really just plastic. Other sources on the internet say it can hold up to 50 lbs. May be it can, and maybe it can't. Judging by its sturdiness (or lack thereof) I am not going to try. The Table-Mate II works for what I bought it for, but IMHO I think it is a little too pricey, because of the low quality material."
5,Can't live without it!,"This is the second Table-Mate desk that I have ordered and I could not live without them. I use them in both of my homes as my computer desk. It is sturdy, well made and the perfect size for my laptop. I highly recomment this product for anyone that needs a reliable table top desk for their laptop."
1,Junk,I owned 3 Table-Mate II's before purchasing this one. My other 3 are all white and I decided I would get a wood grain one for another room. What I received was nothing like the other 3 I have. It was made of cheaper material and didn't have the Table-Mate logo on the product anywhere. I immediately request a return. My recommendation is don't wast your money.
2,New Table Model is Inferior to the Earlier Model of the same table,"I have purchased two (2) other Table-Mate II Woodgrain tables previously and am very satisfied with those. However, this one has been changed by the manufacturer. The support bar for the underside of the flat surface has been downsize in diameter. The support bar will not stay in place if the table is lifted as is the case with my previous tables. This makes it very awkward and un-safe when you try to relocate the table to different locations. Can the support bar be replace with the larger diameter bar like the one on the earlier models?Regards,kwm55@mediacombb.net"
1,Horrid Piece of Import Trash,"Our therapist helping grandma had a table mate II and it was perfect. It was better built of thicker materials - both the plastic and the steel were larger and supported more. This ""classic"" actually falls apart when you try to pick it up and barely supports a bowl of oatmeal. It is utter trash. Sad they build something less serviceable to save a few pennies. At most I'd pay for a table like this would be $1. It's more of a liability than a help."
1,not a real table mate,not that i care its real or not but its not a good table at all. do not buy this one find the real table mate with the cup holder that is the one you want.
1,jeep in the villages,"this table is a piece of junk, and vastly overpriced..I bought a similar one for $15.00 at Walgreens, and it is much superior. I would not recommend this item for anyone!"
2,Not Too Sturdy!,"A little disappointing, was not as sturdy as the ones from QVC. Defeats the use of this product, to help others."
2,Cheap!,"Not at all sturdy, rest an elbow on it , it will probably brake. Putting it together, one of the very cheap hard plastic catchers snapped off! Not worth $5.00 never mind $37.00. The last 2 orders I have received from Amazon may be my last!"
4,very good table,"I bought this to place my iPad on it when I sit on the couch. It is not heavy duty, but it's fine for my purpose. I wouldn't put anything very heavy on it, though."
3,"Good, not great.","Good idea but a little flimsy for my tastes. I am going to go to the hardware store and see if I can not find a few things to make it a little sturdier. Otherwise, I think it would be perfect ten dollars less."
1,"don""t buy!!","this table mate is made very cheep. its not sturdy. I have the white ones, but wanted the woodgrain. its like they are two different products."
2,not very stable,"I thought the table will be stable. But it is not stable at all. Got to be very careful when pushing or pulling. Also when the shipment arrived, there was a small broken piece. Since it was not too big, i just kept it and did not want to go thru the hassle of returning it.All in all, not a great table but its ok for 30 bucks."
4,Wood grain Ta le,Lightweight and easy to use. Works as advertised. Stores easily under couch. Met my expectations. Began using it right away.
1,This is a cheap knockoff!,"This is not a Table Mate II - it doesn't even say Table Mate on it, it's a cheap knock off that will not even support my laptop! I have the white table mate II for years and wanted a neutral color, sending this item back, what a pain and a disappointment!"
2,Eh...,"Too self-consciously artsy-fartsy for my taste. This is the sort of movie pretentious people love since it allows them to make a big show of pretending to appreciate something ""challenging"" that a general audience would not ""get"". If you don't have that sort of agenda when watching a movie, however, you might want to stay away from this one. It's deliberately obscure in many places, to the point of self-indulgence and beyond. There was enough in it for me to care vaguely about the Pullman and Byrne characters, but I still felt like I had just wasted 2 hours by the end. It seemed much longer."
1,Political toast with no beef to back it,"Empty space, this movie has no coherent story. In the end, we are told that the government is watching everybody, but somehow, our hero gummed up the works before he disappeared into the night.Awful, preposterous, garbage. If I did not know any better, I might think it is a video game, it barely resembles a movie."
3,Black back of speakers,Using as rear surrounds- Sound is ok for the size of the drivers......The rear of the speakers is black not the silver/gray of the front..
1,Heart Necklace,"My boyfriend purchased the Heart Pendant on the sation pink cord last year sometime. I wore it maybe 2 times and it broke. the cord came completely out of the clasp. He fixed it for me, then the clasp broke. I would not recommend buying this necklace. From what i see, others have had the same problems as I have. ~Amanda"
2,Falls Apart : (,"My boyfriend bought me this necklace for our anniversary last year. I loved it because it was the only piece of jewelry that he had ever got me and he knew that I am obsessed with Paris Hilton. Soon after I started wearing it, the satin cord came undone from the clasp. I quickly replaced it with a stornger silver necklace. Then, one by one the swarvoski crystals strated to come loose and get lost. As of now, three of the eight crystals are missing. The only reason I still wear it is because it reminds me of my boyfriend, imperfect but thoughtful."
5,Unique and with glitz!,"I have really enjoyed this piece. It turned out to be bigger than I expected, but a pleasant surprise. Love the pink with the silver and the rope is definitely a nice way to hold the piece. And it's pink! I too can see how the engraved 'Paris' can be a bit of a turn off, but it's part of the decor in regards to the piece. In my case, this was given to me by my fiance who proposed in Paris, so we made the engraved part work for that memory."
2,Necklace,"I'm not sure on this necklace, I think that it looks cheap. If girls get it because they want to be like Paris then at least get the rosary bead cross necklace (Paris has been seen wearing this a lot). I like most of the Paris Hilton jewellery the worst buys being this and the star necklace on the cord. If you want to buy something from her jewellery line I would recommend that you get one of the necklaces with a real silver chain not a cord chain that will get ruined easily."
1,totally not unique...,"As mentioned before, this necklace is almost exactly like the Elsa Peretti Carved Heart pendant by Tiffany's. Both have a silky cord and carved out heart in sterling silver. Although this one is pink and jeweled, the main difference between the necklaces is in the quailty."
1,cheap knock-off of elsa peretti,who are we kidding here? this is a complete rip-off of the classic elsa peretti heart pendant. i hope tiffany's sues.
1,Hard to believe anyone would buy it.,"I suppose that if you normally shop at a dollar store, this might be for you. Actually you probably get better quality at a dollar store. ""Swarovski crystals"" are fake stones made in China. Not a natural crystal."
2,upset that i can't order this in Canada!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really like this, but cannot order this as it will not ship here to Canada.................grrr"
1,Worst purchase ever,"This was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. This thing is a cheap piece of garbage. It looks cheap, it feels cheap, it IS cheap. Don't waste your money on this nasty necklace. It not only looks like something you get out of a gumball machine but it's not made with any kind of quality either. If I could give this a rating below 1 star I totally would. I hope this necklace burns in hell!"
1,"looks really cute, but is it worth it?","When I first saw this piece on Amazon.com, I seriously gasped. It is sooooooooo cute! And since it is from Paris( my idol) i knew I must have it! Sadly, though when reading other's review, some complain of the crystals falling out, the satin cord falling apart, and the piece being extremely smaller than expected. I mean, I want a nice piece of jewerly, I want it a bit big for others to notice it. I want the cord to hold up for a long time, and I really want the stones to stay in place!!! I mean, for $35 of my OWN money, its GOT to be nice!"
5,Great Necklace!,"This necklace is great. The satin cord is so trendy, and the heart is very pretty with the pink diamonds.I am only 13 years old and plan to get all the other pieces most likely the star necklace and earings. Maybe if I get my belly button pierced in the future I'll get the belly button piece. Anyway the price was right too!"
3,That's hot..,I like the necklace and I think it looks adorable on. I can't believe on the other hand I paid $35 for it just because Paris Hilton's name was attached to it and I love novelty stuff like this. Sure it looks like some other stuff that has been released but it's jewlery...most of it looks the same anyways.So if you have the money and don't mind spending it order away. Everytime I have worn mine since it has arrived I have gotten tons of compliments. Besides we have to let Paris Hilton make a few bucks of her own :0
5,The perfect book... yours!,"These books are great for writing any thoughts, poems, or stories you want to share. Plus, it gives it a good look. You can even write in pen and it won't bleed through because the pages are very durable. Perfect journals, also. A great gift for anyone who loves to write or sketch!"
1,disapointed,"Bought this pump based on glowing reviews to seal dry items in canning jars. Before it broke... it worked beyond my expectations, I was most pleased. However, I was only able to seal a couple jars before it broke, the part holding the pump plunger/rod to the handle went flying and I still haven't been able to find the part. Very disappointed. Had it less than 1 hour before this happened. On a positive note, called Amazon customer support and they where most supportive and have a replacement in the mail, no questions asked."
3,Average at best......,"Bought this tool as a brake bleeder and have to say its pretty useless in that regard.BUT,Ive used to to track down leaking vacuum lines on my truck and in that function has been a fine tool.Build quality,not impressed,seems flimsy yet it IS still working for me.I got my monies worth in unintended function but dont expect high quality,it isnt,its a cheapy functional vacuum tool.If you need and accept it for what it is,you'll be OK with the purchase."
3,Works ok,It works but to get a seal and actually vacuum the air out of the jar is a pain in the butt.
5,hand held vacuum pump,"Although this vacuum pump is ideal, the price should be as low as $19.11....Items such as these are valuable in the Blue collar world.The ONLY people keepingour heads above the B.S."
1,Trash,"Bought it on Weds,got it on Friday,broken on Saturday....Tried to vacuum out a Ball Mason Jar,got it to 20""HG and my seals let go...THANKS AMAZON!!!"
4,Actron CP7830 -- good tool for my low vacuum uses,"I used it to diagnose a car engine problem, low vacuums between 5-10 lb. It worked just fine and the included adapter gadgets came in handy. I wasn't expecting a show-class look and feel but was happy with the mechanical simplicity and build quality. Based on other reviews, I won't use it in applications requiring higher than mid-scale vacuums, so hopefully it'll last a long time. Kudos as usual to the Amazon order fulfillment crew. The pump arrived when promised."
1,"Cheap quality, breaks easily","I've been through two of the pumps so far. Got the first one replaced, will do the same for this one. Would never buy again. Just stopped pulling a vacuum. I use it to seal hops in mason jars using the Foodsaver mason jar attachment. Works great until the pump breaks. Look elsewhere."
4,prepper tool,"This item was purchased to be used along with vacuum tops for ball jars to remove air keeping items fresher for longer periods. Such as, open a box of cereal and put the remaining cereal in the jars with the air removed... Haven't tried it yet, but looks like it's a winner for me."
5,Very Useful Tool,"The Actron CP7830 is a must have tool for the home canner and mechanic. It serves two functions. The first, when used with a Food Saver Jar Sealer allows dried foods to be vacuum sealed in a Mason type jar. Thus preventing infestation of unwanted life forms. The second function was to use it to locate a pesky vacuum leak in my '93 Ford Ranger. It paid for it's self, in a few minutes. I store it in a Zip-Loc freezer bag to keep it clean! Jerry Thompson, Lake Butler, Fl"
1,"Its super sucky, but not in a vacuum kind of way.","It lost its ability to get more than 15"" after only a few pumps. Couldn't even finish the job, returned."
4,A tribute to a genius and a true patriot,"I thought the book was very interesting and hard to put down.The detail was amazing until I realized the subject had kept notes of his early career. It left me wishing for more information about his war and post-war career. While the intricisies of the cryptanalytic processes described were hard to follow sometimes,enough information was given to keep the reader's interest. A real tribute to a genius and a national treasure. The book aroused my patriotic emotions."
5,Excellent Read,"In The Clock Shop, Richard Ashland has managed to cross over multiple genres and create a wonderful story that is rooted in realistic and ""relatable"" human relationships, yet also bounds excitingly into the realms of the spiritual and scientific unknown. I do not want to give too much away, though my enthusiasm for the book leaves me sorely tempted to do so. Let it suffice to say that I sincerely hope that I have not seen the end of Charles Rikker. He's a great character, and I believe there is a lot of life left in him."
3,Before Mr. Ed there was Francis!,"My mom and brothers and I used to watch these movies and laugh like crazy. Watching them now, however is quite different. We used to be so easily entertained in the 50's. Watching Francis and Donald O'Connor is a treat even though I am not as entertained as when I was a child. It is a nostalgic treat. I still think these are classics!"
5,Francis' Adventures,I haven't seen these in years. They were as good as I remember them. Good quality video and audio especially for an old B/W movie. Woth the money if you are a Francis or Donald O'Conner fan
3,Francis,My wife remembered this from somewhere and we have enjoyed it---each disc has been viewed a couple of times since we received it---basically very clean but very much all with the same general plot.
1,unable to rate the itam,"Unfortunately, the item was not compatible with my equipment and I had no alternative but to return it."
3,Confusing TCP Part# - beware,"Received what I ordered and in good condition.Unfortunately it is not what I needed and due to the relative high cost of shipping, returning is not worth the effort! I guess that is a disadvantage of buying from Amazon Marketplace vendors like Light Bulbs Etc. I sent an email to the vendor accepting my mistake and asking for options but they never bothered to reply - I am wondering if they are dependable enough.Be careful with the misleading TCP (manufacturer) Part#. TCP #32030 is apparently the same for thicker tube T9 as well as thinner T6. Both items have the same outer diameter and even work with the same ballast. But being different thickness, they will not install the other's mounting bracket. I have the T6, which NONE of the local big chains carry so ordered it online, only to waste my money.Personally, I would not buy this brand again considering difficulty in getting their parts. This is sad because the product works really well."
2,Not Satisfying,"No information on Direct3D, DirectPlay or DirectInput; The included game is slow and turn-based. Some good points, perhaps more useful for total beginners."
1,Rip Off,Thought this was an e-book. Turns out they charge you 9.95 just to view a citation of a book. Why are they charging for this when you can get this at any library catalog. What a rip-off!!!
3,Broad but shallow,"Of the 1030 pages in this book, approximately 250 pages are spent on a Pentium assembly-language tutorial -- while barely 40 pages are spent on all of memory-caching. Virtual memory gets another 20 pages. USB gets 10 pages, IEEE 1394 gets 5 pages, and PCI gets a whopping 12 pages. There's no discussion of the current APIC interrupt controller (vital for multi-processor systems), while the outdated 8259 PIC chip is presented as the interrupt controller of choice for Pentium systems.As a practicing engineer, I seriously question both the topics the author has chosen and the weight he has given to them."
4,Love Song Crooning in One of its Better Incarnations!,"I remember as a boy really enjoying listening to ""Fool In Love With You"" and ""We Were Meant To Be Lovers"" and indeed it was really for these 2 tracks that I got this effectively best of album of Jim Photoglo - all except 2 of the tracks on this album come from the albums ""Fool In Love With You"" and ""Photoglo"". Jim's music falls into that same genre that was very popular in the early 80s to which also belong the likes of Robbie Dupree, John O'Banion and Paul Davis and if you like these guys' work, you will also love this album by Jim Photoglo. The whole album is a great representation of the soft, mellow love song genre and the sound quality is really good for an unremastered album. A great album to get for all the lovers and romantics out there."
1,not original recordings,"It looked to be a pretty good CD until I played it for the first time. Tracks 3 and 5 seemed to be original, but the rest were re-recorded. Anybody out there like to pay double for a CD only to find it's not the original recordings? I don't. This was a rip."
5,My kids love it!!!!,Santa got this for my 4 year old daughter and my 20 month old son. They both love this slide. I would recommend this to anyone...as long as you have the room. It is a little big but not huge.
1,Horrible,We ordered this slide for our son for Christmas. We put it together Christmas eve and found the slide was missing several pieces and scuffed up like it had been used. Thank goodness he is only 2 and didnt realize Santa brought him a busted slide... We were so upset we decided to return it and look elsewhere. We ended up getting one that is still little tikes but is exclusively sold at Target.
1,What evil manevolent force came up with this assembly?,"Absolutely the worst toy to assemble that I have ever encountered. As with other purchasers of this awful awful slide, getting the tube through and the caps to stick on was nearly impossible. I did succeed, but only after significant contortions and more than a few curse words. I've never cursed over putting together a toy. Never. Even the bike from China with the poorly translated instructions were easier than this.Little Tikes, here's a few suggestions:1. Don't ask the customer to hammer the end of a pliable plastic tube in order to jam it into a cap and then expect the tube to remain straight enough to thread through six holes.2. Spend the $0.50 and provide the stupid wooden block.3. Change the order of assembly so that first thread the tube of frustration, then cap it on both sides, then attach the stairs. Trust me, it would have been easier that way."
1,Horrible assembly,"I agree with all who complaint about the assembly. It is one of the worst product to assemble. Little tikes should add a metal rod and some other type to lock the bolt.One other problem is that it throws off the the baby if the clothing is slippery.And also, is very narrow and does not provide enough spae for the child to position properly before sliding down."
2,I agree,"I agree with the previous review, my child used this slide at a toddlers group and first time down fell face first as his feet caught on the bottom of the slide, it needs a smoother landing. As far as giving it 5 stars for educational value......it's an education on how to land face first, he now puts his hands out to save himself, that's all he learned :o( Having used this at toddlers I will not be adding it to my yard toys."
1,wish we hadn't bought it,"I wish we hadn't bought this slide because it is really unsafe. The problem is that the slide is fast and ends abruptly at the floor, without any kind of safety lip or drop. A child sliding down this slide will go down really fast, then jam his feet into the floor and catapult forward. Most slides end 6-12 inches from the floor. Now we know why!"
4,New metal rod makes assembly much easier,"After reading everyone's reviews, my wife and I were quite skeptical of this product because of the reported difficulty with the assembly. However, we went ahead and purchased the slide for our son for Christmas (2007). It seems that Little Tikes has solved the assembly problems by supplying a sturdy metal rod rather than the plastic rod that seemed to be giving people so much trouble. With the metal rod, assembly was quite easy and took me only about 20-25 minutes.I'm not sure how much my son likes the slide since it's not Christmas yet, but I'm hoping it will be a big hit."
1,Agreed. Assembly a nightmare.,"I just got this slide and my kids were going nuts waiting for me to assemble it. This plastic tube just does not easily hammer into the red caps. I tried heating the caps up to expand their diameter, tried sanding down the black platic tubing. All to no avail. An hour later, the slide is half assembled.I'd have paid an extra 5 bucks to have this thing pre-assembled. Terrible."
3,Love the slide!,"Bought this slide as a gift for my grandson to use as an inside slide. Love the slide, but can't get the platform piece on the bottom to fit. That was why I bought this slide because thought it would be more stable."
5,Can't wait,I bought this last week and it arrived on monday! I'm so excited to give it to my 18 month old. She will love her Santa gift!!
5,Little Tikes slide is the best gift for my granddaughter!,"I got this slide for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday, and she had so much fun with it (and her friends)! It is durable, easy to put together, and easily stored."
5,pumpkin,"My daughter loves this slide. She plays on it about once every hour still, but she has always loved slides at the park. She is tall for her age, but the length of the slide is perfect. She will be able to use this for a couple more years. We are in an apt, so don't have much space, and there isn't a park closer than 2 miles to us, so this slide really fits the bill for us."
1,WORST slide ever made!,"I purchased this slide for my two year old son. My husband had a terrible time trying to assemble it, only to find out in end that the supporting arm does not stay in the slot. This slide is very unsafe without a locking supporting arm, and it pops out every time our son tried to use it. We have to stand there and hold it down so that the slide doesn't just fall flat while he is on it. Also, our son is tiny for his age and barely fits on this slide because of how narrow it is! Terrible slide!!"
4,A great early confidence builder,"We use this slide indoors. It's wonderful for days when the weather is awful or when you just want to stay indoors. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had included some additional features for educational value, perhaps on the side of the stairwell for instance..."
4,My son loves this slide,"My toddler son has been sliding down slides since he could walk so the smaller slides have lost their excitement for him. This slide is fast, but he goes down over and over and doesn't lose interest. We haven't had any trouble with his feet jamming at the base of the slide, although he does skip once on his butt. All in all, he loves the slide and we are glad we bought it."
5,Wonderful purchase!!,"We purchased this slide for a 2 year old girl and she LOVES it! The assembly wasn't as difficult as some make it sound, however, the slide didn't just slip together either, with almost every step there was a ""snap"" to the assembly, showing that the slide was well assembled and wouldn't just fall apart! I recommended this to my sister and she just purchased it for her 14 month old, they also did not have any issues with the assembly! Read the instructions and follow each step completely, come with a full glass of patience and you'll be just fine! Although the kids do slide off the end if they're wearing slippery clothing, neither child minds! Sometimes the 2 year old will even put a towel at the top to ride on which makes her go even faster. If your kids are riding on this with socks (no shoes), they will go fast. As with all toys, adult supervision is required, at least until your child gets used to the slide. I would definitely recommend this purchase!"
3,Tough assembly. Lot of fun afterwards,"I totally agree with all the reviews about tough assembly. I almost returned it. It took more than an hour to get the infamous plastic tube go through the holes and get the clamps hammered into it.Once it was done, kids are really enjoying it !! They are having lot of fun. I get horrible memories of assembly whenever I see it."
4,Assembly is not that difficult,"I was able to assemble the slide within 20 minutes, as other reviewers have. I can't imagine anyone needing four hours and a drill. When putting the rod in, I put a wire coathanger (unbent with a small hook at the end) in the rod to both guide it through the holes and tug it. Worked like a charm.Our 21 month old daughter loves the slide. At 5 feet long, it is twice as long as the slides on other climber playsets (i.e. the Step2 Woodland Climber).Like any outdoor play equipment, we put a good six inches of soft wood chips on the ground surrounding the slide for safety."
3,Sooo... hard to assemble!,"This slide is cute and provides plenty of fun for my 3 year old and 5 year old who are luckily thin, I can't imagine a child of average-above average weight fitting on this narrow slide. The assembly was a nightmare. The black plastic tube that is supposed to fit into these red caps and through the slide was entirely too big for the caps and extremely difficult to get through the holes in the slide. I went to Lowes and Home Depot at the suggestion of another reviewer to find a metal pipe with a slightly smaller diameter to no avail. I finally just wittled the thing down on each end with a sharp knife to fit it into the red caps. It worked but it's ridiculous that I went to so much trouble to assemble something that should have been pre-assembled and folded into the box it came in."
3,"Daughter loves it, husband hates it","Our daughter loves this slide. She had played on a similiar slide at a playgroup, and I decided to get her one for indoors at home during the winter months. Well, while she does love it, it is bigger than I thought it would be. We're going to be rearranging our furniture for a while trying to find a good place to put this.The cons? This is the fourth Little Tikes toy we've gotten where, in order to assemble it, my husband has to create holes where there previously were none. It seems they need to step up the quality control at Little Tikes because there were several spots on the toy where you should be able to just screw two pieces together, except one of the pieces is missing the hole. And the rod that connects the steps to the slide is plastic- obviously somebody wanted to save a few bucks because it should really be steel.He has made me promise to buy all future toys of this sort from Step 2."
4,No Assembly Parts Sent With Slide,"Slide was shipped without assembly parts I had to order replacement from Little Tikes because Amazon states that I must contact manufacturer. Little Tikes will not credit me for parts so I am basically paying about 10% more for this slide than I purchased it for. Also Amazon is not allowing me to dispute the order. Update:Amazon provided me a refund for the parts that I had to order from Little Tikes to put the slide together. It is unfortunate that I could not find a method online to dispute the order so I had to complain to the BBB.For now I am the supporting base for the slide until the parts are shipped by Little Tikes but my son does love the slide, he even tries to lean the slide against our trampoline so he can use it."
5,Slide-r-ific,We got this slide for our backyard. I picked this one because it was longer than the other slides I saw. My four year old enjoys it yet it isn't too big for my 1 year old. Sometimes we put it in the pool and the slide into it. It folds pretty well but I had a hard time assembling it. I reccommend having a strong man do it for you!
4,Birthday gift for 3 yr old,"Gave slide to 3yr old grandson for birthday. He seems to like it fine. Assembly was not difficult, but hinge rod at top of slide was about 1"" too short and we had to really press the sides of the slide together to get the end cap fasteners on.Slide was delivered in a box that was almost completely destroyed in shipment. Luckily, no parts were missing and slide was not damaged."
1,Not Advised For Children or Adults,"I wish my wife had found these reviews before buying this item. Our experience mirrored precisely what others have complained of here. The plastic tube that is meant to join the ladder and the slide portion, serving as the top hinge, does not easily tap into the caps that are meant to secure it in place at the ends. Instead, the plastic tube splinters and shears at the end that makes contact with the first cap; it then flattens as you hammer it to increase the diameter further at the other end (making it less likely that the second cap will ever seat). It's nice to know that Little Tikes hasn't responded to customer complaints about this and that they continue to marked the same ill-fabricated junk. They should've done right by the consumer and used a metal connecting rod."
2,Don't buy this. Slide width is too narrow. And the kids dont land safely.,"I bought this with lots of expectations that my 2 year old son would love this and he can play on it alone all the time, as he does it in his daycare in the slide. But alas, I'm disappointed. The assembly was really horrible.. I'd a little hope that but for the assembly it would be a great toy for my son. But then, the width of the slide is too narrow that a slightly healthier child cant rest their full back on the slide. While sliding down, they dont land safely. My son is actually thrown a feet ahead in the front with his face down, as he is thin and my friend's daughter gets her back of her head hit at the base of the slide, as she is chubby and not thrown away. For either kids, its not safe. And my son is terrified to play alone on this. He needs our help. Not a great toy!"
2,Assembly Nightmare,"I got his slide thinking it would be easy...wow was I wrong. It took me 4 hours and a trip to Home Depot to by a drill. My slide didn't have holes drilled where the support attachment goes, so I had to drill my own holes, which turned into a nightmare. I can not for the life of me get the caps on, but the slide works without them so far. I will have to work on them some more though. I still don't know if it is together properly because the base is leaning forward, however that is the only way I could get the support arm to attach. I would have promptly returned this, but I live pver an hour from Toys R Us...I made the mistake of not reading reviews before purchasing. For the price I pai ($80) it should not have taken 4 hours to put together plus additional expenses for a drill. The instructions need written directions too and just not pictures."
5,Great slide,"I did a lot of research on slides. This slide is the best. It's durable, it doesn't get too hot in the sun, and my 2 1/2 year old twins love it. The 6 year old boy neighbor also loves it. Easy to transport from the front to the back yards. Can't comment on storability of it though because I keep it outside. If you want a durable slide, this is it. And the height of it is great too. My girls absolutely love it."
4,Magnaflow exhaust tips...,"These gorgeous looking exhaust tips with their mirror finish definitely made a difference to the rear appearance of my Lexus IS. 4"" tips do look a lot different than the stock 2"" ones that came on the car.Highly recommended for people wanting that sporty exhaust look without wanting to get whole new exhausts!"
3,Jane Austen,"A serious, non dramatized look at a woman who has survived the ages. The beauty of her words, the flow of the conversations are music to the ears of a rattled 21st century woman. Thank you Jane."
2,Borrow or rent this selection,"As I stated in my heading this movie didn't work for me at all no interesting fight scenes, typical story line nothing special rent or borrow is what I recommend dont waste your money."
3,"faux lining, small sizing at toe","Pros:Slim design, feminine looking, fits nicely around ankle, good arch support, right height, walk easily.Cons:Faux leather lining - not breathable and uncomfortable. My opinion, boots should have fabric lining if not leather lining to make it breathable. I have dry feet but within an hour I started to feel they need to be unzipped.Sizing is half to one size small. This boot is tight at one inch from toe. I normally wear a 7M, but got a 7.5 B of this boot only be able to wear sheer stocking with it. Changed to a size 8 B, which fits comfortably with winter socks. Other than the toe, it feels true to width.five star to the style,a star off for lining another off for sizing."
5,AWESOME BOOT!!!,This boot is extremely comfortable as far as boots go. I have a hard time finding stylish shoes that I can wear because of two surgeries on my left foot. It is very stylish and the heel is not too high but just high enough. It look great with jeans. The first time I wore them I got a lot of compliments. I bought them in black but I think that the other colors are really sharp as well. You won't get a better price anywhere else either.
3,What it is about?,"I was expecting this movie will show more kayaking but it's more about ""How bad we are to the planet Earth..."". I know we are - but beside that I want to watch kayaks and enjoy them. Great for GreenPeace guys."
4,Best of plus some,"I am not a huge Best Of Fan when I own every album, but this collection has a few gems added to the CD, plus, it has the more popular tunes in ones place. Though my favorite songs are not on this CD, that is why I own all of the 7D albums that i do. This is a good addition to your music collection, but I would suggest the Double-Wide Live album first before this, if you like their music, but want to hear a different side of sevendust. They still rock acoustically, and I love their remakes and renditions. This is good for someone that is just getting introduced to Sevendust also, or if you can only take a few CDs, you may as well grab your favorite bands' Greatest Hits sets."
1,Not Good,"I been hearing of Sevendust since the late 90's, and listen to nothing but rock on the radio (classic, hard, alternative). The music is bland and sounds like every other hard rock band in the last 10 years. Hollywood produced rock-beats with no soul, no meaning, no voices the complaints continue. Don't waste your money, its like listening to the ""Click Click Boom"" song (and thats every song on the album)."
2,TVT should be ashamed,"TVT sucks! i know they have the right to release this, but could have waited until the ""next"" cd had its proper run. But who cares when they arent on the label anymore right? no WRONG! Most fans dont see the fact that this is just pure money gauging! sucks! Not good for the band either when they are trying to promote a cd that came out less than 3 months prior... too bad, because the music on here is great! just bad for fans and the band themselves... selfish!!!"
1,"It's not because the CD actually sucks, it's because people are boycotting TVT!","alright, if it was winedark releasing this cd, i'd probably give it a 4. but i would have waited until the ten, maybe fifteen-year mark before putting out a greatest hits record. when i first saw the cd, i was actually pissed off at the band, thinking ""why the hell would they do this? so early in their careers?!"" then i saw the giant f*cking TVT logo on the back. i put it back on the shelf and downloaded the bonus tracks off kazaa in a matter of minutes. simple as that.F*CK TVT, don't buy this cd, pirate the bonus stuff just to p*ss them off, and pray every night that TVT president steve gottleib goes bankrupt (he already had to sell off the rights to Pretty Hate Machine by nine inch nails). or maybe trent reznor, vince hornsby and sony mayo will take turns --the rest of this sentence is in violation of Amazon.com's review policy--.wow. where did THAT last line come from?"
3,Not bad,"Overall, it was not a bad purchase. The CD itself was just fine, but the case had several very large cracks on it. I realize that this isn't a huge deal, but I still would have preferred a fully intact case."
5,Very interesting book. Essential Reading for the Scalzi fan!,"I really liked this book, but it is admittedly offbeat. It's short, but very well done. More of a psychological story than science fiction, the reader is given the opportunity to get to know the mind of Jane Sagan. Her viewpoints are interesting and there are some unexpected and quirky twists and turns to her internal logic. I gave this a high rating to reward the very successful writing exercise that John Scalzi has undertaken. It's refreshing and unorthodox. Hope to see more of these experiments from Scalzi!!"
4,Great Short Story,"I've read the ""Old Man's War"" trilogy. I loved the universe John Scalzi created. I was more than happy to see ""Zoe's Tale"" and this book were added to the trilogy. This book is less than a hundred pages and takes place across the first two books of the trilogy. It's all about Jane's birth into this new world, war, friendship, and love. It's a nice read and gives a little further insight into this powerful character.This book is also available for free now at the publishers website but I felt compelled to add this hardcover edition to my collection. It was the least I could do for this author who had created so many hours of entertainment for me."
2,Novella in the same universe as Old Man's War,"The Sagan Diary -- life from the perspective of Jane Sagan -- is not what you would expect after reading Old Man's War, The Ghost Brigades, or even The Last Colony. It's much more impressionistic, and offers only snapshots of Sagan's experiences. Buy it if you want the complete Scalzi collection, but don't expect it to add much more plot or detail to the series. It's not bad, just different. I'd rate it above two stars, but not quite three."
2,Stream of Consciousness Ramblings,"Entries from the diaries of Jane Sagan giving her viewpoint on some of the events of Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades. This is not really a story, just a meditation on various aspects of life that are loosely linked together by the chronology of the Old Man's War series. I guess it is supposed to provide some deep insights, but to me it was just pretentious, dull meanderings that loses the entertaining aspects of the novels in the series."
2,The Sagan Diary,I was just surprised by the length - really short. Perhaps I should look at lengths of books - I wasn't expecting a short story.....
2,Contemplation of the Belly Button,"I have thoroughly enjoyed John Scalzi's novels based upon the geriatric warriors of his OLD MAN'S WAR. I did not enjoy this shorter entry.It purports to be the diaries of Jane Sagan, the Special Forces soldier and love interest of the primary character of the series. It is a self reflective piece examining such issues as the meaning of life and the morality of killing. It is a series of memories. To make much sense of this work, one would need to be familiar with the other books.I can see how this might have been useful as an internal work to flesh out the character of Jane Sagan for the novels but as a stand alone work for the reader of those novel, it is boring.Some may like this book. I did not."
2,The Sagan Diary,"I wasted my money on this book. Written in response to some kind of challenge,...?... it added nothing to an otherwise fine series."
1,Don't do it,"I really enjoyed the Old Man's War universe that Scalzi has created. I would have purchased this for my kindle for the measly $3 irregardless to what the reviews stated. However, I would like to give others the benefit of my experience and they can obviously do like I did and do what they please. Note that this short story was not written in the same style as the first three books in the trilogy. (Or the even shorter ""Questions for a Soldier"" which I did enjoy.) The ""Sagan Diary"", as another reviewer put it is ""A Non Stop Stream of Literary Diarhea"". I cannot say it any clearer.I have no problem with an artist expressing his thoughts in a different manner. Its just that in the past I have seen artists do this by creating an entirely new line of work to do it within."
5,Amazing and wonderful,"This novella is related to Scalzi's Old Man's War trilogy - it goes right between The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony.This is a lovely and moving book; it makes me smile, it makes me laugh, sometimes it can even make me cry. The insight into the mind of Jane Sagan, and into the lives of the members of the Ghost Brigades, is really amazing."
3,Not what I was expecting.,"Based on the description, I was expecting a re-telling of Old Man's War/Ghost Brigades, just from a new perspective and hopefully with some new insights. But this is a very different piece from those, with a stream-of-consciousness type style that I found difficult to follow. Very different from Scalzi's other work. It did have some interesting insight's into Sagan's character and feelings, but I didn't find it particularly enjoyable to read."
2,Not for everyone,"The premise and style of the book are very interesting and I applaud John for his creativity and ability to write from a feminine perspective (See John's blog 'The Whatever.' He has a post up to a web page that analyzed the prose and determined the author was a woman.)Overall I found this book a bit of a chore. By chapter 4, I was bored, wondering where the amorphous narrative was going, and slogging through the rest was unappetizing at best.I heartily recommend John Scalzi's other SciFi works, but not this one."
3,"Good for completists, not necessary for the story","I really love Scalzi's ""Old Man's War"" series, and technically this book is part of it, though as he reveals in an afterword, he wrote it for the winning bidder of a charity auction. It doesn't add much to the series, but it's a nice read for deeper psychological insight to the character of Jane Sagan and her inhuman humanity."
1,Too much of a departure.,"Sagan spends the whole book contemplating her navel. It's not just introspection, it's boring introspection. I listened to the audiobook, and this is the first book I've listened to at 2x speed. I kept hoping something would happen, but it did not.I will grant that the author wanted a departure from the action of the prior two books in the Old Man's War series, and if it were well done that would be fine. Sagan writes a love letter to the protagonist of book one explaining all she is giving up to be with him.The problem is that I don't think Sagan is the horrible poet she is made to be. The book is full of poor verse. It does not advance the story, and ultimately is a disservice to the character."
1,A another user wrote,"What an absolute disappointment. Each successive book in the series has gotten worse.The Sagan Diary is total garbage. As another user wrote""A Non Stop Stream of Literary Diarhea""Please allow me to add my humble and heartfelt+1"
3,Very short,"I think I'd be a little bit peeved if I'd paid the recommended retail for this book, because its a 100 page book (in an unusually large font), and they want $45 for it. Sure its a limited edition, but that's a lot of money for what is basically a short story. I paid $18, and I still think that's a lot of money for this much book. This book is a series of reflections on the life of Jane Sagan. These are beautiful, but if you're expecting a book in the same vein as the rest of the Old Man's War books you'll be disappointed.[...]"
1,Overpriced Exploitaion of loyal readers,"Priced like a fully written popular novel, this contrived book should have been a 99 cent pamphlet.Scalzi is a great writer, but make sure you know what his next offerring really is before spending money on him.The book is emotional tripe without clear context. You need a better memory than mine to match the emotional ramblings to the events in the Old Man's War series."
2,Pitiful,"Scalzi - It's fine if you want to get in touch with your inner child and put your feminine side on display in print. But please don't pretend to pass it off as another installment of The Old Man's War. You could of just called it "" A man and his pansy thoughts"" and I would've still bought it because you're just that good. I just wouldn't have wasted a really good cigar and some fine twelve year old bourbon on it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Sagan Diary begins with a tech type whingeing about how the specially grown Special Forces types aren't really allowing full access to their brainpal records when they change to new bodies for settlement.It then changes to Jane reminiscing, somewhat lyrically at times about stages and times in her life before she undergoes a body swap to go and settle on a planet.The audio version is read by several different women, some sf writers."
1,waste of time,incoherent ramblings about Lt sagans feelings. Lost intertest early and wound up just skimming through it looking for something intertesting. The afterword explians it was written due to a request from a friend. teh author didnt try very hard to make it a story.
2,Don't see the point,"Love the Perry/Sagan-series. This is the weakest of them. The few pages don't add much to that universe. Not that it's so bad, it just is unnecessary. Whatever. Fans will buy it anyway, the price isn't all that high (but should have been 0.99, imho), and you don't feel completely ripped off."
5,Lieutenant Sagans diary as she leaves the special forces,It is a very short spot between the first and second books of Old Mans War. Sagan writes to herself a novel about her experiences and changes since she met John.
3,A little dry,Very philosophical but it only took me a day to read it. Not as interesting as his novel. Worth the read.
2,The Sagan Diary,"It was like reading ""Cliff's Notes"" for a real book to follow. After I read the history of how it came about I understood that is exactly what I got. Not the fullness of character developement I have come to exspect. I would have liked a book that had a little more stand alone quality. If you had not read the series it would have been very disappointing."
3,OK - but Miyazaki it aint,I thought these were Miyazaki films after seeing the Castle of Cagliostro - sadly they're not. Good fun but not in the master's league.
5,I love this collection.,I love the collection of the Lupin movies the difference in the movies than the series is funimation dubb the movies but pionner geneon dubb the series. The characters even look different especially Fujiko. Lupin in the movies he's more of a fighter which is awesome.
1,Can't review what I don't have.,"I have been waiting for it to come through the regular mail system, but it hasn't arrived. I wrote a complaint, but the people who sent it replied they don't do refunds. So I am totally dissatisfied with my purchase, and probably will not buy products through Amazon anymore."
3,Pricey for what you get,"I was disappointed in this toy. Once I ordered it and received it...I found a set that was the exact same plus dishes and cups at IKEA for much much less. Not worth the price, unless you only need this to complete your child's play set. All in all the quality is decent."
4,Great little silverware,"These are great little spoons, forks and knives. I bought them to eat an actual meal with, and they were fine, but the dullness of the fork tines was more in line with pretend eating."
3,Fundamentally just a reporter,"I found ""Foreign Correspondence"" fundamentally unsatisfying despite some entertaining passages and a few clever insights. The journey of self-discovery is too external: for example, why did the author convert to Judaism, outside of her marrying a Jew and having an adolescent romantic crush on anything she viewed as exotic? Brooks structures the book around seeking out her childhood pen pals, but offers no real insight into their lives or hearts. Brooks is not very probing; she remains just a reporter. Although she prides herself on an exacting use of language, I noticed several errors--for example, ""problematic"" used to mean ""full of problems"" and ""base"" used instead of ""bass."""
1,A bland book from Bland Street,"The girl from Bland Street has written a very bland book indeed. She has inflicted on the worldyet another tedious, self absorbed ""memoir"". Onereviewer said it best when she described this bookas belonging in Readers' Digest. The prose sinks like lead. Humorless and boring."
4,Fascinating,"I am a great fan of Geraldine Brooks' novels. This one is about her own life and is extremely interesting. In this age of email, twitter and facebook, it is strange to think of people having pen pals back in the day ...."
3,The Friendly Letter,"Foreign Correspondence - Geraldine Brooks3 starsForeign Correspondence is a memoir of Geraldine Brook's childhood in Australia. She describes how she sought to expand the horizons of her suburban environment by corresponding with pen pals in several countries. As an adult she reflects on the ways her early letter writing was a factor leading to her career as a journalist and war correspondent. In the last third of the book, Brooks recounts her efforts to meet her former pen pals as adults.This was a pleasant, insightful memoir. Brooks did a good job of tying the individual stories of her various pen pals together. I was reminded of the episodic structure of People of the Book."
3,Fireign Correspondence: A Pen Pal's Journey from Down Under to All Over,The book is a nostalgic look into the author's past. She was able to relate what was going on in different parts of the world at the time of her childhood and as an adult through the letters of her friends and visit the changes in the world and the characters as she and the world matured. It was a wonderful trip around the world.
2,EL STINKO!,"Larry Graham was(and probably still is)one of the greatest pluck bassists of all time.(They say he was the first bass player to pluck)I own a majority of Graham's albums, and this has got to be the worst ever! Alot of old school artists tend to rely on some of the new artists to help them produce their new projects. NOT! I think these artists should just find it in themselves to create the good music they used to make or just call it quits. He had some help from Prince on this and it still sounds wacked! This is $11.99 plus tax that I will never recover."
4,THE PRINCIPAL Grades High Even 20 Years Later,"The film centers upon a down-on-his-luck principal who has been hired to turn around a troubled school - which was the subject of many films at the time of its release. However, the trouble this school faced wasn't low math scores. Guns, gangs, rapists, and teen pregnancies were the issues that this principal faced. I remember thinking at the time that some of the scenes (though tension filled and dramatic) were a bit over-the-top. However, due to recent events on the news, the film doesn't seem that illogical after all.The acting in the film is spectacular from all involved and there are just enough light moments to not make the movie entirely depressing. It's Jim Belushi, after all! Like DIGGSTOWN, the ending will unexpectedly grab you. Don't be surprised if you end up adding THE PRINCIPAL to your collection."
4,the principal,"once saw this movie. saw that it was available in dvd, closed caption format. part of my collection of james belushi movies."
3,No learning at this school,"A fun movie, even though it's unlikely. This school has so many problems, it would be closed down immediately. They should have the National Guard in every classroom, teachers with tear gas, metal detectors, etc.. No parent would allow their kids to attend. But this is 1987 when even principals smoked in the halls."
4,Review of The Principal,Great movie. James Belushi is very good in it. I think it is probably the best of his dramatic career. There's some funny stuff to which is Belushi's forte but he is pretty good at the gritty stuff too!
4,One of my favorite Belushi performances,Belushi and Gossett jr. are kick ass in this film. If you're a fan of films like Lean on Me or The Substitute you'll enjoy this flick.
3,It is a good movie for the price,The Principal is a good movie for the cost. It sure would be wonderful if it was reality but unfortunately not.
4,"""He's The Principal Man!""","Jim Belushi, Louis Gossett Jr. and Rae Dawn Chong star in this 1987 drama.A teacher is chosen to be principal of a drug-infested high school. I'vealways liked this film and think it's one of Belushi's best. This dvd hasgood picture and sound, but only the trailer. I recommend this."
3,James Belushi should have gotten an oscar for this...,"So then why do I only give 3 stars? Well, for one the movie was not as long as I hoped it would be and I also didn't care too much for the abrupt ending. Despite all that The Principal is probably the most realistic story of a man who even though has serious difficulty turning a trashy high school into a somewhat safer learning environment, manages to slowly succeed while firmly enforcing his rules. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was based on a true story. I've seen movies like this such as Lean on Me, Dangerous Minds, High School High, and the Substitute but The Principal is the most realistic (not to mention more entertaining) film of the ""Teacher vs. dangerous schools"" scenario and I never seem to tire of it."
3,James Belushi gets a promotion,"Following an arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct, schoolteacher Belushi is transferred to the worst school in the district and designated the new principal. Except for some halfhearted support from some of the faculty and a few students, he's all on his own. That sets the tone of the story, because most of the student body is out to get him. Louis Gossett Jr. is solid as the school security guard, and so is Rae Dawn Chong as a teacher that Belushi is able to make headway with. The fine performances and some gripping tension lift this above some of the other ""violent youthgang"" movies."
4,Good movie,I enjoy this movie. James Belushi is a solid actor and can be very funny at times. This is an interesting role for him.
4,Well written with a few twists for good measure.,"I read the book when it first came out in hard cover while on a summer trip to Florida. I could't put it down. The book is well written and provides a look into a white-collar scam for cash gone bad, and a unique solution to the problem. If you can find it at a used book store, buy it."
5,Turbo music CD,If you like the Power Rangers and or collect their music this is a good one to have. As time goes by the music may be harder to find.
5,this soundtrack is awsome.,this soundtrack very awsome when i hear it was so so awsome and i give this soundtrack 5stars this soundtrack is popular.
3,Practice makes perfect.,"This hit and miss album not only features music from Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie but from the preceeding Fox Kids broadcasted series ""Power Rangers Zeo"" such as the earthquaking songs ""Calling for a Hero"" and ""Enemies Beware"". Like the movie, the sequal's soundtrack corrects many mistakes made in the previous film such as re-introducing elements from the original television series."
4,from the book cover,"This volume contains the first complete edition of Jonathan Edwards' private biblical notebook known as ""Notes on Scripture,"" drawn from his own manuscripts. Compiled by Edwards over a period of nearly thirty-five years, this text confirms the centrality of the Bible in his thought."
3,They are okay...,"Peeps look really pretty and you say ""hey! why not buy 3 packs"". Then when you eat them sugar is like pouring out of them and they don't really taste good. They are unhealthy and the main ingredient is sugar. I would only buy them for maybe decorations like they have mints on the table in the doctor offices and restaurants and they taste reeaaalllyy bad!"
4,not very great ingredients,"Peeps have been around since forever! I had introduced them to my children today, since its easter, and they were a hit(of course, they're basically sugar). The only bad thing about them is that they have bad ingredients. Bad colors, some weird type of wax for like the eyes, and sugar sugar SUGAR! Once in awile (every easter) is okay for my children to eat them, but otherwise I think peeps are a wonderful idea, and I love how in the markets they have chocolate dipped and chocolate covered peeps. Mmmm, so good..."
1,"Good decorations, awful snacks","Yes, these Peeps have been around forever, but I do not know how they have managed to survive when nowadays there are way healthier, and equally as fun snacks. The main ingredients are sugar, corn syrup (they do not use the ""high fructose"" now), and colorants. Nothing very good for children's health, plus they do NOT taste good. Sure, their colors catch everybody's attention, but most people (children and adults) will put them down after a couple of bites. The one star is for their decoration merits. They indeed cheer up any Easter buffet table."
5,Samsung TAD137JSEB/STD Travel Charger,"This charger was exactly as pictured. I was not sure the end would fit the phone, due to the fact that I had lost the original charger. It fit my T Mobile phone and works very well."
1,Worked one time,"Bumped a big Block Chev over one time to find top dead center and never worked again. The switch is open all the time. Headed for radio shack to get a thumb off/on switch and will make a good remote switch from the scraps of this on. I gave it one star for working one time. We have a trade deficit with China because of substandard quality like this. This every American's fault, including myself, for buying foreign junks and excepting it."
2,Charlie,"To begin with, I bough one of these years ago and It didn't work right out the wrap, I had to fix it before using it. The clamps provided are to bulky and big to fit the small & confined starter fittings of different manufacturers and are not practical to most actual real world applications. I actually end up making my own with basic fittings that will fit different starter's configurations."
3,The tool is adequate,"All in all it worked, Would like to see the clips redesign for easier use on G.M. starters. The clips we difficult to get on the starter."
1,Couln't start an electric razor motor,"This thing can't handle any real amp draw without melting down. Great concept, junk product. I would not buy this product or suggest anyone else do so. You can tell what kind of junk it is right out of the box."
1,no import instructions,"The pathetic instructions provided diagrams for older domestic car applications and nothing for imports. Furthermore, online information is almost nonexistent for this product, making it useless for myself, a honda owner."
2,"Introducing ""Rush Lite""...with half the calories!","Rush try to stay current here (1987) while putting their unique stamp on the music, unfortunately the full-on 80's production values (shimmering keyboards, generic sounding bass (too bad Geddy left his Fender at home) and everything built up from a click track and not live played as a band) turn me off. If the 80's taught us one thing, its that new technology may offer a better signal-to-noise ratio and pinpoint accuracy but it results in sterile, soulless music. I love the spontaneity and energy of their 1970s-early 80s albums the most, but on HYF they really toned it down."
2,Hard to believe it's the same RUSH...,"It's hard to believe that the same magic heavy band that bring 2112, FAREWELL TO KINGS and CARESS OF STEEL are the creators of Hold your fire...In my opinion, this is the most uninspired moment of ALL RUSH career...There some ok songs like force ten or open secrets, but the rest could be associated to lame 80's pop bands! Really love RUSH, but this is not a good rock album!!!"
2,Rush's worst album,"This album is a good example of why the music of the '80s sucked so bad. Even the great band Rush incorporated too much technology and lossed their 'hard rockin' edge. Ditch the keyboards Geddy, and put those hands on the bass where they belong. Thank goodness Rush made an attempt to go back to their roots on each subsequent album by downplaying the keyboards and cranking up the guitars."
2,Disappointing,"What the hell is this?! Sounds like a hard-rock band trying to play synth-pop music! Many songs don't leave a lasting impression because they're much too convoluted and Rush don't allow the melodies to shine. The guitar-playing actually doesn't fit into these cool synth surroundings, and some tracks like ""Open Secrets"" and ""High Water"" are even ruined by Alex' ugly guitar-riffs. ""Tai Shan"" is one of Rush's worst efforts, the music and the trite lyrics remind me of some bad new age noodlings. I like Geddy's beautiful vocal performance on tracks like ""Second Nature"" and ""Mission"", and ""Time stand still"" is a decent song with some more straight-ahead playing. But this album really doesn't catch fire with the exception of a few moments. ""Hold your Fire"" is the statement of a band running out of good song ideas and inspiration in the mid-'80s. If you're interested in '80s-Rush, avoid this album and get some of their early-'80s stuff."
3,"GOOD RUSH, BUT SOMETHING IS MISSING HERE","The songs are good, all of them constructed around few basic chords, with the enphasis going to the arragement of the songs. The result is that the songs all seem alike. But the quality of production (by Peter Collins) is clear."
5,Rush - they are like wine - older and better!,"""hold your fire"" is a rich and powerfull pop-rock album with memorable bass guitar riffs and a lot of synthesisers.compared to ""grace under pressure"" or their other albums it is a true gem and an album most emjoyable from their whole 80's discography."
4,"A very good album, deserves more respect...","I have always liked HYF...it has a personal feel and emotional quality to it that was utterly lacking on its antiseptic predecessor (Power Windows). Peter Collins' co-production was very complimentary here. True, it is an album that relies heavily on sequences, and Alex's guitar solos are shrieky to the point of painful; however, the tunefulness of the song writing and smart lyrics keep things afloat. I was disappointed Rush didn't play ""Prime Mover"" or ""Lock and Key"" on the VT tour, they are among my favorites."
4,"Not typical of previous Rush, but good","I thought this was a very good album, although it's really not like most of their previous music. Rush really has evolved quite a bit over time. I don't think they've made revolutionary changes from album to album, but they have lasted so long and built up such a library that from the beginning to the end there is quite a difference. Personally, I think they peaked with Moving Pictures. This album has more of a pop sound than a hard, complex rock sound. But it's still quite good. For Rush fans, it rounds out their library with some good, softer melodies. For non-Rush fans, this would be an excellent album to start with if you're looking for something that is easy to listen to, with a contemporary sound, and is not ""hard core"" Rush. Quality, enjoyable pop (unlike Roll the Bones, for example.)"
4,A gem from the late 80s,"Like Power Windows this album goes for a sweeping, orchestral sound. The production isn't as sterile, though, and the songwriting is far better. The lyrics have a more personal, less global focus. (""Tai Shan"" makes up for so-so music with some of Peart's most heartfelt writing.) Aside from the bombastic ""Lock & Key"" the songs are all good and often great. This album features the forgotten classic ""High Water"" as well as the AOR hits ""Time Stand Still"" and ""Force Ten"". Hold Your Fire is definitely a highlight of Rush's catalogue and maybe the most mature album they've ever done."
5,The Best of 'New' Rush,"I think this album is great from first song to last. If you listen to nothing but hard rock, I don't recommend this album. If you love songs with great melodies, harmonies and deep lyrics, I recommend this album."
5,Time Stand Still,"I think some Rush fans dismissed this album because they felt the band's sound had become too excessive in a pop format. Much of the material on this release is flowing with the use of keyboards, but the songs flow well as Geddy Lee works his magic. Some might say the band was too experimental and incorporating more keyboards left less time for guitar jams. Maybe there is a little less of that, but certainly not absent. I think most fans will realize how Hold Your Fire is a very strong album once given a chance. The emotion and passion for all things remains within the songs and their observations on life and human interaction continue to be thought-provoking. Rush were getting ready to close a chapter in their music career as the 80's were nearing an end, and as every recording marks a moment in time for this amazing group, their music still stands the test of time."
5,30 year Rush fan.,"I buy everything Rush puts out. Best band ever. I like their 80s synth period the least, but it's still all great. I had only the vinyl of their older stuff and decided to get CDs for ease of use elsewhere."
5,Another Hit From Rush.,"I think Rush is one of the best rock bands ever, even though their stardom was mainly in the 70's, the 80's were good to the band as well. This is one of their best albums of the 80's, even though some people might say, nothing can beat their music from the 70's. To all those who worshipped their music in the 70's you won't be disappointed by this 1987 album.THX,Kris L. CocKayne"
3,3 1/2 stars,"Not a bad album,just not great.the first song on the album is one of my favs!but there are a few keepers.worth buying if you find it."
4,Change In Direction.,"Although Hold Your Fire isn't my favorite Rush album, it still marks the end of the electronic era. They use just as much keyboard as they did on Power Windows but you can hear more guitar in the background starting off from Force Ten. The guitar blends well with the synthesizer and it's a good hard rock track. Time Stands Still is a much lighter track and has a lot of '80s techno in it, although there's still consistent guitar in the background. Rush start to show some change in their sound and it's a step up from Power Windows, which was still good but it sounds a bit dated. Hold Your Fire is just a sign of things to come on Presto. There's several good tracks but my personal favorite is Open Secrets."
3,The Cover's the Best Thing On It,"From looking at the cover and song titles, you'd think this would be a cool, exciting album. There's a brilliant album underneath, but you have to dig past the horrible, cheesy, cheesy, cheesy, CHEESY keyboards! How awful! Also, ""Mission"", which is one of the best Rush songs ever, has the fantastic guitar solo idiotically faded out!! What's the deal with that? ""Second Nature"" has some really, REALLY bad, cliched moments. Terrible sap. Apart from that tune, it's all great, great ideas made almost unlistenable by that horrible poppy 80's garbage arrangement. I'd buy ""A Show of Hands"" before this, the live versions show how good these songs could have been.P.S. This review pretty much applies to Power Windows and half of Grace Under Pressure too."
3,This album is so dang boring!,"Man! This whole thing's made of space-fillers. The only good songs on here are Turn the Page, Force 10 and Time Stand Still; and otherwise, it's all crap! I'm a RUSH fan alright, but this one was WAY too sleepy. If you're lookin' for good RUSH this isn't the best one to listen to!"
2,One of the best's WORST,"Amazingly to me, many (especially younger) Rush fans like this album...so you may like it too, but here's my 2-cents. This CD finally cut the last thread that I held onto as an active Rush fan. (I say ""active"" because I'll always love Rush for their older material, as well as a few newer gems.) I saw Rush for the last of 6 times on the dismal HYF tour. Anyway, with the exception of Time Stand Still (a gem! ), I don't even remember the songs too well anymore. I do recall them feeling very forced, for lack of a better term. As with p/g and Power Windows previously, Rush in the mid/late 80's was in the habit of making neat sounds, embellishments, and fills, but overall really bad songs. When you listen to Permanent Waves, for example, you hear focused, well-crafted and balanced energy coursing through a set of fine songs. Here, the energy is diffuse and the songs just plain bad."
2,Rush - 'Hold Your Fire' (Mercury) 2 1/2 stars,"Review no.124.Originally released in late 1987,this has never been one of my favorite Rush albums,as I'm sure I probably don't stand alone on that.By this point in time,I personally thought that Rush had almost become like a parody of themselves.Also grateful that this faze didn't last within the band.Tunes that are 'okay' are ""Force Ten"",""Time Stands Still"",the rather dark ""Prime Mover"" and ""Lock And Key"".Sorry,but 'Hold...' simply didn't do much for me."
2,TASTELESS,"If you don't know Rush, it's better not start with this one. It has some good songs (""TIME STAND STILL"" and ""PRIME MOVER""), but the general effect is weak, tasteless and boring. It's a ""plastic"" album. Proof of what I'm saying: Not even one of the songs of this album were included in RUSH's triple live album ""DIFFERENT STAGES"", which covers the entire career and phases."
2,Rush's worst album,"Finally, with this CD the Rush-hating critics complaints are legitmate. Cold, mechanical arrangements. Vocals that have become devoid of any emotion. Even a fine set of Peart lyrics can't save this, Rush's worst album, from causing utter irritation. There is one great song (Second Nature), and a couple of decent ones (Mission, Time Stand Still), but for the most part you wonder where the band that wrote Limelight has gone. Rush has classic albums (Perm. Waves, Moving Pictures and Signals), and Rush went on to make the 2nd best album of their career after this (Presto, which strips away the mechanism, and gets back to grade A songwriting), but my advice for this is steer clear."
1,Glih.,"Have you ever thrown a party, invited someone you're not too sure about, and then watched in horror as they and their awful-mannered friends ruin what was once a fun event?This album might best be summed up with one line: ""Alright, who the hell invited the keyboards?""Hemispheres and Farewell to Kings are both definite five-star albums. Head that way first."
1,"Worst Rush CD, Definitely.","I am a huge fan of Rush, but this album is their worst, with Presto being a close second. Forgettable songs, lacks fire like their great 70's and 80's albums. They really do ""hold their fire"". The only decent song on the whole album is Time Stand Still. If you want to get into Rush, DO NOT START WITH THIS ALbum! I can't believe how many good reviews this album got, it is horrific. It's almost as if Rush didn't even try to write great songs on this record."
5,One of Rush's best albums,"This is a good example of why the music of the 80's was so awesome. Bands like Rush put out some of their best and most inspired songs. The keyboards and synthesizers gave each song a more mystical, broader, and awesome sound. Geddy Lee's vocals were more in tune with the music then in the 70's. ""Time Stands Still"", ""Mission"", and ""Force Ten"" are great examples of that. If you want to hear Rush at their best, pick this one up or their Retrospective '81-'87 album."
4,Exceptional album with myriad keyboard textures,"Hold Your Fire is a good album. It was the pinnacle of the their keyboard use that started becoming very visible starting on Grace Under Pressure. Not as as good as Power Windows, but still have some well-written songs on it. ""Tai Shan"" is one of the standouts. The oriental aspects of the music are interesting. ""Open Secrets"" is a great song with smart keyboard and guitar playing. Geddy does a great job singing on it. ""Mission"" is also definitely a keeper along with the interesting ""Prime Mover."" An exceptional album that was the last album they made with myriad keyboard textures. Recommended."
4,Dont hold your fire!,"This is a really classic eighties sounding record. There are plenty of synths and effects are used heavily on the guitars and drums.As Rush albums go its not their best but there are some cracking songs on this - Time stand Still, OPen secrets and prime mover.I love Geddys Bass on this there are some fabulous intricate solos and riffs here - the only thing really wrong is the guitars are too low in the mix - a lot of alex's work goes to waste when the syths are too strong. If the balance could be adjusted it would be really great hence 4 stars."
5,Rush's Best,"I own all of Rush's CDs, and ""Hold Your Fire"" is their best work. It is loaded with Geddy Lee's unparalleled vocals and bass, Alex Lifeson's searing lead guitar, and Neal Peart's thundering drums. ""Force Ten"" and ""Time Stand Still"" are the signature songs from this disc, and each is excellent. Aimee Mann lends her vocal talents on Time Stand Still. ""Second Nature"" and ""Prime Mover"" are good as well. Each cut incorporates Rush's unequaled mix of vocals and insturmentals. Geddy Lee's powerful vocal range is also apparent on all of the tracks on this CD. Each song on this disc is first rate, and this CD is worthy of a place in any music fan's collection."
3,"""B"" Grade Movies","I bought this collection because two of the movies were made in the Philippines. I spent time in the P.I., during the 1950's, about the same time as the filming. What can I say? The movies are ""B"" grade and the acting not the best. I enjoyed seeing scenes in the movies from the Philippines and that's about it."
5,A love affair with art and history as the backdrop,"A Painted Kiss gives you insight on the life of the artist Gustav Klimt through his lover's eyes, Emilie Floge. She first meets the Gustav as a 12 year-old girl. Her parents asked him to give their youngest daughter drawing lessons. Emilie has many emotions running through her mind as a young woman. Her fascination for Gustav does not change and in fact grows into an impassioned love for him. The art world is developing and changing before their eyes. Chapters alternate between a narrative on the people and their poses in each of Klimt's well known paintings; 1890 when Emilie was a young woman in love, as a model and mistress for Gustav Klimt; Emilie as an older woman in 1944 during World War II. Against the backdrop of history, you see how Emilie influenced the art and genius of Gustav Klimt. Outstanding and enjoyable read."
2,NO LOVE LOST HERE,"This imagined relationship between Gustav Klimt and Emilie Floge does not really engage the reader. Rather than presenting a sensual love story, both characters come across as cold and detached. The ""supporting cast"" is equally haughty and unsympathetic.In addition to producing exceptional art, Klimt also produces numerous children by his various ""models"" yet accepts no responsibility for them, and Emilie seems steeped in doubt about eveything from her feelings for Klimt to her ability to produce fashion designs without his input. (Could they be the Viennese version of Brittany and K-Fed??). If you love Klimt's art, as I do, read about the ""real"" man and pass on this fictionalized version of his life. It definitely leaves much to be desired. 1 1/2 stars"
2,What love story?,"It took me forever to finish this book - very slow and tedious at times. I was never convinced of the romance that the story claims to portray. I saw a young, easily influenced girl looking for a father figure (as her own father paid her little attention)and a womanizing, pig of a man (who happened to be a talented artist) that used her to fill some empty spot in his life. I never could see the romantic attraction between the two and felt that Emilie was weak to have tolerated such selfish and insensitive actions as those committed by Klimt. Apparently, this was a real life love story, but I just couldn't understand it."
4,Beautiful,"That sums up this novel. Hickey created a beautifully atmospheric novel about an obscure figure and an artist who is just as obscure to the general, non-art history major public. I'm not going to go into a super detailed review when what I most loved about this book was the atmosphere. The skill with which Hickey was able to create the mood of the period and social subjects was amazing and IMO, shot the book far above drier historical fiction. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, as well as to newcomers to the genre who are intimidated by preconcieved notions. I shall be looking out for more novels by Hickey in the future."
1,trite,"I am surprised by how trite and superficial this book is. the details are shallow and seem like they came from skimming history books. when the lead character talks about sewing it is clear the author is not a seamstress. the conversations between artists are never about the work of painting but are summaries of techniques and opinions. this is nothing like GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. the true struggle of artists in vienna at that time is not engaged by the author. and one more ""spunky "" young woman is boring. show me, don't tell me.BC, Dundee NY"
3,not a lot exciting to write about really,"For those who have seen Kusangai Jun pictorials, she is aver seductive and has this air about her whcih also makes her seem rather arrogant and unattainable. This is what I what I expected when I got this DVD. I was a bit disappointed that she really does not look as good as she does in ther pictorials, and her voice was nothing what I expected.Personal expectations aside, Jun talks a lot, about herself and what she likes. I don't speak a lot of Japanese, but I can make out the context of it all. She does not do anything particularly naughty, this is really a very soft erotica, just a bit of nudity really,and music inthe background.DVD features are almost non-existant, allowing only scene selection, and some previews of other DVDs.Kusanagi Jun fans may want to collect this, but it's not very impressive."
4,A now-classic thriller...,"After reading and then listening to almost all Stephen King's books on cd, tape and now, Audible, I decided to watch the movies and compare. Sometimes they are good and sometimes okay (and even some are bad). I enjoy comparing them with what I read to see how they hold up on the screen.Firestarter was good, holding to the story line as well as can be expected for time limitations and budgets and the special effects of the production time."
4,"Drew Barrymore out did her performce as a Kid in ""E.T.""","An exciting nail biter!..Even with the Special Effects - this was just enjoyable, and great acting by all..Robert Culp was a real Bad Ass!!"
2,Firestarter movie collection,Firestarter is well done and fun. Firestarter 2 is not worth the materials to produce the DVD. Buy 1 and forget the colection!!
3,3 TO 4 STARS!,"First of all, the movie is quite good overall! i wouldn't of expected anything like what it actually was. It's not a horror, scary movie, therefore not a film for someone looking for a scary movie!!!"
1,Firestarter Movie Collection,"Unfortunately, I received this DVD but I did not play it until the 30 days for returns had expired. This DVD does not work. Very disappointed.I had to give it 1 star because the system would not allow me to opt for zero. I cannot give a positive review when the DVD is broken."
4,Original is best,"I got the two movie set because honestly it was cheaper than buying just the first one alone. I decided I would give the 2nd one a try since I really liked the first one. I didn't enjoy the second movie much at all, although the first one was still just as good as I remembered."
2,"First movie ok, Second movie waste","The first movie was cheesy. It had some good parts. Don't even waste your time on the second movie. Whoever wrote it should be shot. They did not keep the same story line. It is supposed to take place after the first movie when the girl is older, but they did a really crappy job by mixing up what happened (how the father died, how the girl was kept captive and made to use her powers, bringing people back to life that you know died, etc.) It was just a really really bad movie that seemed like it would never end. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, they out did themselves by doing something else ridiculous. It's obvious that the writer didn't do his homework.The only reason I rated this two stars was for the first movie, the second movie didn't even deserve a half star."
4,it works,"Got the job done for me. Confirmed I was leaking fuel pressure after shutting off the engine (causing hard starting) and allowed me to determine where it was going, which turned out to be the last place I would have expected. It cost half what the dealer's diagnosis did, who mis-diagnosed the problem. Did not have the problem of leakage around the pressure release button that another reviewer mentioned. However, if you use the T hose adapter I'd recommend putting a wrench on the fitting to make sure the two brass parts are tightly screwed together before using it. I had a bit of a leak from there that disappeared once I cranked up the tightness a turn or so. If you use the T fitting take a look at it and you'll understand what I'm talking about."
3,"Works, but...","As some other reviewers mentioned, the ""Ford"" adapter also gave me trouble.The first time I used it, I needed to use a wrench to tighten the ""Ford"" adapterenough to get a reading. When I needed to use it a year later, I still needed to tighten it as I wasn't getting any reading. Then the Ford valve broke off inside the adapter while I was tightening on it and gas spewed until I could shut down the engine. The adapter was also ruined because of the broken valve stem inside it. My email to Actron customer service did not result in any useful response. ""You shouldn't have to tighten the adapter with anything but your fingers"" or something like that. I've since bought a Harbor Freight model and it doesn't need a pliers/vise grip/wrench to work, and it cost half the Actron unit."
4,"Brass not plastic, but had trouble reading Ford",Kit can read many car types but we had trouble reading a Ford. With the hose fitting put on hand tight the gauge did not read. Had to back it off until it leaked then tighten only until leak stopped. Looks like the hose trip pin is too long and shuts off the adapter check valve. Still the best kit for the money.
4,works well,I was pleasantly surprised with the product it does have a plastic lens but so does my blue point radiator pressure tester just don't drop on face. came with nice pouch for storage and all the needed fittings for most makes. The pressure relief hose is very long and when used for the first time was accurate enough to diagnose faulty fuel pump.
3,Quality product for the price but gauge seems cheap.,"This fuel pressure gauge is a good buy for the price, comes with numerous adapters for a well rounded application for most vehicles. my only complaint is the gauge seems quite cheap but that being said i have not had one problem with the set at all and its helped me more then once so i would definitely recommend this for a home hobbyist or a professional tech looking for an affordable fuel pressure set. also comes with a nice bag case type thing for storage."
4,Good quality kit,"Comes with everything you need to get the job done (provided it has the right adaptors for your car). Decent quality, well thought out kit.Only thing I wished was that it came with a blow moulded case to store the bits in.It does include a storage bag, but this is relatively impractical."
3,Actron CP7838 Fuel Pressure Tester,"The Actron CP7838 fuel pressure tester has limited usage but when you need it,you need it. Product worked fine but due to my car's fuel system it was difficult toinstall the fittings to get a fuel pressure measurement."
3,Wrong tool for Ford Flex Fuel engine,"The tool appears to be of average quality. However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine. This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have."
4,Worked Fine,"I have only used this tool once since I bought it, on Chevy with a Shrader valve connection and had no leaks or other issues with the tester. Wish the case was bigger."
5,More than adequate for the serious home mechanic,Actron seems to have changed the storage bag for this product. I could probably get 2 gauges + acc into the bag I got and there is a clear window on the bag so you can see what's inside.I have several Actron test products and they are far superior to the junk you find in the chain auto parts stores. No flimsy plastic parts that break off at the slightest provocation.P.S. If you have an import you can get 3 additional banjo adapters sold directly by Actron. I found 2 of them here on Amazon. And they don't gouge you on the accessories price like many other manufacturers.
3,Good Fuel Pressure Tester for the Money but needs Ford Adapter,"As far as value it is a good gauge and has a nice long hose. The Ford adapter did not fit the fuel rail on a 2001 Ford Explorer 4.0L. It did not depress the schrader all the way. I even tried using thinner washers on the hose coupler. The adapter pin does not stick out all the way. But go to NAPA and buy the Ford extension hose and hook it up to the gauges hose and your set. Good luck even connecting to the rail between the coil pack without it. I did manage to try the adapter if your wondering, not easy and it doesn't work anyway. Hope this helps someone who thinks it doesn't work on their 4.0L."
4,Good value...,"The ONLY fuel pressure tester on the market with a long hose.All others have a short hose leaving you hunched over to read the gauge.With ALL the extra adapters you will ever need, makes this one the winner."
4,Quality Product,"Professional level, well made product that does exactly what it should, give solid performance. Wide assortment of adapters is very useful if you work on more than one car. Only real negative is minor. Storage pouch is a little small. Tough to get gauge and all the accessories into it. No big deal."
5,Good entry level gauge,This same gauge is very good for the price. It will connect to any car with a schrader valve or a rubber hose connection. It will also connect to GM TBI fuel lines and some hondas and acuras with a banjo bolt connection.(Many of the users reviewing this product do not know how to properly use it. Do not tighten the ford adapter with a wrench or the main fitting with pliers and keep the seals lubricated and the seals will last.)
3,fuel pressure tester,The item came on time & it was the item that I ordered. I had a hard time connecting the fitting to the truck because of wires in the way if it had a 45 degree fitting or a 90 degree fitting it would have been no problem I thought I had it hooked up started the truck & looked under the hood to find gas gushing out went ahead & hooked the fitting on & the gauge worked as it should but the release valve leaks. Other than that it did what it was suppose to do.
1,Liberal Intolerance?,"The title of this work indicates that Mr. Oliphant is suffering from a severe double-standard. Seeing that he has two (one for his friends - tolerance is good; and one for his enemies - ""I will not tolerate a logical point of view and will denegrate the holders thereof""), one can hardly trust his bleary point of view. It is typical of a liberal to insist on a cordial discourse and then to slander his opponent."
3,okay dance movie,"The dancing is great and the dance scenes are wonderful. However,this has the tiring story of Michael Flatley and his making of a dance production. It is better to get Lord of the Dance and Riverdance without the commentary of Celtic Tiger."
4,Celtic Toe Tapper,"If you like, Celtic music or you enjoyed Riverdance then this DVD is for you. Essentially three stories on one DVD its great value for money. For those serious addicts like me this DVD has kept us going until the new show Celtic Tiger hits the road, which should be anytime soon....Its fascinating to watch how the delightful Lord of the Dance evolved into Feet of Flames and then in Gold see what influenced Michael and watch that all important Eurovision Song Contest where the dancers were the half time act that stole the whole show...yes!"
3,The Michael Flatley Collection (Lord of the Dance/Feet of Flames/Michael Flatley Gold),Good overall DVD. The double-sided DVD offers 3 different performances at a great price.
5,Exciting modern Celtic entertainment!,This is more than a dance show...it has a story and an attention to excellence and detail that makes it a thrill to watch!
5,"Flatley, the most fantastic dancer in the world!","I purchased this DVD on a whim. I never heard of Michael Flatley before.Well, the man is astounding....He single handedly changed the look of the stilted, boring, something to be ashamed of Irish heritage dancing!The world and especially Ireland owe him the greatest debt.For those that complain that he is more Hollywood than Ireland: Yes baby, isn't that great!He breathed life into the old Irish jig, the jig that the Irish were ashamed to say they can dance!Purchase the DVD, you will not be sorry...."
5,Great,"Excellent dvd. This one was just as good as when I had it on tape. Being a dance major myself, I love Michael Flatley's work. It's great for anyone who likes dance."
4,"Exciting, but the DVD Itself has some problems","I love Irish Dance, and while I detest Flatly personally, he puts on quite a show. The show itself is 5 stars. The DVD however, when they recorded the sound onto the DVD, something must have gone wrong because during Feet of Flames, the sound fluxuates, it gets louder when the crowd cheers, but the actual show parts are softer."
3,Not exactly riverdance,"My daughters became fascinated with Riverdance (the best of DVD) and with Michael Flately. While the DVD is a good bargain since it is three videos in one, my kids were not a thrilled with it as I had hope they might be. The music is not as catchy, nor is the dance as visually appealing, at least to children anyway. The look is a bit more like modern-dance. If you are a Michael Flately fan, there is a nice personal interview with him, and of course he is featured a great deal since it is his show. But if you are more of a Riverdance fan, I would recommend some of the older shows featuring him, rather than this DVD... it's not exactly Riverdance."
1,Poor videography,"Although the dancing is excellent, the disgustingly unprofessional videography makes this recording impossible to enjoy it. There are few shot blocks longer than 4 or 5 seconds, with some of them as short as 1 second. At that rate of change, there is simply no way to focus on, much less comprehend, the complex choreography happening. It's as if the video editing crew has taken over the performance and made it their act, not the dancers'. Sometimes I am even forced to watch the progress of Flatley's nostrils roaring across the stage.I bought Feet of Flames and Lord of the Dance. Both of them are identical shows, but with different audiences. I ended up so frustrated watching what could have been a beautiful, engaging presentation, that I fried the DVD in the microwave.Videographers are mostly unimportant to an art. Their job is to simply record what's going on without distraction. These guys apparently don't have a clue what their job is supposed to be."
3,repeat performances,This is a good dvd but the performances seem to be pretty much the same. Same routines in both Lord of The Dance and Feet of Flames. Good quality tho.
4,"Great dancing, some repetition",There is some duplication of one show in the other. Great dancing/music as usual.
2,Flatley,This DVD comes in Flatley... or should I say flat. He's a genious but once out of the Riverdance routines he just misses tha mark.
1,Not happy,I can't play the DVD here in Australia and I have returned it to be replaced. Thank you in anticipation of your assistance. Mavis Host.
5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent",I purchased this for my sister. Excellent was the word she repeated over and over again! She's watched about 2 hours of the DVD and still has 3 more hours of dance performance to enjoy. She is one happy lady
4,Irish in London,"This is a good quality filming of the London show. The dancers, costumes and the leads are great and the show itself has put a lot of effort in making the whole spectacular. The mixture of dance, entertainment and Irish song makes the too long show time more bearable and very nice. They make you get the value for your money."
3,The Michael Flatley Collection (Lord of the Dance/...,Not as good as I had hoped it would be. Disappointed with seeing the same thing over again in each program. Also not the best video quality.
4,Music and Rythm!!!,"I was heartbroken when my then young son ruined my video tape of Lord of the Dance a few years ago. But I am thrilled now that I have the DVD! All the songs and tap come back so easily. I do wish that there were not so many quick cuts in each dance number, but the editing is tight so you don't loose any of what is going on. The music is fantastic, and the dancing leaves nothing to be desired. Great for all ages, the adults love the subtleties in the rythms, and the kids all love the lights, music and motion."
4,very pleased,I was very pleased with Michael Flatley. I will buy again.The Michael Flatley Collection (Lord of the Dance/Feet of Flames/Michael Flatley Gold)
4,Scholarly lite,"Is it good? Oh, it's good. Gets cumbersome in places but the author maintains a lighthearted and rather even-handed tone. The author occasionally wanders dangerously into dull academese, but then rescues the prose with brilliant anecdotes. Don't expect any hard data - read and enjoy the hundreds of snapshots depicting a life long gone.As for content: It's positively shocking to read about the social disapproval that came simply with eating before lunch, eating too much, and eating the wrong foods. It horrifies a modern reader to see the tremendous and baseless sacerdotal interference in nutrition throughout the Middle Ages. Ponder the role of churchmen who feel they had nothing better to do than offer proscriptions on how, what, and when to eat.And then ponder how our generation has outdone even them in associating guilt and shame with the love of food..."
3,"Full of information, but thick reading","I thought this would be a great source of information on the topic, and it is. It's just rather thickly written. So take your time with it."
5,A Cumbersome Read,"I originally gave this a 5 star rating (and then couldn't go back and change it to a 3 star rating) based on the overwhelming and obvious amount of research that went into preparing the book. The book however, is misleading in that it is a SCHOLARLY written text on medieval foods and customs, all of which require the reader to wade through tons and tons of short clips of religious beliefs associated with food, as well as tons and tons of short clips of bibical quotes regarding food and food taking. This might be all well and good if the writing flowed, but it doesn't. The content is disjointed and extremely cumbersome to read, and I finally gave up. The subject matter caught my interest and I was sadly disappointed - the mistake was mine, and an expensive one at that."
2,Need to cut out,"I'm not sure why the description says ""easy to remove"" clothes, because I had to cut everything except the dolls out. Maybe they meant easy to remove from the dolls, or maybe I just got a bad lot! But I had no idea I was going to have to cut everything out in order to use it! My hand is hurting! It's a cute set but also a little flimsy (while punching out the dolls a couple of them tore on the tabs)."
4,Little House Paper Dolls,First time purchase for the classroom center...big hit! I will purchase this in the future. I would recommend this book.
5,Beautiful Set of Paper Dolls,"We recently purchased this set for a family friend on her sixth birthday - she LOVES Little House on the Prairie, so this was a perfect fit.My daughters also have this set of paper dolls. My only complaint would be that the clothes need to be CUT out (the dolls punch out) - makes for a bit more work for Mom!"
5,I did receive this one after quite a while and the product is very nice.,"This book finally came and it is a very nice book. Something got all messed up so it took a while to get herebut once it did I am very happy to have it, and it is a beautiful paper doll. Thanks."
3,An emotionally charged scathing indictment of Catholicism,"Crux Ansata is a sometimes scholarly, sometimes emotional indictment of the Roman Catholic Church. Drawing on theological history, Wells builds a case against the Church for various reasons, predominantly political. All of this leads up to a final chapter entitled, ""Why Do We Not Bomb Rome?"" It is the work of a man passionately crusading against his own conceptions of ignorance, and while convincing at times, I couldn't help but wonder while reading it, ""What did the nuns do to him""? Written towards the end of Wells's career when he became exceedingly bitter and critical of modern society."
5,great CD!,"This album is masterfully produced.Crisp and clean. Dennis' guitar playing,singing and songwriting really shine.I saw him in concert recently in Boulderand he blew me away. An incredible talent.Amazon.com should feature his cd's a littlemore prominitely. He ranks up therewith the best."
4,My MSU Fan loves this!,"I'm a skeptic with every online purchase, but I was pleasantly surprised. My future MSU student truly loves his new watch."
5,Sink Mats,These are the best mats I have owned. They protect anything breakable and they don't get slimy from laying in the sink. I had other ones that were disgusting because they got slimy and smelly.
3,Material not as expected.,"The material is not flexible enough for the sink, does not adapt to shape of the sink and stays like wrinkle."
4,Good Old Jackie!,"By far one of his greatest films i have seen. Not far behind Snake in the Eagles shadow. The action in this one is top notch, and some good humor as well, but not corny like many of his new movies. I could watch these types of movies all day. It's got it all, including a long, amazing final battle with some of the most impressive styles you'll see. A must have for any jackie chan fan, or i should say any martial arts fan."
2,"Nice idea, wish it worked...","I bought this to remove some stripped screws. It removed two out of four, and loosened one enough to grab it with Vise grips. No go on the fourth.I worry about using this regularly, as this magnetic bit holds the ground out remnants of the screws. Unless you clean it, when it is reversed it could leave these bits of metal inside your drill's chuck.I'd return it, but won't because I used it."
2,disappointing,"wanted it to work, needed it to work, did a little.... but mostly frustrating!!!!Drillout - Screw Remover Kit 2 Piece #6 #14"
2,"Bought 2, one died after about a year and a half","I bought 2 of these units, thought it would be cool to have one upstairs and one in the basement since when I am down there it is hard to hear the door bell. Anyways, the units have a scratchy sound at best and if someone hits the doorbell quickly, like kids often do, it messes up the signal. Sometime if you hit it twice really quickly it will cancel the signal. My biggest complaint though is that one of the units completely died after about 1.5 years of use."
1,It is actually ZERO stars as it was never received.,"Never received item. Searched all over Amazon and there does not appear to be an icon or anything else to click on to register complaint for third party purchases. Will never again purchase from one of Amazons ""partners"". I'm guessing Amazon makes it hard to dig through their clutter to find customer ""service"" and people will give up on low dollar items. Amazon wants their cut but does not assist with any complaints. If they say it was delivered you do not have any way of disputing. Of course you are billed promptly."
3,Red00,I can't believe this cost $350. The house is not colorful and doesn't resemble the pictures. The stickers that were included will fall off in the first rain. Overall though my kids love going in and out of their own house. But there is nothing to do inside. The chalkboard is not real either. Costs lots of money for what you get. My kids can use their imagination in a cardboard box.
4,Big Fun!,This was a Christmas gift for my 1 1/2 year old. It is cold so he hasn't really had a chance to play in it much. My only problem is the plastic pieces for the windows were broke when we started putting it together. Other than that it's great.
1,Amazon Sucks,"This came with No instructions, they dropped the price $50.00 the day after I ordered. Did not have the Stickers or the Basketball Net. And now I have no way of getting ahold of someone to correct the issues.They Should Rot for this."
2,Stickers and color don't last outdoors - keep inside for lasting value,"This appears to be a really fun outdoor toy, and it does have a lot of play value. However, it is not overly durable if you use it as an outdoor toy. The stickers that come with the playhouse quickly peeled off within a few months of play. This was disappointing, because they really added to the decor of the playhouse. The plastic shutters ended up cracking and one shutter fell off...plus the color of the shutters turned very yellow and foggy over time. The basketball netting also did not last and frayed very quickly. My children (3 & 5) loved the store side of the house, and would hand out food to mom and dad all day long. They also enjoyed using the gasoline pump to fuel their bicycles and john deere tractors. The creativity of the toy is fun, but I would recommend keeping this indoors to maintain the appearance of the playhouse. I would also forego using the stickers if you are going to put the playhouse outside."
2,Quite good but...,"OK, the book is not that bad, it explains the theory clearly BUT it is ""applied"" and there is no solutions to the exercise books in the authors webpage (although they do include the data sets for the exercises). I know it's common nowadays to edit books with math exercises without a solutions manual (or at least a pdf file online) but it doesn't change anything.So yes, it's a good book to read, but how will you be sure you understood what you've read if you can practice it?"
3,An Elementary Book,"The book is an introduction to time series and covers ARMA, VAR Unit roots and Basic Cointegration, is a good book for people that want learn time series quickly, the book has some elementary theory of time series and many examples and exercises, the computacional problems needs some of RATS ...the book describes time series without advanced mathematics."
4,A Practical Book,"Starting with the Difference Equations (Ch 1), Enders will walk you through practical methods involved in time series.This is a good introductory book in time series. But, it has some practical aspects. For example, in Chapter 3, the yen/dollar exchange rate model is cited, indicating non-random walk behavior in this exchange market so that an efficient market hypothesis may not apply here. Then the business cycles are discussed. As the cycles in exchange markets are what some technical traders look for, an approach like this is valuable to working analysts."
4,sailor moon novel 1,if you want to know what the book is about and not the the complants read here.I think this book is great.it tells you how a normal middle school girl Serena Tuskino(japanese Usagi Tuskino) meets a talk ing cat Luna. (not the first time srena meets)and how serena is given here powers tobe come sailor moon. and haves to save her friend Molly from a monster.And the book also includes a book episode not in the tv show.
4,Sarah,"this book is good, because you read about the shows DiC Did not make. stays with japnese plot. But you need see show, to them tranform and here thier voices"
3,This Book is ok,"This book is ok for people who just started watching Sailormoon. If your an old SM fan, I recomend the Mangas!"
1,"Yuck. Horrible, horrible, horrible.","I have heard that Stuart Levy is not a very big fan of Sailor Moon, and this has proven it for me. He seems to be rather out of touch with the show, and the writing style, to me seems awkward and stiff. It mainly focuses on the DiC dub, but adds two missing episodes which were never aired in the US. I found it rather short, and uninteresting. It defenitely shouldn't be rated Young Adults, (too short a book) but the things Mr.Levy mentions (Bloomingdale's, Miami Vice, Interveiw with the Vampire, Monteblanc) a young child may not have seen to understand. I'd advise Sailor Moon fans to stick to reading the manga's, they're much more interesting."
1,The fake sailor moon,"Another horrible american production of sailor moon. God! Come on already! Why most every anime be destroyed by being americanized? Why is it sooo wrong for there to be Japanese culture since after all, it is from Japan! This book was terrible! Every time I read the name Serena, I cringed. What's wrong with the name Usagi? So what if it doesn't sound American? Why is that so bad? And second of all the word scouts make me cringe. It's not scouts, they're not girl scouts..., it's senshi, sailor soilders... soilders! You want to read a real sailor moon book? then go buy the real Japanese manga, so what if you can't read it, there are translations on the internet!"
1,ascout is born and this book should have never been,I read this book and was so upset with what I was reading this book summarized the english sailor moon series and left out parts of what was in english verison. To cut out the japanesse is one thing but to cut out both jap and american is awful. I would be better for you to just buy the manga. It tells in more detail the story and is for an older group than this book.
1,Agree with 90% of reviews,"I am a newbie to Sailor Moon and wanted to read what I missed from earlier seasons. I bought both magna and this book, what a bomb! Get the MIXX versions, I know they're more money, but they fill in everything that going on. These DiC books are so twisted in their stories, I get enough of that from the liberal media!"
1,Is it possible to give a book a minus rating?,"I mean, come on. This isn't Sailormoon. This is some incredibly horrible mutilation of it. YICK. People, get the original manga and look up translations if you must, but do NOT support Mixx's ruining of a good manga. -_-;"
3,Sailor Moon,"My first question is, why didn't the cover artist show the full picture of Serena and Tuxedo Mask? Until I saw the full picture somwhere, I was very curious as to what the black and white hand-looking thing on the edge of the picture was. I think the cover could have been done better.Also, I have to say that in this series, Serena and everyone else practically moved to the U.S. How many Japanese girls listen to *NSYNC? I'm sure some do, but still.Serena occasionally saying ""Oh my God!"" got on my nerves, too. I personally don't care to say that myself, although some people may not agree.Instead of this book, I would've recommend the comic book series, which is more accurate and entertaining, but I found it to be disgustingly trashy. Parents of younger, or protected children will be sorry they ever let their kid read those books!Myself, I'm going to try the popular, and what I've heard to be clean, manga series Tokyo Mew Mew."
3,non-picky fan book,it was okay.I wanted it to flow more with the anime series.the tv show is better (that's a big compliment from me;a bookworm.).
2,Mixx Misjudges,"This would be a good book for an 8-year-old. However, if you're a dedicated, true fan, don't waste your money. I was excited to see that Mixx was putting out a novel series about my favorite anime, but I soon found that it was a sorry stab (cough, cough, DiC) at making the American population understand and relate to Sailor Moon. Usagi (Serena, for the dubbies) has never cared how many pairs of CK jeans she has or where her boyfriend buys his sunglasses. Sailor Moon is a wonderful story, Usagi is a wonderful character, and they make her out to be shallow and superficial. Still, I have to give them a couple of stars for trying to get America more interested in our favorite heroine. Too bad they did it so poorly."
2,What Happened!?,"Okay,Here is my explanations of these stories,since i own the first three and read them.What Happened,there was no N'snyc, Jennifer Lopez,Backstreet Boys or any of that Kind on the T.V. Series so why put them in the book if it was based on the Series, it made we roll my eyes eveytime they mentioned that stuff.The books to me were okay besides what i mentioned and i also think they are for eight year olds,not that good for really good fans.I gave it two stars one for getting most of it right the other for trying."
1,Should have been better,"This book was awful. The one star it gets is for being about Sailor Moon and having the ""missing"" episode. All other aspects made it hard to even turn the page. I don't know how I made it to the end."
1,BURN IT!,"Oh my god, this is soooo horrible! Ok, first of all, it's completely DiC-ed up. I don't see why anyone would want to read this or watch the dub. There is only one Sailormoon! This is so Americanized. It was disgustingly annoying how they changed the names to American ones, and mentioned all these American bands and clothes brands.....Auuuuggghhhhh! Burn this book! Please, please get the manga. It is sooooooo much better. Not to mention the original!"
1,There's no way to go under one?,I cannot believe this! This is a horrible excuse for ANYTHING relating to sailor moon! It isn't even the original story and I personally hated it! Any americanized-only person- be my guest! But I must warn you- I've read the mangas and you had better stick with them... Never will I ever read another SM book written by an American...
2,woah now,"I loved this when I was 9. I mean, I ate this up! Couldn't put down the entire set of these books. Heck, I even got them lined up on my shelf to this day next to the entire manga collection. But now, at the ripe old age of 21, I realized the error of my ways. This tripe was made for little American girls, who don't know the first thing about how truly wonderful the original version of the Sailor Moon series is. Sure, read this if you are a die-hard fan and you gobble up anything to do with our favorite ladies. But for the love of god, don't take this seriously and DON'T consider this as the ""true"" Sailor Moon."
1,WRONG Item,"The advertised blanket is NOT what came in the mail! The item I received is a cheap and hideous version of ""leopard"" print (if you can even call it that!) and is vertically striped with dark brown and light brown. The ""leopard"" prints are actually random black splotches randomly thrown over the blanket and it doesn't even begin to resemble leopard print.Do NOT waste the money on this item because you will not get what you paid for!"
3,Not bad....,"Pretty good stuff here, fairly well done, but nothing to warrant a repeat listen. Force Ten sounds a lot better on Different Stages (Import) and this album doesn't have that energy by comparison."
2,concert alright not great but the worst live cd maybe...,just on a note I bought a used cd from a crazypetlady on amazon they claimed that its in excellent condition but when I recieved the cd it has scratches and markings on it beware of the crazypetlady.. buyer beware!!!!!
2,Not impressed...,"I bought this for my brother for a gift. When I received the ax head was scratched up and the varnish was coming off handle. I didn't return it because it was only a few days before Christmas. He was happy with it but if I were going to buy another, I would get it from a different source."
5,Worth every penny!!!!,"I found these shoes in black in the clearance section of an outdoors store. There were only two pairs left and they were in my size. Even at 60% off, I thought that they were too expensive until I tried them on. They are without a doubt, the most comfortable shoes I have ever had on my feet. I snatched up both pairs and would have been happy to pay full price for that level of comfort. They are even more comfortable than tennis shoes. They are highly recommended, and I can't wait to get a pair of the professionl ones for work."
4,...and please remember to stiff your waiter,"Oh the fun you'll have and stories you'll tell. Here's a book written by an insider (viz. waiter) about how to get free meals from restaurants. By 'free' of course, I mean 'stolen', but what's the difference? Particularly charming is the section on getting the whole family involved--using your children as pawns in a gambit to acquire that elusive free Bloomin' Onion. A fun read, but I don't have the balls or desire to go to jail to actually do this stuff."
5,Excellent Book / Excellent Author,"I love this book!! This is an excellent book on how to beat a check, and also a little ""beating the world around you"" if you read into it properly! I put it right up there with gaslighting! I also met the author once...great mind/great person! Would recommend 100%!! Happy reading!"
3,The Saints Revealed in Holy Cards,"The book is beautiful, and the holy cards reproduced from the collection of Father Eugene Carrella are exquisite. What I expected is a book about the art of holy cards; this book is not that. It is hagiography illustrated with lovely holy cards.The research is not extensive, and the bibliography, especially the websites listed, seems dishonest. (None of the three websites has anything to do with holy cards.)A book about the history of the art and calligraphy of holy cards and Catholic devotional materials has yet to be written. If you love holy cards, you will love the beauty - not the scholarship - of this book."
3,Christmas gift...,"for my husband. Not what I expected. The description of this book I found to be somewhat lacking...misleading. The colors are beautiful, but I was hoping these actual ""cards"" could be used as bookmarks or to be carried on him.Also, unfortunately, the print is too small for him so he's not reading. I learned the hard way...but learned non-the-less. I would caution those that may be considering."
4,Cyber punk and Marvel cross over?,"This book was done by renowned manga artist Tsutomu Mihei, and he has delivered an excellent and beautiful piece in his own twisted style. True, the story is thin and there is very little text to read, and yes Wolverine is portrayed as lanky- but if you're a fan of BLAME! or Tsutomu's other work, Noise, Or you just enjoy dark stylized artwork- you'll love this book as much as I."
3,A little pointless,"This book is really fast paced, actually it's so fast paced you don't even have time to enjoy what's going on. It seems like a bad excuse to print a manga style wolverine story. It has no relevance to the character nor the x-men story line. Great art though, I really like the post apocalyptic atmosphere and the pale wolverine look. Other than that feel free to skip this one."
3,Disappointing Art,"The story itself was ok but the artwork made it hard to read as it was very busy and stylized. I was not overly impressed, I would seriously think twice before I would buy it again."
5,"Finally, the truth is told!","The naturists who hang out at Cap d'Agde, though they are in the majority, don't want anyone to know what a haven for swingers (or libertines, as the author Velton puts it) that The Naked City is. Cap d'Agde has something for everyone and this travel guide certainly gives everyone the exact info they need to find their pleasures, whether those pleasures are lurid or benign family fun. The section advising single men made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it highly even if you are only an armchair traveler."
4,Awesome disc - a Winwood Classic!,"Forget about all of the negative comments appearing here, this is one great collection of music! Of course it is keyboard heavy, but that's what Steve Winwood does best!The title track is just incredible and ""While You see a Chance,"" one of the most positive set of lyrics penned.Although these two tracks are undoubtedly the standouts, ""Dust"", ""Slowdown Sundown"" and ""Second Hand Woman"" are also very strong.If there is a weak track on this disc, it would have to be ""Night Train"", but even saying that is stretching things. In fact, its' very reminiscent of Warren Zevon's ""Nighttime in the Switching Yard"" and Bruce Cockburn's same titled track from his ""The Charity of Night"" release.All in all, a solid set from Steve Winwood that certainly holds its own alongside ""Refugees of the Heart"" and ""Roll With It""."
2,"Great Album, Weak Reissue","I buy a ton of music - a lot still on CD - and I am a big fan of the deluxe remastered and repackaged format. Unfortunately this is one of the weakest I've encountered. The remaster of the album itself is solid and sounds great. The liner notes are weak; they seem almost incomplete and include lyrics for only some songs (not Sundown, Slowdown). The jewel pack has a Deluxe band around it and I think it's a cheesy sticker! Feels bootleg. And the extras are some on the weakest I've encountered. Alternate versions of two of the weaker songs and an interview??? In retrospect the single remastered original disc would have been fine. Really a missed opportunity as this was a strange and exciting time in Winwood's career."
4,A delightful romp with a feisty heroine.,"I selecteed this book by virture of recommends by Amazon, in the section if you liked this book, you will like..I read Carolyn Hart, Sharyn McCrumb, and light mysteries. Dianne Day wove an interesting plot, and introduced me to an unusual young woman sleuth, livng in 1905 San Francisco. I look forward to other romps with Freemont Jones."
4,great airplane reading,"Fremont Jones is a refreshingly spirited young woman who becomes involved in solving two mysteries in turn of the century San Francisco. This book is a lot of fun to read; it's well written with snappy, entertaining dialogue. I thought it fell apart a bit at the end, though. And, as might be expected, in trying to include two completely disparate mysteries in one novel, both of them end up getting short-changed. I wonder why she didn't just make it into two novels--either of them would have been sufficient if she had gone more deeply into the characters involved. Great read, though--very absorbing, and goes by quickly."
4,Refreshing and Addictive,"How refreshing to have a strong female protagonist going against convention. Addictive from page one to page 257. The book caught my eye because it takes place in turn of the centruy San Francisco--so nice to have a novel set so close to home. The characters are engaging, and the hint of romance makes it all the more delicious."
4,Plenty of twists,"This was the first book by Dianne Day I read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The early 20th century makes for delightful reading. I highly recommend this book to people who shy away from mysteries. This will change your mind."
1,"A terrible, gross, creepy book.",I was very disappointed with this book. It was one of the creepiest books it has been my misfortune to read. If you don't want to be grossed out by a subplot about a child being tortured do not read this book.
4,Good Fill Light,"Easy to attach and use. I haven't learned all the features but right out of the box, and set to auto mode, the flash works great. It gives out an even fill light and the model light is good for low light conditions. Nice quality and is simple to put on or take off."
1,Bad customer service. Never responded to my email,"I purchased this ring flash and after a few uses, I mean like 7 uses one of the lights burned out or something. All I know that is not working. I contacted the seller via email and I copied Amazon on my email explaining the problem. The seller did not responde to my email and when I contacted them via telephone they told me they would call me back. They never did. They don't stand behind their products they sell even if it wasn't the sellers fault I reached to them So they could help me and get information about the warranty, they didn't even bother to call me back. I have purchased so many products from Amazon and I have never had a problem until I came across this seller. be aware!!!"
5,amazing images,"I specialize in plant photography that I use in lectures and books, and bought this flash to compliment my Nikon D200 with 105 mm macro lens. The first day I used it I was hooked. It allows me to take the most incredible extreme macro photographs of flowers, seeds, insects, mosses,and anything else with a lot of complex detail. I do wish that the hot shoe was metal and not plastic, but so far I have not had a problem with it breaking (I remove it gingerly). The response from audiences has been overwhelmingly positive and I only wish I had bought this ring flash earlier."
2,Its great when its working but doesn't last long...,"It was working excellent with my Nikon D80 for nearly 2 years (not quite 2 years yet). I used it for taking clinical photos of my patients. I only use it for about 1 to 2 times a week, not really that often. Today, the right side of the tube die on me and didn't flash. I checked and make sure it didn't fire not because I accidentally switch that side off. I am going to send it back to Sigma and see what's the estimate of fixing it... It isn't very durable for only lasting less than 2 years..."
5,"It is very gothic, mystical and nice with sexual arrousle.",The movie is set in ancient times when the is still magic sorcery. The creatures and architexture is very gothic. Dark Schnider a 4oo year old sorcierer is brought back to save the earth from the god of distruction. He was evil but he was brought back in a young and inocent loving boy and since Dark Schnider is part of him he becomes more loving and good.
4,zoom,great product for the price...although the price is only 179 with free shipping at www.zzsounds.com and nearly EVERY other outlet i've seen besides this. it's done the job for me so far and i'd definetly recommend it to anyone starting out who needs something for basic home recording/demos.
3,safety tape,"good anti slip, but does not stick well on older wooden outside porch stairs, but if you use a 3m spray it sticks real good, this tape is worth the money, priced ok. cheaper than local hardware stores"
2,Expected More from This Product!,"I purchased this approx. 4-5 months ago purely because a lot of the reviews stated that it was very durable, strong and lasted longer than most others. It is very strong and does ""work"" but I have had some issues with it! You have to make sure where you are adhering it is COMPLETELY dirt free or it will soon come up. It stayed on some of my porch steps and not others and when adhering we had some issues getting it to stay on some steps. It has lasted but is starting to crack and tear on some steps. I would say it was worth the money and since you get 60 feet adding more in places is no hassle, I just expected more from this product!"
3,Completely useless since it was too small for even a 6 year old,"I ordered this for my 11yr old, but it would not fit. My 6yr old daughter could not fit this either. I tried contacting the seller and never got a response. Ended up throwing away money on this. It looked okay, but will never know how durable it would have been. I wish the company would have responded and I REALLY wish I could've gotten my money back. We ended up winding a rubber band on top of a black knit cap to make it look like a bun. Looked great and it was free!"
4,weird but fun,"I bought this to go with an inflatable sumo costume. It truly made the outfit, but it was a little strange. It was like waring a small toboggan and gave a weird hair line but it wasn't too expensive and for the price did just what we needed it to do."
2,Disappointing.,"I was very disappointed about this book. I find it poorly organized and lacking in content. It basicly consists of very long lists of items, and each item occupying approximately one line, and containing only very little description, and there are very few photos. Everyone who has tried knows that evaluating antiques is very tricky, and even from detailed descriptions and pictures it can be close to impossible. These lists are rather useless unless accompanied by lots of details. Perhaps for very specific items, i.e. china, glass, etc. it could be useful, but I think it has very limited use for furniture."
2,Didn't work for me,"Didn't work for me. I guess I was expecting something that would help me figure out if what I had inherited was worth anything. It is more geared to someone who knows a lot, and I don't."
3,"Over rated, recommended Antique Trader's 2004 Price Guide",Kovel's like Martha are over rated. They can't know all. I recommend the Antique Trader 2004 Price Guide. The Antique Trader authors go to the expert for the information and give them credit.
5,Much better than a normal drill/driver,"I am in the process of finishing by basement, and I decided to make the process a little easier, I was going to get a drywall screwgun. This past weekend, my brother and brother-in-law were helping me hang drywall on the ceiling, and I was using this screwgun and they were using an 18v drill/driver. I could drive 5 to 6 screws in the time it took them to do one, and each screw was the same dept, no torn paper and no having to go back to redrive screws that weren't all the way in.I would very much reccomend this to someone who plans on hanging drywall, although I cannot yet speak for its long term durability, it seems very well made."
1,get a dewalt dw272,This screwgun just doesnt compare to the dewalt dw272! This gun grinds the screws every time. It just isnt as smooth as the dewalt. I like bosch a lot. But on this screwgun dewalt has the better tool!
2,An Easy Read,"James Stewart's words will flow from his pages into your mind like sweet, warm, dark chocolate satisfying your hunger for a wonderful story like few other nonfiction books you will ever read, but when you are done all you will have found is that the indulgence was sweet, but instead of developing a stronger mind, you will find only that your brain has gained a couple hundred pounds of fat. This book is so easy and enjoyable to read you will find yourself forgetting that you bought the book to learn how to write better nonfiction, and when you are done you will find that you cannot remember what you have been taught. This book is a real rubber hammer."
5,sheer distilled genius,I've not seen a better book that explains the craft of newspaper/magazine feature writing. Stewart's previous books were wonderful and he well deserved his Pulitzer Prize. Now he's distilled that knowledge for others. This is the book I use in the classes I teach on magazine/newspaper feature writing.
3,An engaging read. Advice for all interested in writing.,"I found Mr. Stewart's book to be very pleasant to read. I am not a journalist nor a non-fiction novelist by profession but i found many of his expressed techniques to be readily adaptable to any kind of report writing.I was a little disappointed in how he primarily used his own work as examples. It would have been nice to see examples from other sources. In fact there were times when i thought i was reading a long report on why i should read other works by Mr. Stewart. Nonetheless, reading ""Follow the Story"" is time well spent."
3,Shakey!,"I bought this along with the $50 base which is quite heavy. Regardless, the thing shakes like crazy. There's a sweet spot with the speed where the harmonics of the vibration are less, but at pretty much any speed it shakes. I just use it to cut templates for my router, so I don't need much precision, but I couldn't imaging doing precision work with this with that kind of vibration."
1,Not happy,Bought this tool to get into scrolling and make Christmas presents. I'm very dissapointed. Pinless blades can only be used once because the wing screw that holds the blade bends and breaks it. There is alot of vibration too. I normally buy higher end tools and won't make this mistake again.
2,Dremel 1800 Scroll Saw Disappointments,"The practice of just slapping an address label on a manufacturer's box and ""shippin' it"" is pitiful at best. The saw arrived coming out the bottom of the box and parts were broken (which I subsequently had to order from Dremel). My experiences with Amazon of late have been awful. The manual for the saw had been taped to the top of the box lid and was an older edition not showing the current parts for assembly."
5,dremel is a plus,"Dremel always supplies great products, so I expected one again. I was not let down. It works perfectly and I am becoming fast friends with it. Great product from a great company.The best surprise was the customer service I received from Amazon. I had to talk to them a few times and hands down, got better than I could have hoped."
1,Used Equipment,"The Dremel Scroll Saw that I received was defective, and previously owned. As received the saw would not run. I removed the access covers to evaluate the problem. During this operation I discovered tool marks made your provious customer when he tried to evaluate/repair the defect.The defect was a misinstalled auxillary drive arm. This was an original assembly positioning error. This indicated that the misassembled saw was not tested by the original manufacturer.I have corrected the misassembly and the saw appears to function correctly.I think the following actions are required:1. Develop a basic quality assurance program with your suppliers.2. Change your operation pattern to assume that when a customer returns a produce, it returned for a reason and not because he is an idiot that likes to ship things back."
4,Great Book for Beginners,"This is a great book for beginners - easy to understand, yet you can grasp some big pictures. Serious learners might want to look for more advanced level books, as I had to use other books whenever I needed to learn in depth."
1,Flabbergasted - all about the numbers?!,"The fact that 24 out of 25 reviews on this site hold that this movie is excellent causes me to seriously question the the overall competence of the human species.This movie is not smart. Its attempts at dramatic tension fail. There are so many anomalous scenes that are jarringly bizarre, and yet they don't work together at all. In the last ten minutes, the screenwriter transparently feels a need to cleverly tie back all the characters together in a random collage of uninteresting, undeveloped people. It wants to be Usual Suspects, but is more like... Nothing comes to mind. This movie is horrendously written, bizarrely edited, and will make you long for the two hours back."
4,"Cool, Ironic, Understated Mayhem","A struggling writer who's a talented cardsman gets a job as a croupier, thanks to his father, in a London casino. From there the film moves into a complicated scheme to rob the casino, with violence and double dealing along the way. The one unexpected bit of retribution that hits Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) has emotional power. The ending is not exactly nihilistic, but has more than a bit of irony.Mike Hodges, who directed the first-rate Get Carter with Michael Caine, brings the same cool approach here. Owen is perfect in the lead, and the rest of the cast is excellent. Croupier is a very good story very well done.The DVD transfer also is excellent. There are no extras."
5,Re:Review from Mr. Bullock from Austin,"I have the DVD, it's a great quality picture and sound and no the film is not edited. The DVD is 94 minutes as is the official running time of the movie. If you didn't understand the ending, you just didn't understand the ending! So it's fullscreen, big deal, put a soother in your mouth and go to bed. A fabulous movie and DVD all around, nuff said!"
4,Solid British Thriller,"Croupier's protagonist (Clive Owen, in a very interesting performance in his pre-fame days) is a taciturn, unsuccessful writer living in London, who at the instigation of his father accepts a job as a croupier in a casino. He takes the job in order to write a novel about it, in which he can watch this particular milieu from above, in a detached and superior position. In the casino he meets a number of people, including the troubled Bella (Kate Hardie, in my view, the movie's most compelling character). Other character, the gambler Jani (Alex Kingston) will eventually involve him in a plot to rob the place. This movie let us know more details about the gambling business that we may be interested to know, and the final twist doesn't really hold water, making the movie end in a somewhat disappointing note, but all in all this is a solid, unusual thriller."
1,Great Film - Bad DVD !!,"Croupier is a fantastic film, but, this DVD has been edited for content to the degree that the story doesn't make sense. Also, the DVD version has been formatted to fit your television screen. I was very disappointed in the DVD release of this otherwise absolutely superb film"
4,croupier,A very good movie that I missed on the first go-round. So i bougt it to watch Clive Owen. i cannot rember anything or any line that stuck in my mind. So i would say see for yourself who am i to judge anyway.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Vastly overrated in some quarters but nonetheless a pleasing-enough slow burn thriller from the director of Get Carter, Croupier is short on action but long on style, with a performance by Clive Owen that placed him number one in many people's ""next Bond"" lists; as long as you don't go in expecting a modern masterpiece you're likely to leave happy."
5,Late Night Euphoria!,"If you are a music fan who believes that music can lift you up from the depths of despair to emotional highs of euphoria, this is one CD you should not miss.""Like a Lover"" is sad and nostalgic, yet it soars to the point of anchoring you among the clouds. As the title suggests, this should be played late at night or in the wee hours, when the mind and the spirit is uncluttered. Close your eyes, and let Klugh's smooth melodies soothe your tired and weary mind."
5,Excellent. Should be re-released immediately.,I've listened to this album way way back in cassette tape format. I liked it so much that after constant play and replay it got warped and damaged. I've been looking for another copy in vain for years. I was hoping that it will be re-released in Feb. 99. I hope it will push through. It will surely be a hit!
5,Glad I Read This Book,"A thoroughly enjoyable book. This account of a modern day group of (mostly inexperienced) men undertaking to recreate as closely as possible the Viking voyages from Greenland to Newfoundland is written in a mostly light-hearted vein and is liberally sprinkled with bits of Viking lore and history, making it both entertaining and enlightening. Amusing instead of macho. Makes me wish I'd been along on the trip."
4,Compact easy to use bike computer,This unit has many features to give you more information than you probably need. One feature I found to be interesting is the accumulation of the time you spend riding. You get the trip time plus the total time you have spent riding the bike on all trips while using this computer. Similar to the trip mileage and ODO mileage. Only complaint is about the mounting of the transmitter. Topeak gives you a single band strap which snapped when I tried to tighten it. I think it would be better to have a mounting bracket that would use 2 plastic wire ties. Had this broken at a point where there was not enough left to wrap the fork I would have had to find a whole new bracket.It's a good computer at a reasonable price.
4,all american,"rose-buDD bitter-dose Is a true legend,self -made PI this book takes you into the life of the In and out's not a how to manual by far. A great read none the less If you looking for a how to manual this is not for you.Pimpin must be In you you cannot gain It from a book.none the less this novel take you further in depth Into what a real life life is like for a true P.I. up's and down and turn-0 around's. that's just my opinion ,as well as some of the forgotten and un written laws that should be followed..I liked It, just my opinion personally and I'm an open minded person.I never judge a book by It's cover certainly not this one so If your looking for more than a real life record or a how to this Is not the book and you will never find a how to pimp 101 It has not and will not be written EVER!!It will and always be a congolmerate of un-written laws to live and die by.unfortunately"
5,Outstanding Advice Book for Men,"I've had friends tell me ""If you want to REALLY know how to make love to a woman, ask a lesbian."" While I'm not totally sure if that's correct advice, thanks to this book I no longer need to. This book is full of wonderful advice and tips and is written in a very down to earth style.The authors make a point not to be condescending toward we ""males,"" while providing information about communication, foreplay, and being sexual with women in ways other than straight intercourse. It was a delight to find out that yes, women DO like you to go slow at first!I was quite heartened to see the authors taking a very favorable and non-judgmental view towards SM. There are also sections about fisting a woman and what to do when you run into ""roadblocks"" in a relationship.This is a book I know I'll refer to again and again."
5,Every man and woman should read this book&#65533;,"This is a must read for every man and woman; it cover a variety subjects in a striate forward and upright (no pun intended) manner, with chapters describing the vulva to chapters that describing how best to communicate with one another. Even if you feel you know all there is to know about sex, this book may show you something new and worth trying out. I think this book should be required reading for both women and men when they reach the age of eighteen. I only wish this book had been published when I was eighteen!I would have learned a lot more, a lot faster.A good companion book to get would be ""Femalia"" by Joani Blank. It's photo book of women's vulvas; it's a realistic look at a part of a woman body."
2,What else is new?,"I think the authors of this book forgot one very important tenet of human relationships: straight men do not and will never think like lesbian women. Furthermore, this book offers no new advice and no new Spots to discover. You could very well scour the web or read a couple of men's magazines and get the same information. Another generic sex book."
5,"EDUCATIONAL, WELL WRITTEN & AROUSING","My wife and I have been married a long time, but the female body had always been somewhat of a mystery. She's quite open in bed, but I still wonder-What gives her the most pleasure? Where should I be touching or rubbing her. This book answers all those questions. This book provides wonderful sexual advise to help any man become a better lover. My wife is so pleased, she can't thank me enough..."
1,Misleading premise,I have to agree with the reviewer who questioned the notion of a lesbian guide for hetero sex. Since sex is the issue here we have a right to insist on advice that comes from useful experience. Lesbian sex can never be more than mutual masturbation. Without any first-hand knowledge of penetration the authors have little to offer the hetero reader. I would look further for a good sex guide.
4,Ignore review #1,"A word of advice---Ignore the first review. It was obviously written by someone looking for an easy fix to a classroom assignment. No plot? Well---I guess that's because it's a book of essays written ABOUT McCullers work. The author HATES McCullers for having written it? She didn't. It's a series of essays analyzing McCullers' work. The collection was gathered (that is edited) by Clark and Friedman. If you want critical work about McCullers instead of the ramblings of someone who obviously put no thought or knowledge into a response, get this book."
1,THIS IS THE WORST BOOK IN THE WORLD,NEVER EVER READ THIS BOOK! This is the worst book in the world. It has no plot and no action what so ever. I can't believe people would read this book for pleasure. I only read it because I had to write an essay on it. I am never going to read any of Carson Mccullers other books and I would strongly recomend you not to either. It is poorly written and I hate Carson Mccullers for writing it!
5,A nut and fruit lovers extravaganza,"For one who loves fruits and nuts, and with the growing availability of exotic fruits, this book is a winner. With the author's experience at Trotter's and Coyote Cafe, this guy is good. Some are simple and others quite complex, but each fulfills its promise of delivering uniqueness and packed flavor. From soups to breads to puddings, this is a great dessert resource. Too bad, it's out of print. Great addition to a food lovers collection."
5,What Do You Say When A Monkey Asks This Way,"This book teaches manners to your child! Little Monkey goes through the week learning how to be a Big Monkey and showing he can apologize, say please and thank you, and share! Children will enjoy the repetition of, ""What did Mama Monkey say?"" after each misbehavior. Parents will enjoy how readily and happily he corrects his behavior! This is a must for anyone who wishes to help someone learn good manners."
1,the coffee is wonderful but igourmet's price is CRAZY,"Douwe Egberts coffee is AMAZING. After living in Holland for 2 years, I can't drink any other. But do not buy it from this seller. The shipping and handling charge as well as the charge for the coffee are just plain RIDICULOUS. You get a tiny little package (250 gm or about 1/2 a pound) for this price and you'll be charged nearly twice that amount just for shipping. Go to a Dutch-American website and buy it instead. There are plenty of websites with FAIR prices for 500gm with decent shipping. Of course this coffee costs more, it's imported. But igourmet is ripping you off!"
3,Good for the money,"I ordered two of these.The first one was easy to assemble.The second one required a drill. One of the seat brace holes was about a quarter inch off so I had to widen it to get the bolt to match. Believe me I thought I could get it without drilling by no luck. The plastic tray didn't match the holes, so had to drill those too. No big deal, but wasn't lickety split.The paint chips off easily.The seat is so so, its a little too squishy.The wheels roll fine...mine are red.The tray is handy!I am 6' tall, 200 lbs and love having these to work on the bikes.This probably isn't the ""greatest"" out there, but for 25 bucks you can't beat it."
2,Caution.. They don't tell you...,"Received product from amazon in a timely manner. easy to assemble.However, a warning to people. The box states this creeper chair only supports up to 250 lbs.Nowhere on the description of the item does it state that.I weigh about 270 and was unaware of the weight limitations especially since the product says ""heavy duty"".So for folks out there who weigh above 250lbs, be cautious and think twice before ordering.Otherwise, this is a good product for the money."
3,"It's a Creeper, not a Leaper","It is exactly what you should expect, if you only pay $25.00 for a garage item. It works just as advertised. Enough said."
2,Torin mechanic's seat,I am only giving two stars because the cushioned seat does not have much cushioning. After sitting on it once or twice it squishes down right to the wood; consequently it is not comfortable. I have a very sensitive bottom. Other than that it is ok.
1,screws missing,"This was given as a gift, and he had to return the product, as he had tried to assemble it and found some screws missing."
4,Quick and easy creeper,"Get a philips head screw driver and a couple wrenches.Takes a few minutes to get everything lined up, but all in all went together pretty easily.Has a max weight of 250 pounds, and it looks like it probably wouldn't do well holding much more than that.Beyond that, the wheels move smoothly, the seat is squishy and comfortable, and it's great having a little tray that's always within reach right underneath of you!"
5,he likes it..,Just purchased this for a mechanic friend & he said it is well made & the wheels worked very good on surfaces.He seems very pleased so I would recommend this due his good response to this creeper seat.
4,Good stool,The only problem I have with this seat is one of the wheels sticks and does not swivel as it should.I could have sent it back but decided it was not all that bad.It is well made other than that.
4,3 1/2 Irish Tenors,"This second concert of the Irish Tenors does not quite measure up to the first in the song selections but it is very enjoyable nonetheless. However, I miss John McDermott . Although Finbar Wright has a fine voice and a pleasant presence, he does not add the same quality as McDermott, who has a particularly ""Irish"" tenor voice and a great stage presence and manner. Without McDermott the Irish Tenors seem more like a secondary version of the ""other"" three tenors and not so uniquely Irish."
5,:>),This is a VERY fun movie. It has great charachters. And a Great story. The Scenery is also absolutely spectacular. I think you oughta see it:>)
5,"""A Far Off Place"" is far out!","I saw the Disney movie when I was little, and now I have read the book. ""A Far Off Place"" in conjunction with ""A Story Like The Wind"" is amazing. Maybe I was so surprised because of the injustice done to the book by the movie. Read it! Not only is it fun, but it does have many themes and ideas that are not western in origion."
2,bleh,"This movie was so predictable it made me sick.They turned a powerful captivating book into generic average american teenager trash. Though i wasnt particulaly fond of the 2 main charactors in the book they had depth, and they werent so predictable. And what may i ask happend to the plot? instead of communists being the villians it was verry capitalist greedy moneymen.kinda ironic... and where is the african culture? the great singing tree of the makoba? the magic? Also its play at feminism was amusing. How is the strong masculine heroine weakening throughout the movie as she falls in love feminist? Read the books instead."
1,Read the books instead,"This film is interesting and somewhat effective as a piece of cinema. That said, its story is so far removed from van der Post's indiosyncratic novels (upon which the film is ostensibly based) as to be almost unrecognizable. Only one connection to the two novels remains: both the film and the books are set in Africa. Beyond that, just about every other element of the books' narratives has been changed, usually so that the film follows some shallow Hollywood plotline, but at the expense of van der Post's encyclopedic knowledge and love of Bushman life and culture. As a result, the film is watchable, but its destruction of the novels is almost as complete as the razing of Hunters Drift by poachers in the film version."
4,good family entertainment,"This is a movie you can share with your children. It is good entertainment and shows values of self-reliance, loyalty, and honesty. The acting is excellent. Shows cultures that aren't often seen in books or movies."
5,One of my all time favorites!!!,"I love this movie! I first saw it when I was a freshman in High School, and I now use it to teach a geography lesson on the Kalahari for my eighth graders. They love it, too. One of my favorite comments from them was ""I can't believe we are all hooked on a Disney Movie!"" This came from a boy no less!"
5,A Daring Adventure,"Wonderful scenery, talented cast, and a good script and story. I saw this years ago on my grandmother's dish with The Disney Channel. Very grateful to have it in my collection finally. Ooh I could comment on so many things I liked... but that would be giving you spoilers. I think you better just watch A Far Off Place yourself. :-)"
2,Big Disappointment!!!,I had read the other books in the series and LOVED them. But this one was lacking alot. You never felt like these characters connected at all. You kept waiting for the love that the other books had and this one just didn't have it. I hope the next one is better.
2,Worst story in the series!,"Miranda deserved better than this! Why did Landry have to pine away for his wife the way that he did? It made Miranda seem like trash and a little beggar. I was really disappointed with this story, as the others have been very intriguing and romantic. I hope JESSICA is much better."
3,I liked it,"I had to read this one in the series to find out what happened to Jacob! Before I even read this one I knew who Miranda was going to hook up with & how the book would read. It is still a short, sweet, easy little book to read when you have just a few hours of down-time. These books do keep you at least a little up to date on the previous characters that make up the town of Springwater. I may just read the next one to find out how these characters are doing."
3,Needed more desk space,Just what I was looking for. A light oak file sorter that matched my light oak file cabinets. Good for separating files of different content or priority. I would have gone for a taller model if found but this is adequate for now. I recommend it.
2,Chances are.... 50-50,"I bought 2 for my boss' office. One was good - another was poorly made! Hence your chance of being a happy customer or an angry customer is 50-50!This is a typical example of this type of product being made in a half-automated factory made mostly by hand. The one with a poor quality (pictures are uploaded) had slots that were uneven in depth, the sleeves were cut in slightly different sizes, so some shelves wobbled while some were too tight to even remove as if glued on. One corner didn't align which makes this particular one too embarassing to be used in anybody's office. Probably made by someone on his/her first day on the job. The better quality one, on the other hand, was probably made by someone who had been making this a long time - very consistent through out. I would have given 5 stars had I received 2 of the good ones. I would have given no stars had I received 2 of the poor quality ones."
4,nice stackable,"everything that it was advertised to be, a nick on back side due to shipping that glue fixed"
3,Stackable Sorter,"I find that the units are of mediocre quality. It has multiple shelf slots but, after calling Safco, I found out that the additional shelves are not avilable. I was truly disappointed. It serves my needs in sorting but the shelves are too far apart."
2,Poor quality for the price,"Was very excited to open the box today when it arrived. The color is great; however, I was immediately disappointed that a $47 organizer would have such thin, cheap shelves. Ultimately, I had to return it, because the joints were not totally secure or aligned. The light interior of wood looked awful when exposed due to the poor carpentry."
3,Cheaply Made But Looks Okay,"I bought this because it was the perfect size to fit on my desk and for it's mahogany finish. It's fairly sturdy but there are small blemishes on the finish. Also, the grooves that hold the removable shelves are unfinished, which makes it look cheap. Despite these defects I'm actually happy with it. It's the only file sorter I could find with a mahogany finish."
3,compact organizer,"This is not a beautiful piece of furniture, but a nice accessory for an office desk. Makes organizing much easier. I like"
3,Good for non sewers,Okay book for beginning and non sewers. Doesn'thave any really fashionable ideas. I'm still waiting for a really good book.
2,Very few original Ideas,I was not impresseed by the ideas in this book... They have all been done before !!
3,Okay if you are skinny,"I think these fashion ideas are great for the model figure -but wouldn't wear as well for someone more endowed -again this is one artist's interpretation of re-altering clothing, etc.But it certainly is well worth purchasing..."
2,Solar Address Rock,"Look for another solar powered product. Very disappointed with this item, the numbers are hard to work.I broke two plastic screws trying to remove the plate to get to the numbers."
1,A pretty trifle,"This little book, the size of a CD jewel case, stretches a few short articles on champagne to fit 64 pages. There are pretty pictures, and some amusing type design. It might make a nice accompaniment to a gift of champagne, but if you're looking, as I was, for something substantive on the history and making of champagne, forget it.In any event, I'm deeply suspicious of any book that comes with a list of places to buy ""glasses and other bubbly accessories."""
4,It was worth the $1 that I paid for it...3.5 stars,"In reality, this book is probably closer to a 3 star rating. However, given what I believe to be a rather unfair ""1 star"" rating on the part of the previous reviewer, I feel the need to counter-balance the negativity with a positive review. Granted, this book is a bit of a fluff piece. However, for just one dollar (purchased at a nationally known discount book store) the book presents a cursory introduction to the world of champagne and sparkling wine. Moreover, the photography of the book is aesthetically pleasing as well. In essence this is a miniature coffee table book; it's something that you might keep with photographic books about chocolate or tea - a kind of decorative book to be thumbed through occasionally during festive times of the year.If you can find this book on a discount shelf for $1 or $2, it's worth purchasing."
5,OUTSTANDING- Victor has done it again,"This book had me thinking about the characters when I was at work...like they were real people. I absolutely loved this book!I think what I liked best was that nobody was ""perfect"". Legacy came close but he had faults, too. It was a mix of fantasy with a whole lot of realness! The women in the story were true to life because you find that a lot of women WILL betray you and you only have maybe one or two women in your life that you can trust and that you can call ""friend"" (woman to woman).... There were a lot of good points about this book and most importantly the theme that every sistah wants ""reciprocity"". It was mentioned in the beginning of the book at the ""Chat"" but I like how Alphonzo broke it down for everyone.....I really enjoyed the story. I am looking forward to the next release!!!"
2,Didn't Do Justice,This book is the sequeal to Autumn Leaves and Every Sistah Wants It did not do Autumn Leaves any justice at all is not even worth talking about. I told Botanika to read it and I regret it...sorry gurl!!!Later!!!!
5,When I was 14 years old.,"I was skating when I was younger, and the Altar Boys were the christian alternative for bands like Nine Inch Nails and Suicidal Tendancies. Their chord structure and beat truely represent the ""grunge - punk"" of the eighties (when you could actually tell what the singer was saying).All in all, if you like punk - this is an Excellent example of the sound punk should have stayed with. I've heard and played many different styles, but I have never heard the clean sound of the Altar Boys' (for lack of a better phrase) 'gut level music' and message replicated anywhere since then.BUY THIS ALBUM... YOU WON'T REGRET IT.-- REBELS FOR CHRIST! --"
3,Performs perfectly as long as you don't drop it,"I bought two of these ice cream containers, and they work great. However, my little cousin took one out of the freezer, and then accidentally dropped it, and it broke. I expected Tupperware to survive the fall, but I guess I expected too much. I haven't bought another one to replace it, because I don't make as much ice cream as I thought I would. One is enough."
5,Music that warms the heart and soul,"The soundtrack of the movie is absolutely wonderful! The music is written and performed in a style reninescent of the jazz age, but with a new age style sprinkled throughout. Tell Me Lies is a georgeous piece that stirs the soul. Our Time Has Come is a fantastic song about overcoming the odds, and rising to the top, being in the spotlight. While listening to this music, the lyrics continue to roll around in your head:Our time has comeWe're gonna walk in the sun,And you and I are ready to roll,We're on our way.With a little faith we canStep from the shadows, andTell everyone turn the spotlight onNow our time has come.This soundtrack is very positive, and very hard to find anywhere but here (I've looked in all the major stores). I strongly recommend this CD. Enjoy the music!"
5,A keep-u-up-all-night romance!,"I've just recently discovered Rexanne Becnel, and I can't tell you how pleased I am. It's always exciting when you find a new author who you know you can rely on to deliver an extraordinarily, good romance. So far, I've read ""Dangerous to Love"" and ""The Bridemaker"" by Rexanne Becnel, and I can't recommend them highly enough. I won't go into plot details, but will simply repeat the Romantic Times quote on the back of the ""The Bridemaker""... ""run, don't walk, to buy"" it. I couldn't agree more!"
1,The Title was misleading,"I am a fan of Marco Ruas and this DVD had his style of fighting and also Ken Shamrocks name on the cover. This title sucks!!! none of the actual people featured on the cover were highlighted in the video. The closest thing was the literally 2 secs of showing Ken shamrocks face because he was behind a student! As a mixed martial arts fan, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. Overall I would not recommend it because it is misleading."
3,Worth checking out,"Very interesting combination of talent, and fairly interesting tale. Ingrid Thulin is a concentration camp survivor who returns ""from the ashes"" to find her philandering, younger chess master husband (Maximillian Schell) involved with a younger woman (Samantha Eggar) to whom she is also connected. The screenplay isn't nearly as clever as it tries to be, but it's fun to see Eggar play nasty, and her bathtub seen IS quite well done. J. Lee Thompson's career went disastrously downhill after this. The streaming version is standard-def letterboxed, but of good quality."
3,Good: beautiful illustrations. Bad: not enough description,"That pretty much sums it up about Stella Blum's slender paperbound volume Paris Fashions of the 1890s: A Picture Sourcebook with 350 Designs, Including 24 in Full Color. The good side is that the presentation is up to Dover's usual high standard and the illustrations, originally from a British fashion journal of the period, are spectacular, mostly in black-and-white but with some lovely full-color plates. The bad is that aside from the introductory essay, and brief descriptions at the bottom of each page, there's not much in the way of text explaining the outfits the reader is viewing. That makes the book somewhat problematic for people who are trying to reconstruct period fashions for, say, a play or reenactment, but it's still quite a valuable document for people with a general interest in Victorian/Edwardian fashion. It really works best in conjunction with Dover's other books on the subject edited by Ms. Blum and Joanne Olian."
1,Stale (and thats being nice),"Very Stale, i had a leftover jellybean from a previous purchase/seller that i crushed in my finger in comparison with these and they are definatly VERY stale if not fake not to mention most are smushed and look like blue candlewax and sugar. at least they came in 2 days right?"
4,Tina Marsh and the Creative Opportunity Orchestra,Tina Marsh uses her role as vocalist and composer for CO2 to create music for voice that is stunning in complexity and pure jazz inventiveness while pushing the limits of vocal music with one of the most beautiful voices around. This album is sung without words. CO2 is a collaboration among none but the most outstanding musicians.
2,Not Office Space funny,My hubby and I watched this on the recommendation of a friend. We both felt that it was a bit awkward and too intense to be enjoyable.
3,Mila and Jason and Kristen helped this movie along.,"Was a background while you surf the Internet movie. Slow plot. Worth watching. Cozy. Ridiculous. Kristen's character as the wife summed it up, ""Why don't you just talk to me?"""
1,not worth watching even if it was free,"Not even one funny part. I felt sorry for all involved, I was honestly surprised at how flat the entire thing was."
4,Pretty funny...,"I liked this movie. I would watch it again. However, if you have seen the previews, you have seen the funniest parts of the movies. I wish they wouldn't do that for movie trailers."
3,"Extract, not as good as Office Space","From the creators of Office SpaceOffice Space - Special Edition with Flair (Widescreen Edition)now comes Extract. A movie whose trailer left me wanting more. However when the movie arrived it turned out pretty much all the really funny scenes were in the trailer and the movie didn't add much more.Yes, Jason Bateman is a funny guy. I mean, the guy played in Arrested DevelopmentArrested Development - The Complete Series (Seasons 1, 2, 3)and thus we will always respect him. Yes, Mila Kunis is a very beautiful girl, and even Ben Affleck does a good job here. But the film never managed to hold my attention and charm me the way Office Space did. Office Space which just has a better atmosphere, more and better supporting characters and a better feeling inserted.Extract has some funny moments, some very funny even, but as a whole it disappoints. The extras found on the Blu-Ray don't add much either.Paul"
2,What were they thinking?,"This is just so bad. I didn't think Mike Judge was capable of this after the brilliant Office Space. Bateman plays his role well, but he is surrounded by unfunny characters weighed down with unfunny dialogue. The storyline is quite forced, and nearly every scene is uncomfortably reaching...and not making it. Affleck has never been funny, just doesn't have the timing and vibe as a comedic actor. There isn't a single character in this film that measures up to the many fine portrayals in OS, least of all the masterful performance turned in by Gary Cole as the incredibly smarmy Bill Lumbergh. Even the best moment in the movie -- the sweatpants getting tied up -- isn't as good as it is in the trailer. I don't remember laughing during Extract, I only got a few mild chuckles out of it. Judge is obviously a gifted guy, I'm hoping this effort is the exception to the rule."
4,We're almost out of Pepsi...I'm calling Dominos to deliver some.,Another Mike Judge home run! It hasn't acheived Office Space status yet however its another gem filled with excellent characters. Ben Affleck's best role ever if you ask me.
1,Terrible and boring,I wanted to like this movie so much. Come on Mike you can do it! Nope. Meandering script. Incomplete story arcs. Nothing funny in the story or dialogue. Brilliant actors directed into oblivion.
3,Great Actors cant save bad writing.,"Casting for this movie was great, second to none. Great actors and actresses in leading and supporting roles. Liked almost everyone in it. The acting is good too, no complaints there. The only down, which is a pretty important one, is the writing. The movie just was not funny. I was surprised and disappointed since it was a Mike Judge film but the movie just seems to start off slow, and glide to a stop. Rent it, dont buy it."
3,Pretty Good!!!,"I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this! There were a few funny parts, but nothing where you laugh out loud at. Joel Reynolds owns an extract company and falls in love with a beautiful con-artist named Cindy. While he is high, he tries to get a gigolo to sleep with his wife while he can have an affair with Cindy, but the plan backfires. I probably wouldn't recommend EXTRACT!!!"
5,A very different album,"This is 12 Stones second album, they have much more new material on here, unlike their debut album, the songs sound less similar. But the absence of guitar solos is very obvious, but the interesting melodies make up for it. They didn't go too far from their roots, their sound is still thereOther than the hit single ""Far Away"", standout tracks include ""Shadows"" ""The Last Song and ""Speak Your Mind"". ""Photograph"" displays a lot of emotion, ""Shadows"" has heaviness and ""Far Away"" displays pain. With these characteristics, they have broadened their sound by far.This is a must have for any 12 Stones fan, they've really worked hard on this album, so let's all enjoy the results"
4,Outstanding,"I have this second CD in my cd player in my car all the time. It absolutely helps me unwind after a long day in ""Cubeville"". I guess I should reveal that I am 50 and love most all of the new rock. However, this one stands out as one of my favorites. Right next to my Pearl Jam Live at Madison Square Garden, this cd is a true ""wow!"" collection of tunes. Have to say the song order is just right. Makes my life a little better each day when I am cruising the highway to get home. Can't wait for their next gem."
4,now this what rock music sounds like,i was never a crhistian rock person but this is some of the best crhistian rock music ive ever heard
2,This band sounds like blah......,"This band bores me. I went out and bought this album in hopes that it would be better then there last album. Well, its better then there last album, but still not that good. Same old sound. Nothing new going on in there music. I guess if you like the whole Creed sound then they might be good, but I never liked Creed. 12 Stones just has a weak rock sound that never catches me and pulls me into the music. If your going to buy this album, buy it used...."
5,12 Stones is AMAZING!!!!,"Iv'e been listening to 12 Stones since I saw them in Hershey, PA when they opened for Creed. I loved the self-titled album but this album is far better than that one. Anyone who listens to rock music will enjoy this cd! Also, if you ahve the chance to see 12 Stones live I strongly urge you to go. I saw them recently also and they sounded great and had a very entertaining set. The christian rock genre needs more artists like 12 Stones, Pillar, Kutless, and Blindside. Do yourself a favor and pick up this album, you won't regret it."
4,Captivating,"Eager to shake compairisons to the band creed, 12 stones offered up ""potter's field"", a 2004 rock release with more of a melodic alternative metal approach. The band comes off more in the vein of breaking benjamin and staind with PF, which seems to suit them a little bit better. Songs open with thrashing guitars and move into subtle, but catchy, verses. Even for those of you who sit patient just for the chorus', PF is a winner. Song for song, PF is worth every penny. Two years later, I still pick this record up and throw it on from time to time. So if you havent heard from 12 stones lately, listen again. You'll be in for a surprise."
3,Good Sound Bad Songs...,"This is 12 Stones second album and it's not as good as the first, well, the sound the music part was. most of the songs were not for me and they had no rythme to them or meaning, but here are some songs that i did like.1. Shadows2. Last Song3.Bitter."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I adore music of all kinds because I am blessed with a father inclined that way. To us, music is lifeblood so perhaps you can understand my disappointment when I heard 12 Stones new release, Potter's Field. I listen to their debut album from start to finish often and I felt they had something that set them aside from the rest of the bands pouring from the woodwork these last few years. The new release has not proved it to me. I find it mostly uninspired, not consistently rhythmic and I personally like to hear the singing over the guitar. I have listened to this CD continually and it has not grown on me and probably won't. If I was pressed to, I'd select The Last Song, track 2, Far Away, track 3, Bitter, track 6, and Stay, track 9... to download. I really would not suggest spending good money on the CD unless you're simply a die-hard fan who'll buy anything."
2,Its not the same,"12 Stones' debut album is my favorite ever. The guitar work was prolific. The vocals were outstanding. This album...doesn't deliver. I dont like a single song. A friend borrowed the cd from me about a month and a half ago and then went to military training and I havent been able to get the cd back. Thing is, I dont care if I ever get it back. Buy the first cd twice. You'll get more for your money."
5,A new fan.,"If you are looking at this review, you have probably heard of 12 Stones and this style of music. So, I see no need to comment on that. I will however say a few words about my experience with this cd, since I am a new fan. This one is a better cd than the one entitled 12 stones. I especially like the songs ""Stay"" and ""Bitter."" In fact, the whole experience fits well between the ears as soon as you pop it in the cd player. No filler tracks here. Even a friend enjoyed it and inquired who this was while we were riding in the car."
5,These boys from Louisiana Rock!!!,Now you gotta hand it these boys from small town Louisiana because they just rock. Good song solid song structure with crunch guitars and pounding bass. This and their first release are solid. I wish rock radio would give these guys more of a chance. They are better than 50% of the bands on radio today. Good work guys.
3,Potter's Field,"Omg this cd rox! The songs are deeper and sound more professional. Every song has a lot of emotion and no matter how many times i listen, it never gets old. If you don't already have Potter's Field, buy it now! and get their self titled album 2. :)"
1,still haven't recieved,"I ordered two posters from adam hersh about three months ago and only one got here. I emailed them twice and got an automated email back. After a third email requesting a refund I got a curt two sentence response saying ""It's in the mail. If you want a refund you may refuse it when it is delivered."" My poster still hasn't arrived and the one I did get had a little bend and tear in it. Adam Hersh Poster was a pain to deal with."
3,So So,Marc has great technique but played into his own style.He's not a David Benoit............Berne
1,Not entertaining at all!!,"I own more than 2000 cd's and like to think I know something about music. This cd is a great disapointment, it lacks the soothing sound of what trumpet music should be all about. Even if you lower your standard and accept bad trumpet playing for the sake of having a decent modern lounge type of music cd, this cd really doesn't cut it. The songs are plaine boring and miss creativity. When you hear 2 songs, you have heard them all. There is litte continuity on this album other than mediocrity. Too bad."
1,Not very entertaining !,"For those who bought the previous one , stick to it. This is the same thing but without any fun.For those who love ""house music"" , there's one groovy title : Irony. wait for the single it will be shipper and you'll maybe get remixes.For those who love jazz , the trumpet player Bert Joris is a must but go and find Bert Joris quartet live album.For me , there's no good reason to buy this record , not very entertaining."
5,Get Both of These Beautiful Volumes,"The virtues of this book and its companion (Volume II) are numerous:- Bailyn is a respected historian whose knowledge of the founding era is surpassed by few. His Ideological Origins of the American Revolution is a gem.- The book is beautifully bound and attractive on any bookshelf. Another fine specimen from the Library of America.- The selection of both federalist and anti-federalist writings and speeches, plus their presentation in a logical order, is outstanding.- The books serve as an outstanding reference volume. It is rare when I read a quote of a particular founding father and cannot find it in context in these volumes.The list goes on. If you're a student of the era, a lover of beautiful books (take the dust jacket off and present them on your bookshelf!), or merely interested in learning more about America's founding, these volumes can't be beat."
5,Existentialism,"This book is a monument to 20th century thought. Here, find out how to make sense of a God-less universe. Discover why ""existence precedes essence"". You seach for your own meaning in a world that has no objective purpose. This book will make you re-examine yourself and the way you observe the world around you. Read it and your horizons will expand infinetely!"
3,Geared towards teens,"This movie is geared towards teens, the concept is good... but lacks a bit in the special effects. Good buy for the price."
5,Awesome Software,"I dabbled in chess for a few years, but never really got into it until I got this software. The analysis tools are amazing. My favorite feature is the explain all moves. Every legal move gets ranked, a quick description, and the expected variation. The only drawback is that this is not for true beginners. If you just know how the pieces move, you might want to look elsewhere for basic tactics. Even on a weak setting, this engine will PUNISH a bad move."
2,TOO MANY FILES,"The chess playing is OK, but trying to save a game is absurdly difficult. Why do software writers think we need a ZILLION FILES. Why do they think we want to click a dozen times to access one simple function. I operate under the princilpe of SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY. Why is the operating principle of this kind of software COMPLICATE, COMPLICATE, COMPLICATE. While code writers get orgasmic over all the crap they include in the software, we users have to waste riduculous amounts of time TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SIMPLE TASKS. In my wildest dreams I could not design a more ABSURD system for saving games than the code that comes with Fritz 8"
2,Not exactly what i had expected.,"Chess. Not much to it. However since i was a first time player to the game, i thought due to other reviews of this game that this would be the game i needed to teach myself how to play. How wrong i was. It's not that this is a BAD game, i guess my complaint is more along the lines of the user interface. I'm pretty well rounded with computers and software, and even i was confused as to how to change games, change boards, difficulty, ect ect.I passed the game along to a few other people, and not to my surprise, they returned the game back to me after about a day reporting the same frustrations that i was having.All in all, i learned to play the old fashioned way, on a real board."
3,Salute to Anna Chancellor,"The movie has it's good and weak points. Amongst the good, a chewy meat-on-bone role for Anna Chancellor. It is good to see this actress flexing her talent. Imelda does no wrong...as usual. Andi...eye candy, as usual."
3,Fair movie...,"I thought the movie was good in a ""watch once but never again"" sort of way. The acting was decent but the plot had some slow points and the ending was dissapointing. Something bothered me about the way the story flowed and I still can't seem to put my finger on it, but I thought the movie was OK and held my interest the entire time, but I wouldn't watch it again."
4,Proper Headmistress Takes a Leap...into Love,"Crushis a delightful romp that reveals the bond of sisterhood between three forty-something women living in rural England. They get together, eat junk food, smoke, drink and commiserate...nothing could possibly break this bond. Right?Until one of them (Kate,the headmistress played by Andie MacDowell) finds unexpected love with a former (twenty-something) student. At first, the ""girls"" are amused; but then when it seems that Kate's feelings contain as much love as lust, the conspiring begins.Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor play the co-conspirators, who will do whatever it takes to get their friend back in the fold.Tragedy follows, and then comes a powerful disconnect between the three friends...But just when all seems lost, an unexpected blessing brings the three back together into their tight-knit bond, but with a new and fresh perspective.Somewhat predictable sisterhood flick...hence, the four stars.Laurel-Rain Snow"
2,"Okay movie, despite starring Andie MacDowell","I normally can't stand Andie MacDowell who always seems to be reading the script for the first time. But I have to admit that I liked this movie more than I thought I would. The 2 actresses who played her friends were excellent and ""Jed"" was amazing. He really captured the essence of the character and made you care what happened to him, which made the ending all the more affecting. I hope we see Kenny Doughty in more movies in the near future."
5,Jerry Burns - Angel,"I found the movie pleasent enough well written acted and directed, but I watched the movie mainly for the chance to here the Jerry Burns Track 'Angel' as the soundtrack album is so hard to get hold of. I was well rewarded this is a fabulous masterpiece of haunting emotional siren song that anyone who has heard anything else by Jerry Burns will hav ecome to expect from her. If you like this track why not get hold of a copy her debut album 'Jerry Burns' it may be hard to find but is is well worth it.[...]"
2,An odd movie,"Either Andie Macdowall was miscast, or the two friends weren't right - something just failed this movie. We wanted it to hurry up and finish because in the last 30 minutes, it dragged. Frankly, no-one would make up that fast with a conniving bitchy friend whose actions more or less resulted in the death of the fiancee. In fact, this is what spoilt the movie and helped it lose its credibility. Ok, there's a few messages in this movie, but don't bother with it, it's just plain rubbish. No wonder if went straight to video. And did I mention the unnecessary smoking that these women did in the film? It was VERY annoying to watch. Look for the scene where the Doctor friend smokes in the hospital while waiting for Andie's baby. A doctor would know better ???"
3,There is really nothing new in this film that hasn't been shown dozens of times before,"This is a trite film, as can be seen by summarizing the plot, without revealing the ""happy ending."" Three somewhat hedonistic forty year olds enjoy smoking, drinking, and telling tales about their male conquests or near conquests. They are very close and enjoy each other's company. Then Andie Macdowell fall in love with a boy that is only around 25, close to half her age. He does not fit in with the other women, nor with their friends. The two friends try several ways to bring Macdowell to her senses.What do they do? Is it anyway different than in other films? Will they suceed? What happens to the boy? What happens to Macdowell? The ususal breakupup of friends occurs for the usual reason. Will they get back together? Do we care?"
3,Interesting for mature readers,"Many adults seem to enjoy the book. Well, why not?? it resembles a soap opera. Being a high school student, i'm not very interested in that type of literature. However i must agree, it does contain ideas that will last centuries. Basic human flaws and sins (like pride and revenge) are represented in the novel. Overall, its a decent book, but specially for a mature audience."
3,Good design-not so good workmanship,"This is a very nice looking coat rack and I am enjoying its presence in my home, it is very useful, I'm glad I placed the order. However, it was a bitch to assemble. There were 4 grooves in which the legs were supposed to slide (tounge and groove), one of the grooves was not carved/drilled out properly and the leg did not fit. It was a real pain in the butt to get it together! Next time a little quality control please! Thanks"
1,no no no!,"The first three Roches albums (the Roches, Nurds, and Keep on Doing) from 1979-1983 are gorgeous, beautiful, genius. This fourth album from 1985 just goes down hill in a bad, bad way. Boring, unimaginative. There are a couple of highlights (e.g. Face Down at Folk City) but the album has little else to offer. If any of the Roches ever reads reviews of themselves on this website, I'm sorry to be so harsh, but take it from someone who has to listen to each of your first 3 records at least once a week! For the rest of you, go out and buy the first three today!"
2,a weak Roches album,"This album lacks the sonic focus and songwriting skills of the Roberty Fripp produced works. While the tone of the Roches have always been cute, they are starting to sound too cute for their own good. However, there are some chestnuts on this.""Love Radiates"" may be their best song of all time. ""Another World"" is good and ""Weeded Out"" is typcial Roches'... cute. It is a steep drop off from there. A problem may be that the sisters are very good musicians and musical arrangers. Their music works best in a stripped down, organic form. They do not need studio help!The problem with buying this cd is that their greatest hits compilation is so complete, that it encompasses anything off of this album that you will ever need. Therefore, this cd is for completists only.""The Roches"", ""Keep on Doing"" and ""Speak"" are clearly better works."
4,goes deeper than most CS courses,"Boolean algebra is the bedrock of computing. So if you want to deepen your understanding of computing, Brown presents this exposition. Beware. It is a lot more abstruse than the way Boolean logic is often taught in computer science courses. It shows a depth and elegance far removed from those treatments. There is a beauty here in the Boolean expressions that is sadly not appreciated by enough programmers.Along the way, Brown explains Karnaugh maps to good detail. He also ties this into programs that optimise Boolean expressions according to various criteria. So yes, there are actual code examples, just in case you think this is all too airy fairy."
2,Strident and depressing,"""Malen'kaya Vera"" opened in Russia in the late 80's, featuring the nation's first on-screen sex act between Natalia Negoda and Soviet heart-throb Andrei Sokolov (sort of a ""Leonid"" DiCaprio to Eastern teens). Picketers surrounded cinemas protesting it, decrying the morals-corrupting influence of depraved ""Western values"". Actually the sex scene is extremely tame by American standards. What made this film truly revolutionary was the heretofore prohibited portrayal of toxic family life, including grinding poverty, alcoholism, domestic violence, despair, and youthful rebellion. The film may be ground-breaking, but it is also ear-splitting in its stridency. None of the characters are likable enough to care about what happens to them. As other reviewers have mentioned, the acting is superb. The film accomplishes its goal, but it is enough to see it just once."
2,Milestone of Perestroyka,"I've seen this film long ago in the former Soviet Union when first video-clubs were officially opened. People wathed this poor quality tape about SU everyday life and at first so close the sexual act with Natalya Negoda as Little Vera in soviet film was shown. It is hard to imagine how great was the influence of this one scene to youth in country where ""sex was not at all"". Russian actors played great as always but such themes as alcoholism, relationships between children and their parents were shown in very heavy (""No future"") manner. For me it was enough to see this film just once."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Revolutionary for its time (I believe it's the first Russian movie to show nudity and feature a sex scene), Little Vera now is a sometimes-interesting take on the lives of two lovers in 1980s that now functions better as a piece of history than as a film."
1,Nothing special,"I remember when this movie first came out in USSR. I was fourteen and it seemed that everybody was crazy about this child of perestroyka. But the craze was not so much for the plot, but rather for ""let's show the world that perestroyka allowed us to show sex in our movies too!&quot...I personally didn't like the movie. Really nothing special, unless you would like to learn about life of working class in the last years of Soviet era."
2,It was big,"When it first came out in the movie theaters in Soviet Union, my mother wouldn't let me go to see it because I was 17 and suposly ""they had sex"" in the movie. Anyhow, I saw it and it was ok. Most people did talk about famous sex scene but I was more suprised how depressing it was, and how dysfanctional but yet common Vera's family was.I think it was one of the first attemps of Soviest filmmakers to show something different from traditional.It was a big hit as far as I can remember but I am pretty sure it is outdated by now."
3,"Good when first came out, now outdated",I saw this mivie in Russia when it first came out. It was one of the first films of its kind. Now it would only be relevant and interesting for very serious Russian cinema buffs.
3,An Ok Movie,"I agree with Inna ( who lives in my same town! ) that this movie is ok... Really, it shows a poor working class family's troubles, of which Vera is one of those troubles."
1,Why do you think they call it dope?,"My ex, Bobs, was strung out on this stuff for quite a while. He started out using it just on the weekends, when he would play with the Philharmonic Orchestra. Eventually his addiction progressed and we caught him in the music room at the local high school, licking the violin pegs and jonesin' like crazy. Our neighbor and retired DEA agent, Chompson, suggested that we do an intervention. Bobs was in rehab for almost two years and I visited him religiously once a month. When he got out he was a changed man. He took up cowbells and rigorously avoided all music produced by stringed instruments. After I left him for the butcher at A&P, I heard rumours that he'd relapsed; and now all he does is sit in the study with the shades drawn and listen to Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major over and over again."
2,Cheaply made,"This tool works, but it will fall apart a few times during each use. It's held together with o rings. So if its occasional use you want it's ok. Otherwise look elsewhere"
4,DOES WHAT IT SAY'S,Stretched the pipe so you could fit another into it. It didn't get five stars because you need another tool to straighten the irregularities in the pipe. I got 12 expansions and it still works.
4,"Good, but boring.","David Wulff's text, Psychology of Religion: Classic & Contemporary can be a bit dry at times. As a student, I felt at times that the content was difficult to digest -- not because of the difficulty of the material, but more due to the nature of the writing. Although I was very interested in the subject, I found myself having trouble focusing while reading.Although at times it's dry, it is still a very good textbook for students entering a Psychology of Religion course. Wulff (most times) does a very good job explaining the material. Most of the book is very clear, very detailed and thoroughly researched. I think Wulff did a good job of staying as objective as he could. Although he is a psychologist with his own views, all the other fields seemed to be represented fairly and accurately."
4,Delta TS350 Contractor Saw,"Well this is a nice table. Although, uunless I am missing something the blade tilts to the right not the left. SO if you are looking for the left tilt beware this is not left tilting. I did not buy for the left tilt so I was not so disapointed. THe table cuts very smoothly and accurately. The angle set is not super accurate so an additional angle guage would be wise otherwise your 45s will be 44.5 and 46.2 and everything but 45 on the dot.for the $$$ she is very sturdy workhorse and will do the job. If you are looking to make furniture get something with a better angle change and a better fence this is the bottom of the line (although there are many aftermarket addons that would make it much much better). [...]"
4,An excellent entry level table saw,"I'm a carpenter by trade, and this is an excellent saw to work with. You really can't go wrong with Delta, and if you've got a little skill there's really not much reason to buy anything in another price range -- unless you're running a cabinet shop full time.After a little trouble with the shipping company, I finally managed to get this thing to my door and drag it into the garage. Assembly is fairly simple if you've worked with a table saw before, but it's helpful to have another pair of hands available to hold everything in place while you're making adjustments.Just make sure you spray the table surface a couple of times with WD40, let it sit for a few minutes, and wipe off the factory wax coat. Recoat the surface with a wax of your choice (turtle wax you use on your car happens to work great) to keep the cast iron extension wings rust-free."
5,capable saw with plenty of power,"I don't know why so many people said it took them 6 hours to set up this saw. I had it up and running in 2 hours by myself. It has plenty of power for a weekend warrior but the lack of brake can be a little annoying as it takes this saw forever to stop spinning. The model a step down comes with a dust collection bag but with this one, you are on your own. Someone else mentioned a 1/4 inch of play in the back of the rip fence but I found it to be very sturdy and stable. I am very happy with this saw."
3,spend the extra money,"I wish I would have spent a little more it would have been worth it. I bought a dado blade only to find out that you can't raise the blade enough to cut a box joint in 1/2"" oak.Because of the way the table insert is made you can't buy a zero clearence insert and Delta doesn't make one. Why they bothered to make one for use with a dado blade is a good question. I have made a zero clearence insert out of 1/8"" plywood it works better than nothing. I made one for the dado blade the same way and it works.I wish I had bought the better Delta but it's to late now"
3,Spoiled,"Had to downsized from 3HP to this product so I am a little tougher critic than newbies. The back rail should match the front rail for length. The guard and splitter unit is flimsy and hard to get aligned with the blade. Jet allows you to push the guard up out of the way temporarily, Delta doesn't.Having said that, the saw is doing its job considering the price and free shipping. So, the value is great.Herb Mann"
5,sweet deal !,"Not only did i get the ts350 $60 cheaper than the ts300, it was delivered right to my garage door. I am extremely happy I read the reviews posted on the ts350 as well as the ts300 they were instrumental in my decisionmaking process.The machine arrived at 1PM and I had it put together by 2. The directions were easy to understand and all the parts were included. One suggestion to assemblers: flip over the rubber spacers below the blade cover plate to facilitate proper flushness to tabletop, a small dot of superglue applied to the spacers will also keep them from falling into saw guts during blade changes. Cosmetically, i would have thought they could get the front and rear chamfer of the extensions to match that of the tabletop. WD40 disolves the antirust wax on the bare metal tabletop. For a lifetime of rustfree use apply plain old turtle wax now and then, it's worked on my other saw for 20 years."
5,Great first saw!,I too picked up one of these at a local home center. I have an older Delta Unisaw and have wanted a secound table saw for some time and just happened into the store and saw this one on sale at such a good price I could not pass it up. I have been using it for three weeks now and am very happy with it. I would recomend it to any one needing a first saw or any one just wanting to get started in woodworking!Dwayne
5,guardians of the sun door,Very happy with the book! in excellent shape. Essential in order to understand the way to remember continallywhat is really necessary to the soul!
4,The Kid from Brooklyn,"This was almost a 100% remake of Harold Lloyd's The Milky Way years earlier. Danny Kaye, as usual, made it even funnier as a most untough lad becoming of supposed champion caliber in the boxing ring due to fights fixed in his favor, It's well worth watching for laughs."
3,ok,"I need protein in large doses. These pills are pretty big and they only have 1 g per tablet. Because they are so big, i don't want to take as many as I would need to make this buy worth my money."
2,PROTEIN TABLETS MADE NO DIFFERENCE,I USED THE BOTTLE OF TABLETS AND HAVE SEEN NO DIFFERENCE. THEY ARE VERY LARGE AND I HAD TO CUT THEM IN HALF. NOT SURE IF I WILL CONTINUE TO USE.
1,not my cup of tea,"This book was recommended in a book review column i always read and usually agree with. However the stories are very disturbing, strange, gross, sick and upsetting. I'm obviously not ready for this kind of book - i'm going back to Maeve Binchy.This was his first book - i wonder if he'll write another!!"
2,Disappointed,"I found the first story interesting....absurdist fantasy but then the next story was the same genre as was the next etc. etc. The two stars are for the use of language but the stories (do not equate it with the Canterbury Tales even though the dust jacket does) seem to pick something absurd, do something absurd with it and leave with an incomprehensible ending. That's fine in small doses but it doesn't add much to understanding characters or life in general. The ""plot"" device of 13 people stranded in an airport could have been something interesting but there is only one of the passengers who is given any identity at all so, an interesting situation is wasted and we know nothing of the people who are telling these stories. That would have added an interesting dimension.. Read one story from it and then go on to something else."
4,Odd little tales from travelers stuck in the airport,"It's probably too easy to just say Canterbury Tales setup (travelers telling their tales to each other, very different voices) with absurdist tales (Eugene Ionesco would be proud). There's more attention to the inherent absurdity of the setup than the Canterbury Tales or Arabian Nights would allow; a 747, a snowstorm, a baggage claim area, children of the stars, and consumerist culture. It's a fun, experimental book worth reading if you have tolerance for postmodern fables. Or a weakness for baggage claim story groups..."
5,This book has it all.,"If you are even thinking about raising ducks, you must have this book. It covers everything you need to know. It's well written and is hard to put down once you start. You can't go wrong with this one. Well worth the money!"
2,storys guide to raising ducks,"ok people >>> I knew nothing abought ducks But got 10 of them to raise.. had chickens .. so was not w/o some basic knowledge about fowl.. however I was really looking for far more basic knowledge then this book gives out .. you will find lots of info about types of ducks their ansectory .. breed lines .. how to of breeding and some general info about needs .. I needed something like ""duck raising for Dummies "" and di not think this provided it.So if your looking for that ,,THIS IS NOT THE BOOK TO BUY,, if your looking for something that covers Breeds and Breeding .. ASSUME YOUR PAST THE ""WILL THEY LIVE STAGE?' THEN buy it used you'll have good info .. .."
4,Great Basic Starter Book,This book is great for people just starting out in raising ducks. If your somewhat experienced you may not find any new information but the section on ailments can be used as reference. I personally could have done without the in depth slaughter section.
3,a little technical for the amateur,"This book has lots of good info., but I was hoping for more really basic duck help for the newbie, and instead there were pages and pages and pages of genetics, etc. I certainly found the book useful overall, but I wish it went into a little more detail on the most basic-type stuff."
4,Good quality,Very pleased with the quality of the book purchased and with the prompt delivery of same. Also was great to receive updates on the progress of our order.Thank you
2,where is the soul,appreciate the technical advice but found nothing you can't find on the internet for free -
5,good book,This book is very helpful and goes a little more in depth than the other duck book I bought. Doesn't have good pictures (black and white) but good information. Have used it as a reference many times.
5,A guitar master,I have always been loving Brent Mason guitar playing. And this CD is a must !Great music !
3,OOP,"I don't understand why this is out of print. I have only heard clips form this album and it sounds great. However, it is not an easy item to get."
2,basic and outdated,"The title of this book leads one to expect a wide-ranging summary of important electronic formulas, equations, and other useful tidbits. Given the reputation Mims has garnered with some of my colleagues who revered his works from their learning years, I bought it and was disappointed. There's just not enough content or modern material to warrant the purchase."
5,Great hand book,"I haven't even finished perusing this book, but it is a awesome quick reference to everything electronic. It is great for those who have electronic training, but need to brush up or look up something for clarification. It exceeded my expectations."
5,(NOT) The Worst Movie of All Time,"I honestly don't see how this could be rated the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time (behind ""Troll 2"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" the Worst Film in History). Besides the ""cheap for it's time"" special effects, I don't think this movie is quite bad, at all. In fact, I liked it. Although I DO think that part of the reason it's rated so badly is because this movie was actually intended to be serious, although it seems completely, 100% legitimately like satire or comedy. I'm willing to guess that's probably why it's called such a ""bad"" movie. But aside from that, if you go into this with an open mind and don't expect bourgeois film-critic-calibur greatness, you will be entertained.I also wasn't aware there were two versions of this DVD, but I apparently have the Image Entertainment one, and that is the right DVD."
3,Ed Wood is the KING of the B's,"If you are looking for a movie with great stars, superlative acting, special effects worthy of George Lucas and ""well coordinated"" lighting, as well as spacious and realistic sets, plus aliens with at least SOME kind of alien makeup job,THIS IS NOT IT.!BUT, if you want to get a large supply of popcorn, beverage of your choice, turn the lights down low, and remember the days when life was a lot more fun, gasoline was under fifty cents a gallon, and things were not as crazy, Then let EDWARD D.WOOD, JR, the GREATEST SCHLOCKMEISTER OF ALL TIME!, entertain you with the GREATEST bad movie of all time.THANK YOU, ED WOOD, for a great unintentional comedy..PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE..SEE it for the fun of it!."
1,Do NOT buy the Passport Video of Plan 9!,"As another reviewer mentioned, Passport Video has their logo ""PIP"" in the lower right hand corner throughout this DVD.Hold up your hand if this sounds like a good idea.Also, if you go to the menu and click on PLAY MOVIE (as you're likely to do) you'll not get to the movie, you'll get the INTERVIEWS. That's right Passport Video is a bunch if screwups!To watch Plan 9 you have to go to CHAPTERS.Avoid this disc."
3,NICE ATTEMPT AT A LOW-RENT S.E. CAN'T HIDE SHODDY EXECUTION,"Not that PLAN 9 was worthy of the Criterion Collection, but it deserved a bit better than the presentation Passport has given it. The transfer is slightly above VHS and the mastering is pretty bad. Hell, even the old VHS tape looked better. Granted, it's a film in the public domain, but couldn't you have found better materials? Worst of all is the company logo that plays throughout most of the movie - like anyone would rip it off!! However, Passport does try to make some amends by offering interviews with some of Wood's cronies and with ED WOOD Johnny Depp and Martin Landau, interviews taken off a 1994 press junket. There are also trailers for 4 other Wood films, and even if they too vary in quality, they are fun to watch. The film is the real star and is worth owning in any format. I just wish this one were better."
2,A watermarked plan 9,"Unbelievably, this DVD has a watermark (""PIP"") throughout the film! It's as though they taped it off the air! I returned it to Passport with a letter telling them to send me a pressing with the watermark removed, but have yet to receive a replacement disk (>6 months ago). I would advise waiting for another company to release Plan 9 and the remainder of the Wood collection. This is one instance where the DVD is inferior to the Laserdisk collection that was released a few years ago."
2,What the hell is up with this,"This was great movie! But this DVD is terrible. They got this PIP logo in the bottom right-hand corner through out the whole DVD. It's like watching the movie on a cable channel. The only things I liked about this DVD, besides the movie, is the interviews they have and the trailors. If they got rid of that PIP logo, it would be cool."
1,saw it in film class,"My film history teacher showed us this movie. No, he is not insane. He simply wanted to show us a bad film along with a lot of the good ones. And this is bad. But I would not spare my time complaining about that for this film is the definitive ""bad movie"". I just wanted to say that Lugosi is not in this movie so don't buy it expecting to see him. He has a couple of clips (well, actually you only see his eyes) but my teacher told us that he died two days into filming so they got another guy, supposably director Ed Woods' doctor, to fill the role. Also, he told us that throughout Ed's life he stood by the film never admitting that it truly was a bad effort."
1,PASSPORT VIDEO strikes PIP again PIP !,"Plan 9 PIP from outer space PIP PIP PIP is the classic PIP ""so bad it's good"" movie PIP PIP the only PIP PIP PIP PIP problem is PIP the PASSPORT VIDEO logo which PIP runs throughout the entire PIP length of this PIP Ed Wood masterwork PIP PIP PIP. The ""PIP"" logo PIP unfortunately becomes the focal point of the film early on and PIP PIP PIP ultimately obliterates any and all entertainment value. Not PIP enjoyable at all!!! AVOID the PASSPORT version!!!! PIP PIP PIP"
4,Plan Nine is a Hilarious Plan!!,"Plan 9 was one of the funniest, albeit was not intended to be so, that my family has viewed. Keeping the perspective was much easier by watch the comments from actors such as Johnny Depp about Wood's directing ability. Great and a must have cult film for sci-fi."
4,Trash at its best,"If you like B movies, stay awake late at night just to see them, and have good memories of your childhood seeing them, Plan 9 is a must have. It is so bad that sometimes I think it is a comedy.But if you want a movie with a good plot, good acting and at least a decent photography, don't loose your time."
3,kinda fun plan to see on screen...,"...or 2.8 stars, its continuity is decent using different visual scenes that makes it mildly entertaining enough (to see once or twice or so) i.e. saucers in l.a., in space, its space crew, its laser flashes, the 3 zombies, the army & other humans. this vhs had very bad blurry, nonsharp video quality."
5,Watch It At 2 A.M.,"In a nutshell, if you like bad B movies, this is the quintessential model - you must possess this movie at all costs and watch it with all your friends very late at night. If you don't ""get"" the humor in B movies, then stay away.Classic bad acting - classic horrid sets."
1,Good for a few laughs,"Detective:""It looks like the tombstone has fallen into the grave""Patrolman (in over-pronounced diction):""I guess that's why you've got the Detective badge""You can't deny it's bad. You can't deny that Ed makes you laugh with the ineptitude of the entire production. Vampira had dialog in the original script but it was so bad she asked to do it mute, so she has no speaking parts!"
1,...but five-star in terms of entertainment value,"I've read the other reviews, and none can completely capture the essence of ""Plan 9."" If you have not yet seen this movie, there is no adequate way to describe the numerous engaging faux-pas and blunders that make us all into Ed Wood Jr. fans. My advice: get a copy, invite your friends over, and watch it late at night while knowing each and every one of you could be either drunk or dead and come up with a better movie, but not necessarily more entertaining."
4,"""Plan 9"" bad, but not that bad","Overhyped as ""The Worst Movie of All Time,"" Ed Wood's film about space aliens trying to take over the world by resurrecting the dead should more appropriately serve as a table of content for all the bad horror movie cliches that were developed over it's time.Ed Wood's apparent claim to fame were his extraordinarily cheap production values, which complimented the bad acting and abysmal scripts. However, to say that ""Plan 9"" is ""The Worst Film Ever Made"" is now somewhat outdated. Trust me, there are much, much, MUCH worse films out there then this one. You have no idea...So, sit back, relax, and watch an incredibly bad but tasteful movie that even the kids can enjoy."
3,B/W SCI-FI FLICK FOR A SATURDAY NITE,"Aliens once again attack our planet. Only this time they re-invigorate the recently deceased to do thier vile bidding for them! Scenes in the cemetary are frightening enough, and the battle aboard the American spacecraft is amazing. The pre-schoolers who made this film must've been precousious."
5,"A Wonderful,Stupid and Magnificent Flop","I saw this movie over 30 years ago and fell in love with it. I think it epitomizes the black and white sci-fi genre at its worst and because of that it's delicious and superb. The movie is so poorly made, acted, directed and edited that all of that together really leaves you with the feeling that because there is no haughty pretense or arrogance like ""Day the World Stood Still"" you can veg-out and relax. Plan 9 is a classic and I hope it's never pulled from distribution. This thing needs to be around forever to remind us that movies can be made poorly and stupidly and still entertain us. I'm always inspired by this movie. Colour me stupid - go figure."
1,Flying Paper Plates over Hollywood,"This movie is as bad as you have heard it is. I can fully understand why Vampira asked to have all of her dialog deleted. But calling this movie The Worst Movie Of All Time is unfair. After all, Glen or Glenda is worse than Plan 9. This is Ed Wood at his best worst or worst best. Plan 9 is Ed's masterpiece!"
5,Plan 9,Purchased this to replace a VCR tape we had of this movie. A classic movie which is quite entertaining. This movies shows the lesser side of movie making.
1,worst movie,"This is said to be the worst movie ever. I don't know if I can agree because I've some pretty bad movies like ""Ape"" and ""Hobglobins."" As to putting the movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000, I don't know either. It's already really funny without anything said by Mike, Tom Servo, and Crow. But people should at least give Ed Wood credit for figuring out a way to get someone to finance this terrible movie."
1,so bad it's funny!,"This film is so horrible it's funny! It's well worth your time to sit back and watch the cardboard gravestones wobble in the wind. See the flying saucers made of paper plates. See the actor who replaced bella lagosi after he died mid-production. And if you can stomach the horrible dialogue you're a better man than I. So funny it hurts. Buy this, watch it with your friends!"
3,Whats the deal??,"This movie isnt nearly as bad as what ive been led to believe. I can think of many of the so called ""movies with a message"" and ""5 star gems"" to come out of Hollywood recently, that were much worse! Whats a few string suspended flying saucers, and corny dialog do to prevent this gem, starring not only Lugosi but the hottie Vampira, from being a true classic? Come on reviewers, you can surely find a worse movie than this. How about The Blair Witch Project or anything with Jim Carey?"
3,Plan 9 is a classic. But buy the 2 disk version of this DVD.,"The film: ***** The DVD: *I've just readed the Charles Varland's review. Too late, i think. But he express exacly what i feel.I boght this film with illusion, and the 10$ looks a good deal for a B-film. I thought it was the same editorial as the two disk version, but a cheaper one. But it is not.First, the screen is fullscreen. OK, I can live with it in this movie wich is not widescreen. But, what is that logo on the corner of the screen? IT IS A ""PIP"" LOGO ON THIS DVD! SOMEBODY PLEASE PUT PASSPORT VIDEO IN JAIL! I must admit that the logo is 70% transparent, but there it is, catching my atention. It's like wath TV.The other edition has better quality and better content. So if you love this film think twice or you lost 10$ first."
3,I can't decide whether this deserves one star or five...,"This is an utterly hilarious film. Sure, I suppose it's ""bad"", but that doesn't stop it from being utterly wonderful. It's all so amazing, it's hard to point out specific incidents. You've got to love the gigantic ex-wrestler with a thick Swedish accent as the police chief, you also have to love the way the ""flying saucers"" wobble across the screen (and, of course, the...um...damaged saucer, in which it's ludicrously obvious that someone set fire to the paper plate. And of course the scene when one of the diabolical aliens' gruesome undead slaves...GOES INSANE and starts trying to strangle one of them. And of course, who could forget the alien captain's dramatically charged condemnation of humanity (Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!). I've seen this film twice, and I'll probably see it a few more times in my life. An utter classic."
5,Plan 9 From Outer Space,"I purchased this film last year - after watching, I gave it to my brother, who also liked it. Decided it was time to get another copy. I recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation of ""so bad they're good"" films! Also goes well with what is considered the 2nd worst film of all - ""Robot Monster."""
4,So bad it is good!,"Plan 9 is absolutely bad...so much so it is extremely entertaining. An absolute hoot to watch with friends. I recommend watching it more than once because you will catch more flubs and screwups. From Tor Johnson's awful acting and line flubbing to the over the top transvesdite alian leader and the cheap set it is great entertainment from start to finish. The blue-ray version is perfect..vivid colors..a great restoration for the movie. Buy it, have friends over and whoop it up!!"
5,Put a little crimson in your soul,"There are several packages of Plan 9. I have a few my self including an earlier release contains 40 minute documentary ""The Ed Wood Story"" featuring interviews with Johnny Depp, Martin Landay, Dolores Fuller, Vampira, Bela Lugosi Jr., and Johnny Legend.Plan 9 is an operating system that is designed to replace UNIX. Oh yeah It is also a movie.""Future Events Such As These Will Affect You In The Future!""Due to their inability to make friendly contact with the earth government the aliens on the first 8 plans they must resort to Plan nine. This basically consists of reanimating the dead to become their army of conquest. Will the plan work?Due to low budget and the unfortunate early demise of Bela, Ed Woods has to resort to his Plan 9. You will notice that a lot of the scenes are done with curtains. Does his plan work?This would be a one star movie but because this is a must see to be culturally literate I gave it three stars."
5,"it may be the best ""worst film"" ever made","if you have never heard of this movie then i can only guess you are on the wrong page because this truley is the worst movie ever made,and the most fun you will ever have watching a movie ever. ed wood directs bela lugosi( two years after he died!!!) in this story of grave robbers from outer space. yes it's the worst but you can see that even though these people had no talent they tried as hard as they could and really it's a very funny comedy(even if it's not supose to be)and can give you and a group of friends endless hours of fun laughing and talking back to the screen. enjoy"
2,Plan 9 Bad: is Good,"This movie was terrible and I love every minute of it. It had a ""Hey kids, let's put on a show."" type of feel which made it fun. As far as being the worst movie ever made. That's probably still up for debate. There have been a lot of films made since then that have been pretty bad. Freddie Got Fingered, The Postman, Glitter, and Battlefield Earth to name a few. If you go in with an understanding of the story behind Plan 9 you'll enjoy the movie more."
1,"You're all stupid. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid! You're Idiots.","This is a perfect example to show what a low budget project can accomplish when the stars are dying, or the cast around you is aging. With the exception of the chiropractor replacing Lugosi, the cast shows what no training or expertise can contribute to movie magic! (I was kidding about the chiropractor)!"
1,we cannot keep this a secret any longer!,"I love Plan nine from outer space, and find it highly amusing, though I refuse to give it a rating any higher than one star, and in turn, ruining its well earned title of the worst film ever made."
3,Put a little crimson in your soul,"There are several packages of Plan 9. I have a few my self including an earlier release contains 40 minute documentary ""The Ed Wood Story"" featuring interviews with Johnny Depp, Martin Landay, Dolores Fuller, Vampira, Bela Lugosi Jr., and Johnny Legend.Plan 9 is an operating system that is designed to replace UNIX.

You will notice that a lot of the scenes are done with curtains. Does his plan work?This would be a one star movie but because this is a must see to be culturally literate I gave it three stars.Plan 9 From Bell Labs"
5,Worst movie ever,"I gave it five stars because it is indeed what it's famous for being. It's known as one of the worst movies ever made and I do believe it is. I can now say I've seen it and others may enjoy watching as long as they know what to expect - a truly terrible, cheesy, cheap 50's sci-fi flick."
5,"very bad , very good , very funny","I think there is a difference between a movie that is really good just made very very bad , and a movie that is just very bad. Plan 9 From Outer Space is actually quite good ..I was quite entertained by it...maybe it was the really horrible dialogue , the que card reading acting , the cardboard sets , the flying saucers painted silver with doorknobs attached flying via string , or that each scene turns from mightnight to day. Whatever reason it was I've watched it at least 6 x's , and I actually think it improves with each veiwing. I think movies like Moulin Rouge are the really bad films because it's junk filmmaking like that , that is polluting the minds of movie fans..not Plan 9..this film is just to sit back and laugh at or to watch with friends when you're bored. Definitly check this one out."
2,A mid-level good/bad flick,"Aliens come to earth, apparently needing better drapes for their uniforms. Celebrated/vilified as the worst movie ever made, it doesn't deserve that title (not if you've seen Red Zone Cuba, anyway) even if it does have oodles of fabulously wooden acting, as well as featuring director Wood's wife's chiropractor as the most unconvincing Bela Lugosi you ever saw."
3,"""You're so stupid! Stupid!""","Don't know how to exactly review this one, seeing that it's the worst movie ever made, but I'd give this three stars for sheer enjoyment. You'll laugh a lot, and it's real easy to make comments MST3K-style. Man, was this a bad movie! How can a filmmaker make this and truly believe its good? Ed Wood was insane! Notables: guy going around pretending to be Bela Lugusi (because he died during filming), the aliens' ""anti war"" speech, and the stupid monotonish dialogue of just about everybody.You'll love to hate this movie."
3,"Lame film, but fun if you watch along with ""Ed Wood""","This may not be appropriate in relating to another film that ties in with this entry. Stand alone, ""Plan 9"" hokey and ""B"" film quality. It was Bela Lugosi's last film (he died during production).My point of reference is the 1994 film ""Ed Wood"" starring Johnny Depp in the title role. Ed Wood directed low-budget horror movies and was a cult figure. The ""Ed Wood"" movie was basically about the filming of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and includes recreated scenes from that movie.Neither movie was exceptional alone, but watching one after another is educational and fun and is cult history. I'd rate watching the two together as 5-star."
2,Most valuable as a sign of how far movies have come...,"This is an old, very corny space attack movie. If you have been drinking too much and are in one of those ""everything is funny"" moods then this is your movie! If you are also critical of modern movies and need to see how far we have come, this also is your movie. For everyone else, not so sure..."
1,Worst movie ever made,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen that was intended to be shown at a theater. The whole ""Ed Wood was the worst director so you have to see this"" thing only goes so far. This movie was beyond bad. There were only bits and pieces that remotely appeared to be professional. The acting, story, scenery, special effects, and costumes were terrible. The dialogue was even worse. The lighting was even worse than that. Surprise, surprise, the makeup was good. No other redeeming qualities in this thing except that it's SO bad, you feel sorry for the director and for some of the actors if these were the best roles they could get. I guess if you watched it enough times then you may enjoy picking out all the lighting, dialogue, scenery, and acting mistakes. That's not for me."
2,A Very Boring Plan,"Plan 9 From Outer Space is considered by many to be one of the worst movies of all time. But it's also considered by many to be a camp classic. I was hoping I would be among those who would consider it a classic movie, because I do like campy films. Unfortunately, I found this to be a very boring movie. I might've laughed a handful of times. It's not near as much fun as many of the movies shown on Elvira's Movie Macabre. My bowel movements are more entertaining than the bulk of this film! Still, I've seen worse."
1,Plan 9 From Outer Space.,"Plan 9 From Outer Space,2004 DVD,In Color and In Black white,Legend Films, Plan 9 is in fact the Worst Movie I have ever seen along with che and fidel movies,and what hollywood usually tries to pass off as art,Oliver Stone films are horrible, But at least you know what you get with Plan 9, it's horrible yes,Bad editing,Acting,Directing,etc.But Vampira is in It,Bela is in it. and it's kind of entertaining to see despite the plot. I had to watch it being A Misfits Fan. And since it was $3.99 at the Big Lots Store. As for the special features,nothing really special about it, there is one called what happen to Plan 1-8 ? and one of them I found typical hollywood liberal stuff, shows Bush the Day of 9/11 doing nothing,so I wasn't amused, and of course Ed woods' lost films, where he is dressed in Drag(EWW) gross. what a weirdo. oh well."
1,It's sad,"It's sad that all of his life, Ed wood tried to make good movies, and they all sucked terribly. we were forced to watch this movie in school because it was a friend of mine's idea. If I was Ed wood, I would have tried to make the worst movies of all time, because I'm not so sure I could make the best of all time, but I could make the worst of all time. This should be the last time you ever think about buying. Curse you for thinking about buying this piece of garbage."
4,No Publicity is Bad Publicity,"This film proves that no publicity is bad publicity. This is definitely not the worst movie ever made, but it would certainly have been forgotten if not for the fact that it was labelled as the worst movie ever. The ample narration in this movie gave the movie a documentary favor which was probably intended. The special effects were cheesy, so what. The acting and dialogue were reminence of high school production. Some facial expressions were priceless. All these are indications that the movie was made quickly with a low budget, which it was. I liked this movie more than, say, The Hulk. I did not fall asleep watching Plan 9, which I did twice watching The Hulk.This DVD also featured a documentary about the film. The documentary was decent. It featured some of the actors and actresses years after the film was made."
3,Bad enough to be funny.,"Despite the fact that this is often credited as ""the worst movie of all time"", I found it enjoyable because it's laughably bad. As it still was entertaining because of its badness, I can't credit it as ""the worst movie of all time"". Plan 9 looks like something some freshman film students might put together with their non-film buddies as crew. I suppose in 1959 I may have felt different about it, but as an evening's diversion, I found this worth the time. Of course, I won't be watching it again and again....The title ""worst movie of all time"", in my book, still belongs to ""Dead Ringers""... which benefitted from a professional production crew and was just plain terrible."
3,not for reality,"not to be taken seriously, this farce was made famous by the movie: ""Ed Wood"" . The real Ed Wood was a genius who's abilitys were aborted by the new age of movies and their sophistication in the 50's and 60's. his sin was he was not able to keep up."
4,So bad it's good,"I ordered this title because one of the guys that I work with said that I needed to see the worst movie ever made. Don't be fooled. The story isn't as bad as a lot of people say it is. However, this is a full length feature. It's poorly shot and I found that the camera angles were slightly irritating. That said, any budding filmmaker or cinematographer should study this film for long looks at things they should never do.This movie is so monumentally bad, you can't stop it and/or look away. I watched it fully expecting to turn it off midway through. I watched it through and checked out the extras on the disc. It's interesting how bad Cecil Demented was. I wouldn't really recommend this movie for purchase, but go to Blockbuster and rent it. It's interesting."
1,What can I say about this movie...that isn't bad?,"Let's make a list of all the bad things about this movie. 1)It changes frequently from day to night depending on the scene. In the grave yard, it's always night, on the house porch early evening, and anywhere else, daylight. 2)The acting is horrendous, not to mention the script. When a woman's husband tells her he saw a UFO, she replies, ""You mean from up there?"" and gestures toward the sky. 3)When they show the UFO, YOU CAN SEE THE STRINGS! The list is endless. If you watch this movie, it's non-stop laughter, and this is a serious horror film."
3,Ed Wood's most memorable film,"Ed Wood took a great deal of pride in everything he ever wrote or directed and ""Plan 9"" is no exception. A great director? Not necessarily. A man with a passion for movie making? Absolutely, and that makes Plan 9 my favorite of his efforts."
4,Fun for anyone who loves bad movies.,"While it's not quite as funny as an episode of MST3K, Plan 9 From Outer Space will still have you rolling around on the floor, at least if you have enough friends around to make the laughter contagious! It's not the worst movie of all time, but it's close."
5,So bad it makes you laugh,"Yesterday I say this film on Swedish Television,and I laughed my way through it.I have never seen such a bad movie with bad actors,lousy special effect,horrible lines(Example:We know only know one thing for certain,and that`s that someone murdered the cheriff and that someone is responsible)and lots of bloopers.There are movies that are so bad they are actually very enjoyable!This is one of those.Don't hesitate to buy it if you like SF.Can you prove this has never happened?the man says at the end.Oh yes I can."
3,An Enjoyable Movie,"After seeing Tim Burton's Ed Wood, I felt compelled to see this movie, and I was not disappointed. This movie is absolutely hysterical in how bad it was made! But as bad as it is, that is just what makes it so good. Probably one of the most entertaining times I have spent watching a movie."
3,Worst Picture of All Time?,"Plan 9 From Outer Space has been labelled as the worst film ever made. Don't you believe it. OK, so it has it's faults, but it is truly a memorable cinematic experience. The script may have more holes than Tiger Woods's career, (no relation to Ed Wood) but it's as good as I remember it. You can keep your Star Wars. Plan 9 is what Sci-fi is all about. To really appreciate Plan 9 try watching Tim Burtons 'Ed Wood' starring Johnny Depp. Edward D Wood Jr, you are The Man!"
1,I am being extremely generous giving this movie 1 star,"Ed Wood should thank me. This hilariously inept supposed-to-be horror film isn't even worth 1 star. It's not even worth the shabby props or the sorry acting that can be found in this movie. Plan 9 From Outer Space has a classic reputation for being the world's worst movie. Even to the untrained eye, the movie mistakes in this film are gargantuan. It seems that there's a mistake every 10 to 20 seconds. Watch it... I cracked up during every scene. I certainly don't recommend this film for the Oscars. But watch it, I guarantee you'll find many mistakes"
5,Not a good film but a great unintenual comedy!,"I gave this 1 star film 5 stars because it was made on a buget of 500$. It was probably made by 2 people 1 to not think of some thing scary and 1 to think of somthing not scary. I prossed to prove my point with quote: ""THE BODY ROSE OUT OF THE GRAVE IT WAS THE GHOST OF THE DEAD OLD MAN!"" see what I mean. But it is a UNRATED movie but if your a up tight person it whould be a PG-13 movie but if your nomal it's a G movie."
1,Worst Movie ever!,"Ok. Seriously when I say worst movie ever I mean it. Nothing could ever be made that is as bad as this movie and if I ever watch one I will officially lose my faith in everything.But... Everone should watch this movie once. After watching this movie you realise that you will never, ever see a worse movie than this. You have hit the rock bottom and have no where else to go but up. I've seen it and I nwever have to watch this movie ever gain, nor will I. But I will let my friends borrow it, on the conditions that a) the movie gets back to me in one peice and b) they watch the whole movie. After seeing this everything looks better,"
1,Not worth the money,The video is not worth your money. It is poorly photographed; out of focus. The narrator is monotone. There are any number of still shots- in a video??? It is more a video selling the tourist areas related to the Amish culture then about the Amish. It was lousy and disappointing.
4,A Good look into Life in Amish America,"This film presentation is up close and personal. Through this film we visit Amish homes and recreations of Amish homes and go places that we have never been before.Of special interest is a home in Berne, Indiana where an Amish woman shows how she does her wash using ""Horsepower"" and sells bake goods which she baked in a wood burning stove. Other highlights include exclusive on-camera interviews with several Amish."
5,What can I say?,"Anybody who can give ""The Odyssey"" negative ratings, except for those criticizing the translation, have a serious brain defect. This is considered one the greatest books ever written, folks. No, I am not a tenured professor of English or anything like that, but to all of those students out there in high school or college, here's a story to which you can relate. I read ""The Odyssey"" in my sophmore year of high school and hated it. I never thought that a mere three years later I would come to appreciate this great masterpiece as much as I did. In my freshmen year of college I was ""forced"" to read this book for my freshmen English class and I realized how much I had grown up between the age of 16 and 18. Don't forsake this book. It is a masterpiece that will survive the test of history for thousands of years to come."
5,the zenith,"*The Odyssey* is, with the possible exception of the Bible, the most important work in Western literature. It contains every virtually aspect of what it means to be human while presenting us with the most complex character ever created. The fact that his only equals are women should recommend the book even more strongly to today's readers. Since *The Odyssey* is in many respects the first novel, I prefer prose translations, which also have the advantage of greater accuracy and literalness."
3,Mediocre Biography,"Maimonidies' two biggest contributions to civilization were his religious writings, and medical practice. As author Sherwin Nuland himself points out, Maimonidies' truest, lasting legacy are his religious writings. Yet probably because he himself is a doctor, Sherwin Nuland emphasizes the medical Maimonidies at the expense of not giving the religious Maimonidies his proper due. When reading this book, Maimonidies sounded like quite an ordinary man, nothing special, and the truth is, as a doctor he was nothing special. Yet in religious circles, he is a giant. This specialness of Maimonidies was lost in this short biography of this great man."
3,Dr. Maimonides,"Dr. Nuland ""biography"" of Maimonides focusses mostly on the sage as a physician, with much of the rest of his life sketchy at best. In fact, the first chapter virtually ignores the subject and instead describes the author's views on why so many Jews became physicians over the centuries. That being said, Dr. Nuland's book is well written, gives historical insights into medicine in the 12th century period, and is easy to read. I have not read any of the other biographies of Maimonides, several of which are cited by Dr. Nuland, and therefore cannot judge whether the paucity of details of Maimonides life presented other than medical is a intentional or the result of the actual absence of data."
5,Intriguing and informative,"All of Dr. Nuland's books are well worth reading. ""Maimonides"" is different from all of the other books I've read by him, in that it was narrative, and did not deal with a modern topic. However, it was extremely intriguing and informative. It gave a fascinating insight into both the cultural circumstances of that historical period, as well as into the personality and genius of a unique person. I believe that the author's special gift is to take complex and confusing information and synthesize it into a form which is not only meaningful but fun to read. I am reading Nuland's books more for inspiration and enjoyment than for anything else, and I have been extremely blessed by all of them."
4,Inside Prisons,"Michael Santos has written an important book for all Americans--but especially those who are concerned about the operation of Federal prisons and the lives of the prisoners. He takes us inside prisons at every level of the Federal prison system and tells us of his experiences in them. His information comes from his own journals, which he has kept since the beginning of his incarceration, and from court records of criminal acts which have occurred inside some of the prisons. The picture which emerges is frightening, with prisoners at the mercy, sometimes, of sadistic guards and prison officials, and of their fellow inmates. There is much which is wrong with the operation of our prison system, and it at last is possible to find credible information on which revised policies might be based. By writing this book, Michael Santos has made a valuable contribution to the prison system and to the citizens of this country."
3,Pretty Interesting Read... Good but not great,"A pretty interesting read. Good but not great. Prison life told through personal experience of the author and those of his fellow inmates. A somewhat superficial account in comparison to other inmate author books such as, ""In the Belly of the Beast,"" and the more recent, ""Fish."""
2,Hmmm...,"Well, I ended up skipping pages sometimes. It could have been a much better book. I think the writer should have wrote more about his own experiences, feelings and such. I was glad to get to the end of the book, although, I have to say that by the end of the book I really liked the guy.He is serving a sentence that is much too harsh for his crime."
2,So many better books out there,"I have read many, many books about prison, prisoners, prison life, not to mention some friends that I have in prison including a lifer or two. This is my least favorite book so far. I think the writer is trying to prove something about himself and goes way overboard with it. He writes things like ""...each man lives by his reputation alone, not by meritorious accomplishments"" wtf? I was bored from the first chapter and I'm still bored in the 7th. If you've ever watched ""lockup, lockup raw, or lockup extended stay"" then you already know all the stuff in this book. Don't waste your money."
4,Detailed look inside prison,"A very detailed and graphic look inside prison. I have not had any experience inside prison, just being a pen pal to prisoners. I read the book to get a better idea of what the people faced to whom I had written. If the reality is anything like this book, it is a very bleak place indeed. I like the way Michael goes through the various security levels and the aspects of each. Revealing."
4,"Weird, Whacky, and wonderful (sorry for the alliteration)","This wild, weird and whacky novel (17th in the Discworld series)features a collection of whimiscal (another ""w"" word) characters, including a dwarf, a werewolf, and a vampire dragon, along with several golems and humans. It begins as a murder investigation in a strange place called Ankh-Morpork. I would recommend starting with the Colo[u]r of Magic, instead of ""jumping in"" down the line, like I did. It might have helped me understand the characters better (thus, resulting in a fifth star). However, I look forward to reading The Light Fantastic and Guards! Guards! If one likes the late, great, Douglas Adams, or any of the other authors of this type, one might like Terry Pratchett."
5,Outstanding reader-actor on audio. Highly entertaining.,"Thoroughly enjoyable, laugh-out-loud funny. One of Pratchett's best novels. The CD audio version read by Nigel Planer is wonderful! Nigel Planer does an excellent job of giving zany voices to the zany characters. The reading is closer to acting."
5,Pratchett never dissapoints.,"I think that Feet Of Clay is a superbly written novel.Pratchett is a terrific craftsman of tales.I enjoyed this as much as I did the others. Pratchett has an exellent grip on language and I very much admire his style.He also has a very good ability of creating marvellous characters.If you like the Watch, you will love this book."
4,Forensics comes to Discworld,"I've always had a particular affinity for the Discworld books featuring Sam Vimes and his Watch. Whether it's Vimes, with his dogged determination to see justice served or Carrot, a true believer in the good in all (Sometimes they just need some help finding it and Carrot is always there with a helping hand and a werewolf girlfriend.), these characters seem to bring out the best in Pratchett. This one introduces a dwarf named Littlebottom who has been asked to leave the Guild of Alchemists and who is now brought in by Vimes to discover what's behind the white substance at the scene of a few murders and what's killing Lord Vetinari. With Littlebottom hiding a secret as well, this proves to be a great mix of an interesting mystery, a discussion on the nature of religion and free will and...golems. Have fun."
3,Okay,"First of all, let me get one thing clear: I like Terry Pratchett books. That said, this is my opinion.This is quite a good book, make no mistake. Some things may have a little more meaning to those who have read earlier Pratchett offerings, but in general, quite good.However, I do not really go for books that push the ""racial tolerance"" or ""anti-industrial"" lines. No anti-industrialisms in here, but racial tolerance coming out of the book's ears. Don't get me wrong- I'm not a neo-Nazi or something, but it does get annoying.Anyway: Terry Pratchett's Feet of Clay- good book. By the way, golems rule."
5,One of my favorites...,This is one of my favorite Terry Pratchett books. Funny and at times sad. This is the book that I usually recommend for people who've never read his books before (though I'm reconsidering that strategy at the moment).
3,Philosophy 101,"Terry Pratchett's humor is a little strained in this Discworld novel, but I found myself following these characters as though they were real -- not my usual experience in Discworld! Not that the setting is realistic, but the story, with golems and gender-confused dwarves, is underlaid with an exploration of autonomy and humanity that's surprisingly ripe with philosophy. I didn't love the book, but I liked it."
4,My Costume,"Other than the fact I had to exchange the costume once for damage, the costume is really cute. Thanks!"
2,"Great music, NOT REMASTERED!!","I must first say that LOVE AT FIRST STING is one of the greatest albums of all time. However, the description on Amazon claims that it is remastered; IT IS NOT! I own the original CD release, and this disc is no different--at all!! Not in packaging or in sound quality or EQ. Nonetheless, if you don't already own the music, I highly recommend buying a copy; great CD!"
5,Love at first sting for me!!!,this album rocks from start to finish!! I love this album and every song on it! if you love REAL rock n roll than you need this album!!!
4,Big Improvement,"This remaster is definitely worth picking up. A huge improvement over Deadly Sting. All the songs have an increase in sound quality, in all areas. The only flaw is some static, which is pretty much in the same places as on Deadly Sting. Great liner notes too, talking about problems in the band at the time, the demands of the producer, and opposition to digital recording. If you've never had this album before, this is the version to buy for sure."
3,it`s ok,"it`s not heavy scorps like earlier albums,and it`s not total cheese like later albums,it`s right in the middle,"
2,"Good Music, Bad Print","I am an old Scorpions fan, and always considered ""Love At Firts Sting"" one of their best albums of latter era. Actually, it's their last album with some original ideas, just like ""Flick Of The Switch"" was for AC/DC.I purchased this album when I started replacing my dust gathering collection of tape records made in 80's and early 90's, finally having decided to get some quality sound of my old idols. How great was my disappointment wheh I have heard this CD! The quality is quite similair to what I had on my old tape - low record level, high frequencies are not audible. In short - you've got nothing of Mattias Jabs and Rudy Schenker guitars, quite a little of Klaus Meine voice, which was good back then.I've heard Scorpions live this summer on private concert in Moscow: they performed mostly the songs from this album, and even given all those years passed, they sounded better."
5,Perfectly Balance Full Sound,"This is a review of the Audio Fidelity Gold version of this cd. The Sound is full, warm and nicely balanced. It sounds so nice that I have listened to it 4 times in a row at good volume with no fatigue to my ears. I think they have done a great job with this one. Please, give us some more that sound like this."
4,1997 remastered version,"I gave this version of Love at First Sting a four out of five rating. The songs on this disc are GREAT ! They deserve as many silly stars as one could possibly place upon them. My problem with this release is that it is being marketed to Scorpions fans such as myself who are expecting an upgrade in sound over the older cd version of this title. If this sounds like yourself, then don`t waste your money. There is no upgrade in sound. I don`t even think it has been remastered at all. I buy all the newly remastered cd`s that come out these days from my favorite old bands and most of them are truly remastered but not all. There is an expensive import version of this available that I was told has truly been remastered but I`ll wait until the Scorps redo everything and re-re-release it all again before I buy this disc for the third time.TDJ (Houston)"
5,Scorpions Still Sting!,Great classic tracks that seek to shatter the sunroof. Air guitar never felt so right!
4,Good ....,"The Scorpions are a very good group. While all of their songs here are good, ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"" stands out as their best, here. The other songs are good, too. Recommended if you like 80's heavy metal."
3,Scorpions reached their zenith with this one !!!,"Scorpions reached their maximum popularity in the U.S. with this recording, the fourth featuring guitarrist Matthias Jabs, who replaced the irreplacable Ulrich Roth. But, with Matthias, hte band worked even harder to obtain recognition from the media an the public, and it got it, deservedly. After that, their sound became purely commercial music."
4,Significant,"Very worthy recording by these German Rockers. Many of the songs are heavy guitar driven. However, there are some little ubtle touches that make this recording stand out a bit. One is the beautiful closing ballad Still Loving You. What an awesome tune from the lyrics on down to the singing as well as the guitar interplay. One of my all time favorite heavy metal ballads.Two is the dynamic guitar riffs that open up many of the tunes particularly the signature Rock You Like A Hurricane, Big City Night, and Bad Boys Running Wild. A third would be the gentle guitar pasage of Comming Home. Truthfullu I would have liked for that song to be a ballad all the way thru. A fourth stand out moment would be the drum beat on Crossfire. Very unconventional beats especially for a metal band.Nonetheles, Love At First Sting is onsistent throughout and is truly an enjoyable experience."
1,This remaster SUCKS,"I cannot listen to this piece of garbage. It sounds totally clipped, like they only wanted to use the top 2 digital bits or something. Maybe the responsible party didn't realize there are 14 more bits on the CD? Maybe they didn't understand something about the mixing chain? Whatever, it sounds really nasty, and I'm keeping my original copy.Barf!"
3,Good for your day off!,"I agree with the other reviewers. There are some ""fatal flaws"" but I don't do this workout enough to feel like I will turn out ""lopsided"" with only doing one side on a couple moves. I am very new to Yoga and I am enjoying dabbling in a variety of workouts and enjoy this one so far. I can see where it might end up being nothing of a challenge but for right now, I am enjoying finding new flexibility and do relax with any form of Yoga."
3,Nice & easy stretch,"I do like this tape. Its great for after an aerobic workout to stretch your muscles. It has two 20 mintute worksouts--I wish they were longer. I work out 4-5 times a week so I may outgrow this pretty fast but my mom would love it. Great for people who aren't looking for serious stretching/pushing but more like a short, relaxed, EASY stretching....I can't imagine this has any real phsyical benefits because the workouts are so short and so easy but it's a great intro--not intimidating or discouraging. I could do without all the giggling from the host though...trivializes it a bit...I do reccommend this as a short stretch video though!"
3,Yoga Zone with flaws..,"Unfortunately I have to agree with the other reviewers who already mentioned the flaws in this DVD. I'm a huge Yoga Zone fan but this one isn't much used in my rotation; unfortunately! The stretches and poses are great, if only they wouldn't be messed up the way they are!.."
2,Coulda been a contender,"Good instruction. Beautiful setting. If you do yoga regularly, this is a great, gentle way to start a longer practice. If you're a total beginner, this is good for you. 2 short, sweet segments.But, there's one big flaw -- in the second practice they completely skip a series of lunge poses for one side of the body. The right leg gets a bit of a workout; the left is completely forgotten. That's poor quality control in my book and I was very disappointed.So, if you're looking for something very easy and don't mind stopping and rewinding the tape during the second segment - enjoy. Personally, the Karen Voight ""Yoga Sculpt"" tape has two more complete practices with superb cuing."
3,"More of a gentle, warm-up video","The instructors are very knowledgeable and explain the poses, which is very important. I think that rather than use this as my sole daily yoga practice, I will use it as a warm-up for other exercising. This video is ideally suited to brand-new yoga practioners, rather than those who have done yoga for a while. Nice setting."
3,GET THE PACK INSTEAD,"Do not buy this DVD separately: as the other reviews explain, it is flawed and you'll get a better deal by buying the Yoga Zone Ultimate COllection, which includes this and 5 other DVDs. This is the first yoga workout I ever did and I liked it because it was easy to follow and the poses were very well explained. The instructors are wonderful. It is a pity there are some mistakes in the editing (some poses are done only on one side).All in all: good for beginners (this applies to the whole collection) but you'll want something more demanding if you already practice yoga on a regular basis."
4,Thoughtful and complete,"This is a well rounded review of the privatization of government. It provides a good backdrop for the analysis of alternative privatization schemes, while using anectodes to make the point."
5,great kit!,"This is a great kit. I was ready to get rid of my clarinet, because the one key suck all the time. I would take it to be repaired and they couldn't fix it (if you can believe that). But I bought this kit and all it needed was a little oil. Now it works great."
4,New Jersey Shore,"Being from New Jersey and often having spent time at the shore, this was a fun read. If you love the shore, read this."
5,Glory Days... Then and Now,"I have used this book as research for novels that I am working on. Never before have I read a book for research, and been so enthralled. For readers who like fiction, the narrative carries like one. Yet, for readers who like history, facts abound. This book is unique- and a great read.Murder 101 (Mystery 101)"
3,"Riding on ""the Boss'"" coattails","This choppy, although factually researched history of Asbury Parkis interesting. However, it ties itself to Springsteen (three references in the book title), as a way to sell books.The history of the rise and fall of Asbury Park could be that of any racially mixed, northeastern city...Atlantic City, Camden, etc. The topics of racism, religious prejudice, and fincancial greed are well documented. However, late in the book, the author tries to tie this in with the trite theme of popular music as a reflection of changing times. He then jumps to Springsteen - with little new information. The ride on Highway 9 takes a detour here."
4,Durable Placemat,This placemat has stood up to many scrubbings and is showing very little wear. The analog clocks up top and through the middle are very educational for my child who just turned 5. He now has a better understanding of what the small hand and big hand do on a clock. We didn't really find the digital clock portion useful on the bottom of the mat since the time on a digital clock is self-explanatory.
3,Naoki Kenji - Denshi Ongaku,"Nice electronic downtempo from Naoki Kenji. DENSHI ONGAKU starts off with ""Ongaku,"" which is a listenable but not outstanding. The next track, ""Poetry in Motion,"" however, kicks things up a notch with its instrumentation and relaxing vibe. ""Samishi"" has a fat bass synth line that gives it some bounce, while ""Mother Nature"" has a quiet Zen-like meditative quality. A good number of the tracks seem to flow by with no real impact, however; it makes it good for background music, but not for an intense listening experience. ""Liquid Pure"" is an exception, with its gentle ambience. ""My Destiny"" adds some vocals from Daniela Beck, which is a nice change of pace, though not particularly memorable. Still, pleasant enough."
3,cradle with seat,"I bought this for my granddaughter. A little difficult putting it together, wood isn't very sturdy, but she loved it...puts her baby doll in the cradle and her 18"" doll in the seat...plays mommy and baby doll. A unique concept."
2,Not what I anticipated,"I was so disappointed in this cradle after we got it together. Yes, it was easy to put together, but it was an opened package when we got it and was already missing 2 screws. It was so much smaller than I had thought it would be...the smaller dolls fit, but the 18"" dolls do not fit well at all. The rocking motion is very, very limited."
2,Not good enough,"I bought this book because I LOVE Rachels Cains Weather Warden series, but this one was missing something. I just didn't care what happend to the caracters. I finished but don't think I will continue reading the series."
4,4 stars,"What Jazz Callendar has worked for is now reality; her former police partner is now a free man, but Ben McCarthy's fresh start at life means more to her detective partner, Lucia Garza. Over the past few months, Ben has become dear to her. His release comes just as the Cross Society and the Eidolon group have begun turning up the heat on them. It seems like their benefactors want them and Borden, the Cross Society lawyer who is Jazz's lover, out of the game they play. Anthrax, knives, and psychological warfare are just a few of the punches thrown. Lucia and Jazz are on the verge of finding out how twisted the people they work for are, and how complex the plot they are in the middle of is.**** This is a fascinating book. If you enjoyed the Matrix, or if you didn't, you'll love it. Illusions and counterplots abound. You never know what will happen next. Reading this book will wake up your mind and keep you on the edge of your seat. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews."
1,DANGEROUS!!!,"This is a very cute and realistic set. The measurements are all accurate. The whisk is very DANGEROUS though. It is metal. One of the ""things"" came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon. One of the kids could have been severely injured had I not found it and thrown it away. If you buy this item, make sure get rid of the whisk!!"
5,excellent study aid,"Without a doubt this is an essential key to success in civil procedure. I basically outlined this book along with my class notes and got an A on the exam. Very, very, very good aid."
5,My professor REQUIRED this book,This book is very good at helping students grasp boring or dull concepts. I'm sorry but Civ Pro can be just that at times. This coupled with E and E make for excellent study help.
2,Not enough for the price.,"I admit I must not have read the info on this closely enough, but I did NOT realize it was just a flat fold-out like a map. I think the 'border' they put on the left deliberately makes it look like a small book and I am embarrassed to admit I felt for it. For that reason I don't really believe it is worth the money. However, it might be okay for a brief introduction to 'whet' your appetite, share with children, and take with you on a shore excursion from a cruise ship or other situation where space and/or time is limited and you are only likely to see the most common species anyway. If you are seriously interested in ID'ing birds or wildlife, spend a little more and get one of the newer field guides."
3,Average usefulness,"Pros: waterproof, highlights the most often seen wildlife, nice to have a basic guide to refer to, lightweightCons: Not comprehensive enough.We used this guide on our recent trip with an organized tour group to Costa Rica. We didn't want anything too heavy to carry and wanted something we could easily slip in a day pack. It is somewhat useful; we saw wildlife that wasn't included in the guide, but we saw a lot of wildlife that was included."
4,Short and usefull,I'm back from Costa Rica and I can say this booklet is a good resumé of what you can see in that wonderful country. On 152 differents species shown on the booklet we saw 16 of them. I will bring it with me on my next trip in hope to see more.
2,NOT WATERPROOF!!!,"There are two seasons in Costa Rica: the wet season and the more wet season. This guide, while useful, wicked water into the print and was wet inside my backpack. We saw and identified a number of species with this booklet, but there are also a lot more common species that aren't listed. Can't have it all in 6 pages! If you want detail, buy an actual book. If you want convenience, buy this, but don't get it wet."
2,"Costa Rica Wildlife, Introduction to familiar species","The sales image of the item makes it appear to be a small book, so I was a little disappointed to find it was a 1 page fold out. However, it's laminated and sturdy, and we actually did use it to ID a few mammals (already had the bird ID book).As a guide it's far too brief for the $5.95 price tag. However it was WORTH EVERY PENNY when at one point we were hiking through the rainforest, it was hot and muggy and I used this little guide as a fan! It's sturdy construction made it perfect. It was a life saver! Honestly, I was so glad I had ordered it."
2,Too skimpy to be useful,"This is effectively a foldout brochure (laminated) with only a few animals/birds, and very little information. You can get almost as much information from your general guide book for Costa Rica. I could only recommend this as something to give children to look at to keep them busy during the trip."
5,perfect pocket knowledge!,"You gotta have this little book of wildlife treasures on hand, because you will see most of these creatures if your visit is at least a week!Another book I read before my visit was ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made,"" one of the most imaginative travel-writing efforts I have read lately. Like an anthropolgical text with far too many tangents, it gathers the best and brightest attractions in Costa Rica to explore in essays the various themes of the country. This means that the selections are as diverse and strange as the points-of-view they represent. Standouts include ""House Made of Rain"" about a day in the rainforest, ""Why No Empire?"" explaining why the Spanish Invasion apparently skipped Costa Rica, and ""Women Under Tico Paternalism."""
3,Expected more,"This handy pocket guide has the most frequently seen species, but I expected a bit more. Handy, but not what I expected."
2,Pocket Guide Intro,"This booklet was offered as a bundle with another book I purchased. The booklet itself is well done, but not very extensive re: the wildlife of Costa Rica. It seemed to be a bit pricey to me, even at a discounted rate, for what I received."
2,Most disappointing,"The cover of this book gave me reason to expect that it would focus on the story of a family afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and the transmission of the disease through the generations. Instead, the majority of the book reads like a gigantic journal article. The author (a doctor) throws in a mere smattering of human interest here and there, but it's simply not enough to make the story interesting. I am not incapable of reading scientific writing, but page after page of it, as if it were a story in itself, is incredibly tedious."
4,Some killer versions,"The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star CD is the Everlast song. How lame is it to censor a supposed live recording? Other than that, this CD has some really great live performances. If you don't get to check out many concerts, or even if you do and want to remember some songs, get this CD."
3,Celia Knight,To start with lets say that this isn't a horrible album. But it isn't amazing either. I liked half the songs on it and the other half wasn't horrible but I just didn't like them for some reason or another.The quality varies from song to song and there are some edits over curse words but if one of your favorite bands has an unreleased live track on this album you'll probably buy it. I would suggest just buying a live album from the band instead of this one. I give it three stars.
4,Spaces Me Out,"I think that music like this does not get heard enough, therefore we don't understand it when we hear it."
4,Great for a beginner,"Some have noted this tape is not difficult and if you are in shape or experienced in yoga practice, this would be true. However, if you are new, these tapes are great. The instructors are down to earth and their cueing is excellent. They are very thorough in showing the proper form in which to do the poses. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is there is some editting which is obvious, but not disruptive to the practice."
3,Good for Fitness-Challenged People,"There are 2 20-minute segments on this DVD. On the first segment, the teacher is rather mediocre. The teacher on the second segment is good.This DVD is for someone who is older or has a low fitness level. I'm 21 and have a moderate fitness level, so I just do this one when I need a breather."
2,poor to average,"I found this tape extremely boring. I have being practing yoga many years and enjoy lots of different tapes, hard, easy. but this is simply boring. To much talking through meditation period, and not enough focus on abs. I can list lots of poses that he could have given to beginners. In my teaching years I do not recommend this tape."
2,Yoga for Abs?,"I love the fact that this video is filmed on the beach, but I did not feel this workout in my abs at all! I like Rodney Lee's Abs Yoga much better than this one."
3,$ticky Fingers,"Although I only did this tape once, I couldn't help but feel that Yoga Zone was trying to cash in on a trend with this tape. That's one of the reasons why I like yoga. It's always been an ""alternative"" kind of fitness regimen, and with this tape, it seemed as if it was churned out, to keep up with the ""Yoga Fever"" that's been happening lately.Still in all, I like the Yoga Zone instructors, and would buy other tapes by them."
3,natural lipstick,"i really appreciate the quality of the liptstick-being made with good ingredients and not all those artificial chemicals. the color was also pretty true to what you see in the picture, of course, i expected with my dark lips that it wouldn't pop as much as if i had lighter colored lips. with this expectation in mind, it was still a bit of a let down that for the price it didn't hold up at all. it rubbed off pretty quickly-i had to repeatedly reapply. all in all, even for the price i wasn't too dissappointed. maybe you might have a better experience and not eat like a cow like i do with the lipstick on :^>"
1,Poor packaging ruined product,"When I received my order it was totally destroyed. The entire book was torn away from the hard cover and all of the pages were bent like it had been thrown. I'm sure that, at least, the latter part was due to the under packaging of the product. Usually when I order books, they come wrapped in cardboard but this one was in a paper envelope which is probably why it was ruined when it came to me. It honestly wasn't even worth returning."
5,A GREAT BOOK,"This is a profoundly moving and important book, and I cannot recommend it too highly. Immensely readable and full of fascinating insights into the other ""nations"" with which we humans share this planet, it is also one of the very few books I have ever read which changed the direction of my life. For anyone who wants to truly understand this world in which we find ourselves this is one of the ""must read"" books."
2,Not safe for younger children!,"I gave this toy to my daughter, who loved it. The only problem was the nose. She played with it and the soft nose came right off of the hard plastic back that is attached to the toy. It is probably 1/2 inch in diameter with a cotton filling, which could pose a possible choking hazard to younger children."
2,Not a soundboard recording.,This is not a soundboard recording of this concert. If you have seen footage of the concert on television or elsewhere you are not buying the same quality of audio recording.
5,EXCELLENT DVD!!!,"THIS DVD IS THE PHATTEST DVD MONEY CAN BUY! THESE SONGS BRING YOU BACK MEMORIES AND MAKES YOU FEEL ALL ENERGENIC AND YOUNG AGAIN. THE GOOD PART ABOUT THE DVD IS, THEY SHOW ACTUAL VIDEOS OF THE SONGS FROM THE REGULAR CD. I WAS EVEN HAPPIER WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED JANE CHILD'S VIDEO ""DON'T WANNA FALL IN LOVE"". I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SEE THAT VIDEO AGAIN. HER VIDEO IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE AND SHE'S MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ARTIST. IF YOU FEEL HESITANT ON BUYING THIS DVD, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE THROWING A DANCE PARTY AND YOU WANT TO DANCE TO SOMETHING THAT WILL BRING YOU BACK IN TIME."
4,videos from back in the day,"it was great to see videos from when I was in junior high (actually 7th and 8th grade in a catholic school)...anyway, my only problem with it is the editing. Why did they decide to make the DVD sound like the CD instead of putting the album versions of the songs? The DVD has the same mixes that are on the CD."
4,EXCELENT VIDEO,"I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO CAUSE IT REFLECTS THE ESCENCE OF THAT YEARS LATE 80 EARLY 90 ,THE TWO VIDEOS THAT ARE FABOLOUS PAULA ABDUL'S REMIX OF KNOCKED OUT NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD IN HER GREATEST HITS AND THE SMASH HIT JANE CHILD'S DONT WANNA FALL IN LOVE A PITTY THAT SHE DIDN'T WIN THE MTV AWARD 4 BEST NEW ARTIST ......"
4,Wilding's Greek for Beginners,"Previous review of this text is unfair. I worked through nearly every Greek sentence in this book and found a couple of mistakes. What does ""FORMS ARE MISQUOTED"" mean? By implication, this text, which is a useful and competent introduction to the language, is dragged through the mud. It is pretty easy to recommend the monster volumes of Hansen and Quinn under the assumption that more is better. I found that students advance to serious reading of Greek quickly and enthusiasitically with this text. What is the problem?"
4,A great little book...,"for the teaching and learning of ancient Greek. Unfortunately it only covers the bare bones of the language, referring, as it does, to the less good Abbott and Mansfield ""Primer of Greek Grammar"". This book should not be allowed to go out of print, since it achieves its goal far better than almost any other work, with the exception of Chase and Phillips' ""New Introduction to Greek"". John Taylor's ""Greek to GCSE"" and ""Greek Beyond GCSE"" have appeared since I originally wrotethis review and provide the best basic introduction to Greek."
3,Not needed for true fans,"There's nothing wrong with this CD, per se. It does include Cinderella's best songs from the 80's & 90's. But I would think that those who like this group would have all these songs already. It's good to get a feel for them if one doesn't have their original releases. But there's no reason to buy this if you have their other CD's."
1,REALLY CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF CINDERELLA,"This really captures the essence of Cinderella: the worst kinf of glam ever made, along with Stryper, Ratt, Poison, Motley Crue, White Lion and other kinds of this terrible wagon which almost expelled completely the true heavy metal from American forever. Liste carefully to this CD. I think even Spice Girls are more authentic, because they are totally commercial, without disguising themselves as ""rock""."
3,All the Cinderella you really need,"If you are a casual fan of Cinderella, this is all you will ever need. ""Shelter Me"" is cool."
4,Only way to hear Cinderella,"Cinderella, like many other late '80's hair bands, have this problem with solid albums. You have those one or two big hits and the rest of the album leaves you high and dry!! This ""best of"" brings all the must have singles onto one CD. Early classics like ""Shake Me"", ""Nobody's Fool"", ""Gypsy Road"", ""Don't Know What You Got"", and my favorite ""Somebody Save Me!!"" 15 tracks in all that make you want to rock!!"
5,Great,It took me long time to find it. My son had one at his swimming lessons and he loved it. I decided to buy one so we can have at home and use ourselves.I am pleased with Sidekick - great price with free shipping. I would recommend it.
5,Just the right amount of chili!,Very tasty. I was worried that this would be too hot for some of my family but everyone liked it. Best with shrimp but it also works well with chicken.
5,To the review next to mine.,"To begin, this is only being given five stars because i have faith the pay per view will be great. Now on to the moron who decided to make fake predictions about matches that could never happen. You need to just shut your mouth. This goes out to you and all the idiots that like to make up events in a review section. Let people read something thats actually useful. Stop acting like a child and post your stupid fantasy crap somewhere else. By the way if they had gone with your dumb*** idea it would have been the worst pay per view in wwe history. I apologize for not putting an actual review on here but im tired of looking at a dvd and just seeing really bad ideas for pay per views. This is an attempt to end the era of idiocy thats plaguing amazon."
5,Promising Event,"Here are the official matches so far:WWE CHAMPIONSHIPRandy Orton(c) v JBL v Triple H v John CenaWORLDWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIPThe Undertaker(c) v EdgeBig Show v The Great KhaliHBK vs Batista w/ Y2J(referee)ECW TitleKane(c) v Chavo GuerrerroUS ChampionshipMVP(c) v Matt HardyThis years Backlash on ""paper"" looks to be way better than last years. I'm a big fan of Y2J, MVP, EDGE, AND ORTON so I can't wait. I wonder what the main event will be though since everyone knows that smackdown can deliver(Wrestlemania 24 main event was freaking awesome!). Anyway I'm not going to make predictions I just wanted to post the ""official"" match ups for anyone who wanted to know instead of putting a fantasy draft on here like so many others."

4,"It's a cable, and it works",It is only an av cable so there isn't much to say. I use it to transfer video tapes from an old Hi-8 camera to a computer through my Handycam. I wanted the s-video connection for highest quality. I gave the item 4 stars because it is too expensive.
5,Nice Cable,"Not much to say about a cable, but this one is well built and does the job well. If you need to hook your Sony camcorder to a television, this works."
5,AV cable for Sony Camcorder,"Hi quality, versatile. Because of S-video and RCA on the same end, I was able to connect the camera to 2 different devices simultaneously, which was very helpful in my particular situation. The 10 foot length is very nice also."
5,Good product!,"I use this cable to come out of a Sony HDR-FX7 for live video broadcast of athletic events online. I really like the extra length over the Sony supplied one. Plus, having the S-video addition is great for better video quality over RCA."
4,Love Cortes,"Always look for anything with Joaquin Cortes, dancing, acting whatever. This film is worth seeing just for the Granada scenery. It is interesting because it is about today's Gypsies and not some romantic look at the culture."
3,"Greatest KISS has some questionably ""great"" songs.","Talk about overkill!! What is going on here? Without a new studio release since 1992, KISS has offered up an Unplugged album, a live album, and now a greatest hits collection. With the obligatory ""new"" song (or rather, an audio clip of the opening reunion tour video for Shout It Out Loud), all that we have on Greatest KISS is another mishmash of makeup-era hits. Enough already! We're happy that KISS has reformed but with Smashes, Thrashes & Hits, Double Platinum, and the live albums, WE HAVE THE SONGS!!! I guess we can thank the suits at Polygram for this release because surely the band realizes that this is just too much. The label hoped to make a few bucks from the hype of KISS touring again. Plain and simple. Some good early reunion photos in the package though."
5,GREATEST BAND THAT EVER PLAYED,KISS IS THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLDMOST GOLD RECORDS OF ANY AMERICAN BANDS MORE GOLD RECORDS THEN BEATLESON THE ROLLING STONES FOLLOW THESE GUEYS
1,Call thjis there best?,"wheres ""heavens on fire""? ""i love it loud""? ""Lick It Up""? ""Domino""? and the rest????Dont bother with this album, just wait a few more years, and after the 90000th time kiss release a greatest hits album they might have one that is satisfactory enough to say ""greatest hits"" this album already has been released 3 times since with new names and covers and the tracks are all exactly the same!Gene and Paul sure must be rolling in the cash if this is how you make money by releasing a million GH albums that obviously wernt made for fans or in the intrest of actually making a REAL greatest hits album!Give it a few years and wait for the next 200 to be released before they decide to release a propper one. most likly after there 17th break up farewell tour!"
2,Again with the rehashing...,"It becomes tedious when a band continually re-hashes their back catalog to continually bilk fans of their hard earned money. The inclusion of a new version of ""Shout it Out Loud"" hardly justifies the band in their attempt to cash in on the moldy-oldies yet again. I cannot support such a blatant attempt at moneymaking, no matter how pleasing the artwork is or how tempting it is to secure that one random bonus track. It's not worth your money, and there is no excuse.Kiss...stop it. Please!"
5,new listener -- awesome album,"The first album I ever heard by Kiss was Hot In The Shade. Honestly, I did not care for that one. Thus, I was skeptical to purchase another Kiss album. I was looking for a retrospective, and I figured that this album would be The One.It was.From where I came from, I feel like I went from their worst material to some of their best. I love every track -- even the discofied tracks -- and the entire album simply rocks.If you are new to Kiss, this is the place to start. Great stuff.Recommended"
3,Pop Kiss,"The songs here suggest a softer side of KISS. Instead of some of their meatier material, you get ""Hard Luck Woman"" and ""Sure Know Something."" You also get the original ""Beth."" But then you get stuck with ""Flaming Youth"" and - for the gazillionth times - ""Rock And Roll All Night"" and ""Shout It Out Loud."" How much you really need to own this depends on how bad you want to have some of KISS's lesser known but still good songs, and how deeply you want to keep lining Gene Simmons' bank vault."
1,absolutely preposterous. Avoid it.,"The police arrest a healthy youngish man (without an arrest warrant) and take him to the police station to try to extort a confession to a crime he says he knows nothing about. Several hours later they deliver his body to his wife. He died in police custody from blows to the head.The movie is of the most incredibly stupid, manipulated I have seen in decades. The magistrate, though he considers himself brilliant and suspects the policemen (how else could the arrested man die?), does nothing to prevent the police murderers from tampering with the witnesses and evidence. In real life, a post mortem would have settled the issue once and for all.Don't waste your time on this trash movie."
5,absolutely wonderful!,"if you thought the SuperS anime season was good (hey! i did even if it DID focus a little too much on chibiusa) you'll love the manga. the storyline and art are breathtaking, even if the villians don't last more than an act or so. buy this! buy this book now!"
5,It rules I love Sailor Moon and now Sailor Moon Super S,This book Rules! I am a long time lover of Sailor Moon Anime and Manga! And since the Super S series isn't out on TV in America yet people can read this and get a good idea of what it is about!!Plus I love the Amazoness Qaurtet their outfits are so cute!!!!!!
5,I Loved It!!,First Charon is one of pluto's moons and if u did not know that u must not like pluto...Well...I love this series i got the whole series... but...they r way tooooooo exepencive --;;...oh well...there good any how.....if u r a moonie (a.k.a. sailor moon fan)than....well....u have to read thease!!!....so if u like sailor moon please read it...its about the dead moon circus and they try to take over the plant...LOL...its good dont wory...i havent read the first series so i have nothing to compare it to...but....i think they r all good 'cuz Naoko is a great artist!! ^_^...
1,"If you love the original Sailormoon, don't bother","Print quality doesn't compare to the original manga, the translation is... interesting in places... I just can't bear to read Mixxine's Sailormoon. They skipped SMS to SMSS, probably because it is so controversial (though it is the BEST.) C'mon, if they are going to skip a whole storyline, you KNOW they are going to make big mistakes and changes."
4,"I'm not a huge SM fan, but true Otaku will try anything ^_^x","Well, it was great to see them showing SM on the Cartoon Network, but it's horrible seeing it butchered and dubbed. I'm sorry, but even if you dubb it word for word, it just can't be taken seriously in english. I'm just not a big enough Sailor Moon fan to bother buying the tapes in Japanese, so it's great to have the manga. I must say they did a wonderful job of putting it in english. Better than they did on the show anyway! It's nice to see the return of the outer shenti's, and the SMSS manga really develops Chibi-Usa's personality, since she is more or less the star of this series. Too bad they had to flip the manga when they brought it over (As all otaku's <and probably some DBZ fans> already know, Japanese reads from right to left, like hebrew)..."
3,Les originals sont bien meilleur! ( in French),"If you like this one, you are shur to love the original Mangas . This book is like the long vergine of the mangas.Mangas=18books and this one only neads 5 to tell the storie.But mangas have a lot more pictures!They were boath good! Its up to you to discid! Bye! snif!"
2,I cant figure it out,"I cant figure this book out wat the heck?! It has no words (well some but they dont count) only pics! Dont buy it if you dont like pics!It seems to be about a strange girl named Bunny and a strange girl named Sailor Moon I cant figure that out, its about 2 difrent things?! And a strange girl with the strangest name and Rini what the heck yuky name! Sailor Chibi Moon, wierd name! and these people say weird things. Dont buy this."
5,Exellent,"I would like to say that this book is exellent! Expecially the people in america that don't have all the anime shows. Well, if your are in america and you don't know alot about sailor moon don't get this book. It takes place in the fourth session of sailor moon. I, for one, liked this book.I liked it so much beacuase it showed the seen where bunny and rini swicth places!"
5,It gets even better!,Sailor Moon is the bomb! I love the beautiful artwork! If you like Sailor Moon get this book!
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS!!! THE BEST MANGA SO FAR!!,"I love Helios!! He rocks, as well as the rest of the Scouts. Chibi-Moon has the best appearances in this one, especially when she and Bunny turn into each other! It leaves you wanting more and more. THIS BOOK is worth every penny!!!!"
5,amazing manga!,"i own the japanese version so when i got this, i could understand what was happening! its not dubbed like the tv series so you know whats really going on.+ GREAT illustrations ! 10+ manga!"
4,A fun and interesting book!,"This book was the first Manga I've read. It's practically my only source for finding out what happens in the Super S season. I can't wait until Vol.2 comes out!! The story started out confusing to me since I had never read Manga, but after a while the plot hooks you! A really neat interesting book. Moonies, get it! Especially those who want to know what happens in the undubbed seasons! I think all of you will agree with me, THEY REALLY NEED TO DUB MORE EPISODES!! ^_^"
5,thank you for the book,"Thank you for having a copy of this book and for such a low price. I've been wanting to read this series for awhile but I could never find it in a bookstore. Also Thank you for shipping it so efficiently, it got here so quickly, within the time mentioned. I cannot thank you enough and merry christmas."
3,Old Fashioned Sewing and Faith,"The magazine opens with a letter from the publisher and a Bible verse. If that's going to bother you, find another magazine.This magazine has some nice techniques--smocking, heirloom sewing--but if you aren't sewing for children, then this IS NOT be the magazine for you. In the magazine in front of me, ONE article isn't about sewing for children or children's toys. The other issues have been the same. I'm cancelling my subscription today. It's not a bad magazine--it just isn't at all what I ws looking for.If you are a Christian and want to sew heirloom stuff for your children or grandchildren, I would highly recommend it. The kids' clothes are cute if sometimes old-fashioned or impractical. The instructions are clear and well-illustrated. There is a free pattern in every issue--for children."
1,Waste of money,This does not talk about JAXB at all. What it talks is about some non standardised APIs that existed before JAXB.The brief mention of JAXB ( 4 pages ) is only philosphical. Even that is w.r.t. an obselete version with DTD support.( Current JAXB only supports XML schema )
1,Confused and poorly edited,"I hope that Robert Adams's narrative voice got clearer and more organized with his later books. This one is full of illogical jumps, cuts, and lacks of transition. I keep getting confused while reading, because he suddenly changes place or time without the slightest attempt to let the reader know what's happening."
2,Not Casual Reading,"A pseudo intellectual recommended this for our book club. Others voted for it because they liked Lolita. This was the hardest book I have ever had to grind through. There are sections that are beautifully written but the majority of it dragged on and on. At the end, I asked myself, ""Why do I care?"" I dont think you should."
2,Might be good if you're a Russian Lit. scholar.,"Thus far I've read all but maybe 2 or 3 of Nabokov's novels. This is the first one that I've quit reading.The first half is OK. There's actually a story. Then, suddenly, without warning, you're thrust into (I'm guessing) the main character's work about some Russian writer, who may or may not be an actual writer for all I know. From about the half-way mark, to where I quit (about page 240 out of 300+), it's all literary/poetry criticism, references to countless Russian authors, various philosophers, etc. It's like a boring dream where you drag on and on from boring meaningless sequence to boring meaningless sequence, always wondering if it's the narrative of the main character's book, or Nabakov. This was just too much.It might be fine if you're a Russian literary historian, but for regular folks, I just can't recommend this one. I gave it 2 stars because it's Nabokov, but only for those precious few good sequences in the first half of the book."
5,Coming of Age in Exile,"I found this ""coming of age in exile"" novel of VN's to be an exhilirating, long read. The sensibilities developed in this final Russian novel of VN's are multi-layered and alternately opaque and transparent. Oftentimes this book appears to be going nowhere and then a passage appears that transports you into another of Nabokov's magical perspectives where human imagination informs the universe! I've enjoyed the pace of the text and found it to be a book worth savoring over an extended reading. Criticisms about the books apparent ""plotlessness"" are not based in any Nabokovian context. Careful reading, sirs and ladies, is the way to proceed. The reading is the thing! Take the gift as just that."
5,"Prose, Fiction At Its Best","""Among the best prose stylists of our century..."" goes the complement to Nabokov's fiction. You know what, he is still among the best prose stylists in this century, the 21st. A must read. Yea that sounds hackyneed by now. Too bad it has been wasted on less writers. Read this book. Don't buy into snobby readers advice, even Nabokov's own advice, so when you find yourself wanting to skip a few parts in the beginning do it... You'll come back to the very first sentence and reread (""all readers should be re-readers..."" up until the point that made you say wow."
1,Wrong items sent!,"I ordered 3 Peek-A-Boo Clear 920, I received 3 sugar coated 900. The envelopes with the lip gloss identified each as Peek-A-Boo Clear 920. Because it was cosmetics, and the item is not sealed,the so called easy return was anything but. I did get my refund but it took a lot of time on my side."
1,Clay,It was the consistency of clay. The Peak-a-Boo color has great a great consistency. Won't purchase again from this company.
3,sticky,I bought 2 different shades of this gloss. It is sticky . Does anymore reccommend a sheer lip gloss without the sticky that has a clean flavor that is very budget friendly. I'm looking for something lighter weight and silky.
5,must see,Love this movie.. I consider it the final chapter of fma before brotherhood...recommend it all the way. It gave me closure to this wonderful series
2,Eh...,"Some would say I am a pretty big FMA fan. From the pocketwatch to clothing to even seeing a bootleg version of this movie about 11 months ago. I must say that I was disappointed. The ending of the movie ruined the WHOLE FMA series for me. I don't want to put in any spoilers (and I won't) but the entire movie was good up until that ending. It's happy in a sense but just wrong, way off track, and bad for the cannon.Now, leading up to the ending, this movie is pretty good. The story line of Ed was boring in parts but was 'creative'. It was really fun seeing Al in human form! Took a bit to get used to but when he fights, he fights better than Ed in the series.I adored this show. But if I had my way, I'd go back in time and not watch it. I'd rather have it end as it did in the series."
3,Not so much...,"This movie takes place mostly in a world where alchemy -does not work- which kind of defeats watching an ""alchemist"" movie."
2,Why do they do this????,"Why didn't they release this version the same time as the non-limited edition? I just bought the original movie release. If I had known about this upcoming version, I might have waited.It's bad enough that many movies get re-released a ridiculous number of times. But to sneak this in for a first-time release is just wrong. Anime doesn't get the kind of free media coverage as mainstream titles, it's wrong to expect that fans are all going to do the extensive research necessary to find out pre-release dates for curveballs like this.It's time to stop marketing DVD product with the assumption that everyone is rich and doesn't think about how many copies of the same title it is sane to own.BTW, the movie is very good but not a perfect ending to the story. For the most part it rose above the level of extended TV episode, but FMA's standards for ""TV episode"" were high to begin with.I hope there's more to come. And that it's marketed better when it does."
4,Not to shabby,"Ive been a fan of FMA since the first episode i watched. As the series story became more unraveled and you meet all the characters you found out new and different things. But out of them all, im a fan of the flame Roy Mustang. The beginning of the movie was a good start to it but as you watched more of it there was more twist and turns to it. But in the overall end it was pretty good."
2,Almost,"It is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach. The movie does give you a conclusion for the anime. There is little to laugh at in this movie, the directors are to focused on making their point. They have decided to make the anime and movie more ""real"" than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be ""realistic"" have created inconsistancies that can not be explained.The music and animation are excellent. But I would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie."
4,Will we see more of the Elrics?,"Though I personally don't think this movie was quite up to the standards that the TV series had, it is still a very good continuation of it. Good charcter development, advancing plotline, all the hallmarks of a masterpiece. My only gripes with it is that the villians in this one are not very smart, they have nothing on the 'Shepard of Sins'. And the charcters were made OOC at times just to advance the story-line. I really don't like the fact that the 'Flame Alchemist' after everything he went through gave up on becomeing the Furhur, and abondoned romance with Hawkeye. It could have been just a good a story if he had stayed in Central and become Furhur, or at least was still trying to do so!"
5,alchemy and nazi's,"What could be better than alchemy and nazi's....this animation was awe inspireing...There was never a point where the vivid colors,not to mention imaginative story line, was lacking...I recomend this movie to all those with enough forsight to enjoy a few twists and turns into a new world beyond the tv series"
4,Perfect end for a great series,"While it's true there are some areas of the movie which lack and should have contained more, and the main 'bad guy' was a little on the flaky side, overall I found it to be the perfect ending for the series. Some fans are unhappy that the imagined relationship between Ed and Winry was never to happen (and never will happen). Tough luck I say, as the series was never about that fluff to begin with, it was about the brother's journey together and it remained true to that all the way through. The end of the movie really helped the series come full circle. My only wish it that it had been much longer!"
3,Don't expect too much from this title,"Fullmetal Alchemist - The Conqueror of Shamballa is the conclusion of its remarkable 51-episode TV series. Familiarity with the TV series is required prior to viewing this movie.Animation and Japanese voice acting are both outstanding. The only flaw I see in this movie is its ""Evil-Conquers-World, Hero-Saves-World"" plot which has been used in countless predictable anime shows. The movie slightly lost the unique quality that the TV series had. Despite the complaint this DVD still deserves a space in your FMA DVD collection because it still had the action and drama of the TV series."
3,Not a stand alone movie for sure!,I've heard and read quite a bit about the series and had high hopes for this movie. However I was disappointed to a large degree. The artwork is not terrible but doesn't set the standard. The story is ok but you'd have to be a serious fan to get into it. It has a few flashy moments but that's about it. Despite being on blu ray it still looked dvdish due to the artwork. Non fan shouldn't waste the money.
3,Another Cash-in for Funimation,The best version of this movie is the Collector's Edition set that comes with lots of extras as well as what's already included on the disc. This Blu-Ray version is quite good with the enhanced sounds. You won't notice the difference in video quality due to the fact that it is an anime - and it's very hard to compare the DVDs and Blu-Rays of older movies/series. A BUY for fans.
3,review,"box came a little damaged (not senders fault though), looked like defect from whoever made box. Came wrapped brand new! however shipping was fast and on time. GREAT MOVIE for the fma fans out there. something i recommend for those of you wanting to keep the anime collection going"
4,Interesting continuation,"This feature is a good way to get back in touch with the characters that made the FMA series amazing. It's interesting to see how they adapt to their changed lives. The Nazi storyline was very Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but still entertaining. Overall, this was a satisfactory follow-up, with the only real negatives being that the whole story felt extremely rushed, while some sequences dragged on."
3,FMA movie is okay,Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie - The Conqueror of Shamballa. This movie takes place after the second (and final) season of FMA. It ties up loose plot ends but not in a satisfying manor. There is more action in the movie than the series - to the detriment of the movie. The graphics and sound are good as always but the plot does not engage the viewer as deeply as the series. The ending of the movie pretty much ensures that there will not be a sequel. I gave the first and second seasons of FMA 5 stars but this movie only earns 3 stars.
5,Amazing Film for the end of the Series,"If you have watch the original series of FMA I really recommend you to watch this film at the end of the series. For the people who have read the manga and have not seen the original series you might not get the story or what's going on. It has great special features as well to see how the film was made.One of the best Anime films for a series I have ever seen.So as I said if you have seen the series and not the film, don't think just get it."
1,"Watch the Seris, Not the movie.","Watch the Series, not the movie. This movie was honestly horrible. I honestly think if you are a true die hard fan of the series, there isn't much to like in this movie. There is zero character development of the villain. Envy is a dragon wtf? All principles of alchemy are ignored. What a joke. I have no idea how people rate this movie 5 stars? I can only think that half of them haven't watched the series or something. HUGE disappointment!"
5,A quality addition to FMA,"I purchased the entire series of FMA on Amazon as well as Conqueror of Shamballa on Blu-Ray. I made sure to watch the series before popping the movie in and was glad I did. I loved the movie. I'm not sure if watching the series is necessary before watching the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I didn't. It's a great addition to the show. The Blu-Ray quality is apparent with some gorgeous visuals. The US actor commentary, talk session, and making of in the special features are pretty good. Overall the movie was solid, same talented voice work, interesting story, and the Full Metal Alchemist vibe in all its high-definition glory. 5 Stars."
3,"Okay, but doesn't compare favorably with the actual show","This is, generally speaking, an enjoyable movie. It does provide some closure to the series (that's as close to a ""spoiler"" as I'll get). But the series itself was such a cut above most anime that I found myself disappointed with this movie.Basically this is about as good as most decent anime movies. If you're a fan of the show, you'll probably want to see it; but don't set your expectations too high. If you haven't seen the show, this movie won't make much sense. If you're not already an anime fan, this is NOT the movie to get you hooked."
2,disappointment,"I was disappointed. The end totally disregards the feelings and hopes of all the characters in the main series besides the Elric brothers. The movie did not have the philosophical edge that the show did, though it tried to. While the show was thought provoking, the movie felt preached to the audience. In the end, I would adivise not watching this movie because it is a let down and you'll like the show more if you don't."
5,Great movie that leaves you wanting another movie,Great movie that gives you another adventure of Ed and Al but still refuses to give you the resolution you want.
3,Magnify Him With Bibleway National Choir,"The album is great. It has the early 80's Gospel Sound also with a little Funk too. I love the songs on it. Stand-out songs include ""Magnify The Lord"" and ""I Can't Stop Loving God"". The album is well-worth buying."
5,an eminently readable treatment of Boston politics,"""Liberty's Chosen Home"" is a thorough and well-balanced treatment of the politics of violence in Boston. Using the busing crisis of the 1970's as his central theme, Lupo elucidates some of the various ethnic conflicts which have plagued Boston since its founding. Lupo's status as a prominent journalist and a political insider allows him to provide the reader with a unique, firsthand view of the events he details. In addition, his familiarity with the vagaries of Boston politics enables him to draw remarkable character sketches of the players in these same events. For example, his analyses of Mayor Kevin White's upbringing and administration are penetrating. In fact, these discussions of White are more insightful than those in the far more celebrated, ""Common Ground"" by Anthony J. Lukas. While this latter book has garnered a great deal of attention for its wide scope, Lupo's book is no less an achievement. Highly Recommended."
3,Don't Bother With This One,"Don't Bother with this one. The lighting is poor and the presentation is not smooth. Also, many brand new copies are being offered at $1.99 each. This is not a good sign.Live Concert (334/4)"
3,Neil Diamond:The Roof Party,"The music and performance are excellent! The lighting is terrible and, in general, the video seems very chopped up. It just doesn't flow."
4,"Great Driving Shoe, but not a Great Slipper","The heel is kind of narrow, due to its design as a driving shoe. Because of this, the shoe is a bit unstable for my liking. It's very comfortable while I'm sitting at my desk working, and also great when driving, but if you're thinking about using this as an around-the-house-slipper, (as I was) you should look elsewhere."
5,Exceptionally comfortable.,"Like wearing a moccasin only with more support. More supple than most Driving Shoes, and light weight too. Soles wear very well, as do uppers. A Great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe, yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in Southern Cal."
1,it's a piece of ...!!,"The examples are very trivial in this book; most of them can't be compiled. It only works in theory, but not reality. If you want reality and you are reading this book, then you are wasting your time."
1,Average and TOO much mathematics,"The initial sections of the book focus on too much mathematical formula without providing plain English examples especially in the asymptotic analysis sections. Isn't there a book out there which explains in plain simple English? It also uses misleading terms like ""external nodes"" and ""internal nodes"" when it comes to trees. I wouldn't recommend this book. (I'm only using it because it is the university text, now I wish I had my money back)"
2,"decent for soft eng, bad for data structures","As a second year student, the use of design patterns (see chapter 5) bothers me. It really detracts from what the author is trying to convey. It's extremely hard to ignore them because you have to backtrack to previous chapters frequently which creates more confusion.This book may be useful to learn the basics of software engineering. But given complexity of the design patterns in this book, it could be glossed over in one lecture...."
3,Not so much in quality,"I know this book is used as a textbook in some computer engineering courses at my school. However, I do not belong to engineering, but I am a computer science undergraduate. :-) I've tried to help my friends who were having a lot of trouble implementing a binary tree. So to follow what they learned, I've looked at the book. Hmm. I sat there, and said ""I'm lucky that my profs don't teach me algorithms like this."" Some implementations did not make quite intuitive sense to me. Although I understood what the book was trying to illustrate, but I didn't see why such implementation would be intuitive and useful."
4,A good little phone.,"I got this phone just because I needed one. I wasn't particularly looking for this model but it was in my price range at the time. My last phone was a Motorola. I have had Nokia's in the past and now I have no idea why I ever left the brand. I have found this phone very reliable and love the fact I can receive radio on it. Whenever I have to walk somewhere etc I can play the radio and still have one ear listening to what is happening elsewhere. I have found the battery life to be amazing and many times I have misplaced my charger just because it has been so long since I had to charge up my phone. It doesn't have a camera however which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But if you are like me and rarely use the camera you will not miss it. I love the fact it is tiny, compact and light. It is a great little phone."
3,Great Phone - Lousy Belt Clip,"I purchased this phone for use as a cell-phone only. I had no need for all the other fluff ( mp3, camera, etc ). Along with the phone, I purchased the Nokia made, belt-clip.The phone was great. It's battery life was remarkable and would never seem to get low. Everyone I talked with was impresssed with how good the audio quality was.You notice one thing in the above paragraph. Everything is discussed in a past tense. I had the phone for less than one month. The phone came out of the belt-clip while I was driving in a rental car. I still have the complete 2-part belt clip ( anyone want a cheap belt clip ? ;-)Nokia, shame on you for allowing such a bad design to go into the public.I liked the phone and may buy another and would recommend it to anyone who desires a good basic phone. Just don't buy or trust the belt-clip."
1,A BIG ZERO!,As a movie it is horrible. It is like watching a road runner cartoon. Very corny and cheesy. The power rangers cartoon is more realistic.
4,A Tiger of a movie,"I would rate this movie second tier. Very good but not the best. It was a great plot - about half action and about half romance. Both Katrina and Salman handled action and romance scenes equally well. The music video was great, especially Mashallah and Banjaara, but there were not enough songs. I liked the way that they utilized the music styles of the localities - Ireland, Cuba and Middle East. Although not on a level with Wanted and Partner this is still a very good movie."
4,Ek Tha Tiger,I was a great story line. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It kept my attention to the end. I would reommend this to others.
3,so so plot!,easy entertainment! But hardly anything to write home about this move! Exceptional seller! Love story is a love story. this movie is a sale of a popular actor!
4,Great live performances. Awesome artists.,WAAF is the best radio station. They play the best music around. This Cd was put together very well.
4,"Waaf-great station, good cd","Waaf is the best rock station in the state of Massachusetts. Anybody who thinks wbcn is better...well see if you can find any bcn cds. Waaf has lots of live preformances, and I think it's a good idea to put the best ones on a cd. get this even if you have never heard of the radion station if you like good, live rock music."
4,Good for beginners,"Good cd for those beginning yoga; good explanation of moves and poses. Nice scenery and music. Not real challenging for anyone who has done yoga very long, but nice sequences of stretching and perfecting basic yoga skills."
3,"Okay, but not what I consider to be a Power Yoga video","I love the Yoga Zone DVD's but this particular one is somewhat repetitive and there is no challenge to it - even for a ""beginner"" Power Yoga DVD."
3,DVD,"Just like the title reads this is an ""introduction."" First 20 min. of 40 min. very basic. Second part of work-out much more like a power yoga work out for beginners with out the sweat. Great for someone who has never done a yoga position. I bought the boxed set. If I were going to purchase just one of the DVD's in this series, I would purchase the Yoga Zone Total Body Conditioning instead."
2,decent instruction,"You won't want to do this routine more than twice. VERY basic, won't work up a sweat. Go with Rodney Yee or the other Living Arts DVDs."
3,"Could have been ""more""","I liked the first part of the practice better than the second, because I felt the first part was more strenous and challenging. I wish the whole tape had equal intensity. For that reason, I prefer ""Yoga for Weight Loss"" and ""Yoga for Strength and Endurance."""
2,Not for beginners,"I've taken a yoga class and used a Lillias tape in the past. I bought this tape as an alternative for my wife and daughter, who are beginners. The presenters go through the series too fast, not allowing sufficient time for paced breathing. They also do not do as good a job as Lillias in describing the movements so that you need not try to watch the screen while doing the postures. Some of the postures are helpful, but you need experience and some review of the tape before you can perform the sequence easily."
4,Love and good music--what more could you want?,"I have to admit that the mystery part of the book was pretty predictable. Still, I liked the main characters, and the music aspect was a nice addition. Both the hero and heroine are musical, and that is what draws them together. I liked the book for the way the author showed why the lovers were attracted to each other and what kept them together. These characters show up again in another book, My Lord Footman. This book doesn't have a deep plot, and don't expect the usual regency fare of the ""London Season."" There were a few emotionally ""harrowing"" moments towards the end as an old mystery is solved, and long-held beliefs are shattered, but it still was a pretty ""light"" read overall. This one went on my keeper shelf."
1,Why ?,"It's not actualy porn and it's not actualy an entertaining movie. I must have missed the point. No story line, no romance, no reach around. I usually have good things to say but this was a poor investment."
4,"""New"" Fan Thanks to BLACKOUT","I recently purchased this album because I have seen the No One Like You video (both versions) a lot on VH1 Classic lately. The only other Scorpions albums I had prior were Humanity and Moment of Glory, and I'm of course familar with their other big hits.Well I was pleasantly surprised by Blackout! I ""discovered"" the gem that is Arizona! It is very catchy (which I like) and seems like it should have been a ""hit""!No One Like You of course rocks, everyone's heard it. I really enjoyed this album, its thoroughly and consistantly good. Very METAL! So after that I purchased Love at First Sting. I thought I would love that album as well, thinking it would be a progression from Blackout but I'm disappointed in that one! I won't get into that review here but I have to say Love at First Sting makes Blackout sound that much BETTER!"
4,Easily the Scorpions best pure metal album.,"Right from the start the Scorpions as usual hit hard. They show their gratefullness to thier fan in ""can`t live without you"". They show their love for a good love song in ""No one like you"". They show their roots as one of the most anti-nuclear rock bands in history in ""China White"". Don`t believe me listen to it."
4,"This is good, indeed!","The album has some frantic hard rocking tunes like ""Blackout"", ""Now"" and ""Dynamite""; some melodic rockers in the shape of ""Can't live without you"", and softer tracks like ""No one like you"" and ""You give me all I need"". You also get a good typical Scorpions ballad in ""When the smoke goes down"" (a formula the band used several times later). All in all, this is a good rock album and it's not as commercialized or polished as the following ""Love at first sting"". This reminds of a time long gone by and it's a pleasure re-living the past, when heavy metal was king on the mountain."
4,Fast and Hard hitting Scorpions!,"First out, although this isnt Scorpions best album, its surely one of the toughest. The energy just seems to burst out of every second, and although Klaus Meine had undergone an operation right before the album he sounds just awesome. He prooves his newfound power with the memorable title song ""Blackout"", which also is the best song on the record. Other highlights on this album is Arizona, When the Smoke is going down and You give me all I need. The other songs are generally good, and there is no bad songs here. However, this is not as good as Love at First Sting, which combines the best elements from both cd`s, hard and fast hitting songs with great melodies.I wasnt sure wether or not to rate this 5, but since it lack the perfection of Love at First Sting, It will have to do with a 4. A STRONG 4 however, as this is very, very good Scorpions as we all love them."
5,A MUST HAVE EARLY 80'S HARD ROCK MASTERPIECE,"This band played at Anaheim Stadium on July 17th, 1982 with Iron Maiden, Loverboy, and Foreigner(who was headlining). When they opened with Blackout, and then screaming and glass shattering at the end of the song, it was so loud and awesome that it really got the crowd into it! I still have the concert T-shirt. Can't Live Without You has to be played right after Blackout to get the full effect. Dynamite is a cool song, and Arizona is too. No One Like You is good, but it got played too much on FM radio. Check out the CD with Rock You Like A Hurricane and turn it up!"
3,"It's still pretty good, after all these years","This is the Scorpions' Off the Wall. When Michael Jackson hit his peak with Thriller, it was interesting to go back and hear the previous album. When the Scorpions hit their peak with Love at First Sting, you could go back and hear this, the album in which they were clearly trying to figure out how to reach the largest possible audience.On Blackout, even the missteps are pretty good. You Give Me All I Need and No One Like You are prototype power ballads with a little too much power. That makes them more interesting than anything on Love at First Sting. And songs like Blackout and Now! are a lot of fun --- garage versions of Rock You Like a Hurricane.It helps that this album sounds so good remastered. It's really tight, but too old to be as slick as anything produced today. And they didn't throw in any extra tracks; I just want the original album, sounding good but without weak bonus tracks."
4,great,"The guitar riff opening the titlle track is just unforgettable. Amazing. The CD is good,e ven the ballads, but ""CHina White"" is awful, one of the worst Scorpions songs. The rest is first-class material from Matthias Jabs' phase."
1,Not Remastered,This title is not remastered. I purchased it to replace the original which I have two of now. Anyone need a copy??? Otherwise a great album. China White rocks! Great band to see in concert do not miss them.
1,Going downhill fast........,"I gave the Scorps one more chance after the major disappointment of Animal Magnetism, & I'll tell ya, disappointment went to utter disgust, with the music & lyrics going backwards & gettin' more immature than ever, but good for the intended 12-14 yr-old market. I said 'goodbye' to the Scorps then and only listened to Lovedrive & all the ones before....-then awhile later, I heard ""Rock you like a herd-of-cans"" on the radio & it only cemented my belief that they sold out to commercialism & the big bucks, with any serious hard-rock songwriting tossed aside--oh, well, at least they got the big bucks! (but not anymore of mine)"
3,"Blackout- thier best ""80's"" output","I would say Scorpions took a nose dive artistically when they went into the 80's with Mercury. This nor any other Mercury era record cannot compare to what Scorpions did in the 1970's. However i still think it is a pretty decent pop/metal album, certainly better the ""Loverdrive"" or ""Love At First Sting"". The energy and ""metal-ness"" is much higher here, even though it boasts some inane lyrics. When compared to any of the Roth-era material however, this is sub-par."
1,Failed the test of time.,"Really liked this album when it came out, but was really disappointed when i re-bought it on cd.It's dated, and Klaus Meines voice is more annoying than i could remember.Stay Clear!"
4,Good MP3 Version,"The MP3 quality of this record is of decent quality. I love me some Scorpions and this record takes me back to my high school days. The tune Arizona takes me back to a school trip that ""really was a gas, mind blowing all the way you know - just out of sight."""
4,Scorpions at their best,This album is straight out the top drawer. German metal doesn't get better than this.
4,"A miniature perspective of life in ""modern"" Japan","""Middle Heaven"" is where we are, where life with all its complications is acted out, regardless of whether it is in Japan or somewhere else in Asia, the complexities are the same. It is a very moving book about a Japanese woman (Tomo) who faces life's struggles after the 2nd World War. I guess it must have been difficult for most Asians especially those having experienced post-war traumas to adapt to the somewhat ""new"" democratic plans, i.e. giving up one's own understanding of culture and traditions and making way for such ideas as equality, women's rights, etc. in a patriachal society. One is forced to examine oneself and come to terms with one's own identity. It is interesting to discover that in this book, Tomo is able to bridge the difficulties, especially after the earthquake, and comes out triumphant, despite the complexities of the Japanese society."
3,Not a good place to have doubts,"There are at least 2 confirmed wrong answers out of 202 so far. It does not make me feel confident that there aren't other errors.Given that rules and regulations change, so I tried searching the company web site to see if there are updates but couldn't find any.The exam isn't interactive so you wouldn't get any computer practice from the CD."
2,Should be better than it is,"A bit outdated. You're buying a PDF of questions and answers. It was last updated in 2009 and some of the numbers have changed since then. Still gets the basic points across. It is helpful, but the test has changed recently and the PDF hasn't. Just know what you're buying. They give you an option to download the product, which is nice and saves time."
3,Only one of its type,"Finding published information on Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF) is somewhat hard to do. Other than the official site at www.microsoft.com/mof, this seems to be the only ""book"" available. It is definitely a pocket book, and is basically a cut and paste from the whitepapers that you can get for free from Microsoft. So if you need it to fit in your pocket, then get it, otherwise just get the introduction to MOF whitepapers from Microsoft web site and print them out. Being a pocket book, it is also easy to lose it. Ideally I would like to see a ""shelf"" paperback book in the similar vein to the official ITIL Service Management books, as the MOF information is a great companion to any ITIL project."
5,Keep it in your pocket,Excellent pocket guide! The authors did a great job. I now approach IT Service Management from a different perspective now that I have discovered MOF.
5,A+++,This is my favorite of Dianne Day's books. I enjoy history and the experiences of Fremont Jones during the great earthquake makes that experience more real to me. The development of Fremont and Michael's relationship moves forward. The other characters that are introduced are interesting and well developed.I recommend this book highly to everyone.
1,Absolute crap...,"I had to read this book as part of a Masters-Level class on organizational management. I would offer it up for sale, but I intend to burn it when class is over. Unless you want to read a book written by people who are SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU ARE (he said with an extra helping of sarcasm), do yourself a favor and skip this book. It a bunch of religous, self-righteous, fairy tale dogma. Horrible, horrible book. Will look nice when it's burnt to a crisp, however."
5,Wow! Awesome. Made me cry.,I was so surprised about how this audio book really touched a nerve with me. I loved it. The story telling was compassionate and insightful. Wow.
5,Unexpected Excellence,I was surprised how engaging the story/message is in this book. Very easy to read and carries deep thoughts that provote the reader's mind. I highly recommend it!
2,Nothing New,I read this book cover to cover as a requirement for a master's level class and found it to be a real snooze. I can sum up the whole book in one sentence. Treat employees like people; give them respect and listen. Now you don't need to read the book; it really is nothing new.
1,Saccharine for the Soul,"First, a disclaimer -- I'm an atheist, so a book that regularly refers to concepts like ""soul"" and ""prayer"" wasn't perfect for me.That said, as a former partner in an international management consulting firm I've had to wade through many poorly written management and advice books. Among those, this stands out for being particularly vapid. The conceit of being a work of fiction that teaches allows the authors to ignore the need for research or data. The fictional account also allows them to avoid taking any repsonsibility for presenting alternate viewpoints or expressing doubt.Most management books have a theme that could have been confined to a ten page article, which the authors instead run out to 200 pages to make a book. In this case, the messages of ""more to life than work"" and ""treat employees with respect"" would have better been presented as a five paragraph essay.Nice cover photo of the woods though..."
5,An Invaluable Reference,"This is an excellent work and an invaluable reference of Islamic law. It is has the certification of Al-Azhar University and the International Institute of Islamic Thought. The author is an American convert to Islam who produced this work with the help of Islamic legal experts from both Damascus, Syria and Amman, Jordan. It's particular emphasis is the on the Shafi'i school of Islamic law and it has many other useful appendixes and footnotes that expound on the other three Islamic legal schools. It is truly a masterpiece and I highly recommend this work to anyone who wants a detailed explanation of Islamic law. You will not be disappointed!"
4,This little book!,I had to order this book twice! The delivery was super fast. When I received the first package I was super excited until I discovered that the package was empty (no book). The seller credited my account within 24 hours so I could order another one. I received the next package within 2 days. Anatomy and Physiology is tough but with lots of studying you'll do fine. This was a easy read and the study guide has fun and helpful activites
3,Micatone - Nomad Songs,"Micatone goes for some straightforward jazz with their third album, NOMAD SONGS. The delicate ""Mars"" is like a torch song beamed in from another planet, but it's not until ""Out of the Game"" that the full-on band comes on in all its guitar-strumming glory. Lisa Bassenge's voice takes center stage going from fragile and wounded on ""Where I Am: Part 1"" to the breathy exhalations that become part of the percussion in the slow, groovy instrumental ""Nomad"" to full-throated belting on ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (That's The Way It Goes)."" Her voice mixes with other textures, as well: ""Trouble Boy"" has some slow, loping reggae, while ""You've Taken All"" has a mysterious, spy quality to it. There's also a few unexciting tracks. For instance, ""D-D-D-D-Dance"" should be more thrilling than it actually is. But the tempo-shifting ""Circle"" gets the jazz back on. NOMAD SONG will be a album I'll wander back to now and then."
4,Excellent tool,Has good torque and is easy to use. Meets or exceeds my expectations. I had a little trouble with the phillips screwdriver bit.
5,A very good movie.,A surprisingly good movie. I was unfamiliar with the the plot and it had a good surprise in it. Recommended.
4,A Very Good Woman,This movie was not what I had expected. It turned out to be a sweet and yet sad story... I recommend it if you need a movie to just relax and enjoy.
3,Just okay,Helen Hunt seems like she is just reciting her lines. She is not convincing in this role. The rest of the cast seems to fit much better.
2,From Soup to Pizza.,"Piero and his poor poor family eat nothing but thick flour soup and chopped tomatoes. After hard work and a family argument, accidentally pizza is created. ""Dammi u pizza!"" which means 'Gimme a piece' in Italian ends this story with an explanation that no matter rich or poor, everyone can eat and enjoy pizza. It is also a cute story to read to a young child who is curious who created pizza? This book is wordy, repetitive and lacks dialogue. Illustrations are basic sketches with water color."
4,Don Gibson's Hits of the 60's,"This double CD called Anthology holds the Don Gibson Hits from 1958 till1969 which is just the half of his carreer although the best part of it.It also holds his own versions of songs that other singers scored bighits with like Ray Charles, Ronnie Milsap and especially Roy Orbison whodedicates a whole album to him and that every Roy and/or Don Gibsonfan should own. It's still available on a double CD called Roy SingsDon Gibson/Hank Williams The Roy Orbison Way. These are incredible coverversions as if Don had especially written them for Roy.This double CD is of the best quality available and therefore the bestDon Gibson compilation one can obtain."
4,Joli,"Très belle compilation de cet artiste de country-music qu'est Don Gibson qu'on entend souvent parler dans les compilations. Beau programme, cela s'écoute avec un réel plaisir. Continuons à distribuer du Don Gibson."
3,not as good as upon a moon dark moor (prequel),"This book was predictable in many arena's (hero and heroine). You don't really know the hero as you do in it's prequel , ""Upon a Moon Dark Moor"" (that is a good one, if you like Wuthering Heights type hero's and heroines).This book was only ok because it had the previous characters, Maggie and Draco in it and I wanted to learn more of them. The hero as described in this book was not given enough written space to seem interesting, unlike Draco(UaMDM). The herione was shallow and immature as previously stated. Disappointed"
2,Did she really write this?,"Terrible book. There was virtually no coherent story, the heroine was a twit, and the hero was one-dimensional. If you like a good story, and a somewhat intelligent read, then DO NOT buy this book. Brandywyne writes such good story that it is hard to believe she wrote this book."
1,bad idea,"i heard rave reviews about this book but it dissapointed by it, i mean from start to finish we see this heroine as a stupid and immature child-woman, i hated this book but the rape scene just pushed me way onto the top, if you want a good read AVOID this book."
5,An insightful and enlightening world view.,"A must read for anyone concerned about the future of humanityand the planet. Tells the story of Creation and the historyof the world and the lifeforms that evolved here, from thepoint of view of an eyewitness. Includes prophesies aboutthe future, as well as an explanation for why we have createdthe mess we've got today. Will expand your world view andleave you with a sense of wonder, a broadened perspective,and lasting hope for the future. --L. Kashinn"
4,Other Council fires were here before ours,"I love Jamie Sams style of writing, and she opened many doors that were closed lifetimes ago.Other Council Fires Were Here Before Ours: A Classic Native American Creation Story as Retold by a Seneca Elder, Twylah Nitsch, and Her Granddaughter, Jamie Sams"
3,A Great Gift!,A great tool to help understand twelve important issues of the Bible. Affordable and easy to read which makes it a great gift for anyone.
5,Recital De Guitarra,"You definitely get your money's worth with these cd's. They are both so soothing, they put my toddler right to sleep, which is just an added bonus. This music is beautiful, intricate & totally enjoyable."
4,Recommended book,This book gave alot of interesting information of the colonial houses in Williamsburg. The pictures compared with stories are werry enlightening. A good book to read for all who are interested in traditional american architecture.
4,Great Coffee Table Book,Beautiful pictures. Always a book of discussion when visitors find this book displayed. Lots of great info on one of my favorite East Coast destinations.
3,Not his best,"Given earlier works, I had great anticipation for this book. Sadly it did not meet my expectations. It IS a good book, just not to the level of Howard's others."
5,Love it! Great Read Aloud!,"This is one of our family's favorite books! We read it to our boys ages 4 and 2. They love it! It is frequently quoted at our house and will be one that I keep in our family library for when we have grandkids someday. It is just that fun of a book! ""Oh no, won't do, gotta shoo, but who?"" Love the rhythm in this book. If you like good ol', down home, country type settings and can read this book with a dramatic flair that gives a sense that you are on your way to a picnic in a country town or the ""north 40"", then this is the book for you! Oh...and I probably also love this book because I say crazy words like ""schmuffle"" and ""smarge""...which are in the book."
3,More Of The Same (3.5 Stars),"High & Mighty return with their 3rd full length LP. 12th Man is your typical High & Mighty release; average rhymes courtesy of Mr. Eon over dark, cinematic production from DJ Mighty Mi. The album suffers mostly due to a lack of variety. The reliable DJ Mighty Mi provides the tight beats that we've come to expect, but some have a ""been there done that"" feel to them. Depending on your perspective, it can viewed as very consistent or very redundant. 12th Man is definitely worth checking out, but don't expect these two to stray too far from their usual formula. Guest appearances include Tame One, Sean Price, and Princess Superstar."
3,High & Mighty ARE BACK,"Let me start of by saying that this cd has not left my player since I got it. They seem to be returning to there roots and have a real chance of coming back up in the came, especially with new comers like Reef the lost Cauz, Cheif Kamachi Ju Ju mob ECT put aside all the Weathermen Cage beef and appreciate this album for what it is a true hip hop classic all there albums have ben good the last one Highligt zone was tight but not as classic as this so if you like there Air force one E.P. are there first cd Home field then pick this up you will not be disapointed, tight beats sick flows and good guest spots. 3+ star album."
4,9X40 Rifle Scope,"This was a very good buy for the money, takes a bit of patience an know how to site it in on your target. Took mine to the rifle range and spent a good hour tweaking it to get it just right."
3,"Useful for Infantry Soldiers, not many others!","This book is compact and useful for mission planning and execution (planning missions like raids, ambushes, or reconnaisance patrols, calling in medevac, adjusting artillery, etc.). It is used constantly by students at U.S. Army Ranger School - you carry it with you at all times. But books like the ""Combat Leader's Field Guide"" are more useful for military officers and NCO's in field operations, since they have information on a much wider range of problems and equipment."
3,"Great info, bad production","This is perhaps the single greatest book on small unit tactics available. It is well organized, to the point and written after hundreds of years of experience. It is not a good manual for ""individual combat skills."" There is information that would be interesting to anyone needing to know about small team leadership int the field. There are good sections on warning and operations orders, patrolling and immediate action drills. Some of the information is only useful for study, as they are not applicable to anyone not supported by the larger US Army (like fire and air support.) This review would be a ""high four"" but it becomes a ""low three"" because of the production quality. A lot of the illustrations and tables have been copied so many times and reduced so much that they approach being un-readable. If you can find another version (hopefully that you can see hands on) get it."
1,NOT AS GOOD AS THE REVIEWS CLAIM!,When I purchased this book I was under the impression that the information inside would be easy to read and understand.Unfortunatly this was not the case for me.Most of the survival techniques are vague and unhelpful.The illustrations that are suppose to show you how toimplement these techniques are sketchy at best.To put it bluntly I had to return the book andfind another one that was more informative.So unless you are a military collector I wouldn'tsuggest buying this book.
4,ranger handbook,"Informative, yet very very basic. It seems to me that anyone reading this book would be fully aware of the operational tecniques of the rangers. They are efficient, yet very step by step, and predictable. Also the illustrations are a bit difficult to follow.if youre in high probabilty of encountering the US Army Rangers in combat, i suggest u read this book."
1,Ultimate Writing & Creativity Center,"This software was a big disappointment, b/c most of the writing ideas are reports of a factual nature. I had thought that the software would take my child through the steps of writing, but it didn't. Furthermore, the motivational comments are not motivational to my student, but rather annoying. I spent the money for nothing. We are not using the software."
4,Writing in ESOL Classrooms,"Appropriate for younger children or children at lower level of cognitive development. Bought it for middle school language learners. In general, they enjoy it. Easy to navigate."
4,Very Good,"Color was a little pinker than I expected, but service was excellent. And product is also excellent."
4,silly and exciting,My family all loved this cd. My seventeen year old and eleven year old daughters watch it more than my toddler son. The energy is natural and fun. Elmo is a little charmer!!!!!
5,You can't go wrong with Elmo's World,"My 17 month old loves anything Elmo, but the Elmo's World videos are her favorite. She starts dancing & smiling the minute that the song starts. I don't mind watching them over & over again with her either!"
3,oil > solid,"I prefer the oil because the solid perfume doesn't seem to last as long or be as intoxicating. Although it looks neat, it is hard to travel with it, because if you lean it on its side, it will open up."
1,No Scent,There is little to no scent. The only thing positive about the product was the container. Doesn't smell like the oil at all.
4,A Somewhat Biased Reveiw,"I admit I only read this book because I adore rats (as pets of course!) That being said I still enjoyed the book for its other qualities. I found it intriguing very few of the characters had actual names, most were given nicknames like ""The Girl"" and ""The Book Keeper."" It kept things simple.The book itself is written in small diary entries, of course in the first person, which can always add a certain depth to a story. I found that it had a lot of psychological commentary (perhaps accidental?) about hysteria and the over exaggeration of stories into myth and legend.I think this was a funny read but not scary in the least. Maybe that's just my take on it. Other rodent enthusiasts are sure to adore this little story but I'm not so sure if anyone outside that audience would or not."
4,Stewart Does it Again,"This book was first published in 1993. I just read it for the first time in 2005. Better late than never! I thought the first book in the series, 'Return to Isis,' was good, but this one is much better. Whit and Kali have convinced the council to let them rebuild Isis. As they start to make this happen, the council appoints three new leaders to ensure their success. Tensions (sexual, power struggles, revenge) build throughout the book until the dam breaks, but I won't hint to the conclusion.If you like science fiction and lesbians, you'll like this book. If you don't care for science fiction, you'll still like it. The SF isn't overly done, it just provides a setting for the story. Highly recommended. I'm looking forward to reading the third book, 'Warriors of Isis,' this weekend."
1,Keeper of Dreams,"This book is one of the worst i have read. Very confusing, the way it switches back to Owen then to Robert. Then when you start a new chapter, the book would add a new character, then after a few pages, it would finnaly tell you who this person is. Also, this book has very bad language, and should not be read by younger children. Also during the flashback, when the younger version of robert is in the train with Maureen, why did the author incorprate the peeing in the wind? Disgusting! NOT A PAGE TURNER"
1,Piece of junk,The 1B-1X I received was installed at a customers house that was not local. I was very disappointed when I had to go back out because the valve would not stop running. The valve I received was defective and I had to purchase another (from a local supplier this time) in order to get my customer back up and (NOT)running. Don't buy this item.
1,Completamente errado,"Un libro lleno de herejias y conceptos antibiblicos. Muy astutamente escrito para cautivar y conectarse con el lector, pero muy sutil en la manera que introduce conceptos que definitivamente no vienen de Dios. Seguramente el autor esta escuchando su propia voz u otra voz que no es divina. Si yo quiero respuestas, las busco en la Biblia o voy directamete a la fuente, es decir Dios. Por favor no se dejen confundir por este libro."
1,Left turn into Cyberspace,"After enjoying the first two books in this series, I eagerly awaited Lodestar. Now that I've finished it, I still eagerly await anything that resembles the first two books.If you take the Jimmy Poole at the virtual OK Corral story arc out of this book, the remainder of plot progress takes up no more than a hundred pages. Jimmy on a virtual gambling boat, Jimmy fighting virtual attacks, Jimmy fighting not to be a jerk and read his wifes book. Geez! Nuke Jimmy and get back to the plot."
3,Have to agree on the cover........,"I had to laugh reading the other reviews above. I bought thebook at a [book store] and almost had to buy a cheap magazine to cover up that dustjacket. Thankfully no one else was in the checkout line as I paid for it. After getting home and starting the book itself, I was hoping for some more background on the Fartrip mission, but felt ok with the direction that Mr Flynn took. I also am wondering if this is to be a ""Super-series"" of books and have we been reading background for some epic stories to come ? I am looking forward to the fourth book, (just please not so silly a cover)."
3,lindford character never made sense,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the 'hero' of the tale made no sense: a guy who has fathered 3 out-of-wedlock children, finally realizes his responsibility for these children and takes them on despite disapproval from society at large, etc. should have at least shown some real concern and hesitation before doing it again. He might have been tempted beyond his hesitation, but I object to the fact that he didn't seem at all worried about bringing another out-of-wedlock child into the world. Of course there were plenty of men who didn't care at that time, it's just that the author is trying to portray this guy as having seen the light. The previous reviewer talked about wanting to ""brain James"" and I felt the same way."
4,wow,just one of the best from the 80s ill be good and you dont have to cry love the music what a duo just whish they had stayed a duo the would still be a hit moster today it could have been endless
4,Marvellous singing,"Although the album has its fair share of filler( the awfull crash bang electro funk of Drive my love and Who's foolin' who conjure up memories of the very worst of the 8o's)there are the hits which sound even better 15 years later but the lp's only real talking point is the divine Your smile; deep passionate and very very soulful. Some of the notes Angela Winbush hits are not in the book.At least two of these 4 stars is for Your smile, it's that good!"
4,Rene & Angela Street Called Desire,"Rene & Angela created one of the best slow grooves of the 80's dance era, and always a favorite in the clubs (I'll Be Good to You) - had this only on 12"" vinyl for years, so was very glad to see it make it to CD format."
3,Big Improvement,"I originally typed a review out for this, but mistakenly put it under the old US remastered version. I'll give a shortened one here. The sound quality is a HUGE improvement. It kills Deadly Sting. It's much louder, bigger, more clarity, and a huge improvement in bass. The only drawback is the same kind of clicking present on some Priest remasters that appears on track 2 during a couple verses. It repeats and is somewhat distracting, probably more total clicks on this song then all the clicks combined from the whole set of Priest remasters. There's also the standard static and tape hiss flaws that seem to be showing up on remasters done after 99."
3,Animal Magnetism,"This is a good album, but it's not great. It's not as good as the other metal albums that were released at the time. It's worth it for the price. Most of these songs are not played live by Scorpions."
3,3rd favorite. ***1/2.,"""Animal Magnetism"" (1980) #52.This album is not as fluid as ""Lovedrive"" and ""Blackout"", but I still enjoy some great songs from rocking' German band. We get the album rockers like, ""The Zoo"", ""Make It Real"", ""Falling In Love"" and the title track. Also the power ballad ""Lady Starlight"". Again another top notch album cover."
3,OVERRATED !,"All the fans below are overrating this album! It is good, but how to compare it with ""Tokyo Tapes"" or ""Fly to the Rainbow"", for example? How! Ther's no chance.Anyway, it's a great CD, with strong and pop songs, like ""Make it Real"" and ""Only a Man"" (of course the lyrics in this Cd are already turning to the ""make love, be happy, I love a girl, sun in the beach"" themes)"
2,Scorps for 13 yr-olds!,"With this one, and especially the next one, Blackout, the music & lyrics surely took a turn for the worst, definitely taking aim at the 12-14 yr old market, with any seriousness tossed aside--any album they did after Lovedrive, in fact, just doesn't hold a candle to their earlier stuff, especially when they went for the big bucks & the commercialism of ""Rock you like a herd-of-cans"" (more like a herd of sheep)--sorry, they lost me starting with this one going forward. (forward?)"
1,Worse Than You Imagine,The Scorpions exemplified all the excesses and imperfections of 70s metal. The misogynist cover says it all. Scream on boys.
5,Great piece of rock history,CD was exactly what I was hoping to purchase. Several all time classics by Scorpions.CD arrived really quickly and was brand new as advertised.
3,Cute but not practical,"The table is very attractive and appears to be well made but it is extremely small. The table is very small in diameter and very low to the ground. It was my own fault for not checking the specs but the pictures of this item are deceiving. For the price, I do not think this toy lives up to expectations. I will be returning it tomorrow."
5,"Border Patrol Exam, 3rd edition.",This is a great product if you are interested in joining the border patrol. It gives good advice and offers a couple of practice test. The only problem is that it offers the same sample questions as the ones in the Border Patrol study guide that you actual get from the Border Patrol agency so it is a little repititous. It gives you good background info and on the hiring process and offers plenty of tips on how to do well for the written exam. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a career with Border Patrol.
1,Disappointed,"To be honest, when you sign up for the border patrol exam they send you a study guide. The practice tests in both books are the same test and most of the information are in both books as well. The study guide comes through the mail free also. One ok thing about the book was that it gave a little more insight into what the job is about where the study guide didnt have any info about the job at all."
4,excellent book to have,"I ordered this book just a week before my exam. I ordered the book next day air and sure enough I received it the next day on time. For anybody interested in taking the exam for the boarder patrol I would highly recommend this book, its like people always told me how sure am I that I will pass the test without studying for it? truth was that I wasnt ready. After reading the book and taking some of the sample questions that the book offered I was a little more ""aware"" of what the test was about and I have to admit that it helped me pass the exam. Good luck to anybody taking the test like I said this book is easy to understand and it does help with the test itsel."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"Use the written material the Border Patrol gives you. If you compare the explanation of the ALT in the book versus the material you get from the Border Patrol, it has some GROSS errors in it and will seriously impede your ability to study effectively for the exam. Don't waste your money. I threw the book away & only used the supplied material from the BP & passed with a 97%."
3,good start,"this book will give a good review so you don't go into the test cold no it doesn't go deeply into the vocab but any sat prep manuel like I used will prepare you for the vocab section. BUT BE ADVISED THE TEST IS GOING TO CHANGE ON JUNE 1, 2000 SO UNLESS YOU TAKE THE TEST BEFORE THEN IT MAY NOT HELP"
1,Fleecing those attempting to get hired as an Agent for Border Patrol,"I bought this review guide 2 weeks prior to the Border Patrol Exam for the sole purpose of ""fine tuning"" my speed and accuracy with the Practice Exams, and, unfortunately, I was very disappointed to find that it had too many errors. Explanations for the correct and wrong answers were vague. Many times they didnt make sense. Also, the spanish review was terribly written. Wrong use of verbs, sentence structure, etc. Its unbelievable that this ""updated"" edition is being sold as is. Save your money. Heck, for all I know I shouldve just reviewd LSAT Logical Reasoning questions. But I'm still glad that I passed with a high score without the help of this study guide. Good luck on your test! :)"
1,Poor editing,"If you are a horrible test taker and know nothing about the Border Patrol you may find this book somewhat useful. However, if your test taking skills are adequate and you have already read up on the Border Patrol this book is a waste of money. I bought this book to use the practice exams to gauge my speed and technique. The book let me down terribly as there was no apparent editing of the tests in the back and they are full of errors. Once again if you are looking to get this book to practice with the tests it is a waste of money."
1,a joke,this is the worse thing. the video itself was probably decent but on this venue it was terrible i was not happy with this at all
1,Heavyhanded political message,"The story of this movie has been mentioned in other reviews, as well as the political intentions of the director. So I will focus on her merits as a filmmaker - well, if there is anything at all to be mentioned.The movie is very slow and sometimes does not seem to move at all. Every word and every scene is heavy with the burden of the political message the director wants to deliver, and there she succeeds. The price is a static, sometimes extremely boring piece of film. Despite the very good actors (the one star is for them), I fell asleep in the middle of the movie. Its simply the direction and the editing I guess which makes it so slooooooooooow...."
5,Great,This is seriously one of the best anime series out. I was drawn in immediately. The ruthlessness of the characters on each side will astound you. You will be torn between which family that you are supposed to root for. The genius of this is that the series does a good job of Not favoring either side throughout each episode. Just when you feel comfortable to pick a side you are immediately thrown a curve ball. I watched the whole series in one day it draws you in that much. A MUST OWN PEOPLE I AM NOT KIDDING.
5,One of few animes I really enjoy,The whole Basilisk series is worth the money. I haven't found decent anime in a good while--but this is most excellent.
5,TOBY KEITH IS AWESOME!!!,"Toby Keith can not only sing great, but can write songs like no other! I think his song writing stands out from other songwriters music and has its own sound that is great! He should get a whole lot of more credit then he does! I think it so odd that he isn't ever nominated as top male artist. He blows allot of other country male artists away! This album is just another example of how great he is. The first time I heard ""We Were In Love"", I just melted! He did great on that one! And ""Tired"" is different and easy for allot of people can relate to. ""Dream Walkin"" was different as well that had catchy lyrics on it. I am without a doubt a hugh Toby Keith fan and very proud of this and all of his albums!!!"
5,Info 4 Ross,"I have some useful info about Toby that Ross may find useful before he makes himself look like an idiot again. Toby Kieth is a registered Democrat, and opposed the iraq war. But he loves this country and our soldiers. So think the next time you label someone with a sweeping generalization."
4,Great album for new country listeners,"This is the type of album that people who haven't been exposed to country music can enjoy. It's a nice mix of old fashion rock and roll and country western music. Songs like, ""Dream Walkin,"" ""I'm So Happy...,"" and ""Double Wide Paradise"" are all solid tracks that lead the album. A few nice suprises in ""I Don't Understand My Girlfriend"" and ""Yet,"" which might be the best song on the disc. This is a must for all country fans, and a nice album to begin a country music collection!"
4,His best CD yet.,"I am a big Toby Keith fan and to me this is his best CD that I have listened to. ""We Were In Love"" is what every country song should be. In my opinion there were more sleepers than hits, but every CD needs three or four of them. In my opinion he is one of the best in country music and rising fast. I can't wait for his next one!!!"
2,TOBY KEITH RIPPED OFF BIG HEAD TODD!!!,"Listen to the title track on this album, and then listen to ""Bittersweet"", by Big Head Todd and the Monsters. It's the exact same guitar melody! But hey, by Toby Keith's standards, it's really not a bad song. Probably because he ripped off someone who actually has talent. Also, this was back before he turned into a crazy flag-waving pseudo-political pro-Bush wacko, so he didn't annoy the hell out of me quite as much back then.But um, listen to the album ""Sister Sweetly"", by Big Head Todd and the Monsters. Toby thought enough of it to rip off a song from it, so you should listen to it too.Edit for Kevin Sloan: if you really can't hear the similarities between those songs, then you are the one who is on crack. I don't know what else to tell you."
1,"Bad grammer, bad formatting, bad book","I hate to be so mean, but this is the worst technical book I've read in my 17 year career in programming. I'm a 3D programming veteran, yet I couldnt understand anything this author was trying to say. The book is laiden with typos and very questionable grammer (clearly there was no editor for this book). The sample code's formatting is all over the page and thus impossible to read. And the content itself is just plain awful. The worst explanation of any API in computer history. Yuk!"
2,O.K. But No Tutorial,"The Book Claims To Have A Tutorial. It Doesn't. I Know Enough DirectDraw And Direct3D Already To Make It Out But If Your A Beginer Don't Buy This Book! The Tutorial Does Not Exist, The Author Or Editor Did Lie."
3,Reasonable- but incomplete on DrawPrimitive functions,"Generally this is a complete, up-to-date book on DirectX v5.0. However probably THE key new feature with this new release of DirectX is the DrawPrimitive functions - a concession by Microsoft to the greater beauty and elegance of OpenGL - this book describes these enlightening eatures in 3 and-a-half pages! Reciprocally the author spends many orders of magnitude more pages descriping execute buffers - this is a bit like writing a book on history spending most of it describing the dark-ages and adding a foot note on the renaissance. In summary - from the 3D end of things this is a good book if you want to descend into the dank, byzantine caverns (and soon to be obsolete(I hope)) underworld of execute buffers."
2,Poorly prepared and misleading,"The book shows every sign of having been rushed to press without checking. It is chock full of mistakes and anachronisms that will mislead anyone not already immensely experienced in Win32 programming. Its pedantic language (""What did we learn?"" and ""Our new and modified data structures"") can only appeal to elementary age schoolchildren. DirectX 5.0 was released well before this book was originally published, but I, for one, will not be purchasing the recently announced ""update"" to this book that adds 100 pages to cover DX5. The book is already about 300 pages too long."
2,Code is quite confusing but some topics are a bit helpful.,"Its a book thats aimed for a person who has a lot of time to waste in the understanding of code not making any sense, especially the code pertaining to terrain generation, which is very confusing and without any explanation. Secondly this book focuses basically on the retained mode and just copies the documentation of DirectX5 SDK help for immediate mode. One good thing about it is code and explanation handling of joystick and sound. Apart from it I don't find it any more useful. One can learn better reading the SDK help and code for other things."
2,"""Dont bother to read this rubbish""","The book is 820 pages. Wow! but 466 pages is reference (SDK)... It's very hard to compile some of his exemple. The book contain almost nothing about Immediate Mode, and he mix everyting with DirectInput and DirectSound. Do not buy it if you have the SDK!"
3,ok... not why I bought it..,I bought the book thinking that it would help me get started with Direct3D. I'm afraid that this is not a reason why you should buy this book. So why 3 stars? It holds a awesome reference to Direct3D RM. And should be bought with another book (like Cutting Edge Direct3D...) and be used as reference only.
3,Difficult to follow,"I consider myself a pretty smart guy, but I had trouble following the bits of code interspersed with the text. Not to mention that the code samples weren't aligned quite right with the chapter content.The code is obviously written by someone who's been doing game/graphics programming for a while. In other words, sacrificing good coding practices in the name of efficiency. The predictable result is that you get code that's hard to read, with very little efficiency to redeem it.And what's this fixation with C programming? Ever heard of C++? Given that DirectX is COM-centric, I'd much rather see a book that uses C++, with a section telling C programmers what changes they need to make in their own code."
2,"Good Retained Mode / Bad Immediate mode, Bad coding","I was disapointed that there was so little discussion of D3D's immediate mode. Especially since immediate mode is by far the most commonly used mode in current products. I was also disapointed in the examples which didn't compile correctly. The code had few comments, although some of it was discussed in the text. The retained mode sections were fairly easy to follow, and could allow a beginner to get something on the screen without much effort. A serious drawback to all books of this type is that you spend a lot for a book that describes an outdated format. I bought the Direct3D version 3 book a few months ago and now DirectX/Direct3D is up to version 6. There should be some sort of rebate for current owners who buy the latest edition of the book."
4,Thorough but NOT for beginners,"After reading several other reviews which comment that this book is not for beginners, I think it's only fair to point out that the book is labeled as being for advanced users. The book covers a lot of ground and it certainly helps to have at least a fundamental knowledge of Win32 programming. It also helps to have a firm grasp on the concept of objects and COM. My biggest complaint would be in that in order to follow along with the examples, you have to constantly resort to loading the source files from the CD as they are not reproduced in the book except for short snippets. This can become confusing because it is not always clear where the examples he's talking about are located in the code. I did appreciate the fact that this wasn't a book of wrapper functions and that it also has a reference section for Direct3D retained-mode. Overall, a good book if your willing to work a little to get the most out of it."
1,Why wont it compile!,"I bought it, and when I compiled the first program I was excited, but then I found some serious typo's that kept me from following his chapters. He refers to some files which just don't even exist on the CD, ""makefile"" was one such file, and this file was to be used to create all subsequent files in the book. I finally thought I had figured out how to compile his code and then I got linker errors. Maybe there is a library I needed to include or something, but he didn't explain anything about setting up Visual C++. So all in all I never got past chapter 3. Sad but true, I think the author had done a good job, maybe I needed something a bit more fundamental."
5,Something I was really looking for.,"I'm actually programming a Role-Playing Game and thanks to this great book, I found the answers to many of the questions, that nobody was able to answer before. That book covers almost everything you'll need in order to make a commercial-like game and although i found some difficulties following some parts, I still think it deserves a total 5-star rating. PS. Ignore the Texan-Boy reviews. I think, he didn't even read that book."
2,"This book is out of date, save your money","Unless you like working with resource hungry technology of yesterday then give this book a miss. Anyone who knows even a touch of direct X knows that retained mode has been abandoned for a couple of years, not a surprising as it was very rarely used and certainly not used in game development. I find it hard to believe that this book is still being sold, let alone at this price. Save your cash."
2,Awesome Power = MS Examples + explanation + mistakes,"This book was very good for explaining what was needed to write a D3D Retained mode app. What Kovach explains, he does very well, but there are some things he just ignores. Unfortunately, some of what he ignores is his own code. You'll outgrow this book quickly and turn to MS's examples, but you'll get up to speed with D3D RM quicker than with just the SDK examples. Its a shame that there were several mistakes, mis-matched and extraneous code, and ""black holes"" (his collision detection code needs major work, and I couldn't port it out of his examples.)"
2,A copy of Microsoft's documentation put and sold in a book,"First off let me just say that the book is 819 pages long, but the tutorial, explanations, or essence of the book ends on page 349!! The rest of the 400+ pages is simply a directx reference (every directx function with a two line description and the parameters they used in the functions). Who cares about the reference, this is something easily found on Microsofts webpage, in fact, word for word! The first two chapters are essentially the same as the microsoft example (again code is very similar). It throws alot of info at you, very fast, I've reread three times and am finally grasping the code though concepts are well explained. Examples are good but have WAY too much extra code that makes you go and weed out the relevant info. Author does promptly respond to email questions! All in all, this is probably still the best book out for direct3d though the microsoft samples and examples would do just as good of a job and you save $40.00."
1,"Useless, Simple Useless","I really feel sad for the trees that had to be sacrificed to print this book. The information here is more of a hindrance than help as NOTHING much is explained (unlike other 3D graphics books). Surprisingly, the documentation & samples provided by MS in the DX SDK is much more helpful. (and free as well)"
2,"The book is ""image"" of Eric Gray","I read many Eric publications especially on i-draft and RFC.This book is okay f you want to read the theory & ""higher"" level of MPLS and you have experiences with MPLS before. Although still it's not too detail on few chapters.Many chapters & paragraphs are a brief summary or copied prgh. from RFCs and I-drafts."
3,Second Joanna Stark book,"This is the second book of Marcia Muller's Joanna Stark trilogy, continuing the saga of her art security expert's duel with her nemesis Parducci. The first was: ""The Cavalier in White"" and the third is ""Dark Star."" Actually, I think this is my least favorite of the 3. Still, it's interesting to see Muller write of protagonists other than Sharon McCone--demonstrates her breadth of talent. Also, the Stark trilogy is heavily into the world of art and art theft as well as a series of books (like Sherlock Holmes vs. Professor Moriarty) with a continuing struggle between two characters (Stark and Parducci). Muller slowly and teasingly provides detail after detail to fill in the prior relationship between the two characters--considerably enlivening the tales. It's worth reading the entire trilogy. Enjoy!"
1,Just say NO!,Words can not describe how sad this movie is. It gives computer animation a bad name. Shown on USA Network last week it was hard to make it all the way through. I only did because I had been told how bad it was and had to see it for myself. Don't waste your money.
2,how to taste wine,"I thought the style of this book was too ""chatty"" & overall was not as enjoyable as other books I've read on the topic. On the plus side, I think her comments in general were accurate & the tables she provided were very informative. I guess I just didn't like her writing style."
4,a great book to build your knowledge of wine,"If you love wine and entertaining as I do, this is a great book. The beginning has a great section on understanding wines and the recipes I've found to be great and love how she matches them up with wine for great entertaining! If you love wine and entertaining and building your knowledge, this is a great book!"
1,This is hilarity?,"Listen to all the sample tracks before buying this depressing collection of music. Shallow in thought, but knee-jerk in reaction, this collection of tracks serves best as shock education for those who are unaware of the heart of the American Left. Why make an intelligent case for your point of view when you can merely rant? It must be less stress on their brains. As displayed here, Liberalism is truly a mental disorder."
2,poor craftmanship,"After receiving the beret, I formed it to fit my head. The stitching around the clutch was already coming out and one of the two eyelets on the side of beret had come off. Poor craftmanship on this beret, thus the low price."
3,Lost Universe is a decent series,"Lost universe is a decent series, but you may find yourself a little bored during the first few episodes. Near the ending of this series is where the real excitement is. The same animators from The Slayers did the animation for this series. The resemblence of the main character of Lost Universe to Lina Inverse is amazing. The story of this series is very similar to Star Wars. This is definitely a series not to miss, you just have to get through the beginning episodes."
5,20 stars,"I grew up with this magical book..I still have it, and my grand nieces and nephews have also read it. Check your local bookstores or spring for one online... one can't put a price on this beautiful gem !"
5,An Old-time Favorite,"Count me in on the people who read this wonderful book back in the 1950's. I can't believe it's been over 50 years since I read it. I, too, checked it out of the library quite a few times. I loved it dearly. I notice that 1 copy is available, and I'm still deciding whether to purchase it again, for old times sake."
3,The Brussels Griffon : An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy P,"It's a nice book, well printed with good pictures. Has good basic info about the Griffons. I get dissapionted with the training section. This section is for general dogs, not special for the Griffons. I think if you want general info (you don't know anyhing)about this dog you can by the book, but if you look just how you train your Griffon or want very deep info, don't buy it."
1,Not a good book.,"This book will do very little to help you understand the Brussels Griffon. There are only a few pages about Griffs. The rest is about any kind of dog, and Griffs are not like other dogs. They have many unusual traits. Save your money and buy a book that is really about Griffs. The only one I know of is Doone Raynham's."
4,Good general guide,"If you are thinking about getting a Griffon, this book is a good starting point, but shouldn't be your only resource. Most of the book is general information for any breed. The first 72 pages are devoted to the breed and the rest of the book to general basics of training and integrating a dog into your life. The book does cover temperament and suitability of the breed better than some other generalist books. The Griffon is like having a permanent two year old--highly intelligent, manipulative, and well--cute! As an experienced dog owner with another breed, I would suggest using this book to find out whether or not you are tempermentally suited to this breed whether it is a puppy, an adult, or a rescue and then visiting dog shows and talking with breeders and owners to finalize your decision to add one to your life! Even if you don't end up feeling you are suited to be a Griffon's companion, you'll find the cute pictures of the Griffon worth the purchase price!"
2,bland curry,"I love butter chicken and have used Indian ""pastes"" sold by Amazon and made by other companies. This brand isn't worth the money or the time."
5,Buy albums!,".You should buy ""The First Album""(1985), ""In The Garden Of Venus""(1987) and ""Universe""(2003) to get pleasure !!!because those are their best albums.""Selected Singles""(2001) is just a compilation for fans, not for a wide public!So don't abuse this CD-BOX, please!."
1,if you have one song then you have all of their songs!,"because one title has many different versions but the track it self is the same,...ha..ha..ha.."
3,Three Stars Because I Laughed Only Three Times (Exaggerated),"Is it me, or are there a lot of people summarizing the entire DVD in a 500-word-or-more-essay? Well stop it, sillies - you'll ruin it for everyone :PI really did not enjoy this Veggie Tale as much as the others - mostly due to my general dislike of the Rocky movies. S. Stallone is a nincompoop and Larry is a genius in comparison!My daughter loves the Heroes of the Bible tales, so I bought this to add to her collection. Hopefully she will like it when she's a bit older.The short story of St. Patrick gave me a good chuckle. The Veggie Stooges were... eh... less than desirable. The Larry Stooge (not played by Larry) creeped me out. Looked like Zeus lightening bolts sticking out of his head.That's all I got to say about that."
2,A big let down,Our family has always been excited when a new VeggieTales video is released. This one was a disappointment. Wish we would have rented before we purchased. This one wouldn't have been added to our video library.
1,The St. Patrick part was disparaging and intolerant,"They defined paganism as people that worshipped ""sticks and pond scum."" I found this hateful and inappropriate. It was clearly derogatory and meant to portray non-Christians as sub-human and insane. They could have used a historically accurate depiction of, say, druids (since it was in Celtic areas) and paganism rather than belittle and make fun of beliefs that differ from their own.I have purchased every Veggie Tales episode released, and have never been offended...until this. Smacks of intolerance and ignorance.Other than that, not one of the better releases at all."
3,Condescending - Very Disappointing,"My kids and I own, and thoroughly enjoy, almost every Veggietales DVD. This is the only one I dont like because of the story of St. Patrick. I try to teach my kids ACCEPTANCE of other people's religions, so I really don't like the way the Druids are portrayed. They are shown to be worshipping twigs and pondscum and are not intelligent enough to understand the ""god is three people"" metaphor, which, in my mind *is* rather confusing, but oh well.We're Jewish, but I have never had a problem with any of the DVDs, other than this one. They always show content that I can be proud of my kids learning - just not this time. Mocking the practitioners of a type of religion that literally millions of our ancestors practiced, (paganism in general - from the Vikings to the Druids to the ancient Greeks) does not strike me as learning good character."
3,Not my favorite JS shoes...,I love love love Jessica Simpson shoes so didn't even second guess purchasing these.They fit great but just feel a little bit cheap compared to her other shoes.I wish I liked them better.
3,Nice but cheap,"I bought these for my wife a while back. she liked them and said they were comfortable. I think they look really nice on. They feel rather cheaply made, however, and I would not bet on their longevity with frequent use."
1,I am sorry I can't recommend this perfume,"I like a lot of Auric Blends Temple Essence Perfume. For their low price, some of them are actually quality scents. I love Dark Opium and their single note scents as well. But I canNOT recommend this horrible jasmine. It was synthetic through & through in its single note. I gave it time, in its container and on my skin, but nevertheless, I threw it out. The container is adorable of course, but my complaint about all of their solids is that the lids don't screw on.Maybe I was just sent an old container, I don't know. But don't clutter up your perfume collection with this UNLESS you smell it in person & it doesn't have the synthetic stench."
2,"Unsturdy, broken","Some good things: it's cheap (I bought mine at Wally World actually, and it's even cheaper on here), it goes up easily, fits large openings, and isn't difficult to operate. But that's where it ends. It doesn't fit extremely snugly - I thought I had it fitting really well and then my son managed to knock it down and fall off the porch -_-So, I tightened it up. By one notch. And the ruler-looking piece that adjusts the tightness? Damn thing snapped in half.A different reviewer said it works better in smaller spaces. May be true, but if it's sold as being able to fit larger openings successfully, it should do that."
1,Looking for another baby gate,"This is okay if you need something for just a couple of months and if you also LEAVE IT UP. However, if you plan on taking it down, it can become quite cumbersome as it will come apart and you have to 'reassemble' it every time. We've used it for about 3 months now and the plastic pressure mount has broke on one side. Also, I had to mark the area on the gate with magic marker where to press it down as it moves everytime you go to put the gate back up. With little kids in the house, I'm looking for a gate that I can keep up with a swinging door."
1,Piece of junk.,This is a piece of junk it has come apart and the wood is cracking and I just got it 2 days ago I am so disappointed that Amazon would sell something so shoddy.
2,"Not recommened for ""Climbers""","We intially bought this gate to contain our 7 week old puppy in the bathroom while we were at work. It only took her 4 days to realize she could scale the to the top of it, jump from the top and procede to find my yarn stash and have it strung every where in my living room (oh puppies...) If she wasn't a climber it would have been perfect, instead we had to come up with another solution during the day.As for installation, it's pretty easy. If you can find the perfect adjustment on the gate to match your doorway be sure to mark it with a pen or a marker. It is pretty sturdy once you find that right number."
2,"Flimsy, won't hold up.",Waste.. dogs knock it right over. Even my dog that's 2.5 pounds found out how to get out. Fun times!
2,doesn't work if you have baseboards,"We have fairly prominent baseboards along our walls and the bumpers cannot even reach the wall. For now I just lean it where i want, but I will have to taper the bottom edges when I have time so that I can actually use it as it was intended."
2,Doesn't fit snuggly,"I bought this gate and it does not fit properly. There is no ability to adjust it to fit snuggly. It's either too loose and easily tips over when touched or so tight that is sounds like it is breaking or damaging the wall, yet it still will not fit."
1,The North Stataes Pressure Mount Diamond Mesh Wood Gate is garbage!!!,"I purchased this gate to block my dog out of the area where the cats are and it is total garbage. The ""locking system"" does not lock, it has to fit into one of their spacing, the pressure pieces on the side do not stick out far enough to actually brace against the wall. I tried for about an hour to install this and finally threw it in the trash. I have never written a review before but I have also never been this disappointed with a purchase."
1,you get what you pay for very cheap,This gate was smaller than I had pictured. I needed to pay more attention to the height. It was hard to set and has already fallen apart after 3 weeks. You get what you pay for a good price for a flimsy gate.
2,You get what you pay for,This is a situation where you get what you pay for. It is very cheaply constructed and is not square so we had to use shims to get it to fit in the door frame squarely. I don't have a lot of confidence in it as my 9 month old uses it to pull herself up. So far it hasn't given out with the shims in there.
1,Poorly Made,I bought two of these gates to keep my new puppy contained in different rooms. It didn't work properly. The 'secure' holding was so weak that my 2.5 pound pup was able to knock it down. Waste of money. Returned it for a refund.
2,Low quality,"The good is that it is made in the USA. The bad is it isn't the same as the one I bought 15 years ago from them and still works.The rubber bumpers on the ends that should help keep it up can't. The metal rails that slide the two gates back and forth come off track and bend easily.Plus this is one of those items that if you don't return it quickly as in 5 days, you can't."
1,Extremely flimsy!,"I will start this review off by saying that I have never left an item less than 4 stars before and I've written almost 30 reviews on Amazon. I bought two of these and one of them fell apart the first time we set it up. I was able to fix it, but it took 15 minutes and it is loose now. Also the mesh is really thin and poorly attached. My 15 lb. dog was able to push himself through it and pull it off the frame the first day. If he can I'm sure a toddler could too. Also now there are staples exposed on the broken one. I have an old Safety First gate I've had for 12 years and we use all the time which is still in great shape. I will stick with those in the future. I would not buy this gate again or recommend it to anyone."
5,Great gate for cats!,"I use two of these gates, yes two, within a doorway to prevent one of my cats from leaping to the outside. It's a remedy so that I can keep the door open for fresh air, but mindful that my cat won't try to escape to an enclosed courtyard where other tenants might have their patio doors open, etc. I highly recommend this gate. It's easy to use and sturdy."
4,Thumbs Up,"An excellent product for the money. Easy to operate. My little dachshund found a way to scale it, tho! Very well-made and very cost-effective."
3,My Cat Knocks Them Over,"These gates are okay, I like that they are easy to put up, but my cat who is about 25 pounds can easily knock them over. I originally got them to stack up in a door frame in my apartment, because the kitchen has no door and I want to keep the cat separated from my five year old step son, but the cat knocked them down within 15 minutes. So unless you're using them to keep a very small child from climbing stairs, or entering a room, I wouldn't recommend these gates."
5,Easy to use,I actually bought this gate to keep our pet from coming up stairs to our bedroom during the nights. It works wonderful and everyone in the family is able to use it.
3,Fine for the price,This is just fine for the price. I would hesitate to use it in a high traffic area as it is a bit wobbly and takes a bit to mount straight on a wall. Easy to use out of the box. We own the large (taller) version of this and it less wobbly.
4,Good quality,So far- this has worked out very well. It's huge! It definitely covers the entire backseat of the car and seems to be of good quality. We haven't washed it yet ao I can't speak to that issue but in general we like it better than previous cheaper covers we have purchased.
2,Doesn't stay closed,"Bought the gate hoping it would fit. It gets 2 starts because it fits the space, but the bar doesn't stay down, so it keeps popping open and falling over. I've had to duck-tape it closed and it's still not doing great with that..."
4,Keeps the dogs out!,I bought two of these gates when I rescued a dog. He was not potty trained and I needed to keep him blocked into a manageable area. They arrived quickly and did the trick! They contained him and I was happy with how securely they closed into the doorways!
4,Classic Pressure Gate,"This is a classic gate that stays up with pressure. Easy to use, but I would be hesitant to use it for kids. I've gotten a couple of splinters just trying to put it up, and the mesh can be a bit sharp as well."
2,NO STOPPERS!,"If you're trying to carry a child and keep your dog back with the other, this gate is NOT for you. As you're lifting the latch to move it if you let it open all the way up it will fall apart. It then take 10 minutes to line up the wooden frame with the metal brackets to get it back together. Don't waste your money! Spend the extra $5 and get the better one, promise. This one's NOT worth it."
5,basic and reliable,"we bought one for the base of the stairs, then a few weeks later got one for the kitchen, then one for the hall. It's easy to set up and remove, low enough to step over (my wife and I are both tall), and doesn't mar the walls or woodwork.One tip -- once you get it dialed in, take a heavy black marker and put lines on either side of the correct notch. This will remove the guesswork for when you have to put it back up in a hurry."
4,Function at a Great Price,"In our experience, the two gates fit perfectly and are easily adjustable. Just what we needed to keep a new puppy out of the carpeted area of the house. We're ordering a third for the stairs - she's learning to get around way too fast! For a basic, low-priced gate, it's tough to see how this one could be beat."
1,come on Phil!,I bought this Cd a couple of months ago and listened to the firstfive songs terrible!Phil should make up with Dimebag & Vinnieand get Pantera back together!Best Metal band I've ever heardway better then Metallica!The best thing Phil should do isbecome the new Lead singer for Drowning Pool!that would be amazing.And dont waste your time with crap like Superjoint Ritual!
5,intense aggressive grooves,"FACT: its hard to find good aggressive grooves that immediately accelerates the pulse, facilitates the aura of invincibility, and keeps the intensity throughout all....as PANTERA: VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER did back in the day...well look no further....I can best describe this as: moaning/wailing 'sabbath with steroid rage' guitar rhythms, double bass attack with killer breaks creating an unyielding in your face transitional circus....brought to u by the headman from the band mentioned above.....phil(who is the headman and throat here), it's a requirement to own."
1,Superjoint Rip-off,"This will be straight to the point, this cd SUCKS! This sounds like some lame ass punk band TRYING to be metal. Phil needs to pull his head out of his ass and get back to what hes best at and as what the his fans know him for and love him as and thats as frontman of Pantera; where he belongs."
1,Why did Phil leave Pantera?,"Phil Anselmo needs to drop the drugs, man. In Pantera, he was good, and now this crap? His vocals are too low; listen to Cowboys from hell to hear his good vocals. And Hank williams jr as a metal musician? Do yourself a favor, fellow CD buyer. Buy Reinventing the steel or Cowboys from hell or Far beyond driven. Don't buy anything by Superjoint ritual."
3,"uh, sure.","Man, I wish I could take those three stars away. I wrote a review ealier on this album, but upon listening to it again I realized that is's utter garbage. Phil Anselmo claims that this band is the living end of both hardcore and metal, but I dunno... this doesn't sound like hardcore or metal to me.It sounds like a drunk guy trying to shout stupid lyrics over badly played punk music. If you want real hardcore and metal, try Comeback Kid and Shadows Fall, respectively."
1,Wish they were.....,Very disappointed in this uninspired rehash. Talented musicians who can do more. Honestly one gets more compositional wonders out of a Ramones album. Phil go back to Pantera because thats where you rocked!
2,A toothless beast.,"I get that this is meant to be a downright raw, heavy blast. It's meant to be spirited angst. Yeah I get that, but in the current music scene there's thousands of bands trying to out-nasty each other, to out-f**kyouup each other, and Superjoint Ritual surprisingly seem a little tame. Tame, but at the same time quite unlistenable. This is not due to an immense vile speed and heaviness, but more to do with a lack of interesting writing and an overall grating, muddy sound. Phil's voice begins to irritate me after a short while, and the instrumental work is oddly one-dimensional, varying predictably between speedy thrashes and slow not-quite-heavy-enough dirges. So, it ends up neither taking my head off, nor engaging my head. Disappointing."
3,fair,I bought this alubm not knowing what to expect. And it suprised me to say the least. it has very hard tracks i would say the first 6 are have very good lyrics and riffs but i begin to lose interest after that and take it out of my c.d player. So for the first half of the record its good but it just starts sounding the same after that. so either you love or you dont!
2,My Thoughts,"This cd was ok , it kind of grows on you after listening to it for a few songs , granted I still think it sucks more than anything . Long story short , I personally would not recommend to anyone , but thats my opinion ."
5,A Lethal Dose Of Ritualistic Awesomeness,"Phil Anselmo has done it again! Thank God (or Satan) that he didn't use Superjoint only once and destroyed them! This is one of the most brutal, hardcore, extreme, (insert cliche here) ""mainstream"" release ever!! This is Black Flag on roid rage (a fave band of Phil's). Most Pantera fans won't buy this or get into it because it will scare them. The ones that DO get it know how GREAT this noise is!! Hard to believe this comes from the bayou country and has Mr. Hank's grandbaby on bass! Thanks Phil!"
2,Unprogressive/unimpressive,"Astonishlinly unoriginal... While there is some potential here, this album manages to sound both like a ""demo tape"" and EXACTLY like their last album ""Use Once And Destroy"". I mean, how many times can use say ""1,2,1,2,3,4!!!"" before each song??? I love that Phil Anselmo fully embraces old-school metal, but heavy metal is also about taking music to the next level and pushing the envelope... There is no envelope here, just a bunch of old letters stuck in a drawer."
2,Disappointing Followup,"I was a fan of Use Once And Destroy. It took a different approach at ""hardcore"" and took extreme metal to a different level. It was an exciting album. Lethal Dose of American Hatred seems sorta forced to me. There isn't anything about the album that stands out as great. Honestly, it gets tedious after like 5 songs, which is unfortunate for a big Phil Anselmo fan like myself. I think it is time to focus on Down."
1,It Sucks,"This band suck, and worse of all I made the mistake of buying this album. Somehow I thought it would be somewhat good but I was wrong. It has no melody, there is just nothing good about this album. If you like hearing some idiots howling like morons all through the album then this album is for you, but I just would not waste my money on such garbage."
3,A better record this time around,"Phil's new band is pretty good sounding better this time around but for a true look see the dvd which is pretty cool for sure! They sound a lot like the top Philadelphia metal thrash band, Pier 6 Brawl."
2,oh my god!!,this cd sucks!! it is horrible and they all sound like black flag songs. The lyrics are terrible and Phil sounds like he's only saying one line over and over. I gave this two stars because track 2 and 3 are pretty cool.
2,Better than silence,"This CD was kind of a let down. Phil rocks as always, but themusic is stripped down and ""simple"". Not one song really jumped out as a hit. I'm not impressed with the music at all. Pantera was WAY better. This band is trying to be like Slayer and failing at it. Badly."
3,A Lethal Dose Of American Hatred (?),"I have always loved Pantera. I don't think I am alone when I say that Phil is 'losing' what he had. In songs such as Cemetary Gates and I'm Broken, his voice is really deep and sharp. I was left a little dissapointed after listening to Superjoint Ritual's latest release 'A Lethal Dose of American Hatred', as these are truly some of Phil's worst vocals. And what's with the '1, 2, 3, 4!' at the beginning of 60% of the tracks on this album? The guitars are as heavy as ever, and the hard-hitting double bass is as headbanging as ever, but if you want something truly complete in its efforts, I reccomend A Vulgar Display Of Power, by non other than Pantera."
4,TRUE F*CKING HARDCORE,JUST GETTING BACK TO THE BASIC HARDCORE THAT I GREW UP WITH. IT MAY NOT BE PANTERA BUT I STILL THINK ITS KICK ASS!!!!!!!
4,THRASH AND METAL MAKE A GOOD LISTEN,"Well Phil Pantera Anselmo is back with in my opinion his bestband besides Pantera.Down,Necrophagia,and Viking Crown are allgood,but Superjoint Ritual are the best and this album kicks way more ass than there first outing.Waiting for the turning point,Dress like a target,The destruction of a person,Death Threat,Knife rises,and The pagans are the best on this cd.Now the muscianship on this album and in this band is not as strong and good as Pantera the drumming although fast doesn't touch VinniePaul and the guiatar playing doesn't touch Dimebagg Darrel but there is one good solo.But Phil works well with these guys because his screams and growl are gut renching and just flat outevil and totally bad ass.Well this band will probably be wherePhil is gonna remain hopefully they don't try to expand their sound or anything because thre about the only good tatooed,longhaired,redneck metal/thrash band left..."
1,"HORRIBLE, JUST HORRIBLE, but funny 1, 2, 3","This proves that people can make mistakes. Even Phil is human. He made a human error by getting this band together...or is retarded. In fact, who ever ""ok'd"" this album to go into production just wasted a lot of money. Damn, this CD just sucks. I'm not going into Pantera...but ..I don't know. Don't even bother downloading this album. You'd just be wasting time and hard drive space. If you listen to this, and if you can barely play any instrument..you'll think you can put out a cd."
2,Phil Is Losing Steam,"Well, obviously this band is going to draw comparisons to Pantera, which is the best thing Phil has ever done. This band and album are nowhere near what Pantera was, and nowhere near what Phil is capable of. First off...the lyrics are terrible.""Druggies are hippiesBut were not hippies were slippiesLike the Manson family..""And so on. You would never find a line like that in a Pantera song. Phils vocals are weak. His growling is nowhere near as intense as it is in say ""5 Minutes Alone"". His screaming is high and pathetic.The musicianship is nothing special. Its just there. No real interesting riffs. Once again--nowhere near the standards of Pantera.Now I wasnt expecting Phil to create another Vulgar Display Of Power. But I make all the Pantera references because I know what Phil is capable of, lyrically and vocally and this album is sub par."
1,"Dear GOD, what has the world come to...","when more people actually PREFER junk like this over a great band like Damageplan? Incoherent screams and sh*tty guitars does not music make, my friends."
1,Pantera is better...,No offence to Phill or any thing but i mean dont get me wrong his vocals are still awsome but superjoint ritual's sound just doesnt do any thing for me... I also do not like down because both Phill's side project are boring! I hope Phill just keep with pantera because thats real music and talent. Im sorry to say this but both down & superjointritual suck! Pantera f*cking rules tho! Laterss!!
5,indubitably quaint metal within established parameters,"After reading many reviews it's funny how everybody and there ... brother is THE biggest Pantera/Phil fan there is. Big deal. I'm not ""dissing"" anybody, it's just useless information. Now, on to SuperJoint...This release smokes, just as the first did. It is a bit different, but that is a good thing. After listening a few times, I tried reading the lyrics to the music. I think some of the lyrics are kinda stupid. But still-5 stars, so it's MOST DEFINITELY not a big deal....if lyrics are your thing then you will be dissapointed. It is a bit short also.."
5,"An actual, detailed and pleasant book","In a very balanced way, between the "" conaissance"" and the simple language, it is a very good book. Most of the conseils and description of the beers of the world are correct. The others i'll try!"
1,When good software goes bad,At one time maximizer had a huge following and was good for 1 user or 100 users. Since it switched from the Pervasive data base to Microsoft SQL Server it sucks green swamp water. Version 11 did not work out of the box. Maximizer offered to make it work on a stand alone computer for $50 per half hour. Further they crippled a lot of features available to work with SQL server. Besides a horrendous installation and a space consuming block of cement this program no longer has any value. You can't adjust column width or many other things that you could do in previous versions. Avoid this like a plague. You will need to hire an IT person to keep SQL server working and stay working even for a stand alone system. You will need to pay $50 per half hour for tech support - no exceptions - even if it does not work out of the box.
5,Excellent Resource,"As an English and Linguistics Major, I have found this book very useful. It has a easy-to-read format with clear charts and helpful examples. It provides an excellent foundation in language and language learning. This is the perfect book for people with little knowledge of linguistic issues! Similarly, it will provide a very thorough review for anyone with a background in language study. EVERY TEACHER SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK AS A RESOURCE!"
4,"Even I thought this was funny--and I'm one of the ""her's""!",My husband received this book as a gift a number of years ago. I read it before he did and thought it was great! I saw not only myself in this book but my husband as well. I highly recommend this book if you want a good laugh.
1,Worse book I've read in a long time...possibly worst ever.,"Drags...and drags...and drags. No action. Limited plot. Boring...Boring...Boring. All those who gave this ""See Spot run"" novel more than 1 star must not read much or live a very sheltered life. I have finished every book I have ever started but this one was a real chore. Don't waste your time or your money. Get an older Grihssom novel if you can't find anything else...like A Time to Kill. I warned you..."
5,The Best Murder Mystery I have ever Read,In my opinion this book can be judged by it's cover. You can tell from the moment you see it that it is going to put you in suspense from beginning to end. It is a book that must be bought. John Misak is a young inspiring author that should be made famous. I cant wait to read his next book Time Stand Still. I only expect the best along with everyone else who has read Soft Case.
5,Very entertaining,"I have read some of the reviews here and would like to say that I disagree with the criticism of this book. I found this book rather entertaining. And that's what a book is supposed to be. The characters and places were quite believable. I could imagine John Keegan's apartment, his lifestyle, and knew that I would never date a person like him. And that's what so good about a book like this, it seemed real!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Worked for me,"I found out about this book earlier this year from a friend of mine in Atlanta. I had gained a lot of weight over the holidays and I was really feeling uncomfortable. Although I wasn't perfect all of the time on the plans, I still have lost over 25 pounds. I really liked the recipes and the strategies. I was suprised at some of the foods that weren't included but after reading the reasons I had a better understanding. I also liked that the book did not stress being really thin. I still have a few more pounds that I want to lose then I'll be ready to maintain."
3,OK,"This definitely works...I've used it to lose about 20 lbs. But you have to be mentally ready to eat only items off of ""allowed"" list. I've tried several times after my initial success, but failed due to a strong desire to eat other foods...maybe I just have willpower issues...but if you stick to the plan you will lose and if you exercise in addition to the plan, you will lose more!"
5,Love it,"This camera is fun! I got it with the 1G Ultra SD card, and it is sooo much faster and easier than my old camera. It's easy to navigate, the screen is large so pix are easy to see, although it is a little grainy. I enjoy the features and different settings. Should be foolproof picture taking under varying circumstances. I like that it has a viewfinder, which is very hard to find nowadays, so when you are in the sun, you can frame the picture and not guess if you are pointing the camera right. And I wanted a better zoom, and this has it. I think the longer zooms are not as steady. This one has been great. The movie mode is even easy, so I can catch the kids quickly when I want to. I love this camera!"
3,Good for the price,"I brought this camera as a gift item and before I ordered this item, I did an extensive research and compared this camera with other brands which had same MP. And, I was so convinced that for a price of 175$ and a Canon camera that is, this would make a better camera than any of its competitors. Sadly, it turned out to be a lil disappoinment when I received it. The only problem am facing is that in Auto mode whenever I take a snap, it's always shaky. And that's one thing I hate most. Now, I take all snaps in 'Kids & Pets' mode which is intended for taking moving objects. Also, there's this problem of having to set the date and time everytime the camera's power is turned on. I thought these would subside with days of usage, but it's still occuring. And, I don't think a great product should have a very obvious defect like this. I expected more from Canon. But, with the price I guess this is bound to happen."
5,Great camera and a great buy,I love this camera. Canon is always our camera choice brand. Well worth the money. Its also very user friendly.
5,It's great!,"The product arrived on time, contained everything needed, and beat the price in the big box store."
2,Cheap construction is this cameras down fall!,Construction is a downfall here. Pictures are marginal. Better solutions for the money!
1,This Camera is TERRIBLE in low light conditions,"I can't believe all the people raving about this camera. All I can figure is that these are the kind of people whose idea of photography is to line the family up from tallest to smallest in the driveway on holidays and flash away.This camera appears to me to have been designed by an egghead who values pixels far above f-stops.The camera's programming is guaranteed to give blurry pictures anytime you shoot without a flash in anything less than full sunlight. Let me give you an example: I just stepped outside at 4pm on an overcast day. It's daylight outside, but no direct sunlight. I turned the flash off and pointed the camera at grass, light colored wood fencing, and a white dog. You know what the camera used? f 5.6 & 1/12. In daylight conditions, it chose 1/12 sec exposure!!!Canon, hire a photographer to advise your code monkeys.Reader, do not buy this camera if you have any intention of ever turning the flash off."
1,A 540 Review,"The camera works just fine, gr8 picture clarity, easy menu options, a big display which makes viewing pics moere better,its got 4x optical zoom which works out just fine, can record videos with decent audio and video clarity.Problem areas:- The display simply washes out in sunlight,if you are taking pictures in flash mode the time lag between taking pictures can be as long as 4 seconds..which can be irritating at times, it works fine without the flas mode on. You can take upto 10-12 mins of video with 1 gb card, i was expecting a 1 GB card to take a much longe video....But overall I would give the camera 8/10"
2,Marginal Performance,6 MP can only deliver a certain clarity of the pictures. The memory card which comes with the camera has a capacity of 7 to 10 photos max. In summary a camera for the beginner; does not satisfy higher demand.
3,It's Just Okay,I had a Samsung digital in which the instructions were incoherent. I speak with just a little authority of the english language while holding a degree in Avition maintenance.Cannon is far more superior.
1,I advise that no one buys it,"We have sent me camera does not work and sent the camera to him, and after two weeks of waiting to learn that he did not send irreplaceable"
3,Review of Canon PowerShot A540 6MP Digital Camera,HiI was not quite satisfied with my buy becuase the camera takea a long time before it can snap the next photo. I am not sure if this just with my camera or a generic problem.The pics are good.thanksAshish
4,Plastic,"I was very disappointed to discover the Canon A-series is now made of plastic! I was expecting the same solid feel of the older Canon sureshot.I called Canon and they said it is made of a ""durable plastic"" in order to make it lighter. I think that should be mentioned in the description.Oh, and the lens is also made of plastic, which I didn't know (glass is superior but of course would cost more). My only complaint is that once again, there is no mention of that in the description."
3,Good features; questionable quality,"I like the features of the camera. However, a few weeks after purchase the lens cover began to stick when opened. I discussed, via email, with Canon and it is now on its way to Canon's service center for examination and repair. I have had a few similar experiences with products purchased through Amazon and am beginning to wonder if your suppliers, particularly those who drop ship, supply Amazon customers with items from batches that may have marginal quality control records.In addition the documentation about the camera is not clear. If the camera comes back from Canon fairly quickly, and performs well when it arrives, I will consider it a good purchase and recommend it to others.Tom Mortimer"
4,"A good, basic camera",I needed a new camera and my husband found this one and ordered it for me. It's easy to use. I like that it can use rechargable or regular AA batteries. It's a bit slow between photos and sometimes my photos come out blurry which they never did with my old camera. But the blurry factor could certainly be user error. I'm not a technical/gadget whiz. But overall I really like the camera.
1,broken,"I received this camera with the lens frozen, no batteries, no memory chip. I do not know if it even works. The seller advertised the cameraq as in very good condition; Not! The shutter is frozen eliminating all the close-up and shots you want depth adjustment. I am through with Amazon forever."
4,Easy Use Canon Powershot,"For travel, this camera is light weight and easy to use. I love that I now have a camera that i can dowload to my canon printer and/or computer.Great Camera, not quite professional photos but very clear and very good for vacations and family events"
5,Canon Powershot A540 Digital Camera,A mighty midget in picture-taking. Easy to operate and giving superb results in terms of quality in colour and definition. An all-round pleasure.
2,Not worth it.,I bought this camera when my old Sannon was broken. I thought it was good but once I got it I regretted it immediately. Because the monitor is 2.5 and the camera is run by 2 AA batteries the batteries never lasted long at all. I had to change them 3 times from Christmas Eve morning to Christmas night. That is way too much. I sent it back and purchased a Cannon SD630 Elph. It was a little more money but well worth it.
4,A540 Review On Motorcycle,"I needed and easy camera to use while riding my motorcycle. Being an art director and motorcycle enthusiast this was an awesome camera user friendly for one hand operation while on bike, and all the advanced features an Art Director would prefer. Very pleased."
3,Battery Death,"I purchased this camera because I already had the A520 and found the A520 to be reliable and provided really decent photos. Plus, it had all the features I wanted. Then my son got that camera and I bought the A540. More megapixels and the same features as the A520. There is one major detraction: the battery life is poor. I've researched this and found that others have complained about this.I will contact Canon and see if they can fix it."
5,What a great little camera!,"I was looking for a camera with more features and capabilities than my Fuji FinePix Z1. Though my Z1 is small, easy to use, and takes great pictures, it does not do well in certain lighting conditions. After some dreadful shots at a wedding last week I went on the prowl for a better camera. From the second I started shooting with the Canon PowerShot a540 I was in love! One of my favorite features of this camera is the ability to quickly change between Auto, Programmed, and the various Image Zone special scene modes... and I can have separate size and quality settings for each one! (though the 10 or so special scene modes share a common size/quality setting.) The custom timer with options for delay and number of shots is another nice touch. I'm not throwing away my Z1, but it may get some dust on it..."
5,NOVICE LOVE'S THIS CAMERA!,"Based on all the wonderful reviews I read on the A540 I choose this as my first digital camera, and glad I did! Awesome camera for the money, and the most important factor to me was the big 2.5 LCD, I love it! Simple to read instruction manuel had me ready to start shooting in minutes! Believe me,if I can do this anyone can! The first week I took it with me to ""Bobby Q's"" birthday bash and it took fabulous pictures in a dimly lit restaurant. I passed the camera around for everyone to review photo's and they could't get over the quality of the pictures it took. I could use more zoom so I'm purchasing the Opteka 2.2 Telephoto lens, well worth the $30 extra dollars!"
4,"Nice camera, nice value.","This camera is a very nice item for snapshots as well as some more sophisticatied photography. Reasonable price. Good 4x optical zoom, which is better than most. Large and fairly bright screen for composing and reviewing photos. What I really like, with my aging eyes is, when you change modes, the way it briefly displays a large icon on the screen identifying the new setting. The icon then fades to its smaller size and peripheral location. Older Canons didn't do this."
3,Canon A540,"Great camera with lots of functionality and capabilities. Easy to use, compact, light weight, and functionality that rivals SLR cameras. I like the large screen size, but the screen resolution is fair to poor. It handles only 2 AA batteries (versus 4 on other cameras) The manual states you can get up to 90 images with AA Alkaline batteries and up to 360 images with NiMH batteries. My experience with this camera is poor battery life if you use flash and the movie feature. You will need recharable batteries for this camera because Alkaline batteries won't last. I took 20+ pictures and a couple 7 sec movies with new Alkaline batteries and the camera warned me that my batteries were low. A battery charger is extra and the camera doesn't come with a carrying case. This is a great, inexpensive camera, but the poor battery life and the low screen resolution are real detriments."
4,"good quality, slightly overpriced","good quality, everything it said it would be, etc. but i went to staples the day after it arrived, and newer model was 20 dollars less. so i think it was overpriced."
2,Disappointed!,"I researched before I bought this camera, but after using it a month, I'vebeen very disappointed. The resolution was not sufficient, and the outdoor color was washed out looking. A lemon? I don't know, but Amazon allowed me to return it, Thanks Amazon!All in all, I could not recommend this camera."
4,Great Camera,"This camera is really great - especially for the price. I upgraded from a Kodak easyshare and it has better low light capability, optical zoom, etc. also love the big lcd screen.My only complaint is that the menu functions are pretty complicated to use - I think more than they have to be."
2,Overwhemed by overchoice,"This device very user unfriendly. It comes with three (COUNT THEM-THREE) separate manuals plus a couple of brouchures. I am still on the-how-to-use-the camera manual. The camera has literally hundreds of features but the manual is incomprehensible.I had to call customer service to figure out how to make selctions but I still don't know why I would want to make them. The manual is completely silent on why/when/for what purpose I would want to use these features. I won't even discuss how could I remember all those features if I were out actually taking pictures of something--which I haven't ventured to do. I've just stayed home taking practice shots of my cat and erasing them. HuhAfter several weeks, I have not yet ventured into the how-to-print manual or that computer disc that comes with the third manual.I asked customer service if Canon sponsors classes in how to use these little suckers. No.I am not at all pleased with this purchase."
4,As Expected,"I owned an earlier model of this camera, which I was very happy with. It is pretty much the same except for higher resolution, bigger screen and it now uses SD cards instead of compact flash. I like the SD better since it is smaller and my laptop has a built in reader for it. My only regret is not waiting a little longer since the price keeps dropping."
2,Took too much time,I bought this camera for action stage shots. I was not impressed with this camera. The time it took between shots to process was way too long. Especially in a busy photo shoot. Returned it my Sony was much faster.
1,Camera LENS mechanism BROKE after 13 months!!!,"We really liked this camera until yesterday and we got the famous Canon Lens Error. (do a search on the web for Canon e18 error). My wife took a picture of the kids for Christmas and switched the camera to play mode to review the shot and it blacked out the LCD with a message that said LENS ERROR, RESTART CAMERA. She did so, and it started making a grinding noise. The camera is now junk and not worth fixing. THANKS CANON!"
5,Lota Bang for your buck!,"This camera exceeded my expectations 10 fold. It may be lightweight, (perfect for traveling) but it is heavily armored. Its capability to act as a macro lens (2 inches from a subject) and 6 mega pixel, night vision, and cool feature ""stitch mode"" to create panoramic...and all for under $240---folks, it doesn't get better than this at that price. I specked this for an office camera. After using it, I bought one for myself!"
2,Poor Quality,"The pictures taken indoors are bad. Too many red eyes , despite using red eye reduction. Will not recommend this product for indoor use."
1,Don't Trust Warranty,"Nice little camera that took great pictures. After 2 months, with camera in mint condition, lens cover suddenly wouldn't open completely. Sent in (extremely well packaged) for warranty repair and Canon said it would cost $93 to fix because the lens ring was dented and it wasn't covered under warranty. When I protested it was in perfect condition, they said they could give me a 10% discount on the cost of repair. I asked Canon to return it to me unrepaired. Amazingly, it now contains a very visible dent in the lens ring. No dings, dents or scratches otherwise. I guess this is how Canon can avoid doing warranty repairs. I trusted the Brand, but won't again. If considering buying, do your research. The internet contains lots of information, including a threatened class action suit, against the Canon A series cameras because of lens problems."
2,"Great camera, bad flash","I bought this camera and used it for 2 weeks before having to return it. At times the flash took 10 seconds to cycle, this is unacceptable when trying to take pictures, for instance at a wedding or just trying to catch my child in action doing something silly. If the flash took half as long to cycle, I would consider it t be the best digital camera I have ever had."
1,It stoped working after 15 days,It stopped working after 15 days. Since I was on travel in different country I happend to pay around 50$ to get it repaired.It is not reliable.
5,One of the best digital cam I've had,"I used to have Powershot A530, but after I lost it, I decided to go with A540 since its the closest to what I had and has higher MP. Overall, the pics are great and its simple to use too... the price is very reasonable for the camera you're getting."
5,Great Camera for the $$,"Best digital camera I've found for the money. Easy for first time users but, high enough quality for some commercial use. As a graphic designer, I use it to create images to help show concepts and to plan photo shoots for my professional photographers."
2,Great Camera - Bring Lots of Batteries,"This is a great little camera. I really enjoyed learning about all of the different functionalities - including playing with the color swap, which allows you to select a color in a video and then then change everything from that color to another color of your choice. Great pictures, good manual control, good automatic control.The problem is that in five days of playing with it and taking maybe 20 pictures and maybe 10 minutes of video, I went through 8 sets of Duracell batteries. So when I got home, I bought some 2400mAH NiMH rechargeables. Took 5 pictures and the next morning it said my batteries were dead, so back to the store it went (I got it from Best Buy, which I will never do again. Their return policy is 15 days for cameras and a 15% restocking fee if it's opened. Costco has a longer return policy on chicken salad)."
4,"Excellent Camera, I'm planning to get another for me","I brought this camera as a gift. But I 'had' to play a little with it, to show them how to use it. the Screen IT's AMAZING!. the quality is great and I love the zoom.I'm planning to get another for me too."
4,All good things come in small packages.,I bought this model after using the canon powershot A95. I was satisfied to find that the quality of Canon remained the same irrespective of the size of the camera. All the features that come with Canon were there and the ease of using the camera did not go down by even 1 iota. All in all I am a Canon customer for life.
1,Broke after 3 weeks,buy something else. this camera complelely stopped working after 3 weeks. I've heard 3 other people have had the same experience with this model. I returned it and bought a Kodak Easy Share- not quite as good but it works and was 2/3 the price.
3,Over priced,"The Canon PS A540 is a great camera IF you can buy it for $129.00, You can buy a Fuji that takes better low light pictures for $139."
4,Great so far!,"I have had this camera for about one month and have loved it so far! It takes great pictures and the ones I have had printed have been great. Because I enjoy art and photography, I love all the extra settings (color swap, color accent, etc). Also, it is great that you are able to add on lenses to get closer shots. All in all, for a lower end camera it is great. I would recommend it."
2,loved it while it worked,"I loved this camera, but it's not even three years old and is dead. I just returned from the camera repair shot, and the woman there told me they often die after three or four years and I could buy another camera for what it would cost to repair this one. This is a lot of money to spend on a camera that will only work for three years, imo. So, now I'm left shopping for another, cheaper camera. If I'm going to replace them every three years, I'd better buy less expensive ones!"
5,Great Little Camera,"For the price, unbeatable. No doubt you will love it. Easy to Use, manage pictures and videos, Picture Quality is great and easy to transfer pictures to your computer . Highly recommend"
5,Superb,Found this by serendipity in the main map shop in Barcelona.I am the Director of a small disability charity and the description of how the author's disabilities led to him seeing the world differently as this superb book describes and then put it into practice is awe inspiring.Should be a core text for anyone in the caring professions so they seriously learn how to empower people by showing them how to use powerful tools to enable change.And I note it is not referenced in the visual anthropology section of wiki!
5,A remain a fan,"Steve Brewer's books always catch me...he is one of the wittiest writers around. I really want to have dinner with this guy sometime. His sense of humor matches mine completely.If funny and a bit offbeat is your style, Brewer is the guy to read."
3,Very disappointing. No effort to remix the music,"I would only recommend this DVD to hard-core blues fans. It is only because I am such a fan of the Blues that I gave 3 stars. Yes, Muddy Waters is a true blues legend, I would never dispute his talent. However, the producers of this DVD did not make any effort to remix the sound. Every song, even those from the late 70's, sounds like the band is playing in a tin can. There are better blues DVD's to buy before this one.Also, there is absolutely no information with this DVD. If you want to know who the band members are, you are out of luck.Muddy Waters deserved MUCH better than this DVD offers.If you are interested in a quality re-mixed DVD, then I highly recommend ""Blues Masters"". Muddy in on this DVD and the sound is outstanding."
1,web site review,very poor display of product and prices. no relation to mfg prod #. Cannot identify to assure right prod.Pricing on Convatec products extremely high. not competitive at all.
5,Ahhh ... The Frogs,"This EP is nothing short of pure genius; the songwriting is great and the sense of humor refreshing. Produced by Billy Corgan under the nickname ""Johnny Goat"", it has a great sound and a very creative feel. If you haven't heard the Frogs, get the Hell out of church and open your damn mind already. Best songs: ""Weird on the Avenue"", ""Raped"", ""Lord Grunge""."
5,I love this yoga practice!,"This is the perfect video to take your yoga practice to the next level. Tamal is a wonderful teacher, with a soothing voice and gives clear instructions while describing the benefits of each pose as you are doing them. He helped me bring a mindful & meditative quality to my yoga practice and his positive words and guided meditation always leave me feeling more at peace."
5,REMASTERED IN - 2006,"Marengo Films remastered these two prints in 2006. We have found new film collectors and swapped prints and the new software is much better than it was in 2001 when we originally put this double feature out... We spent much of 2006 re-mastering a fair number of our DVD's and this is one.I believe you will find both of these prints highly satisfactory and in fact we believe they are the VERY BEST ON THE MARKET.We appreciate your business.Best regards,Marengo Films"
4,Not argue as much as position,"While I was expecting something along the lines of debate tactics, rebuttals, counterpoints etc. this is more of a book that deals with pre-positioning in an argument to get you where you need to be.It did get a bit preachy at times, but overall it was a pretty decent read."
2,I'm surprised at all the stars,"I expected this book to have a little more structure in building and executing an argument but it does not do that. It instructs the reader to be passionate, tell a powerful story, and speak from the heart. This all makes sense but I was looking for a little more practical advice. There are some good segments but in many chapters I found myself wondering if what was written was the author's stream of consciousness at that point in time."
3,Ambivalent Attitude,"Though this book is not at all a manual with a set strategy on winning arguments every time it is saturated with stories and personal situations the author has lived that have allowed him to be successful and give successful arguments as a trial lawer, husband and educator. There is much to learn from the book, but at the same time does not entice us to keep the pages turning. The book could have been 100 pages shorter and probably better. I was not enthrawled with the narration at times, which is primarly delivered to the male audience. Last time I checked people of all genders and races argue. But then again it's a misleading title; Great marketing strategy though! I could understand readers taking offense to certain parts of the novel but it's a lot of opinions. In the end it's not a bad read. The book proceeds in fits and starts. It's filled with parobles, situations the author has lived and quotes that are always interesting to read. It's a decent book."
3,Good but weird,"The gist of this book is fantastic. Learning an important skill from the best is, to me, one of life's great pleasures. His approach to what an argument is, the importance of starting from a place of integrity and hard work - wow! Right on!So, why the three star review?He has a side to himself that he reveals that I found hard to stomach. For several pages, he launches into a radical left wing (I'm comfortable with liberals and conservatives as long as neither is too radical) pseudo-spiritual, anti-business tirade that includes that importance of going out alone into the wilderness and talking to Mother earth and apologizing to her. Had I known it was coming, I probably still would have read the book because it came highly recommended. Still, I wish he'd stuck to his expertise and not tried to enter the self-help, goofy spiritual realm."
3,People don't argue about logic,"Simplicity isn't emphasized, but it is fair for Spence to assume virtually all of the other books on public speaking include banal adages like ""start with an impact statement"" or ""limit your presentation to 2 to 4 main points."" I appreciated him not selling me a repeat of the basics.Spence's point about emotion is no one cares to argue over or hear why 2 + 2 = 4. Consequently, issues worth arguing over are normally decided by a sense of justice, responsibility or the like, which involve emotions. I took Mr. Spence to assume along with his audience, with good reason, that you cannot persuade a jury, judge, board of directors or the like by logic alone. You must address what people care about."
4,Very helpful,Definitely on my recommended book list. A must read for women in business.Susan BockThe Success Coach for Women in Businesswww.SusanBockSolutions.com
3,Rhapsodic writing strains non-fiction.,"I tried to get through this book several times. Finally, I gave up. I wanted to read non-fiction. Spence's style of writing taxes the non-fiction classification through his rhapsodic, quasi-poetic details.The premise is excellent. The author knows his stuff. However, his rentless, never-ending tangential stories and lengthy poetic sentences belong to Herman Melville's genre, not non-fiction. Mr. Spence is an outstanding attorney and an excellent writer of fiction.Spence could have reached the goal of this book in half its length. Read the Cliff Notes version if it is ever published."
2,intellectually dishonest,"I've tried to finish this book 3 times already. Everytime I read it, Mr. Spence's self-aggrandizement and intellectual dishonesty turn my stomach.I suppose my ""emotional quotient"" or some such isn't high enough, but (as others have stated) ""making them feel sorry for you"" may mean you win, but it doesn't make it an ethically correct thing to do. I guess I was particularly disappointed because he could've made a similar point--you must emphatically believe what you're saying--without encouraging people to paint themselves in an artificially pathetic light.Finally, I was most surprised at what a proud man Mr. Spence was. Of course, I suppose that's part of what makes him a good lawyer.To be fair, I did enjoy some of the stories (hence, the second star). Unfortunately, they were often good examples of non sequitors."
2,Long and Tiring,"Although this book made some valid points and had some good info, I felt as though it was long winded and circumlocutory. So-so book that could been written in 100 pages instead of 300."
4,Great Read,"This book is not only for lawyers, but is useful in the many stages of everyday life. While i don't subscribe to everything Spence preaches, the outline and major points are excellent take-aways."
5,Gerry Nails One Of The Answers To Life,"Having a mind open to wonder and not closed by belief is an amazing description for some of us on how we live life. This book is about life, how to win, how to approach arguments, when not to bother, and how to see from another's perspective. What a beautiful source of good stuff for the independent thinker. Gerry Spence wins 5 stars easily on this one."
1,Political Views of Gerry Spence,I was extremely disappointed in this book. It does go over the basics of preparing for an argument (pages 202-204). The other 289 pages seemed like an oversized sales pamplet for Green Peace. The writing struck me like a bad used car salesman desperate for a sale.
1,Please don`t waste your money!!!,"I tried several times to get through this book; but finally I had to give up. It is one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. I do have to give Mr. Spencer the credit that he sure has a lot of bull, and we are supposed to read all 300 pages!! If you doubt my review please read two pages before buying and you will understand what I am talking about......"
5,He puts in words what I wish I could.,"The ""PROFESSIONAL"" from Austin doesn't get it because he's to smart or professional. The professional from Austin reminds me of a friend that graduated from Law School who didn't know how to treat people in the courthouse and therefore didn't get any extra assistance. He would walk into the Clerk's Office and act like he was thinking (I'm a lawyer, anybody here want to bow down, wash my feet, or kiss my ass) THE BOOK IS GREAT. But if you are a ""Professional"" or a recent law school graduate with false sense of greatness, grow up a little and then read it."
2,More about Gerry Spence than arguing,"Another pamphlet book that can be summed up in one sentence--Don't expect to win an argument unless you believe you're right. Great advice, since many people enter into a debate or confrontation already thinking they'll lose, but no actual instructions, just a lot about the author."
2,A few good points nestled among the bad,"While there were a few good points in the book, there were far more bad ones. Among the good ideas were:1. Truth is powerful.2. The use of stories helps involve the listener in a way technical arguments alone cannot.Among the bad ideas were:1. Words are virtually irrelevant- the tone conveys your message.2. The truth can be found in emotions, not logic.3. You can win every time merely by denying your opponent your permission to beat you.I had heard that one should keep one's argument as pure as possible thereby avoiding to needlessly alienate people through issues unrelated to the main point. The author contradicts this completely by sprinkling his liberal ideology throughout the book, making it significantly more difficult for non-liberals to keep reading.In the beginning, the author says that this book is itself an argument. Well the argument failed to win this reader, and thereby contradicted its title."
1,Bad advice,"The author redefines ""argue"" as ""communicate"", then tries to tell you how to ""win at communicating"". He does this by presenting a lot of half-truths and monologues borne of a critically incomplete understanding of even his own example situations. The result is a lot of really, really bad advice.This book is useless as a guide to arguing (or even communicating), but possibly potentially useful in understanding the kinds of broken thinking you may encounter in others while trying to argue or communicate with people of like mind with the author."
2,review from Michigan reader,"While I really like Gerry Spence and when he's on tv, I like tolisten to every word he says, because I think he is a fascinatingintelligent talker, has an interesting friendly personality andI love that jacket he always wears. While looking at this bookin the library, I just couldn't get interested in it, I don'tlike his book writing style and couldn't get myself to want toread the book in spite of how much I like the guy."
1,"Extreme ""feel sorry for me"" liberalism","If you're one who thinks the world owes you a life, or thinks that there is always someone else (a faceless, nameless till) responsible for whatever happens to you in life- You'll love this book. Spence will coddle you and tell you that ""we'll get the dirty bas*****"" the whole way."
2,Bullies are a Pain in the Brain,"Although this book covers an important topic, I found it to alternate between being too serious and too whimsical. I'm not sure a pre-teen would appreciate the book or its approach. One positive note is that the book contains numerous resources for parents and teachers including books, organizations and websites."
4,GREAT BOOK FOR YOUNGER KIDS,"I liked the cartoon explanations in this book, and the way the author explains that bullies are ""self-esteem vampires"" He goes into gang violence and what you should do about it as a child. He also goes into name-calling and general nastiness. I just wished that he would not have said that most children who are picked on, are shy children. In my experience, it is the children who are different in someway (race, religion, opinions, dress, hair color, braces etc..) that brings on the teasing. This book does not address that issue very well."
5,Great for both kids and parents.,"Concise, yet comprehensive. Entertaining paperback with cartoon-like illustrations. Captured my son's attention and taught me a few new things about bullies and safe strategies for dealing with them. A must read for concerned parents and kids who are tired of being pushed around."
2,good concept - but lacks practical advice,"This is a book a child can read, and will gain comfort that he/she isn't alone in being bullied. I don't feel it fully addresses bullying or gives practical step - by - step advice. It doesn't provide several - step senarios. As in, if you've tried our advice and it didn't work, go on to do this next, if that doesn't work, do this next. I was hoping for a book that would address the issue comprehensively."
3,good book,"This was okay book, and I've read a few of them now. I likedthis one because of its humorous approach, however this book has been used so much in a classrooms, that I just did not find anything new in it. It's been out for 15 years now, so some things are a bit outdated based on the latest research of bullies.I also liked the following bully books as well: Bullying beyond schoolyard by Sameer Hinduja, Bullies Never Win by Margery Cuyler and Arthur Howard, The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From Preschool to HighSchool- How Parents and Teachers Can Help Break the Cycle by Coloroso, Bullies and Bullied by Sorsa, Cyberbullied by Sorsa, and Take the bully by the horn by Sam Horn. The last mentioned has the bully book for adults and then a different version for kids. However, all these books are for different ages, not all are for 1-3nd graders, some are for older teens, and some for adults."
1,Broke in the first HOUR! A piece of junk you can buy at a dollar store.,"Broke within 1/2 hour & my son is 13 & was using it correctly. Basically, it's just a piece of junk you can buy at the dollar store for a dollar. Don't waste your time & money."
3,WAIT...,"From acid-jazz back to Bacharach, it seems.When I got this album in summer of '97 I had lots of complaints (""Why is the title track so short/why does this remake of ""Better Make it Better"" have to exist?""). Then I listened to it again...after getting through the first five tracks on this album one THEN gets to what's happening...the ""new sound"". A little further than ""The Living Return"", a sound that one can hear on ""Get In Touch With Yourself"" - a multifaceted, multilayered, yet spacious sound, filled with words that describe experiences that we have all shared (""Drifitng, open to persuasion...""). The next destination for a group that has always been moving in different musical directions while holding on to what makes them who they are. One can only wonder what they will do next."
2,back to the woodshed...,"As you age, your supposed to be less impulsive. A lesson, that with the purchase of this CD, I clearly have not learned. I heard the terrific update of ""Stoned Soul Picnic"" on a ""jazz"" station and within ten minutes or so I had ordered it. I had the first two SOS albums and liked them, so I thought 'how could I go wrong...'Well folks, not one of my better ideas. The basic tenant of songwriting is melody. The melodies on this CD come in a distant third behind overly ambitious arrangements and some of the worst engineering I've ever heard in a modern recording. I can't hear the music for the music, and I wish I could. I would love to hear these songs presented in a simple, clear and dynamic form. SOS's music is full of an optimism that is sorely lacking in pop music these days, but the overproduction keeps me from getting to it. SOS Unplugged? What a concept. In the meantime, I've learned my lesson with the most expensive single I ever bought."
2,SWING OUT SISTER STRIKES OUT.,"This CD missed the boat, and it has been going downhill fast ever since ""The Living Return"". Swing Out Sister has become a characture of itself. This CD is just a rehash of what has once been. If you want something great buy ""Kaledioscope World"", or ""Get In Touch With Yourself"". This CD is fair at best, it is not awful, it just sits there instead of what it should be doing ""Swinging Out!""."
2,Hardly forming,2 1/2Well meaning but ultimately fizzled Soul throwbacks vacillate between funked finesse and waiting-room sheik.
5,1997's Album Of The Year,"Though I sometimes find infectious pop engaging but of limited shelf-life, I still can't get this record out of my stereo. Yes, believe the hype that it does sound like Bacharach meets Sesame Street. It's completely pop, completely optimistic, completely hummable, and emminently satisfying. The arrangements, like Bacharach's, are simple at first, but on repeated listening you realize how masterfully structured they are. Drewery's vocals perfectly match the themes of the songs. If you were born in the Sixties, this is the music you remember. I can't think of a better album that was released last year."
4,Excellent,"Swing Out Sister make old school AM pop, new style. On Shapes and Patterns, they play their own songs, which range in influence from the Fifth Dimension to Bacarach to Laura Nyro, whose Stone Soul Picnic they cover here.You are not going to mistake this for pop from 1969. The production is modern--thick bass and a digital hue. But the writing is as melodic as any high end AM pop from the golden age of top 40.On ""Stone Soul Picnic,"" they take the ending and jam on it for a while, a move not typical of the AM 60s bands they emulate.Nice touch."
5,Absolutely brilliant.,"As someone who has only come to know Swing Out Sister within the last year or so, it's been a wonderful experience exploring their collection. Shapes and Patterns is no exception. I would dare to say that this is the most beautiful album I have ever heard. The way they pack so many different emotions into their work is beyond me. While I am usually too thrifty to pay full price for albums, this one was worth every penny and then some. Without a doubt this is one that will stay with me for many years to come."
5,Great R&B!,"Corinne Drewery and Andy Connell aka Swing Out Sister bring their fans another collection of their personally penned R&B compositions. I love SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD. It has the sound of the late Motown great Marvin Gaye. It sounds just like his personally penned 1971 hit,MERCY MERCY ME(THE ECOLOGY). The other songs are great. Hey,if SOS are R&B musicians,why weren't they signed to Motown like other R&B legends Stevie Wonder,The Supremes,The Four Tops and The Temptations? Motown has a roster of caucasian artists now(originally,all Motown artists were black). Caucasians Bruce Willis and ex-Doobie Brother Michael McDonald recorded on Motown. But instead SOS caught the attention of the president of Mercury records,a division of PolyGram. SOS's fellow residents include Hanson and country star Shania Twain."
