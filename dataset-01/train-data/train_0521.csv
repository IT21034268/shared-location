4,Just outside of the Nashville mainstream...,"New Englander Wayne Warner has a refreshingly down-to-earth spin on the current commercial country sound. He's on the slick side, but doesn't delve into torturously overwritten psychological epics (ala Kenny Chesney or Tim McGraw...), but prefers to keep it melodic and simple, with uptempo country-rock tunes, songs about broken hearts and an optimistic search for love. In many ways he reminds me of old Eddie Rabbitt and Eddy Raven (indeed, before I looked him up online, I thought from the sound of his voice and his phrasing that Warner was from Louisiana...) This is probably too slick for the indiebilly crowd and too plain for the new Nashville scene, but for country fans looking for something nice in between the two, this disc might fit the bill. Worth checking out if you're a commercial country fan with an adventurous streak."
4,Valuable part of instrumental history!,Meek was a bit of a mad scientist. The Torandos brought his crazy creations to life. This is worth a listen if you are into instro music.
5,Filled order as expected,The vendor filled th order as expected. The Bible is the exact format I desired.
5,The bible - la bible - die Bibel,"I think the bible is one of the best-sellers of Earth literature. It is one of the oldest and up-to-date books we have. People hate it, people love it. Some have read it, some have not. Blood, sex and crime! Yes, in the Bible too. I give top marks to this book, because it it the most original, the oldest, the most contraversial and the most complete book I know. It is spiritual, it is sometimes historical, and it is erotic as well. If the Bible was dictated by the Lord - that is only a matter of believe, but advising it to everybody is essental"
2,Inconistent,"This book tells you to use adapt the ""eye for an eye, tooth for tooth""-philosophy, while at the same time telling you to ""turn the other cheek"" and not strike back. Now how are you supposed to do both?I think the main reason for this, and many other inconsistencies (did I spell that right?) comes from the fact that it's not really one book, but a whole lot of books, written at various times, and then hastily thrown together by the monks/priests or whoever it was that was supposed to be the editors of this short story collection."
2,Cute,I thought that it was occasionally entertaining but I really thought mostly it was repeatitive and boring. It's an okay story I guess. I'd like to see some more of this person's work though. Is he/she still writing? I hear that a lot of people really do like this book and I also hear it has sort of a cult following behind it.
2,"Religious Theocracy Beaten By Foreigners, Good Guy Crucified","It's hard to believe that this book is as influential as claimed.It's got lots of sex and violence, so that must be what sells it.It should have been given to Henry Miller to edit- too many of the stories don't fit together logically.Still, if theocratic violence is your thing, go for it."
2,Full of errors and hocus-pocus!,"I found the book to generally be an interesting fairy tail, but it is full of flaws. It would have been a lot better had it been run past an editor, so as to remove some of the obvious contradictions like:""... I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."" -- Genesis 32:30""No man hath seen God at any time..."" -- John 1:18It also gets the formation of the universe all wrong, evolution of humans, etc. Overall it seemed to get a bit loopy in parts, and to drawl on in others. Also highly sexist (wife should obey her husband, etc.), racist, promotes slavery, anti-gay.I don't see how anybody could believe it to be the definitive source of right and wrong when it implies the age of the Earth is on the order of 10,000 years old when it's obviously around 4.5-4.6 billion years old.2 stars for originalness."
2,Highly overrated!,"I found this book to be limited in it's scope and rather dated both historically and in it's outlooks. I think that it badly needs to be updated! Does anyone honestly think that all valid prophecy and moral growth ended 2000 years ago??? We are now SURROUNDED by living saints, prophets, spiritual masters and the like and I prefer a read that is more relevant to my life. However, each to his own, and for anyone who needs to avoid thinking for themselves, it probably serves a good purpose."
2,Poor quality!,"I decided to buy this bible because of the good reviews about it's quality. Unfortunately, the bible I received was of poor quality and finished badly. Very disappointing for a bible of this price. The only thing I like about this bible is the quality of the leather on the outside. Leather on the inside is cut badly and binding is distorted. Every page has a different print quality which is also disappointing. So, this item is not to recommend for it's quality and price."
5,Spectacular value,"I purchased one of these BFM bibles used/blemished, but the quality is so good, that it would've been more than worth the full retail price. It's a very minimalist package, which I like. The font is very readable; the cover is good quality; the binding is tight and sturdy, yet the Bible stays flat with no problem. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.If you're looking for no frills KJV Bible that's inexpensive, yet of high quality, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this edition to anyone."
3,Disappointing,"I buy the Rookie-read-aloud science books for my first-grader, but I generally love them, too. As a series, these books are wonderful. This individual title was disappointing to me and not as good as some of the others.I expected to be shown what things looked like through the animals' eyes. That was done for an insect only (seeing in mosaic) and dogs & cats (seeing in black and white). Other animals visual perceptions were not attempted.Also, I still haven't figured out what animal is on the cover!"
5,Great second set of bottles,"This second cooler with bottles is a lifesaver for a full-time working mom. This way if the dishwasher doesn't get run or the freezer packs accidentally get left out, you are still good to go to work in the morning. It is worth the extra money to have a second set."
5,Westward Journey book 1,I love stories of the pioneers. This was one of the best that I have read in a while. Lots of realism and how it really was back then. I would recommend this to anyone. It is long but It keeps you interested in what will happen next. Can't wait for another one from No Ann Cox. Thank you
5,A child's dream,I bought these for a party favor for my son's 2nd birthday party. The children loved them! We all played Blue's Clues and had a blast. I would recommend this item for any child who is crazy about Blue's Clues
5,Blues Clues notebook,my child is a huge fan of blues clues. the notebooks are hard to find so i was very pleased to find them on your web site. the notebooks were ordered shortly before christmas and delivered much faster that i anticipated using regular mail so i was able to give them as a christmas gift.
3,blues clues notebooks,i was very happy with my purchase it came fast and it was just as i wanted.my son was happy i could not find a blue's clues notebook in any stores but amazon always has what i need.
2,Not so fast...,"Come on! These notebooks are TINY, even for a kid! Have you seen the show? If this is a licensed Nick Jr. product, shame on the network, but I don't think it is. I think this is someone trying to create a ""similar likeness"" to the Blue's Clues notebook and draft off the shows success with an inferior and poorly crafted product. Take my advice ro don't but this Dad says 15 dollars is about 14 dollars too much for this phony clone.Boo!"
3,My son loved these...,"...but they didn't last long. He had loads of fun writing in them and finding ""clues"" while he watched Blue's Clues, but they are what they are-paper notebooks- and the paper ripped out easily and the wires on top bend easily. I would buy more if they weren't so costly, but luckily we've found that our son likes regular old notebooks from the store just as much."
3,Nice Small Notebooks - Can Even Fit In My Son's Pocket,"These are not exactly like Joe's because the red coloring is too brilliant... Joe's were made to look like they were colored in with Crayon. The size is also a lot smaller than I thought, but for my son that is good... he always wants to put the notebook in his pocket (like Joe)Not a lot of paper considering how much my son likes to play Blue's Clues, but getting the 4 pack was a great choice."
5,Bear keg user.,The whole transaction of buying this product to useing it went well. It was received in a timely matter. The first time using it was hugged by a bear.Thought for sure he was going to pop it. Soon the bear gave up and left. Good thing I did have it for there was no place to put a bear bag.
2,Not Impressed,"I understand the concept of this book. Want to know why I understand it? Because they spend more than HALF of the book saying,""The purpose of this book is to.."" It takes too long to get to the point. It has great information about medical procedures in simple language, and some advice about what to expect with a dying child. Overall, this book could have been more. The authors get too wrapped up in themselves and fail to deliver to parents what they keep promising to give. It's a nice book for supplemental reading, but there are better titles out there that will offer true counsel and detail about disease and the effects thereof (On Death and Dying, etc). Also, if you are a parent that is truly struggling with these issues, take full advantage of the Child Life Educator/Specialist staff at your hospital. If there isn't a program like that, then recommend one because those people are true healers."
5,Awesome,"This product is a great addition to any fleet. The picture is misleading though, you do not get that whole box worth of packs, just one booster pack. Overall, this is a great product."
3,A nice summer read but not great fiction,"A fun read for Judy Collins fans, this novel looks behind the scenes of the music business and finds intrigue. Not great (or even very good) fiction, but at times poetic. The dream/flashback sequences tell a more interesting tale than the primary story. Collins' best-selling autobiographies (""Trust Your Heart"" and ""Singing Lessons"") are more worthwhile."
2,Hard to get through,"Ordered this book a while ago and finally got to read it.....Disappointing and hard to put my finger on the problem with this book, but I guess that the main thing was that I just didn't care about the characters....They had no soul and no depth and the story never really came together for me and what was worse was that when you finally got to the end it was just a huge summary with no basis......"
2,Kinda Boring,"This book was rather hard to get through, especially the dream sequences, which I eventually began to skip. Not much happened, other than name dropping, and the end was anticlimactic."
1,SHAME ON JUDY COLLINS,"What a shame that Ms Collins chose to sully her name and legacy with this!She's written some reasonable songs and produced some excellent recordings, how does she explain this travesty?"
4,mgm needs to care about the customer!,"just like the sg1 complete series i bought, this has disks that either skip or the sound just blinks out. im goin to have to send a few back. but i love me some stargate. its a shame the show got cancelled. its the story of my life. the one show i really like on tv gets cancelled. mean while sumthin called honey boo boo is given the light of day... maybe if ever1 buys a copy.. ill get more stargate!"
5,Great series,"I never really could get into the original SG-1 series, just a bit too campy for me. Stargate Atlantis really impressed me though, much darker overall...still not ""dark or gritty"" , but when compared to the original SG-1 seems that way.Most episodes have special effects that are holding up well, the primary bad guys are done really well, and the story line is awesome.I have had the collectors edition for years now and watched the entire series multiple times, packaging has held up nicely"
4,Love the series,"I loved the series, and am very excited to have the box set. Can't wait for the movie to tie up the loose ends left at the end of the show. The product as a whole is great, but the case sucks. It looks amazing, but you have to slide the disks in and out to remove and store them, and this can lead to scratches on the disks over time. I experienced the same problem with the Stargate SG-1 box set. Overall worth the buy if you don't have the series already."
3,Scratched and poor boxing,"This was wrapped and under the tree until I read other people's reviews and saw that Amazon stopped selling it because of quality problems. I opened the box and at least half of the DVDs had scratches and marring. I was very disappointed since it was a present for the entire family. I returned it 2 days ago. I bought it as a Daily Deal, so I guess that I will have to pay more when Amazon starts selling this product again."
2,Poor Box Design Causes Scratches,"I returned this Atlantis complete series collection twice, once for an exchange and then for a refund. Each time because one of the DVD's had one or more episodes that locked up. I think it's because the design of the folders that hold each season causes scratches on the discs. The series collection comes in a box 8 x 11 x 1.5 with the five discs for each season kept together in trifold folders. The individual discs are held in horizontal slits cut in each folder and overlap each other, instead of being completely separated like they are in the box you get when you buy a single season. I do not recommend purchasing this complete series collection."
5,Great Series!,"I was glad MGM released Stargate Atlantis on Blu-Ray. Before, the studio wasn't going to release it. I was surprised they released all 5 seasons on Blu-Ray. I thought they might do 1 season at a time.This series deserved better treatment than it received. It had great characters, great stories, great actors and directors. At the end of Season 5 there were still plenty of stories to tell, plenty of things left to say. It's a shame the movies were shelved (for now, let's hope). Maybe, in the not-so-distant future, MGM will reconsider and produce new Stargate movies."
1,Badly manufactured Set - MGM needs to learn how to produce better box set!,"Simply put, this set is pitiful.The show is a wonderful, exciting product that needs to be respected by MGM.I ordered this set - EVERY SINGLE DISC WAS SCRATCHED!The packaging while colorful and interesting, does not protect the discs.The weird gel disc holder / tray combination does not allow the discs to be held securely.The bonus disc that is exclusive to this set was neat, it had the broadcast and extended versions of Ep 99: Vegas and Ep 100: Enemy at the Gate as well as two exclusive featurettes.I returned the set, Amazon was amazing no questions asked, my refund request was respected and returned no questions asked."
3,"Good story lines, too much fake ""science"" to save the day","Some very interesting story lines and characters. Main flaw is that in more than half the episodes it is Dr. Rodney McKay who, while under an impossibly tight deadline, must pull of a miracle of code cracking/password hacking/insanely unlikely scientific breakthrough to save the day. It gets a bit tiresome after a while, despite the fascinating characters and some good humorous dialog."
5,Ideal Seller,Item was shipped the same day and in mint condition just as they promised. This is an ideal seller!
5,This is what I have been waiting for!,"Finally, we have a Blue-ray HD set. The quality is excellent. The packaging of the product is awesome.I only wish SG1 was in HD, Too bad it was shot in SD."
1,I'll buy it when it comes on Blu-Ray,"Hopefully, the packaging problems with the DVD's won't be replicated with the Blu-Ray disc sets. WHERE is the promised Blu-Ray complete Atlantis???"
4,Check you Discs on purchasing,"The Series is great, if we could get past Season 1 Disc 1! Our sealed box set was missing Season 1 Disc 2 and has two of the Disc 1 instead. In contacting Amazon, they are no longer selling the product and cannot offer replacement, only a refund of what is a third of what other sellers will list it for. When you get your set, just be sure to check every disc as soon as it arrives!"
4,Good series,Purchased this as we are both big Stargate fans and saw the original series; could not find it in Canada this cheap and were not willing to wait for it to come out on Netflix so purchased it. Good show but you have to be a Stargate fan to appreciate.
2,Avoid at all costs,I ordered this as a gift for my mother disregarding the many reviews that the disks were bad and went ahead ordered it anyway.25 disk in the set 12 were unplayable in PC's Dvd players blu ray players..2nd set that was sent as a replacement had 5 bad disks in the set..I just gave my mother the 5 disks from my own collections and am highly disgusted that these disks are so poor quality.Many of the disks look like they have been tossed around in gravel before placing in the holders.I would not order these even if they were 10 bucks.. you might get a few good disks..
3,False informations and cheap packaging,"Beware, if ever you are looking for french audio, only a few episodes have it. It should be written in the product description, as it is written on the package itself.The packaging itself is cheap, many DVDs were not even rightly inserted in their ""compartment"" although for now I still not discovered scratches on them.The price is too high for such a poor quality product. The series itself is good, the problem is with the add, and the packaging."
2,"Good series, terrible packaging","So I like the series, and I'm enjoying it right now. The problem I have was with the packaging. If you bought the complete SG-1 series, it came in two large foldout cases of something to the effect of glossy cardboard. Roughly 3 of the disks were damaged and some episodes wouldn't play. You can see a lot of message boards talking of similar problems.The Atlantis set takes the poor planning a step further. It is broken up by season, but uses the same glossy paper, and now a hard gel-ish holder for the middle of the disc which is both unnecessary and annoying. I don't know if any of the discs are damaged yet, but if I leave them in the current case, they likely will become as such soon.Save yourself A LOT of headache and buy a CD/DVD case at the same time."
3,Problem with disc,Season 2 Disc #4 was defective. Gives me an error code and will not play. Can I get a replacement disc?
2,Disc not working,So far I have had two disc's for season 1 not working. Not problems yet with season 2 disc's. I will not buy from this manufacture again.
2,disappointed,"After having to pay custom duty before the item could be delivered(which was not mentionedin the original listing for it,) the item was delivered. However, I have found the discs to be inoperable on our disc players, as they weresent from America. I only seem to be able to play them on my laptopand even then I have go thru a rigmarole to get them on. So I am not really happy and certainly will not be purchasing anything from them again. I have emailed them regarding the customs duty, as Ipurchased the original ten series box set of SG1 some time ago, from another company in America and did not have to pay customs duty atthat time."
5,Great deal!,I just bought this complete collection and SG-1 and paid way more than this. Good price sorry I missed it!
1,Bad seller,"I am not able to review this item since I never received it. There was a mistake in the address and it never reached me. When I discovered this mistake, I tried to contact the seller but was unable to find even an email. There is no means of communication with seller that I was able to find. I even went as far as contacting the postal service and they put a request in with the shipper to contact me, but there was no attempt at communication whatsoever!!! I will be very uneasy to ever buy from Amazon in the future and if I do I will look for contact information to the seller first and only then place an order."
5,Awesome!,I wish this show was still on air! The blu-ray's are amazingly detailed and clear. I recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it or has. It's a really easy show to get sucked in!
4,Disapointment,"I had purchased all five seasons at a chain store and was looking forward to a number six. I had no computor at that time so didn't know the status or the future of the series. Needless to say I was quite disapointed, as I felt we were left in limbo at the end. I had all ten seasons of SG-1 and felt that this one could have been taken a little farther, at least two more seasons. I'm sure there were others who felt the same way. I've been a lifetime lover of sci-fi starting with Captain Midnight in the fifties. I guess I just have one suggestion, that being, let the public know that you don't care how long a series runs. I'm speaking to the many producers and directors who are no doubt living well in BC or the US, don't need to name names, but when I see them I won't be so ready to view their works in the future!!!!"
3,Poorly mastered,"You get most of the episodes but not all. Packing is nice, too bad it wasn't done professionally. Two more words."
5,Stargate The Complete Series,Great series. The set I received came in great shape. Some have complained that theirs had loose discs. Mine came fine and it was actually difficult to figure out how to get the discs out of their holder. Basically you have to rotate and push the rubber grommet to release the disc.Series is fantastic!
3,"Great Show, Problematic Disks & Packaging","5 Stars for the show1 Star for the physical product (disks, packaging)~~~~This is a really great TV show with lots of wonderful characters and stories. I'm really glad we have the complete set.*HOWEVER*, the actual production of the disks and packaging is shockingly poor. We had to exchange 3 different sets and go through two different sellers (one Amazon, one 3rd-party) to get a complete set in which the packaging wasn't significantly damaged and the disks would actually work (some had programming errors that prevented episodes from playing, some were cracked and un-playable, etc.). Amazon ultimately worked with us to make it right but it took a few months and a lot of patience.If you are a fan of the show, you will love having the series on DVD. But beware that there are some ma-a-ajor issues with the physical product."
4,Stargate Atlantis Blu-Ray Set,I purchased this so I could get the better picture and sound of the blu-ray disks.These have the same content of extras that the dvd's have.You would think that useing the blu-ray disk you would have more content but nothey didn't place anything new on them.The picture is fantastic and the sound is much better then the dvd set is.Is it worth the price?I belive it is because of the better picture and sound.As I said they could have placed more on them as more extras and what wasgoing on behind the scenes.I would rate this a solid 8.5 on a 1 to 10 scale.
2,packaging,"The film is great but the packaging is all wrong. The box does not fit like any other DVD, the disc are hard to get in and out, and season folds don't stay in any sort of order. Must have made great effert to do this WRONG."
4,Enjoyable Game,"I just got this game to take on a long car ride with me, and it's great. It's just like playing in the real casinos, i don't know how you could have a bad review. I guess just maybe expecting they are expecting too much out of a very cheap game..."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I was so looking forward to another Maxie and Stretch paperback...But very disappointed in this book... I felt as if i was reading a travel brochure instead of a light mystery book...I think Maxie needs to get back in motorhome and head back into the continental United States...if i want a guided tour and info I will go to library or AAA...Guess I will have to find another author as I am not into Alaska books or the Jessie Arnold series...
1,Worst Book Ever?,"Recognizing the author by name, I recently borrowed this book on tape from my local library for a LONG road trip. I was sorely disappointed, however. Repetitious details (how many times did we hear the EXACT same description of ""the gun in the Winnebago"" anyway?) burdened the plot, robbing the story of suspense. The book is more a travel book of Hawaii than a ""Who-Done-It,"" ... leading me to wonder, ""Who Cares?"" The title must have been a second choice: ""Much Ado About Nothing"" was already taken."
2,"Show, slow, slow...","I've read and enjoyed this author's previous series set in Alaska, so I was really looking forward to a new sleuth and a new setting. However, this novel reads more like a travelogue with a bit of mystery thrown in as an afterthought. There are endless (and I do mean endless) descriptions of the scenery, the flora, the fauna .. and minute-by-minute descriptions of Maxie's daily activities. The suspense, when it occurs, is good, but there just isn't enough of it."
5,Maxie is my kind of heroine,"I was a fan of Sue Henry for many years and really enjoyed all of her Jessie Arnold mysteries. Her characters are well developed and interesting. It's no surprise that dead north was my favorite book of the series. I have a motor home and understand that kind of travel. I can Identify with Maxie and love her dog stretch as if they were old friends. Now that They have their own series, I can't wait for the next book to come out. The Refuge is so well written and the characters so real that you just can't put this book down. Good plot, great characters, what more can you ask?"
2,Slow getting started,"I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but have to agree that parts of this one read like a travelogue, I put the book down, but then picked it later that night and skipped several pages of text in the beginning.One problem: Maxie purchases a plane ticket for a young man for the same returning flight she will take back to Akaska. The problem is when he disappears days later she does not know his last name. Impossible feat these days to buy a ticket without the passenger's name."
2,Truth in Advertising ?,What I received is not what is shown on the picture. The picture shows rounded corners whereas what I recive has 90 degree corners. I am disappointed and next time I will think twice before I order. Amazon should send me what I actually ordered and did not receive. Look at the picture.
1,SADER THAN SAD,"THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT A GIRL WHO LIKES A GUY HOW LIKES A GIRL WHO HATES THAT GUY. IT HAS NO STORY LINE WHAT SO EVER. I LIERALLY SLEPT HALFWAY THROUGH THE DUMB CAHAPTER, BY THE WHY WHICH HAD NO DIALOG. I FIND BOOKS EVERY BORING IF THEY DON'T HAVE A FAIR SIZED AMOUNT OF DIALOG. I SKIP PAGES SOMETIME TO FIND MORE DIALOG. IN THIS BOOK THERE WAS REPITION. THEN, NEXT, HE, I, AND MY WERE REPETED QUITE OFTEN.I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE KIND OF MEAN. THE GIEL, JOEY, LIKES cHARLIE. cHARLIE LIKE DORAH. DORAH HATES CHARLIE AND JOEY. CHARLIE STARTS TO HATE JOEY AFTER THE KISS SHE GAVE. THE WHO STUPID BOOK REVOLVES AROUND THAT KISS. WHAT BOOK WOULD DO THAT. IT IS A DUMB KISS PEOPLE. GET A CLUE MS. CONFORD, YOU BOOK STINKS!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Canasta Card Sets,Canasta Cards were delivered in original packing and in excellent condition. From date of order to delivery was within acceptable time frame. Costs seemed high for product. Shipping and handling were high for small package.
4,Canasta Cards - Good Deal,The price was so good compared to the other listings for canasta cards it made me wonder what would be wrong with these cards. The answer: Absolutely nothing is wrong with these cards. We love them.
3,Slightly dubious,"Much as I do feel for agents on the run from republicans and loyalists, this book is interesting, as he states his attempts to resettle in Britain, but McGartland gives me the impression that he may be slightly arrogent in some of his assumptions. If you have read his first novel then this is worth the purchase. Be warned though, its not as good as his first."
2,two stars and i am being generous,dead man running was not nearly as good as fifty dead men walking. i found the book to be a bit repetitive and mcgartland refers back to his first book often. i feel he could have done a lot more with this book. i.e. producing a transcript of the conversations he taped and printing the letters he sent to officials. if you want a quick read go ahead with this but first you must read fifty dead men walking to appreciate the sequel.
1,repetitive of the first book,"entire chunks of this book are from the first book, and you keep finding the same chunks several chapters apart. I don't doubt he had a crap time avoiding them all but a brief reminder at the start is okay in case you didn't read the other book. the editor needed fired. It really adds nothing to anything, if anything he came across as a douche bag in this book the first book at least he seemed kinda awesome. This one was to much whining. I get your life sucks now dude but beats the alternative."
5,A GREAT BOOK BY A GREAT MAN!!!,"I met Jean-Pierre in 1963 on the Island of Tahiti. I was very happy to spend some time with him out in the lagoon doing a little bit of spear fishing. The stories that he told about his life in the Belgian Congo were to me at that time unbelievable. I thought ""well this guy can sure tell some tales."" We spent a few days until I had to leave for the Island of Bora-Bora and I didn't see him again until 1967 in San Francisco, California. He was to give a speech at the San Francisco Press Club, and then he autographed his book ""Congo Kitabu"" the same day at a book store. He did me the honor of giving me that book which I cherish proudly even more than 30 years later. I was in my early 20's then and I was proud to have met a truly great man."
3,Bringing Your Family History to Life Through Social History,"When I first saw the picture on the front of this book, (The picture is gorgeous,) I thought it would be of enormous help for writing my family history. I was very disappointed when I saw the original price on this book $19.99 and I had paid a much larger sum. I hope the content will eventually prove better than the price!"
4,Great series,Joanna writes a great series of ultimate heroes. You are so swept up in the story line you are disappointed the story has ended.
5,Touch of Frost,"I've enjoyed all the Touch of Frost stories - what a warrior David Jason is to be still acting in this series at his age! Good for him. He might look more 'mature' than he did at the start of the series, but I think that's the only difference. Good on him!Thanks. Gwen"
4,Good Police Show,"If you like British made police shows you will like this series but if you like all the guns and car chases of the American kind, then you probably will not."
2,Execelent when the DVD works!,"A Touch of Frost is one of my favorite ""Who Done It"" Sleuths. I have purchased over 50 complete seasons of this and other series. The problem - at least a third of the discs freeze up and won't complete. Imagine thefrustration of getting into a mystery and not being able to see the ending! I have rechecked the discs on other players and on several computers. It definably is the discs. And amazon.com will only refund 50%since the package was opened."
5,This book was awesome!! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!,"This was an incredibly entertaining read! Peter David expands his masterful Star Trek storytelling abilities to the Deep Space Nine universe, and the result is a powerful, suspenseful story with a touch of the trademark David humor. Having everyone join forces to stop a psycho killer is a nice break from the usual political tension between the Bajorans, Cardassians, etc. The ending is brilliant! In the unlikely event they ever make a Deep Space Nine movie, they should base it on this book!"
3,"New locale, old storyline.",DS9 becomes the hunting ground of an elusive killer. (subsitute Enterprise etc. for DS9).We have seen this classic type of murder mystery before in Star Trek. If you are a murder mystery fan than get this book.This novel did help usher in DS9's DARKER feel and atmosphere.
1,"Too bad Amazon doesn't have a ""zero stars"" rating option","A couple summers back, I bought a handful of Star Trek novels to pass the time. This was by far the worst of the bunch.If you like really bad slasher movies, then this is the book for you. Author Peter David is much more interested in writing about body parts than in any attempt at recreating the characters from the tv show.The best thing about this book is that I can donate it to the library and they can maybe make a buck or two by re-selling it."
5,He can do Deep Space Nine too!!!!,"When DS9 first premiered I was skeptical. The humans are the aliens? Yeah, right. But then I picked up this book and everything sounded so great I couldn't hold myself back from the show. This is the first original Deep Space Nine books so naturally somethings are a little off (Odo shape shifts into Quark and other humanoid forms, a task which he cannot do in the series). Another reviewer gave this book four stars because of the lack of accuracy, and I almost agreed with that reviewer but one has to realize that David wrote this book with almost nothing to go on. When it was written there had only been one episode of DS9! As I write this there are only a few more weeks of DS9 left, pick this book along with Fallen Heroes to continue the saga!"
3,"Good, but not great.","Peter David explains in his introduction that in writing this book, he was working under a handicap: the characters hadn't been very well-defined by the time he was assigned the task. Given that, he did an admirable job of anticipating the characterizations that would eventually become canonical. Still, the feel was a little bit off. Also, while David does manage to maintain his usual ability to write with humor even while writing a very serious plot, the plot is a little too dark for my taste, and the violence a little too graphic. This is definitely not one of David's better efforts, in fact it's the weakest book by him that I've yet encountered. But even his worst is fair to middling."
2,"TERENCE YOUNG, OPUS 23","Well, well, well. If I'm not mistaken, this film must be the only fiction movie produced by the United Nations. Actors didn't get paid and Ian Fleming supplied the idea for the screenplay. Cinematographically speaking, there are two or three good scenes in The Poppy Is Also a Flower like the attack of the Iranian army in the desert or the surprising death of one of the U.N. inspectors long before the end of the film. Otherwise, the film is rather educational and the point of view not so objective as no one speaks about why there is such a Demand for opium in the civilized world. Already forgotten."
1,Defective disks,I also got a brand new but unplayable DVD. There are clearly manufacturing defects with at least one run of this title.
1,Very poor quality,I purchased this DVD about a year ago and I was unable to play this DVD at all. It is very poor quality.
3,"Makes the job possible, not easy","With 22 acres of thorn trees, I've struggled with many a flat tire. ""Slime"" is an acceptable temporary fix, but eventually the tires must be replaced. After struggling for years with vices/pry bars, I guess I was hoping for more with the mini tire changer. Its great for breaking the bead and removal of the old tire, but other than providing a stable platform, isn't much help in mounting new tires; be prepared to resort to multiple pry bars and a lot of effort (I found that the ""bead breaker"" attachment is good at initially securing the bead below the rim while mounting). Also, anything more substantial than a wheel barrow tire isn't going to seal when attempting to pressurize, even with a ratchet strap (DO NOT ignite ether in a small tire to seal). Save yourself the frustration and use a Slime inner tube (one inch smaller than the rim size diameter reduces the possibility of ""pinch"" damage during the mounting process)."
1,This edition is an adaptation,"This edition is an adaptation, a fact that is *not* mentioned in the item record *at all*. I ordered it, and when if FINALLY came (6 months after I ordered it), I had to return it because I prefer the real edition of a book, not some dumbed-down ""retold"" version to go with the TV version of the story."
1,"5 stars for Trollope, -4 stars for the publisher","Terrible format. The size of the pages is wrong, resulting in lines of text being too long. Paragraphs are badly formatted. It looks like somebody threw an electronic copy of the text into a word processor, and shipped that straight to a print on demand shop. Deil colic the wame o' them."
1,"Beware of ""Bookworms Library"" edition","Note well: the Oxford Bookworms Library edition of ""Barchester Towers,"" is not Trollope's book, but a ""retelling"" of Trollope's work by Clare (RTL) West. If you want Trollope's original follow this link: http://www.amazon.com/Barchester-Towers-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0192834320/ref=cm_cr_dp_orig_subj."
1,"Annoying number of typos makes this ""deal"" a throw-away","Do not waste your money on this supposed ""deal"" from General Books in Memphis. Instead, find a used copy from a reputable publisher. I purchased this book not knowing (because it is not obvious from the website) that it is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scanned copy; I had assumed it was a used book that had been typeset and printed in the normal manner. There are so many typos in this OCR copy from General Books, it's annoying to read and I'm giving up after two chapters. I'm going to throw the book away; I wouldn't give it to anyone else to endure. Do not waste your money on this supposed ""deal,"" find a used copy from a reputable publisher."
5,Politics knows no boundaries,"In this amazing novel Anthony Trollope continues his saga of clergymen of the Church of England in the little town of Barsetshire. A feud erupts when a new bishop and his chaplain, Mr. Slope, demand reforms in the church service. The main players quickly line up in either the conservative or progressive camps, and spend much of their time plotting the downfall of their enemies. While this novel is often called a ""comedy"", that's a misnomer. It is, however, a dead-on portrait of ecclesiastical politics and manners of mid-nineteenth century England, and one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read."
4,Yes,I chose this book because of theauthor. I enjoyed it and would recomend it to any one who enjoys 18 century English novels.
1,Penguins all have tiny type! Oxford editions are all MUCH better,"My review I about the Penguin edition, not the novel. In order to save space, Penguin editions are printed with type size so tiny that it is unnecessarily difficult to read. I recently discovered this fact to my chagrin when I began reading my copy of the Penguin Moonstone this morning. I ordered it not realizing there was an Oxford edition that is 50 pages longer. The Oxford editions are priced just as inexpensively as are the Penguins but have far more pages and a normal, very readable type size.The Moonstone (Oxford World's Classics)I will now order the Oxford edition of The Moonstone; ditto for the Oxford edition of any other work of literature in future. (Just checked and see that the Oxford edition of Trollope's The Way We Live Now, which I just read, is about 200 pages longer than the Penguin edition.)"
5,...How can you resist?,"These are the primest of Dame Joan's recordings...This really is a no brainer.Don't let the price fool you. This cd contains some of the most spectacular coloratura singing that the young Joan Sutherland ever did.I would buy several, keep one for myself, and give the others as presents. A bargain and a half."
5,the best bargain on yahoo,"well, this cost about six dollars. yet it contains sutherland when she was the undisputed coloratura of the golden era. she never sounded that good again. which is to say, this is one of the greatest sampling of la stupenda's art. and she was the quintessential queen of bel canto, perhaps of all time."
5,This is GREAT**************,"La Stupenda is so great here that you really have to hear it to believe it. And unlike her studio recordings, she does not hold back here ( she has wagnerian high notes that shatter studio microphones ). She attacks all the very high notes with amazing precision. And her voice here is fresh, and full of brilliant vibrato. If you think La Stupenda's accomplishments in the recording studio is spectacular, well, you ain't heard nothing yet until you hear this one. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!"
4,Luisito is back and on the prowl!,"This is what dancers of our music are looking for when in the mood to dance salsa. Argueably one of the 3 0r 4 best soneros of Puerto Rico. ""Sin Tu Amor "" is all music for stepping. If you learn the soneos, Luisito (as usual) will give you the words to whisper, as you turn her. EXCELENT!"
4,Very good Bible overall,"The only issue I have is that the text is not self pronouncing, simply meaning there are no punctuations that help a reader correctly pronounce words in the text. This is more of an issue in the Old Testament."
3,Ryrie leather study Bible,"My last Ryrie KJV Study Bible held together for almost 25 years. I was a little disappointed in the two that I recently purchased, one for my son leaving home, and the other for me. We have both had trouble with the cover pulling away and have had them less than one year. Also, personal notes in my Bible are very important and they have cut down on my writing space. I still think this is the best overall Bible made but the company needs to bring the standards back up. If you love the Lord, a Bible has to be able to take a lot of abuse."
2,Disappointed,I have always order my books from Amazon.Com with great success. But I paid for a new Holy Bible : 1611 Edition. I received a used one. Was very disappointed I wanted it for a gift. So I returned it still waiting on my refund.Carole
3,String numbers 1-6?,"The guy that wrote that the book had it all wrong about string numbering (which is string #1 vs string #6)...well, the standard way of noting which string is which, for the last, I dunno, couple hundred years, is this: if you are playing the guitar normally (right handed) then the book is absolutely correct: strings are numbered from 1-6 with number one being the string of highest pitch and which is the one closest to the floor...number six would be the lowest pitch bass string, the one closest to the player's thumb or you could say closest to the player's head. I have a degree in classical guitar performance, but that isn't necessary, as it is something learned in the first lesson."
1,You have got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I opened the package with a big grin...I repacked it within minutes to send back...I must say that no matter your skill level I do not recommend that you spend the money...even if you have never played before this book will only confuse you...
3,America's Naval Heritage,"I started this book and quickly became concerned that it would turn into The Hatfields and McCoys duke it out on the high seas. With the rather lame interaction between the Stafford and Parrish family constantly battling for supremacy over the ancestral home, I was just about ready to give up on Annapolis. Then the book picked up with rousing tales of naval battles throughout American history and the book soon turned into a fun historical page turner. A decent primer for someone interested in America's naval history, albeit with a fictional framework."
3,Decent read,"Not a bad read, good story line, interesting characters, good family saga. By now (2008) it's a bit dated. Navy details are relatively accurate. Good historical fiction, but I liked Harvard Yard a bit better, maybe because it was a little more recent and didn't seem as dated."
3,Nice threading of history and fiction,"The fictitious history of a Maryland family through 300 years and several generations makes engaging reading, weaving in as it does real historical characters with the fictional family members. The maritime scenes and background ring true and the adventure is kept on the rails.Disappointing however was the sharp division between hero and villain. The Stafford family's ""bad apples"" were rare, and only peripheral characters. The central character in each generation was always good and upright. The baddies were bad through-and-through: you knew the Naval Academy bully would go on to something bad like designing dud torpedos. A small blemish on an otherwise good read."
1,Customer,"Do NOT recommend this product for all Walker Game Ears. These batteries did NOT Fit Walker's Ultra Ear behind the Ear hearing enhancers even though description said ""Fits all Behind The Ear Models."""
1,False advertising,"Walker's Game Ear 4-Pack Air Cell Batteries (Fits all Behind The Ear Models Purchased on 09/13/2011)by Walker's Game Ear. These batteries do NOT fit all models. Different battery model and size, it does not fit the Walker's Game Ear Ultra Ear Behind-the-Ear Hearing Enhancers (2 Pack Purchased on 09/13/2011)by Walker's Game Ear."
1,wrong batteries,"I ordered these batteries as a companion to the hearing aid I bought and the two items were linked together for sale but the batteries that came with the hearing aid, LR-44 fit but the extra batteries are too small. I need LR-44 1.5v batteries. The website advertising must be wrong?? why would they send the wrong batteries as a companion item to something that took different batteries?"
1,Wrong product,"Rather than being given the correct product, being ""Walker's Game Ear 4-Pack Air Cell Batteries"", I was given ""PREMIUM HEARING AID BATTERIES by Liberty Hearing Aids"". Do not purchase these if you intend to use them with your earpieces. They will not fit. These are a complete waste of a few dollars."
1,batteries,The batteries were the wrong size for the product I ordered. The labeling said it was for all behind the ear models but were much smaller than required
2,HILLARIOUS,"The CG effects in this movie are so bad that they had me crying and about to fall out of my chair. Children will probably enjoy it because of the ""cute"" puppies as I'm sure that's the target audience but my God it is funny. The puppies teeth look like piranha or shark teeth and my wife and I were laughing uncontrollably while my four year old daughter tried to watch this. If you REALLY dislike someone or just want a laugh you should watch this movie. HIGHLY recommended if you have small children or have an overly retarded and silly sense of humor."
1,maybe for young kids. pretty amateurish.,"This movie has puppies talking with cg generated moving lips, be warned. In other respects the movie is mostly quite amateurish. The puppies are cute and children might enjoy the simple messages of the film."
2,HARDLY A NOVEL AT ALL,More a shaggy dog story than a novel. Really an extended short story meant for publication in a literary magazine or New Yorker.It is barely developed. No question. there are some amusing insights related to obsession and creative jealousy. It can be read in about an hour.I wonder if a new author could have found a publisher.
3,Not bad,"I found this short story (155 pages) quite good. It's about a creative writing teacher called Rowland who glimpses a students (Chris) brilliant work and becomes overtaken by jealousy. The student uses the jealousy of Rowland to motivate him and so at times even encourages the jealousy. As Rowland becomes more and more obsessed with his student the secret of the jealousy and obsession comes out to the extent where everyone knows about it. Slowly but surely both protagonists go a bit mad with it all. I think I would have preferred it if the jealousy thing hadn't been so strong as to drive them mad and if Chris had been painted as a little more normal. Rowlands wife Nina is shown to be awfully passive in all this: Muriel Spark excuses Nina, saying she is already thinking she will split from Rowland but I would have liked her to have done more. In fact, the women in this book were SO weak, all of them. However, as I said, quite a good short story."
3,Pre-Easy Rider Nicholson,"Please don't listen to the people making clueless comments about this film. It was theatrically released in the 1960s and was seen as a departure from the standard AIP biker fare. Directed by Richard Rush, years before ""Stunt Man,"" and featuring members of the Hells Angels, this film featured Jack Nicholson as a potential member of the Angels. There's little ""action"" and the fluid camera movement have led it to be known as ""Hells Angels On Quaaludes."" Not as bad as the other reviews have made it out to be."
4,Adam Roarke has BIGGER Screen presence than Nicholson! !!!,"This is One of Those TRUE GUILTY PLEASURES !!! This even Seems Better then Corman's The Wild Angels Which came out Earlier, This movie shows more of the True Brotherhood of what its like to be in a Real Outlaw Biker Gang !!! There are Even real Hells Angel Alums in this film Like Sonny Barger and Adam Roarke...The Ending seems a little Hurried though, thats my only Gripe...Over all a Great Ride of a Film !!! :)"
5,Hells Angels on Wheels,"This was just the flick I was looking for. A ""bare bones"" biker movie (It didn't win an Oscar, like it really matters). Absolutely entertaining and down to earth, I loved it!! If you like ""B-movies"" get it."
5,A bike movie for bikers!,"Kinda dated, but it has some classic chops and non-stop action. Nicholson is cool as the disaffected hero, and Adam Roarke is, well, Adam Rourke, a greatly under-rated talent."
2,"Oh, Jack you little devil","Jack is sooooo young in this movie, but he's got it, whatever makes a movie star he's got. Saw this with a double feature at the drive-in. Typical 60's bikey movie. What's funny is the so called ""rebels"" i.e. the ""Hells Angels"" are in their 60's and 70's now and those that aren't dead have opened up bike shops. Now they are the establishment!!!!! What a bunch of squares, man."
1,Keep this one on the shelf,Simply long and terrible. I wish I could issue a negative star rating on this one.
3,A Ride of the Times,"The non- actor bikers in this was not the Nomads or Angels. The Angels were only in the intro. The rest of the time they were played by the ""MADCAPS"" of Bakersfield. Look at the patch on the others in the bar fight scene. That says the name.I ought to know. I was and am a ""MADCAP"".PreacherMADCAPS forever"
2,Too much money...,The movie Hells Angles On Wheels with Jack Nicholson (40th Anniversary Edition) was not worth $65...I expexted much more for that price...
3,hells angels movie,I wasn't the happiest about the movie. But it is on vhs and they play a little rough now adays. The person I bought it for was thankful though cuz he had a hard time finding it. thanks
2,Hells Angels fight then ride then fight then ride..........,"First of all, this movie was worth 10 bucks. If for no other reason than to see young Jack Nicholson talking the talk and hitting the road with some real and genuine Hells Angels. Sonny Barger wrote that Jack fit right in with the boys and even had a perfect San Quentin shuffle. Roark's lead role, however, was a bad charicature of the 1960's slow talking ""Hey, man,"" motor scooter types. With nearly no script, and even less of a story line, it's all about these mean dudes banding together like a brotherhood should, rolling through towns and tangling with the local good old boys, or service men, partying with body paints and getting hassled by ""The Man."" The very serious ending actually made me laugh out loud! Dont expect art with this film. BUT, its quite entertaining to us Red Wing wearing motorcycle enthusiasts."
3,Casual Biker Movie,Nicolson could have been a real Angel. A classic for your library. Most enjoyable.
4,Funny old flick,You know I never thought the Hells Angels were as funny as they are in this flick. Most of the extras were actual Hells Angels. You can actually see Sonny Barger in a couple of the shots. This movie will let you see what the original Choppers were like
3,Classic Movie --,"If you want to go back to the '60s then this movie is for you. Put this movie into the VCR and go back in time. Action in a classic way. But again, remember ""CLASSIC""."
3,Not very durable Spin Top,"It's made out of plastic so it can't take much of a beating, but the worst part is that when it hits the ground it comes a part. The top part is a screw-on top that very easily comes off and finally breaks. Lasted exactly 3 hours before my kid broke it. Krazy glued the top and is still usable, but it's already cracked. It's ok if you only use the rip-cord."
5,Duncan spintop,"Very shiney at start, and durable. It is only durable when you use the black rip cord thingy, because when you use the string, it looks like it would break. It works extremely well with the black rip-cord. The top is meant to come off so that you can put the extra string and head in. The plastic head wears-down after a while, and that's why they give you two. I guess it could break, but if you use the ripcord, it probably won't."
4,Great top for beginner and intermediate but the string is too thick!!!,This top has the perfect weight. Its not too light like the duncan imperial and its not too heavy like the blizzard. Its absolutely perfect weight which makes is very easy to pick up off the ground. The top spins perfectly using the string or the rip cord. The rip cord is great so you can keep trying to pick it off the ground until you master it. Also it comes with extra tip and instruction booklet that shows how to do a bunch of basic tricks. Really fun.Now the bad part. The string that it comes with is way too thick. I don't know why duncan gave such a thick string. The top won't spin properly with the thick string. I suggest buying a different string like I did and then it will spin absolutely perfectly.
5,Understanding Jesua Better,"This is a brilliant book which provides much needed background to the life and times of Jesus. It has greatly helped my understanding of the Bible.The stories provide details of the culture and living experiences of those in Jesus' day and by doing so we are transported back in time in a very effective way. My favourite one was the story of the woman who was bleeding and touched Jesus' robe. I didn't appreciate the social stigma that would have accompanied the illness due to her always being 'unclean', nor of what it would have meant to be free. Then there is the story covering the meaning of the 'living water'.If you are interested in the Bible (particularly if you are a Christian) get the book. You won't regret it. I've given 5 copies to friends as gifts and they have all appreciated it."
3,Dissapointed by Viva la Diva,We are all used to great quality work from Ednita.This piece of work could've been much better than what we got. Just a small complilation of her 'best videos' through the years; instead of a live recording of one of her concerts would've been much more enjoyable. This DVD doesn't contain special features like most do; that space could've been used to include backstage/recording studio footage of Ednita at work or composing a song. Quite dissapointed with it and not at the height of something coming from Ednita
1,fugly ugly itchy icky!!,"this thing is ugly, scratchy, doesnt stay on the ipod and pointless!!!!!! dont buy it!!!i give it -100000000 stars-you dont need to know my name!"
5,"Fiction, but great fiction....","I was a big fan of Mike, back in the 80's. I listen to his albums and in 91' I read his book, shortly after I made Jesus lord of my life.I know Mike has made the mistakes, but I got baptized in the Holy Spirit while reading ""The Satan Seller"". So Mike gets credit for that in heaven.Whatever the hipe, ""The Satan Seller"" is a great read and shouldn't receive ""some"" of it's criticism. It is not all true, but Mike's heart has always been for the lost and getting people to come to Jesus..."
1,Ministry based on Falsehood and Lies,"I read this book just prior to the 1992 article by Cornerstone Magazine which exposed Warnke for the liar he is. His ministry may have touched many but my story is one that makes it all worthless. My best friend and I bought and read this book together, he was not and continues to not be a Christian. We had seen signs of occult activity in the hills surrounding our Southern California neighborhood. We bought this book and read it in order to learn more. Several conversations with my friend saw him on the verge of accepting Christ, then the truth came out about Warnke. His opinion of Christians in general dropped through the floor. I was never able to have a significant conversation with him after that.It is irresponsible for anyone to recommend this book without doing proper research for themselves and informing their friends about the facts."
2,Fiction Presented As Fact,"I recently read this book, which had a tradition of being passed around from person to person as a joke. Warnke tries to mix neo-pagan witchcraft and Satanism in ways that don't make any sense to someone (like me) familiar with both. He attacks the use of ritual in Christian worship as being empty, yet at the end of the book he's engaging in his own brand of Christian voodoo - 'calling on the Blood' and such.A 1992 expose in Cornerstone magazine blew the doors off this author's fictional past. Which is no surprise, having read his obviously fabricated autobiography.I'm rating the book two stars, because it's not badly written."
1,Asinine drivel by a charlatan,"I do not write as aSatanist, but as a Christian. Mike Warnke and his books were exposed by the Evangelical magazine Cornerstone. He is not the ""ex-Satanist' he claims to be, and his account of that peculiar religion is badly misinformed.In fact, I suspect that the Warnkes, Larsons and Rebecca Browns of this world do far more to drive sensitive and intelligent people into the ranks of satanism than the collected writings of ""doctor""Lavey. Too many men and women have read this drivel, then checked out what the Satanists have to actually say, and then concluded that Christians are liars , and that Satanism makes sense."
3,"Sure it's a load of crap, but an entertaining read","Mike Warnke's story of Satan worship and final redemption was a great story in 9th grade and we all bought it hook line and sinker. It is probably one of the more readable Christian confessional books written. Later discoveries made that Warnke was a lying con-artist don't even phaze me. The Rosemary's Baby/I met Anton Levay material is pure brilliance. Who knows what could have happened had Warnke decided to be an honest horror writer instead of a dishonest ChristianThe problem of course arises upon conversion. With these Christian confessionals the Jesus part is always terribly boring. The way he presents himself makes you gag with the saccharine tone. Somehow I just can't buy that astrology is going to lead to sacrifices the family dog.However the only confessional book that I read where the person became MORE interesting after conversion was the Autobiography of Malcolm X, and that was Islam as well."
5,Heres a fact..,"Here's a fact, if we stand around judging someone else all the time we would never have anytime to possibly help another brother or sister out! Mike may have his faults, but we all do. If we exposed everyone in the faith for all their issues we would have on mess on our hands. GOD has the final say weather we like or not. Mike has touched on subject matter like nobody else I have ever heard! He has his purpose and he has helped many lost souls come to find their own path with GOD. Keep your eyes focused on your own walk and pray for Mike don't condemn him, he's had enough of that. This book right or wrong, it hits the nail on the head when it comes to the context of the subject at hand. Mike is Mike a human being with thoughts and feelings like any one of us."
2,Great fiction,"Mike Warnke is a great story teller and gifted writer. I read this book about 25 years ago and once I started, I could not put it down. It is very well written and a captivating story. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Warnke decided to pass this fiction as his life story. He was not the first or the last to do something like this, but when a Christian does it, it tends to cast dispersions on Christianity in general. It also derailed what might have been a significant career and witness for Christ. God only knows what might have been for Warnke."
1,pure bunk,why doesn't the guy own up to his lies?why doesn't he admit that it was all about the money?
1,Not a $atan $eller- A Warnke $eller,"It has been several years since the investigative report was printed proving that Warnke fabricated this story. See Warnke's interview with Christianity Today (...) This book implants lies and fear in people's minds. This is deceptive and cruel. It leads the reader to believe that Warnke has proof of Satan's existence, establishing himself as an expert on the occult and making a fortune off this story. It is at best riddled with half truths (...) and at worst purposely spreading fear."
3,"Informative, until you realize much of it is fiction.","I read this book as a junior high student. I loved it! I even saw Mr. Warnke while in my hometown for a Halloween sermon.It is a great story. I was saddened to find out that he had fabricated much of the book, though I have read enough to know that much of the book could have happened. The controversy of Mr. Warnke takes away from the authentication, but the book is still an interesting read."
1,"Sold to ""Satan""","When I was very young, around 12 or 13 I was given this book by my mother who worked in a Christian book store (I have no idea why). This book had a tremendous influence over me. I developed an interest in the occult, culminating with a couple of years as a Satanist.When, about ten years ago I found out this was made up, needless to say I was angry.If you get pulled into lies because someone knows your minipulation button, which for all you Christians is simply stating that your a Christian, then you deserve to be decieved. There has been a long line of people who have use your buttons to blind and fool you, yet you still have those buttons prominately desplayed on your chests.Warnke is hardly the first, and in the eighties it was Oliver North, just recently you were all decieved by W. When will you learn? A bit of skepticism goes a long way: [...]I was thirteen, what's your excuse?"
4,Insightful!,"Business coach Terry Pearce teaches you how to put the personal perspective back into your professional communications. With a credible and authoritative voice, he explains how authentic human connection is missing from today's communications, even though people crave it, especially as they evaluate who they trust to lead them through rapid change. He maintains that leaders who communicate authentically and passionately will inspire loyalty and make their mark. While Pearce is clearly convinced about the importance of inspiring your constituents, the pace of his book won't exactly move your spirit. He walks you slowly and carefully through the discipline he uses to help clients rediscover their authentic voices and craft messages that resonate. His corporate and political client list is quite select, but we find his communication strategies relevant for anyone who is leading change - whether you are building a small community or a large company."
2,For beginners only,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I had to select a leadership communication book to review for a college leadership communication class I'm taking. This book seemed like the ideal candidate and it had such great reviews but...This book is so superficial. There's no depth to it at all. All his concepts are basic. I learned very little from this book. The only good thing about it was that the book's lack of depth allowed me to read it in one day and complete my assignment easily. Unless your a student needing an easy book to review, avoid this book."
5,"Keep ""Leading Out Loud"" within arms reach !","I keep ""Leading Out Loud"" on a shelf right above my desk. As president (leader) of a manufacturing business in San Jose, most of my time is spent communicating with customers, employees and vendors. ''Leading Out Loud"" teaches and reminds me to be clear, direct and effective in my communications. I recommend it !!!!!"
2,You have GOT to be kidding me!,"Like any charismatic, effective, participative, empowering manager didn't already know this stuff? Puhlease! This was a recent flavor of the day in our organization (already passe) which is the only reason I bought this book. Save some time and money and pass on this one. If you are an honest, direct. passionate and enthusiastic person and have any credible values at all, you're already communicating with authenticity."
4,Great Little Saw,"This is the first pruning saw that I have owned, but I am quite happy with it. It seems to be well designed and easy to use. It is sharp as the dickens and it made quick work of trimming small (less than 5 cm diam.) branches from roses and lorapetalum."
4,a lot of power for a little tool,"My arm strength isn't what it used to be, but with this tool, I feel invincible! Folds easily and I stick it in my pocket until needed again. It took me a while, with a few rest times, but I was able to cut down an old Alberta spruce about 4"" diameter, flush to the ground! I found myself looking for more stuff to saw."
2,"Low quality, not all books in CD","This CD has (or should have) the PDF versions of the books listed. However, the file for the book ""As a Man Thinketh"" only has the book cover and the contents is missing. Additionally, the book ""Acres of Diamonds"" can be downloaded for free from the Internet, so I really got four books for the money I paid. I have to say, however, that those four books are complete and I didn't find any problems with them. Total contents of the CD: 3.7 MB on 7 PDF files (the 7th file is an advertisement to resell these CDs)."
3,Get it used,"This book is OK, but very overpriced. It's heavy with glossy pages, and is a real back breaker in a school bag. The examples are ok, but don't explore concepts very far or in depth. I often found myself thinking, ""what about this case, or what about this case?"" and couldn't find any satisfactory answers. It's definitely an introduction book to stats.It has answers to odd-numbered problems in the back. The solution manual for this is not great, and only covers questions the even-numbered problems. How this makes sense, I have no idea.It has some quick reference equations on the inside covers, which is definitely a nice touch. But save some money, buy it used. It is by no means a classic text."
3,Nice reference material but you'll need additional material too,Many of the concepts are not properly explained. You'll need supplemental material despite the fairly complete coverage of the subject by the author. Bought for a fairly comprehensive Statistic course. This was used for my first course in Statistics. They have the basis for a fairly good book but it's not a good book those that use conceptual learning. It seems geared towards more linear learning only. It's about as boring to read as you think such a book would be. It was over $100 a few years back when I bought it but now it's pretty affordable.
1,Is there a solution manual for this book????,First of all I am not a statistics major and although I find statistics to be a very interesting but challenging subject I am afraid to say that so far I have not been very successful .... I need extra help and I have not yet found the solution manual for this textbook and I am amazed at the fact that there isn't one ? Can anyone help me...ThanxNorma_Zuniga@yahoo.com
3,"Way too short, but fun anyway!","I liked the game, it was fun, and somewhat challenging. But when I played all 12 levels and then beat the final stage, I was very disappointed to see that there was nothing more to the game. I beat it in about 2 hours, which isn't really worth paying [for]..."
3,14 year old gamer,"i've been playing video games, primarily as far back as atari, since i was three years old, and have played every sonic game imaginable. And in this respect , having the new gba with very good graphics, i thought it would be much better. don't gat me wrong the graphics were great, but the gameplay... the levels, and even the bosses, were far to easy compared to the old genesis games. all in all the game got three stars mainly for its outstandingly good pictures"
5,A classic!!,I love this game! When I had the Sega genesis this game was pretty much all I played because it was so much fun. No matter how many times I beat it. This has great graphics and of course brings back lots of memories. This game has become a true classic like the Atari games. Very addictive!
2,horrible,THis game is really bad. im a big sonic game fan. The game could have been sooooooooo much better. You are better off getting any other games like legacy of goku or something like that. The minute i turned this game on i could tell that it was bad. I finally beat the game and i was so glad that the game was over. Its HORRIBLE in all
5,Best used with GameCube and Sonic Adv. 2,"Sonic in his prime 2-D atmosphere plus the Tiny Chao Garden make for a great game.Sonic Advance is great for me, seeing as how I never owned a Genesis back in it's day (or any other Sega system for that matter), but I've always enjoyed the rare occasion when I got to play a Sonic the Hedgehog game, and Sonic Adventure just isn't the same... I strongly believe that Sonic is just plain better in a 3-D world."
4,This was the best sonic game ever.,i liked this game because on time attack you get to choose a character and race. When you race you get to run your fastest and go on twirly things that make you run faster.You also get to beat bosses. If you dont have this game you should get it soon.This is the best game!
5,I couldn't ask for a better game! I only played it twice!,I couldn't play a better a better game! When I see people who doesn't like it I think whats up with them! I defently give this Game 5 stars! I don't even have the game! I just played with it with my friend and I fell in love with it! Nuckles is my favorite because he can swim climb and glide! Amy is the weakest but she is still good. She can only run at normal speed while the others have super powers so they have extra speed but she can jump really high. Sonic can slide on rails. Tails can fly. I love this game and I'm not even a fan! U have about 13 levels and bosses in each. Each level has 2 acts. Each level has tons of obstacles that can help you and hurt you. such as springs robots sand lava etc. If you are looking for action and adventure I would suggest this game ages 8 & up. I LUV THIS GAME!
5,Dopeness,yo yo yo this is gonna be one of the sweetest games of the year.Sonic on a nintendo system?????? I MUST BE IN HEAVEN!
1,Truth about the Sonic Adventure game that i bought for my Grandchild,"THis game was ordered used and it did not work, it would play but not save the data, so to the player it was useless. I did not bother to try to return it because i do not feel that Amazon cares once a customer purchases , I formed this opinion from past experiences with trying to resolve an order issue with amazon, if it doesnt work, then you are just unlucky and stuck with it."
1,What's the big deal?,"What's the big deal with this game? It's not fun at all. It's way too fast. I mean, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle was fast, but not like this. In this game, you can't even see where you're going. And there's no explanation for anything. I was expecting a cool action/platformer with a few story segments. Instead, I was dropped straight into the first level with no explanation, and there was no break-up between levels, boss battles, and worlds. I was just so confused. It moved so fast that my eyes hurt, and I didn't understand it. It was a big fat waste of money."
3,good and bad,"At first i thought this was a really great game...then I played it for three hours and beat it. I was much too easy and there were only about 10 runs. In the original sega version, the difficulty was the same but there were a lot more levels which made it a lot better. Overall its a great game but dont expect to be entertained for very long."
4,Amazingly FUN,"I've played this game - and I've got to admit that this game is exciting! I don't consider it to be one of the best, but it's graphics were awesome, including the character's cute expressions and the beautiful landscape. The music was okay, not the best or the worst I've heard for a game. Even though the Chao Garden wasn't much fun, the game overall was nice. I don't plan on buying this game for myself, but if you like to play exciting games, this is the game for you."
3,Good game,"Sonic Advance is truly an acceptable game for Game Boy Advance. It features 4 playable characters that have unique attacks. The graphics are really good and the two player gameply is great. The game also has good soundtrack as well. The only down side to this game is that there are only 13 levels(well 14 if you include the bonus level) that are extremely easy to beat. It's also way too hard trying to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds; plus the Chao garden is pretty boring and there aren't enough optional displays. Don't get me wrong, I have this game and its really good, there're just some flaws you got to watch out for while playing it."
5,Sonic The Hedgehog Advance GAME BOY ADVANCE,"Sonic the Hedgehog Advance is a great game to play on the game system call GAME BOY ADVANCEI give it 5 stars ""Highly recommended"" TO BUY THIS GAME CALL SONIC THE HEDGEHOG ADVANCE"
2,a little kids perspective.,"THIs game is not good.you can not save,or give continues.which as a sonic fan are sad about.The CHARACTERS have not a lot of good powers."
5,sonic game,"this is one of the best games my daughter has ever played.if you buy a used one, it is no difference from the new one. the quality is great, and there are many levels, and bosses.there are different themes for each level to.i bought a used one and this is the best game yet. c:"
5,Speedy Sonic Speeds through games,"Sonic is back in an all new adventure (namely Sonic Advance). Speed through many levels and zones as you and your friends seek to find and defeat Dr. Robotnik who's plan is to use the chaos emeralds to turn innocent cute jungle animals into robots for his army. You can pick a multitude of characters that can do different techniques. Sonic for instance can double jump in mid-air for an extra boost. Tails can fly for a limited time, and knuckles can glide and climb walls. Amy can't do much, but her hammer makes up for that. What's also cool is the Tiny Chao Garden which allows you to raise and train a Chao Pet. (Don't worry, it's not too much like Pokemon) You can even trade with your friends. I really liked this game because of the smooth animation and easy control, not to mention the games not hard at all, even for begginning gamers."
3,"great game, but WAYY to easy","This game is a great game, first off. The graphics are great, but dont show all of what the Game Boy Advance can do. Second, there arent that mant levels in the game, and the game is very easy. I love the sonic series, and i remember playing it on the genesis and dreamcast. Only on this one, I can get through the first 8 levels in about 30 minutes with no trouble, while on the Genesis versions i cant get past the fourth level. If you want a short game that you can beat in a really short amount of time, or giving this to a small child you should try this. But if you have to decide, Super Mario Advance 2 is a much better pick. It has 96 levels, and is one of the best games ever."
3,It's Okay!,"Well We all love Sonic. But this game is not its best. You die way to much!! The game is to fast for you to possibly keep up. But once you memorize where all the obstacles are you can go through it with ease. I like the short game play actually it it helps you keep your hopes up, because if you keep dying you'd obviously not want to play anymore. The plot of the game is not all that interesting but that just my OPINION. I'm 14 and a female so buying this game for a 14yr. old female (I would think twice.)"
2,Don't waste your time or money,"Sonic Advance is probably one of the worst games I've ever played. The game only has about 8 levels, all of which are simple, repetitive and tiresome after only a couple plays. The characters are awful and add nothing to the gameplay. The only goals in the game are achieved through completing impossible skydiving missions that are incredibly frustrating. I have wasted too much time playing this horrible game. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game at all costs."
4,sonic advanced,"sonic advanced is an alright game. it has good graphics and some of the newest charecters. they consist of amy rose, sonic, nuckles, and tails. u go through 6 intense worlds. including an ice world the beach and many others. i would recremend this game to ne1 who likes sonic."
2,BOOOOO!,"I thought this game was going to be an awesome game, but i turns out that its a short and easy game. I guess you can get it if you are going to get sonic adventure 2 Batter for the cube...but other then that its too short of a game."
5,A Masterpiece,"Being a fan of Iced Earth I visit their site frequently and noticed this side project and decided to buy the thing. I have since become a Blind Guardian fan as well. This Cd has no fillers. A great addition to my collection. Hansi's vocals shine wonderfully on this album along with Jon's amazing guitar. I love the lyrics to this Cd, especially Fiddler On the Green and My Last Sunrise. I can't wait for them to make more Demons&Wizards albums."
5,This is the must own CD for every metalhead,"Jon Schaffer and Hansi Kursch definitely put one great musical composition together.I not sure what brought these two together, but it's definitely was a fabulous idea. Being a big Iced Earth fan I bought this CD immediately.I'm not to big on Blind Guardian(that band always remind me of the Tolkien books,The Hobbitt for some reason). I've listened to it nonstop.The more you hear it, the more you going to love it.Definitely a must own. Two thumbs up!"
5,The Best Combination of Talent to Grace this green Earth!,"Jon and Hans! Could you ask for anything more! Great Vocals, and Great music period. That's all you need to Know. Go and buy this album. You will thank yourself later!"
2,Is it 1986?,"Upon hearing the single ""Poor Man's Crusade"" I immediately thought that it was retro metal hour on the station I was listening to. I thought ""Wow, when did I miss this?"" This album is just another example of how the ""Epic D&D Metal"" well was tapped out in the beginning of the '90s.This album would be great if it was 1986. I would've been really, really impressed. I will not be buying anything ""new"" from Demons and Wizards because I'm almost sure I have already heard anything they will ever do."
1,NOT GOOD,"This album blows,do not buy it,there is one good song on the album called Heaven Denies,it's not like it's great or anything but it's good.Hansi does not fit Jon Schaffer's style at all.This isIced Earth riffs with Hansi singing, don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of Iced Earth and Blind Guardian,well not new blind Guardian because I don't like the way Hansi Kursch sings now.This is a boring album."
3,Side Project,"This is a side project for members of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth. It's in the power metal style. Released in Europe in 1999, the U.S. edition appeared in 2000. Apparently on hiatus, no new album since 2006. If you're into power metal, go for it."
4,"Great album, but nothing really new","This album is great for fans (such as myself) of both Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, obviously. It is the perfect mix between the two. You have Hansi's great vocals and Jon Schaffer's wonderful guitar playing (especially rhythm). Just don't buy this album thinking it is going to sound completely different from Iced Earth or Blind Guardian. Nothing on this is really new territory for either Hansi or Schaffer. The songs can also seem a little repetitive when you get towards the end of the album. Still an excellent album though, so pick it up if you are into Power Metal or just Metal in general."
3,Demons & Wizards - self-titled (SPV Records),"Review number 95.A decently done side project from Blind Guardian vocalist Hansi Kursh joining up with Iced Earth members drummer Mark Pator and guitarist John Schaffer.Actually,it's not a bad metal effort,I thought.Tunes I sort of dug were ""Poor Man's Crusade"",""Path Of Glory"",""Gallow's Pole"" and their so-so Cream cover ""White Room"".Might appeal to some fans of Tristania,Entombed,Nevermore and possibly Helloween."
4,True to Heavy Metal Form,"Being a huge Blind Guardian fan, when I heard about this CD I just had to get it and I was pleasantly surprised. In addition to the metal that I knew would be on here, the acoustic guitar parts are beautiful and really mesh with Hansi's voice. About the only complaint that I have is the production, mainly in regards to the bass. The bass is very low in the mix and competes with the furious drums to be heard, losing the fight. My favorite tracks are ""Fiddler on the Green"", ""Poor Man's Crusade"" and ""Path to Glory"". ""Fiddler on the Green"" is just an incredible piece of work, very melodic and a true showcase for Hansi's talents. The album is a refreshing, unabashed metal fest that doesn't pull any punches nor does it pretend to be anything glorious or pretentious. All in all it is just a well done slab of traditional metal with incredible vocals."
5,A well-blended mixture of fury and melody,This release from John Schaffer of Iced Earth and Hansi Kursch of Blind Guardian is unbelievable. It so well structured musically. The fury of the rhythm on all of these songs gives me that feeling of my hairs on my arms standing on end. This is such a phenominal CD and it a shame this does not get airplay on the radio. I am a huge Iced Earth fan that is why I picked up this CD in the first place. I have since became a fan of Blind Guardian. The golden voice of Hans is just simply amazing. I haven't heard a voice this powerful since Matthew Barlow of Iced Earth. Make this purchase. I swear you won't be disappointed.
4,Peters Review,"Being a huge Blind Guardian fan, and not really an Iced Earth fan, I initially found the distinctively IE guitar sound a little hard to get used to. This CD has a much gloomier, heavier sound than BG fans are used to. However, Hansi's vocals are as powerful and magnificent as ever, and most songs have strong melody lines through the choruses. After several listens this cd now rates highly in my collection."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"Wow, I heard about this CD coming out, and knew I HAD to get it... Being a fan of both Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, I was sure I was not gonna be dissapointed, and I defenitely wasn't! This has to be one of the BEST metal recordings this year! All fans of TRUE heavy metal should go pick it up, you WON'T be dissapointed, EVERY song is just incredible, some slower, some faster, but ALL are powerful, and show incredible musicianship, these guys can PLAY.. The lyrics are well thought out too, not just mindless lyrics about death and the like... I would have given it 10 stars, but five is all I am allowed, so... Anyways, ALL fans of true power metal, GO buy this CD, you WON'T regret it.."
3,Decent,"The collaboration between Jon Schaffer (Iced Earth) and Hansi Kursch (Blind Guardian) is a decent attempt at melding the two bands together. Unfortunately, it's neither Iced Earth nor Blind Guardian, but rather, somewhere in the middle with a very vanilla flavor. Hansi has one of the best voices in rock music, but the production is weak (are the clicking noises supposed to be the drums? ), and the songwriting is mediocre. These guys are trying too hard to hold onto the 80's. Time to move on. Jon and Hansi are both capable of creating newer and more innovative music. ""Demons and Wizards"" will shortly be forgotten and filed under forgotten 80's metal along with about a million other bands."
1,Pretty silly,"Dear God, it's like listening to a Spinal Tap album. Cut down on the Dungeons and Dragons, and stay away from Renaissance Festivals, guys."
5,Diffrent like this = Great!,"I usually listen to a bit harder, deathier, stuff. Like Dimmu Borgir, Quo Vadis, Testament, etc.But when I downloaded this cd from a newsgroup, I got stunned by the amazing mix of a kind of folk(is this the right kind?) music & metal.So I rushed to the local metal store & bought it.It's #*(&! good! Buy it!"
4,A great buy,"If you're wondering what the album sounds like; it's basically Iced Earth's music with Blind Guardian's vocals. That sums it up right there. Infact, if Matthew Barlow was singing instead of Hansi, you could pass this off as a new Iced Earth album. The only problem is that a few of the songs can get alittle boring."
5,Excellent,"This cd is great. Very powerful and melodic, it combines the best features from Iced Earth and Blind Guardian, on each and every track. The insights of each of these two geniuses are clearly seen on this album. Both the guitar work and the singing are outstanding. Any fan of any of Schaffer's or Kursch's music has to buy this cd. It will not disappoint."
3,It's.....okay,"Iced Earth guitarist, Jon Schaffer, and Blind Guardian vocalist, Hansi Kursch are both rather talented musicians...but this effort shows neither of their talents to any great effect.While both artists show competence, for some reason it rarely seems to shine through most of the CD's ""mired in the 70's sound"". It really is a shame, as one would think that this would be something very exciting, but stangely...it's just ok.Perhaps if they work a little longer on the songs next time."
5,"Awesome album, a must have for any metal listener","I listen to power heavy progressive and pretty much any other metal there is, 2 of my fav bands are Iced Earth and Blind Guardian. When I heard that two of my fav bands were making a side project I had my doubts because I wasnt sure that mixing their distinctly different sounds together would make a good album... I was wrong. This CD is one that is hard to find bad tracks on... even the intro ""song"" is awesome, My personal favs are Heaven Denies, Blood On My Hands, Fiddler on the Green, Tear Down the Walls, Gallows Pole, Winter of Souls, and Poor Mans Crusade... and those are just my favs, the rest of the songs are really good. This CD is much better if you listen to it from start to finish. Buy it now, and all Matt Barlow Iced Earth albums, and all Blind Guardian."
1,A Contradiction without Peer,"This book which supposedly supports science and the scientific method often uses trivial rhetorical methods from the school yard. Long difficult quotations are taken out of context, not just that of the book's argument (which most clearly never bothered to try to understand) but out of the philosophical traditions and vocabularies. Such an idiotic method could render any field incomprehensible. This is neither rational nor fair, but it seems deeply contradictory in a book that claims it wishes to hold the standards of ethical academic work! However, that would be bad enough if -- in most cases -- the authors bothered to actual perform an analysis but no. In many cases, they just re- contextualizes a passage and then, with no pause, just jeer. I am horrified to see the praise for this sloppy and self satisfied hypocrisy. Sadly, hubris is the primary tool of this text."
2,interesting but Misguided,"Noretta Koertge is somewhat engaging but fails to make a strong case. Too many people seem to form knee-jerk opinions about these issues, which only leads to misunderstandings by both sides of the debate.Ian Hacking's The Social construction of what? and Michael Ruse's Is Evolution a social construction?, treat the issues with honesty and fairness. Both these men have a firm background in science as well as philosophy.So rather than snorting and sneering about the perceived attack on science and reason, readers would be well advised to look into the so called "" science wars"" a little more deeply."
4,dis movie kicks ayse,i wasnt expecting to like it nearly as much as i did. i settled in for a pulpy good time and instead was treated to something like cormac mcarthy writes jaws with a dog directed by sam peckinpah. its pretty dope. the packaging is ill. and the disk has some good features. -interesting interviews and the like.all around a deal.
4,Leave It To Stephen King......,"Another great story from Stephen King! Good thriller although not a horror movie. Dee Wallace Stone's character and her son find themselves trapped in her car at the home of a local mechanic who has worked on her car, however no one is home..... except for their ""killer"" dog Cujo! Great scenes, scares and thrills in this one. Good acting by everyone..... especially the Saint Bernard playing Cujo. A must see for Stephen King fans... although I'm sure every Stephen King fan has seen this movie by now. But even so, you don't have to be a S. King fan to enjoy Cujo!!!"
4,Studio rips off DVD owners again! >:o(,"The movie pretty good, I'm a bit disapointed they didn't follow the book ending, but that's a minor complaint. It is also a bit dated, but still a worthwhile film. What ticks me off is the studios releasing DVD's that look like 10 year old VHS copies. DVD Should be crystal clear! The picture here is as fuzzy as the dog!"
2,A let-down.,"Having read the book, which is a classic and truly terrifying, my expectations for this film were high. The idea of a family pet becoming a salivating monster is still a scary thought, but unfortunately the film fails to deliver. The 'cute' scenes involving the young boy and his father really have no business in a horror film. And the characters who die are all so obnoxious you couldn't care less about them anyway. In fact, Cujo, far from being frightening, comes across as the only sympathetic character in the entire mess. Added to that are the facts that the scenes in the stranded car drag on and become tedious, and that the 'surprise ending' is pointless and idiotic, and you're left with something which isn't worth the bother."
1,Item not received,"I cannot comment since I have not receive my shipment since I purchased it on Oct 31, 2006. Still trying to find out where it went to."
3,3 of 5,"There are worse situations a person can be in, but being trapped in a broken-down Pinto for several hours with a rabid Saint Bernard trying to kill you every time you try to escape is pretty bad. Having an annoying crying kid with you is even worse. That's the situation Fonna Trenton finds herself in one hot day. And if she doesn't get her son, who's dehydrated and apparently asthmatic, to safety soon enough, he will die. The movie should be mostly that, but it's not. The car doesn't break down, thus the suspense doesn't really begin, until pass the half-way point. Everything before comes across as a prelude; one that involves Donna's irrelevant marriage troubles and goes on for too long.marcellee.com"
2,"Bad, very bad.","I enjoyed the novel, I really did, but this film is just awful. All the scenes are abrubt and the dialogue is choppy.It was like reading the novel with only a quarter of the events and one eigth of the believability. I can't believe I kept this movie for some many days past its due date. The best actor has got to be the director, who actually convinced a company that he was competent of directing a film. I'm not a harsh horror critic, im a big fan in fact, but this is just unconvincing and bad. Read the book, but leave it at that. Your imagination way outdoes this film."
1,Maddogg Muttley..*woof*,"This has got to be one of the worst made movie of a Steven Kingnovel ever. It's about a St.Bernard that's chasing a lil bunnyrabbit into a hole and then sticks his bignose where it doesn't belong,A Bat Cave. The dog then gets bitten on the schnoz by an angry bat, and yep thats the whole pitcher right there.A slobbering mess of a movie. Watch it if you like Dee Wallace.Otherwise avoid this rabid muttley mess. It's definitley lostit's bark"
1,Be Warned,Contains scenes of woman abusing helpless dog. Obnoxious kid who should have spent more time with the dog. Ending that had the crowd in the theatre cheering and me booing. Wife hit me with her purse and dragged me out by the ear. No happy memories.
4,Early King at his finest,Although the digital transfer to BluRay is far from perfect and you can tell it's release was more to grab a fast dollar then to give the customer a quality transfer I still picked this one up. Price was low and as DVD is quickly going the way of VHS it was a good time to ensure I could enjoy one of my favorite Stephen King flicks for years to come...
2,King Adaption,This is adapted from a Stephen King novel about a killer dog. King is the most popular name in horror. As a straight horror film I thought it was depraved. A mother and son are pursued in a car by the dog for several minutes. Contains dog on man violence.
2,YAWN!,I'm not a fan of Stephen King film adaptations. The only one I like is Carrie bec it was directed by Brian DePalma and featured terrific performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful. I couldn't wait for it to end. Not worth purchasing. Okay as a rental.
1,sucks!,"I'll cut to the chase....Plot ..., movie ..., not scary, will put horror fans to sleep...BAD MOVIE!"
3,"Cujo's bark is fierce at first, but loses its bite at end","Let me begin by simply saying this: If you've read the book and you enjoyed it, you may not like this adaptation. It moves too quickly. The affair between Donna and Vic is not explained well enough. The dog scenes were pretty good and gory, but otherwise it's a pretty average film. The book is far better. As for the ending of the film, I don't like it. However, there have been worse adaptations of Stepnen King novels (remember ""The Running Man?"")"
4,Loved it. I was scared. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! LOL,"If I had read the book first, I would have known what I was in for when I sat down to watch the movie. I claustrophobic, and scared of being ravaged. To me claustrophobia is a nightmare, and it is a great part of this movie. If I had been a kid, I would have not wanted a dog after this. A good, Scary film."
2,"A four-star short subject, a two-star feature",The first hour or so of CUJO basically kills time. Then comes the exciting part where the rabid St. Bernard dog terrorizes a mother and child who are trapped in a stalled car. That half-hour would have been a scary short subject but sitting through CUJO's boring first hour made me wish I was late for the movie.
2,The book was a million times better,"This movie was pretty bad. the book was much better. i read the book when i was ten and loved it. i ordered the DVD because i loved the book so much. It was to bad i did because i thought the movie was pretty bad. The dog that played cujo was so small, he's supposed to weigh 200pounds and be the size of a horse. I felt so bad for poor Cujo though. What suprised me the most was that the DVD had no special features, not even a theatrical trailer! if u wanna read Cujo read the book first."
4,Excellent Movie!,"This was a movie that will get your imagination clicking.Thelead character,Cujo, is a family pet(a St. Bernard). Cujo is bitten by a rabid bat. Cujo turns from a loving pet into a rabid killer. Cujo kills several neighbors as a result of rabies.Noone is safe from the giant dog. A woman and her son are trapped in their car by the killer dog. This movie will frighten you.It is scary but very watchable. This is a movie that you will always remember and will enjoy watching.Buy it."
3,"CUJO, a great Movie but what happend to the DVD?","CUJO, a truely gripping and terrorfying movie experience. When i first saw it i was so scared i nearly cried with fear. Now however that it has seen the light of DVD, i wonder to myself what went wrong? The Sound and Picture are very good even though its presented in Mono, its not in Widescreen which is dissapointing and as for the Extras, what Extras. Theres just nothing on this Disc. All we have here is the scene index. It still is an essential if your a Dee Wallace fan like me but nether the less a Disc with no Exrtas can be a dissapointment."
5,Everyday fears,"The film can appear quite dated when compared to some of today's (2011) more sophisticated camera wizardry. However, the storyline and scenery used for filming make this movie eerily believable. No ridiculous blood and guts, but all the more scary because it has an everyday feel about it."
1,Probably the worst horror flick I've seen.,"""Cujo"" is such a poorly-made horror flick that isn't even really a horror film at all. It's more of a family melodrama turned bloodfest. In the first half, there's no humor or personality in the characters at all, so when the last half begins you start rooting for the dog to kill the annoying son and neurotic mother. Which brings me to the acting. This movie has got maybe the most annoying kid ever in a horror film, Tad Trenton. Even when the dog attacks don't occur, he whines like a baby. Such poor acting, huh! I was kinda waiting for Michael Myers to come knive him to death. He was THAT bad! He was not likable, humorous, or real; just a whiny baby that his mommy should have spanked HARD! I've never been so hard on a child character in a movie, but Tad in this movie deserved to get his comeuppence, which unfortunately, he didn't. When it comes to a scary movie, this one just let me down and wasn't scary at all."
1,Mostly A Complete Bore,"""Cujo"" is about a rabid St Benard who turns on a woman and her son, adopted from the Steven King novel. Not much to say about the film. It's rather boring with notthing to grasp your desire for entertainment, save where the dog makes a few scary poses. The actors do little to enliven things or make sense of it. Plus the direction, story and editing is often sloppy and nonsensable. Plus, I've sworn the the blood in the gory scenes looked orange instead of red for some reason. In the end, ""Cujo"" is often forgettable and is more likely to put you to sleep than scare you."
3,A solution to the problem....,"The problem: You're in the middle of nowhere, trapped inside a broken-down Ford Pinto. On the outside, a huge, rabid dog who wants to kill you. On the inside, the most annoying child ever born.Solution: Toss the kid out the window and run like hell.End of movie. Thank you"
1,"Misleading photography of the product - Shows 3 pieces, delivers just ONE",Every buyer should be aware of the fact that what the image of the product shows is not what is actually delivered. I bought it thinking of a 3 pieces set according to the image shown. For my surprise AMAZOM only delivered one single piece referred to as STD 977115. It is neither legal nor fair to use such strategy to grab the attention of potential buyers. Please be aware of such strategies and check the descriptions meticulously before ordering. The product itself is very good though!
4,The Legend Is Born: Ip Man,"This movie tells about the life of the Ip Man, how he mixed two great martial arts technique's. And becomes one of the great's Martial arts Master of his time to this day. In the story Ip Man is betrayed by his 1/2 brother. The Chinese and Japanese where at war at the time Ip Man was growing up (Ip Man was Chinese) he had to fight the against Japanese and help out the Martial art school he was attending."
2,Camera Speed ruined the action sequences,"This kid's talents and efforts don't hold a candle to Donnie Yen. When Yen, Jet Li, Bruce Lee made a film, one could appreciate the natural fluid movements of the martial arts choreography. This film looks hopped up on Camera speed ( similar to how Jason Statham ruined Transporter 3 ). It took way too much away from the action sequence as it is appreciated and intended to be. The story line was fine....Ip Man's young character was fairly well done. But as said earlier....Yen had to be shaking his head in disappointment that the filmography was not properly continued."
4,Good Film,When I watch movies like this I mainly watch them for the fighting and action. More fights would make me give this 5 stars but it had some slow parts but overall a good film as are all of the IP man movies.
4,Iip Man Legend,The item came in a nice clean package and it was on time. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Ip Man...Awesome!,"This edition of Ip Man was very good. I think Donnie To did a good job recreating Ip Man. He's not as fast as Donnie Yen but he did alright. I especially liked the part where Ip Mans' son, Ip Chun kicked his Donnie's butt. It made for a lighthearted break in the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. I've got the first two on Blu-ray & this one too. If you get this one, you've got to get the first two. It's some of the best Wing Chun you'll ever see."
4,Good movie to watch,"Good movie to watch. I know the voices do not match the characters when using the 'English 5.1' audio settings, but other than that, it's a good movie to watch."
1,"Amazon sold a Factory Mistake, Seller won't fix it...","Normally I would have given this a 5 star rating, since I own the series, but I received one of the videos with NO SUB TITLES, and NO ENGLISH at all, it was all in Chinese, which from an action and story perspective was great, because it really filled in some background and was great to watch, but with out the subtitles it was useless to me to really follow. I usually watch the movie reading subtitles first, then I play the movie again to really watch the action....This whole thing is really distracting and upsetting that no one is willing to step up to fix this issue."
3,great action with an all right story.,there is lots of great action on this dvd but the story compared to the first two is a little off base not to mention the continuity is messed up.
1,Not currently compatible with Mac OS X v. 10.4.8 and later,"Adapter does not work with my MacBook running OS X version 10.4.10 due to driver incompatibility.StarTech technical support advises ""kernel change"" beginning with OS X version 10.4.8, probably is causing incompatibility and they're working on patch as of 24 Jul 07.Full marks to the responsive, knowledgeable tech support team but this product's not targeted to Mac users in other ways: 1) inaccurate installation instructions; 2) software provided on mini-CD not playable on MacBook (requires CD player that ejects a drawer/cupholder); 3) necessary installation files hidden in nested folders with cryptic titles.So Mac users, before you order this USB to Ethernet adapter, recommend you check with StarTech on current driver compatibility with your OS version and be tech-savvy enough not to need the manual."
1,Not what it's advertised to be,"This is advertised as a folding door. It's sold by a second party, Bic Supper Stores, not amazon.com. It's discribed as a folding door and also says it comes with two side extensions for wider door openings. After what seemed like a very long time I received the two extensions. I figured they were shipping it in two shipments. After not receiving the for awhile I contacted them and was told that the add wasn't written properly and that I was actually only ordering the extension. My account was credited and they told me to throw the extensions in the garbage. I just looked it up and it is advertised and discribed in the same way but is no listed as currently unavailable. Not a big surprise. I did give them zero stars, but they won't allow that. That's the only reason they received one star, which it doesn't deserve."
4,A refreshing experience in the art of hip hop,"I've been listening to this CD for about a month and a half now and it is truly a good album. All the beats are original, and these cat's rhyme styles are unique. I first heard Pigeon John on LPG's album, ""Earth Worm"", on the song ""Judge Not"", and I thought the brother was the flyest emcee this side of the equator. Later, I aquired a three song demo tape of Brainwash Projects which sounded real smooth and jazzy. Furthermore, I must say that brother B-twice is quite talented in the art of microphone manipulating, colaberating heart and mind with a nice constant vocal tone and percise lip and throat movements. Over all, non of the beats are wack and these two definately keep it realistic in their verbal exressions. I would say this is one of the most realistic portrayals of two emcees surviving in a world that portrays very few real emcees."
3,good chair but too expensive...,I had this chair at work and it was a gread chair. Comfortable and strong. It was firm frame but the fabric in the seat and back gave it a hammock or bungie feel so it was also comfortable. I want this chair for my home office but nearly a thousand dollars is a bit over my budget.
5,Practically Eliminated my Dogs Gas,"I have a young Weimaraner and his gas post-meals was embarassing.After talking with my vet and experimenting with different solutions, I used this supplement. After acclimating to the supplement, the gas was vastly improved. He has a pretty voracious appetite, but if I sprinkle this powder on top he is more than happy to chow down as usual. There were no negative side effects.As a random note, the scooper in my first container was buried halfway down."
3,Didn't Like It,"Have two dogs. One absolutlely hated it and wouldn't eat if it was on the food. The other will eat anything - so I guess she liked it. So, even though it is a substantial amount of supplement and seems to have an ample number of beneficial ingredients, if your dog won't eat it, you are stuck. Just wanted you to let you know - it may be a problem. I going to try mixing it with yogurt, but it's extra effort than just having them enjoy it."
5,great stuff,"I have used Nupro for years.It has been hard to get.So glad to find it again.My dogs all liked junk food,so I found Nupro,now they can eat their junk food and still be healthy.I wish they made it for people.Way to long a list of all the good stuff it has in it,just know,its natural and great for your fur-babies"
1,No noticable value,"A friend's dog had skin problems similar to those my dog has experienced. My friend said that these skin problems had been solved in the course of just a few days by this product. I have tried it with my dog, and, in three weeks have noticed no change. We still have a long way to go to use the entire 5 lbs., though, so this review may be premature"
1,Questionable Results,"I have been using this product for several weeks and so far there have been no noticeable results. That, coupled with receiving and getting billed for TWO large cans (which should last until the end of the century), make me a skeptical user of this product. The coat luster on my little Bichon and the incessant scratching has not improved. Looks like the money might have been better spent on a vet!"
3,Can't Tell,"Been using the stuff for two weeks and I really can't tell a difference with either of my dogs. They do like the flavor, but it smells a bit."
3,No change in my dog,"We have been using the product for several weeks now and our dog still seems to be itching and scratching as much as before. In addition, her gas smells pretty bad. We are discontinuing the use of it."
3,Not all dogs like it,"I read other reviews where people some people said their dogs loved it, and others that their dogs hated it due to the strong smell. I bought it as I have a dog fighting cancer, and, unfortunately, he will not eat food when I put this on it. I suggest anyone who tries it start with the small size and not the 5 lbs. one like I did."
4,Serious stuff.,"I started my French Bulldog on the Nupro Supplement, combined with a no-grain all natural kibble when he was about 12 weeks of age. He is now a little over 4 months and his coat is very healthy and shiny. His exposed skin on his belly and in his huge bat ears are the perfect shade of gray. No redness or irritation at all. When awake, he has a tremendous amount of energy and runs and hops around the house like he's the happiest dog in the world. I add water to the mix, along with other supplements (please give your dog bonemeal in addition to this), to make a great gravy that he just loves. It never takes him more than 5 or 10 minutes to eat his whole bowl. I highly recommend this supplement."
5,Amazing Difference!,"I adopted a rescued greyhound. For the first couple of months I had her I wondered why she had a bald tummy, a bald butt and stiff, wiry fur on the rest of her body -she didn't feel like the other greyhounds I had met. I tried several different types of foods, but didn't seem to help. I added the NuPro supplement on the advice of my vet and the difference is amazing! After using it for a couple of months her fur has turned silky soft and her bald spots have all filled in nicely. No more bald butt! I highly recommend this supplement. I'm sure it not only makes her look better, but she must feel better, also. If you want a healthy dog that feels as good as she/he looks, you should try NuPro."
2,Issues with loose stools ...,"I use this as a supplement because I home cook for my dogs ... but I have a foster sheltie and my parents Sheltie visits and both of them got horrible loose stools (even bloody) when trying to use this. On my own dogs which are around 30 and 40 pounds, I give them about 1/3 the required supplement or they also get loose stools ... There is good nutrition in this stuff, but something definitely upsets the dogs stomachs, especially at the recommended dosage!"
2,GSD refuses to eat,"I have tried everything from small doses to using other foods to camouflage the Nupro. Nothing works. My GSD refuses to eat this product. My GSD will devour his food otherwise. He will also eat his food with liberal amount of salmon oil on it. He simply will not eat his food with Nupro. If anyone has a suggestion, please advise. I plan to try another supplement."
5,soft and shiny coats,"I have 5 dogs, all different textures of coats. Since using this product, there is a difference in all 5 dogs. They all have shiny, soft coats. Before, they were not shiny and rough to the touch. Also digestion in all 5 dogs is very good, firm smaller stools, and less smelly."
4,close & comfortable,this thong underwear is very comfortable and very snug to the crotch and buttocks. i like that. thank you.
4,comfortable,"I don't suppose these will wear very long but hey, they are just underwear. Very comfortable and fit well"
4,"Some obscure tracks, definitely lost hits","I love the fact that this is one CD that non of the tracks are featured on any other compilation that I own. Especially the Cheryl Ladd track and the song ""I'm Not Lisa."" This is worth it just for those two tracks alone."
1,Complete bust,"The product would not load on my computer, so it was a complete bust. However what should I have expected for one cent plus shipping."
1,Tag Heuer Automatic - forget it - not worth the money,"Tag Heuer Aquaracer Automatic - forget it - not worth the money. Even if wound and you wear the watch it does not run for more than 8 hours. Was told by the salesperson the reserve is 30 - 40 hours. The watch never continue for that duration. When contacted Tag Heuer customer service, what a joke. I could return the watch for 'repair' at my expense. Please understand the watch is less than a month old. Talk about a run around from customer service. What ever happed to customer service?Save you hard earned money buy anything besides a Tag - more hype than anything else. You would think Tag would help resolve the issue - nope."
1,Is Ken Hensley really on this album?????????,what a piece of [junk]...!! I have been a Heep fan for over 30 years and this was their worst album ever! Where did they they find that awful singer?? I find it incredulous that Ken Hensley was on this album. He should have left the band years before this dreadful cd. The only reason why I'm rating it a one star because I actually like the song 'It Ain't Easy' or else I would have rated this cd a big fat zero. Buy Sea of Light or Accoustically Driven instead!! or buy Demon's & Wizards their best ever!
2,what the hell happened,I must be awful prejudice but this new singer needs work. I havefollowed heep for years and they have totally lost what they hadwith David Byron. The harmony's are not bad. The album overall isbad. I've been a musician 30 yrs and I think It's very hard toreplace great singers.
4,Graduate Level,I used it for a graduate class on assessment. Book was a very good supplement to the class.
5,ALMOST TOO GOOD! LOVELY CHOCOLATE AND LESS APETITE!,"I am trying a low carb, sugar free diet. I can handle most of it, but living without chocolate really kills me. I have been searching for a lowcarb, sugarfree chocolate but they all seem to taste like rubber. That is, until I found this WONDERFUL product. I didn't buy it for the Hoodia, to be honest...I just wanted chocolate treats without the carbs and the sugar. I was truly impressed with the flavor (almost too good to be true)but my greatest joy came when I read I HAD TO EAT THREE OF THEM A DAY!!!! And guess what? It has cut down my cravings and my overall apetite. I bought another 4 jars and planning to always have them home!!!!!"
3,"Tasted wonderful, but did not suppress my appetite.","So if your on Atkins, or a low carb diet, and want a beautiful, sinfully delicious candy treat, this is it. No chemical notes at all, tasted just like sugar, rich chocolate, and creamy caramel. If you want to feel less hungry, it didn't do it for me."
3,They do taste wonderful...,"...and they really do curb cravings-but they are gone fast! It took about 2 or 3 for them to be effective and there are only 24 pieces in the tub. Between me and the Mr., it lasted 4 days :) Still, they were good-if ordering in the summer, throw them in the fridge for a few hours before eating them if you don't want to get messy!"
4,so tasty,"Well, I have got to say that these did nothing to curb my appetite. The reason for the four stars is that they are a delicious low calorie treat. I absolutely love them. It's like eating a little candy bar and even if you eat two, you are only eating 60 calories. They are really so good. I carry a couple in my purse so that when I get a craving for chocolate, I can just pop one in my mouth. The caramel is chewy and it's not a bite that you eat in two seconds so even though they didn't really curb the appetite, they helped me stay away from the Snickers!!"
4,A Fairly Good Running Shoe,"I run for a Division 1 School, meaning that I clock in about 70-80 miles each week with the team. This was the shoe that I did a good amount of my training in, and I have to say that I was pleased. However, there were a few kinks; one, as they have worn, I have had to lace them tighter and tighter. Two, lacing them tighter resulted in soreness to the bridge of my foot. ... anyways, just thought that i would add my opinion... good shoe though. (and I am a narrow foot too)"
3,Not So Essential Nina Due To Lots Of Great Songs MIA,"Very, very far from a Nina career retrospective box set. Her classic My Baby Just Care's For Me is not even included! Stick to the more familar Essential collections from RCA/Verve/Tomato & the Coplix CD set."
2,"Very Bad save your money, a 13 year old game enthusiest.","I got this assuming i would be like the tony hawk2 game but this is nothing like it it has bad control and graphics, i thought this was supposed to be 3D but its just like the game boy color games, my advice to you is buy tony hawk 2 or 3 you'll have a lot more fun."
3,Not what you may expect,"When the GBA was released one of its launch titles was the excellent Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 which utilized the GBA's graphic horsepower to give it a real time 3-D feel. The recently released Tony Hawk 3 uses this as well, and when the GBA version of Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX was released, I expected it to be like the Tony Hawk games, and I was wrong. This game looks more 16 bit than 32 bit, the graphics are 2-D with a horizontal up-down slant allowing you to trick off ramps, but nothing else. However, this is not a bad game by any means, the control is superb, and there are enough gameplay options available to keep you busy for a while. All in all, not a bad game at all, but I only hope the upcoming GBA sequel will follow in the steps of its Tony Hawk cousins."
2,BORING!,"This game has no obstacles! It wears out your thumbs. You need a good memory to remember all the tricks.The few good things about it are, it has a training camp and it is long.Don't buy this game unless you have a good memory, have tough thumbs and you don't like obstacles."
1,this is very poor made,this is not a very good game it is very hard to control so i got it for 4 dollars so i guess that was worth it but dont bye it its a wast of moeny keep your moeny
1,YUCK!!,"I wrote a review praising this game before, but that was cuz I hadn't seen any screens shots of it...This game stinks...It has the graphics of a Game boy Color Game!!! The only improvement is that it has more color.I suggest that you buy Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2...It IS 3D just like Tony Hawks pro skater 2 for the GBA"
1,Poor Quality,I ordered this and had alredy bought a professional slicer to slice it. It was a joke when it came to taste and texture. Poor processing or poor recipe!! I would never buy their product again.
4,"GREAT, HARD, SHORT","I really liked this game. Well obviously because I luv SpongeBob. But besides that. The sound is kinda annoying, the graphics are awesome, and it's funny! It's pretty tough tho. I died ALOT! The 1st boss is hard, but the others are easy. Really weird too. The only problem is this game is too short, I mean, I beat it in 3 hours. But I like to play it again & again. Buy this as a intermiediate game. Kinda like ur 3rd or 4th. It's a game I guarentee you'll luv.SPONGEBOB 4EVER!!! B)"
2,"Too easy to beat, no replay value","I bought this for my 7 yr old son for his birthday along with the Gameboy Advance console. He beat this game in one week, that's not even playing everyday or for very long! He loves the character SpongeBob and in fact enjoyed playing the game but he complained that the game was too easy to beat and quickly got bored with it."
3,okay.....,"This game was fun but then I beat it in a few hours. It very easy, well for me it is. I think about [$] is alot for this game. There are 20 levels but each one takes about a few minutes I wouln't suggest anyone to buy it. If you really want to play it you should rent it."
4,good game,"I like the cartoon, and so does my brother. So I bought this game for him. It is pretty good, but not enough for 5 stars. A great game for kids as there are no violent themes in here."
3,My son loved it,"My 8-year old son got this game on Christmas Eve and by Dec. 26, he had finished the game. What is there is great, but the game is VERY short to say the least. He has played it several times, but for the price tag on it you kind of expect more. Pick up this one when it goes on clearence!"
2,spongebob square pants: Super Sponge by thq,this game doesn't have enough variety and is pretty boring.
4,Good Christian hip hop with appealing sound,"The hip hop mainstream is quite difficult to stomach right now. There's really nothing to get out of it. For a while there, I stopped listening to hip hop all together.Then I discovered Christain hip hop. Some is preachy, some is just straight up real talk. All of it has some sort of spiritual strengthening, and it's definitely nice to see that over pimping, hoes, cash, and enormous egos.The Body ends up being more on the preachy side, which to me is not a problem at all. To others, this may be an annoyance. Regardless, the tunes are usually quite catchy (although some are just okay), and the lyricists are talented in their own right.If you are into Christian rap, you should enjoy this CD."
5,Love this pot,"Husband bought me this for Christmas and the first one I recieved, the lid wobbled and did not sit right. I read over the booklet which stated that the lid was to be a 'tight' fitting lid. I called Amazon and true to form, they sent me another and I popped the defective one back in the mail. The second one was perfect. It looks small as its more upright than wide, but this little pot holds a bunch!"
4,Great Pot,"Great size pot. I was expecting it to be larger, but in reality it works really well for day-to-day needs."
3,Guaranteed,If this is in fact a LeCrueset it is guaranteed for life. Just return it to LeCrueset. I have done that numerous times. They are very responsive.PS Does anyone know if a steamer insert is available to fit this pot.
2,"Chipping, cracking, disappointing","I bought one of these Le Creuset stock pots about a year ago because I trusted the brand and I love their heavier enameled cast iron products. Unfortunately, in less than a month the enamel had cracked inside and out and has been chipping off ever since. Just to be clear, we never subjected it to rough treatment and only boiled things in it. It's been relegated to boiling jars for canning now because I don't want little bits of enamel in my food.This was NOT worth the nearly forty dollars I paid for it."
5,Sunshine pot,"I call this pot, my sunshine pot. Making food in it is a pure joy. It heats up super fast. Be aware that the bright yellow color will darken, the more you use it. I actually love it, but it does look dual tone now."
1,Chipped easily and had to throw it away warning!!!! NOT truly guaranteed!!!!!,Bought two of these. Both had the enamel chip off. One of them wore through to the inside of the pot and I had to toss it. When I contacted Le Creuset they said I could send it back at MY expense and they would EVALUATE if it was my error or theirs. Sounded like a losing proposition to me as the cost of sending it back is almost half the cost of another pot. BEWARE.... and listen to the reviewers who say it chipped. BOTH of mine did. I am very annoyed about it...especially the way that customer service handled my complaint. I was VERY nice about it and told them I own just about every other type of cookware they have including the big iron pot that costs over $300; bakeware etc. They didn't seem to care. Don't buy these.
2,Not the quality I expected,"The metal on this is so thin that nearly everything I cook in this burns and sticks to the bottom. Not only that, but even just using it to boil water takes forever because of the smaller base and taller size of the pot. I hate to give a bad review to something Le Creuset because I use their braiser and Dutch oven for 90% of my meals, but this was definitely not the quality I expected. I wish I had stopped ""giving it a chance"" before my return window closed!"
4,Good Book!,"This book deals with the combining arts with the internet. It focuses on how important the internet is as a medium for promotion of arts. While most other forms of promotion, advertising, or other publicity means are expensive, building a web presence is a cheap but VERY effective way to publicize yourself. And the best part is that you don't have to be famous or live in a major city to promote via inetrnet....people living in remote jungles even can do that. This book shows just what this whole business is about. It is a well written book, with an easy reading style and a understandable content Recommended if you're interested in arts, internet, or both."
2,"I Love Britney Spears...but not ""Rock 'N' Roll""","If you listen to the LIVE version off her Britney Spears ""Live in Las Vegas"" DVD that's a worthy cover of the Heart classic. But the studio version comes off too slow and boring if you ask me. It needs more pump, more energy, more attitude...all that lacks from this version. Britney Spears can sing, not with Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston (but she has a unique sound), but too much of the time I find myself going CMON!!"
5,THIS ROCKS--- DEFINATELY PURCHASE IT!!!!!,"Oh my god, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Three of the greatest songs off Britney's new multi-platinum album, ""Britney"", are on this single in really great remixes!!!!1. I love Rock 'n Roll - Great!2. I love Rock 'n Roll Karaoke - Awesome, I use it for my singing lessons!3. Overprotected Dark Child Remix - The best possible remix for this song4. I'm not a Girl, Not yet a Woman Remix - great, just the right remix!This CD is awesome and is totally worth the money..."
5,Cute tiny toy for anyone.,"I bought this to give to my brother as a present, he absolutely loves Jiji. This toy is very durable, and has lasted through alot of roughing around."
3,Not up to the mark,"I am have combination to Oily skin, and everyone suggested me Aloe for this brand since my skin is also allergy prone. However, for some reason I started having acne after constant use (2 months) for this cream. I will not buy it again."
4,Good soothing moisturizer,I love to use natural stuff for my skin and this item been very good choice.
2,Not for beginners,"I baught this DVD based on the name, thinking it was going to be geared towards beginners...not so!Although the movements are extreamly beatiful and the music in the background is very calming, unless you have a pair of video glasses it is very hard to follow these instructions.First of all, it might have been a good idea for them to shoot this video in a room that has mirrors. Being a former Martial Arts student, this is always a big help being able to see the techneque being tought from all angles.This DVD starts out with a great history and demonstraits how each movment is uses as a defense, it also shows you the full form from all angles. The problem is that because you have to move in a complete circle, it is hard to see the next move from behind.This definately takes practice, but I strongly recomend purchasing a pair of video glasses to avoid a crampted neck!Personally I found the DVD to be extreamly long."
1,Trouble Playing on My DVD Player,"I have a very good Blu-Ray DVD player that plays all sorts of DVDs. However, I found that I could not play this DVD on it.The only way I can play it is on my PC. Although the content provides a great deal of visual detail, the interface is poor. You have to figure out how to navigate and use the DVD, with no guidance from the material in it."
4,Works At Your Pace,"This is an great video for the practicing or aspiring martial artist who is interested in learning more about the history and benefits of Tai Chi. The DVD provides an ideal format for individual instruction, using short, well-labeled chapters that include each of the various postures presented at a comfortable, learnable pace. Master Liang is an exceptional teacher who provides perfect presentation of the 24 postures in appropriate detail, at a variety of angles, including specifice inhale/exhale points throughout the form. Of particular value is his solo presentation of each posture, followed by the self-defense presentation countering an attacker. For those who want more, also included is the longer 48 posture form. A must-have to complete your library!"
4,Great Beginner's Tai Chi DVD!,"Simplified Tai chi Chuan with Applications (YMAA)Impressive to watch Tai Chi Master, Shou-Yu Liang do the24 and 48 postures of Tai Chi. He's beauty in motion!Have attempted to learn through watching video's andthis is my third DVD. As wonderful as it is to watch,and as helpful as the angles are, I feel the need toexperience the moves with some additional guidance.I find that using the same titled book along withthis DVD has helped me connect the dots for getting fromone position to another correctly, and has assisted inmoving me along the path of learning and enjoying thesewonderful exercises and art. Never said I was graceful...but for those of you who might be able to tune into theirmovements in a mirror for feedback, it might be the perfectvideo for you. Breathing as suggested with each move... hashelped relax and energize me. I highly recommend this DVD.J.Rich"
4,Very pleased with my purchase,I love the different views & angles. It helped me a lot when I practice on my own. I totally recommend this video.
4,I needed this!,"I bought the book, but got in over my head, so I bought the DVD to try and understand the book better. If you all ready have the book and find it hard to understand, then you need to get the DVD. If you don't all ready have the book, but want to learn Tai Chi, then buy the DVD and if you want a reference to refer to then buy the book. I still think you should start by attending a class."
4,Very nice DVD,"This is a very nice DVD, but I am having trouble following the steps.I seem to do fine until the instructor turns around and then I get confused. Has anyone else had this problem? When you are facing the instructor do you mirror his movements or try to use the same leg and arm moevments he uses? Any help would be appreciated."
3,Tai chi Chuan,I have only viewed it once as I found it time consuming with the repeated steps. It was difficult to practice and also follow the form. Others I have talked to have rarely used it as well.
3,No Back View for 48 Postures,"I have the book and used it in conjunction with a video from another source to learn the 24 postures. When I wanted to learn a longer routine, this was an obvious choice. I saw this DVD had a ""back view"" of the 24 postures as well as a ""front view"", so I assumed it also had the back view of the 48 posture routine. It doesn't. Not only that, but it REPEATS the 48 posture routine from the front twice!! This duplication makes no sense when they could have used it for a different angle! My brain isn't wired to learn from the mirror image, so I am having a hard time with it. Once I kind of get it down, the ""matching"" book and video will be great, but they could have done it better."
5,thanks!,It is very hard for me to relax and tai chi helps me keep my mind clear of other things because i am concentrating on the movements. I would recommend this dvd for anyone who wants to learn tai chi. I have had many begining tai chi videos but this one takes the cake!
2,Bduh,"Well, I honestly exptected more from this DVD. I expected a pleasant background, explanation, music... anything! All you will see is a man practicing Tai-Chi about 4 times in an empty room. Two times facing the front, and two times facing the back. I liked the applications of Tai-Chi, but it kept referring to a book - which I don't have. I guess it was my fault for not getting more information about this product before buying it."
4,First Tai chi purchase,"I've just started looking into Tai chi, and think it may be the best exercise for me. I've reviewed the tape once and followed once, and find I am able to follow it quite well. Therefore, I've given it a good number of stars, and at this point would recommend it."
3,Tai Chi Cannot Be Simplified,Tai Chi is a difficult process to learn and I first started with an extremely slow and verbal lesson on another DVD. On this DVD no explanation of the the 24 steps is given when you practice the moves. He runs through the 24 moves two times in the forward position and then one time in the rear position. I've been doing these moves about 4-5 times a week for 5-6 weeks and have made slow progress. It would be best to start with a DVD like I did which was David Dorian-Ross.
4,"Good combination of History, Moves and Feeling","Although I don't think this DVD is for the absolute beginner, it does offer a good introduction to some of the history of TaiChi, as well as give very good examples of the 24 and 48 pasture forms. I found the rear view images hard to follow until I decided to watch them over and over several times without trying to follow along. This had the added benefit of helping me to 'feel' the movements more than just intellectualize them. I also found the martial applications very informative. This may be titled ""Simplified"" but it would be very valuable for the intermediate student as well."
4,Good basic applications to Simple Tai chi,Very good comprehensive applications that helps visualise them during the Tai chi 24 and 48 form practice.L MontpetitMartial artist for more than 25 years
3,Not too shabby,"THis one is pretty nice, but would be spectacular if Amazon included the book that goes with it. THe instruction is just him doing the moves, no explanation, no step by step. Includes several useful applications however, but the book would be great if you had it to follow along with."
2,Timbuk2 Ballistic Strap Pad,Well made but poorly desingned. There is no anti slip so the strap keeps sliding off your shoulder. Don't buy it!
2,Product was unreliable/Money back was not refunded,"I returned this product months ago, and I have yet to see my refund. Order at your own risk, the quality is rather misleading, for the product is basically hard, dry ice in a piece of nice cloth. Pretty unreliable, too bad I can't see my refund yet, even though it's been over 3 months."
3,the lesser of two evils,"Getting a bag in extra large bag in UK is a bit of a mission impossible. After finally ordering one from the EU It arrived with no shoulder strap. Any of the larger bags should have them as standard due to the extra weight to be carried.Used a padded shoulder strap from an old Nike messenger bag to see if it was worth the trouble and expense of getting a padded shoulder pad. Found the Nike shoulder pad done the trick.Located the non slip version in a local cycle shop, and purchased the non slip padded shoulder strap.The non slip does what it says, stays were it is with a bag loaded with 10-15 kg on a 11 mile trip. The down side is after 7 miles it starts hurt. My old Nike strap does not hurt, but slips every few miles.It boils down to the lesser of two evils, or pain. The pain of the padded strap or the pain of falling of my bike due to my bag slipping to the side at speed when taking a corner. So I guess its ok"
3,"Good soloists, mediocre chorus, mono recording","The soloists are very good, but the chorus (key in this opera) is not on the same level. ""Va Pensiero"", the famous chorus piece, is very weakly done. The mono recording is only just adequate, OK for the soloists but flat and dull for stage presence and orchestration."
5,stunning!,Absolutely beautiful and would definitely recommend.It beats paying for Waterford Crystal and noone would ever know unless they really look at it closely.
1,NO STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT,This perfume SMELLS so bad it cann't even be used on a dog. For years it was my favorite perfume but now very difficult to find in a store.....This is not the same. My family was very disappointed.........DO NOT PURCHASE.......I GAVE ONE STAR BECAUSE THE REVIEW WOULD GO THROGH WITHOUT ONE....BUT THIS SHOULD GET MINUS STARS.
4,Very good to continue with class,"i don't understand my teacher. So, this book is a big help. It teaches like a person is talking to you. However, i would like to see more practice questions where they actually shows the steps. There are many practice questions but they just provide the answers insted of showing the work."
2,Not the best book for review.,"This book was very difficult to follow. It contains both AB and BC sections, but does not specify which sections are which. It is difficult to see where they are headed much of the time, as if they are rambling with no direction. I found it to be very unhelpful and confusing. It was wordy and complicated. I often felt like the authors were trying to impress me with their knowledge when all I wanted was a clear, concise review! I recommend the Cliff Notes instead, which is about half the size and much easier to read and understand."
1,Unacceptable sound quality,"Evidently, the master from which copies were made is flawed. A humming/buzzing sound underlies all tracks on both the original copy I purchased and the replacement I was sent. Kudos to Amazon for, not only their prompt refund, but for sending me the postage I paid UPS despite my having discarded the postage receipts. However, be sure not to purchase this CD."
1,Wish I had read all the reviews,This is the worst sounding CD I have ever bought. Every song sounds like it came from a dirty record.
1,Poor Quality Sound,"Like a previous reviewer the CD I received also had very poor quality sound. It sounded like it was recorded straight from a much abused LP. I have well over 300 CD's and have never experienced such poor quality sound on a CD. I have old LP's which sound a lot better than this CD. I will return this CD and NOT order a replacement. ""Big Hits of the 50s"" - BAH HUMBUG!!"
2,Not so great!,"This collection is not for the conventional listener. It is more for the ""off-the-wall"" sort that may like silly stuff. It does have some nice songs mixed in with the crazy ""dragnet stuff"" but they get lost in the silliness."
5,Unexpected bonus,"What is not immediately evident from the song titles is that the old hoot'in and hollar'in song, ""Gramma's Lye Soap"" is a part of Johnny Standley's contribution to this collection. It is the second part of ""It's In The Book."" Brought back many memories."
1,Very bad quality,DO NOT BUY THIS CD! There is a very loud noise track in this CD. Great music that is trashed!!!
5,My Kid Loves It,"We would prefer that our child not watch TV, but when we started planning for a 5+ hour plane ride (each way) we decided we needed video help. We ordered this video and some construction videos. This is by far his favorite. He's 18 months old now and absolutely loves this video. When we do let him watch it, we watch it together. He loves pointing out the colors of the trains and seeing the guys driving or flags on the trains. We even enjoy watching it with him. The music and narration are good."
5,My toddler LOVES this DVD,"This DVD completely captivates my almost 2 1/2 year old. I was a little skeptical because it's a very simple DVD featuring footage of various trains in different locations interspersed with a few other things like work being done on tracks, etc., but my son loves it. He can watch it over & over again, & it holds his complete attention, unlike the handful of cartoon DVDs we let him watch. I only bought one, so will be buying the 2nd one, too. It's true that most of the trains are diesel, as a critical reviewer mentioned, but that doesn't matter to my son."
4,Review,I really liked the video and my 6 year old nephew loved it. The images on the video are crystal clear and colorful. The video features different types of trains and gives the kids some background information about each one. It contains background music along with a narrator. The only thing that I didn't like was that the video contains some images of trains with graffiti painted on them. The cars pass by really quick but you can still see the graffiti on them. I feel that this should have been edited out. Otherwise it's a great video about trains.
4,4 yr old son loves it!,"My son loves trains and he loves this video. No silly voices (parents thank you for that)Very educational, shows equipment and trains in a variety of settings, cheesy dated music but my son doesn't mind."
5,Great train video,"My 3-year old grandson is crazy about trains. We have watched this video over and over again, several time a day. Great train sounds. He loves it!! I would recommend this for under 5-years."
5,Real Trains is Real Fun!,"This has quickly become my son's favorite video. He's four years old, so he's begun to grow out of Thomas, but his passion for trains is chugging along strong. This movie is great, with narrations and explanations that really inspire him. It's even more exciting to him that we've ridden on the ""number 40"" (New Hope and Ivyland) that is featured.I like that there is an educational twist, it has added all sorts of words and concepts to my son's vocabulary.One complaint only. As a mom, though, the soundtrack music is a little repetitive and annoying, and it gets stuck in my head. Other than that, this movie is great!"
1,DVD- not received!,I purchased this item on 25 August 2010 but todate have not received the said item. It should have reached me by now but it has not- so I am unable to review or for that matter comment about it!! Would appreciate if someone can contact me and let me know whether the item has been sent and judging by the long period I would say that it has got lost in the post. Would it be possible to re-send this item (which was for my five year old who is crazy about trains!) to my US mail box!?? Your assistance will be appreciated.Thanks
4,Wireless TV in extra room,"Works as advertised, by allowing a TV to receive a signal without Cable or Antenna. Great for adding a TV on patio or garage where no cable outlet exists. Works with FIOS."
2,Quite working after 3 months,Product worked OK for 3 months then the receiver quite working. Not worth the money if it does not last any longer than this.
2,Interference kills the product,"Tried the Leapfrog with all variations of channels, positioning, antenna positioning, etc. I was working across a space of no more than twenty feet. There was no way to eliminate substantial interference, even including turning off my wi-fi hub, the most likely source. Simply could not get an acceptable picture, nor acceptable audio. I noted lots of reviews have described the same problem. Ultimately purchased the ""5.8 GHz Audio/Video Sender"", which strangely does not display a manufacturer's name, and it works great. See my review for that product; the product can be found on the margin of the main Leapfrog page."
2,Won't work with other 2.4 GHz devices,"Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution SystemI shut down every device attached to my wireless network, but that did not really reduce the obvious interference. I unplugged my 2.4 GHz wireless phone. That helped, because now all the 2.4 GHz devices in my home were off. Nonetheless, there remained some interference. I conclude that it must be coming from a neighbor's WiFi. Unless you have no 2.4 GHz devices yourself and live on a farm without neighbors, I cannot recommend this product."
5,Fantastic,"Works great right out of the box with easy setup. What neither the manual nor the info on line say is that the Leapfrog receiver has a built-in A/B switch. Plug in your cable box or antenna output to the Leapfrog receiver and when it is turned off, it passes the signal through to your TV. Turn on the Leapfrog and it feeds the Wi-Fi signal into your TV and turns off your antenna or cable box feed. Perfect! I had an earlier model from Recoton called the Rabbit whic got interference from neighbors' Wi-Fi computer systems and had a dinky range. This one is great without interference from my own in-house Wi-Fi."
3,It does the job,"This product does what it advertises, with the exception of the IR remote feature, which I couldn't get to work regardless of what I tried. Overall a decent product but improvements need to be made to the IR remote feature."
3,Dissapointed.,I was fairly disappointing in this product. The biggest problem was that it was not what I wanted. I was hoping for something that could take a coaxial in and transmit for a coaxial out to act as a coaxial cable. This device can only take rca in. The range is pretty awful. It won't work unless their facing each other and walls are a problem. When using the rca in you have to use the built in infrared jump. The price is kind of high too. The return was swift and easy. Amazon really does a great job on their return policy. I received a full refund.
4,Works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This saved me from crawling all over the attic to run wires.Picture is just as good as wired.
2,"Great Design, Poor Performance","i must say it looks great but didn't work as advertised. it says it'll work up to 150ft, line of sight. i installed it in straight line with no obstruction between the transmitter and receiver. video quality was ok with few interference, but audio quality was a killer. returned it and refund came through promptly."
3,Works Well Over Short Range,"I first tried to use it from one room to another only about 30 feet away, but picture and audio were sugject to dropout and interference no matter how the transmitter and receiver antennas were oriented. I ended up using the Terk model that works over the phone line rather than through the air transmission for this application and ended using this through the air unit only 15 feet away in the same room- where it works perfectly.It is too bad that Terk apparently has discontinued the phone line audio/video transmitter/receiver pair. This seemed like a better idea."
3,Not flawless but works.,"It can be a little struggle to aim the antennas just right when working across different floors/rooms, and it seems the ""perfect"" aiming makes all the difference as far as the image and sound quality goes.I was using it to transmit across floors and the image quality is good, but the sound seems to skip a lot (very annoying). The remote control extender's range might be shorter than the A/V transmition because even though I had a relatively clear image, it took multiple tries on the remote control to get it to control the main unit back in the other room.I haven't experienced any problems using this along with my wireless router."
3,worked great for eight months,"I brought one of these three years ago. It took a few minutes to set up and it worked great. After eight months I had wierd power issues with both the transmitter and the reciever. The red diode started to flicker and I would toggle the switch and at first that would help, but a couple months later, they were gone. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, or if they might have worked out some of the bugs."
2,Works great unless you have wireless internet!,"Our wireless internet causes this to sputter greatly if you use a laptop anywhere in the vicinity.Also, our Nintendo Wii has a built in wifi card. That means anytime the Wii is on, the TV in the greatroom using the LeapFrog can't be watched.Our microwave disrupts the signal.As an added bonus, cordless phones disrupt the signal.Basically... it's a good product if you can isolate it from other signals. It offers channel options, but they do not solve the problem.Buy with caution."
5,Wow!! Surprise-- this really works!!,We recently remodeled our kitchen and as part of the remodel we added an LCD TV. We have TiVO on our main TV and wanted to be able to watch taped shows in the kitchen without the hassle (and expense) of buying another TiVO box and subscription.We were skeptical about this product (especially the claim that the remote would work with it) -- but -- to our surprise (and delight) this thing really works!!Set up was a breeze and it works fine. Great product for the price!!
1,Leapfrog video sender not work for me,"Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution SystemI ordered this product in hopes of bringing TV to my sewing room. I ended up returning it (Thanks, Amazon, for making the returns process such a breeze!)Although the Leapfrog was two floors away, (within 3 minutes of plugging it in) it completely killed my wireless computer network. I worked on various channel settings, getting the frequencies as far apart as possible. Alas, there was no solution.The product itself worked wonderfully, and if I never wanted to use my home network again, I would have been very happy with it. Buyer beware -- but on the flip side, if you not have any other 2.4 GHz products this may just be for you."
2,Longevety is not part of this product,"I bought one. It worked great,...for quite a while. Don't know if it was a fluke that it stopped working, or if any one else had the same problem. I liked the concept, so I did purchase another brand."
4,Great when you have no cable wire,"Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution Systemworks as stated. I have a home just 5 years old and they (the builders) only wired the master bedroom with cable wire and not the other 3 bedrooms. I didn't want to run wire on the out side of the house, Leapfrog was the answer. Sometimes the picture is not the best but only for a few seconds, not a major problem."
3,Could Be Better,"It works OK, but the antennas broke the first day. Thay are half-way hanging there. Anyway, it is very convenient if you want to move a TV from room to room. I would buy this item again. Just wish the quality was a little better"
1,POPS AND CRACKS,"Pops and cracks for one room to another. I tried this product from one bed room to the other( on the same floor). Picture has static and the sound pops. The manual says that a cordless phone can cause this problem. So, if you don't have a cordless phone maybe it will work for you."
1,"Horrible device, poor quality signal","This never worked correctly, the signal always had static problems from my wireless phone and at it's best looked bad. A complete waste of money unless you are prepared to turn you house phone off to watch TV/Video/DVD."
3,60% satisfaction,"I purchased TERK LF-30 S wireless A/V transmitter and receiver systemto watch satellite programming in my bedroom from the satellite receiver in living room.Unfortunately,1.Remote control doesn't work as it should.I was forced to bye indepentent remote control system from Radiochack2. Strong interference from 4.9GHz home telephone system3. Unlike its Radiochack version, LF-30 S doesn't have S-cable connector."
5,Love this product,"I Love this product. It works perfectly. I have no problems with interference from other 2.4 mhz devices, even though there is a 2.4 mhz cordless phone in the same room. I have it hooked up to a stand alone dvr, through which I can receive satellite, DTV, a dvd player, as well as the programs on the dvr's hard drive. I am able to receive all these devices through Terk Leapfrog on a TV in a separate room. Don't know how the built in remote extender works, as I have a separate remote extender so that I can control all of my devices. Video quality and sound quality are very good. Pleased as heck with this device!"
4,it's ok,Unit provides good picture and sound for the money.Ability to use remote in viewing room is a major plus.Unit is subject to interference from electrical devices and vehicle ignition systems though. Bought one as a gift and liked it enough to buy a second one for me.
4,Works great until I use my wireless mouse or wireless keyboard.,"When we first installed the Leapfrog, in the back room, we didn't have the PC turned on, and the TV received great sound and picture from the front room via the Leapfrog. Soon after, ON went the PC, causing some TV static and picture problems. The KILLER was when either the wireless mouse, or wireless keyboard was touched. The static and picture distortion made it impossible to watch TV, via the Leapfrog. So...... for that TV, we'll just stay with watching local channels via our HD Indoor Antenna. We're keeping the Leapfrog because, it's kinda nice to have the option to watch Direct TV where ever we want, anyplace inside or outside of our home."
4,"Great technology, inventive product","I've used a ""wired"" Terk product of the same kind for many years to watch Tivo which is attached to one TV in a completely different room. It's a lot cheaper than buying two Tivos and the technology works great for standard TV (Not HD). This new product is being used with satellite to avoid an extra receiver lease. The wireless product works great, but you need to make sure you don't have a wireless network or phone on the same frequency (2.4 GHZ). This is the standard wireless network frequency. Also, you should keep the devices a little bit away from the actual TVs as they can cause interference as well."
1,Poor signal transmitter,"Bought this LF30STerk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution Systemto install a TV at the kitchen. All very easy to install, but the quality of the signal is poor, despite the receiver is installed only 22ft far from the transmitter, with no brick walls between them. I tried all channels, relative positions of antennas, and with and without wireless phone and internet router functioning. Nothing improved the quality of the image, full of ""ghosts"". Better to try an internal antenna if you want to watch only local channels. This device is not even close to what it says in its description."
1,terk disappointment,this system did not preform/work in the beginning. I informed the seller that I would continue to verify the operation and if they had any additional information to assist with operating functions on June 6 and to date have had no reply. as it stands this is my 1st and last purchase thru amazon.com
3,Might work for you,"Tried all four channels but got bars on all of them, even when I was only using these to get through 1 wall (~1 foot between the transmitter and receiver). I did not have the microwave on and wasn't using any of my phones. I didn't turn off my router but that explains only one channel. I suspect that if you live in an apartment building like I do that this device won't work for you. You simply can't turn off the phone of everyone in the building."
1,Does not work with wireless network,"This product worked great if I unplugged my wireless computer network. It did not work acceptably when the computer network was turned on, which happens to be all the time."
3,wireless technology *conflicts* with WiFi...,"*without* WiFi operating in same area, I was quite impressed with the quality of picture... *with* WiFi active, the TV display was quite chopped up... Sooooo, in order to use this method of sending a TV signal to the TV in my study, I have to shut down my WiFi wireless local area network *and* disable my notebook computer's WiFi connection (both create signals that interrupt the Leapfrog's 2.4 GHz signal). Needless to say, I don't use the study TV very often, and that was not the intent.... I should have returned the Leapfrog.Net, net, it is a fine technology *if* it does not have to compete with a WiFi network... J"
3,Only one little problem,"The California guy was close.. the IR extender does work, but it has such a short range and half-angle (pointing opposite from the wire), it is near useless for anyone wanting to control multiple devices. You have to put it right in front of the ONE device's IR window, and point it the right way. I'm trying to work with Terk to see what my other options are, else, I'll go run the AV cables and switch to a system that is only for remote controls"
3,"Audio thumbs up, video needs some work though.","I own a condo and the second bedroom doesn't have cable, so I bought this to run from a cable tuner into a monitor in the second bedroom. I go the audio to work great as most of the devices around my house are 2.4 GHz or higher, but the video doesn't keep up all the time and the screen will occassionally flash if an extreme color change occurs on the screen (popular transition with shows like CSI). So, I decided to convert it to transmitting PC audio from the computer desk in the same bedroom out to the living room stereo. It is working great for that purpose."
2,Terk and I are going back to the store,"I gave it a 2 because the setup was easy... However, it falls short because if you've got a cordless phone forget about it. popping noises and lines are so irritating I have to remove it and try to find something better."
4,"Works well, but subject to interference","The item works as promised. I have about 50 feet and at least 3 walls (on two separate stories) between the transmitter and receiver. Picture quality is mostly good (Standard Definition), and sound can be a bit tinny. IR works great. Microwave oven does create static. Oddly, so does my 5.8 Ghz cordless phone. No problems with wireless network running at 2.4 GHz. Much better than running cables!"
3,Effective but not spectacular,I use this product to transmit a signal from my camcorder to a receiver to broadcast a live signal to two projection sceens for the comedy shows I record. The signal quality is ok for what I need but it is not spectacular. I would question any use between walls or subfloor. My line of sight is clear but when someone walks between the transmitters you will get a little interference. Useful but not spectacular.
3,Questionable Range,"This is a great product for the price but it lacks range. I intalled in a room 1 floor apart. The actual space between the units is aprox 25 feet and the receptions is choppy making it virtually unusable. Picture dose not suffer as much as sound but with lack of sound consistency, picture quality doesn't matter. The claims for the range are unfounded."
2,Limited,"Video works OK, although I'm only using it over a short distance and not through walls. Audio occasionally has interference from some unknown source. The biggest issue I have is that the transmitter only has 1 input. So if you have more than 1 source (like a cable box and a DVD player), you're outta luck."
3,Works (with minor annoyance),"I have wireless internet and I don't have any issues with the product working properly. No static or interference found.An issue I notice is that when using the receiver and changing the channel or using the remote for volume, there is an annoying noise that happens when pressing the buttons. It's possible to avoid the noise by pressing mute before changing the channel or controlling volume, but that seems like an extra hassle.Also, changing the channel causes a bit of a delay sometimes and it doesn't always work as expected.If I find a similar product within the same price range, I'd be willing to try something else."
4,Take just a little time setting it up.,"I found that, yes, objectionable interference from other wireless items can be a problem. But with a little patient adjustment of your various components, all works flawlessly. One tip that worked for me on elimimating audio popping, turn way down the sound on the destination audio and turn up the sound from the origination audio to compensate. Problem solved."
1,Wireless anything & this don't coexist.,"If you are running anything cordless- Telephone, computer LAN etc. and you are going to opposite ends of the house and up/down stairs- SKIP this! Save yourself the time and find something else. You can adjust to your hearts' content- but nothing will fix the staticy sound and horrible picture.NO THANKS!"
2,2.4G interference,"Unwatchable with a 2.4G phone. Horizontal lines plus popping audio. I have a 802.11b 2.4G wireless network in the house which works fine with a 2.4G cordless phone, and also caused no interference with the Terk. The Terk and the phone however were unable to live together, so it's going to be headin gback to the shop..."
4,Music in other rooms.,Low price. Easy to set up. Good quality picture and audio. Still unable to get remote channel changing function to work.
1,Unfortunately a letdown,"I had my doubts about this from the other reviews,but thought I would try it. I hooked it up per the directions and all I got was static, I tried all the channels, shutting my phones and microwave and still nothing. The theory was good but the practice horrible. In the end I had to do what I was going to do in the beginning and run a wire 2 floors up and hard wire it. Works like a charm now."
1,Leapfrog LF-30,"I am an experienced ""audiofile"", but despite my best efforts with a 20' line of sight set-up, the performance was un-usable!! Run a wire if you possible can!"
1,Terk wireless audio/video link,"This product is not usable. While watching video or listening to audio, don't even think about turning on your microwave; the staic is unbearable. And it interferred with my RF TV remote to the point where I could not change channels. Product returned to vendor."
3,Potentially good product in the right home,"First off, I was impressed by what I got for the price. Two RWY cables, two transformers, the RX and TX box, and even an IR cable.Directions were good. The fully rotating antenna is invaluable.The downside was that I could never eliminate static. I tried all channels, I tried various positions, etc. I have a Wi Fi system in my apartment, so that could be a problem as mentioned many times.One thing I found interesting was that height is important. I would guess the units want to be at the same height as they are directional. Aiming antennas, changing channels, and getting the height correct was helpful, but not 100% succesful.Distance was within tolerance, and there's only sheetrock between them.Anyway, I could see this product working for some people, and that's great. I can't rate it higher due to my own experiences even though I like the price, the included extras, and the manual."
5,leapfrog is the best,"Easy to install, works flawlessly, no problems. A cost effective alternative to running cable to another room!!"
4,wireless transmitter,"Yahoo. Finally a product that I was actually able to 'plug in' and it worked as advertised. Thank you. 1 challenge, it did interfer with my wireless internet signal; the internet modem, cable receiver & wireless transmitter are all connected at the same location. Not sure of a solution except use either cable & transmitter or cable & internet, can't use all 3 at once."
4,met my expectations,This product works just fine. I use it in my kitchen so I have t turn it off when using the microwave but I already knew that from the other reviews prior to buyin it.
3,Not a bad product...but there are some things you should know:,"This product does what it says it does. It will 'beam' the signal from one device (in my case, a satellite box signal)to a TV in another room. It works GREAT, but some things to keep in mind. 1) If you have ANYTHING that runs off of a 2.4GHZ signal, such as a cordless phone, wireless mouse, a computer router, Wii controllers, or even a microwave, it can cause interference. I would recommend checking ALL of your wireless devices before buying this product to see that they are using. The biggest problem that I have is the microwave. The Wii remotes are also a problem, but I can't use the Wii and this product at the same time anyway due to how I have my system set up. So, please keep this in mind before buying. But please also keep in mind, it works as it should work, it just does not like 'sharing' its 2.4GHZ channel. It has 4 settings so if you play around with it a bit, hopefully you will find one that another device is not using."
3,150 Feet - I don't think so......,"Installation was easy. The picture quality is great. There is a very slight hiss in the sound, but barely noticeable. The receiver TV is in the kitchen, and it does not like the microwave. So, I need to mute if the TV and the microwave are running at the same time. The 150 feet is optimistic. My TV is 25 feet away from the transmitter, and it is okay. Any more than 50 feet and the signal is barely there. Also, the infrared extender does not work with DirectV. DirectV uses ultraviolet."
5,A must for wireless ease,Easy to follow instalation instructions. Was very pleased with performance of product. It was well worth the purchase. Go wireless with this quality product
4,Excellent Product,"This product works perfect, I was looking for something that allows to extend my cable signal to my kitchen and this was the only one that works."
4,LF-30 Wireless,"Good product, cheap, and efficient. It does what it was designed to do very well. Very easy installation and signal goes it way."
5,Works great,"I wanted a way to view satellite TV in my craft room without having to unhook the bedroom connection and use a loooooong coax cable. This unit works really well. Picture and sound are crisp and clear. I used the extra audio/video output of the satellite box for the transmitter. Used the coax output from the receiver to the craft room TV. I do have a wireless computer network and I don't notice any interference. I also have wireless phones, but they are on a 5.8GHz network."
1,Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless A/V Distrubution System,"The problem was a bad cable! Once I used a good cable, the system functioned as advertised! In fact I would give it at least a 4-star rating!----------------------------------------------------------It doesn't work at all! I intend to give it one more try!I couldn't submit my review until I rated the item. I thought zero stars was a proper value for a rating!"
1,Doesn't work if you have wireless anything!,We bought this system because we were moving furniture around our bedroom and thought it would be better than having a new cable outlet added. It set up really easy. There was some crackling and static on the screen. We read the troubleshooting tips and if you walk in front of the signal it goes black and it said to remove cordless phones. It wasn't too bad until we turned on our cordless phone to use it and the tv went nuts. Static and crackling. We have returned it because I can't imagine watching TV and never having the phone ring or not using the phone. Not worth the money or hassle!
4,May need to do some work,"It is good to see many positive reviews for this. Don't be discouraged if you buy this and don't get good results. You may have to do some work. First, you must follow the directions and ensure the correct sides of the antennas are pointed at each other. Next, you must ensure you have a clean channel selected from one of the four choices. I got the worst reception at channels A and D, but B and C came in clearly. Pay special attention to all 2.4 GHz transmitters you own, by seeing what channels they transmit on. I found the interference was not my wavelan, but my Logitech wireless joystick, so check the bands and frequencies of everything in your home that is on 2.4 GHz and choose a channel that is not in use. This product as adequate, but you may have to do some troubleshooting to get the best out of it."
5,"Great product, top notch signal","After reading all of the good ratings and the bad, I decided to give this product a chance. After I got it today, I am astounded at how well it works. The sound and picture going from one floor to another is amazing. At first the sound had popping, but once I moved the unit and adjusted the antenna, it was almost silent.Since it is a 2.4 GHZ device, I was worried that it would interfere with my wireless internet. On the C setting there was interference and the B setting completely cancelled my signal. But on the A setting there is no issue whatsoever.This is a great product that definitely deserves a try if you can't afford/don't want another satellite receiver."
1,Interference w/ 2.4GHz Telephone & Bad Customer Service,I tried to install at my house with only 20 feet range but I was getting static noise. Only way I could make it work was by disconnecting our 2.4GHz cordless telephone (Panasonic) unit. I tried to contact the customer service but nobody are answering the phone. I was on hold for 30 minutes twice and it was answered by a voice mailbox.
1,Junk! It wouldnt go 20 feet... OR 17 LINE OF SIGHT!,"I got this and was excited. I can get almost any product to work. I was thinking ""all of those other guys are wrong, I'll order this and it will work fine"" NOPE! I installed it, and there were lines across the video and the audio would cut in and out. I messed with it for another hour, turning off every other thing in the house (cordless phones included). Still, the same thing, and I was only going through 2 walls, a total of 20 feet. So, just for the heck of it I gave them line of sight. a 17 foot span, line of sight. Nothing blocking them, noting in the house turned on (I even unplugged my microwave like the instructions suggest). Still, the same issue with the video and the audio. Don't waste your time on this. I wanted to crush them, but I sent them back to Amazon instead."
2,Almost Works,"This product ""almost"" worked for me. Distance from TV room to bedroom was about 60 ft. Picture looked good, but with occasional jumps. That might have been OK, but the audio had sporadic pops and hisses from interference. Turned off all wireless routers and phones, but no effect. Some channels were better than others, but none was acceptable. Tried all kinds of alignment and positioning with both antennas, but no help. Ability to transmit remote control signal was very impressive, but in the end the audio interference made the system unusable."
4,Works great for the basics,We are using this to send audio/video from our AT&T Uverse box in the living room to a small LCD TV in our kitchen. Probably about 40-50 feet and several walls in between. The sound and video quality are remarkably good. The only interference issue we have had is when we run the microwave (which is only a few feet away from the Terk receiver). We currently have an 802.11b/g wireless LAN and a baby monitor running with it and neither of those seem to interfere at all. Very happy with the purchase - especially the price compared to more expensive systems.
2,Distance specifications are untrue,"Got about 25/30 feet from upstairs to downstairs, no plaster or obstrctions. IR works ok but carrier can be heard even when you receive audio video. Only use at home, if you are a contractor do not put in your design."
1,Could not get it to work,"I tried and tried to get this to work to no avail. I connected the transmitter to my DVR and the receiver to a second television. It seemed to be connected, but not picking up the picture. I was transmitting over a distance of 20 feet through one wall. The return with Amazon was very easy."
1,A waste of money,"Lots of interference and poor range. Don't buy it for the kitchen, the microwave will interfere with it. Signal can't travel less than 20 feet through one wall."
1,Does not work with Digital Cable,"I bought this item before my cable company (RCN) decided to go all Digital and require a converter box to receive channels. So when I connected this thing to the converter box, the signal was choppy and full of static.I would not recommend this product for the modern day audio/visual equipment."
3,Turk Tv signal transmitter,"This product works as well as I expected. It transmits video with as clear a picture as analog cable TV. To me, there is nothing wrong with that.I knew that microwaves and other devices on the same frequency would interrupt the signal. I guess I hadn't thought thoroughly about how frequently that would happen, living in a town home where other households are in such close proximity.When other neighbors are just beyond the wall, the program you are watching can be interrupted unexpectedly. When that happens there is no picture, no sound.We have enjoyed using it at times. At other times we have been very annoyed with the interruptions.It does what it claims to do. It is what it is."
2,"Works, but poor reception and must be aimed perfectly","This works to get a signal from our great room to my home office 40 feet away with a wall in between, but it is like watching analogue tv with poor reception. They have to be aimed just right and be pointing at each other and when someone walks between the two units, it can interfere with the signal. Great concept, but I won't use it often."
2,Works okay at under 10 ft away,Don't expect a good signal if you have to go through a wall or if it's more than a few feet away. Probably better to just break down and hard wire it (unless static doesn't bother you).
4,"Hooray, BOTH L'Arleseinne Suites AND a symphony!","It's quite difficult to get the L'Arlesienne suites in their entirety - too often the first Suite gets tucked onto the end of something else (e.g. Carmen) as a 'space-filler"". Neville Marriner gives a vibrant perfomance of both suites, which delighted my husband, who has wanted them for some time (I enjoyed them, too!)."
5,Just Dandy,"An orchestra such as the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields under Marriner ought to know just how to play Bizet's beautiful pieces with a light, brisk touch. You should expect to hear everything the music is about. You do.The Symphony in C and the Suites are played at terrific tempos, and the orchestra is restrained just enough to keep the tension. I very much appreciate the way the brass are herded back in during the finale of the second L'Arlesienne Suite. As the two themes are juxtaposed, the Horns are allowed to bellow the second phrase of the main theme, which is just what I want to hear. I also recommend it to your ears."
5,Great Album,Very nice Bizet - definitely recommend it to those who like classical music. Also good for the classical novice.
2,different? not much,Madden 2002 was not much different then 2001. They have new rosters and better faces but you can't realize that the faces are better.(what are you going to do instant replay it evertime.)My opinion keep 2001 and hope there will be an improvement in 2003.
3,great graphics but passing is hard,"This game is great and all but I have found that it is almost impossible to complete any passes. I have now played in over nine games and haven't scored a single point, plus it seems like the computer is impossible to beat no matter what difficulty it is."
2,madden 2002,IT [STUNK]! its just that simple. Its not worth buying your better off getting madden 2001. Its cheaper and in my opinion its way better.
5,Excellent!!,"The greatest sports gaming franchise on earth has done it again...how do they manage to improve every year!! One question, are they going to make an NCAA Football 2002 to go along with this game? I like building the college players up, then drafting them to see how they do in the pros."
1,Pathetic Game,"I do not Recomend this game. First of all, if you do things to quickly, the game crashes. The graphics are O.K., but the computer [isn't ]. Unless you want to control your player, they are a long way from the ball. Also, occasionally, the quarterback tends to throw to a reciver the computer picks. On defence, the pass defence [isn't good]. You cannot intercept easy-to-catch passes. And, the man to man coverage is horrible. Personally, I don't recomend this game."
4,franchise mode,i feel that if you can build a team completely through a draft ten this game would be great. in madden 2001 you can play franchise and i think that makes the game fun. if easports can do that for triple play and nhl and nba they would have most everybodys full attention
5,Madden Rules (Again!),"I have played all of the Maddens since its conception on the Sega Genesis. Madden 2002 is the creme of the crop. Finally, the AI is a worthy opponent for the single player and the multiplayer is top notch. Make your own team down to the color of the socks in Create-a-team mode or build a dynasty in franchise mode. I have had this game since its release date and have played about 75 games. There is still so much new to learn. Buy it! NOW!"
5,Madden just gets better and better.,"I'll admit, I was skeptical about how in the world they could improve on a game like 2001. That was the best video game I had ever played, but then I got my hands on this one. The football is so much more real, the movements are much less robotic than 2001, you can't beat the computer with the same plays over and over and over again, I mean this is a true strategy based football game, and that is just playing a single game. One thing that I do think should be added is the ability to create your own plays, and I think that whoever rated the ability of the players was a bit harsh on some people, especially the rookies, but hey, that's life, they have to earn it. Overall, the best game I've played, and the best football game ever...or at least till they come out with 2003."
3,"Ooh, HARD!","I like almost everything on this game exept that it's H-A-R-D hard. Also, interceptions? 1 per 1000 games! I even had it to the lowest difficulty, and I can't intercept. One more thing. The offensive line.........................is weak. Almost every time I'm on offense, the defense gets by, which is especially bad on runs and causes sacks. Three, because of everything else."
5,Arguably the best football game of the year baby!!!!!!!,"(by the way, i am 13. anyway...)This i think is the best football game of the year folks- MADDEN 2002. I played 2001, it was OK, Then i played 2002, COULDNT GET MY HANDS OFF THE CONTROL. But seriously, the franchise is pretty much the same, but more better free agents, better picks to get in the draft, and the graphics will BLOW you away. Unfourtanely like some other people, i would actually have to give this about 4 2/3. The reason for the one third is because the passing game can be very tough at times. And the computer is good on pretty much every level, EXCEPT Rookie. I also love the training/practice mode. And the NEW HOUSTON TEXANS INCLUDED. THE GAME SPECIALIST. IF ITS IN THE GAME, ITS IN THE GAME, SO JUST BUY THE GAME!"
5,Madden 2001 ROCKS!!,"By far the best football game I have ever played. Although Tecmo Bowl for Nintendo is still my all time favorite. I must be sentimental. Great graphics, great game play. I'll give it 5 stars even though Maddens voice gets on my nerves!"
5,Madden has got it going on for 2002!!,Just the pure feel of this game makes me want to play it all the time. I'm losing sleep over it. The most fun part is making your own uniforms in the create-a-team editor. The computer AL is hard though. Winning a game is not as easy as it used to be. Go out and buy this game!!
4,MIXED FEELINGS!,"First the good stuff! Graphics & Audio was SPECTACULAR! Much improved from the last one! There were times I actually thought I was watching a real game on ABC!What really disappointed me was the lack of plays to choose from. You really could not do much but run the same plays. I never found the QUARTERBACK SNEAK play, if there is one!"
3,Yeah.Right!!!,"Yeah,Yeah,Yeah.Its.Madden!!.So.What.This.is.the.worst.football.game.ive.seen.in.a.while!!Cuting.or.turning.direction.is.VERY.SLOW!!There.is.NO.WAY.to.run.up.the.middle.with.any.team.The.faces.looknothin.like.the.real.thing..........SAve.ur.money.or.get.NFl.2k2!"
1,Not that good,"I have had PS2 for a while, and i played this game a lot. I loved it. Then i got xbox, and NFL Fever is 10 times better. I just couldn't get over the graphics difference to start, the play selection screen is easier to navigate, and the game is much easier and fun to play."
5,a must buy!,"This is by far the best football game I've every played. I am completely fascinated with the franchise/dynasty mode which is far better then any game on the market. Salaries, Free agents, draft players out of college, trades, etc...you name it. It is very realistic. I give it 5 stars! The graphics are also out of this world."
2,DONT BUY THIS,I am a big Madden fan but this game is just bad. Madden 2001 is ten times better. there are a couple new cool features on this game but other wise its horrible! The off season features are exactly the same and there are never any good players. the best player is overall rated 75. this game is just bad.
2,Too Difficult for the casual player,"If you are looking for a fun football game that is easy to pick up and not too complicated this is not the one. While the graphics are absolutely amazing and lifelike the gameplay is very difficult. The rookie level is too easy and the next level up is almost impossible to stay close let alone win. Defense is impossible and offense is next to it. I have been playing this game since it came out and still have not defeated the computer once on Pro level. Graphics are great and features are fun, but games are either too challenging or too easy."

5,NFL year round!!,"Am a football fanatic and i wait for the football season from the next day of SuperBowl. Well, for me NFL madden 2002 is the best available medicine. The graphics are mind-blowing, so is the play by play calling Madden-summerall. Let it be the different game modes(exibition, tournament, season, et al), the music, the touchdown antics, the refrees and the coaches on the sideline, i mean everything is so real. Its like u are watching a love Football game. And u are actually playing it. So now, this year, i aint deperately waiting for September. I have enough NFL till then."
4,"Very good, but if you have 2001 don't get...","I first heard about this game coming out a few months ago. I was so excited having played the heck out of 2001. I went to Toys R Us the day it came out and bought it. There are many extra games and subtle graphical differences, but I realized I haven't been playing it at all. It's been a month and I still have not finished a season yet...I have 1 game to go. So I would say that if you have 2001 don't get it and rent it first. It's fun, but just for a week or 2.. That is unless you are very hardcore"
4,Great game BUT there are gliches,"Great graphics cool AI (except when CPU goes into unstoppable mode)1)the biggest problem with the game is: AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICES WHEN YOU GET TACKLED OR RUN OUT OF BOUNDS THE CLOCK NEVER STOPS, once in a while the clock will stop the right way but almost all the time the clock keeps going when you step out of bounds. WHY?? is it that hard to get it right. Even when you get tackled and Madden or Pat says he was pushed out of bounds but the clock is still running???"
5,OH MY GOD!!!!!!,"IF YOU ARE A FOOTBALL FAN BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!This is absolutley stunning in evey way, the graphics are amazing the sound are realistic and the gameplay is out of this world. This games seems to milk the PS2 and use it well, everything about it is smooth. There are only 2 negative points as far as I can see 1) you can edit the players in a season so all attributes are 99.... far too tempting and 2)It makes all other sports games look rubbish. It can be summed up in 3 words....BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"
1,No Online Play?!??!??!,"WHAT NO ONLINE PLAY???? As an avid fan of football video games, I must admit that I will stick with the slightly inferior Sega NFL2K2 simply because I can play online with NFL2K2. Until EA develops online play for Madden, I will stick with the Sega NFL 2k? series, even with the Xbox. Online play is redefining the football video game genre...c'mon EA, get with it!"
5,Best Football Game Ever,"This game is the best i have played so far on any system or any genre. I just got the game 3 weeks ago and can not stop playing it. It has everything you need to 'get in the game'. It has a normal game, a franchise, a custom leagues the works. It has the best of all the previous Madden games put into one package. And then there's the new Madden cards which you collect when doing special tasks in a game or two minute drill or training modes. With these u can buy 'cheats' which boosts a players abilities, for a certain time. These are great and really easy to earn in the 2 minute drill mode. This is a great game and if u have ever played a Madden game before u must get this one."
5,Much improved,"I just bought the game last night...The game play is smoother, more animations, etc... than 2001. But the coolest part of the game in my opinion is the ability to import the players from a finished season of NCAA Football 2002. Instead of going through the franchise mode and drafting ""no name"" players, you can draft players that you've played in NCAA Football 2002. It takes the game to the next level."
5,My third InSinkErator,Just went through a kitchen remodel and a new garbage disposal was part of it. We have had 3 InSinkErators over the past 31 years and this is the first one larger than a 1/2 horse. This one is the best so far and I can recommend it to anyone. Hint about the installation since I am getting on in years the weight of this one was more than I could manage without my arms getting tired so I got my small car jack and it helped hold it up while I got everything aligned and then it slipped into the collar. So quiet you can hardly hear it running. Great product.
1,insinkerator evo excel 1 HP disposal,"this has to the loudest disposal ever and it said it was very quiet, not much that can be done now"
4,InSinkErator Excell,"Installation was easy, unit seems to be working great. It's quiet and does good job handling what we put down it."
1,InSinkErator Evolution Excel,I have bought InSinkErrator before but now it is junk. I had to buy a insert for $50 extra for it to work with a cast iron sink. I was willing to do that but that did not end my problems. The cover is a piece of junk that fills up with waste when you use the disposal. Furthermore to fill the sink when you want to you must turn the insert over and you have to keep moving it to get the exact spot where it will hold water. What a junk disposal the company now makes. It use to be good just four or five years ago. Do not buy it.
2,slow drainage,"I have owned several Insinkerator disposals and have been generally satisfied with all of them . The EXCEL model is very quiet but agonizingly slow to drain . When rinsing dishes ,the drainage is not fast enough to keep up and the sink fills with water and waste even with the disposer turned on .This did not happen with previous models . The new baffle design is supposed to be an improvement but I think it is a giant leap backwards .In a complaint directly to the manufacturer , they said there is no alternate baffle available .I don't know if the lesser models now have the same baffle , but if they do , I surely will not buy another Insinkerator ."
5,Best disposal I ever had,"This disposal is so far ahead of anything I've ever had before that I hardly know where to begin. Most disposals choke on a lot of things--banana peels, anything stringy, chicken bones--not this one. It does it all very smoothly and so quiet that you don't jump at the start of its powerful action. I cook with a lot of raw vegetables and this one is made for anyone serious about cooking from scratch. Love it!"
5,Excellent,"After reading all the reviews and comparing all brands, it finally came down to insinkerator and WasteKing. we finally decided to go with Insinkerator. It was easy to install and is very powerful and so much quieter than the builder grade that we had. The one at Lowes was a little cheaper than this but I am always worried that the companies make inferior versions for box stores. So we decided to go with this. Would highly recommend to anyone."
5,You really can't tell it's on!!,The builder-installed disposal bit the dust. This one was highly rated and on sale at Amazon. Wanted something powerful and quiet but am amazed at how quiet this is. One hears only the running water but the disposal is busily grinding everything up. Have thrown banana and avocado peels into it as well as coffee grounds and egg shells and nothing remained. I feed it ice cubes after something worrisome (the peels) and it continues to operate happily. Highly recommended.
5,InSinkerator Evolution Excel Review,"Received in 2 days after order - Excellent service. I needed to replace a 21 year old 1/2 HP Emerson Disposal. It didn't leak, didn't freeze up, but after 21 years, the bearings were shot making it extremely loud and shook the dishes off the countertop. So I guess it was time. BTW, InSinkerator is made by Emerson. This new unit was VERY easy to install. From opening the box, uninstalling the old unit, hooking up the new one and testing for leaks was less than an hour. I've had it in use for about 2 months now and it's incredibly powerful and incredibly quiet. My wife still thinks I did something wrong because it's hard to tell when it's running. Compared to lesser units, this one is a bit more pricy, but well worth it. Excellent product. I highly recommend it."
5,Essential reference,"The author does an excellent job of explaining sweater construction and fit for a wide variety of body types. She also discusses common sweater knitting pitfalls at length. This book is not only an essential reference for designing a sweater from scratch, but also for customizing and/or correcting other people's patterns."
3,too much elementary arithmetic and too few knitted fabric characteristics,"I actually expected a book with in-depth description of the drape of knitted fabric, comparison and datailed discussion of stitch pattern. All these are mentioned only VERY superficially, e.g. knitted fabric is forgiving, cables pull in.The author went too far into the arithmetic of sweater shaping (she even explained what is an even number...), she basically spans 2 pages worth of contents into 200 pages. Read a sample chapter on one of the sweater design and you'll get what I mean. If you find that kind of instruction useful you'll probably like this book.I'd definitely return it if shipping is not that expensive. I gave it 3 stars however as probably it's just that I'm not a targeted audience of this book."
3,My old band,"This is one of my old bands. It's weird seeing it on amazon.com, its weird seeing it in stores too lol. I never really grasp the idea of us being signed.I left the band shortly after this album. Due to other interest (mostly got tired of playing death metal)This sound is heavy texas style death metal. The music is ok, there were only a few songs i enjoyed playing and hearing.If your into underground, brutal, satanic death metal... then you might like this.If your wonder, I was the bass player - TJ aka LordT6"
4,Very funny really,"Joseph Heller has been compared to Mark Twain and rightfully so. Like Twain, Heller has a sharp sense of humor and can easily point out the foibles of mankind. If you are looking for a modern novel with well developed characters and a plot- look elswhere. If you think you know anything at all about Rembrandt or life in the 17th century, then try this one on for size.Heller's paints a picture of Rembrandt (and Aristotle) that makes them so human you can laugh out loud at them, and you will."
3,a rather arduous read...,"'Picture This' is nothing like the many enjoyable novels I've read by the author. This time Heller crafts blended quasi-historical fiction where we learn all about Rembrandt and his painting of Aristotle, who somehow comes alive and we learn all about Aristotle's (and Plato's and Socrates's) life as well. For the first hundred pages I found this set up to be clever and interesting. But then it all gets very repetitive and dull. Yeah, Rembrandt was a talented jerk who went bankrupt. Yeah, ancient Athens was a total mess also. I really didn't want to know about all of Rembrandt's misdeeds or about all the wars and the inept government of ancient Athens. True, the author explains all this with great passion and humor. But for me even Heller couldn't make this book work for me.Bottom line: Joseph Heller has written much, much better. Not recommended."
5,Makes Coffee taste better when using French Press,"Easy to use, makes a great cup of coffee. Owning one of these makes a trip to Starbucks unnecessary."
5,Great grinder for great coffee,"I purchased this a few months ago. I was concerned about purchasing a refurbished unit - but the price was too good to pass up. This one was purchased to replaced the blade grinder that finally gave up. I did a lot of research and reading of reviews before purchasing this unit. I was determined to purchase a burr grinder this time. It is an awesome grinder.Very easy to use: plug it in, fill it up with beans and grind away. Simple. The large dial on the front makes it easy to pick a suitable grind. I've never had it clog up, like I've read in some other reviews. And, it does its part to make a great cup of coffee. Completely different flavor because the beans are ground much more uniformly than the with the blade grinder.A great machine for a great price. Highly recommended."
3,Attractive Hole Punch but!,I like the appearance of this Hole Punch but have a problem with the alignment of the paper. It is not a smooth operation as with the older models! Would not repurchase!
3,Packaging Not As Shown,"I'm a big fan of Al Hirt, and the music on the albums in this box sets would rank 4 to 5 stars in itself. However, the whole appeal of this pricey box set is the cool wooden box it's supposed to come with. I bought it from Amazon intending to display it after ripping the CD's. Unfortunately, the set I ordered arrived in a cheap looking white plastic box - not the natural wood box shown in the Amazon image. And seeing how you can get the exact same CD's separately on Amazon for less, there's not much reason to get this (unless you really want it all in one big white plastic case with a photo pasted to the front).So for the music, 5 stars. For the deceptive packaging, 1 star."
5,Great game but for younger kids,My son got this game for his 6th birthday. He sat right down with it and solved it within a day. It is still keeping his attention. My daughter who is 3 is still playing with it when ever brother will let her.
4,Bob is the best,(...)WHy would you buy a gameboy for a three year old. Bob is the greatest show in the world. I watch it every chance i get. Pilchard is so cool in this game.
5,Dogs Favorite Ball!!!!,My German Shepherd loves to play ball and this is the ball he loves the most. He loves this over any tennis ball or any other ball we have tried! It is tuff so it isn't easy for him to tear up even though it is Latex.
5,Too good to review...,"NO Oasis record or single is remotely bad enough to worry about reviewing...There's nothing to review...it's all tops! All true followers of Oasis know what I mean...If you don't like 'em, you've got a major problem....MADFERIT!!"
5,AWESOME,"Great single... getting older is alright, but idlers dream is pretty different for noel and the lads. Different style than the usual verse bridge chorus, repeat. BUY IT or at least buy Heathen Chemistry when it comes out!!!"
2,Derivative Rock,"This could have been a nice song without the ""songwriter's"" touch. Nicely played though. Not worth it."
2,When will they learn,"Definitely Maybe is my favourite album of all time, the album of my youth. Unfortunately Oasis are tarnisihing my youth by releasing drivel after drivel. Oasis used to sing about things people could relate to - boredom, being poor etc - what do you sing about when your millionaire celebrities - Hindu Times? How sad - clearly they are not religious in anyway - but John Lennon was - I'm getting a bit sick of their Beetle's worship.I want to look back on my youth and Oasis with fondness - so please stop buying their records and maybe they will go away."
5,"ANOTHER KICK IN THE PANTS FOR MUSIC,,,","YES, OASIS HAS DONE IT AGAIN !! JUST LIKE THEY DID IN THE 90'S WHEN THEY GAVE MUSIC A KICK IN THE PANTS. THE LATEST SINGLE ""HINDU TIMES"" IS A ROCKER WHICH IS FULL OF CLEVER GUITAR LICKS AND KEY CHANGES BUT YET THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR IS STRONG AS WELL. HINDU TIMES IS LIKE A PLENTY KICK THAT HITS THE GOALKEEPER IN THE GUTS AND DRIVES HIM BACK INTO THE NET FOR A 1-NIL WIN!!LIAM'S VOICE IS AGING LIKE WINE:HIS SNARL HAS A BIGGER BITE YOU JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OFF !!!!!! IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SINGLE,,,GET IT!!!! I'M COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS HERE IN CANADA FOR JULY 1ST TO BUY ""HEATHEN CHEMISTRY."" I WAS TOO YOUNG DURING THE BEATLES HEYDAY BUT THESE GUYS ARE THE NEXT BEST THING!!! THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD!!!!!"
3,Finding their way from country to rock,"After leaving from Linda Ronstadt, they had to evolve from country to rock and this album helped in the journey of the 70's...like the rock more."
5,CD,Used CD's are the way to go. Good price and easy to get. Eagles are the best and with this CD I have all. This is one of the best.
4,Good (Country Rock) Eagles,"The Eagles, Desperado, 1973The definite standouts of this album are no doubt Tequila Sunrise and Desperado, which were actually written in the same week, but that is beyond the point. There is one other major standout though, and that is the opener, Doolin Dalton. It is a slower number that is amazing Country Rock in the league of Gram Parsons. There are also a couple fast and fun songs, like Twenty-One, but the ones that keep you listening are the deeper cuts, like Outlaw Man and the mandolin driven Saturday Night. So, if you like Gram Parsons or the Marshall Tucker Band, or just want to hear early Eagles, then this is definitely worth the purchase!"
4,One of the Eagles' best albums,"This is not a 5-star classic, but I don't think any of the Eagles' studio albums were. The Greatest Hits 71-75 album definitely is, though.But Desperado is a very good 4-star album. Even the lesser-known songs are great."
4,Desperado,"Very good early Eagles album. The songs ""Tequila Sunrise"" and ""Desperado"" helped make them superstars. Some of the other songs on this album were ""kinda iffy"". They are good but you won't find yourself singing them in the shower."
3,"Good Concept, Decent Songs","The Eagles Desperado is a concept album of the old west. Many intriguing tales about the untamed west and the many Desperados and Outlaws that roamed Out of Control through such untamed territories like Bitter Creek.Whereas the lyrics are somewhat interesting, musically the recordingis kind of hit nd miss. I like the opening track, Doolin' Dalton as there are some catchy hooks and some good vocals from Glenn Frey and Don Henley. Desperado is a pretty much heralded ballad and Out Of Control is a fierce rocker. Too bad I can barely make out the words that Glenn Frey is singing.There are a few minor drawbacks. Certain Kind Of Fool has an annoying vocal tone courtesy of Randy Meisner. Bitter Creek does drag a bit and somehow I would appreciate some more rock n roll numbers. The pace is a generally slow.Whereas I prefer On The Border, Hotel California, and One Of These Nights, this is overall a decent effort. I just would not say its quite prime time."
2,When you get past Desperado and Tequila sunrise this is a pretty poor album,"I can't for the life of me, understand that there's only one sub four star review on this crappy album. ""Desperado"" is one of my favorite EAGLES songs, but one great song doesn't an album make. I sold this to a used cd store a couple of years ago, and I can't say I miss it that much. I have the song ""Desperado"" recorded on cassette, and I have the ""Eagles Live"" on cd, so no problem. This is definitely the handsdown worst studio release in the EAGLES discography. ""On the border"" is only slightly better than this one. ""One of these nights"" is their final one with Bernie Leadon and is their best effort, so stick with that one instead of ""Desperado""."
5,Eagles are still flyin high after all these years,You can't go wrong with the Eagles as this album shows how they became one of the premier bands of all time.
5,Absolutely Classic,"This is, I believe, the strongest Eagles album start to finish. It has a consistent Western theme though the styles of the particular songs vary from hard rock (""Out Of Control"") to bluegrass (""Twenty-one"").Potential buyers who are first exploring the Eagles past their greatest hits albums should note, however, that there is a large stylistic difference between their first two albums and their later works such as ""Hotel California"". This is not necessarily a bad thing, but something you should be aware of.This would certainly be on my ""trapped on a desert island"" list of CDs."
1,Pounce Cat Treats,"Your price is ridiculous. You want $4.99 for a 2.1 oz pacage. Petco has them on sale for $1.79, and Wag.com, where I bought them because Petco didn't have the right flavor, has them for $1.99."
5,THE diagnostic ultrasound texbook,"The second edition updates an already definitive textbook of diagnostic ultrasound. The contributors are all luminaries in the field, many having authored their own texts. Dr. Rumack has been able to edit the book into a comprehensive yet readable text. The liberal addition of colored texts, tables and charts greatly enhances comprehension as well as facilitate quick review at the viewbox. It is well worth the price."
5,A Collectors Item,"I played h these dolls forever, and naturally when they returned I bought them for my daughter. I am rating this product on the older dolls, mainly cause for seven years * 2, I have bought my daughter a CPK for collection purposes. She loves them, and I buy the old vinatage ones for her to play with, the new ones are kept and stored. These dolls are adoable, come in every race you can imagine, are extremly durable, and are constantly getting a new update. I love their smell the most, but I did give it 3 stars for educational value because they all come with birth certificates and adoption papers. As with any child this will be a doll who will be their baby so naturally parenting will come into play as well. I love CPK and am a huge supporter of the long time maker."
3,what patch?,"got this for my grand-daughter last Christmas and it vanished shortly after-she play's with what she likes, and obviously she didn't like this one"
3,CAbbage patch Magic Glow,"Well, she glows in the dark, but my 4 year old grand daughter didn't realize in order for her to glow in the dark before she went to bed that she would have to hold her under the light for a period of time before she would glow in the dark. (Children want immediate results) When they do that it only lasts a real short time. On the other hand the stickers that also glow in the dark do not last long on the doll or clothes. Overall, she is a cabbage patch and how long will they really go around caring if she will glow in the dark, she is sure to be loved anyway."
1,uh,"I heard a few songs from don't wake me up and they rocked. After buying this cd I must say I feel sick to my stomach that I wasted money on this filth. There are no actual songs, just random sounds that infuriate me more every time i listen to them. I haven't heard all of their music from the other albums but if the rest is like this then I think they are destined to live in the slums of Olympia forever"
5,I love this anime!,I actually bought this anime without any review i just went on gut feeling and Success! This anime is amazing. A bit to much perverted but what do you expect lol. I love the angeloids mostly and it was shipped in a decent time but in great condition! So I am very pleased ttvm
5,More than ecchi to offer,"I was a bit skeptical of this particular Anime, even after watching the first episode online... but I have to say, I was NOT disappointing. The humor is constantly hitting you, and the whole way through is littered with ecchi scenes and fan-service, and that's what makes this series great. In all it was a great series and I can't wait for the second season to release.It's worth noting that if you're not familiar with the genre you should probably consider passing on this one, or at least check out an episode on the Funimation site.For those who will buy this awesome series; Laughter and even teary moments will accompany this ecchi filled series; You won't be disappointed."
4,"crass, lowbrow, ecchi - but very funny","If you are down on lowbrow anime pervert humor / ecchi comdey, regardless if there is some real cleverness & humor in it, then just walk away. This being another fantasy ecchi harem comedy, it has all of that & then some.But this show really had me laughing. And there is an intersting mystery going on with some darker ominous undertones, creating some legitimate tension making you want to see the next episode. The angeloid characters are all well done characters with distinct different personalities & motivations. Our mian protaganist who ends up having to look after the angeloids, is an idiot. But one of the better idiots I have seen in these kinds of comedys, and well done character. It could be easy to dismiss a show like this as more fan service cheeasiness, but I think it does have some genuinely funny stuff going on throughout most of the show. The end credit animation & songs being different for each episode (and quite funny & clever) add a nice touch."
5,a quickie anime review,"this is a funny anime, take sekirei,angels,cyborgs,and your standard pervy male lead charater mix and you have this funny anime. see if you can spot the female charater from gun sword. heh heh heh."
5,Soo happy I own this.,"Ever since I first saw this on Crunchyroll I thought it was hilarious. The panties flying away was the most hilarious thing I had ever seen at the time in anime. I was amazed at how this would quickly change from something hilarious, to serious emotional subjects, to awesome action sequences. I highly recommend this show."
2,Not my cup of tea....,"After reading several reviews about this product...I decided to give it a try....well I really didn't like it...to childish about everything....I understand that he's a boy going through puberty, but honestly it's the same thing over and over again....panty this panty that....and seriously with all the cursing...yeah they are in school blah blah....but hey if you like this show than awesome it just wasn't what I'm looking for in a show :)"
3,"Good, but be careful","I love the show so I bought the DVD. It shipped quicker than they said it would, but when I went to get the DVDs, the DVD box had a rip in it and the DVD cases had several of the prongs broken when I got them."
3,Incomplete,"The 13th episode ""Queen of the Sky"" is missing and also the 14th ""(OVA)-Project Pink"" not even mentioned.Before you by this video, you might want to consider this. It a shame it is not all here, it's depressing, because it a very good anime."
5,Love the art work!,"The packaging is great, the colores are great, Love the anime its cute, funny,touchy,and heart warming. I recommend it to true anime lovers!Came here in one peace and fast no problems with shipping.I will try and post up photos of the DVD so you can see what your getting."
3,ikraos,"To put this anime in a nut shell, basically, it's about an angeloid that falls from the sky and meets a young,perverted, disturbed teenage boy who becomes her master. There is some good laughs in this anime, it's pretty slow at first,but it picks up, it has a dark underlay tone to it, but otherwise it's a good watch."
3,Meh. Amusing but vacuous.,"I may or may not be the right person to review this as it's not really my cup of tea anyway, but it was very funny. Okay visually: Not striking but not cheesy either."
3,not a bad song,cool track adam levine sings the hook nicely hate kanye's attitude but at least he makes quality music.
3,Watch,"The watch was shipped late and it was not the same watch as in the photo. However, the watch that was sent was similiar and also very nice."
4,Eclectic Mix,"I agree with most everything the other reviewers have said here. I'm currently trying to get down Girl From Ipanema - a great little arrangement, although there are a couple of small errors in the tab. My only real complaint is some of the song selections are a bit strange for a book entitled ""The Very Best of..."" (Does anyone out there even want to hear Pomp and Circumstance, let alone hear it on a GUITAR???)The additional songs not listed by Amazon are: (Everything I Do)I Do It For You*The First Noel*In My Life*Jesu,Joy of Man's Desiring*Liberty Bell March*Longer*Romance*Tears In HeavenOne other comment: about half of these songs are arranged for Drop D tuning."
5,Why can't all Fingerstyle books be like this?,"I'm just getting started with fingerstyle, and I've been on a quest for a song book that encapsulates an ""essential"" repertoire of popular music. This book goes a long way in that direction. The songs are very familiar, they sound beautiful, the presentation is generally excellent, and the accompanying CD is CRITICAL for a very specific reason: learning any fingerstyle piece is challenging, so I need to be able to hear how it will sound when I master it BEFORE I decide to devote the next several weeks of my time to learning it. This is where most fingerstyle song books come up way short... you can't tell whether you're going to like the piece once you learn it because the song books almost never include a CD. For this reason alone, this book gets 5 stars from me, and the lovely collection of songs becomes icing on the cake."
4,I like the one piece that I have learned so far.,"I learned ""The Christmas Song"" (""Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire"")and it's a nice arrangement. It did take some work, but the tablature is also a great help. I had to figure out where to use barrés, myself, and it would have been a big help if they had indicated where barrés should be used. I like the choice of songs, and will try some of the other songs. I'm glad I bought the book, based on the one song I have learned."
4,"POIGNANT, HEARTWRENCHING HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAS WILD HORSES","Narrated by Bryan Brown, this story of Australias wild horses is touching and very beautifully done. It illustrates what happens when there are no controls, natural or otherwise over something as wild and beautiful as these horses.Really touches on the emotions of animal lovers and anyone for that matter.Also gives you a look at the diversity and uniqueness of the land and environment of Australia and their special problems.Very good video and very informative."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Taylor Cox Jr. and Ruby L. Beale offer readings, case studies and structured activities for developing individual and organizational diversity skills. The readings often focus on specific groups, but the underlying ideas can easily be extended to others. By focusing on the economic benefits of diversity management, the authors make a persuasive case that these ideas are strategically relevant, especially for companies that are trying to compete in the global economy. Some of the ideas are complex and take some real study, but they are presented clearly and concisely. The book offers little original research, but that is not the authors' goal. They mean to unite existing research and to put those ideas into action - a task that they perform very well. We at getAbstract recommend this book to human resource professionals, managers who must handle diverse workforces (especially executives who work outside their home country) and anyone struggling with diversity in the workplace."
4,PJ's are amazing.,Great depiction of the life of a PJ. Recommended to anybody with a military interest.
1,Not such a great book about great individuals,I found Hirsh's writing style choppy and at times the transitions between chapters and topics were confusing. Overall None Braver was a poor presentation of material that could have been informative and entertaining--which it was only slightly of both. I recommend you read something else on PJs. They deserve better.
4,Very clear with excellent production quality,"I enjoyed this video by an excellent technician and competitor -- Mike Swain. The filming and editing really makes it enjoyable to watch, and the explanations and demonstrations are clear and accurate. Anyone can learn new things from watching the techniques performed in this video."
3,Judo review of Mike Swain's JUDO,"I thought it was a very thorough review for the few techniques that it covered. However, I would have given it a much higher rating if it had covered more techniques, and had gone into some ground fighting techniques."
4,"well presented, well written","Having seen the negative review of this book, I feel obligated to post the following fact: I taught myself formal logic by reading this book all by myself when I was a teenager. It is clearly and precisely written. It is indeed true that the book's manner of explication assumes that the reader has a mathematically-inclined mind, but I consider that a good point."
4,My gateway to the origami world,"This was my first origami book. It flows from simple to intermediate to complex with no problem. The diagrams are the clearest there are (although I wished they ALL showed shading, only reason why I'm not giving five stars), and the models range from the cute (Penguin) to the original (Dog in a Doghouse) to the complex (Praying Mantis) to the REALLY complex (Crab). If you're a beginner, pick this book, and slowly evolve as you turn each page. Trust me, you'll thank me for it!"
5,This Book is Truly Excellent,"This Book is Very Neat Because Of The Cool Diagrams. This Book Is For Extremley Advanced Folders. I Have Made Only 7 Models. I Was Very Surprised On How Many Steps The Scorpion Was, But I Have Only Made 1 Scorpion. Making One Takes 2-4 Days For Me To Do! I Really Recomend This Book To People That Are Very Good At Folding, Not For People Who Just Like The Looks, Who Aren't Very Good."
3,paper craft,"This is harder than it looks. Patience is a requirement. My swan was all right, but I decided not to do any more. It just wasn't for me. Others may find it fun."
5,"A Review for ""Origami Zoo""",This book is great! It has good way of explaining complex origami models.
2,Poor design for marine applications,"It is clear that the engineering group that designed this antennae had little prior experience with marine installations. To begin with, antennae itself is much larger than it needs to be to do what it does. Secondly, the design requires the drilling of a one half inch diameter hole to allow the largest part of the connection to be made below the mounting surface. The alternative would have been to design it so that you could bring the smaller connector up through a three sixteenth to one quarter inch hole to make the connection in the body of the antennae. Generally speaking, in marine applications the larger the hole the greater the likelihood of a significant leak."
4,XM Radio,Worked perfectly for traveling from coast to coast. I also purchased a second antenna and used it in my boat.
1,connector and service problems,"The connector on the antenna I bought (from Amazon, quick delivery) FELL OFF the cable when I rerouted it after its first year. The people at Terk are generally hopeless. First they said they couldn't help it, they were made in China and they couldn't control quality. They wouldn't do anything about it either because the warranty period had expired. I'll buy another since they are the only game in town, but don't expect much. Quality is poor and service is worse.PK Connor, SV Havfruen."
3,"Good, Not Great","Liang Shou Yu is a good martial artist from the mainland and a very dedicated practitioner of the arts. His main expertise is Shuai Jiao (Chinese wrestling) which is evident in his Bagua. (Nothing wrong with that, it just shows what flavor he has.) There is a lot of information in this book and overall it deserves a higher score but the amount of information is actually the problem. Not enough in-depth information is given about the basic elements. It's nice to see the elk horn knives but to include a partner set in a book that also teaches basics for this complex system is like trying to please everyone at the same time. The conditioning exercises are mostly from Shuai Jiao and they are fine but it shows the attempt to cover everything. As a survey this is fine but there just is not enough strong instruction on the essentials of Bagua. This is a coulda: it ""coulda"" been a great book."
3,Good Movie / Low Quality DVD,"I'll not go into the pros and cons of the movie; if you're curious you can always rent it. But if you're thinking of buying it, the DVD looks as if it had been burned from the VHS tape. There's no sharpness; the colors are blurry.Also, the subtitles need some work. The only elements that are subtitled are the moments of dialog. This is confusing because if a character thinks to himself or says something off-screen, the lines are not subtitled. Also since one character is a writer, the camera will pick up lots of her writing which is supposed to tell you something about the person. But the written parts are not subtitled either. So the movie's intent and information are not complete when you watch this film."
2,"Muddled, but worth a rental","Do we really need to see reviews in this space in which the reviewers reveal the surprise ending of the film? Jeez.Anyway, the muddled sound quality is as bad as advertised here. Many times, subtitles appear with absolutely zero sound to be heard.The US VHS cover box also leads with this as a 'comedy.' Hardly. Unless you like your comedy extra, extra, extra black. There's absolutely nothing comedic about 302's history and the root cause of her pathological dislike of food. 301's tale is lighter, but it's no trip through the daisy field either."
3,Enter Sir Robert,"The mysterious Sir Robert finally appears in this Barcetshire novel by Angela Thirkell. Although not as good as some of Thirkell's earlier novels, it carries on the story and ties up some loose ends. Sir Robert's daughter, Edith, plays a big part in the book and adds life to a slow moving plot, however Thirkell fans will enjoy the book none the less."
5,70's Hits at a bargain price,"Let's just say, the TV show Swingtown has a great soundtrack and I was looking for something reasonably priced to fill my need for these tunes. Big Hits of the 70's did just that. 20 awesome hits from my favorite decade."
3,brings back old school days,o.k. mix of 70's music. i've heard better collaberations of music but i still recommend this on.
5,Outstanding,"These bags are tough and huge! They hold all my turning tools, hand planes and small electronic handhelds. They help to prevent rust build up and condensation. They are too expensive in my book but the quality is outstanding, so I guess I get why they are pricy. They are outstanding tool bags and even though I struggle with the price, i plan to buy another one"
2,"Okay, for what it is",This is a bare-bones case that isn't bad for the price. I put a Jornada 547 into it and it barely fit -- no room for any acessories. The main problem is the velcro fastener -- its way too small. I found it didnt hold my pocketPC well and ended up going out to a local store and finding a better quality case for $6.
5,This is where he started,This is a must cd for anyone who isa Mario Lanza fan. This is where hestarted.The music is wonderful.
1,A major disappointment,"Everything about this game looks fun and interesting. I, however, personally find it unplayayble. Too much happens too fast in too many areas, often out of sight or control. Without direct control from the player units behave ""stupidly"" and are annihilated. There is a line between realism and playability and this game has crossed it. I enjoy a challenge, but the ability to slow game action and much better AI for the units to function independently would minimally be required to make this game fun. IMHO fun is the point of playing games."
2,What a disappointment.,"Really - not one character in this story is worth the time it takes to read about them. The three sisters are weak willed, spoiled and completely selfish. The authority figures are stereotypical. The hero and his dog were the only two characters worth any mention, but when the hero settled for one of the two timing sisters, the author left me only the dog to cheer for."
2,Not so engaging a read.,"I just could not get into the book. I am used to a faster paced read, I guess. I could tell I was bored when I could not keep track of the characters!Teresa"
5,Love Stephanie Plum's writing,"I have just become a fan of mystery novels. Stephanie Plum has a gift for bringing her characters to life. When I read her books, I feel like I am in the moment. I love the humor which works its way into the story. After all, life has its humorous moments. I bonded quickly with the characters and couldn't wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. I am reading another of her books now... ""In Deep Voodoo"", and have also read ""Kill the Competition"". Each a great read. I highly recommend any of her books. Enjoy!"
3,Misleading Title,"I liked the book but the name was extremely misleading! It was a decent mystery but it was neither a romance novel nor was it particularly humourous. It was very much a murder mystery that focused on family drama and the complexities of sisterly relationships. There was also some gritty darkness to it; it was not a light, cupcakey read. There were love pairings dotting the landscape but definitely not central enough to name the entire book ""I Think I Love You"".The resolution to the mystery was anticlimatic given all the questions raised and the intensity of the investigation. Decent book overall and generally well written, but a poor title."
5,Fun read,Just a quick fun read. Likable characters and a good story. I'd like to read more about them! Worth the time.
4,Funny Story,I enjoyed reading this book. Cute and humerous. Quick and easy read. Highly recommend this book to all out there!
5,Lucky in love,"This book kept me wanting to never put it down. Very , very, very gooooood! I recommend anyone and everyone to read it."
4,Very Cute! Very Funny!,Enjoyable book about families. Very funny! Great Characters! So many situations were very true and realistic. Twists and turns in the story kept you guessing what would happen next. Very hard to put it down. Recommended.
3,Thoroughly enjoyed,"Quick, fun read. Centered around three sisters and the dynamics of family. Interesting to see how each individual ends up considering their upbringing."
4,I think I love you,Great book lost myself in it. Couldn't put the book down. This was more than just good reading it was great.
4,CUTE,Cute book but the characters were too many. Not able to build up a serious affinity for the main character.
4,humorous and fun,"This is a light hearted, funny book. Quick, fun read. I love all of the Stephanie Bond books! I would definitely recommend to those looking for a easy read with humor and romance."
5,Awesome Book,"This is the first book I have read by Stephanie Bond and I am so glad I have discovered her books. This book was just one of those books that I just couldn't put down. Great characters, great plots, twists and turns, just a great read. I can't wait to read more of Stephanie Bond's books. Light reading and moves along nicely. If you have never read a book by this author I would recommend you give this one a try. I think you will be hooked like I am!"
4,Easy read,Fun and easy to read Good book for lazy summer afternoons on the patio. A humorous love story with a touch of mystery.
4,More Romantic than Mystery,"I should have realized that having the word romantic in its title means that it has some sex, a little more than I would like in a mystery. However, this was just a small portion of the book so overall I enjoyed it."
3,Enjoyed this read,"This is a nice read, funny, danger, and romance all in one book. Thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to read."
3,I think I love you,Pretty good read the who done it had me stumped. Funny clever some parts a bit predictable. I give it a B
4,A tip for a Valentine's read - led to 3 titles and hours of enjoyment,"This book came to my attention from a Facebook page that recommends books each day. This was part of the ""Valentine's Day"" collection. I got the book and read a few pages, then went right back to the kindle store to find ALL the titles by this author. Her light and breezy style had me hooked.So - this is the logical 2nd read - with Kill the Competition tangentially related to this story. But, I read this one first. And was drawn to the author and into the story almost instantly. If you are looking for a simple and enjoyable read that doesn't disappoint in a large way, and is perfect for those stolen moments to relax - this is the author to grab a title from."
3,Enjoyable read,This was a cute story. I found it to be an enjoyable read. It was quick a nice book for relaxing on the weekend.
3,Good read,"Was a fun read, just wonder if maybe too much happens to one family? The characters are loving, yet I couldn't bond with either one of them. The twist that reveals the murderer is not as gripping as I was hoping for. But I did like my first Stephanie Bond mystery."
5,A must read,I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommended!!! Stephanie Bond is an amazing author and I can't get enough of her books!
5,I'm Liking Her Books.....,Started out a little slowly but after a few chapters I couldn't put it down. I will now look for another Stephanie Bond book to read. Enjoy..........you will.
3,Just one complaint,"This was a fun, light read that featured not one but TWO murder mysteries plus a healthy dose of innocent romance. This was my second Stephanie Bond book and overall, I like her style. Her books are perfect when you want to unwind, be entertained, and not have to think too hard. My one complaint about this book is that readers are introduced to a fairly large cast of characters and I, for one, had a hard time keeping everyone straight. The three sisters at the heart of the story, for example, were very unique characters but it took me about half the book begin to remember which name went with which character. I'm not sure how the author could have improved on that, though, because the large cast created more intrigue when it came to the whodunit side of the story."
3,I think I love you,"This is a delightful easy bedside reading book. The plot is mostly predictable after a few pages. There is s subtle humor which makes you want go further deep. The characters have so many multiple sex partners, that you think the institution of marriage is irrelevant for them."
4,Great read!,"I have been searching for a great read that was free (it WAS free when I bought it!) and this was it! Great story line, great twists, and a fabulous ending! Now, I want all of Stephanie Bond's books!"
4,Cute,This was a cute fun easy read. I am enjoying this author and will probably read more of her books.
3,I think I love you,Cute love story however it took to long to get to the plot for me. Not very quick paced but overall a really good story.
3,Lighthearted,This read is a wonderful example of mystery with humor. Enjoyed every wide. Can not wait to get another book by this author.
4,Great book!,"I think the subtitle, a humorous romantic mystery, is exactly right to describe this book. It was a quick, easy and thoroughly entertaining book! I would definitely recommend this to all you readers that like some ""junk food"" for the brain occasionally. It would be a great movie!"
5,I loved it,"I really enjoyed. Was funny, and full of action and I couldn't put it down.I can't wait to read more of her books"
4,I Think I Love You - Stephanie Bond,"This was a great murder mystery with lots of red herrings which kept me guessing. I enjoyed the interaction of the characters, especially the sisters. The bitchiness was very realistic! The descriptive passages were very well done – I felt I was there. A great read."
1,I think I love you...,I was not thrilled with reading this book...I am sorry I started reading it. I only read 3 chapters but was not to my liking
4,I think I love you,This took me a while to really get into but once you get the gist of the story it is a pleasant funny romantic mystery.
4,"Cute, fast read","Like Stephanie Bond's other books, this one is an easy fast read. Cute story with a surprise twist. Funny characters and dialogue."
4,I Think I Love You,"Not so unusual sister relationship. Who is the favorite, who gets by with most, still after leaving home an holding down important jobs. Then in comes a new man, an old boyfriend and hot shot and one that is always there but overlooked.A family with many differences, guilt's and a whole lot of love. A secret kept for many years.Murder, family differs and loves keep you guessing and wanting to know more.Shirley Ann"
3,easy reading,It was a good story easy to read and follow. Not overly complicated with a lot of different characters but enough to make it interesting. It led me to read a second book of her writing.
3,I want to like this book,"I wish I liked this book more, but at times, it's just too shallow and too silly. I did enjoy reading parts of it, but other parts just made me roll my eyes. It's just so mundane and ordinary so as to not be a good book, but at the same time so interesting that you really want it to get better. The whole romantic angle was almost gag-worthy in its clicheness, but the murder mystery part wasn't terrible though extremely predictable. It was insanely predictable to the point where you almost don't want to read it, but the characters and story are fun enough to keep you invested. You can shut your brain off and read this to enjoy it. It won't require much of your brain to follow."
3,I Think I Love You- STEPHANIE BOND,"I gave this book 3 stars. I like Stephanie Bond,this book isn't one of her best books. I have read a lot of her books and this one is not good as some that I have read.I think everyone who reads this review should read this book and judge for themselves.This review is only my opinion. If you like Stephanie Bond, I suggest you read this book."
2,Funny?,"It was a good book, I like mystery and wanted to know how it ended but it was not so romantic or funny. I think I laughed about twice. Very confused about the humorous romance references. I also felt that the characters were written as if they were teenagers rather than in their mid-late thirtys."
3,Fun fiction,"I enjoyed this book... listened to it via audiobook. Fun light fiction, totally predictable, but entertaining nonetheless."
3,Casual read,"I thought the plot was okay, though a little contrived. All in all, it was a decent diversion for me."
3,humorous....,"good read. like the sister story , very heartfelt , definitely definitely like the hunky guy mitchell -knight in shining armor feel to his character. made for a good light hearted snowed in day read"
5,awesome book,"I've gotten into the humorous mystery/suspense books. this one is my favorite so far. it has only a small bit of romance which fits the story well. this book kept me on my toes. I spent most of my weekend reading it just to finish. every time I thought I knew the answer the story got more intense & I couldn't wait to find out ""who done it"". definitely recommend!"
3,FORGETTABLE,"THIS BOOK WAS BORING. I COULD NOT GET INTO THE STORYLINE. THE PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE, THE CHARACTERS WERE CARDBOARD. DIDN'T EVEN READ THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS."
5,Makes you laugh and feel good,"Very funny book that keeps your curiosity up all the way to the end. Light-hearted read, with serious underlining family issues that are relatable to anyone who has experience with flawed family dynamics..."
4,Loved this book,"This was a great read, with lots of little plot twists. Though I did not have sisters, I had some friends who did. It's easy to imagine that sometimes the tension between sisters can be cruel. The mystery was well-written, with a great surprise at who was found to be the murderer. The sisters lived and worked in three different cities across the US, and it was interesting to see how they came back together in their small hometown. I liked the happy ending, too!"
3,Not my cup of tea...,"I love romance, historical romance, and even romantic mystery, but despite the title of this book, I didn't find it to be very humorous. There were some dark passages, dark themes, and more drama than comedy. I generally enjoy a more light-hearted book. Despite all that, I did push through and finish this book. I think it was pretty well spaced out and a quick read to boot."
5,I think I love you,I love Stephanie Bond and I love this book! It is a great read and very recommended to anyone who likes humorous mysteries!
4,A new author for me,"I've not read Stephanie Bond before, so this was a test case: will I like her? will this be worthy my time? Yes, it is light reading, but the characters are decently fleshed out and I wound up caring for them and hoping all would be well. What more could I ask for?"
1,just water this is fake,I bought another product from this brand and let me tell you its just water it has nothing in it. after buying this product and realizing that it was just water I googled it under KING BIO SCAM and what you know they were sued for fraud for false advertisment. do not waste you money...
5,An excellent scholarly treatise,"This book is written for other scholars, not for a general audience. The other reviewer is right that it is not an ""easy read,"" but it was not intended to be. As a scholarly treatise on Locke, it is an excellent work. In particular, the introductory chapter on Locke's political philosophy is simply one of the best brief introductions, which takes into account the context in which Locke wrote. In addition, the chapter on ""Governing Conduct,"" although it is oddly framed as a critique of Nietzsche and Foucault, is an excellent account of Locke's views on how humans are habituated into conduct and beliefs. I highly recommend this work for anyone doing advanced work on Locke. If you are beginner in early modern political philosophy, there are more accessible texts available."
3,Outdoor furniture cover,"While the product appeared to be well constructed, I found one small area where the seams did not meet. Other than this one small area the cover is heavy duty and the elastic drawstring edge should work well against the winter winds."
3,Will not protect cushions from getting wet,"I purchased this cover to hopefully protect my patio furniture cushions from getting soaked by rain. It worked well in the summer when there was only occasional rain. I would throw on the cover when rain was coming and take it off when the sun returned. My cushions remained pretty dry throughout the summer.However, winter has come in the Pacific Northwest along with the consistent rain and this cover has shown to be worthless in resisting water in this climate. My cushions have become completely waterlogged as if there was no cover at all.On the positive side, the build quality of this cover is good. The material is thick and heavy duty. It is a good cover to protect from leaves, dirt, bird poop, and the occasional rain. Just don't expect it to do a good job resisting water."
3,Didn't stand the test of time,"These are beautiful, well made furniture covers, but it doesn't look like they are designed for long term outdoor use. We bought a bunch for various chairs and outdoor tables, and the nylon exteriors and vinyl interiors looked like they would last. However, after about two years of sun and rain, the nylon surface is breaking down to a white powder and they are ripping where the high points of the furniture rest. The fabric is very brittle and can easily be torn by hand now.For year round use, you'll definitely have to hit it a few times a year with some armor all or something with a UV protectant."
3,Veranda cover water leak through during raining day,"I really like the material of this product. ( I bought BBQ cover first, and has great experience with iIt - 5 stars!!) But with this cover, every times it rains, I notice my patio table top is wet, a huge pool of water sitting on top. I wipe my table top dry, open nd flip cover to air dry to provide moisture build up (under the cover, i notice the reverse Side of cover is also completely wet) or possible mold growing after EACH raining day. I don't know why this occurs, perhaps there is material/sewing defect......"
5,Best cover i've had.,"This table set cover is very durable, waterproof and heavy. I've purchased other brands, and it is not only better priced, but looks like it will last for years longer. In fact, the only complaint I have is that it is so heavy, it was hard to use the drawstring tighteners at the bottom. I am very pleased with this item. It fit perfectly on my rectangle table with 6 chairs. I put a riser (box) in the middle of the table, underneath the cover, to make it drain off water without pooling."
4,great coverage,"This has protected my deck table and chairs (including cushions piled on the table) from several storms. It gets really windy up on my roof deck and the two clip on tie downs really hold it tight, as does the drawstring. Very happy with this product. I only give it four stars because I haven't had it through the winter. That will surely be the test!"
5,Quality Cover,"I bought this to protect my rectangular patio table and 6 chairs over the winter. I live in Wisconsin, so I won't know until spring how well the cover held up and protected the set as I need to store it outdoors. The cover itself was large enough for everything and it's very sturdy, quality and seems like it will hold up great. Looking forward to spring...oh yeah, bought mine at Walmart.com as it was cheaper over there. Sorry Amazon!"
4,Nice Quality,Just got it. It's got the right amount of heft. The material and workmanship are very good. So far we're very happy with it. It covers our outdoor table and six chairs very adequately keeping it all dry and clean from the morning dew.
3,"good quality, hard to secure","It's a good quality and attractive, but too difficult to cinch up at the bottom. We ended up using bungee cords to secure the cover to the furniture."
3,OK cover,"We live in an area where it is very windy. The first week that it was on the table, the tabs that are suppose to hold it down started to rip. I put something heavy on the cover to keep it from blowing away. I wish they would have put a couple more tie down straps on it than just two."
3,"Sturdy, but keeps blowing off","This is a good sized cover for my 60"" by 84"" table (seats 12). I can't fit the full sized chairs with the table under this cover, but I can fit those plastic type chairs. It seems heavyweight and sturdy. However, there is no tie and the bottom and as soon as a good wind comes along it blows right off. This is fixable by adding bungy cords or tying a rope around the bottom, but this obvious design flaw takes off a couple of stars."
4,Very Durable,"This is a replacement for another cover that lasted me only two years before it tore.While it has not yet experienced the extremes of a Northern Westchester Counter winter,which is the reason I only rated it at four stars, my initial impression is that the material is much stronger than the more costly cover I originally purchased.I have not experienced the problem others have reported related to the wind lifting the cover. Perhaps this is because my cover is a perfect fit over the table and chairs that it protects."
3,Great table cover but wrong fit,"Purchased this to obviously cover our patio set but even though we measure and it seemed the 108"" length would work it was a tight fit. The cover is more round than oval in shape so we had to upgrade to the XL size. Also there are only 2 straps to attach to the chair legs and oddly isn't enough to keep the cover down when it's extremely windy out. The straps do keep the cover from flying away since it's attached to the furniture (make sure it's heavy patio furniture).Overall the quality of the cover is very good, we have the same brand cover for our Weber Grill and have no complaints."
4,Quality Patio Cover,"I ordered this patio cover based on the numerous positive reviews on your site. I am very impressed with the weight and quality of this cover. Only complaint is the difficult in pulling the drawstring tight due to size and weight of the cover. However, this drawback does nothing to diminish my satifaction with the cover. Plan to buy more for my other unprotected patio table and chairs (4 more to go)."
3,"Good cover, not ideal for tall chairs","This cover is good quality and nice looking. Our patio table is rectangular, but the chair backs are higher and it does not cover the entire thing since the chairs are high (even with the 108"" length). But it will do the job in and Indiana winter."
3,Patio Table and Chair Set Cover,"This product is attractive and the fabric is very suitable for inclement weather. While it is supposed to adjust to varied lengths, I did not find the fit to be as described. It does have tabs to wrap around the legs of the furniture but it drags on the floor if your set is not the exact measured size. The adjustable pulls on the bottom only pull in the fabric a small amount. The cover coordinates with other pieces but the colors are slightly different and may have been from different production lots."
2,Not Durable,"I bought this cover exactly 28 months ago and it is now ripped and useless. While it seems very sturdy, it does not stand up to rain and wind very well. The material deteriorates and seems to get mildewy, then it starts to tear. I am going back to a cheaper cover made from car cover material that lasts just as long, but costs much less."
3,Purchased Jan. 2002,"I bought the whole set not just this table cover, 2 Bench, 2 BBQ, Ottoman, deck box, round fire pit, Umbrella, Chaise, and 6 Chair Covers through Amazon.These covers Looked Great and very High End the first year, but by the next spring the brown on the bottom had faded, and the fabric mildewed later the second year. The directions, say not to wash in the washer, so they look crummy, now but still work fairly well after 3 years, except where the chipmunks have chewed through them, and the cords have dry rotted. Husband tried power washing them, but it did not really help. (These were used year round in the upper Midwest.) I have disposed of 3 of the covers so far.I think I will go back to vinyl, as it is less expensive, and easier to keep clean."
2,Deterioates quickly..,"This cover only lasted two years. And what was worse was the underside decomposed and stuck to my granite table taking out some mortar from the table. It almost ruined my table. I would advise not getting this cover unless you have steel or glass tops and you do not get too much rain. Otherwise, look elsewhere. The warranty is short so that tells you something."
4,Good product for the price,This was pretty much as advertised. The only negative I have is that the draw string bottom is hard to pull since it is an elastic cord and is as big around as the cover. It's pretty much useless. There are some buckles with clips that can fasten around a chair leg on each end. I used the clips along with a couple bungee cords around the loops on the outside of the cover and fastened those to the legs as well. We had a big snow and live in a very windy area. The cover hasn't moved and is keeping our furniture dry!
5,Very nice and good for the money,"My husband had no trouble putting this cover on, which fit our large table and the chairs. It is sturdy, and even in the very heavy winds we've had lately, hasn't offered to budge at all."
5,Excellent cover!,"I just purchased a new patio dining set, wanted to protect it from the coming Montana winter and bought this cover based on the reviews. It is very well made of canvas like material with a waterproof coating and the drawstring cord really helps make it a snug fit. It is also attractive-the price is truly amazing for the quality of the product."
5,Patio Table Cover,"This patio table cover seems to be very well made and fits my table and six chairs perfectly. The length is just right, it goes to about six inches from the ground, which allows air circulation but offers plenty of protection from the elements."
4,Exactly what we wanted,"So far I've been very impressed with this cover. We haven't had it very long, so I can't attest to its durability, but at this point it has been great. The material is much heavier than I expected, and it fits very well over our rectangular table and six chairs (the chairs do not push in under the table). There are vents to help prevent mildew, two handles to help arrange the cover, two straps to clip around table or chair legs to hold it in place, and a drawstring around the bottom that can be tightened from either side. The only change I would request at this point is to the drawstring: it's a stretchy one and absolutely impossible to pull tight. I do like that the straps for anchoring it are clips and not velcro that would attract dirt and lint and they're not simple loops that require lifting the table or chair leg."
4,Great quality!,"This cover was exactly what I was looking for and I would recommend this product to anyone.Just needed to configure the table and chairs, so it wouldn't collect a pool of water on the top."
4,Great Patio Cover!!!,This is a great patio cover protecting your patio furniture from intense sun and mild to moderate rain (CA weather). I owned one before and it lasted more than 3 years. Good quality.
4,How to read the sizes,"The cover is very nice but I had to return it because of the size. Here is the information you need to know which was not in the listing. When it says ""for a table up to 88"" long"", that really means ""for a table plus the overhang for the chairs up to 88"" long"". In other words, don't measure your table. Put the chairs next to the table and measure the whole thing including chairs. My table is 65"" and this was not large enough.I exchanged this for the larger 108"" size and was fine."
1,Needs more than 2 tie-downs,"Material appears to be tough and durable. Size is as advertised and fits perfectly. The major dissapointment is that the cover has only 2 tie-downs - diagonally from each other at the corners. This is not enough. There should be at least 4, one at each corner. In a relatively light wind, the cover blew off entirely and dragged the two chairs to which it was attached across my patio. The manufacturer had a good product but decided to go cheap and only put two tie-downs on the cover. I will have to figure out a way to modify the cover myself so that it will be useable. Because of this significant flaw, I would not recommend this product."
2,Veranda Patio Table & Chair Cover 70932 Lasted 2 Seasons,"I expected this product to last more than two seasons. The product does not weather very well, the material breaks down causing linear cracks in the cover which results in moisture and mildew under the the cover. I purchased four Veranda chair covers at the same time and they are showing some deteration but are wearing far better than the table & chair covers."
3,Nice,Very large cover and very sturdy. It should have a better system to snug it up to the furniture but worth the money.
3,Good quality but I can't get it to stay on the table,"This cover is good quality, but I can't get it to stay on my tables. I have two tables pushed together with the cover over them. I used the clips and tied the bottom as tight as I could, but the cover keeps blowing off. How could it blow off with the clips? The table actually flipped over, and the cover blew off. The table never flipped over before the cover was on it. I live in Chicago where it is windy. I'm disappointed with the cover considering the price. Right now the cover is in the house, and the tables are on the patio exposed to the snow."
3,This is an OK cover...,"This is an OK cover. It really does not block all moisture from getting through it, and became discolored over the first summer we used it. Sort of expensive for the job is does...."
3,Reasonable product,It seems to do what is it made for. Size and fitting is not perfect though. Fast shipping and used the reviews to make the buy decision.
5,Great,This is very well constructed and is perfect for covering anything out on the patio and protecting it from the snow and bad weather. Seems like it will last well too.
4,Veranda Patio table and chair cover,"It is made out of a very durable material, good quality. The synch pull at the bottom is not so easy to synch tightly but it does have a strap with a clip to secure it to a chair leg. So far it has worked out for our needs."
4,patio table cover,"This is exactly as stated and shown; I just wish it would cover the legs of the chairs and table. That said, it is sturdy and durable."
2,Seems durable but difficult to fasten down.,The material appears to be strong and weather resistant but I could not tie or fixate it down . It is easily blown off the table and chairs by the wind. It also accumulates alot of rain water which is difficult to remove.
2,Attractive and well made but...,"I used this to cover a patio table and chairs on our deck. Unfortunately it was difficult to get the cover tight around the furniture. Pulling the string to snug the bottom of the cover was difficult. There are two hook and eye loops that I placed around table legs, but even with those a strong wind blew the cover off. I'm going to see if I can come up with a solution to better attach it to the patio furniture.Update 1/15/2013I mistakenly identified the straps as hook and eye. Instead they have click buckles similar to those found in a child's car seat.In order to eliminate having this cover blow off in a strong wind I tilted the chairs forward so that the front of the backs rested against the top of the table. Since my chairs are a spring sling design this allowed me to reduce the size of the bottom of the cover to an area smaller that the top. I also looped a rope through the handles of the cover to tighten it more than I could with the cover's elastic hem cord."
4,nice product,"Nice product that fits will, sturdy and good material. Draw strings at the bottom for a good fit with a solid feel"
4,Large size was too large,"Definitely there is the need of the size in inches for this kind of products. I purchased the large size as I didn't want to have the medium and then have to return it (as I'm outside the US), but it was too large."
3,"catches the wind, some mildew","Heavy duty. However, twice the wind has lifted the cover AND my heavy cast aluminum table, and tipped it over. It only has tie-downs on two of four legs. Better if it had tie-downs on all four legs so that the wind could not get under it as well, or if it had vents so that this patio furniture cover didn't act like a parasail.Also, after three months, it had mildewed."
2,Sandy took it off,I was not happy that it didn't tie down that well. It should have more click-close straps and hem cords to secure it. Sandy pulled it off leaving the chairs on their side and the table move about three feet from where it was. Not good for high winds. We have used a large tarp in the past and it stayed on!
1,Patio table & chair cover,"Did not receive the cover I ordered twice. Ordered an 88"" round cover and each time I received an 88"" long cover."
3,COVERED TABLE,The cover seems like it will be a good protectant for my furniture down at the Jersey Shore.
3,Expected more for the $$$,"Cover is thick and durable but it doesn't stay on my table very well when there is any wind. Covers my large rectangular table and six chairs, I just wish I wouldn't have to fix the cover every three days."
5,Excellent Cover,We are very pleased with this great sturdy attractive cover for our new patio furniture. It's quite substantial and maybe more than we need for California weather but it seems as though it will last for several seasons at least. The dimensions given are accurate and we were able to fit a long rectangular table and six chairs without a problem.
3,Not as large as needed,"The quality was great but the described dimensions were not accurate. So, it's not as large as I need it to be because I hv high back chairs. shipping & price were great"
3,Veranda Patio Table & chair cover,I like the material. Seems sturdy. I wish the cover came with a center drain that would help snow and water to flow out and not stay collected in the middle. I'm sure if any product has that built in.
5,Much bigger than I thought.,This is a very well made cover with more room than I needed which allowed me to cover more than I had planned. I am looking forward to a cover for the BBQ!
2,Looks nice but alarm doesn't work,"I would purchase this only for its pick-me-up lighting capability. The alarm has not gone off at all or at the wrong time. Fortunately the time is still accurate. Construction is so so, but it is compact and visually appealing."
4,except for the loud tick ...,"Clock is as described, works fine. Its principal asset seems to be its nice design (IMO there's a scarcity of good simple alarm clock designs despite the myriad choices).BUT for the borderline-problem issue of the CLICK every second.Personally I think there should not be a second hand. The second hand is not critical for the application, and it is the sole source of the noise."
2,Clock keeps stopping,"This is a nice looking clock, but the works is screwed up. Have tried 3 new batteries and the thing just won't run after a couple weeks, even though the light shows it has power, worked the first few days but died. Just another poor quality control item, made in Germany no longer means ""quality"" apparently."

5,A GREAT product...,"Arrived on time, well packed and just as described.One of the best purchases I've ever made!It's excellent quality and works perfectly.An easy purchase with a very good company.I hope to deal with them again."
2,Wall mirror.,The mirror was only six and half inches across which is too small for me. The mirror itself seemed distorted. The only good thing was the finish.
3,Book is only ONE of a BUNDLE.,"I purchased this book not realizing that it was part of a bundle of books that my child needed for school. Evidently, the book comes with a workbook, another smaller instructional book, and a couple of others. It MAY be worth it to purchase each book separately, but that would take a lot of time and it is a little chancey. I did not have the time to search for the other books, so I ended up buying the bundle-NEW. This is a rip-off from the schools and teachers, but that is another story. My purchase turned out to be the correct book, but I had to return it since it was not the complete bundle."
2,"Strategies for Successful Writing:A Rhetoric, research Guide and Reader","If the student had not desperately needed this book, we would have returned it. We did not realize we were buying a condensed version; therefore, the teacher has to make necessary copies for the student so he will have the information that the other students have. We were very disappointed."
5,GRACIAS SILVIO,"Realmente maravilloso, se deja escuchar de largo como lo era Al Final de este Viaje, puedes escuchar todo el repertorio y pensar que pasaron cinco minutos. Debe tener algo mágico de parte de ""El Aprendiz de Brujo"" pues mi hija de apenas dos años y medio goza con el disco y pide que lo toquen, especialmente, Totí. Simplemente MARAVILLOSO, ya no sorprende. Gracias Silvio."
2,naufrago,"Silvio Rodriguez no es Pavarotti, ni Luis Miguel. Su pequena voz combina mejor con una guitarra acustica que con un rabo de nube de violines.La portada es una cursillada que me recuerda al último vidioclip ""Dreamer"" de Ozzy Ozzborne. Que poeticos son los arlequines!"
5,"WOW, A genuine classic!",Boukman Eksperyan is an unreal talent and there is truely no other way to describe this group. The songs are hauntingly beautiful and the lyrics are applicable to real life. I can not wait for the next release from this original and creative group.
4,Good Product,"Works great in all my cams, (Canon SDIS, Nikon D40x, Panasonic lumix DMC-FX07 and Canon 860 IS) Should be faster, but for the price is ok.)"
5,why is the used copy $191????????????????,"edbbooks is obviously a crook, and a thief. Or they have absolutely no idea how to price the used books they sell. This book is available, brand new, from the stockman grass farmer bookshelf for under $40.00. Please go to thestockmangrassfarmer.com....you can order this book using the 1-800 #."
5,"vivid, imagistic poetry","These poems are stunning in their use of imagery. I particularly liked the poems from the series ""Objects for Still Lives."" Domina writes about both adult and childhood relationships and psyches extremely persuasively. The writing here is accessible yet rewards multiple rereadings."
5,A good mystery story,"You will be gripped with the suspense and intrigue from the mystery in the story. Leinil Francis Yu's artwork is spectacular as usual... and Warren Ellis' story is pretty darn good. Leinil F. Yu is one of the best Wolverine artists and his drawings truly shine in this saga. The story is not a typical Marvel Comics story -- it's much more grittier, adult, and has a bit of a bite. One thing I noticed was that the final product had some minor modifications to Warren Ellis' original script (probably due to editorial censorship?). All in all, a great read!"
2,Wolverine is still wolverine,"Wolverine has always been cast as a bad-tempered fellow. Ellis did not bring any new insight into his character. The plot is a little-bit hackneyed. An old killer known as White Ghost resurfaces to take revenge on Wolverine. The overly scientific explanation on how he survived the blast (based on a broken and too pliable bacokbone) is way too intellectual. Anyway the invertebrate survives and plays with Wolverine's mind using pre-planted sound blasters in the woods. Since Ellis is soo intellectual, these things have to be wired up, Why can't Wolverine simply follow these wires to his hideout??? No need to rely on smell trails etc.I see clear parallels in the Irish-speak dialogue as spoken by the White Ghost with Garth Ennis' Punisher story (Kitchen Irish) on dealing with the IRA. Someone is ripping material from another. Absolutely no originality here."
2,"ok toy, It didn't last long",It was a good learning experience. This little device does not have a speaker so I salvaged one from an old radio. Later I learned the necessity of mounting and protecting such a board when I broke it. The sound quality was minimum and something that a person would build on a breadboard for dis-assembly after proving to themselves they could make it. Make sure you look up soldering techniques. Cold solder joints look soldered when they are not. Youtube is your friend.
2,Voice Changer.. but if only you could hear it..,"The construction of this board is the only 'educational' value it offers. The parts are durable enough for casual work, assuming you have some basic soldering skills. A novice to such work can easily overheat and ruin some of the parts, so be careful. The unit itself seems sturdy, with strong connection and switches. The output is garbage! You can barely hear anything from the speaker, even at maximum volvume. It's a toy, and should be considered such when you go to purchase a voice changer module."
5,Excellent book! Excellent examples and sample code.,"Even the most complex topics are understandable. The book is targeted at programmers who have some experience in developing applications using .NET. Most of the content is not geared toward .NET beginners, but the introductions to each topic can be a good jump-start if you have previous application development experience. The book also provides a lot of advice to help determine when code generation is useful and when it is not.Anyone implementing code generation as part of their .NET application architecture should read this book at least once to assist with planning their strategy, and then refer back top specific topics during implementation. Overall it's a good buy because the author has taken a lot of time to ensure that the content is relevant to real-world developers, and there are several real-world application examples with source code included."
2,Mediocre,"Overall I'm disappointed with the book, there is nothing new here. The downloadable code is also poorly coded. If you have experience with code generation I'm not sure you'll find anything new in the book otherwise if you're just starting out with code generation then it might be a good starting point. I'll have to agree with the reviewer Mox Blu on this one."
1,Basilio,"Not so good. This book definitely deservs 3 stars as max. But those promoters gave 5, then I give 1. Just to be honest."
1,Smug,"Well having grown up in Oceania, I was quite interested to read the review to see what an outsider's perspective of the region was like.Unfortunately I found the good things about the book (his description of the places, and people he encountered), rather spoiled by the views presented by Mr Theroux.He seems to believe that having spent a short amount of time in a number of different countries gives him some great insight into the peoples that live there.I find Mr Theroux to be racist (particularly about the Japanese), smug, and extremely condescending. His book is full of little inaccuracies which those who read the book and don't know the region well are probably not aware of.It's easy I think to generalise about people based on a few examples that you encounter, but is it really useful or worthwhile?So read the book if you don't come from the region, but just don't believe everything he says..."
2,A Vanity Project,"What's next for the unflappable Paul Theroux? Will he buy a collapsible dirigible for a tour of Antarctica? Will he dis the residents of the South Pole writing profundities into his palm pilot from 1000 feet above??? One gets the feeling, reading this book, that if Paul were to ever really get himself into a particularly thorny situation, all he need do to save his carcass is pull out his platinum credit card. There's never a sense that Paul will ever put himself into any REAL danger; will ever endure true risk whilst on his many global travels & travails."
3,Slightly Tedious,"Like many of the other reviews here, I agree that the recent breakup of his marriage may have led the writer to come across as a complete grouch. However,it was still an honest account of his adventures. Having sailed a little in the Pacific, I can relate to some of the issues he has mentioned, such as the islanders' disregard for the preservation of their beaches and landscape. Most people want to believe that these islands are pristine. Beautiful and amazing as they are, there is a large amount of pollution;local beaches being used as the dump,toilet and bath. So,his depiction of this is at least accurate. His hatred for the Japanese is rather annoying,when the United States is equally as guilty for their conduct in military matters.... But,on the whole,the book was entertaining enough, perhaps because I have an interest in reading just about anything about the South Pacific."
4,Dyspeptic travelogue,"Theroux's bittersweet and even dyspeptic travelogue about the faded glories of Oceania and it's current sad state (if one credits everything he says) isn't going to entertain so much as depress you, but I found it fascinating nevertheless. His description of the formerly proud and warlike Marquesas Islanders, for example, who were never conquered, was especially poignant, describing them as getting fat from sitting around watching TV all day while eating bags of imported French cheese puffs. From what Theroux says, one gets the impression that much of French Polynesia subsists on care packages of junk food sent from France, since there's not a whole lot of work sailing outrigger canoes or conquering neighboring islands to be done anymore. Well, I would like to get another perspective on this but despite its overall downer theme I still found Theroux's comments interesting, and hopefully, things aren't as bad as he described."
4,Journey of one opinionated lonely guy,"Paul Theroux seems to despise most of Oceania except for his stay in Hawaii. Only thing he dislikes more than the Islands themselves are the bourgeois white people who inhabit the islands along with the natives. Mr. Theroux is particularly mean spirited to the Australians. Having never been there, I can presume most Aussies to be racist drunks from the book. Of course any travel book without strong opinions would be boring and Mr. Theroux is anything but. I thoroughly enjoy all of his books and I am currently reading the ""Pillars of Hercules"". (Guess what, he doesn't like Spain)"
2,Interesting although laces with anti-Japanese sentiment,"Not a bad read but I was disappointed by the author's tirades against the ""Nipponization"" of the Pacific. I'm sure the author does not use the term ""Nipponization"" in a affectionate manner."
4,Painful but hard to put down,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I found it somewhat unpleasant at first because Mr. Theroux seemed to be relating the trip to his personal problems. But that tapered off and the book becomes increasingly positive. He paints mildly unflattering pictures of the people he meets but is stoic about difficulties such as dangerous animals, terrain, and weather conditions. When describing life among the natives and natural surroundings, the pages fly by.I would not take what he writes as gospel (I do have some experience with one of the islands he visits) but in general his opinions feel insightful to me even if I don't necessarily agree with every detail. More importantly there were large sections of the book that were hard to put down and there were many times that I felt that I was there. All in all, I'm impressed by the journey and the intrepid Mr. Theroux."
2,Theroux has a poor impression of everything non-American,"I read all 500 pages of Theroux's 'Happy Isles of Oceania,' and even though I enjoyed some parts of it, many chapters left me wondering about what the heck is going on in this guy's head. He was very mean-spirited toward Australians for one, calling them racist drunks. There are no racists in America, right? Also, he continuosly criticized the French government for 'destroying' the cultures on the French Polynesian islands. Yes, some of it may be true, but what about the Americanization of Hawaii? I noticed Theroux had no complaints about Hawaii -- of which he discussed with the chapter heading 'Paradise' -- turning into a motorized society with natives working at McDonald's restaurants."
1,Paddling Theroux's Bias,"As an Australian and a good friend of several Pacific Islanders, I was quite offended by this book. Theroux makes sweeping generalizations about Australians, New Zealanders, and Pacific Islanders that are derogatory and border on racism. This book was written at a time when Theroux was very depressed, as he freely admits, and therefore has a great deal of negative bias. Although he does pick up a measure of optimism as he goes through the book, it is impossible to know how much of his discription can really be trusted. Slightly amusing, but not for those interested in what Oceania is really like!"
2,Theroux should've stayed home....,"Good grief, if I wanted a tale filled with hours of tooth-gnashing hatred and bitter invective I can just go to work. It's certainly not the sort of atmosphere I enjoy when reading a travelogue to try and escape my workaday existence.I understand that the South Pacific is not the ideal place, but it is depressing to read Theroux' constant struggle to express any sense of joy in his travels or the people he meets along the way.For an alternative, more light-hearted, still realistic take on the South Pacific with far less spleen, I highly recommend Tony Horowitz' ""Blue Latitudes""."
2,HEAVY DUTY ALUMINUM?,"I just got hold of this so called heavy duty aluminum burger press. It looks good but ""HEAVY DUTY ALUMINUM"" it's not even close. It's more like light weight pot metal. It feels like aluminum foil at best and might crumble if I hold it too tightly. The threads on the adjustable part of this thing are very rough. I haven't used it as yet but will give it a shot this evening. I give it 1 star because at least it looks like the picture and 1 star because I haven't used it yet. I'll be back!"
2,Wax paper required,"I'm disappointed with this press, not because it doesn't work but because it isn't ""non-stick."" A sheet of wax paper on top and bottom of the patty is absolutely needed to keep the meat from sticking to the press. Also, the gap around the adjustable top is large enough to extrude hamburger meat into the cavity at the top, leading to a major clean-up problem. My advice: always use wax paper when making patties."
1,"Junk, Junk and NOT SAFE","I used this one time and hand washed with only water and dish soap.I dried it right away. It didn't soak or harsh cleansers. The paint is not sealed with clear coat. It began to form bubbles of corrosion right away the next day (cast iron).The concept is good, and it works well, but you have to use wax paper between the metal. I used it twice, but I just can't use it anymore because of the risk of lead (made in china) with my kids.So I can't recommend this product at all, I just feel that it is generally unsafe to use."
2,Faster by hand.,"Always wanted a hamburger press. Searched until found this model. Very well built. Found hamburgers sticking to press. I also used non-stick sprays which worked, but got messy. Parchment paper did not work well. If you have a lot of time for making hamburgers and clean up with this press it will work. Using the old fashion method by hand is quicker and less messy."
4,Makes patty making a breeze,"Very pleased with this hamburger press. I used the Weston Patty Papers top and bottom, which makes removing and stacking the patties a breeze, as well as making for easier cleanup. The papers also make it easy to put the patties on the grill. I do agree with another reviewer that the patty size dial is hard to read, but I plan to leave it set at one-third of a pound, so not that big of a deal. I gather this needs to be hand-washed, so this and the hard-to-read markings knock off a star."
5,best burgers,Weston Non-Stick Single Hamburger Pressi hate frozin hamburgers this makes it easy to make your owni only paid 7.99 for it grate for bbq if you have to make 25 or 30 burgers just put 1 piece of wax paper on top and one at the botton the burgers pop rite out
1,Worthless,This is a very expensive hamburger press considering it just doesn't do it's job. The meat sticks to the top side of the press. The top side is 3x heavier than the bottom so it constantly falls over. Most of the time the hamburger falls apart when you open the unit to get the meat out. I will through this item in the garbage.
2,Works ok,"Works ok, have to partially mash hamburgers out to get them even, need to use wax paper to keep hamburger from being squashed into the upper part, have to disassemble to clean. Hate to say it but my Tupperware burger maker works better than this, if you need one of these be at my next yard sale."
2,Sturdy,This will make patties the thickness that you want in a short period of time. I would have liked too see a longer handle for compressing the patty. We used wax paper which worked just fine to prevent meat from sticking to press. It does have two holes in the rear base to secure unit to table top or butcher block.
2,Cheap,"I recieved one from from Amazon and the main screw post was too small for the hole and locking ring. Also, the coating was coming off. I went to return it to Amazon, but there were three references in the box asking me to contact the manufacture, so I did. They didn't answer the phone, but they did respond to my email request. They shipped me out a new one ASAP at no cost.I gave it 2 stars because I just don't like the product. I don't feel safe with it. The manufactures rep emailed me and told me the coating can be harmful if consumed, and it seems to come off so easily. I don't really want to have to wrap the thing in plastic wrap just to use it. Besides, what if that coating comes off on my hands? What if I injest it?Secondly, the metal screw has such a fine thread. It is BOUND to strip out.I wanted so much to own and enjoy this product with my new meat grinder, but I just can't see this lasting, so I am sending both items back."
2,More of a micro budget movie then low budget,"Nuthing much happened till about 30 minutes in (felt like college students with a hd video camera through the first act) ... after that is was ""ok"" from a hd video extreme low budget movie viewpoint. If you do get it ... don't give up till you get in 20 to 30 minutes (or just skip quickly through the first 20 minutes). Some ok ""college"" type actors are intermixed with decent secondary actors. Sound was ok."
1,Rip off!,"I was not happy with this movie, because the story line was aimed at shoot-em up action lovers. Good and Bad action, with soft bible suggestings."
1,Avoid the General Books edition,"I bought the 2009 General-Books.net edition, which unbeknownst to me was scanned, copied and printed by computers without humans checking the text. It is a shamefully error-filled book. Typos abound and entire paragraphs are frequently cut off. This book is in the public domain and can be read for free online, so a substandard printing is inexcusable, to say nothing of a printing with no standards at all.Here's a sentence from the first paragraph of the text:""It tells of his ekrly dreams and ideals, his efforts to know and to achieve, his revolt against the dreaniswathed dogmas in which people take refuge fromjTarsh. reality"""
2,It was ok,It just wasn't like all the rest of them.I found it very boring and long.I will still buy from this author but if another one is boring.I will prob move on to someone else.Some people in my book club thought it was ok tooSome liked it better then the others but like art.A good read is in the hands of the holder.
5,Wolves of the Dawn,My husband really enjoys this series of books. He hasn't read this one yet but he is sure he will enjoy it.
5,Everyone will benefit from this book.,"This book is an excellent tool for anyone seeking predictable color from their workflows and devices. It explains much about the human experience of seeing color and is candid about the shortcomings of the technology's attempts at adapting to the experience. It doesn't oversell or undersell the technology. It will be an excellent asset to any fellow color geeks, and a wake up call for anyone who expects color management to be like falling off a log.The technical detail is very sufficient to pull off a successful, color managed workflow!"
2,Already outdated?,"Published almost 4 years ago, this book is already pretty outdated.Good for the basic principles, but the things that were future concepts like multiple ink-sets and pigmented+dye inks couldn't be explained because they weren't really around yet.Technology moves so fast, it's hard to make books that keep up."
3,good book but due for update,"Very thorough and is written so that if necessary you can skip various parts if you feel you are getting too bogged down. This version was printed in 2005, not that long ago but technology changes a lot in that time, crt's are pretty much out the door and software and printers have evolved. Whilst the whole color management scenario has not really changed this book has vast sections for using software and devices which although still follow similar paths it would be nice to see it upgraded to fit in with todays products. Still all in all very thorough and worth the read."
4,Not for the faint at heart ... Very Technical,"This one will be on my reference shelf. It would be a text book for a course. I would say, the author knows his stuff and would be best read in a group and discuss each chapter with the group. Hay, I have had a lot of math, and physics so I can understand."
3,"Wayyy too long, wayy too heavy!","Don't get me wrong, if you want to have a masters degree in color management this might be your book, but ""for the rest of us"" I think it is simply too heavy (and I'm not talking about the weight here!).In my opinion books should be, above all, practical, they should help you get things done, and it takes too long before you finally get to that part in this book."
4,Best Candy around,"My husband and I both enjoy sugar free Nips. Smooth and creamy, a little extra chewy, so be careful of your fillings, but mmmm are they good. You can be happy with just one, because it takes a little time to devour it. We always have them in the house."
3,mystic bowlscd,Mystic BowlsI like this cd; howeverthe sounds of the bowls go too long between bings. I would like to hear more continuous sounds.
5,Exquisite Tones for the Soul,"I discovered this CD while searching for Tibetan sounds in the Album section of the Hearts of Space website [...]). Now I own the CD, and it is my current favorite.To say that it is relaxing, it is true, yet - - is not enough. And, yes, it is wonderful for meditation.It seems, to me, to be an invitation to go deeper within, and the earthy depths of sound that comes from the bowls satisfies that part of me that craves spiritual adventure. Temple Sounds has brought us something special, and is both simple and complex. I recommend it highly."
5,Great for the healing room!,"I have been playing this CD in the clinic for many years now, and its really a gem.The patients love it, and so do I, as it promotes relaxation, gentle breathing and acalm mind. As ambient music for a clinic, it is superb. For home use, contemplative,and meditation music, very wonderful, also. The resonance of the bowls feels healingas well as relaxing. It is one of my favorite healing CDs."
3,Just OK,"I guess I'm in the minority but this book just didn't strike me as all that special or unique. Yes, it is more interesting than Dick and Jane but that is not a very tough standard to measure against. My almost-[...] were not very interested in it.Also, if you are teaching your child phonics, be aware that there are many sight words that you will have to help them with in this book."
3,Mozart CD-A Mixed Performance,"This CD will bring varying levels of satisfaction to various listeners, depending upon their preference of tone quality. Erika Koth, singing Exsultate, Jubilate has beautiful floating high notes, however her tone, espically on lower notes, is very bright and her vowels are spread. I felt that Helen Donath, the soprano soloist for Requiem had a much nicer and fuller tone, neither too heavy nor too bright. The other soloists were good also, however the alto and bass are a bit heavy (which is not unusual). The choir(I have only listened to half of the Requiem so far) was pretty well balanced. Overall, this CD is a good buy."
4,How Mozart would have wanted it,"I must say, Giulini has done a great job keeping this piece light and lively in the style of the Classical period without losing it's deep and emotional flavor. Unlike some recordings of Mozart's monumental Requiem, which are normally too heavy and brooding, the Philharmonia has got the idea right. I'm sure Mozart would be pleased with this interpretation. As for the singers, Christa Ludwig is in top form as usual, Robert Lloyd is a great baritone, the tenor Robert Tear does a decent job, and Helen Donath is a sweet soprano. The price is a good bargain.My gripes are with the blatty trombone in Tuba Mirum, and Erika Koth's vibrato in Exultate Jubilate, which is too fast. Also, her voice is almost sickly sweet at times."
4,Requiem: Beautiful -- Exsultate: Eh.,"Two of Mozart's most impressive works in one recording. Especially for this price, it's a must-have. The requiem was performed beautifully. The interpretation was wonderful, the soloists were solid, the choir was clean, and the overall feel was beautiful. The Exsultate, however, was questionable. The soloist has ""shotgun"" vibrato, resulting in a lack of clarity especially in many of the quick melismatic passages. Additionally the sound is more light than I like, or than what I feel to be appropriate for a Mozart work, but that is something of a personal preference."
4,Great Selection of 80's Hits,"This CD contains a great selection of music from the 80s. Brings back fond memories of when I was in college. Glad they included songs from Billy Squire, Arcadia, Cutting Crew, and Steve Miller Band. I plan to purchase more like this from Amazon."
3,BIG HITS OF THE 80's,"This cd has alot of hard to find tracks i.e...ABRACADABRA and PROMISES, PROMISES. I really enjoyed this album."
3,Collecting dust in the corner while my cat scratches the chair,The product is exactly as represented but my cat could care less. I've tried putting him on there. I went and bought a different catnip just in case the other was stale. Nothing. Not even a smidgen of interest. I'm giving it away today.
4,my cat loooooves it,"i always buy cosmic scratcher and the replacements as well,. My cat is 10 years old and lovesss it , the replacements last about a month, great!"
5,Stopped carpet clawing in my multiple kitteh household,My cats used to claw away at the carpets in spite of a tall cat post. This seems to have replaced that problem. A little more time will tell as I'm watching for dig marks in any rug I have. The do love it. The one I think is the guilty party goes for it in a big way.
4,Too light but otherwise excellent,"The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it is basically useless for a large cat until you add ballast to keep it in place. I was lucky in finding a large scrap steel block that just fit inside. With this, my 15lb Russian Blue completely loved it and abandoned all furniture scratching with a few days of friendly encouragement. Considering it's so inexpensive, I would highly recommend this product if you can find some way to anchor it in place!"
4,Cat loves it!,"My big (15 lb) kitty loves this! The only problem is he is so big, and this is light, so he flips it over easily.I have to wedge it in-between two pieces of furniture to keep it in place. Would be perfect with some weight to it.."
5,The cats love it,"A friend had recommended this item, and so I purchased it. The cats love it and that's all that matters to me!"
4,Cats love it,"My kitties love this, both to scratch on and to play with -- and I never even sprinkled the catnip on it. When my kitten was really little, he would actually climb instead it to play with the toy. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the toy that dangles inside broke off the string pretty quickly."
5,"My cat likes it, so I like it too!!","This is not a fake review, so don't be alarmed. I just received this today, and I like it very much. I only have one cat and once she saw this, she liked it. Didn't take her long to begin scratching on it, which is what I enjoy the most. I got this because I couldn't afford to let a cat keep clawing at the wall since I live in an apartment. Even though the damage she did is minor, having a scratcher pad for my cat is a necessity and I'm glad I spent my money on this. Nice product. Thanks to the great folks at Amazon!!!! Everything was shipped nicely and the shipping was really quick."
2,Not original music,Some of the tracks are not the originals you heard on the movie. Seems like someone gave the score to a different orchestra and asked them to play it. Though its not bad it's not the real thing and I was disappointed. I'm so glad I got it for $5 rather than paying the full $30.
1,Order was cancelled and I was given a refund.,Never got the book. My order was cancelled and I was given a refund.
2,"Does the Job, but can be a hassle","We bought the Royal Crosscut shredder because we felt we needed the extra security of the crosscut. It does do a good job of destroying the sheets fed into it. However, after using the shredder a few months with little actual use, it stopped shutting off automatically. Upon checking the ""chewers"", I found paper stuck to the rollers that do the cutting. I found one piece stuck in what must be the shuttoff switch, and after some work was able to removed the stuck piece. After a few more sheets, it again stopped shutting off. I don't see any paper stuck this time.I would suggest looking for a different crosscut cutter if I were in the market."
3,Royal VF800 Confetti Paper Shredder Vertical Feed,I had trouble with 2 diferent ones shipping back was a pain and up to a long wait
5,Great Value!! Highly recommended,Don't waste your money purchasing individual packages of flash cards. This set covers all arithmatic along with time and money in convenient package. This is a great product to have even if your children aren't necessarily struggling with math. It's a great way to maintain a solid arithmatic foundation.
1,Save some money and go with the 1984 Edition,"I gave this book a 2 star because I feel they are trying to trick people into beliveing it is different book from the 1984 version.I feel like the authors ripped us off when we bought this book. Basically it is the same as the 1984 edition, except they threw in some grasses and sedges. To help sell the book they changed the front cover to look different from the 19997 version, but all the wording and photos are the same. This threw us off as we purchased the book thinking it was different than our 1984 version!The did add the grass/sedge section but other books deal much better with this section than they did.I am not entirely pleased with many of the photos in this book, are out of focus or are just badly taken. What gives?Stick with the 1984 version and save some money."
1,wrong item,The photo that was posted on the item I ordered was not the item I received in the mail. I ordered a 50' extension cable for my Sirius radio i received 4 15' cables instead for some other Radio
2,In case you are thinking about buying kaplan cpa materials,"If you want to buy the complete package from the Kaplan cpa web then you have to know one thing, they tell you that you aren't alone and go ahead and buy the material whether its the complete package or the Essential_Solution but they lie. I have the complete package and I have sent them email after email and tried call all phone they gave me with no reponding. If you want to pass the cpa exam, I suggest to get a live class. If you have an access to a teacher or a live class I can see some benefits from reviewing the materials with Kaplan CPA."
3,Mine was not properly balanced,"When I mounted mine on my grinder, using the proper adapter, it was about 1/8 inch out of true, causing lots of vibration and some contact with the grinder's metal guard. When the thing going to spin at 11000 RPM, it needs to be exactly centered. The mounting system is not very robust: the threads are formed out of one turn of sheet metal, not a very precise design. I've had much better performance from the Norton Rapid Strip 04015 which has a metal casting for its threads. I've only been able to find the Norton at Sears, about $12.00.The abrasive itself worked well and seems to have about the same durability as the Norton."
4,Illegal Travel,"Maria and her family are trying to escape from El Salvador. The Gaurdias had killed her Papa. Now Maria, Oscar(her brother), and Julia (her pregnant sister)are all hiding in Chicago. Due to a raid on the place she worked, her best friend was sent back to El Salvador. Julia's baby was about due and she might have to go to the hospital, where most illegal Latino's are caught. To find out what happens to Julia you'll need to read the book. I enjoyed this book because it is a multicultural book based on an actual event in the past. I enjoyed it and I hope you read it, and like it as much as me.****"
2,Boring yet similar to my ancestors life,"""Journey of the sparrows"" was alright. It relates to my ancestors life. At the begining I was really into it then around chapter 8 or 9 it got very boring. The escaping from Mexico in a crait and hieding in the streets was intersting. Then When that lady took them a little intencity was taken away. Then when she got the job and was being harrased I got more interesed again. Fran Leeper writing style is great. She makes you feel like part of the book."
2,"""Hit the lit button""","I was so excited to buy the Phil Harmonic when I was still pregnant and the first stage is really soothing with beautiful music. And I still used it with my baby for the first few months. But then as the stages progressed the less soothing and interesting it became. To be honest the games in the fourth stage don't even make sense! It fact it's really annoying! Rather then let the child explore the sounds and music while pushing and sliding the buttons at a normal pace, the child hears ""hit the lit button"" over and over and over. Sad to say this one is collecting dust somewhere in my garage."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this product for my granddaughter as she loves lights, sounds, music and shapes. I do not know how children of any age could learn how to use this toy because my daughter-in-law and I both had a very difficult time trying to figure it out. My granddaughter does love the lights and the sounds. I cannot see how educational this toy could possibly be for anyone younger than 14 or older."
4,Keeps my baby very occupied!,I got this as a gift when my baby boy was born. I love it! The songs and rhymes are both soothing and attention grabbing. He loves watching the lights and now he is batting at the big buttons.
4,I like it the kids think it's ok,I was into this toy more than my kids. I like the music selections for Stage 1. They are so soothing. Neither of my kids got into the games for the older stages (6-18 mo.). However my nephew who is 6 enjoys the older stage games where they build songs with silly sounds.
2,misleading,"yes,there are some 1400 tables and a lot of data.But the entry like homeless population or gay populationare not here.and if you want to find out from this volume who we areas a country it is wrong book."
5,Beautifully Written,"Jaiya John shows immense courage as he gives the early details of his life's journey. His sensitivity and honesty triumph as he describes childhood illusion, confusion, and isolation. The way he tells his story, anyone can easily understand and relate to, regardless of background. The poetry throughout is brilliant. I read this book hoping to learn about the perspective of adopted children and children in foster care; I gained the perspective and insight I was seeking, but received much more in the reading of this memoir. I am grateful for the opportunity, and encourage others to experience this compelling story."
2,Bitter baby all grown up,"Having heard so many good things about this book, I was curious to read it and hoped that it would yield some valuable insights about raising our transracial family.Unfortunately, what I read was one man's bitter diatribe against his family and a conclusion that not only did his parents not love him well, but that he would never belong with them--a conclusion that both saddened and horrified me.I wasn't expecting for his road to be easy, but I had hoped that he would offer some more constructive, hopeful thoughts. Instead he comes across as angry and resentful."
5,Every teen wants one,"I took a lot of flack for buying my 16 year old one with her first car. She put it right up there on the dashboard. My religious friends thought it was blasphemous. Regardless of its origin my theory is there is nothing wrong with thinking of Jesus as your buddy, and if it makes her think of Him at all, then my job is done. So lighten up and put one in your kids car."
5,Love it!,I got this as a gift for someone who's difficult to buy for. Everyone really liked it. Unfortunately it took a dive off a high shelf onto a cement floor and it's thumbs up hand broke off. Act of God due to our blasphemous amusement at the expense of his son? Possibly. But this novelty toy was fun while it lasted.
5,Remove for Texas Heat Waves,"I thought he was going to melt during the Texas heat wave, but he withstood 3 months of 100 plus degree weather perfectly."
5,Refreshing new concept for Christians who like statuettes,"I was thunderstruck when I saw the film ""Dogma"" - as a Christian, and a Catholic, I was amazed by the fresh ideas in the film. I'm a fan of George Carlin, the comedian, and seeing him in the role of a ""doctor of the Church"" was hilarious, albeit totally irreverant. But I thought the notion of depicting Jesus as a life affirming, happy savior who approves of humanity (despite all our shortcomings) was uplifting. I bought this irreverant little statuette because I like thinking about Jesus as an affirming Son of the Diety. He is usually depicted as sorrowful, disappointed (he sure looks disappointed in us in most of the pictures and statues I've seen). Life is tough - it's even tougher now, with so many people becoming disaffected by religion. This is a positive image, worth looking at everyday - as it stands atop my TV. I like it a lot!"
5,Everyone should have a buddy.,"He's always smiling, and always cheerful. I've taken Buddy to London, Paris, a trip to the East Coast, and seveal times to Vegas. Buddy loves road trips. I attached velcro-type tape to the base so Buddy sits on my dash board and winks at pedestrians and vehicles every where."
4,"Very good, but not great Bruckner 8","This is a solid, well-performed Bruckner 8 by Maazel and the Berliners. The pros are Maazel's tempo choices, which are consistently well-judged at 16'19 / 14'18 / 26'12 / 23'39 // 79'32, and the excellent control and attention to detail that Maazel brings. The bad news is that this is a rather studio-bound and, even more disappointing, a rather earth-bound Bruckner 8. Maazel fails to bring that extra level of intensity and conviction to the work. At budget price, it is a good place to start, but you'll need to hear Furtwangler/VPO, Knappertsbusch/BPO, and Celibidache/MPO to find conductors who, in my opinion, really do this work justice."
5,awsome ED projector!!!,The 4805 Home Theater projector is a very nice machine.I bought my projector way back in the summer of 2005 and as Dec 06 it still going strong and I still have the orginal bulb.Yes this projector is an ED 480p but High Def stuff still looks great on it and I have an XBOX 360 along with the HD DVD add on hooked to the projector and it looks great-looks like HD to me.A very nice projector.
4,A Master tenor,This CD is fantastic.It is Rudolf Schock in his best years.More people arond the world should know Rudolf Schock.By ever recording by Rudolf Schock you can see the character in front of you.
2,Totally race obsessed,"It seems the goal of the book is to foment racial enmity in Latino college students. It is preoccupied with the word ""mestizo"": mestizo this, mestizo that, mestizo the other along with ""mestizo hater"".The book is full of half truths, 1/4 truths, insinuations and unsupported statements concerning people over the centuries from all races and racial mixtures of all nationalities (colonial and independent) from south of present Canada to north of present Guatemala.A good history would strive to set bias aside, not build a far side ""perspective"" derived from racial politics which is misrepresented as unvarnished fact."
5,Very Well Done Concert DVD,This is a first class DVD. Picture and sound are outstanding. Tom and the boys are in top form here. The eight bonus songs on disc 2 are very good. This band is so much better live. A lot of highlights on these two discs. If you ever thought about buying a Tom Petty DVD get this one.
3,Great concert - where are the extras?,"Many have complained about the number of cover songs, but it's the very reason I sought out this DVD. How many times to you need to hear ""Free Falling"" or ""Running Down a Dream""? I always love Tom's interpretation of other's songs. Many here I have never heard of before. As always, Mike Campbell's understated guitar is to die for. And alas, watching this makes me miss Stan Lynch. Great songs, great concert. Highly recommended.The back cover of the DVD lists the following extras: Biography, Backstage Pass, Bonus Tracks, Photo Gallery, Meet the Band, Discography and Interview. Only the Bonus Tracks appear on disc 2. Where are these other extras? Also, why 2 discs? With a running time of 109 minutes, wouldn't this have fit on one disc?"
1,"Horrible, Hey Tom, I hate getting old to okay?","Having seen Tom in the 80's and this was one of my all time concerts of the 80's, Mike smoked on the guitar! I was maybe 20 yards away right in front of him, and I went to dozens of concerts from many bands, this is slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Yes I know, we all get old. I can believe that, as I am, too. It was painful to watch this whole concert, I kept nodding off, ""HUH? its still on?""And this dvd is NOT closed Captioned, not cool.But I am not the one that has a 80's concert on VHS ONLY and sinse DVD's have been out for what, 10 years now? and so many bands have updated their VHS to DVD, Tom, its time toRelease Pack up the Plantation: Live in dvd NOW! And dont forget to Closed Caption it!!!"
2,Defective,"skips and freezes. tried it in 3 different players. The concert itself, when it didn't skip or freeze,was only OK"
2,dissapointed,The audio portion is very good. But the video portion is another story.The HD transfer is horrible. Not what I expected from a concert originally broadcast in HD. Looks OK on my laptop but the larger the screen the worse it appears. Most dvd's look good on my Blu-ray with 1080p upconversion - not this one. For Audio only.........
3,"So far, so good","I haven't actually cooked anything from the book but the recipes sound good and they seem easy enough to make. I would have liked the book to include a picture for each recipe--as the book is, there are onlly a few pictures. I do like that many of the main recipes also include short and easy secondary recipes for sauces, etc. to accompany the main dish if you want it."
4,Nelles Maps,"Thank goodness I finally found this Nelles Map a month before my trip to Oahu! It honestly was the only thorough map I found for this island in 8 months of searching both Hawaii visitor sites and book companies. This map gave great detail and was not so miniscule that I had to squint to read it. The only drawback (I felt) was the too large hard cover. The firmness of the cover was fine-it was just too large to squeeze into compact luggage pieces or vehicle cubbies. (This was my lone reason for withholding a star.)side note-I had located the Kauai and Big Island sister maps months before and used all 3 maps daily on our trip. The only map I found to offer better detailing of downtown areas was the Hawaiian airlines map-and they only offered ones for Kauai and the Big Island. All that said, my Nelles maps are the ones I have kept for return trips to Hawaii."
4,Good map of Oahu and major cities,"Shows the major routes around Oahu and has detailed inset maps of Honolulu, Kaneohe, and Lai'ie. The map of Honolulu in particular is very detailed. The print is real small though, so you need a magnifying glass (or really good eyesight) to read it."
2,horrible resource,"it has an awesome lab review section, but the review was nonexistant. I did not like how the book was put together or how it had a key terms section which did not explain the key terms. I am surprised that Cliffs would put out a book of this caliber. It's like the review was an afterthought compared to the lab section."
2,Not a good help!,"This book is not very good mainly due to the fact that it doesn't explain what it needs to when it comes to a topic. The book does not go as indepth as it needs to go to get the complete concept across. Instead I would request the REA AP Chemistry beceause it allows you to practice with 5 Practice Tests, and then goes over every answer individually to explain what you did wrong. It is a much better study aid."
2,Not Useful at All,"This book is completely useless. Basically it is a formula sheet on recycled paper. Don't let fancy colors fool you, there is nothing in this book. Apart from the lab sections and the reactions sections, this book falls flat on its face when it comes to conceptual questions, (which the AP Exam deals a lot with). Not worth the money."
2,Not so great,This book did not really review any of the material. it's great for practice questions but how will you answer them if you can't review? I had to buy another book....
5,Eclectic,"Ok so this artist is all over the map, musically as well as vocally. I have hooked all of my friends on this album and I don't thinks its gotten the credit it deserves.I have seen the singer 8o. and she dj's as well as sings, this record barely scratches the surface of her styles. She wails.Check it out."
4,Classic!,"This is an oldie but a goodie. Back in the day Sodom were it when it came to thrash. Lots of people considered their sound a cross between Slayer and (old) Metallica and yes that may be a good assumption but Agent Orange is definitly a classic thrash metal album. Perescution Mania IMHO is their best but Agent Orange comes in second. If you want to be educated in where thrash came from definitly pick this one up. I highly suggest you pick up Perescution Mania or better yet Mortal Way of Live which includes all the best Sodom songs played in a live setting in 1988. Trust me, when you listen to Mortal way of Live you can feel the energy they gave off. The only song that disturbs me is ""Incest"" Online there were rumors that Angelripper wanted his own sis. Yikes. Why sing about it!? Could just be a rumor back in the day.Again, this is classic. I recommend three classic Sodom CDs which include this one, Perescution Mania, and Mortal way of Live."
5,Great Store!,"This company is fantastic - everything ALWAYS ships quickly, arrives promptly, and undamaged."
1,I hate it,"Yes, I had the same problem I have windows 8 and this product does not work. So anyone with a new operating system should not buy it. This program may only work XP."
2,Not Compatible,"The product specifications for this product as listed on the page I ordered from claim that this is compatible with windows. While technically true, it is only compatible with some versions of Windows. I found out after installing it that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7. I think they should specify on the products details section which versions of Windows it is compatible with. I spent a fair amount of time installing this product, and then researching on the manufacturer's website on how to resolve the compatiblilty issue. There was no solution other than buy a more current version of the product. I am waiting to see if I will get a refund due to compatibility issues."
1,"A GREAT ALBUm, IF YOU KIKE HAIR-METAL",THis is one of the worst Heep albuns. Only the posterior EQUATOR is more commercial and pop. Blergh !!!
3,A little disappointed,"I somehow thought the book would consist of more cohesive and illuminating information, but what's here seemed like something anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of astrology could put together."
1,Don't bother...,"Not only is there little or no useful information in this book, it is so poorly arranged it is quite difficult to find specific references."
5,Outstanding,"I'm only writing this because, before reading this book, I really WAS A SKEPTIC. I received it as a gift and read it out of curiosity. As an experiment, I followed some of the advice for my Jupiter sign and was pleasantly surprised by the positive results. I just kept with it and noticed more and more dramatic improvements which I would have never imagined. I say to all you skeptics out there, give this book a try! YOU'LL BE AMAZED."
5,THE REAL DON STEELE A LEGEND,"FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS MOVIE(75) IWAS 5 YEARS OLD AND IT STILL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS TO DATE. carradine as frankenstein, sly as joe paturbo and the real don steele as junior perhaps the greatest death by car scenes bar none. roger corman is a genius."
2,Stick to original 35mm format,"I agree with ""Willjamz"" on the 1.85:1 conversion. This film was shot in 35mm, so see the ""full frame"" version for it's native format - you can't add to the frame to make it wide screen, so material is instead trimmed from the horizontal rather than the vertical. Nothing was trimmed for the ""full frame"" version as compared to films shot in 1.85:1 or 1.78:1 or even the massive 2.35:1 (now 2.39:1). As for the movie - a definite must for any collector! Best viewed as part of a beer and pizza movie night."
4,Good old movie,The remake was terrible in my book because it took away from the brutal race that that this one is. The story is a little thin but the race if funny if you have a dark side to you. Not an Oscar winner or anything but a good fun movie from back in the day. There is nudity (full front female) so not for the kids.
1,"a gave as a gift :-( n it didn't play right , had to press play aftet every seen","was not good did not play like it supose to , kept stopping after every sene . it was sad cause I gave it as a gift n dust work right :-( they should give me a DVD that work right"
1,Death Race 2000,"I received this movie (VHS) and it will not play in any players I have. It turns and you can hear garbled noises, but it turns so slowly that it just won't play. I am pretty upset that I payed money for this but I will make sure to not purchase any more from that particular store. I really think someone should make sure their merchandise is in good condition, at least working condition, before selling it, especially older titles such as this!"
4,This is Hilarious!!!!!!,"When I first saw this film I was in shock. David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone star in the futuristic comedy about a race from the east coast to west coast where killing people is encouraged for points. Although Sylvester Stallone's acting reaked awfully like some 22 day old cooked chicken left on the counter, the film was trully a funny flick for people who enjoy sick humor and get a kick out of unnecessary violence."
4,The greatest of the cheesy,"Not overly violent,but enough to get some peoples attention.It's funny as (. . .) ... with Stallone ""Joe viterbo"" in desperate need of anger management classes.For example, he ""scores"" his own pit crew.And ""Frankenstein"" David Carradine(A dear friend of mine :) ) is pretty good in this concidering the subject matter..They really seemed to having a lot of fun while making this."
1,One of Stallone's worst movies ever made,"I decided to watch this movie, because I happen to be a fan of Stallone, but this movie was poorly directed, and poorly made. Stallone did a great job acting in it, and the plot was, a little sketchy. It was sort of unclear and hard to follow. It was a good idea to make a movie that had this kind of popular sport in it, but like I said, the acting and casting was ok, but the directing, and the plot made this movie plunge into the dark pits of wrath. I only recommend this movie for Sylvester Stallone fans who have the extra time and patience to sit and see Stallone act."
4,Top 3 low budget science fiction movies of all time,"This movie is watchable time and time again. How can you beat a young Sylvestor Stallone? The off-beat humor cannot be topped. I rate this as one of the top three low budget science fiction movies ever. The other two: ""A Boy and his Dog"" and ""Creation of the Humanoids"". It is my favorite Roger Corman movie also. But ... do yourself a favor and pass on the bogus sequel called ""Deathsport"". The original has a certain magic but the second try does not. Well, I have to go now there are still some pedestrians left in the world."
1,"False Advertising, Amazon!","I purchased Death Race 2000 based on the previous review, citing extras and superior quality compared to a previous Digital Multimedia release. But this copy I received appears to be that very inferior previous version mentioned: no extras, dreadful sound and picture.Don't be fooled like I did! You really have to view the fine print and sometimes do a little homework. This is the SECOND time I've received an utterly worthless (to me) pirate-quality release of a classic motion picture when ordering from Amazon. Shame on you, Amazon! Exercise a little quality control and stop mixing and matching reviews with different pressings of the same movie. There is a world of difference.This SUCKS!"
1,"Great movie, *AWFUL* DVD","Whoever did the transfer of this edition should be forced to watch it over and over without possibility of parole. The picture is ""ghost""-ridden and, in some places, looks overexposed. Toward the end of the movie, the sound loses synchronization with the picture. Avoid this edition at all costs. It's bad enough to make you want to give up DVD as a medium."
4,the best it's ever looked!,"Just gotta say...they'll put anything on blu-ray! It's hard to imagine Roger Corman and high definition in the same thought, but lo and behold-we're getting his 'cheap' flicks on blu-ray! Who would ever 'thunk it'? The quality of the disc is nothing to write home about...but the movie is outrageous! Campy classic!! Just wish it looked as good as Corman's ""Rock and Roll High School"" on blu. That version colors really 'shine'...this movie looks dull in comparison. Still, it's the best it's ever looked! Lookin' forward to more Corman Classics on blu!!"
3,Condition exaggerated,The movie was rated in excellent condition however when we viewed it there was 3 or 4 times that the picture went completely dark. Audio continued but there was nothing on the screen.
5,...the most popular sporting event in the history of mankind,"Super-schlock film by offbeat cheesemeister Paul Bartel. This film has it all, hokey dialogue ""battered, shattered, creamed and reamed - the world loves you Frankenstein!"" , bad acting, dodgy FX, and ridiculous characters. True Brilliance. Never takes itself seriously (although David Carradine does try) as racers compete for points by winning race stages across america and killing pedestrians on the way. I guess its the only film to feature a ""Euthanasia Day"". This film is an absolute icon of 70's budget sci-fi. Even Stallone doesn't do a bad job."
3,This one is something else!,"Well, Death Race 2000 marks one of the first movies by Sylvester Stallone and one of many by David Carradine. This movie was made in 1975 and it shows it. The basic story is about a race from New York City to Los Angeles in a futuristic (yet Bizarre) year 2000. This movie could fall under Science Fiction, Action and Comedy. Its interesting to say the least. The cars are cool, the acting is ok. If you do not like violence, I wouldnt recommend this movie. It can be Brutal at times. Definitely rent this one before you buy it. Its good but it isnt great."
3,The original Death race,"Having seen the remake, I was curious about the original and how it would hold out after so many years. Being a B grade movie fan, it's not bad, not bad at all. While a little over the top by today's standards (maybe not) and underwhelming in the gore department, it's better than most movies of the 70's era. All in all, a movie that hasn't aged well by normal standards but if you're a B-grade fan, a must watch at least once"
2,hmm . . .,"did the makers of Carmegeddon see this movie? Well, I think having said that anyone who's played the game will know pretty much what to expect. I once heard someone say that this movie was supposed to be some kind of social satire, on Social Darwinism or something? Well, that is very difficult to believe. Sylvester Stallone's non-porn debut (yes, it's true, he used to make porn movies) is an all-out blood n gore fest, complete with ludicrous over-acting, campy gags, naked women and cheesy spatter-type special effects. While not everyone's cup of tea, and it's certainly not Ingmar Bergman, it is very fast-moving and fun (what could you expect from Roger Corman) and probably contains one of the highest cinema body-counts this side of Peter Jackson's Braindead. Rumour has it that a remake is in the works called Death Race 3000. Should be fun."
5,review from edinburgh,"This is a great film there is plenty of gory violence e.g. someone's head being crushed by Sylvester Stallone's car. One of the best motoring movies ever. Comparable to Mad Max II, only more blood."
1,Watched this as a kid ...,I think I understand why my Dad took us to the drive in to watch this ... the nudity.It's amazing what passed for entertainment in those days.This movie sucks!Cool plotBad actingGreat TNAThe only redeeming factor was its terseness.Death Race is not even in the same league.Watch it instead!;)
1,Grade Z.,"This movie has not aged well. Set in the near future, a jaded population is entertained by a road race in which points are accumulated by killing pedestrians -- the more helpless, the greater the point value.The screenplay is atrocious; the acting is terrible (I think the cast was bored); the special effects are amateurish.Sometimes, a bad movie can be funny to watch. This one's just painful. Pass it by."
1,soooooooo very bad,"I watched this for the first time last night and boy was I disappointed. What was the purpose of this movie? It was wrong on so many fronts. The acting was horrid, the speacial effects were sub-par, and the plot was as poorly written as anything thing that I have ever seen. This was really bad movie. I am suprised that Sly was never able to make other movie again after this. Barrow it, rent it, download it but do not waste $20 of your hard earned money on this."
4,Death Race 200,"A Comedic campy film. Should enter the Cult Classic Category along side Rocky Horror Picture Show and others. I gave it to my oldest grandson, in college, he had never seen it I told him it was Stallone Pre-Rocky/Rambo and just shortly after Lords of Flatbush. He also found it funny along with his college mates, none of whom had seen it. ""Preposerously Funny"". ""Pure Camp"". You can see Carradine is doing it tongue in cheek. My 8yr. old grandson laughed himself silly."
3,Classic B Movie,"This is one of the classic B movies of the 60's and 70's. The movie was filmed on a minimal budget and you can see that in the designs and special effects. If you like a movie to have a message Death Race 2000 addresses the future of violence in America. You just have to remember the movie was filmed 30 years ago. Or you can just ignore that and enjoy a spoof about a car race. The interplay between the characters is hilarious, and the road race sequences are fun."
4,Great (Bad) Movie - DVD could be better,"One of my alltime favorite movies. Yes, the acting is bad, the special effects are bad, but the movie is fun to watch. :)"
3,road rage adventure,"This is a cheesy movie - part comedy, part road movie, part science fiction. Involves a good deal of low buck violence and nudity. I watched it for the cars which was disappointing, unlike the Gumball Rally, which features some real machines, this has old Corvettes with plastic fangs and other junk. Not a very P.C. film but if that's what your in the mood for, it goes down well in an odd, B-movie kind of way."
3,Cheesy Fun.,"Not as good as I remember form my childhood,(back then running over people to score points was considered controversial). Still lots of fun though. Check out Sly on the cover art. That silly grin should prepare you for the inane( but funny) premise of this film. Vehicular high-jinks aplenty!!!"
2,"OK, but not as good as I expected","The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected."
4,Death Race,"Created back in a time before CGI, the movie was made. Back when actors had to do their own stunts for minor action, ""set builders"" did wood & nail construction, and ""car's"" did not act like ""Kitt"" or the ""Mach 5"".I watched this this film way back in the late 70's early 80's, and never forgot it. I am pleased that I now own a little piece of film history. I'm glad I do not need 3D glasses to watch Death Race,, just a Coke Cola and pop corn. You can not beat a few hours of fun for the price."
4,Great Movie,I loved it growing up and now I own it to watch when ever I want :)It's classic that I don't mind sharing with friends and family.
3,70's cheese,"I got this movie to compare it to the newer version. I had seen it when I was younger and had thought the cars were pretty cool and the plot interesting. Almost 40 years later, it was definately a B movie, with poor acting, poor scripting, poor stunts and filming (you can tell they sped up the film to make the cars look like they were driving faster). The cars weren't as modified as I remember, David Carradine's acting was his typical, but it passed a couple of hours away thinking how far movies have come from the 1970's. There was also a fair amount of T & A which I hadn't seen when I first saw it, and was a surprise when I watched with my kids."
5,Will buy more stuff from seller,I recived my dvd in plenty of time and in new shape totally awesomw doing busness with you
3,Poor copy of a poor movie.,"Wanted my own copy of this poorly done movie. This is a poor quality reproduction/copy of this movie. Crappy movie, crappy cd, perfect! Got what I paid for."
5,This movie has it all,This is a untypical movie for it time. It was a Sci-Fi low budget that used the best it had. It gives new defination to road rage. This is one of the all time classic Sci-Fi road race movies. If you like Carmageddon the PC game you'll love Death Race 2000.
1,a rip-off!,a two year old could have made a better copy of this dvd. you suck! Any body buying from you people should be warned in advance that theyre about to be taken!
4,"Great movie, definitely better than the 08 remake","A great movie. Definitely nothing more than a simple plot with lots of violence and car stunts. It goes outside the boundaries of what today would be considered politically correct, even for a movie, and that is what makes Deathrace 2000 great. Where else would you get to see ""euthenasia day"" at the hospital? I just wish the newer version was as ballsy."
5,Just as I remebered It.,"Seen this in the drive in when it first came out.Watched it with my 15yr old son who agreed even though the special effects were lame and the acting wasn't anybodys best,this is still a great movie with some very funny moments in it."
4,Fun Movie,"This is a fun movie to watch, it has that 70's charm to it. If you don't nit-pick the hell out of it and just watch it for what it is. You'll find it to be a very enjoyable movie to watch."
4,Death Race 2000,This is the movie that started the Death Race movies. The only things different are the way they terminate people and the vehicles used.
2,God Movie,"This is a good movie, but one that I would watch once in a while. Sylvester Stallone does a good job in it. It's a bit cheesy compared to now a days. Decent action in it."
3,Exploitation fun,"The Bottom Line:No one is going to mistake Death Race 2000 for a good film, but if you're in the mood for some fun low budget effects, gratuitous nudity, and terrible acting (including an uber-young Sylvester Stallone tripping over every line of dialogue!) with just a smidgen of social commentary, this could be your movie.2.5/4"
5,Wonderful bloodthirsty road movie,"This is a cheesy, exciting and entertaining B movie. It's fast paced and funny, with some fantastic jokes and very entertaining violence.Clearly a big influence on Mad Max, this one has a remake out but check out the original!Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,Great book on a great man,"These left wingers make me sick. If you guys hate it here so much, LEAVE! God bless Bush, God bless Reagan & God bless America"
5,a book for the ages,"This was the best book I have ever read. It will stand the test of time and truly be on everyones shelf before this century is over. Bush will always be the man we loved and trusted. Thankfully, this book will rewrite our society to a better tomorrow."
1,The worst product $9.47 can buy.,Fire is the only use I can find for this garbage.Usually politics and religion should never mix.Christianity and government should be kept completely separate.Killing people in wars due to our religion differences is the consequence.Because of Bush being so religious and going into wars America is hated many.Until Bush resigns there will be no end to this tyranny.Somehow he thinks he is the ultimate ruler and can do anything he wants.However one day his mistakes will be realized by many just like Germany after the war.
4,Such a good Book,"Regardless of the critiques of others that say that bush should keep religion and government separate, this book shows exactly what bush's ideas, and what his intentions are for the country. The speeches in this book really emphasize in Bush's main points, I think this a great book to read if you have doubts or questions on what would the President will do next."
1,God Help Us,"Little Bush is almost as genuine a Christian as Bill Clinton. I am praying for the book of other great Presidents speeches that rely on the Lord's help. Like JFK in the Cuban Missile Crisis and FDR during World War II, and Truman in Korea. Yes these men, like W. were all nothing, with no talents, intelligence or personal strength. It was all prayer and faith alone that carried them, and ultimately us."
1,The Biggest Liar,"A friend of mine let me borrow this book. I found it to be filled with lies. President Bush has lied to the American people and this book proves it. Presdident Bush's ideas of faith, principle and patriotism are not my idea faith, principle and patriotism. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,A Message for 2004,"This book lays out Bush's excellent plans for once he took office. None of these plans have materialized. It's not what you say George, it's what you do."
2,If only...,"It is difficult to seperate the text of the book to the actions of the man. I don't think we need a book to judge the actions of the most viewed man in the world. The book only goes to show his claim to God based faith. If only the intentions developed into reality. The book makes as much sense as John Doe, Shift Manager of McDonalds: On God and Country."
2,"""The Sopranos"" is better","Those readers in search of an engrossing chronicle of a criminal family are directed instead to the HBO television series ""The Sopranos.""At no point in this disappointing volume does Bush discuss anything central to his career -- nothing about Enron, Medellin, Chernobyl or Skull and Bones. Nor does he touch on Laura's conviction for vehicular homicide.I was very disappointed. Surely George can do better."
1,A load of hooey,Anything good about this book would have to be the result of dubya's speech writers. It's a shame we don't have a president who we believe could actually write a book.
3,A bargain Ninth for lovers of the Vienna Phil. (maybe),"Why EMI made Muti a golden boy in the first place one will never know, but it's obvious why his large discography has nose-dived to the bottom of the bargain bin. In German classics he is efficient and faceless, never allowing a smile or a tender moment, and bringing not a shred of an idea to the podium. The Vienna Phil. plays very well here, but with all repeats expanding the symphony's ""heavenly length"" to over an hour, Muti's impersonal march through the score wears thin very quickly."
2,Uncrafty,"After watching a Charlie Rose interview with Alan Furst who claimed Ashenden was ""the greatest spy novel written"" I beg to differ. NO tension, NO intrigue and obviously didn't ""reel"" me in. I actually inspired my book club to put this title on our list of must reads. Thank goodness I have time to change the list. I expected much much more."
1,Deceptive photo,"Quality of this item is okay, but the picture is deceptive. In looking at the picture it appears you are buying three snaps, however you only receive one."
2,Wasn't that great,"I was tracking this product hardcore and on the day that was suppose to arrive, it didn't come. I was home all day, and nothing. I didn't receive any notes or anything, but the website said person wasn't home, which is bull because I was home all day. I suppose that's UPS's fault though.The sneaker itself wasn't what I expected. Yes it did look like what it was on the picture, but when I looked carefully, it looked like it was put together poorly. The top pieces of the sneaker, the plastic part with the lace holes were misaligned to the sneaker. Towards the toe, also misaligned pieces."
4,A typical product of the Sawallisch era in Philadelphia,"EMI has stuck with the Philadelphia Orchestra going back to Ormandy in his old age and continuing through Muti and Sawallisch. As a result of this devotion they've gotten a barrelful of gorgeously played but musically compromised recordings. The best reading here is of the Dvorak Seventh, which shows quite a lot of energy and commitment on Sawallisch's part. As middle-of-the-road musicmaking goes, it certainly can compete with Masur, for example, but pales beside Kertesz.In the Cello Concerto Sawallisch sounds seriously dull, and his slack tempos do little to invigorate Natalia Gutman's rather modest, recessed reading of the solo part. Rostropovich has nothing to fear. EMI was probably right to salvage Sawallisch's Dvorak symphonies on a super-budget line, where they are good value for the money."
2,For Tauber fans only.,My problems with this CD are several. With over 20 selections perhaps 7 or 8 are bona fide classics. Far too many seem to be inccluded because they were written or co-writtrn by Tauber. They are less than steller. He should not have sung in English - the accent is extreme. Can non-English singers not learn to stop rolling R's? Even the songs he sings in German are hindered by his propensity to hop up and down octaves to suit his comfort zone. Too bad. No doubt a great artist but not on this CD.
5,Interesting and Useful reading for Players of all levels,"This book is refreshingly different from the normal bridge book the reader comes across. For one, it talks about the bridge scenario in India, which has never been captured before. The problems discussed are interesting and the analysis is thorough. Players of all levels should find this a useful reading material."
4,works pretty good,"I have 2 of these they work pretty good, the unit comes with good software and a UPS to RJ45 cable so you can monitor the UPS performance on your PC and adjust various settings. I recommend the APC batteries they last longer they can last at least 3 to 4 years of continuous PC use . I have a lot of other peripherals and it can easily handle the voltage demands. Instruction are clear and easy to understand also the unit keeps you informed through the beeps and flashing lights as to the difference states it is experiencing."
3,Happy HP Girl!!!,"Works like it is supposed to, no complaints. This is my second unit and they both work great."
4,Hege Rimestad in the garden!,"I have so enjoyed this music in our spring garden. Seems to reflect the season very well, and so, even better to hear on a winters night. My wife and I highly recommend this wonderful music. Get the CD. Plant something!"
1,An OCR abomination!,"This text is a fraud--in the sense that it does not match the Contents online. It is also without a Contents or Index, and is unreadable. Many of the lines of the poem are run together into long paragraphs. The title and advertized contents promise ""Other Poems""; there are none."
1,No customer support,I was in the market for clothes pins with holes. I found a photo of what I was looking for and ordered. I received the clothes pins but the package did not resemble the photo on the website and there were no holes in the clothes pins. I emailed them twice and have yet to hear from them. I'm tired of waiting so am sending this negative response. I recommend you not do business with this vendor.
5,22 months later and still keeping perfect time...,"I can't stop looking at my left wrist.. :-) While on vacation in the Caribbean, I stopped in a Little Switzerland shop and this particular TagHeuer watch caught my eye.. When I returned to the States, I started doing research on the Internet and found the exact watch at Amazon for considerably less.. Well, I am a regular at Amazon and it didn't take long before I placed my order. Mmmmm.. this watch is truly the cat's meow.. It's beautiful/classy AND rugged/sporty at the same time.. NOW, my husband wants one too!!"
3,Nupro Joint Supplement,We have been using the Nupro product for just undr 4 weeks so it is too early to notice a difference in coat/itching etc. The 'gravy' has a very strong smell.....garlic/meat/liver which can be a little overwhelming first thing in the morning. One of my dogs was slightly put off by the smell....too strong. He eventually got used to it. (We feed mainly a raw diet so his food has no odor ar all.)
5,Nupro Joint Support,This product is one of the best powders I've ever used on my Dogs. They have more energy and can move around alot faster. We will continue to purchase this item repeatedly. The price is just right too!! Thank you
5,Great Product,"I've been using Nupro for the past two years, and my dogs have had excellent results. The joint issues have dissapated and their coats are beautiful."
4,"use in moderation, weight gain possible.","I noticed both of my dogs gained weight while on this. I found the weight gain to offset the health benefit, so I stopped giving them this supplement.They have since returned to their normal weight. Both dogs are small dogs, a 12lb Lhasa Apso, and a 22lb mutt. On the supplement, both dogs gained 3 lbs."
1,GARLIC !!!,"We had the same problem as D.Case reported in another review. We purchased the 5 pound Nu Pro Silver to help our dear Angel, a Yellow Labrador therapy dog, with the hip discomfort she's developed. We mixed it as instructed into a gravy and set it down before normally voracious Angel and she actually backed away from it. We thinned it out more and still noticed just how strong the garlic smell is. She wouldn't touch it. We then mixed just half the gravy with a can of food. She still wouldn't eat it ! We were shocked because she is not finicky. We could not get her to accept her food with the supplement unless we used only 10 percent the recommended dosage...and that just won't have the benefit we need. The garlic smell is pervasive after adding water. We feel there should be some warning in descriptions of the product. We are happy other doggies are benefiting from Nu Pro Silver but wanted people to know that the strong garlic smell puts off some dogs. Peace."
5,Timothy is back to his young self!,"I began Timothy, our 11 year old Springer Spaniel, on this at the end of May after our vet sold us a very expensive small container. Then i purchased the 5 pounder & am ready to order more. Timothy is now able to go up & down the stairs and keeps up on our 3 mile walks again. Awesome product. Well worth the dinero."
5,Works as advertised,"I just ordered my second can of Nupro Silver, after seeing how much difference it has made for my eight year old collie. He was experiencing a lot of stiffness in his joints -- he was slow getting up and just couldn't run and jump like he used to. After giving him this supplement for a few weeks, he's a lot more active and cheerful. Almost like a puppy again. If I weren't a vegetarian, I'd be tempted to try it myself!"
5,It's the Best!,I have tried many other arthritis supplements and this one is by far the best! My ol doggie bounds and runs like a pup again! I just mix it with some water and it makes a gravy that my usually picky pup loves! If I mix it up the night before it thickens up.I like it so much I ordered the 20 lb size!
1,"Bad design, low sound quality","OK, we're not talking high-end speaker systems here. We're talking basic plug-in speakers on a little iPod with a minimal amplification power (it is designed for headphones), so I wasn't expecting big sound or beefy stereophonics. However, I was expecting better than what this provides.First, the design is awkward. It's overly large and heavy to balance on the top of your iPod. It has a tendency to swivel and come off if you move it. If you have a skin on, it won't plug in properly at all.Second, and IMO more importantly, the tones were horribly tinny, there is next to no midrange and barely any bass unless you change your EQ to bass booster. I feel as if I would have better sound if I cranked up the volume and pumped the music through my little ear buds.Overall, I strongly recommend against this."
1,sorry I bought it,tinny sound - big mistake to have purchased it - invest in a couple of auxiliary speakers instead
1,One Step Below Useless,"It sounded like a good idea but ""what looks good from afar is often times far from good."" Even with a brand new Duracell alkaline battery this thing sounded like a cheap transistor radio when attached to my iPOD. To be fair, I gave it a shot on my Sony Discman and my SIRUS receiver and the sound was equally bad. If you want this thing for playing music, then save your money (as I should have done)."
1,Don't bother if you have a Nano,"In a word, these suck. The sound is not much louder than spillover from a really loud set of headphones. Not worth the money. Utter crap if you've got a Nano."
1,This weighs 10 pounds?,"OK, so I haven't bought this yet...but I'm thinking about it. I just don't understand why the product dimension and product weight shown is 10 lbs.... is it just me, or is that ridiculous?"
2,low volume,I was expecting a louder volume from the product in order to share the listening experience with others.
1,Speakers blow out easily,DO NOT USE THESE IF YOU PLAN TO BLAST MUSIC! THEY WILL BLOW OUT WITHIN A DAY! AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS HORRIBLE!
2,Handy but weak,"These speakers are small, but sound that way. They remind me of what a little transistor radio use to sound like. One of my mp3 players would not even power it enough to be heard. My iPod Mini produced enough sound to be heard slightly across a room. I would not recommend this speaker system."
2,Not worth it,Volume is to low and if you forget to turn off the volume the battery is dead the next time you use it.
2,Novelty A+ Sound F-,These are just not worth my time or money. They only provide a tinny low volume output. It's only positive feature is for use when you want to listen to you ipod classic and have nothing else to use.
3,Macally Podwave Portable Stereo Speaker,I bought this product for my iPod to use in my car. It's hard to hear over car noise. It doesn't have a good stereo sound. I now use it on my P.C. and is O.K. just a little tiny sounding.
1,terrible sound quality,"Purchased this having read the mixed reviews and decided to take my chances. When I got the product, I was shocked at how little volume it projected. As one reviewer said, laying your earbuds on the table and turning the ipod volume up all the way is louder than the sound these speakers make when turned up to their highest capacity. This product was totally useless as the sound was so faint and volume so low that might as well have not been on at all. TERRIBLE product. Returned it promptly."
3,iPod speakers,"The main reason that I am keeping these is because of their novelty and convenience. Even cranked up, they're not very loud. At just over $30, the sound quality is fair to good at best, as significant distortion occurs whenever any bass or volume aspects are introduced. The poorer your download source, the poorer the quality of sound. If you are having a beanie baby party, these would make a great boombox; otherwise, they are pretty cool to schlep around in your pocket to use as needed. They will work with most devices and are best used on your desk or table. However, don't expect Bose quality!"
1,One step above useless,"This item is flawed from many perspectives, but the most important is that the sound it gives off is faint at best. I bought it to listen to my iPod in the car, and it's not loud enough to be heard over road noise. The only way to hear it is to hold it up to your ear while you drive, which isn't safe.Also, from a design POV, it swivels around annoyingly because it doesn't have a second pin to fit into the lateral second hole atop the iPod, which both the iTrip (which is also useless) and the iTalk (which works pretty well) have. Granted, these second pins and the iTalk and the iTrip are functional. But it really wouldn't take much to attach a dummy pin to stop the swivelling. A minor point, but nonetheless irritating.Not worth the admittedly low price."
3,You get what you pay for,"If you're looking for something compact that matches your ipod and is very portable...this may be the option for you. Just be prepared to sacrifice sound quality for portability. I think my game boy speakers sound better than this...but it looks cute and works for the purpose I am going to need it...probably at work at my desk. The plug's connection is not very good, so I always feel like it's going to fall out. It's always moving all over the place. I think this is because of the hold switch on the ipod. It would have been better if Macally had built in a small groove in the bottom that could fit the hold switch. This would make it more flush with the unit and also help hold it in place. Right now I can spin mine like a beanie hat."
1,too expensive little sound,"I purchased mine about a month ago to use in the office or hotels. Sadly, it simply is not loud enough. With my ipod at maximum volume, this speaker produces only faint sound."
2,Barely any sound,"I'm not needing a lot of sound...mostly wanting some quiet background music while reading, traveling, etc. But you can barely hear with this speaker."
1,Do not buy!!!!,It does not work! I was so excited to see it and loved how small it is. But I cannot hear it unless the room is silent. It goes through batteries quickly and just really is useless. Too bad I did not read the reviews before I made the purchase.
2,Better than Nothing; Below Average Performance,"The Podwave, at first glance, looks like it would provide useful sound when connected to the iPod (or other portable audio devices, for that matter). The size is good, it weighs very little, and is easy to use. Unfortunately, the sound quality and volume is *very* lacking. I even tried ramping up the level of the signal feeding into the Podwave with a portable ""Boosteroo"" pre-amp, and that didn't much improve matters (using an iPod Nano as the signal source). I think that with better components (slightly larger speakers, better amp, and a short extension cable) the Podwave would be useful. As it stands, it's more of a ""better than nothing"" gadget. If you need high quality and portability, take a look at the JBL OnTour (larger, but much more capable) which is only $70-something if you shop frugally."
2,tin,"With technology what it is being able to cram incredible sound into tiny spaces (witness the incredibly expensive Bose tiny shelf speakers) it is amazing that the company that made this was not too embarrassed to put this tinny (and I don't mean tiny), barely audible set of speakers it on the market. It would cost more money to return this to Amazon to keep it and thus is the end of this story. . ."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this to use with an ipod touch and the speaker that is built into the ipod is better than this thing. The sound is horrible and distorted.
2,meh,"the sound quality isn't much better than my stock iPhone speakers, plus it's quite clunky and heavy for its size when attached to your device. most portable device i could find which was good, but otherwise not worth it."
3,An ok item,"So I bought this for around $8 on Amazon. On the package it says it comes with a battery included, but did not. There is a little static feedback sometimes. If you use a case of your phone most likely you will have to take it off to use this speaker. I am giving this to my kid and buying a nicer one."
2,poor design,"Poor design- speakers fire up & down in relation to ipod or only one speaker fires at you at 90* rotation. No power lite so easy to forget its on, low volume and tinny at max input. OK for a quiet environment but even low background noise will wash it out. Keep looking- there are better front firing units here for about $10 more- very well worth spending the extra money."
1,very dissatisfied,"The very first time I used this, I put the speaker in my pocket after turning off my ipod. A couple of hours later, I took the speaker out of my pocket, and the on/off switch had broken off. I could not be any less satisfied."
4,Take it for what it is...,"I use this little item at work with my MP3 player and it's more than adequate for this function. I'm didn't purchase this item expecting it to have fantastic output or sound, but to allow me to listen to music in the background in the cubicle. For this purpose, it works fantastically. If you need higher fidelity, shop around for a larger active travel speaker."
2,the volumen is not enough,"When I put this device in my mp3 player, I espect listen the music but I need a room completly silent and obviusly that no was my intention."
2,Ernies Ark,"Boring. Just did not care for it. I read about three chapters and could not get into it so never finished it. If I run out of good stuff,may give it another try."
4,A Safe Haven,"A very well-written collection of inter-connected stories set in a small milltown in Maine. The paper mill is on strike, disrupting lives and family loyalties. Change is inevitable, and the stories detail how individuals react and adjust to it. One of the characters in particular, Francine, made me ache for her. Early teens, out of place in all places, shunned by her peers and overlooked by most adults, yet sweet-tempered and ever hopeful. And then there's Ernie - who builds an ark for his dying wife - that's right, an ark. The more I think about the stories, the more I realize how well-drawn the characters are. The town may be in trouble, but it wouldn't be a bad place to live."
4,Ernies Ark,Very good! Recommend if u are interested in responses to death and dying plus responses to others. Father son relationship interesting. Actually a love story also. Enjoyed it!
4,Nice read,I liked the way the story went off into the different characters in the book and how they all were connected. nice easy and enjoyable read.
2,A couple sweet stories; a few boring ones.,"This is a collection of stories based around common characters in a small town.Some of the stories are entertaining, some try to be poignant, and others seemjust pointless. I finally got bored and didn't finish the last half of the book.None of the characters were developed well enough to make me really care whathappened to them."
5,This Is REAL Christian Punk,"This is my favorite hardcore punk band...they put more energy into their music than any other band I've ever heard. This album has SO many good songs to offer, with such strong, powerful, worshipful lyrics. These guys are Christians and not afraid to let everybody know it! Check out the song ""Venit, Victimarius Fuit, Vicit"" which means, ""He Came, He Died, He Conquered"". All praise to Christ Jesus who died for our sins! I recommend these guys if you like Lugnut, Minor Threat, or Officer Negative."
2,If you are a programmer....keep looking,"Wolberg reminds me of certain college professors that I had who excelled at generating a great deal of theorical and mathematical concepts, but never really could offer a practical implementation or application. I bought this book in hopes of learning how to correct aerial and satellite photos. However, the only insight that Wolberg gave to me was a series of equations, followed by the repeated statement that 'you can use these to correct remote sensor data'. Thanks...I already knew that......."
3,The programing was good but the shipping wasn't.,The dvds were informative but the condition of their package was a mess. Every dvd container was broken and I had to buy a new one to put them in.
4,Needed some tweaking,"The color is great and the lace pattern is pretty. I ordered this because I thought it was the perfect mix of what my husband would like (sheer) and elegant enough for me to feel comfortable (length and style).I thought something was strange when I put it on, cheap like. I figured out it was the lace up ribbon. It was not laced the same way as the picture. Fewer crosses and too wide apart. I took it out and laced it every four loops and made sure the ribbon was satin side out. It looks so much better!The top is smaller than I expected. In the picture it looks like it has more coverage than expected. I am a c or D cup and it is almost too small to look right. Larger ladies may want to pass on it."
1,Ugh,"I'm disgusted. To begin with the entire 10 volumes are in two HUGE files(talk about reader unfriendly). Next the interface is awful, you can't open the text inside of Notepad or Word, just inside of a reader that comes with it. The reader by the way is clunky and cramped and about as convenient as reading an Encyclopedia on 20,000 3x5 notecards.If you are like me the only reason you're looking at this is you didn't want to pay 'an arm and a leg and a liver' for the 10 volume set. This is NOT an acceptable substitute so until someone reprints the original we are all up the creek."
3,Romex strippers,"They are good enough for the money and my purposes. these are not designed to be used for everyday work by a professional electrician. They are of utility value and the price of them is reflective of that,"
3,WONDERFUL DVD - EXCEPT!,"I love everything about the old planations especially in Louisiana. This DVD is wonderful - except the last part of the DVD is messed up. I returned the first one that I received and a second one was sent to me, however it is messed up the same as the first. I am assuming now that all of them are messed up on about the last 10 minutes of the DVD. It is very interesting and shows several of the old houses that now are in ruin."
1,Enron Defender,"I agree with a previous reviewer's comment that the book is a long advertisement for White's consulting business, which had to include that motherlode of creativity, Enron, although she doesn't admit it in the book and offers some lame upfront comment about regardless of what happens to Enron it's to be admired for it's creativity. The quotes from Skilling are ""great"" entertainment when you consider they occured all pre-meltdown, but the author's defense of Enron's ""creativity"" (which resulted in the loss of billions of dollars and had a negative impact on millions of lives) really turned me off.Instead of trying to justify the inclusion of such a ethically bankrupt company such as Enron, the author should have added a chapter on, when creativity turns criminal."
2,Very disappointing,"This book is an advertisement for her consulting business. It'sa sad poorly designed and poorly written book. With so many books on creativity out there, don't waste your money on this one."
3,Disappointing,"This book starts off slow, or was it me looking for excitment due to the title of the book? There were too many characters to get a feel for each of them; however, Nina's role should have been Topez's role. It's Topez who's deeply involved in the singing business. Let's stick to the main characters, since this is suppose to be a sequal. I expected this to be off the hook just as Chocolate Affair (a five-star book). Sheila, please make a sequal and please let Topez, Nina and Keisha have interesting roles. Take this Charetta character (too much attitude, player hater, etc.)out for good, don't let her come back in the sequal. This book could have been better, take your time with the next one. I'm sure to buy it."
5,Great Read,I enjoyed this book. Terrific read. I finished this in a matter of hours. An interesting look at the record industry.
1,ssssssslow and even slllllllower,"I loved Chocolate Star and I reread Chocolate Star before I read A Chocolate Affair.I just recently bought A Diamond Life and reread A Chocolate Star and A Chocolate Affair and after three years I must say I was excited to get back into these characters.However, after a week of reading A Chocolate Star and another two days of reading A Chocolate Affair, reading the first page of A Diamond Life was disappointing to say the least. I was expecting drama, drama and more drama.The main characters were the bread and butter and here I was reading saltine cracker material. I proceeded to place this book on my bookshelf and shake my head in disgust.In A Chocolate Affair there were some sections where I could sense Sheila was rushing things and/or tired. Overall that book was a 3.5. This Diamond Life, however, will be now be A Dusty Life as I can't muster the energy or waste anymore minutes of my life for naught."
2,Absolutely ridiculous.,"""Words can be talked into existence?"" lol, this book was extremely disapointing. These characters are absolutely maxed out and there was simply nowhere else for them to go. It read like a bad movie. Names of companies affecting real life, people with almost psychic power, the obligatory mother knowing a woman is pregnant by just being around her. And for the record it's spelled Hypnotiq."
1,"DVD ""Marie""","I paid for the DVD, paid postage, and return postage. about $30.00 for nothing.It was in a European aformat, which I discovered does not work on players made for North American use.Expensive lesson, but never again."
1,broke fast,"i have long hair, thin but thick because i have a lot of it. i have purchased the flatter me paddle brush by marilyn forever (ever since i saw it in some upscale salons) but stopped once the new design came out with the ivory grip handle. because the plastic is not strong through the padded handle, it quicky broke in two and i was left with a brush without a handle. if this was the old style of the brush (all brown not padded), i would give it 5 stars, however, this new style deserves zero stars .... however i have to rate it 1 star for amazon reviews."
2,Broke quickly,"I liked this brush upon first getting it, but after just a little over a year of use it's now snapped at the top of the handle, and even superglue won't bring it back to life. Also, fairly early in its use the little tips on the bristles fell off, making them slightly less comfy against my scalp. Suffice to say, next time I'll be spending my money on a brand I know."
5,Awesome paddle brush,"This is a terrific paddle brush - I searched for a while to find one comparable to my old one, and dare I say this one is better! Love it."
3,Good Book for Phrases,"Good book, but you need to be a little further along in your studies for this book. It is more of an advanced beginner to intermediate. The verb conjugations are for all tenses.It is a big help with overlapping verbs..It specifies with a greater clarity which verb is better to use."
3,Ok...,This book is helpful in that it shows many verbs in context. I didn't find some verbs that I thought should be there and they are a few mistakes but not too bad. It is good for practice.
2,Of Historical Significance Only,"This is a recording for the dedicated fan of Tippett's music or Sutherland's voice only. The sound quality is woefully poor (on the verge of unlistenable). Nevertheless, from an historical perspective it's good to gain some insight into the first performance of a major 20th century opera."
5,A GREAT GENIUS,Nat King Cole is One Of The Greatest Talents Ever.His Voice&Music are Timeless Treausures.His Work has Inspired Many.His Genius Continues Too Shine with Each Passing Year.Very Essential Material.
1,Press conference,"The author announced today (through her lawyer) that then entire book is a work of fiction and never actually occurred. She's stated that though she is not actually Jewish, while growing up she 'felt' Jewish. I'm not exactly sure what that means."
1,A complete fabrication,"This outrageous story is absolutely and utterly FALSE!!!! She did not treck 1900 miles across Europe, wasn't raised by wolves, and isn't even Jewish. The author completely made up the story, and is only recently on record recanting her story as completely false. After she's sold millions of copies. How convenient!!!! Don't waste your time, and if you've already bought it DEMAND YOUR MONEY BACK!!!"
2,Disappointing,"No answers to ""Worksheet"" pages. Answers would clarify the accuracy of the learning explained in the preceding chapter."
2,Not very Methodical,This book was ok but it doesn't really go into enough detail about one subject for the next to make sense. I would recommend using a more complete Theory like the Shoenberg A Theory of Harmony.
1,No answers makes this book problematic,"The information in this book is solid, but without answers, how can you check your progress? You cannot use it as a resource for scales, since you have to depend on your own work to be without flaws in order to trust it. The content is good... but other music theory books are a more complete package."
2,Broke,"So, I got the can opener a week and a half ago. I use it to open cans. And, after five uses, it broke. Just fell apart. I've never broken a can opener in my life, so this is pretty disappointing. Just a waste."
2,"Worked great for 3 weeks, then broken","to be honest, I used to open around 1 or 2 cans daily... After 3 weeks, it was broken when opening a small tuna box...I think if u use it with delicacy, it would live longer..."
4,Nice Jersey,It was a christmas gift for my 11 year old cousin who loves tiki. he was so excited with the present and has wore it every day since.
5,Exceptional aikido,"While no one is going to learn any martial art (much less one as subtle and precise as aikido) from a book, _Total Aikido_ is an exemplary companion volume to aikido study. It will enrich your knowledge and appreciation of this wonderful art."
4,Good as books go...,"There is always a problem learning any martial art from a book. No matter how good the pictures and explanation are, it doesn't translate well to the ""real"" world. This book does a little better than most. The pictures are good and the explanations are generally pretty clear. If you're looking for help in remembering what you're supposed to be learning, this book may help you. There are a couple of complaints I had, though I think they're fairly minor. First, some of the picture sequences were arranged oddly and I found this confusing. Once I worked it out, it was ok. Second, the names of the techniques are different than I've seen used by most other Aikido dojos. This was also easily overcome as the differences were pretty minor (ikkajo instead of ikkyo), but it was annoying in a niggling sort of way."
5,A perfect book for any child interested in the world!,"I bought this book for my 4 year old son, but my 8 year old loves it even more. It talks about the different games, food customs, cultures, appearances, languages and alphabets, holidays, etc. around the world. All of the information is presented in a joyful, non-dogmatic way. What a joy to read, to open any child's mind."
5,great book for multi-cultural curriculum,"What I like about this book is that it teaches at a preK/young elementary level that there are lots of different people in the world and everyone is worthy of respect, even those who do things differently than we do. We have a lot of differences and a lot in common too. A great discussion starter for children, and great for giving them a concept of the existence of different nationalities, customs, religions, and lifestyles around the world."
5,great book with great pics,"I really like this book. It has lots of different pictures, like 40 different noses, and 40 different ears. It is all about how people look different and that's okay. I got it as a gift for my newborn son because the gift-giver had it as a child himself and it was one of his favorites. I liked it so much I bought two more for gifts. Great pics. I am sure my son will enjoy it for a long time."
5,Learn AND celebrate our differences!,"""People"" is a book not just for children, but for adults also. Reading--rather--talking about the pictures in the book with your child or your co-worker is learning about how different our world is and how diversity is beautiful. It's fun to see how people from all over the world look, play, pray, dress and eat in different ways; sometimes in a very silly way--depending on which side you are. I have used the book for many years in my human rights education workshops and I will use it now with adults to do inter-cultural relations and communications workshops. This book belongs in every child, student, family, and human relations manager's bookshelf."
1,Caution advised,"Although I understand the praise this book receives, I'd like to issue a note of caution. In some cases, Spier has given us the exotic depictions of the cultural groups he presents. In many cases, that exotic view is outdated. In essence, he has frozen some cultural groups in days past. Unless a teacher or parent points this out, children may believe, for example, that today's Eskimo people (who prefer Inuit or Inupiat to ""Eskimo"") live in igloos, and that American Indians live in tepees. That is simply not true of these two groups. I wonder about others he's depicting. I hope teachers and parents point out these errors in presentation!"
5,A Wonderful Celebration of Human Diversity,"A beautiful, insightful look at cultural diversity across the world in people's appearance, habits, personalities, languages, religions, and other features, written for children but with an adult's keen perception of human nature. It is densely illustrated in Spier's inimitable style, which could provide hours of scrutiny and consideration by young readers. His incisive visual portrayal of the human experience gives far greater meaning to the descriptive text that accompanies the pictures. This is a wonderful celebration of the many lifestyles, cultures and personalities that represent humanity.One potential concern for parents: the book opens with a back view of Adam and Eve, unclothed, in the Garden of Eden. There is also one illustration of a tribal woman with no upper body covering. Two strategically placed stickers (or a judicious sharpie) could address these."
5,People is a book for adults & children alike,"Peter Spier has written many children books, and his book People (1980) is a fine example of the work Mr. Spier does. This book is for both children and adults. It helps us to realize the diversity and similarity of the peoples of the earth. It encourages questions and understandings. I highly recommend this book for children, parents, educators, administrators, and just people in general. Dr. Gabrielle M. Guedet, MFT"
3,Give It Away isn't on this because...,"that ""hit"" song was on Blood Sugar Sex Magik on Warner Bros. This CD is a comp of the earlier EMI years."
2,Where's the Holiday theme?,"I've been buying Playmobil advent sets for ten years or longer, and they've been a wonderful part of the holiday season for my grandchildren and me. We loved the various settings, and especially waited to see what Santa would be doing each year. ""Christmas in the Forest"" was truly special, as it included foxes -- my maiden name is Fox.The last two years have been terribly disappointing, however. Pirates and knights and unicorns and fairies may be good gender-specific toys, but -- except for the countdown feaure -- they have nothing to do with Advent. If and when Playmobil produces a Christmas-themed set, I'll return to buying them."
5,"absolutely loved it, can't wait to read it again","An awesome book. Written in an accessible, almost conversational, but also a very poetic style. Chavez explores a lot of feminine themes -- what does it mean to be a modern woman? how does that relate to familiar and cultural traditions? what role should our bodies and sexuality play in our vision of ourselves? should we stay connected to traditional maternal wisdom (an unmentioned mother goddess, I suppose)? Chavez also takes on the role of sociologist in rendering the Mexican-American community, it's people, culture, and problems. Overall an amazing book. I carried it with me day and night, stealing every moment I could to indulge in the pleasure of reading it."
4,A definite must read,"An absolutely hilarious journey. A great mixture of points of views, different narratives, different cultures and generations. So real I just couldn't put it down. Amazing insights into the life of a woman."
2,Face of an angel not so heavenly,"Though I was lead to believe this was an excellent novel, I was disappointed in the explicitly Chicana perspective that never rises above its roots to much of anything universal or enduring. The ""service"" theme is clever and the book can be endearing, even poetic at times, but overall, it's not worth the time. If you must, borrow it from a friend or get it from a library."
3,Good movie with ok plot,"If you like to watch Soumitra (like me), then you might like it.Otherwise, the plot and movie can't really stand itself."
4,so far so good,"Had this toaster for a couple months now and so far so good! toasts great - though one side usually comes out darker than the other. It's a fine toaster for the price, hoping it lasts."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER FOR TOASTING BAGELS!!,"With ALL the other toasters I have owned, the 'bagel' setting means that one side of the bagel remains untoasted, so that you just toast the cut sides. Not with this toaster. There's some blurb about the bagel button allowing the toaster to adjust toasting times, but the bottom line is that both sides are toasted - so with the wholewheat bagels I use, I have the choice between toasting the cut side while burning the other, or leaving the cut side just about warmed through before the other side burns.I've no doubt that if you want to toast bread, this is a perfectly adequate toaster. For bagels, it's just about useless, unless you like your bagels **extremely** lightly toasted. And yes, I DID have the 'bagels' button pressed in (and it was lit) throughout the process."
1,"worked great, for a month!!","I purchased the toaster on June 14. The toaster performed as expected until July 30th. I think we may have used it 10 or 12 times total. Suddenly one morning while the kids were at the table waiting for their waffles, the right side stopped working. unfortunately the Amazon return window expired on July 17. So now it's broken, and were stuck with it!"
1,Black Toast,"Love the looks of this toaster however it is extremely difficult to get it to toast at the right degree you want. Also, the knobs that you use to adjust the degree of toasting are most difficult to know where it is set. A good idea (which I did) was to color the small line with a marker that would not come off. Overall I am sorry that I purchased this toaster and wish I could return it and try another one."
3,ok,I picked this toaster so my young daughter could make toast without getting burned. She can pull up on the push button and the toast pops up higher from the hot surface. What is frusterating is the cord is short and off to the side so I have to have it sideways on the counter to plug it in. It looks and feels cheap but most stuff does these days.
1,Worst toaster I've ever owned!,"We put a man on the moon 4 decades ago - what's so frigging hard about making a toaster that works??? This toaster produces very inconsistent results. The adjustment knobs are purely decorational - they do nothing to control how dark or light my toast comes out. Sometimes I set it on the dark setting and my toast will pop up barely toasted. Other times I set it on light, walk away to do something, and I return to charred bread. Only one side's elements come on, regardless of whether or not I have the bagel button pushed in. I've always had good results with basic toasters until now. Sunbeam should be embarassed to have their name on this piece of junk."
1,Horrible!,This is a lesson to be careful what you order on Amazon. About 5 weeks after delivery this toaster broke -- one of the devices that lowers the bread to be toasted quit functioning. And now Amazon tells me it's too late to return. Nice. Out $25 + tax and the toaster is heading to the landfill.
4,Wonderful Waffles,"The toaster elements seem to only work on one side because they don't glow as red as the other side. Even so, the waffles turn out great! I was a bit concerned about buying a toaster online where a return might be a hassle, but because of the positive reviews I read, I decided to take the risk. We haven't tried bagels yet, but the frozen waffles and bread come out the way we like."
4,Hot! Toaster,"Everything I expected from a toaster. It has clean lines and not too big for a 4-slice toaster. I like the cancel and bagel buttons, as well as the lift function to get the slices out. Two faults I found were the darkness selector & the bagel button. The darkness setting is a scale from 1 - 7, where 2 is undercooked and 3 is burnt. There are additional marks between the 2 and 3 so as long as long as no one bumps the selector it toasts quite fine. The bagel button can be illuminated at the slightest touch, even if it isn't toasting."
2,Sunbeam toaster,"The second time I went to use this toaster, the slider on one side would not go down. It felt jammed with nothing in the toaster. Looking inside I could see that the guts of the toaster were off the track. I don't know how that happened. Working with a knife while the toaster was unplugged, I was eventually able to get the slider straightened out. It works now, but for how long I don't know. The darkness selector knobs have a poor indicator. I used permanent marker to darken the arrow so I would know where it was set. The electric cord comes out the side toward the front of the toaster. Seem like an odd location. Should come out toward the back where it is out of the way. I would not recommend this product."
1,This toaster will burn your bread!,"This is a horrible toaster. It burns toast and bagels on the third setting (out of 10!) I hate to think what would happen if I pushed the setting past 4. Settings 1 and 2 do not cook the toast completely in one cycle so you have to stand there and watch it. BUT if you use the third setting, you still have to watch it because it will burn. IF you check your toast mid-cycle, DO NOT walk away! This toaster has no sensors and operates on timers of some sort so if you put a half done piece back in, it will sit for another complete cycle and come out black as coal."
5,SUPERB!,"Who cares if the toast is not done quite so much on one side?? Life is too short to concentrate so much attention to things like that! People, the thing is, the toaster works just fine! And it does so as it says it will...time after time, and for this price can we please drop the petty complaints! I am even impressed by the bagel feature, which I thought would be a bogus add-on, but mine functioned perfectly. (Use this setting for English muffins, by the way). All in all, 5 stars for being what it says it is, usability, ease of maintenance, and product functionality. HIGHLY recommended."
1,Defective,"Used this toaster for only the 2nd or 3rd time. About 10 seconds after starting the toast, it popped loudly and started smoking. I was able to unplug it before it burned down the house. I am extremely glad I hadn't left the room."
5,Tastes as good as the refrigerated brands,"We like the fact that the product isn't refrigerated and therefore a longer shelf life. Also, the product quantity is perfect for various meal options (we use the whole package and not have to worry about saving)."
1,This is not extra firm,"This is not extra firm. It is absolutely very soft. It is a waste since I can not return it, I will have to discard it. It is a total miss representation of a product. I am very disappointed. I would like to know why can It be returned. I use one box and have no intention to touch the others."
2,"Bear in mind the ""silken"" part of the product title...","For my purposes, this tofu just doesn't work. I like to drain my tofu, slice it, marinate it, and then bake it (for use as part of a stir-fry.) This particular type of tofu, however, is true to the ""silken"" variety. If I were using it as part of a recipe that didn't require firmness as part of the equation, I'm sure it would be fine. However, you have to be EXTRA cautious when handling the tofu because it is ""silken"" (and therefore a ton more fragile.) In addition, if baked, it produces a very unappetizing, rubbery texture. I didn't hate it, but I definitely won't be buying it again."
5,Hard to find locally!,"There are so many kinds of tofu and my local Whole Foods doesn't carry them all, like for instance they carry Silken Firm but not Silken Extra Firm. In a pinch most recipes that call for Extra Firm can take Firm instead, but it's so convenient to buy a case from Amazon and it's about the same price so might as well get the exact right kind. If you're looking for ways to use up your Silken Extra Firm tofu, try the blog of Bryanna Clark Grogan, which contains a fabulous recipe for vegan Boursin style cheese spread and a bunch of other stuff, or try some of her cookbooks here on Amazon. Being obsessed with Bryanna's recipes is really why my bf and I went through a case and a half of extra firm silken tofu in just a few months and every recipe of hers we've tried is fabulous."
2,Mostly Underwhelming,"It was amusing at times, but often more sophomoric than anything else. I'm just glad it didn't take too long to read...."
1,Read/Buy David Sedaris instead,"I typically enjoy this type of book, ie: short stories/essays, black humor, satire, etc, however I found this to be extremely unfunny. I purchase a lot of authors I've never heard of (Todd Allen, for example) as a result of the reviews on this site. Big mistake purchasing and reading this book. It wasn't necessarily bad, just not funny. If you're looking for humor, short essays, etc, try David Sedaris or Henry Alford. Both hysterical."
4,Change of Pace,"I got interested in his novels from the Swedish Wallendar series on Netflix ( not the British version, which I heard was also very good). Can be a little slow but it a pleasant change of pace from our American stuff that has gotten lost at times in the need to provide ""sex, drugs and rock-and-roll."" I also like the insight into another culture's way of life and values. When I first read, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo, I assumed Sweden's biggest problem was having too many beautiful blonds. I was clueless about their Skin Heads and Neo Nazis left over form WWII. A similar joy in this area was reading ""Out Stealing Horses"" that showed how the average citizen might have been impacted by WWII when growing up . . . not just the tank battles, etc. that Americans like to see."
2,A so-so book,"I found this book being given away and figured I'd read it based upon the glowing reader reviews on Amazon.com and the CWA Gold Dagger award for this book. I'm sorry that I read it. It's a decent book, but not great. It was not worth my time. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialogue is flat, and it wasn't much of a page-turner. Basically, it's an unexciting book that leaves you on a down -- kind of like the Swedish personality in general -- which is a theme of the book itself. While I'm not a mystery-book junkie, I'm open to the genre. If this book constitutes an award winner, then I'm hesitant to read much else in this genre that is celebrated by the ""experts."""
4,Up there,"I read a lot of crime novels and find Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander books up there with some of my favorites, such as Ross MacDonald, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Jim Thompson, James M. Cain. Mankell's style is different from my favorites, but his books are equally engrossing.Dangerous Times"
2,Not sure what the fuss is about,"Frankly, I just don't see it. There are two major problems with this book: the first is that you know who the killer is pretty much at the outset, and that drains most of the suspense from the book. That leads to the second problem: the police officer at the center of the novel is, it seems to me, not very good. He misses a lot of obvious stuff. Oddly, where the novel covers a lot of the everyday details of the man's life during the investigation (lack of sleep, spilling ink on his shirt), it gives short shrift to the actual investigation. (For instance, it isn't clear that the police bothered to interview the neighbors of a murder victim until much later). The detective comes off as not very bright, and that's not what you want in a mystery. I was happy to end the book."
5,Sidetracked: A Kurt Wallender Mystery,I chose this series because a West Point classmate of mine recommended it. I like this type of detective series with characters that seem real with their own challenges and weaknesses. I also appreciate the opportunity to get a feel for Sweden and its people.
5,Another Good One,Lets be frank. I'm a big fan of the Kurt Wallander series and rate it at the top when it comes to mysteries. This story is simply another in a reasonably long line of successful offerings from Mr. Mankell and is a worthy read for existing fans or those who like cerebral mysteries and haven't yet had the pleasure of making Mr. Wallander's acquaintance. Those in the know will read this automatically so who cares what the story is about. There's not a bad book in the bunch.
5,Loved the narrator as well as the book,"Saw so many comments from those who felt very strongly that the narrator ruined the book that I almost didn't purchase it. So glad I did because I felt the narrator added to the book - certainly the author thought so as well.Perhaps those who didn't like the narrator are those who do not want to taste the experience of the story. For instance, those people would also hate Maya Angelou's rich voice, with her slow cadence and enunciated words. When I read a book, I read much faster, but when I LISTEN to an audiobook, I want the atmosphere and the nuances that I may miss with a quick read. My only complaint may be that it ended too abruptly - would've preferred a couple more chapters to flesh out a couple story threads. A great book - I've already downloaded two more of Mankell's."
4,Wallendar at his best,"I had a hard time putting down this book. I've read five of the books and this one has the tightest plot. The girl who commits suicide by burning herself up in a rapeseed field catches your attention at the beginning and Mankell pulls you along with murders, revelations and suspense until the very end. In his personal life, Wallander has to deal with a long distance girlfriend, the World Cup, a father who has Alzheimer's and a distant daughter. Mankell makes decaying Swedish society a character in the plot. There's a melancholy tone in the novel that fits in well with Wallander's ambivalence to his job.The translation is good, but quirky. The book is a good read."
1,Only 3 minutes interesting,"Bad singers (except maybe Luna ; the worst being Manrico). Bad conductor. The only interest : the additional three minutes of the finale, more dramatic.--------Cette version chantée par de petites pointures qui remplissent à peine le contrat a pour seul intért l'air final dit finale franais (bien que traduit en italien). Plus long de trois minutes que le finale habituel, il est plus progressif et donc plus dramatique. Est-ce suffisant pour acheter le disque ?"
1,Derivative.,A book which reminds me of one of those trendy coffee shops which have sprung up all over the place - trendy decor and dreadful coffee. A book which seems to say look at how clever I am.
2,Overrrated,"I was interested in this book for a variety of reasons ... it won the rooney prize and wheatley is known as a vicious reviewer in Ireland. I don't write poetry, but I like to read it. But really I thought this were very careful, safe lyrics ... nothing exceptional, no insights, I wouldn't like to say what wheatley would say if he were reviewing the book with his own standards ...overall the arc of the book is a little unispiring too ... a couple of translations which do nothing but prove how what? erudite the poet is supposed to be ..."
4,Disappointed,This is the product I ordered but it is not the product I recieved. I chose this product because of my prior history with it and was satisfied completely with it.
2,Boring,"After finishing the Myst series, I was looking for another puzzle-type game and got this one. The puzzles in this game encourage random clicking, a sort of exhaustive search of every possible combination of inventory item with every interactive character. That's dumb -- I bought a puzzle game so that I could use my brain! Also, the scenes plod along with weak attempts at humor and character development. Pretty disappointing."
4,Pretty good cd,The whole cd is really good.You just have to give it a chance.Stone gossard works well with the rest of the band and has some seriously good songs.Its not quite as good as Stone's solo debut BayLeaf but not that far off
5,I love this CD!,"I love this CD. I have listened to track 2, The Day Brings, so many times, it's getting worn out. This is one of my all time favorites. I always have it with me in the car. I just never get tired of listening to it. If you don't own it, you should."
2,"No, this ain't that good..","I just get so annoyed by the singer's voice. All the songs are just too boring, repeating choruses that in the end just seems to fill out the songs. Yeah, that's how I feel. I just bought the cd cause Stone Gossard was in the band. And I do believe I'd like it more if he was the singer. He's got a nice voice.."
5,Brad is an addictive drug.,"Brad is a surprisingly unknown but, excellent band. If this cd, was ever somehow promoted more, it would go platinum, easily."
4,Stone Gossard's side project delivers memorable record.,"""Interiors"" features some excellent songs. The first four tracks are simply outstanding. Its tough to top the driving rocker that leads off. ""Secret Girl"" was probably my favorite song of '97 - it gets you going! Brad combines that Gossard groove with the soulful vocals and piano work of Shaun ----? They can slow it down too. Highly reccommended!"
5,Brad at It's Finest,"Highly recommended for fans of Brad that are yet to hear this album.The entire album is great, but major highlights for me include:Secret GirlThe Day BringsLiftSweet Al GeorgeCircle & LineCandles"
4,another round please,"this is an album that grows on you..like a fungus. you feel it on you but you can't shake it off. Smile, close your eyes and let songs like 'upon my shoulders' and funeral song take you away. Sometimes gloomy, sometimes upbeat, always slick."
1,low quality,"These are really pretty earrings, but the first time I put them on the post snapped in half. I was planning to wear them at my wedding, but had to return them. No hassels when I returned them."
4,Nice pair of earrings.,"I was looking for a pair of silver earrings with my birth stone, saphire, and I found these. I love them. They are the right size and they look really nice on. Thanks Amazon."
3,Beautiful and painful,"The earrings are gorgeous and well made. Unfortunately, the part that goes through the ear huts mine terribly. It's flat, not a round post. And it's ""taller"" than a typical post earring wire's diameter. I was in pain putting them in, left them in for a day, and was in even more pain taking them out. I'd love these if they'd just redesign the post part so it is not as tall and thinner overall. Looking carefully at the side view, I can now see this detail, which I didn't catch before ordering.If you have larger holes in your ears and are not sensitive to post diameters, you'll be fine. But my holes have little give and these hurt unfortunately."
5,"A Thoughtful, Inspiring, and Unique Work",I thoroughly enjoyed The Necessity of Empty Places. It's vivid desciptions of the praririelands of the US and it's thought provoking insights into the relationship that humans have with their environment make the book a satisfying page-turner. Bits of humor and humility keep the book fun and refreshing
1,Defective Product,Cable worked for a few days before it got a loose contact. Not worth returning due to the cheap price.
4,Does its job well,"Is exactly what it says it is, and cheap. Picture quality is just fine - no real noticeable difference between this cable and the Monster Cable I've got on the other component."
4,"Very good build quality, works well","These work exactly as expected - the quality of my DVD playback went up considerably. I really haven't compared to other brands, say, Monster, but according to other reviews, these work just as well. One difference from other cables may be that these are not gold plated (and to be fair, the manufacturer does not claim they are), so if you are looking for specifically gold plated cables, these are not for you. But in every other sense, these are very good value for money."
1,"Beware, item is not Philips brand","I purchased this item and recieved the CMPLE brand 318-N component cable. I purposely wanted the Philips brand cable as advertised and did not get it. I contacted seller and recieved a lame email stating that the item description may have changed and they have no control over that, so I could return the cables. The cables they did send seem to be OK and useable, but when you order a specific product you expect to recieve that product."
1,I bought this Philips Ph61071 5 feet componenet-video cable from ELMENOS,"Bought this cable strickly from good review, turn out to be bad quality made, dead on arrival. The cost is notvery much and they do accept return, but it cost more in shipping to return then to just throwaway the cable.So buyer beware."
2,A good test cable,I use this as a test cable for componet video signals. It shows a great picture with no signs of video loss at all.
4,works 4 me!!,"I brought these philips cables to go with a new tv set; and put the old red, white and yellow component cables on an older tv. The video cables work, look great and arrived ontime!"
5,"Works great, cheap, below average shipping rate","Everything was great with this product except for the shipping. I purchased this the same time I bought an upconverting DVD player from ebay. I paid for standard shipping on these cables and got the DVD player with free shipping. The DVD player came in 2 days before these cables, which was anti-climatic. When I put them together, they worked great. Cheap price, great product, average shipping. Still were a great value."
3,"Works, but limitedly","Works on my older Sony DVD player, but does not work on either of my Cyber Home DVD player or recorder. I don't know if this is a problem with the Cyber Home (a real possibility) or with the cables themselves."
2,"Not as good as other, higher priced, cables","I bought these cheaper cables thinking that all that talk about gold plated terminals, silver content solder, etc. found on other cables was just a way of justifying a higher price. But when I compared the performance of these Phillips cables with Monster THX 500 cables (bought at Radio Shack) and Radio Shack brand cables using my (non digital, low def) Panasonic DVD recorder/player I found that the Phillips cables gave the least bright, least colored, image of the bunch. The monster cables were clearly the best. I would have saved some money by adjusting the TV settings if it were only a matter of color saturation, but I figured ramping up the backlight setting to the max to compensate for the dim image probably wouldn't be that good for the tv.Funnily enough, when I did the same test with an older Panasonic DVD player, the original composite cable gave the best image. Go figure."
1,waste of time,"Although the price is attractive, this product, at least the one I got, didn't work for me at all. I was trying to connect my media PC to my plasma, images appear to be blurry, almost like they are out-of-focus. Returned it the next day.Amazon service is great, return is really hassle-free."
1,Blue Screen!,"I've just purchased these cables, guiding myself on the good reviews. I set up the dvd and tv and to my surprise the movie looks blue!, i feel like i'm watching the smurfs. If I try different combinations I get black and white, red and blue. I connected the cables correctly so I don't know if my cables are defective or whats the problem. And thanks for robinw who pointed out the problem:robinwI've experienced this problem before. It's actually caused by the DVD player, not the cable. By changing your DVD player's output into ""Component output"" (it's somewhere hidden in your DVD player's menu) should solve this problem"
3,Pray for the Soul of Betty,This CD reminds me of Black Sabbath. A little hard for my taste. But Constantine has potential.
5,Awesome!!,I bought Pray for the Soul of Betty (clean version) for my daughter who loves Contantine. It is a great CD!!!!
5,"Full course on lighting, in a book...","This book is packed with information. In a clear, concise and entertaining manner Nick untangles the mystery of the art of lighting. I love the balance of the theoretical with the practical. You not only learn how to light a scene better, but you learn why you do it that way, and that, in the long run, is what is needed. I think that this book is not only a great resource for the Lightwave enthusiast, but would be a great benefit for any 3d user."
4,Wrong language done right.,"Don't let the wrong language deter you from this recording. The sound shows its age a bit, but the performance is vital and impressive. Lorenz Fehenberger (my favorite Lohengrin) is Riccardo and sings it brilliantly, with grace and passion. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is Renato, and he convinces that his ""wrong"" voice is actually correct. You may not know Anny Schlemm, but that is your loss. She is fabulous as Amelia. Fritz Busch holds the whole thing together, the recording made near the end of his life. His attention to orchestral details and to shaping each scene show in number after number. A great recording not to be missed."
4,4 wonders for Ariadne,"4 wonders = della Casa, Seefried, Gueden, Streich, four supreme straussians barely distributed in the same opera. However this recording is not as perfect as it should. Technically there have been better recording from the fifties even monaural. Boehm's direction is exceptionally good with a real feeling for the theater and this opera in particular. Seefried is really outstanding and cannot be bettered in this role. Gueden is charming but the very high top notes are maybe a little bit too high for her! Streich could have replaced her but on live, her voice lacks some volume. Della Casa has given a better interpretation in studio (Decca and Testament both highly recommendable), here the voice is sometimes shrill without the fabulous tone she normally has. Schock is as good as in the studio version with Karajan. A very good evening indeed but not a reference!"
3,Expensive roller,"Ordered this product, took a full week to receive. It is a nice roller, but not as dense or hard as I thought it would be due to the reviews and high cost. Would recommend buying one that comes with tips on how to use a roller/ buy a denser roller. Hopefully it will help the hurt knee! Consider buying one of smaller size too if you are tight on space."
1,A big piece of styrofoam,"I don't know if this is what the product is supposed to be ... but it's just a huge chunk of extruded styrofoam. Try using it to roll around and you'll bruise yourself. Would not recommend at all. Luckily, the vendor replaced my money."
5,Chiropractor noticed improvement,"After reading other reviews I decided on this roller. And I'm glad I did. It has lived up to all my expectations and is holding up well. It's great for sore muscles and helping keep my spine aligned. I'm on a maintenance schedule whereby I get chiropractic adjustments every six weeks. I bought this roller about a week after my January appointment and have been using it almost daily. At my last appointment (about a month after buying the roller) my chiropractor commented that I needed less manipulation than usual and things went back into place easier than in the past. Not only do I feel better, but my chiropractor has noticed an improvement as well."
5,"Sore muscles, begone!","A great foam roller for any athlete. Helps relieve muscle tension and soreness. In hindsight I could have worked with a shorter one, but it's a good density to be effective, but not so hard as to bruise."
4,Good Product,"I like the foam roller. Trouble was, I couldn't get the educational DVD to open on my Mac or a DVD player. Never tried it in a PC."
5,Solid,"I've spent more hours on this than I can count. It has a little dip now, but c'mon I've been laying into this thing for months now. It's a good buy, guaranteed."
3,Foam Roller,"The roller was a little harder than I expected. It is effective and will probably ""hold up"" for the entire family to use, but I wish it had been a little softer."
1,Not round!,"This foam roller had a flat side on it straight out of the box, which made it useless for rolling out muscles. I returned it for another brand."
1,HARD AS A ROCK - ITS LIKE ROLLING ON A BASEBALL BAT,I have another smaller roller and it is way more comfortable. I strongly discourage anyone from buying this... unless you love pain.
5,essential,This has become an essential tool for my pre and post workouts. Great for stretching my IT band. Can be used for so many different stretches. Used almost daily.
3,PT Exercise,The roller was too firm for someone who has a small frame. May be better for a larger or heavier person.
5,Has been a HUGH help!!!,"I have had the PB Elite foam roller for about 3 weeks and it has worked wonders for my tight IT bands! I have tried all kinds of stretching and nothing seem to work and always had knee pain. After just a few days of using the roller I have seen significant improvement. It did HURT tremendously at first, but it is much better now and I do my roller exercises every day. I can use the stairs pain free, ride my bike, and next step is to try running again. I highly recommend using a foam roller if you have IT Band problems."
5,Stable and Firm,"This foam roller is an excellent buy. I bought the largest full round and have already used it to massage my muscles and to perform some stretches. The foam is really dense, so the roller keeps its shape. My trainer has one and he has a variety of people of differing weights using it - and it looks brand new! The quality is super! Perform Better also includes an exercise sheet with advice on how to get the most out of your purchase.Perform Better is an excellent company and sent it out right away. I had it within a couple of days after ordering. They also give you reliable tracking information. One other thing they did that was fabulous was that they emailed me a copy of the invoice. They are a top notch company! Buy with confidence - both the quality of the product and company are excellent."
5,can't live without it,This product was recommended to me by my physiotherapist & on another occasion by my chiropractor to help alleviate neck & back pain & aligning the spine.It is an amazing tool for full body stretching. It is also hard enough & of good quality. There are lots of them at my gym but having one at home is great for stretching morning & evening.I would highly recommend getting a video or watching a few You tube exercises.I purchased a booklet from Amazon but had to return it because it was black & white inside & very difficult to see the images of the exercises due to poor printing quality. It was also not spiral bound which makes it tough to follow as you go from one exercise to the next.
3,Diamonds - not a girl's best friend?,"Tracie Lords plays a diamond thief who gets chased by gangsters and mafia trying to get her 60 million in diamonds. Her man gets killed and her ""ice"" gets taken. So she gets revenge. Bang! Bang!"
5,Just superb,"In 20 years of fitness and martial arts training, this is the single best training product I have ever encountered. It did all it claimed to do and more. Freedom from pain and old injuries. New flexibility and flow. Increased tendon strength and resilience. And an improved general sense of health and well-being. All presented in an easy-to-follow format, that lets you progress at your own rate.Buy this. Now. You will not regret it."
4,Powerful worship CD,"I really enjoyed this CD (along with all the other Passion albums). Although I graduated from college over a decade ago, I truly appreciate the style of worship music that this CD represents. I think this style is much more contemporary and powerful than many recent Christian CDs.This album has some very popular modern Christian worship songs like ""I could sing of your love forever"", ""Did you feel the mountains tremble"", and ""Every move I make"". But it also includes some other songs like ""You alone"", ""Sweet Mercies"" and ""The Vision"" which are just as inspiring.I recommend this CD to anyone looking for powerful modern Christian worship. I also encourage older Christians (like myself) to buy the album and give it a listen. It may give you some fresh inspiration for your worship. I know it has mine."
4,Du Sud Au Nord,"Wonderful blend of pop rock influence and middle eastern music, it is one of the early examples of the potent wave of world music that has now come into its own."
3,A good airplane read but pedestrian.,"1920s. Esko fights the Bolsheviks in Finland before fleeing to the USA to be a skyscraper architect. 2 stories fused together with little to link them. Well sketched characters, except for the principal love interest. Historical color. Good pace. Easy to read."
3,good but somewhat disappointing,"I hoped this book would meet the expectations I had when I began it (and promised by the jacket when I saw it in a bookstore)--but alas, it was really somewhat disappointing ....as another reviewer stated, it too closely resembles The Fountainhead and the people --are sort of Ludlumian in that they are larger than life and too heroic to be believable -- the primary love relationship stretches credibility and the author relies too often on ironic and unexpected appearances of the main characters for somewhat contrived dramatic effect. There is some interesting ""history""as far as the Finnish Civil War ..but I found it a seriously flawed book."
2,Eh. Interesting but derivative.,"I was interested in seeing how it would turn out. However, I wasn't riveted. The whole time I was reading it I was thinking it was so much like The Fountainhead- a determined and visionary modern architect with the world against him (who even works in construction in the beginning), an aloof and unattainable female character who loves the architect but can't let herself have him, an older architect mentor who was down on his luck because no one would hire him anymore, a wealthy patron who sponsors a building and who the architect likes despite being in love with the patron's wife...Raynor's characters end up a little flat and it becomes harder to understand why they are doing what they do. if the Fountainhead is too much for you, this book is for you. Otherwise, stick with the original."
5,I KNEW SHE STILL HAD IT,"SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS IS A GUTSY, THROATY, SOUL BARING SIDE OF WYNONNA THAT WE HAVE'NT SEEN SINCE ""THAT WAS YESTERDAY"". THIS SONG SEEMS WRITTEN WITH HER IN MIND WITH HER AWSOME VOCAL RANGE. WHAT A WONDERFUL KICK-OFF FOR HER NEW ALBUM. GROOVE ON WYNONNA!"
1,Terrible trash,"""Renegade"" is one of the worst tv series I've ever seen, with terrible writing and very low, low budget. Forget it."
1,"Good God, man",What an embarassment. I knew D. Victor when he was a bad writer. But this shows that there is no bottom for a true hack. Pass on this one.
5,Renegade is fun.,Renegade is a fun show to watch. Predictable. Seeing Cannell as actor also interesting. Also seeing actors who went on to bigger things and actors you recognize from the past (but have no names for). Lamas has a different look from dad and that adds to the show. The price on the two season set was excellent.
5,Renegade seansons 2 and 3,"Execlent DVDs my wife and I both are really enjoying watching them , we are both 55 years old , if you like action packed shows with a good story not just a shootem up . you will love this ..Steve and Janice"
5,Renegades back,I got this dvd set because I remembered enjoying watching this series when it was popular.The dvds picture quality is good and it has all of the first seasons episodes.Being a bike lover I liked the concept of a bounty hunter on a bike. Lorenzo Lamas seems to fit the part and Kathleen Kinmont provides the scenery.If you're a Renegade fan you'll like this dvd set.
1,Way to go Amazon...,"Ordered this download for this particular (""Bonnie and Claire"") episode...got another episode ""Endless Summer"" instead. Not good. Thought I would order the Renagade ""Endless Summer"" and hopefully get what I wanted, i.e. The ""Bonnie and Claire"" episode. Got that download, which takes forever to download btw, and I've got DSL. Anyone with dial-up had better give it a week or so, to download. When I tried to play that, my pc would freeze up tight, each time, every time.The Unbox video player, which you have to install, because windows/quicktime or real is too good or something; plays so so at best.(Unbox, which I now think stands for ""Un-usable Box"", perhaps.)Long story short, I uninstalled the thing and kicked it to the curb. Couldn't find any reasonable place to hope for a refund on the site for bad/incorrect downloads, so they get my less than flattering review, instead. Toodles."
5,Awesome,Finally found this on Amazon great that I found it. Not to bad on the price i've seen this sell for more at truck stops.
2,Renegade season 1 episode 5 (Instant video),One the file is downloaded to your computer using unbox the quality is crap and the video is cropped. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Good show....Horibile product,"Every single item I own from Mill Creek Entertainment has problems, frezzing, neon green pixles, skipping..ect. I own several (this will be my last item I buy from Mill Creek Entertainment). Amazon is listing two diffrent versions of Renegade, do not go the cheap route and buy the Mill Creek one, your just buying problems, even if you buy new."
1,Why re-release Season 1???,Why on earth would Millcreek re-release Season 1? Any Renegade fan has 1 2 and 3 Seasons.. We all need Season's 4 and 5!!I think this is a waste.. Don't hold your breath people.. they will do just like Anchor Bay did.. They will see how the first 3 seasons will sell and ditch the rest.Come on Millcreek.. WAKE UP!! SEASON 4 AND 5 IN A BOX SET.. DONE.Well MillCreek will release all 5 season's October 2010... Box set...Im glad I have all 5 seasons already!!!!
5,The Basket of Flowers,I have read the Basket of Flowers four times and each time I feel the same way. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. I would recommend this book to teenagers and adult. Great book.
3,"For younger readers, in my opinion","I like a lot of the Christian novels from this era, but this book, though it grabbed me at the beginning (enough that I downloaded it), was, as the author declared more than once, written for young people, and I agree. Some books written for the young are just as rich for adults, but, for me, not this one."
2,Have not read yet,Purhased for a Spring 2013 quarter seminary class. Have not had an opportunity to read this book yet. Will know more after the class is over.
5,Best Norma,"Norma is an opera that demands great breath control, a flawless coloratura technique, and a secure high soprano of remarkable beauty. Only one diva comes to mind, and it is the great Joan Sutherland. Absolutely no one can touch her here, and I dare anyone to prove that anyone has approached dame Joan's stupendous prowness here. I have the Sutherland/Horne set, and this one also, believe it or not, I like this one better, and why not?"
5,Beautiful,I don't know what the other person who is reviewing this cd is listening to when he said that this Norma is not as good as Sutherland's earlier set. I think this Norma is actually Dame Joan's best. Perfect singing indeed. Sutherland has became my favorite singer. Buy this set!
2,Cold Bel Canto,"Some gifted souls are born to BE Norma. Others just sing Norma. Ponselle, Callas, Caballé--great Normas. Sutherland: an efficient singer who ends up leaving the listener cold and uninvolved. Bonynge's conducting is simply boring--but then, he was part of the team. The most interesting and involved singers are John Alexander and especially Huguette Tourangeau. Callas reigns supreme in this repertory; and watch Caballé with John Vickers on DVD! By the way, my favorite Sutherland: Lakmé, Esclarmonde."
2,A disappointing Norma,"Sutherland was awesome as Norma during the 60's and 70's. Unfortunately, this Norma was recorded much later. The voice has lost a lot of the beauty of tone, but her technique still amazing. For a much better Norma, look for the 1964 recording with Sutherland and Horne in the absolute best of form, which is to say, probably the best bel-canto duo of our time."
2,Serious disappointment,"It's doubtful that a large voice capable of singing fiorature with strict 'a tempo' technical fireworks --- albeit with contrasting slower, 'expressive' sections --- is sufficient in itself to create a convincing Norma. With 111 performances under her belt, at least this performance of Sutherland fails to convince me that she understands Norma's predicament and can relay in 'musical' (dare I say, 'artistic')terms. Lurching between the turgid and rather graceless 'Casta Diva' to the bullet-like precision of ""Bella a me ritorna"" is not very eloquent (Bartoli does this sort of thing with greater flair). With a conventionally 'uglier' voice, Callas is still to be preferred. Perhaps Sills as well (haven't heard her, but she consistently understands what she's singing)...Deutekom in Vienna was more vital, while Caballe comes closest to the ideal combination of feeling, technique, and 'bella voce'. All-in-all, uninteresting as art, except perhaps to fanciers of large canaries."
1,Misleading description,There is nothing to review as the document is just a outline of what the book contains. I wouldn't be so disappointed if the title had specified this.The three sentence review itself was not very helpful.
5,Delivers what it promises,"Let's be realistic--twenty bucks and a 30-minute video won't make you an instant Spanish whiz. What it will do is give you the basics you need to make your vacation a bit easier, rewarding and yes, fun. That's it, nothing else. And that's exactly what the video promises. The attempt by a visitor to communicate, no matter how basic, in the native language of a country, is always very much appreciated. And for those visiting Spanish-speaking ports of call, ""Cerveza Fria"" is a great way to begin."
2,Disappointing!,"Perhaps this presentation was a hit on Caribbean cruise ships, but I was hoping for something more. Too much of his brief time was spent reviewing things we already knew. I probably would have more profitably spent my 30 minutes watching Dora the Explorer."
1,damn this sucks,"I ordered this as a gift for my brother-in-law who really wants to learn Spanish. It sounded like it'd be a fun video but it was really lame. I'm so glad I watched it before giving it to him because I would've been really embarrassed if I gave this to him. The presentation is this guy talking and the words show up on the screen. About half the video is just advice on language learning, and it was pretty common knowledge stuff at that. I should've used my common sense when I read the description of the video before I bought it, because it literally is, all the Spanish you'll need for a vacation. como esta, cerveza, and gracias...... it doesn't get any more advanced than that. Geez what a waste of money."
5,Sutherland is DIVA,"Sutherland is the main reason to buy this set. I'm her biggest fan after only a few months I've already bought over a thousand dollars in cd's, almost all in her name. She is just a gift from God. And even though I'm too young to have heard her LIVE, I'm indeed lucky that there are so many wonderful recordings around. This is one of them. The coloratura is spellbinding. She is truly the master singer of our time. Please buy this recording, you will not be sorry. As for the tenor, he is quite good too, maybe better than Pavorotti. The recorded sound really isn't so bad. My recording of Callas's Tosca is far worst. And the music is very lovely. BUY THIS!!!!!!"
1,"LIVE RECORDING, VERY BAD SOUND, PEOPLE making noices,etc","The singer are all very good and they are in top condition, but the LIVE recording is thecnicaly so BAD that you can not enjoy it at all. People making noices in the theater all the time, etc. I will NEVER by anything that is like this. I started listening and I had to put it aside and I will never will play it again....!!!"
2,Sutherland's voice,"Sutherland's voice was probably larger in amplitude than Nilsson's voice, but Nilsson's voice was the louder of the two."
3,Close but No Cigar,"Sutherland, Simionato, Ghiaurov, and Tozzi (not to mention the ubiquitous Piero de Palma) are splendid. Corelli makes some really wonderful sounds but with precious little musicianship. He is not helped, it must be said, by the slashing of the score compared with the original; much of the original first act is cut, leaving Cossotto, who is wonderful in what is left, with precious little to do. The conducting is a little stodgy. The sound is comparable to the Met broadcasts of the same era, though the La Scala acoustics have never recorded well, in my opinion."
2,Not worth it,"I read all of these reviews and thought this record it was something it was not. As another reviewer said- there are no high Ds or D flats from Corelli (adjust your record players guys!) and I only hear one or maybe two Cs. His voice his superb of course- glorious, magnificent, almost unique tone, and fabulous uppper register, but there are better Corelli records out there if you want to hear these thrills and really, apart from the duet which is haunting, the CD is not such a thrill. Sutherland does sing really well (but who said her voice was as big as Nilssons? how could it possibly be like this? it is a colloratura and nothing like Nilsson's!!!). The music is pretty hammy and sounds like it is cut all over the place. If you want to hear truly great LA Scala performances try Otello with Kleiber(1976- best record I have got) or Forza del Destino (1978) with Caballe' and Carreras. Only buy this one if you are a real Corelli fan."
3,TASTELESS!,"Both Corelli and Sutherland have no business singing French opera. IMHO it's DREADFUL! And I never said anything about verismo. BTW: Spell it right, it's not versimio but VERISMO. I have re-added two stars for Sutherlands technical finish. And that's about it. True, the passion and ardour is superb, but this ain't Donizetti. (Despite the superb coloratura and topnotes) For a better recording of this opera (In the original language) get this recording (Also with Joanie) ...has to be IDIOMATIC too, guys."
4,Fabulous,"This is a great recording. I must say I am young, but my knowledge of opera is great and i know good singing when I hear it. Franco Corelli is my favorite tenor. Though, however great his singing is, i am not going to be biased, he left out most of the difficult music. He edited a great deal from the tenor part. Though, what he does sing is the greatest display of pure masculine testoternone driven tenor singing ever displayed. Sutherland had one of the greatest instruments of the century. Although you cannot understand anything she says, which is not acceptable to me personally, her instrument is gold. However, the greatest singing on this recording is Simionato, her heavy mezzo is to me the greatest ever and she displays it perfectly here. If you are a fan of the old shcool singers you will have to learn to deal with bad recording quality. If the singing is good enough it all seems to disapear anyhow."
1,Very Misleading,"Like everyone else who bought this, it seemed like a great idea. Upon getting it home and using it though, it was useless. When I read the fine print on the box, it says it will only hold 24 if there is only 4 ozs in each bag. I assume they just want you to squish them on top of each other, which is just annoying.I, too, went back and bought a $1.99 ice cube storage bin which is the perfect size, and actually makes rotating th oldest easier, you just add to the back, unlike this product, where you would either have to put a marker in, constantly move each bag forward into a new compartment, or pick each one up and look at the date."
1,"Great idea, but lacks in research","Everything everyone else said PLUS:Previously frozen packs cannot be put into the compartemnts as they didn't freeze in the proper shape.And yes, rotating is a pain."
1,as said before.....,"As said above, this product is useless. To add though, i dont understand how you ""stack"" them when you have to pull the bottom out (the support). It just makes everything topple. Wish i had spent my money on other things!"
3,Served it's purpose,"I agree with other reviewers that you can't store very much in these but I liked to use them to store the fresh milk while it was freezing. Then when the container got full I would move the milk into gallon storage bags organized by date. Any way you look at it milk takes up alot of freezer space, this was just a good spot for me to put my freshest milk for freezing."
1,glad i read the reviews first,"when i first seen this product at toysrus i knew i had to add it to my online registery. i'm glad i read the reviews first...thanks to all who actully put their thoughts on here, saved me the hassle, and gave me ideas. THANKS"
2,"Broken, not packaged well","The fiestaware is nice of course, but the item was not packed as well as the other 7 sets I recieved and as a result, was broken. Amazon was quick to replace it, but it was still an unfortunate situation."
4,Strange Mixture,"Capital records never cease to surprise me. Ernie released four great Christmas Lps, but none have been released in its entirity. This album has ""The Little Drummer Boy"" from his ""Sing We Now of Christmas"" album and ""Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem"" from his ""Christmas album"". The remaining tracks are from his classic ""The Star Carol"" lp that entered charts every year for five years after its release. Capital records, please, don't give us a sorry complitation like this. Release at least one album in its entirity! Bill Gaither and the Ford brothers have released a 2 CD set of his Christmas songs. Hopefully Amazon will soon be selling online."
4,"Where is ""Some Children See Him""?","I absolutely agree with the other reviewers - there are not enough cuts on this CD. I remember the LP ""The Star Carol"" from my childhood which included most of these songs but had others as well. This is obviously a distillation of at least two LP's. Why not include ALL of the cuts available. I would love to have the complete ""Star Carol"" on CD; as other reviewers have said, that LP WAS Christmas!"
5,Can't find better quality,Awesome shirts:1. Versatile - wear them on multiple occasions2. Flattering fit3. Absolutely top notch quality4. Interesting and always changing designsMy husband loves them. I only wish they produced womens shirts too
1,Buyer Beware of Kindle Edition,"None of the tables or illustrations are included in the Kindle edition, and without them, the book is significantly impaired and incomplete.This is a rip off. I am going to pursue a refund, and I expect to get one, e-book or no. Stealing from customers is WRONG.I am surprised at both Van Tharp and Amazon.I've recently encountered various problems with Kindle books. If Amazon can't start enforcing some quality control, I'm going to take my business elsewhere."
1,Rehash of Tharp's Original,"Brian June does not offer anything of value to this publication. The rest was already taught by Van Tharp in his other book. M only question is if Van Tharp knows what mindset a trader must have, why doesn't he trade?"
1,Worthless book,"After reading all the great reviews this book has received, I expected to get a good book that would guide me to great fortunes. After all, the title suggests financial freedom, doesn't it? Well I ddin't quite achieved what the titles suggests. In fact I consistantly lost money following the philosophies of this book. If you want something that works, buy Jeff Cooper's Hit & Run Trading."
4,Good book for the nuts and bolts of trading,"This book was a great addition to the other books I have read about trading for a living. While Gary Smith's book was his actual trading process and Alexander Elder's covered the psychological dynamics of creating a system, this book really got into the technical dynamics of risk and expectancy with formulas and excellent explanations of how to be profitable based on your amount of trades/risk/expectancy.The six key elements you will understand for making money in the market from this book are:1. System reliability2. reward to risk ratio3. cost of trading4. Your trading opportunity level5. What you can do based on the size of your equity6. Your position sizing algorithmThis is a more technical read than other books and comes across very tedious at times, but I found it well worth the effort for the added insights I received."
5,Great book for professiona traders,"I started to read this book few days ago. I got the book from amazon more than a year ago. After I started to read, I found out that the book has alot of information for traders.The reason is I have red alot of trading books during this time and I have to say that this one is really good. Most of the books that I have red are to general and you do not learn that much.. It shows you how to create a plan, knowing your edge, be decipline, and know your trading strategy. Trading strategy means that you have to know what type of trader are you. Are you Scalping trader, Swing or momentom trader. Any way this book is more usfull for traders who have experiance.For new ones it is a little bit difficult to digest. My recomendation is that buy this book if you have few years of experiance in trading."
2,Financial Freedom Through Self-Indulgent Authorship,"It's hard to believe that this was published in December, 2000. The author describes NYSE scalping without decimalization and Chapter 1 describes a trade in INTC at 137.Overall, this ""how-to"" was far too esoteric and short on strategy. The author is a psychologist which is all one needs to know.There are much better resources available inlcuding Nassar's book and the Underground.com Guide."
2,"A Rehash, without much meaningful addition","Van Tharp's first book, Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom, is outstanding, and highly recommended. This follow-up book, however, is not. The author spends the first portion of it reintroducing the topics of his first work. He then goes in to a discussion of day trading in Level II stocks (and the like). This was clearly an effort to take advantage of the market environment at the time. In doing that, however, Van Tharp made the fatal mistake of creating a limited lifespan for this work. Don't waste your money here. If you haven't already read Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom, do so. If you have, read it again. This follow-up book won't tell you anything new and the first has much more substance."
1,Not that great!,This wasn't that great at all it was very kinda bad and can't rewind or fast forwarding on DVD
3,eeeh,I've never used final cut before and this book doesn't dumb it down enough for a beginner. It does have lots of non beginner techniques however. If your just starting out wait on buying this book.
4,"Controversial, But I Like It Anyway","For all 10 or so of you out there who have heard this, I'll bet 5 of you love it and 5 of you hate it; and nobody is in between. The reason you feel that way is that you believe that ""Revolver"" is one of the absolute hallmarks of the '60's (and you're right, of course); and this album takes the psychedelia of the Beatles to new heights (note what's not on this album: ""Here There and Everywhere"". The prettiest Beatles song ever, IMHO; and much too pretty for this album). Some of you will hate that anybody had the chutzpah to try to ""out-do"" the Beatles; and some of you will admire the ""chutzpah"" of anyone who tried and appeared to ""out-do"" the Beatles. So rate it without reference to The Fab Four, if you can; and on that scale, it's pretty good. Ann Dyer is not the most vocally gifted singer in the world; but she gets it done with what she has, and the end result is always interesting. Recommended."
2,Dyer Buyers BEWARE!,"There are a few good cuts on this album, the key word is ""few"". I agree with an earlier reviewer that some of the tracks are un-listenable. Ann does have an amazing voice; how many modern singers can sound exactly like a kitten with its tail caught in a screen door? Ann Dyer can. How many singers can make you hate a wonderful, melodic, Beatles song? Ann can. Some of the tracks ARE listenable, and sound a little similar to Patricia Barber, the key words here are ""a little"". Ms Barber, however, is much, much better. Doing a complete Beatles album in a jazz style is a tremendous and original concept, however Ms. Dyer has failed. Those of you interested, listen to all the samples b/4 u buy!"
1,Expensive for no reason,"This chair is extremely uncomfortable, I should know I have to sit in it all day at work. The arms can not be lowered sufficiently to be out of the way of the desk. Also it takes forever to tighten the arms at which point if you tighten the wrong way, it slips down. I have tried 2 different chairs and both seem to be lopsided where I feel as if I am leaning in my chair which can not be good for your back. Many people at work have the same complaints and many of us reallllly want new chairs. Save your money or buy a real executive chair."
2,Too big to orient correctly.,"The product description said this was 22 inches long. Wrong! It was 57 inches long! It is designed to be mounted on a wall horizontally. Unfortunately, both walls in the corner where my stereo is are at 45 degrees from the direction of the majority of stations I wanted to receive. So I just got more static than anything. I even tried putting it on my outside wall with no luck. I returned the item and got the Terk Edge desktop powered FM antenna, and that did the trick."
4,Works well,"This antenna works well for me. In comparison to a standard non-amplified dipole or my older less-expensive Terk antenna, it provides a stronger signal that is largely free of noise to my receivers. My situation is that I'm located about 50 miles from the nearest city from which most stations are broadcast. Many radio stations are too far to receive well. This antenna has largely fixed that problem. This is a (bi-)directional antenna and works best for radio stations with the antenna length perpendicular to the directions (front and rear) of the radio stations you wish to receive. In cases where radio stations surround you, an omni-directional antenna may work better. Also note that you need some signal to work with, so if located in a sub-basement no antenna may help you."
1,TERK FM-50 not worth the money,"Buy the $5.00 Dipole flat twin wire antenna at Radio Shack, it does just as good a job."
