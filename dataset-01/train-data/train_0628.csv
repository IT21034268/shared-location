2,Cushion went flat after a few weeks,"My right hand is extra sensitive and after a few weeks the cushion became too flat for me to be able to use this support. It was applying pressure in all the wrong areas and did not last nearly as long as i would have liked. I still use it on the left side which is less sensitive, however at the time of purchase, it was under the impression that these would remain more supportive than they actually did. There's no telling how long it will be before I won't be able to use it on my left hand either."
2,did the trick at first...,"but after wearing them for a couple of weeks my hands & wrists started to hurt, mostly on the top, and my fingers began aching like having arthritis. may work for some but not for me..."
3,Very good but not if you have large muscular or fat wrist/forearms,"I agree that this is a GREAT base, but I have muscular wrists/forearms that make this brace very tight. I can't even fasten the strips.I can tolerate it, but not for longer than a couple hours.Muscular or fat forearmed people...be warned."
3,"comfortable, but the velcro doesn't last","I've used many different types of wrist support since I have mild carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands. This was very comfortable - soft, and breathable. Only issue is the velcro lasted about 8 months and then I had to throw them away."
1,Dig into your palm,Perhaps there are several sizes of this brand of wrist brace but I found that when I went to wear them my wrists/hands hurt MORE. The problem stems from how they sew on the squishy bead. It is hard and digs into my wrists right at the location where I feel the greatest pain. I also got them from a three letter chain. Reading these reviews it looks like people love them. I don't. Your mileage may vary.
3,too big for small hands,"I wake up with pain in my fingers. I have tried to loosen it but then it does not fit correctly. I wish they made it according to the size of the hand and not one fits all. the metal end actually left a scar on my arm, and I have to make sure I have it loose enough to not hurt, but I thought it needs to be a fit snug."
4,A Good Choice for night use,"This revised edition is better than the previous ones. It is longer and relatively comfortable, easy to slip on after one initial adjustment, and keeps my wrist stable through the night."
3,Great but how can I wash this thing it smells like @$$ !!,All the breathing in the world can't stop this nasty thing from smelling when it comes to my sweating at night! I need something I can wash! Frebreeze does nothing but make it smell worse! The thought of putting something this dirty on at night makes me sick! I have a wife as well so I feel bad about stuff like that.
2,Too large for our use,"The concept was OK, but the brace was too large for my wife's arm. But to be fair, she is quite petite."
4,AN excellent resource,"This book has as much NLP packed into it as any NLP book I've come across. Language patterns, Stratagies, states, Calibration, it's all there. It's only problem is that unless you already know the jargon, many of the descriptions may be to brief. Still for anyone who knows NLP and wants to have it all in one place, an excellent buy."
4,Way to Secular for a Gospel CD,"I love R&B just as much as the next person, but when you just change the words to God it doesn't quite hit the mark. Don't get me wrong, the harmonies are beautiful and I especially love ""The Question Is"", but I just thing Woody should figure out if he's for God or Dru Hill. I'm sure a lot of people out there will disagree with me but I've gotta speak the truth. As a Chrisian, you've gotta set the standard and I just don't feel that this cd is doing that."
5,Get in Shape Fast,I first purchased this in VHS in 1986 and paid big bucks but what I know is that you will see results in 10 workouts. As I started getting weaker over the years aging I'm 47 5'4. I recently lost 15 pounds I didn't want to gain the weight back so I got this on vcd from ebay and yes it is taking longer but I started in July and I'm already in really good shape. This is the best most efficient workout if you can do it because it will kick your butt.
5,The FIRM,I love this first FIRM video and Susan Harris as the instructor. I have over the years gotten all the FIRM videos and this is the best and easiest to follow.I do this one over and over. I wish they would made a DVD of this.
5,We need Susan Harris's The Firm - Total Body in DVD!,"I started using Sunan Harris's The FIRM total body sculpt when it first came out. Overthe past 15 years, I have pulled out the tape to re-tweek my shape. I have stayed between 105 and 115lbs. at 5'4"" into my early 40s. This tape has PROVED itself. I have purchased 3 VHS copies of this same tape over the years. WHEN are they going to make a DVD version of some of their most popular tapes. The demand is still there."
5,Great if you want to loose weight and reshape your body,I did this tape faithfully every day for three months and I lost 50lbs. and the shape of my body changed drastically. I got muscles in my calves that I never had before and I lost a lot of inches. The workout is very challenging and rewarding if you stick to it. I would like to see an updated version of this tape with Susan Harris. It's been well worth the money. I will always keep a extra copy of this tape in case something should happen to the one I have. I don't want to ever be without this tape. It has helped me tremendously. I give much thanks to Susan Harris and producers of the FIRM. Out of all of the Firm tapes this is my favorite.
5,THE BEST,"This is the first workout tape I ever used and it resulted in me being in the best shape of my life. No matter what I use I always go back to this one.Sadly, The Firm is discontinuing this particular tape/DVD.As a male I often find my friends snickering a bit (of course a woman turned me onto this workout), but when I challenge them to do the entire tape they come back to me with, ""Wow, I take back everything I said.""Someone needs to tell the people at the Firm to release an anniversary version of this DVD instead of discontinuing it, so others can benefit from Susan Harris's great workout and terrific instructions."
5,Classy and Elegant... A fitness classic for good reason!,"After all these years, this is still one of the best fitness videos ever produced! So pleased it is still available and now on DVD format! A challenging, motivational and top notch workout with good cuing by Susan Harris. Sure, the outfits may seem a tad outdated, but the production of this fitness video was truly so well done that I do not find it cheesy or distracting at all. I never would have thought to call a workout video classy or elegant, but The Firm Body Sculpting Basics is just that! Most importantly, it works! Keep at it and work up to doing the workouts in their entirety if it is difficult at first--you will see (and feel!) results!"
5,Brief But Honest Review,Excellent workout! You will feel this one and at the end complete exhaustion occurs. Too bad this is not on DVD.
5,my legs are in great shape,"This video is great.I started using it after I had my baby and I had no muscle tone I was so over weight.The leg moves are great .They are hard but with time you build strength and get through it I did.Use it ,it works.I see the results I wanted."
5,One word. AWESOME!,Definately not for beginners. Kick [butt] floor work. An all around great choice for anyone looking to get in shape. Fast. I found this video to be a real challange although I owned several Firm tapes before this one.One thing though....
5,I love it!,"This is my favorite Firm video (so far). It is long, hard, challenging but I can finally do it all. I don't care about the ""look"" of the instructor or the participants (""80's"" funny). There is no annoying music. I only wish the ab workout were longer but the whole video is already 51 minutes long! I am looking for a Firm step workout if anyone can recommend anything."
1,A let down....,"I used to workout to this video and other Firm videos and remembered them to be more of a challenge years ago. But with changes to workout styles, The Firm vintage series is a let down. Plus after a short while, Susan Harris and the others are annoying to watch. Too dated."
2,Don't start with this one! There are better Firm videos. . .,"I love The Firm videos, but my advice is not to start with this one. Instructor Susan Harris is brutally fit and even though I am in moderately good shape and have been using The Firm videos 3 to 4 times a week for several months, I have had a few back surgeries, am over 40 (OK, close to 50!), and just can't keep up with her! I prefer (and recommend) The Firm videos with great instructors like Tracie Long who explains and demonstrates good form."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I bought this tape recently because I wanted to expand my FIRM collection. I was so disappointed I sold it in an auction after just 3 sessions! I tried to be patient, but it wasn't for me. The beginning was good, but 3/4 of the tape is floor leg work. I find this type of workout boring. I don't mind a bit of pain, (which it produces) but I need some stimulation too!! If you want a good workout with weights I would recommend Cross Trainers: Strength and Cardio, or Vol. 6 !!"
5,The Firm: Total Body - Body Sculping Basics(VHS),This tape helps you look normal and not muscular. You see good results and your clothes fit better and you lose inches as well.
5,swaneegirl,"This is the best workout ever! It's old school, so you have to forgive the hair and clothes. I've been working out for 35 years and this is still the best I've ever come across. Thanks Amazon for having it!"
5,The Firm Total Body Body Sculpting Basics,"Hi, Just letting everyone no that this the best tape ever. My mom who is now 65, gave me this tape back in 1994. I was in my early 20. When I did this tape, I called my mom and said to her (what Hell,our you really doing this tape)!"" It kick my back side. I lost this tape about month go, and really was upset about it. So thank god for amazon, I will keep this tape forever! you will be glad you bought this tape, I'm on my way to looking hot! And yes, susan harris sounds like she's enjoying herself on the tape, was a little distracting, but got use to it when drop about 10inchs of my body!lol so get the tape while you can,."
5,Excellent complete body workout,I started exercising 14 years ago with The Firm (I am 43 now). I was so weak at 29 I had to start with no weights and WORKED UP to 1 1/2 lb. dumbbells which was a struggle. As others have said this workout is not easy--a beginner may have to take frequent breaks and/or reduce the numbers of reps performed. But it is worth every effort you make. You won't need to do it very long (even you beginners) to see results. Something I think is extremely valuable is the the info section at the end of the workout. It is educational and motivating. Over the years they have updated their research to keep it current with respect to new exercise techniques. Today I am in excellent condition thanks to The Firm. Even if I get away from exercising for a while my body seems to spring back from years of conditioning. Body By Jake is the #2 video I would recommend.
3,You'll get fit if you can get past the spandex.....,"This video uses all the tride and true moves for muscle building, stretching, and cardio, that have been around for years. It is a long workout and you will definitely see results in time. My main problem with the video was the fact that it was made in 1995 but the class is taught like it was 1985. The music is less than motivating, I still cant get past the leotards, leg warmers, jewelry, and the teachers whispy, deep voice. For a good seller I hope in the next video they actually have a budget that allows them to use costumes, music, and moves from this time period. I was not motivated to work hard and you'll find the same workout with better film quality on any of the other hundreds of exercise videos out there."
3,I may be spoiled but,"In spite of all the comments stating that the 80's theme was interfering with this workout, I didn't notice any such thing. Sure, the costumes are from the 80s, but the music is easy on the ears. Instructor doesn't have puffy hair and overall my qualms aren't in that area.The tape was apparently designed to make you break a sweat, and sure works great on that. However I didn't feel like I was actually working from deep inside my muscles, the exercises seemed repetitive and too fast. Lots of running-like aerobics. I'm naturally thin, so I look to fitness DVDs for muscle definition, not losing fat. This one I'm sure works well on fatty tissues and if you can stand the pain.. To sum it up I more and more appreciate my Cindy Crawford fitness DVDs. You don't feel like a rabbit on steroids and you still get a nice workout and definition in all the right areas. After reviewing about 10 of the top rated workout systems I found on Amazon her dvds remain to be my favorites."
1,Unbearable Music,"This video may help me to develop better all around body strength, but the music is simply the worst I've heard on a workout tape. Additionally, the instructor speaks in a whispery, breathy, Marilyn Monroe type voice. The whole thing seems to be straight out of Las Vegas. I couldn't even get through it one time."
1,For Masochists Only!!!,"Holy Crap I thought I was going to die when I tried this video. My sister bought this video several years back and at the time I considered myself in pretty good shape. I exercised daily and loved doing aerobics and weightlifting classes. So, one day I decided to try this video. I think I made it about a half-hour into the video and quit because I thought I was going to collapse.Then I found out my sister had tried it with her friend and they lasted about 15 minutes before they gave up. Then I found out my mother tried it and she only lasted about 5 minutes. It has sat on the shelf unused since.Basically, unless you're like at an Olympic fitness level, I wouldn't even attempt this video. It's just too hard."
5,Wonderful Workout!!!,This truly is a workout!!! It works all areas of the body. Be prepared to sweat. Great video. I would recommend it to anyone!!!
5,The Firm Still Has IT!,"This video is still the best body shaping workout around. I remember when I first got it back in the 80's. I was in my 20's and it kicked my butt at first so I was a bit worried about getting through it at 53, but I made it through the entire video (using lighter weights) and was sore the next day. AHH.. I remembered how it felt the first time...The hip and butt routine are tough but motivating and it really does work. You don't get results without exhausting those muscle groups. The Firm is still the best and those original Volumes are the best complete body shaping workouts I have ever tried!"
5,my review of Vol. 1,"This workout continues to be one of the best videos ever produced by The FIRM. It was the video that made me like the video series when I first tried at 14 years of age with two five pound dumbells. Then, I was hooked. This video hold a special place in my heart, and has never become outdated for me. I love it! You'll love it, too. It has the feel of a classic workout, but it enjoyable each time it is done. A long stretching segment at the end especially leave you feeling great. It's got the hardest set of floor work for the legs out of all their videos. It is truly an incredible production!"
4,Basics - And then some,"This tape is not for beginners. I found it to be the most difficult and intense of all the classic series. Lots of lungs, squats, straddles, etc. I do not believe a beginner and can start with 3,5, and 8 pounds. It should be 1,3, and 5 at the most. Although I have used this video quite often, I find myself sore the next day.I highly recommend it for advanced exercisers and those who have great muscle tone already.I will never get bored of the FIRM, and look forward to future productions."
5,The best workout video ever,"This video is great because you can do even just the first 10-15 minutes of it and feel as though you've exercised a good portion of your body without overdoing it, yet building muscles easily. Once you get to know the video, it just feels great to work through the whole thing. You can always make it harder by adding weights, but I've found they aren't necessary at all to make the workout worthwhile."
5,This is the classic Firm video -- It's Great!,"I was first introduced to this video six years ago. At the time it was all I could do to finish the video -- let alone add weights. But just last year when I got serious about getting in shape, I remembered what a great workout this tape is and decided to get a copy for myself.I've never regretted it.This video not only is an aerobic work-out, but also helps tone muscles. Upper body and lower body. My husband even does this work-out sometimes and it's challenging for him too.Don't let the '80s instructor's outfits turn you from trying this tape. It's great!"
3,Definitely not for beginners,"This video is definitely not for beginners. I am not in great shape and when the instructor goes into a 15 minute jog I have to stop and watch. It would be better if there some variation for beginners. Because of this, I didn't feel as though I got a challenging aerobic workout. The strength training section was better. I am using other workout tapes to get in better shape. Maybe then I can keep up with this one."
5,Soooo Reeeelaxxxinnnngg,"I've never listened to this type of music in my life before.However most tracks on this CD are perfect for Qigong / taichi.If you close your eyes whilst practicing, you can be instantly in a forest or on a beach doing your practice, highly recommended. I think from memory 2 or 3 tracks I didn't copy to my ipod, but the rest are well worth the investment."
5,This is amazing!,"I have had this brand straightener for years and loved it. It finally died, so I order a new one. It's amazing friends keep asking me what I've been doing to my hair it's looks amazing. Worth the money!!"
3,Seems like a good product,"Does what it's suppose to do, with the caveat that it does not support more recent monitors, i.e. those having a native resolution higher than 1024X768."
2,good but cheap,i just retired my 2nd or 3rd N4 (can't remember) and they've all failed after about 2 years of light use. It's a decent product when it works although it has limited resolution. VS has stopped making them which is probably just as well. Viewsonic has been a total _____ type of a company to deal with. I've purchased their monitors and LCD TV's and have found their CS to be about the worst in the industry. They clearly don't get it anymore. Too bad they were a decent company in the 90s.
5,Best Ever,"This is the best I've yet come accross on knot tying;and that includes numerous books,which try very hard I am sure.But the old saying:a picture is worth a thousand words comes into play here.A good video could be worth a thousand pictures? This is a good tutorial,yet not boring."
5,The New Testament as an historical document,"Grant has managed to treat the life of Jesus as one would treat any historical figure. He has sidestepped centuries of interpretation and misinterpretation, and presents a portrait of Jesus based on the actual historical evidence. It is not the Jesus we are used to, and Grant's own interpretations challenge many common assumptions"
5,Jesus,"Excellent book. Michael Grant writes in a clear and concise way about how much we know about Jesus and how we can decide what parts of the Gospels are historical and what parts are mythical. If you believe in the Bible literally, you may have trouble with this book, but if you want to know what parts of the Jesus story are history and what parts are not, you will find this book fascinating"
3,The Jesus of History,"This book provoked many feelings, from curiosity to hate. Perhaps this is just what Michael Grant expected or wanted. He should be commended for taking on such a controversial subject. The inclusion of works other than the Bible, however, would have given the book a greater historical impact. Unfortunately, Michael Grant fails to follow his original thesis of fully explaining the Gospels in a historically correct fashion. The one constant in the book is Grant's writing style, it reads easily. Read the book it will either make one a better Christian or cause one to seek a new religion either way it will be an experience."
4,good,"looks nice, currently works wellit's not as bright as I thought to light up my whole bedroom, but works well for readingthe brightness of light cannot be adjusted, that's the only disadvantage I find now"
2,Poor Quality,"Lamp arrived with an inoperable switch. It can only be turned on and off by using a switchable extension cord. Upon reviewing the steps required to return the item, such as getting a preauthorize return form and the shipping cost of returning the lamp plus a restocking fee it wasn't worth the effort. I'll just be careful to insure I do not order any additional items from this manufacturer."
2,Mixed Review - Updated,"From the start I really liked this tool. However, almost immediately the adjustable handle locks got really got real flaky and would become unlocked. Now after 7-months the spot welds on the pan came apart making it unusable. It is a real shame because this could have received 5-stars with a little quality control.Updated* - I contacted the manufacturer directly and they sent out a complete new unit with no questions asked."
5,pooper scooper,"Great product, I can pick up after my 2 large dogs with no problems and the pan and spade clean up easily."
2,scooper,"I purchased this in anticipation of a lot of clean up ""duty"" and for the fact that it looked like it was pretty heavy duty and could be left outside all year. Everything was OK except that the telescoping shaft of the scooper/shovel would not securely lock into place, so it's always very loose and wiggly. The black piece used for tightening it also split the second day. That piece however, doesn't seem to make any difference when you tighten the two pieces together. Even when tightened as hard as you can get it, the ""joint"" is still loose. I am thinking about trying to take it apart and put a piece of dowel wood to reinforce."
3,does the job but not very handy,I had better expectations for this. Overall its OK but it is not very handy. I got the large one and it is big and clumsy walking around with it collecting poop.I think the smaller version would maybe be a bit more handy and I would rather go two trips than having to move the big version around.Definately not worth $50.
3,one problem,as everyone has said the handle doesnt stay tightened causing it to go up and down otherwise seems ok would not buy again
1,Poorly made,"This item lasted only 3 uses. During the third use, the metal pole connected to the pan actually bent while emptying it out. Complete waste of money."
4,The sticker lable will drive you mad,"This is a great product, sturdy, funtional, and lightweight. But the label that is stuck on the scooper will annoy you trying to pull it off. I had to use ""Goo be gone"". I cannot clean the scoop with the paper on it once feces comes into contact with it, so i took 10 minutes scraping it off. I have no clue why they did not use an easy peel off label or at least place that label on the bottom of the scooper."
3,equipment needed is not specified,"I was very excited to order my first Firm video, but to my dismay, I found you needed not only dumbbells but a step and a weighted ball to use it. I went back and checked your product details and nowhere does it say you need this equipment. I tried to order the step, but amazon does not sell it. It would be helpful if this was included in the product description since it is plainly visable on the back of the video cover."
3,"Great workout, poor video quality.","I have been a Firm believer since the beginning. This tape has the same elegant set as previous Firms, but the sound and picture quality is not as good. The workout and instructors are marvelous. If you can get past the poor sound and picture, this is the tape for you. (By the way, I have a new VCR and surround sound stereo and this tape still does not sound as good as the prior Firms.)"
2,"good workout, poor quality","Like supersculpt, also produced by goodtimes, the quality on this tape is very poor which is a shame - the workout is pretty good if a little repetitive. Compared to the quality of older firm videos, I was shocked at the sound and picture on this tape and the new Super Sculpt. I won't be playing these tapes again!"
2,Not the best..,"You will sweat, but the video is a bit complicated and takes time to learn all the steps. I also quickly lost interest in the video because of the difficulty of it. Ok cardio workout but I have done much better. Not the best of the FIRM."
2,This is not a beginners text!,"Based on the books description, this appears to be a book for beginners. However, on page xi of the preface, the author states the ""preliminary study"" required to use this book; Joe B Wilson's book Translating Buddhism from Tibetan. I do not mean to indicate this as suggested reading but required. Without Joe's book there is no point in having this one. This should be indicated in the book description. Some day I may read Joe's book. Until then, this book will sit on my book shelf.Here is the link to the book you need to buy with this one:http://www.amazon.com/Translating-Buddhism-From-Tibetan-Introduction/dp/0937938343/ref=pd_sim_b_2Another book I bought at the same is:http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Classical-Tibetan-Stephen-Hodge/dp/9745240397/ref=pd_sim_b_3Of the several books I have been using to learn Tibetan I am finding this one to be a hit. Once I finish this one I will likely buy Joe's book."
4,Interesting if you like Repin...,"I got this free for my Kindle Fire and enjoyed it. Just looking at the pictures told me a lot about Repin starting with his early work with the Peredvizhniki, especially Barge Haulers on the Volga. The only picture I especially missed was Arrest of the Propagandist. I also missed there being more information on each picture but just looking through them I could see how he started as a revolutionary artist and ended up a court pet. There were at least three pictures of the czar including his wedding and Repin's most famous pictures ended up owned by the royal family. Still I enjoyed it. Now I have to decide if I want a hardcopy."
5,A quick way to cheer you up!!!,"I bought this book back in 96 and every year a try to read it at least once, is easy to read and help you focus in how you are in your life right now and which your path in life is.Is easy to complain when thing are not going your way but you also have the oportunity to sit back and regroup to see what changes to make in your life and see what is not working.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to analyze how his/her life is right now and what can be done if your are not content withit, this is just a companion for the whole book you can read Do it! Let's get off our buts.I love this autor and always lift me up when I read some of this books."
4,A great collection!,"If you've never been to Brooklyn you'll have a wonderful time exploring the short stories of some of the most legendary writers in American literature. It's a collection of writers who capture a sense of place, spirit, and culture and do it beautifully. Of course, in any anthology, some stories and writers appeal to each reader moreso than others.As a Brooklyn resident, I found this to be a wonderful collection of 30 perspectives of 30 different aspects of life in Brooklyn. Some aspects are long gone and it's wonderful to catch a glimpse, but surprisingly much of the Brooklynese still rings true. The stories capture the settings, the many cultures which landed and had to mix, and still try to work out the cultural boundaries, the languages and even, of course, the legendary Brooklyn accent er...(da Brukln axe sent)!"
4,Not a bad read,As a commercial aviation enthusiast I really enjoyed this one; this is about as good as you can get for learning about the feel of each aircraft type. However I would have appreciated a box summarizing key performance characteristics for each type that was reviewed.
2,whoa....the worst David Wilcox album by far....,"And I can say that because I own all of them. I was, and still am, a huge fan. I ran out to buy this album as soon as I could, being that there isn't much good music out there to buy these days. After the first few listens, I had to compare it to his other live album, East Asheville Hardware. This album compares UNFAVORABLY with his old album. How can two live albums by the same artist be so totally different? EAH had a certain edge to it, an attitude....even one of self-mockery. On Live Songs and Stories, Wilcox comes off as way too preachy for someone who is, well, not a preacher. I get the feeling that he is taking himself way too seriously on this album. Just shut up and sing, man. You are capable of WAY better than this. The songs are good, the performances of them not so good. Yuck....not recommended. Oh well, I guess I will have to begin the countdown until James Taylor's new album now...."
5,Time for another journey with DW,"I'm so totally confused as to how ""fans"" of David Wilcox could not love this CD!!!! What do us fans love about DW? We love his story telling, his lyrics, his guitar, and his vulnerable baritone voice. This CD has all of that. The stories give great insight and humor into the songs as well, as himself. The guitar playing is just as compelling as in his previous releases. And his voice, combined with his incredible lyrics, once again find their way into my heart to entertain me, teach me things about myself, as well as life.My personal favorites from this CD are Traveling Companion/Words Alone and Appreciating the Differences/Good Together are both GREAT story/song combinations. And Kindness has become a new favorite of mine - what a perfectly written and sung song.If you've ever enjoyed any of his prior music, or want to experience the depth of one of his concerts, this is a great way to do it. You won't be disappointed."
5,David Wilcox Is Awesome,"Like sitting in a small room and hearing his thoughts and the resulting music. Humor, melody, poetry, and as ever that incredible guitar."
5,"This CD captures the essence of Dave; witty, fun, insightful","I have garnered more fans for this great folk artist through this CD as David converses with the audience, lighting their souls with laughter, touching on childhood experiences with homage and capturing the emotions of the heart. If you are new to David Wilcox, I would recommend this CD and Eye of the Hurricane, though for me, Home Again CD with its ""Burgundy Heart Shaped Medallion"" will always remain my favorite."
1,More of the same stale act...,"...ho, hum. Listen as David Wilcox sings ""meaningful"" lyrics about being a good person! Marvel as he tells that witty joke you heard at the last two concerts - and with the same dramatic inflections! Gasp as he imparts his sage wisdom unto the worshipful audience! Amazing!! But was this really necessary? Somebody please get me a cup of coffee to wake me up."
5,"Real, Authentic Music","I can't say enough about this album. For those who are familiar with Dave's work this album will be very familiar. For those who are interested in getting aquainted with him, this may be the best way to invite him into your home. The recordings are warm and alive and consist of both songs and stories.The thing that strikes me most about the album is how real it is. No pomp or glamour here. No boy bands or synthesizers or dance moves or nasty lyrics or the like are to be found on this album. Just a warm voice, beautiful, simple guitar and lyrics that will have you wondering just how did Dave know that about you."
4,Heartfelt singer-songwriter and guitar master,"In this, his second album of live music, David Wilcox adds stories to his songs to give everyone a taste of how delightful his live concerts are! Some previously released tracks like ""Show the Way"" and ""Kindness"" are crowd pleasers; some previously unreleased tracks like ""No Far Away""speak to the current troubles in the world as much as they did when he first performed it 10 or so years ago. The stories are engaging and amusing as well as uplifting. David Wilcox is a stand-out as a gifted guitarist and singer-songwriter who is awake and paying attention. Try to catch him live if you can; if you can't, this CD is the next best thing!"
5,embarrasing,...at how much better sly and the family stone are to everyone else. What a record! every track a funky masterpeice and how good is the production? You just simply can not fault them. After owning all their records this was the last one on the list and its right up there with the rest of the masterpeices ; stand fresh a whole new thing and of course riot. Nice one
4,Multi pressure Regulator handy compared to the one that comes with the Presto 23 qt canner.,Bought this to use instead of the 15 lb PR that came with the cooker/canner I bought. That way I don't have to worry about checking the gauge.
5,Great regulator.,"A simple adjustable pressure regulator for Presto pressure canners. It is not listed for use with the 23 quart Presto pressure canner (0178107), BUT it works perfectly. Good quality construction and simple to use. 5 out of 5.Here is the instructions that came with it for reference:[...]"
5,Makes pressure canning faster and easier,"I have a 23 qt. Presto pressure gauge canner that comes with a 15 lb weight that essentially serves as a safety device, necessitating precise temperature regulation to maintain the correct pressure when canning. The addition of this three-piece pressure regulator makes canning so much easier--I don't have to babysit the canner. As long as I'm in the right ballpark with the setting on my stove, causing a little steam to escape around the pressure regulator, the correct pressure is maintained. I am amazed that this is not included with all pressure canners sold by Presto."
1,lack of instructions and markings,This came without any instructions and there are no markings indentfying what weights. Difficult to use this way. I was not satisfied with this product.
3,Australian SF Reader,"Morgan Roche, a woman with a talent for computing, is given a mission to safeguard a portable A.I.. A chase story with telepaths, enigmatic superhumans and other fun elements.So, she is in danger a lot of the time, but not quite sure why she is, or why the 'Box' is so important to what is going on."
4,Out of the frying pan,"Two aussie up and coming authors write a sci-fi story with Indianna Jones like rolling action. Ideas and depth of culture and science I found most enjoyable. The book was full to the brim of twists, betrayals and action.Two males writing from a female perspective, I found this intriguing, being a male I can't say whether they pulled it off or not with any authority.Although this is the first of a trilogy it easily stands alone as a work with a begining and a definate outcome, which I find refreshing."
4,"As Usual With Firm Workouts, This Has A Lot To Be Said For It!","I'm not sure how much ""time"" I saved, but I always learn a little about technique with any and all of the Firm videos and DVDs. I prefer not to do high-impact workouts, so I modify and just take advantage of the boot camp style energy to keep me motivated. I like some of the others better, but nothing wrong with this one."
3,Becareful!,"If you are extremely over weight or have knee issues, you will want to skip this one. I have allot of the older Firm tapes and like them allot, but you can hurt yourself with this one. There's allot of repetitive stepping on the small box, which can hurt your knees."
5,A killer! Great instruction.,"I first did this workout, also known as Classics Volume 4, years ago. I bought it mainly because Susan Harris was the lead, frankly, and Kai S. is very likable, but I am a member of the S. Harris Fan Club. I was disappointed that Susan's Southern accent was gone on this tape, but her terrific instruction skills are still evident, and Kai is also very good at cuing. It's heavy and the upper body work is a killer. This is also one of the last tapes that doesn't feature an instructor who has implants, and I think that's a good thing. I feel most - not all - of the current Firm instructors have implants, and that promotes unrealistic expectations. Tracie is a terrific instructor, but I would just prefer to see more ""natural"" women, personally. But that's part of the Firm's marketing - they put these impossible bodies on the cover, and we buy the tapes hoping to one day look like that. The bottom line, however, is that they are very good workouts, for the most part."
4,Short on time? This Workout Delivers Fast Results!,"This video makes a great introduction to the FIRM. It's shorter than most FIRM workouts (45 minutes) and the weight work is not as heavy as other FIRM workouts, but it's still FIRM tough!. You'll need two or three sets of weights and an aerobic step. This video is an oldy. I think it was part of the first series of workouts from the late 80's, so you'll see lots of make-up, jewelry and ice cream sherbert colored workout wear. But don't let the 80's cheese discourage you. This is a quality workout that will let you see results in ""10 workouts""."
2,Wish I hadn't bot it,"It may work, but I'll never find out because no normal human being can possibly keep up with 2 very fast, over-zealous workout instructors. The ab workout has had to have been spliced together from several minutes of different times. I like workout routines that at least appear to be for the average person. It may work, but there is no way I would want to work out and become this obsessed. I currently work out 3 times a week to several different DVDs and instructors and I like The Firm overall, but this one I hate!"
1,Not as challenging as I remembered....,"I used to workout to this video and other Firm videos and remembered them to be more of a challenge years ago. But with changes to workout styles, The Firm vintage series is a let down."
3,"Excellent Workout, Poor Production","This Firm video makes for a great, quick workout. I purchased this tape because I needed something short, and this really fits the bill. However, when I first watched it, I was dismayed at the awful music, and poor production values. You can see the boom mikes hanging down in front of the camera many, many times! There are also blue screens behind the ""doors"" on the set that were never changed into any kind of scenery.I really get into a tape when the music is fun & upbeat, but this stuff is odd, not always appropriate for the movements & just plain awful!If this kind of stuff is important to you (which I didn't think was that important to me, but is!), there are many other Firm tapes that may be better.BUT, I have to say, that the workout is still good, and I've enjoyed adding extra weights as I've gone along. It's just hard to make myself do this tape when I've got other, newer ones that give me less of a headache to look at."
5,the firm workout,I have always enjoyed the firm videos. This one makes you sweat and keeps that heart rate going...nice thing is the time...fortyfive minutes for those days you want to exercise..but need to keep it short
4,if our arborvitae could talk . . .,They would thank us.I've wrapped the shrubs with burlap first and thought it was enough. The deer just pushed and pulled it around to get to the shrubs. Then I wrapped them in this netting and no more issues with deer. I used zip ties to secure. A second person would be helpful to keep this stuff straight to cut and ... stay off it when cutting and measuring. This stuff catches shoe treads rather easily. Its pretty comical.
3,Good product,"This is just the standard deer netting. This one's nice and tall. Nothing really special about it, just a perfectly adequate product for a good price"
2,internet farmer,This deer netting was much lighter weight than some bird netting I recently purchased from another site. How can deer netting be lighter than bird netting? I put it up around some new trees anyway and we will see if the deer just run through it when food gets scarce around here. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Deer Away,"Product did work to keep the deer out of my garden, I simply stapled it up to the post around the garden. Was a little disipointed that strong winds accompanied with rain did tend to rip the fence down where I stapled it, however someone could figure out a better way to hang it up. This fence is only good for about 2 seasons of use. I took mine down in the fall and put back up in the spring, but the UV from sun must have made some spots brittle as a had large areas rip uut in the last wind storm, I simply weaved them back together with some string, but dont see getting a third year out of it. Overall rating from me B, worked, great price, but short life."
1,Did NOT keep deer out!,We put this around our vegetable garden and the deer busted right through it. Rabbits chewed their way through. Didn't keep anything out!
3,decent,"smaller animals have chewed right through it at the lower parts of it, but it does keep the deer out..."
5,"""turning stereotypes on their head.""","Gurnah, a professor of English & post-colonial literature at the University of Kent, has written a wonderfully satisfying novel blending history & colonialization. He treats us to a glimps of the inner psychology of his characters. I read it years ago but still hear it's quite refrains. It has tremendous staying power."
3,Too bad it's not a plastic composite,"Eventually, it will rust. I have it near the shower (not in it), and I live in a high humidity area. But it's functional and okay-looking for the price"
1,Total rip off by Amazon,"I was supposed to recieve a used copy for five bucks, instead, Amazon sent me a brand new copy and charged me $25!!!! This DVD is definetely not worth $25. What a RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Truth,"The Live Experience is something that I wish I could've seen in person, but listening to this album makes you feel as if you are there anyway. You'd be surprised how fast you tear up once you start to actually think about how far you've been brought by him in his grace. One stand out song I have been listening to since I was about 12 is Helen's Testimony. Even at that young age I knew she was speaking the truth and it served as a ""sermon on the go"" if you will, this album is exactly what a lot of people need to hear. Get saved people...it's the only way!"
5,IF YOU WANT TO BE MOVED - BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!,"I bought this cassette at a sale for $1.99 from a scripture book store and never played it. 2 years later - WOW, now I need to find the DVD if there is one or the next best thing- the CD. We are jazz addicts and love God immensely, so this great great combination of flavours has pleased both my wife and I. The only other compilation that has mesmerized us like this one is the DVD titled ""The Gospel According to Jazz Chapter II"" by Kirk Whallum, with the likes of Jonathon Butler who is from our home town-South Africa."
3,gospel music,Not what I expected.She is a great singer though! I felt short changed. The cd seemed like is was her first cut.
3,Caught Between Great Sound and Animation,"Aye, I jumped at the blu-ray when I saw it was available, and like many others, I put the BD in and was loving the sound and picture; then, the animation hit... Don't want to sound like Cream but ""What a Bringdown."" I immediately looked for the ""stop the animation"" option--there was none. Like another viewer, I turned it off. I'm trying to decide to whether to keep it (for the better sound and use it for background while I'm working on the computer) or selling it because I will not put up with watching those animations. No one can afford the amount of arrogance it's taken to ""make us"" watch the animations. When I want to watch cartoons, I dial up Foghorn Leghorn. When I want the best concert I've ever seen or heard, I go with Yes's ""DVD"" of Symphonic Live. [You can bet the group, YES, all got the BDs with no animation.]"
2,What a shame!,"I love this concert. That's why it hurts giving it only 2 stars for the bluray version. I agree with another reviewer about the animation on Gates of Delirium which is also my favorite cut. The forced animation absolutely ruins it. All I can think is that this was a mistake. The regular DVD version has a bypass option so why is there not one on the bluray? I rewatched the standard DVD and it really only has marginally less picture quality than the bluray and the audio is completely acceptible. I find it hard to believe anyone would actually like the animation so my advice to anyone that is considering the bluray, forget it and get the regular DVD. Maybe someday they will realize their mistake and reissue the bluray with the bypass option."
5,sem titulo,"Bom dia!Eu no posso dar opinio sobre este produto, pois ainda no o recebi, efetue a compra dia 18/10 já se passaram 30 dias e ainda no recebi o produto. assim quereceber fao meu comentario!"
5,I would read it again!,"No one knows it more than Isabel Campion that life is not very thrilling for a young girl living in London, England in 1592. Leaving her frustrations at home, she finally decides to make her own adventure, even though she knows it's risky. However, taking that risk just might be the beginning of the change of pace she was looking for. Her dreams just might be in reach.The author did an excellent job of incorporating just enough facts about the time period, and about their daily lifestyle, that the entire story seemed very realistic.I loved everything about the book and I would read it again in a heartbeat!"
2,I can't understand it,"I bought Daylite to replace my ACT! contact manager when I switched from PC to Mac. It doesn't come with a printed manual, althought they will sell you one for an additional $37 online if you agree to let them use your contact information for marketing purposes. If you don't agree (who would?) you can't buy the manual!ACT! makes sense to me. It's simple to use and effective. Although I'm now committted to using Daylite, it is really confusing. It seems like it is trying to reinvent contact software, but I don't want to reinvent anything, I just want to get to work."
2,"quite well, but ... uh, very stretched","In fact I didn't like this book that much. It's a book, that actually could make me fall asleep very easily. The beginning of the book is soooooooo stretched and stuffed with soooooooo many shortcuts you have to look up in the appendix each time you read them. It takes more than half of the book to until the first real tense situations develop. If you are really interested in space travelling and allready have a basic knowledge of all the functions of each little, glittering button in an Apollo spacecraft, this is the right book for you to read, but else you'd better purchase the video."
5,Read this book!,"Sure, watch the movie! However, the book really brings the event closer to the human heart."
5,A must read book for any one who loves space,"This book displays the courage of the three men, what took place in Mission Control, and what happened at the Lovell's home. At first, I thought it would be just like the movie, or a one person narritive. But once I read it, I knew that I was very wrong. If you saw the movie, and thought that it was great, you must read this book. Apollo 13 the book is much better than Apollo 13 the movie."
2,FOR ENGINEERS ONLY,"A great adventure story, but beyond the courage of the Astronauts and the intense devotion of NASA controllers, (as literature,) it is of interest only to those with special knowledge, in the field. I found it heavy going when the authors focused on the technical aspects of the mechanical failure. And there is alot of this from beginning to end.There have been books which are centered on my area of expertise. I found them fascinating throughout. Many of my friends were bored."
4,An ongoing thriller of heroic action.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book with all of the action and heroism making it a book not to miss
2,worst required text I've had,"I had to get this book for a leadership course in nursing school. The topic is interesting, but this book is the worst for explaining the content. Too wordy, seems to try to write as much as possible about something that can be explained in much less. Most of my classmates agree. ""Contemporary Nursing"" by Cherry is much more interesting and reader friendly then this snoozer.Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management"
4,cute but.....,This shirt was very cute on my dog but the length on the belly side is a bit too long. My dog peed on it a couple times and I had to sew it up. Other than that the shirt is nice and it arrived pretty fast.
4,Great stories,"I've read all but one of these stories in other editions, and I found them quite well-written. While Wells' science is not always up to par with modern standards (the notion that Helium could form a barrier to gravity, for example), it is amusing to see his imagination at work. His characters are quite realistic and very British, as should be expected.I can't say anything about the quality of the print or binding of this edition, but the stories are certainly some of the best of Wells' science fiction I've read."
1,This book totally stinks!,I hate the book because it has no plot and the characters seem to be retarded. -Matt Cain
4,Great!,This was excellent. I could not put it down and read it in one night and just a couple of hours the next morning. Immediately loaned it to my principal. This builds on Teaching with Love and Logic and was exactly the next step I needed to transform discipline on the school level rather than just one classroom. Definitely recommend it!
3,A Very Good Album,"Not a great album, but a very good one. Like most of the reviewers, I found it somewhat disappointing after Just Won't Burn . This one has a much smoother, polished, pop sound to it. In exchange, Tedeschi's given up the urgency and passion that characterized JWB.However, this is a different album, and deserves to be listened to and rated on it's own merits. After several times playing it through, I've come to a rating of 3 stars. 5 stars is for timeless great albums (ABB Live at the Fillmore, Who's Next, Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt Pepper's). 4 is for great albums that aren't in the very top tier, including ST's Just Won't Burn. 3 is for very good, very listenable albums that you can enjoy over and over, but that probably won't still get pulled out of the CD collection 10 years from now."
5,Around the block,"For such a young woman, Susan has the expressions of one many years (maybe life times) older. Her voice and her music say the same thing.....to be in love is the garden of paridise and then to have it leave you can feel like a body-shot from a middle weight prize-fighter.....just when you need it so badly it can leave you alone and dead inside. Susan tells one how it really feels to be one who has been ""around the block'."
2,Move over Rover,Disappointing. Instead of this buy Ellen Mcilwaines Spontaneous Combustion CD just released recently. Taj mahal is on it and she plays mean slide guitar. Certainly not commercial like this. I still like Just Won't Burn Alot.
1,"Nope, didn't like it","Susan has a nice voice, but I never really considered her music blues. I hoped this record would go more ""blues"" style that I like to listen to. I prefer the classic blues artists like Muddy Waters and BB King. This is too 'schmaltzy' for my taste. If you like similar artists (Muddy & BB) you may want to pre-listen before buying."
5,Susan is Golden,"We did wait, Susan, and are still here to appreciate your work. This is an excellent CD, which I have played over and over after buying it the first day of its release. It has an excellent variety of tempos and types of songs. I think my favorite is one Susan wrote (to Derek I hope), ""I Fell In Love."" I fell in love with this CD -- Susan Tedeschi still rules!"
1,DISSAPOINTED,"I really loved Susan's last CD, and could'nt wait for her follow up.But I have to tell you there was nothing here to wait for,more record co. trying to make an artist mainstream so they can make more money.This CD is cold compared to the heat and passion of Just Wont Burn.Last time I buy one of her CD'S without listening to it."
1,really sucks,If you really liked JUST WONT BURN then this could be amajor disappointment like it was for me. Susan leaves the Bluesfor a smoother sound and leave's the fire and passion behind.Now there's nothing special about her. Susan please go back tothe Blues.
4,pretty nice effort,Love her voice...don't think much of her guitar playing. The producers must think the same way....because this album emphasizes her pipes..which are great.Her writing has improved. The weakest songs are the covers.Keep goin' girl. You're doing great
4,"Lacks Burn, Gains Class","Being a huge fan of ""Just Won't Burn"", I was highly anticipating the release of Susan's follow up album. I must admit, at first, I too thought it lacked that raw sound that I loved about ""Just Won't Burn"". It lacks that hard edge and has a slower tempo. This is my reason for 4 out of 5 stars. However, after a few listens the catchy tunes on ""Wait For Me"" caught me. You can tell right away this album is tighter, flows well from track to track, and has a rich soulful sound. Susan seems to be maturing and branching out as an artist, and I find it refreshing. If you're looking for ""Just Won't Burn"" Part II, you won't find it in ""Wait For Me"". Susan's vocals won't disappoint, got to love that voice! My fav tunes are Alone, Wrapped, The Feeling, and Don't Think Twice. I'm enjoying this album loads! Solid job Susan."
2,"If you loved ""Just Won't Burn"" this CD will disappoint you","I was happy to see that Susan had finally put out a new CD. Just Won't Burn is on my CD player turntable a lot. I bought the new CD the first day and rushed home to hear it. Frankly I was disappointed. Maybe motherhood and time have mellowed her out. I thought the music would grow on me, but after hearing it a dozen times it has not. Just the opposite, it is like so many other female ""POP"" singer CDs. I have put it away and been listening to Just Won't Burn instead."
2,Susan Tedeschi Lite,"I was thrilled to find that Susan had new CD out. I loved her previous CDs. Raw, rocking, powerful blues. This new release is Susan Tedeschi lite. Overproduced, cautious, soft, with little of the fire and raw emotion of her previous efforts. It may be more commercially successful but I miss the passion and kick-[butt] power of her earlier work. Her previous two CDs blew me away. This one put me to sleep. It ""just don't burn."""
3,Still waiting,"Susan Tedeschi has one of the most astonishing voices in the current musical landscape, and sadly, there's nothing on Wait For Me that stretches it to the extent the best moments from Just Won't Burn did.. That isn't to say it isn't worthwhile - Tedeschi spent the record going into more classic soul and r/b territory than finding the blues, which is absolutely her right, and with songs as fun as ""I Fell in Love"" or as lovely as ""Alone"" and ""In the Garden"", you'll certainly understand why. But for the most part, the record doesn't leave you with much of an impression, or, as in the case of ""Hampmotized,"" it can get downright annoying. Tedeschi certainly hasn't lost any talent, but this record is a subpar showcase for it."
3,"I Agree 100% with ""Just Don't Burn""","I am quite disappointed with this one. Whatever magic we all fell in love with in her 1st CD, is now mostly GONE!!"
3,A passion-ectomy?,"If you were as excited as I was about the passion that Susan shared on the ""Let it Burn"" album, then this album may be a bit disappointing. ""Wait for Me"" is mixed better that her prior recordings, but comes across as a garden variety bar blues, devoid of the gut-wrenching vocals she displayed on her earlier works, and what she has demonstrated live.I have seen Susan live twice, and was anticipating this album for some time (as the last show she covered some of the tracks). I was a little disappointed in the recorded tracks of her new material, as they did not reflect her real presence. I realize that Susan is going through some big life changes that may have influenced this album. I have seen unbelievable live performances which showcase her incredible talents. I hope that she can capture some of the passion she exudes in her live performances and stamp in on a disk some time, but until then, its probably not a bad idea, as the album says, to wait."
2,What happened? I'll tell ya',"All those wondering what happened to the killer guitar work on her first album need to realize that that was not her playing, but a young and really soulful player by the name of Sean Costello. It was a great combination... if you're a blues fan, or a blues guitar fan in particular, you'd be better off getting Sean Costello's Moanin' for Molasses. That one's killer all the way through. In my alternate universe he's the big star..."
3,She Should Have Taken Her Time,"Oh...wait a minute...she did...and in the process fired most of the band from Just Won't Burn. This cd has none of the fierce and unbridled passion and power that Just Won't Burn did. If fact it sounds like a cover of and early Bonnie Raitt album. This is unfortunate, because Suan Tedeschi is no Bonnie Raitt. Even though it was so disappointing, the 3 stars recognized Tedeschi's incredible voice. The cd is over-orchestrated. She clearly missed the presence og Tom Hambridge and Tom West on this cd. If I hadn't already bought it, I would have waiteduntil it showed up in the ... bin at a local flea market. Keep your eyes peeled...there will be alot around."
4,Very good with a little editing,"Like many, I'm sure, I was blown away by ""Just Won't Burn"". This is not that album. It is however a very good album, if you ""edit out"" the following tracks: 3-Wrapped In The Arms of Another, 7-In the Garden and 8-Hampmotized. The first two tracks are pretty little ballads neither emotionally complex nor musically compelling. The 8th track is trivial and should have been left for one of those b-side/previously unreleased albums. Anyway without this 9+ minutes of ""music"" the album becomes instantly tasty and tight, worthy of a follow up to a gem of an album like ""Just Won't Burn""."
5,more of the same (though not necessarily a bad thing),"F.E.A.R. Extraction Point doesn't advance the story or gameplay of the original F.E.A.R. much, if at all. Many of the environments are similar, if not the same. There are some new enemies, but the novelty wears off quickly. The plot simply kills more people this time around.The scare factor, though, is entirely different. Whereas the original FEAR would screw with your head, flashing apparitions and broadcasting static over your radio, Extraction Point is point-blank horror."
1,DO NOT LOAD DEMO,A demo is to show you what the game is like.I loaded it and crashed my PC.It was so BUGGY it was unplayable then it crashed my PC to the point I had to reload windows from my recovery disk.DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE WITH THIS DEMO!!!!!!!!!!.I WILL NEVER BUY THIS GAME.
3,little let down,"I completed fear 1 and found it to be exciting and challenging at times but toward the end it became predictable. With that said, fear 2 was basically the same game, several times I felt I was in the original game with the graphics and locations. Many times you seem to be teleported to a location with no real reason to be there except to take a break from the mouse.The graphics were awesome and it was enjoyable but could have been much more, if Half Life have the same graphics realism that would make a awesome game.....but you better have the horse power in the video card to handle the game. Although the video ran great, the auto game saves blips the action entirely too much.Totally worth playing but just the same old game."
3,Disappointing,"As others have said: Don't expect much new from the pack. You have a few new weapons, but the story is very weak (bordering on non-existent for the most part). I would recommend it for a $20 purchase, but at $30 it is over-priced for what you get. Expect to play it once through and never fire it up again."
5,Great Expansion,"I really loved the first F.E.A.R. and i finally played this expansion. If you loved the first F.E.A.R., then you would love this expansion. The levels are not as tedious and repeated as before and it has a heavy focus on the action aspects of the first game. Don't get me wrong though, it still has the ""OH (%*$"" moments. The story is not as heavy as the first but still good. There are a few new weapons like the chain gun, and laser gun and automated turrets that you can throw like a grenade and they will stick at any angle and help you lay waste to your enemies. It is also a decent length. Overall this is a excellent expansion and if you liked the first F.E.A.R., you have to play this game."
4,Satisfactory,"Played pretty well, as a mindless shoot'em up. There wasn't much development of the original plot. It took me 7-8 hours to finish, but I like to investigate every nook and cranny."
3,A quick knock-off of a very good original,"FEAR impressed me. Mixing a shooter with what amounts to a gothic horror story was a fresh idea. Extraction Point is a bit thin on story, more of just the typical shooter. Retail price is too much for what you get, paying bargin bin prices seems about right. Unless it changes, the next expansion installment will probably rate the same. Bottom line, loved the original, like the expansion pack, but it is too short and lacks the storyline that made the original compelling and worth the price."
2,Great for horror fans,"F.E.A.R. Extraction point was a great game except for one thing: plot. there was a very stretchy plot throughout the game. a great shooter game, and a great game if you enjoy not sleeping at night (like me)I'd have to say this game is as scary, if not scarier, than the first.my one big problem is this: the last few minutes in the game leave you with more questions than answers.if you enjoyed F.E.A.R. for the storyline, and want to find out the answer to a ton of questions, THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU. if you like finishing games and feeling perplexed, confused, and ripped off, by all means, purchase this game."
3,A good enougn expansion,"The FEAR expansion was very fun, just as fun as the original game. The new weapons didn't change the game much though. The computer AI seemed better and more dangerous. However right as your really getting into it the game just ends. This thing is just to short so make sure you play it on hard to get the most out of it."
2,No where near the original big disappointment,Extreme disappointment way to describe my view of Extraction Point.first it was way to short to finish . have spent many hours playing and the original F.E.A.R .this version took me abount 2.5 to 3 hrs to finish and at the end when you helicopter gets blown up you think your going to another level and game ends. graphic are very good. just up to par with first one.do not wast your money on this it is not worth buying not enough level like first one. To spend 30.00 on this game not worth it.look for it used if you have to have it . i am shore you will find alot of them selling on ebay and other sites. i just hpoe they come out with another expansion pack that is as good as first one
2,not payin for much,"sadly no matter how you fight it and argue. a game can be fun and look good but you also pay for something that will last you longer than a movie. face it, it's an expansion, no extra work for graphics or gameplay. so basically they just had to think up more story... that's what you paid for, for them to sit around and think up a story that only last a couple hours. no more to say."
2,Nothing new and very short!,"The game by itself is good on the action, but nothing new! The same clones and more of the weird stuff. Nothing new... I total rip off and the ending was horrible and left you hanging just like half life 2...A total rip off. I want my money back."
3,"not bad, has potetial","the Firm is loaded with great workouts, the instructors are always friendly and encouraging, although they are not always the best, but the workout is ok and the commitment to feel good is there, it could be better, but not every class at the club is good either, so take what you can get"
4,Great stuff,This is a great weight training work out. It is longer than a lot of the weight training videos I have (which is great) and the moves are safe & easy to pick up. Some of the exercises are taught with a barbell but dumbells work just as well as far as I'm concerned. There are some squats and leg lift type exercises in this video (as well as abs) also that I skip because I find them hard but the rest of it is great and my muscles feel worked and my body warm afterwards! Always a great sign of a good workout!!The audio quality is not perfect but I find it gets better as it goes along and you really just have to turn up the volume in the beginning and that helps a lot.
3,"Poor video quailty, but a great workout","The quaility of the video is not very good. My older vcr did not handle it very well. We have a new vcr and the video seems to be much better. I like the workout warm up 4 min. Weight training 39.0, abdonminal 3.0, cool down 3.0, total time 49.0. A challanging workout with barbell ,step stools and weights. The video quality could use some help."
2,"yep, terrible quality","I agree with the previous review - the video quality on this tape is truly appalling. It'a a pity goodtimes have decided against giving customers what they are paying for. As a workout, it's pretty good but because of the quality of recording, I've only played it once."
3,It was a gift for my grandson.,I bought this for a gift for my grandson as a collectible to display on his bedroom wall upopened.
3,not bad....,"this cd isnt awsome, but its not bad either. it has a few really good tracks like ""CNT"" ""Mirror"" and ""Through Your Eyez"" and like all their albums, they do some rock, but only one made it to ""Mirror Mirror"". Its called ""Alone"" and it definitly kicks ass"
2,Worst effort by Twiztid yet,"To me, it just feels like Twiztid didn't put one hundred percent effort into this one. Mostasteless was an all around masterpiece and you can tell the lyrics on The Green Book have a lot of heart put into them, but this album just comes off as flat. A lot of the material on this album comes from the scrapped Black Majik side rock side project Twiztid was working on. If Twiztid decided to scrap the whole idea, then you can bet it was pretty whack. In my opnion, the only solid tracks on this cd are ""Reflectionz"" because of its wicked sound and ""The World"" because its just a kick ass song that reminds me of the Mostasteless days. ""Dirty Lil Girl"" is pretty funny, but still sub-par musically. If you're a die hard Twiztid fan then get this for your collection, but if not, I recommend just staying away from it."
2,One Word: Horrible,"I was hoping that this album would at least make up for the interest I lost in Twiztid after listening to FreekShow but sadly enough it did nothing of a sort. I'll admit, there are a few songs I really like but after those you might want to consider changing the CD. Perhaps it's just me and my brutally honest methods of reviewing an album but one can usually sense when a musician is or is not putting there all into their music and as far as I'm concerned they didn't even make an attempt for Mirror/Mirror."
3,I Expected Better,"This is an OK cd, but I expected a WAY better cd comming from Twiztid. None the less, I'm a juggalo 4 life"
1,Not worth the Psychopathic Name!!,"Okay, first of all, I love ICP...I like Twiztid, but not near as much as ICP. Freekshow and Mostasteless were good, they did get old after a short while, but enjoyable nonetheless. But this cd is absolutely unbearable, the beats were totally uninteresting, the lyrics were bad, even for Twiztid...and, i just didn't get any enjoyment out of listening to this...at all....I'll keep it for my collection, but that's the only reason."
5,Incredible insightful look into our self behaviour,"This is a wonderful illistrated book that shows why we do and say the things we do and then ask ourselves why did we just did it. It is a great book for children with selfesteem issues, that are approching teenager or starting jr. high. It is also good for anyone wanting a visual of how the modern human group social psychology is constructed. Don't be fooled, this is a picture book not a textbook, but still quite insightful."
3,A nice coffee-table book....,"While this book is oversized, making it good for having lots of pictures, the material inside is very much a treatise into european knighthood only, addressing almost not at all middle eastern, eastern soviet, or asian thoughts and ideas.But, it does have good pictures."
3,I found Centipede to be a fun little monster flick,"I'm one of those people who like Grade B horror and sci-fi movies (even Grade Z sometimes) with non-CGI monsters. I think Centipede is actually a pretty good little movie that mixes the old style monster genre with the young-good-looking-twentysomethings in peril plot. I also liked the fact that Centipede was actually shot and is set in a non-typical locale -- the country of India. To me, it was a lot more fun to watch than the recent spate of cartoony CGI monster movies or indie sadist killer horror movies. If you enjoy the old style monster movies from the 50s and 60s like me, you might enjoy watching Centipede. I did."
3,Ive seen worse.,"Im a sucker for monster movies...and this one is not too bad.The only reason it gets a 3 star its because of the caving scencery.Caves are great for monster movies...too bad you have a bunch ofsilly humans bringing down the movie...but its not that bad, mostacting is pretty fair to good, and the monster is not too bad either. A bigger budget would have improve the situation..but itscertainly worth a viewing...."
1,********CENTIPEED %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%,"%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%This flicker just rubbered me the wrong way.It lacked centipedal force.The monster's not even CGI: Centiputer Generated Image - what there isn't of it.100 to 1 it didn't have 100 legs either, not that they moved.Maybe it should be called Pentapede. Well, ok, Octopede.Or, Onetapede, as it's in that percentage of the movie.I missed most of this film.Because I kept FF it. Yes, I said...I nearly pede my pants. Maybe because the film was that weak. Or -entipedes don't usually swim underwater.Have I learnt my lesson yet?This is the reason for being on Earth - it takes many many times.%%%%%%%%%%%%% ============%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"
4,Great Concentrated Upper Body Workout,"Although I agree with other reviewers that this tape lacks in biceps work, I would still recommend it. I think the leg movement is a nice distraction from the burning in my arms, just be sure to be coordinated enough to do both and not hurt yourself. I have many other firm videos, and this is a great complimentary video for the longer total body workouts."
3,Effective upper body workout,"I love the upper body work in this compilation video (compiled from the Firm Classics series). However, since I usually do a Firm total body workout first, I don't care for all the dance moves added in to the workout. If you have already done a full body workout you may want to ignore the leg work and just do the upper body exercises. I found the leg moves distracting so I took pen in hand and wrote down the upper body exercises and amount of sets on paper and just do them without the video. I found the instruction good, but Sandahl Bergman is somewhat cloying and Janet Jones-Gretsky's warmups may be too difficult for beginners. I've noticed all the Firm classics ""guest instructors"" tend to use dancers moves that are too difficult or too ""choreographed"" for people who want a workout, not a jazz dancing lesson and these two instructors are the worst about that. Rent it first to be sure you like it. Better yet, rent it, write down the exercises and don't bother buying it."
3,Compilation with Redundancy,"This is a 35 minute upper body workout that is a compilation made up of parts of the original Firm workouts #1-6. Equipment needed to perform the workout are dumbbells of increasing weight, a stool or the infamous fanny lifter and a floor mat.While I won't argue that this is a good, tough upper body workout, I found it rather disjointed and boring. There was very little bicep work, but an (over) abundance lat rows, pushups and even tricep work. There were very little pointers on form.For an upper body Firm workout, I prefer Upper Body Sculpt with Janet Brooks, which is a 40 minute workout that I find more balanced.For other Firm junkies, if you look at the ""class"" in some of the workouts, you'll see a young Tracie Long (dark magenta leotard) and I believe Pam Cauthers (yellow)."
4,In between full body workouts,"PROs- Good workout for the upper body and works best when done on a day between full body workouts. (My routine is full body, upper, full body, lower, full body.)- This video gives you some aerobic effect, too, though not as much as the full body workouts.- Very nice for shaping the arms, shoulders, chest, and torso.- You will feel stronger after doing this video for a while.- I like it that there are different instructors for different segments. It takes away from the cheesy factor and the boredom factor.CONs- I think it's best that, after a while, one moves on to strength training for upper body development. This is good to start with, but after a while, it simply doesn't do to be moving the legs while lifting weights. And after a while, the routine gets easy enough. Just to compare difficulty levels: Standing Legs is harder for the legs than this is for the upper body."
2,Not impressed,"I wasn't so impressed with this Firm workout. I found it went really fast whereas the newer Firm videos are a little bit slower (but still a good workout) and show you how to do the exercises correctly. Also, I just didn't like the background... there were a ton of people doing the exercise with the instructor, unlike the newer videos, and I found that distracting."
4,"A good, but not great, video for upper body","I agree with some of the reviews of this tape, in saying that the warm-up and a lot of the stretches seem kind of useless. So I skipped them, did some arm and back stretches, and then started working with the video. If you're looking for an aerobic workout or something which works out your whole body, this is NOT the video for you. That said, this is a great video for upper arms. The only two drawbacks are that it's hard to switch the amount of weight you use between various upper body muscles since parts of this go fast, and there is a lot of back (lat) work but not as much bicep work as I would have wanted. This is a great video if you want to spend 20+ min just working the upper body or want to add at the end of some kind of cardio workout. (Firm's Tough Aerobic Mix or Not So Tough Aerobic Mix would be good for this.)"
4,"Tough workout, but effective",This workout tape is great for advanced exercisers that can't find time to go to the gym. I saw results quickly. Susan Harris is very motivating.
4,Nice compilation of classic Firm videos,"This workout is a nice compilation from classic Firm videos which provides a targeted upper body workout in just under 40 minutes. It begins with a warm-up led by Janet Jones-Gretzky and then moves on to the arms work. In the traditional Firm style, many of the moves are designed to raise your heartrate while toning, so you will frequently perform simple lower body movements while working your upper body with weights. The instructors offer suggestions for the amount of weight to use and often pyramid to a heavier weight between sets. To make the transitions between the various instructors a bit easier, the workout also contains brief new segments with DePrise Brescia, who provides instructions on setting up for the next move. Some of the exercises are performed for more than one set by different instructors--namely lat rows and push-ups. Overall, this is a solid upper body workout that I continue to use as part of my regular rotation."
1,Chinese only,This product contains no subtitles or alternative audio. It is Chinese language only and pretty much worthless for someone who does not speak the language.
1,Chinese only,This DVD contains no subtitles or alternative audio. It is worthless to non-Chinese speakers.
1,This books price.....,The pricing on this book is ridiculous for a reprint. Bring the price down. Hardly nobody will be paying 100+ dollars for a book in today's economy.
5,The greatest success in zoological literature since Darwin,After 40 years this book is always the best work about cryptozoology. An immortal masterpiece.
5,a joy to read,"I searched and searched for this book. My search was almost more difficult than finding a real mystery animal; but at last I found a decent copy and spent too much on it.It was worth it, though. This book is a classic for a reason. The author presents the material in a thorough and engaging way. And he is skeptical at the right moments.I have no regrets about buying this rare book. If you're into cryptozoology, yet also have a brain (a rare combo), this is a book that needs to be in your collection."
4,Natural Humans,"As a photographer of interesting and often beautiful women, I found Jock Sturges' work both exciting and intriguing. I live in Europe but even in this social climate, the free intimacy Sturges invokes with his subjects is worth the efforts to understand this book. I would say that he evokes a natural intimacy that is usually absent from photography or the nudes shot by most photographers miss the wholesome quality evident in Sturges' images. The people are neither ashamed nor proud of their bodies...they inhabit them. I applaud his work and I will study this photos for years to come."
1,Skip It and Google Experiments Instead,"As others have noticed, the manufacturing precision just isn't high enough for these kits to work reliably. I'm sure some folks get lucky and have the bones actually fit into the mold. Not me. If I moved the back feet into position, the skull popped out. Put the skull back in, then the front leg falls off. Quite the exercise in frustration. Finally I decided to skip the bones and make an all-gel dinosaur just to have something to play with. The gel ran out the cracks in the top of the mold and made a nice horrible mess.I'd suggest thesnap together electronics kits, or pretty much anything done with baking soda and vinegar instead of this junk."
1,Junk Junk Junk,"Reading all the reviews was way more entertaining than this product. I have never written a review before this, but had to because of just how bad this product is.It's all true...the skeleton pieces don't fit together, the mold is impossible to keep together, the gel solidified too quickly, the instructions were incomprehensible. Then when we put our finished dinosaur, which had bones showing because gel didn't fill up the mold, it wouldn't fit on the stand. There was no possible way that it could.[...]. I hope the company is out of business. This thing is really junk junk junk!!!!!!!!!!! It is now in the trash."
1,From Excitement to Frustration & Disappointment,"We gave this toy to our five year old son for Christmas. The package was marked ages 5+. Our son easily snapped the skeleton pieces together and was jazzed about getting the mold done. Unfortunately, this part of the project is not for ages 5+ or even for ages 37+! I struggled with the mold (dinosaur bones kept falling apart), then my husband struggled, then I struggled again, put it away for the night, and struggled to finish the next day. Of course, the five year old totally lost interest. The instructions for mixing the gel were unclear (put both packets of gel powder in with one cup of water or one pack for one cup of water?), so we ended up with a mess, and the gel didn't properly cover the bones-- even after all that work. We've put the second dinosaur project away for another time. Wonder if we'll ever get motivated to complete that one!"
1,garbage,Do not buy this product. Does not meet any expectation as described. It is flawed in every possible way and only delivers on disappointment. I will never buy anything again from this company or it's affiliates.
4,"Well written, but what's it all mean??","Certainly an intelligent and authoritative look at the Beatles music, but a bit dry and technical. Still, interesting, even if it's a bit difficult at times. I wouldn't say it's a necessary book, but it's nice to have."
3,It's ok for very large drumsticks.,The spaces between the wires are quite large. So smaller drum sticks will not stay within the wires.
4,Better for Legs than Wings (See Customer Photos at Top),"You'll note on the packaging that there are no photos of wings hanging from the rack even though it is called a ""leg and wing rack"". Ditto for the manufacturers website.I'm not sure how you could completely load the racks with 12 wings without them sort of laying on each other sideways. I bought two racks and was able to space out the 18 wings I cooked.That said, the wings came out the crispy and like fried without being fried, in part thanks to a spritz of pam-type cooking spray."
4,Good for drumsticks,But I want to bake duck legs once and the ducks obviously have smaller knuckles. So it didn't work. Great for chicken though
5,Best CHICKENSTICK grilling tool there is!!!!!!!,"Not much else I can say here. I have been looking for a way to better enhance my grilling of drumsticks and a friend turned me on to this and I haven't looked back since. Perfect in every way. I have found that if i put a pan with water under it, makes the chicken even more juicy. Must have!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not entirely won over,"I purchased this CD on the power of the two semi-radio singles I had heard. The remainder of the album is not bad, but never manages to rise above what I would consider the average singer-songwriter fare. There's not a lot of urgency to be found here, with most of the tracks settling into a mid-tempo stroll. Penn, who conjures up the Beatles, and sometimes a touch of They Might Be Giants (I don't know where that comes from, but I thought it was TMBG the first time I heard his voice),is winning but never really asserts himself.This is a review for those of you who have not listened to Penn in the past. If you have, you know what to expect. If you have not, try to find it used."
5,A Great Accomplishment,"One of the best examples of combining great writing with a specific theme that I have ever heard. It's hard to do but Michael Penn has done an amazing job. Aimee Mann, ironically, did this on her last album with great success and this is even better.It leaves you with so much more than just great songs and production. While it does have both of those elements, it has an added depth that you just can't find in music anymore.Thanks Michael!"
3,"Penn is back, but not better than ever","This is a great album. It has several tracks that really impressed me. Still, there's something missing here. Mr. Penn's earliest works had a brooding quality that is certainly present here, but they also just flat out rocked. Musical themes came and went at breakneck pace, and the sound of the early albums was ritchly layered with found sounds and jangling instrumentation. Since the incredible ""Resigned"", Penn has seemed to prefer to use simple rhyme shcemes and slower pacing. The writing is still clever, but a cloud of depression has descended on his work, and it does not seem to want to let any sun through.If you loved MP4 you'll definately love this. Penn's wicked tongue lashes out with clever lyrics and bitter choruses. His guitar lines are still sweet, and the pace is brisk. I would have prefered more of the angry young man who first caught my ear, but this will do."
4,Great Concept Album,"This is a great album. The first two songs are fantastic! A bit depressing when one considers the concept of the album. I would have preferred a bit more of Michael Penn's trademark guitar, but you have to take into consideration what he is trying to get across with this CD. This work shows the depth of M. Penn and his songwriting skills. A good buy for anyone not too impressed with the current music scene. Hints of the Beatles."
3,"Good, but we waited 5 years for just THIS?","I liked the new album, I did...I have everything Michael did since March. I can only describe this album as MP4...MArk 2 but slightly better. After waiting though for 5 years for a new album, I figured Michael would be doin much more than we he's issued here. His songs are sounding exactly the same as they did on MP4, which i liked but thought could have been better. He needs to rock out more again....too many slow songs. The problem is that whenever he produced himself, the results aren;t as good as with other producers. Tony Berg and Brendan O'Brien were GREAT for him, but as soon as he starts to produce, or co-produce, as he did on Free-For-All, the results seem lacking a bit. Stick with other producers Mike, seriously."
5,Good internet modem,I bought this product at the recommendation of Earthlink (Internet Provider)It turns out to be most reliable and good performance.
3,"Good idea, just needs more spice","I recently watched Christmas Evil for the first time, and I didn't love it, but didn't hate it either. I thought it was a really good idea, but there just wasn't enough happening. Nobody is murdered until the 2nd half of the movie, and even after that, I can only remember one other killing. For a slasher movie, I think more action & violence would have been in order. But still, the acting was pretty solid for a ""b"" movie, and the killer's dimentia was well done. I liked the film well enough to watch it again at some point. I bought this movie as part of a Horror Classics set at Best buy for $6, you get several other movies with it, so if you want to watch it for cheap, that is the way to go."
1,Nor Naughty nor nice just bad,"If you are looking for a little holiday horror to counteract all the jolliness of the season, don't bother with this. ""Christmas Evil"" is nothing more but a collage of scenes trying to pass off as a horror flick. The film really doesn't have any defining plotline to speak of and the motives behind the killer aren't all that apparent. The trauma he goes through in the beginning is pure nonsense and hardly makes for a springboard to start the story. Three of us watched this Christmas gunk and all three agreed it was a waste of time. The only funny parts were when Harry was writing in his little books of naughty and nice but a few scenes of amusement doesn't make up for a badly plotted and poorly executed film. This is heading back to the RETURNS department very soon. F"
2,christmas evil? um don't think so,"saw the bloody knife on the cover and figured there had to be plenty of victims. wrong! try black christmas or silent night, deadly night for some christmas classics. this movie is a classic piece of ... will have to admit that the acting is there but that's about it! not an entertaining flick. nice try troma but don't think so."
1,Christmas Evil,"I am a great fan of John Waters, and have enjoyed most of his movies very much. I was intrigued to find Christmas Evil on his website, and on reading the synopsis I thought it would be much to my taste. The DVD arrived today, and having sat through it, I found Christmas Evil to be the biggest movie disappointment of my life. Although not a John Waters production, I thought that having been endorsed by him, this would be a good black comedy, with at least some of the campy dark kitsch that is John's trademark. What I found was just unbelievably and embarrasingly awful, and lacked just about everything that would have been necessary to deliver what was suggested. Imagine the worst B-movie ever, but produced by an eight-year-old, then extract anything approaching humour, and you have Christmas Evil. I sat through it with fellow Waters fans and at the end I had to apologise to them. Beware all true John Waters followers: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!!"
3,Evil Santa,I Thought Christmas Evil Was A Very Good Horror Movie.The Movie Starts Off Pretty Slow.But Once It Got Going It Turned Into A Great Slasher! The Only Thing The Movie Needed Was A Little More Gore And It Be A 5* Movie!And If Decide To Buy This Dvd Get The Troma One Because You Get The Original Cover!Which Is Awesome Looking.
3,Lights out !!! A fine performance Brandon Maggart.,"Really the only reason to see this film is the riveting performance by Brandon Maggart as Harry. His slow decent into madness, caused by crushed Christmas dreams, is played out to perfection by the veteran actor. Comparisons to 1984's ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" are inevitable but there really are no similarities other than the crazed man in a Santa suit. Look out for Harry, as his eyes haunt you in the dark and while you're dreaming. This one stays with you long after you watch it. A must-see psychological thriller."
2,Not Quite 'Evil' Enough,"Christmas Evil has a low body count and is more like a drama with a few kills thrown in so that it could be sold as a horror movie. For a better Killer Santa flick, check out Silent Night, Deadly Night or Silent Night, Deadly Night 2. I would also recommend the episode of Tales From The Crypt titled ""And All Throught The House"" from Season 1."
4,Satisfying in the end,"This is my first Wambaugh book, and I read it because Michael Connolly speaks highly of his writing. Although, by the end of the book, I was thoroughly involved with the characters and enjoyed it enough to give it 5 stars, I resisted and gave it four because it was very slow at times. I would have to compare it to episodes of Hill Street Blues, which I loved. It isn't an exciting, page turner. It's the day-to-day lives of men who started out at the police academy together as rookies. I also used my rule of thumb in giving it 4 stars. I did not immediately buy another of his books. I will read more by him, but I am currently reading Vince Flynn."
4,Early Joseph Wambaugh,"Read this book years ago and wanted to revisit the story again. Pleased to say it still stacks up as a good read, it is about a group of men training to become police and the things that follow. Enjoyed it."
3,Slow going for me.,"After thoroughly enjoying ""The Choirboys"" I plodded thru this one.There is no doubt it is extremely well written with some strong characters.As I am fan of the fiction mystery novel, perhaps it was the more true crime aspect of the book that caused me to lose interest.Certainly I will read more of Mr. Wambaugh's books, but I will be careful to assure myself it leans to the fiction side. It's for sure he's a wonderful writer...I just caught the wrong topic.KVD"
5,The other side of this controversy,"For the ""other side"" of the highly controversial Warren-led Sino-USA Upper Yangtze River Expedition, read Bang & Kallen, Riding the Dragon's Back (1989, Athenium). This is a highly readable and an exciting account of river rafting the rapids of the upper Yangtze. This video is an excellent companion to Bang & Kallen's book."
4,"in truth, untested, but great winter reading!","got this book, in part, to try and gauge how big problems would be with some used boats we were looking at. covers lots of ground and I've seen his work reproduced in some other books we have on the same subjects, for what that's worth. it's a great way to get some armchair project time in over the cold winter months!"
5,replaces several other books,"I don't have the space for every reference ever made, so this is a very good composite."
5,Sailboat Maintenance on Amazon,This book has lots of great information in it. We're new boat owners of an older sailboat and doing some fixing up and repairs. A great addition to our collection of boat books!
5,A great book for even the newbie,This book has not only the needed information but great illustrations to aid in boat maintenance. Also has information on inspecting and surveying boats before purchase.
4,Good classic Maugham,"Well written book about a South Sea adventure seen primarily through the eyes of Dr. Saunders. The book has philosophical passages that are Buddhist in nature and make a lot of sense. It is also a suspenseful mystery. Maugham expertly compels us to care about the fate of all the characters. The writing is fluid, descriptive and it moves at a good pace. Maugham himself has written better books (Razor's Edge etc.) but his writing is still better than anything out there today"
1,Amazon SNAFU Listing,"Buyer Beware! This listing is an Amazon SNAFU which combines a track listing for an album by ""The Johnny Boy"" with the album cover and band description of ""Johnny Boy"" duo/band. It is hard to say which product you will receive if you purchase this though most likely the one described in the track listing. This is solely a comment on this botched listing.Bad Listing Robot! I even submitted a correction and the listing correction robot responded but denied that there was a problem."
3,Just Okay,"This toy is only about half the size of our Buzz Lightyear action figure. It is about 6 or 7 inches tall. The blaster only shoots out of the top chamber. Our Buzz toy is so full of features, about 10 to 12 inches tall, and with articulated arms, legs, hands, and feet...it makes this toy seem like a Happy Meal prize. Buzz has buttons that makes him say several different phrases and has laser blasting sounds, but this Zurg toy doesn't have any sound at all! The way you shoot the blaster is you pull his head up until the neck is about 6"" long, then slam the head down! Kind of dumb. If they had put as much effort into designing this Zurg toy as they did with the Buzz toy, it MIGHT be worth the $[...] they're asking for it. As it is, you're basically just paying for the ""Disney"" brand name. I was not impressed."
1,terrible junk,junk This toy was nothing like pictured and it does absolutely nothing its a piece of trash actually we blew it up on new years eve!
1,WAY Overpriced,"I just received this toy to give as a gift for my 3 year old grandson. It is way overpriced at [...] for the toy I received. It is a small action figure only 7"" high and shoots Nerf darts. I think a 3 year old could do just as well with one that doesn't shoot them at 1/3 the price."
3,Great service,The toy arrived in pristine unopened condition and was delivered very quickly despite choosing standard shipping. I was very pleased with this seller and would not hesitate to buy from them again.
4,Purposeful,My protective cover was extremely useful in covering my rooftop patio furniture. I do believe it should have a little weight on the ends so that it doesn't come up when it's windy and the furniture always remains covered completely at all times.
4,Protective Covers 1125 Weatherproof Cover for Wicker Furniture,"I purchased these covers for a 2 seat and 3 seat wicker sofa and they seem to work great, so far. I like the velcro tabs that attach to the sofa legs, great for windy days. They are water proof and sun deflective, which is what I need living at the coast. Also, they are very generous in size."
5,Another Great Purchase,"Great sturdy cover for outdoor furniture. Was very impressed, especially for the price I paid. They are nicely sized to fit over loveseat easily."
2,Not meant for sunny weather,"It cracked and dried out in the short amount of time that we had them. Unfortunately the PHX sun beats the ever living life out of things, but if this was rain and snow resistant, I thought it would be able to handle the sun too."
2,Protective Cover,"For the price, the cover is thin with an undercover of fluffy material. The water goes right through it and I know I would never buy another one like it. The color does not fade but gets dirty easily from the air pollution. Pillows were all wet underneath the cover."
4,"Great Covers, So Far......",So far I am very pleased with these covers. They do the job and do it well. The thing I do not know is how they will stand up against the heat of our Arizona summers. My furniture is located under a lattice so the sun is somewhat blocked. Only time will tell.
1,Not Waterproof! ZERO STARS,"DO NOT BUY THESE COVERS FROM PROTECTIVE COVERS, INC. THEY ARE NOT WATERPROOF! DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS AND THEN HAVE THEM ""DISCOVER"" RIPS ON COVER SO WARRANTLY COULD BE VOIDED. ALL WILL LEAK LIKE A SIEVE FROM THE DAY YOU RECEIVE THEM."
3,Really good workout.,"Okay, so basically the only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I thought the instructor, Pam, moved between exercises very quickly. And really this was only a problem for me, I think, because this is the first ""older"" firm tape I have used and I'm not quite used to the flow yet.Overall though this is a really good workout. I have used older videos (ingeneral, not FIRM) where the exercises are un-safe and dated, but the ones in FRIM Strength are the exception. I have been a dancer all my life and ""thought"" that my legs were very strong. But this workout had them burning (in a good way) like nothing before! If you try this tape, I can almost gurantee it will become a favorite!"
3,ok shower curtain,It is ok but wish it had magnets on bottom and is starting to yellow for me so not too impressed with it
2,Skip this yawner,"I had several problems with this movie when it was first released:By then, Fonda's fitness guru image rendered her ludicrous for a frumpy role such as this one. I didn't buy it, and, apparently (judging by the b.o.), no one else did, either. As she quickly learned, you can't have it both ways.At the time this movie was released, Barbara Bush had made literacy her pet First Lady cause, so the timing made the whole production feel like a trendy bumper sticker.Who can watch DeNiro refer to someone as ""Iris"" and not be distracted into thinking of ""Taxi Driver""?I can't remember much else; I was probably asleep."
4,A Recommended Nice Story,"Here's a so-so romance/drama that has a satisfying ending and a generally nice feel to it. It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family film but considering it stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a lot rougher movie, at least language-wise.The most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult. That's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes.I like the realism in here and I definitely recommend it."
1,The Emperor (Deniro) Isn't Wearing Any Clothes,"I feel like I'm in the story the Emperor's New Clothes. Am I missing something here? I saw this movie when it first came out and I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen. I love great movies and I even love horrible movies such as the film The Room. Robert Deniro is one of my all-time favorite actors but I have never been so bored in a movie theater as I was watching this film. The irony is that I love films about people's struggles and I'm usually the one who likes movies that the critics don't like. That being said, I just don't understand how anybody other than the man and the woman who this story was based on could have enjoyed this film."
2,It's okay...,"I was flipping through the channels at home and I came upon this movie. What interested me was that Robert DeNiro played a man that was unable to read and write. I am a special education teacher that teaches learning disabled students. I thought that the movie could teach them how important reading and writing was in every day life. I think that for this purpose the movie has served me well. The story, etc. was okay. 8th graders were interested enough to watch it through."
4,Stanley and iris,Always enjoy films with a great storyline and good acting. This film is one I enjoy over and over. Cant go wrong with Robert and Jane.
3,a movie worth watching...,"One night, I was watching television and Stanely and Iris was just beginning.. so I sat down, relaxed and watched it. I never heard of this movie before (i haven't seen a lot of movies).. and I was intrested to see Robert De Niro play this role in this type of movie.. After watching this movie, i really thought it was a nice movie to watch.. it was entertaining.. it wasn't an awful movie, but it wasn't the greatest movie ever.. it is a good movie to watch when your by yourself when you feel like there is nothing to do.. because you can just do what i did and relax.. get confy.. and just watch.. And if guys are reading, its a good movie to watch with your girlfriend lol"
5,A wonderful primer for creativity and new possibilities,"Sometimes it seems that every self-help book is 20% content, 80% inspiring stories. Mapes has reversed this ratio, filling his book with a rich and practical array of how-to-do's.Quantum Leap Thinking concentrates on those areas that most trip us up: fear, lack of motivation, risk-aversion and self-imposed limits. These topics are treated in an easy-to-read style, with easy-to-follow guidelines.If you're interested in personal change, this is a must read"
5,A staple for self improvement,"James Mapes has a knack for getting the ideas across, and the best part is that the ideas are relevant."
4,Cute and warm,"This little sweater is very cute and looks a whole lot more expensive than it is! It runs true to size, the scarf is adorable and the cable knit is very rich looking. The only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is that it has the leg hooks for the rear legs which my guys hate and if you cut them off or don't use them the sweater will ride up on their back."
1,T193-Stinkin Battery,"This phone is horrible. It takes 4 hrs. for a fill charge, and it goes dead in an hour and a half. I can't wait till my contract is up, so I can get a new model phone. Thanks alot, Motorola."
1,Does Not Hold Charge,I recently purchased the T193 phone. The battery worked well for about 6 months. Within the last month the battery has been not holding its charge at all. I would plug the phone in at night before I went to bed and when I woke up it would say it had a full battery. I would then make a 30 minute phone call and the battery would say it had only one line left? I just had to order another battery because the battery wont even power up the phone anymore. I am very upset that motorola would put out a battery that did this. I am on the other hand very pleased with the T193
1,Terrible Battery,"I am in agreement that this battery is terrible! I thought that I had done something wrong in my charging of the battery, but after reading all of these terrible reviews I realize that these are defective batteries. I like the phone, but the battery has made using the phone an unenjoyable experience. I say all the customers who purchased these batteries were shafted by Motorola because they are no longer making this line because they knew they were [junky]."
5,Solar POWER!,The watch is solar powered and has atomic time keeping.The battery also lasts for a very long time .
5,Great Watch with the correct time always.,"This is my second Casio GW500A watch.The first, which I have had for many years, needed a new band after being abused with many chemicals and UV from the sun. I decided to buy a new one rather than just the band. The old watch still works perfectly, always with the exact time, due to the atomic feature, and never needing a new battery, due to the solar charging. It is probably 12 to 15 years old. Before I retired a few years ago, it was constantly subjected to strong magnetic fields, harsh chemicals, vibration from air and electric hammers, and other abuses that industrial maintenance offers, but still worked perfectly. I would highly recommend this watch."
1,This watch sucks!,"This is my third Casio atomic watch. I like their accuracy when they actually work correctly, but when they screw-up they are worthless. This my latest Casio watch and came with an operating manual you'd need a microscope to read. If you could read it you'd need to be a brain surgeon to understnd it. Casio is not kown for their dependable watches, and this one is a pain in the ass to set-up and use. I've had this watch for about a month. As you can tell I'm bummed, because this watch went belly-up twice in the past twenty-four hours. I would not recommend this watch to anyone who actually wants a dependable wrist watch. Atomic time is a great idea but worthless without a dependable watch to use it. Casio just aint it."
4,Very Sturdy and Accurate,"This watch is great to have and is indestructible. I banged it against my desk to see if the glass would shatter or anything else would break. It didn't. The automatic time calibration is good, but will only work in certain locations. The manual time calibration is hit or miss and that's why I gave the watch 4 stars. Overall my experience has been great."
2,Not Good,I bought this thinking about the daily update to a nuclear clock and solar power to have a watch last longer than four years. This one lasted about four months before it stopped working altogether. I wouldn't buy this watch again.
2,Great up until now,"Got this watch about a year and a half ago. Worked great up until about two weeks ago. I started noticing the display sometimes was ""asleep"" when I got up in the morning, but it would come back to life quickly when exposed to sunshine, but it's gotten progressively worse to where now it's dead every morning and needs a couple hours of sunshine to come back to life. I'll be replacing it with a battery watch."
4,Atomic watch,"I have been waiting a long time to find a watch that will keep the correct time. Atomic clocks as well as watches have been out for a while but have been too pricy. This watch appears to have all of the good stuff plus it is solar powered. At first I had a problem getting the time zone corrected regarding day light savings time, but once turned off (I live in Arizona). everything is great."
2,Unable to charge the GW500-1V G-Shock,Researching all the reviews concerning this item I thought the watch would be exactly what I wanted BUT had a nagging thought in my mind about the reliability of the solar charging system vs a normal battery. Unfortunetly my fears were correct and after a few days of wearing the watch and leaving it in direct sunlight for hours I still can't get the battery to remain charged over night without the display going blank and the charging indicator blinking. Only after leaving the watch sitting in the window and the display returns can I wear the watch until it goes blank again sometime in the night. I am now in the process of going through the return procedure and sending it back for refund. Probably just got a bad one but don't want to take a chance again..
5,me and my watch,I have owned this watch for over 12 YEARS now and i have only had to just now replace the wrist strap for it. I am very hard on watches and it is difficult for me to find one that holds up for more than a year or two so i am very impressed that it has held up. yes its big but so are all G series that last any amount of time. The bottom line is this thing will take all the punishment that you want to give it and still love you in the morning.
1,Battery Life is Awful,I purchased this watch in July 2012 by December 2012 the battery would not hold a charge. Before buying this watch please read the people who rated this watch with one or two stars. You will save yourself money
5,Great Watch at a Great Price!,This watch is built tough and wonderfully crafted. The look and design is understated in the picture. The watch will last for years. I have a number of Casio watches and never had any problems.
5,GREAT WATCH !!!!!!!!!!,"I've owned mine for 3 years, and it is still going strong.It's a little pricey here, but still worth buying.These watches, to borrow Timex's phrase, do ""take a licking and keep on ticking. "" Thanks,and may The LORD bless and guide you."
4,Terrific Watch,"So far, an excellent value for the money. Solar cell easily charges watch even with indoor flourescent lighting. The watch arrived with the battery indicator at ""medium."" Within 2 days, it was in the ""high"" range and hasn't budged. I live well west of the Rockies and the atomic clock signal has no trouble reaching the watch to sync the time. Very comfortable band. Even though the buttons to change functions are flush with the casing, they are large enough for my fingers to use even while wearing gloves. Recessed crystal is also a nice feature."
4,Nice digital watch,Nice watch. The time updates each night from atomic clock signal. The left most round indictor is rather useless... not a funtion I would use. Great value for an atomic solar watch.
5,Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch,"Best watch that I've owned! This is my 2nd one, the 1st one is probably being worn by someone in Myrtle Beach! After I lost my watch on the beach, I arrived home and promptly purchased another one. The old watch, I had to replace the battery once. They don't tell you how long the rechargeable battery lasts but it lasted for about 4 or 5 years before I had to replace it. Ordered it online and replaced it myself for about $15.00.Otherwise the watch is very reliable and highly recommended by me.Buy one today, you won't be sorry!"
5,excellent watch/great value,I have owned two gshocks previously and I know that I can rely on the gshock line to provide an excellent product that is durable and reliable. I would say that if this is your first atomic/solar model that you should actually skim the owner's manual for a few tips on when the watch syncs up to calibrate.
2,Maybe a defective unit?,"Received this watch for my birthday yesterday. It looked great and fit well. I was impressed with the quality of the display and liked the solar charging feature.However, after going for a 2 hour paddle in the ocean yesterday, the watch stopped working. I thought it might have needed a recharge (though it read full charge before the paddle) and have kept it in the bright sunshine for 4 hours today with no hint of a charge. It also had fogged up, hinting at a non-watertight case. I am sure it was a defective unit, so I'll update the review once I have a new unit to evaluate."
5,Best time keeper and most durable.,"How could it be better. -with solar, atomic time, solid case, reliability. Only caveat looks, but that is personal. BG"
4,Great Value,"I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. He was quite surprised and pleased by the Atomic solar features and replaceable watch band. The watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts. Overall, very pleased and a great value."
1,Don't buy this in the winter,"I bought the watch in November, the battery was fully charged. That lasted a week. Sitting it in a window for a day only charged it for a few hours. I left it in a window for 2 days and only got 6 hours. So it's looking to me like I have to wear it a week and charge it a week, which is pretty useless. Casio says that it's not their problem."
4,Nice!!,"I have really enjoyed this brand for years and I just had to go back to it again. I really enjoy it!!! Not the easiest to set, but its ok"
4,comment on Casio G_Shock watch.,"Some would describe this watch as ""clunky"", a matter of personal preference/taste.When I received the watch the battery showed less than fully charged, however when exposed to sunlight, it soon charged up and has stayed there since. It receives radio time signals without problem. I now and then check it via Official U.S. Time on the Internet. It is always dead on.There was one problem with the watch, at the end of Daylight Savings Time, last fall, the watch did not revert to Eastern Standard Time, as I thought it should. A call to Casio Service resulted in my sending the watch back for repair. The problem turned out to be a bad battery, which Casio replaced. The watch runs fine, and provides exact time, important for navigational use."
3,Great watch. but............,the band fell apart after about 5 years and Casio no longer sells replacement bands.Replaced it with a #MTG930DA-8V which seems to be the same watch with a metal band.If the band lasted longer I would've rated it 5 stars.
1,Casio GW500A-1V G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch,"This watch charged & held the charge all day for the first month, now doing the same as when it was new it will hold a charge for about an Hour to Hour & 1/2"
3,good but battery problem,My son really love this watch and wear it all the time. The problem is that during the winter the watch does not get enough sun light and sometimes lost all power. Even after we charge to medium it will be out of power in a few hours. I took it out to the full sun for a whole day when my son was in school. The power was full in the end. But the next day the power became medium again.
2,Battery is a problem,"I love this watch, but there is a problem with it. I bought my watch about 10 months ago, and the battery is already dead in the morning when I wake up. Not too impressive. I will look into how much a replacement battery costs. 2 stars cause it has great feature and looks great. An $80 watch should be problem free for longer than 10 months."
2,CASIO G SHOCK NO TIMER IN THIS WATCH,i RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS CASIO AUTOMIC SOLAR POWERED WATCH AND WAS VERY EXCITED BY THE AUTOMATIC TIME KEEPING FETURE. iT IS AGREAT WATCH BUT DOES NOT HAVE A TIMER BUILT IN WHICH I NEED WHEN WORKING OUT FARTLEK RUNS AND IN BETWEEN SETS. iT HAS A USELESSS FETURE OF RECORDING TIME OF EVENTS WHICH I AM NOT SURE WHY ANYONE WOULD ACTUALLY NEED THIS WITH OUT THE DATA OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPPENED DURING THOSE 30 RECORDED EVENTS? wISH CASIO WOULD PUT A TIMER IN IT GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO A TIMEX IRONMAN LATER.
5,Great Watch,"I read about this watch and was a little worried as to a solar watch and how long it would hold its charge. But i am very glad i purchased it, i really like my new Casio atomic solar watch."
5,awesome watch,This is an amazing watch at this price. I have received the watch in 4 days after ordering and found it amazing watch. worth the money spend & it has become my main watch which i wear daily.
5,Tony,"This is one fine sports watch, It is everything that the mfg. says it is I am very happy with the watch"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought this watch 4 years ago. It is an atomic solar watch that is supposed to NEVER RUN OUT OF POWER. About 6 months ago the watch began to only charge to medium power and then would completely die after about 8 hours! Casio uses a cheap solar cell for these watches and will not admit to this problem or just replace the watch. Casio will make you either pay $90 for service fee to replace the solar cell or you just have to buy a new watch. This is false advertising and this watch is not worth the money. I suggest you buy a better watch with a battery. When the battery runs out after a few years it will only cost you about $10 to replace a battery. Casio should be ashamed of themselves, I have worn a G-shock of one type or another for almost 20 years, but this is blatantly false advertising and I will NEVER own another Casio product. Citizen makes a fine watch."
4,Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW500AJP-1AV,"I should have gotten the model with larger, easier to read numerals on the watch face."
2,Great watch bad wrist band and battery's don't last,What gets me mad is that Casio knows there wrist bands give out in a year or two and do nothing to fix this problem...For years it has been this way...Use a cheap grade of plastic so they crack and break and you have to spend 15 dollars to get a new one if you can find one...JC Pennys and some other stores do not sell these watches anymore due to the fact they break...There wrist bands and battery's don't last...I got the 5 year warranty at Pennys and every year I have gone in to replace the battery's and wrist band for free...Even though the watch is solar there are battery's inside and they don't last worth beans....The watch eats them up...The watch guy told me that they are a money magnet...If you like spending 25 a year to replace the batterys and wrist band then get this watch..Solar means nothing you still need battery's and after they recharge a few times they won't charge anymore and the watch will die in days..
1,Was great for 6 months,"I have had the watch for about 2 months and it is everything a solar/atomic watch could be PLUS it is a G-Shock.4-6 months later now Oct 12, watch just freaked out, says it is totally discharged. Shake it for a few put it in daylight and it shows near full charge???!!! Think this MAY be fluke. Going to get another. I live with my watch on, depend on it hourly 20 out of 24 hours."
5,Best Gift!,"Just what I was looking for. A watch I can wear when I work out and when I'm coaching. Looks great, too, for a sport watch."
5,Great Watch!,"Great watch. I have had this watch over a year now. It's practically indestructible. Never needs winding, never needs a new battery and never needs to have the time adjusted -- what more could you want.My first G-Shock watch lasted 20 years -- I had to replace the batteries twice, but eventually it fell apart. This watch seems way more indestructible than the last one I had and I'll never need batteries. It's the perfect watch for someone who doesn't want to have to worry about a watch."
4,Superb Watch,"I have owned this model of watch for over 7 years, I have gone through 3 wrist bands (they are about 30-40$ to replace), the batteries seem to go bad after about 7 years (for me), but to replace the batteries you have to take it to a retail store, hand over the watch, pay ~65-70$/they send it to Casio for replacement due to the sealing of the case and was told will take 3-4 weeks before it comes back. For that price it makes more sense to just by a replacement here for $75.In terms of cheapness and bang for buck, this is the best watch on the market in my opinion."
5,The best watch for a good low price!,Once you read all the manual it is easy to set the watch to your exact time. Some people are just so dumb I can't believe their reviews. It's a great watch with all my requirements met. I especially like the fact that I don't have to buy a battery for it. I hope to have this watch for life.
4,Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch,Lettering in instruction manual is tiny making it very difficult to read. The operating instructions in the manual were poorly done making the directions very difficult to follow.
5,Great Product,"after buying this watch, I was very impress with its performance and a must have for anyone"
4,Great features,This is a good watch with great features. Like the atomic accuracy feature. Just what my son wanted in a watch.
5,Casio wins again!,"I bought this watch for my husband. He has a dresser drawer full of watches that need batteries. Some don't keep very good time either.This Casio watch is Solar powered so it NEVER needs a new battery. It has a Atomic Clock setting that receives a signal 4 times a day from the National Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins Co. so it is ALWAYS perfect time. Accurate to 1x1,000,000 of a second a day.! WOW!!Great deal on a great watch! Oh, I almost forgot...showers with it on too! Good to 600 feet deep! Shock,Water resistant and Solar power with Atomic timekeeping. What the heck eh?Buy One be happy!!"
1,SOLAR battery dies in a few years,"All of the good reviews must not be from people who have owned tough solar watches for more than a few years. The solar batteries in these watches tend to die after ~5-7 years and can no longer be charged, so the watch becomes worthless unless you have the expensive battery unit replaced, but that defeats the purpose of the solar battery. It would be cheaper in the long run to just buy the non-solar versions and replace the $5 batteries every few years. I feel like the solar gimmick is a scam by casio. Although the watches themselves hold up well and have good features, DO NOT buy SOLAR unless you expect to replace it in a few years."
1,Hard to set due to small print instruction booklet.,This watch has several problems. The dials on it chew up space for anyone to read the time and other info. Ok if twice its size. Get one w/o dials. Use a good magnifying glass to read instruction booklet or Casio has to double its size of their instuction booklet. Other bad mark is its shaded face or dark glass. I'm informing Casio of these problems as well. Its buttons are hard to press or do their job. Overall not worth it. 20/20 vision won't help.
1,Watch does not work,The watch quit working about two weeks after I received it so it was a waste of money. I will try to return it to casio.
3,A trip to the Coast killed it!,"I love G shock watches. I have three that I wear weekly. This watch was purchased about 7 years ago and I was very happy with it. After 6 years though while on a trip to the coast i noticed that there was moisture inside the watch case. I never abuse my watches or subject them to any type of torcher that you may see on youtube. I just wore it everyday, and once a year to the coast. I was very dissapointed that the seal had failed. With sea water now in the watch I decided to just replace it with another G shock. I just didnt think that coastal waters would kill this watch."
3,WWatch Strap too short,"We ordered this watch for our son for Christmas thinking it was a good deal, but when he put it one, the strap was too short and we were left with no options to correct the problem. I wouldn't do this again."
4,Met my expectations,This is my second Casio Atomic Solar Watch and it is exactly what I wanted. Not as bulky as my other one and feels comfortable on my wrist. A smart looking watch.
4,Casio watch,"Very good product, I recomended it to every day and any ocasion. Insurance is a clock for his belt adaptable, comfortable and lightweight. Its energy efficient design is what I like to have a watch that will last a long time."
4,Love these watches,I love G Shocks. I got my first one in 1999 and it was stolen when I left it on a sink at work in 2001. This will be my fourth. They take all kinds of abuse but I have not had one last more than 5 years (assuming the stolen one is not still running somewhere). My last one was this exact model purchased at a big box in 2007 and it just stopped working one day. I put a new battery in it and it worked again for a few months. Now it works intermittently. I'm looking forward to the new one arriving and I'll be buying another G Shock when it quits five or so years from now.
4,An excellent history,"This book is very much as advertised; it provides a thorough but not overly dry history of the Church in America. It moves along at the right pace- not too much in depth but certainly enough to give us the events which shaped the development of the denomination here. Those who want to explore more can refer to the many references in the extensive bibliography which is provided at the end of each chapter and at the end. It is all well organised. The writing is seamless between the two authors which also makes this a smooth read. The biographies of the prominent figures in the church are also brief enough to provide an overview of their respective contributions. My only criticism of the book is with the biography section- they are all ""early"" figures (17th, 18th, 19th century) and none of the recent notables that we today might be- or should be- familiar with. All in all, you will learn much from this book.R. Hager, New Jersey"
3,Only an average read,This is only an average book. It really only spends a few pages on recent history. Half the book is about historical people associated with the church.
4,I like my Skechers Women's Bikers-Spokes...,"I am a big fan of Skechers because they have so many different styles of shoe-they are really diverse and creative with their products.I really like this model of shoe a lot-it looks cool and it is extremely comfortable for light walking. I got the white/red/black pair.I am giving this shoe 4 stars instead of 5 because while it has good cushioning in the heel, it is pretty thin under the toes/forefront of the foot. You can feel everything if you are walking on a non-smooth surface.The straps are velcro and quick to open/close, yet secure which is a positive. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the looks of this shoe from strangers and aquaintances alike.I certainly would recommend this shoe strictly for fashion reasons, not for atheletics."
3,Skechers Bikers Spokes review,Not a very comfy shoe. After walking in them at work my arches were very sore and tired. Not a good sneaker to wear if on your feet a good part of the day
5,astonishing,I've been exposed to beautiful music all of my life and yet I've never heard anything that comes close to Horner's work in Legends of the Fall. No cd has ever moved me as this one has. It is by far the most beautiful music I've ever heard.
5,A true legend that never falls,"This is without a doubt the best James Horner score i've ever heard. This is also some of the most beautiful music i've ever heard. It is a lavish, sweeping, romantic, and delightful score. ""Legends of the Fall"" is a breathtaking theme that really is gorgeous and phenomenal. ""The Ludlows"" contains a wonderful string theme that also is breathtaking. Some action music can be found in ""Samuel's Death"" which contains some sad and ominous parts in it as well. Alfred's theme which is introduced in ""Alfred Moves To Helena"" is a more sorrowful string theme than the other ones, but still excellent. ""Revenge"" contains the Japanese wood flute, the shakuhachi, that Horner uses a lot in his scores. The last 2 tracks finish off the soundtrack wonderfully with the main themes soaring into the heavens one last time, leaving the listener breathless. This is a score that will always remain at the top and never cease to anything less. An extraordinarily beautiful and epic score."
5,The nerve of the Soul,"No music has ever touched me like this album--I have had it for years, and I think James Horner has written the most beautiful pieces of music--music that touches the nerves of your soul. He brought this music from another place. It makes me thankful for ears and hearing--- and to be aware that there is a person who can pull this kind of music from his soul and have it so deeply and dearly touch mine--soul searing."
2,a bit more realistical rewiev of the soundtrack,"Well, for starters it annonyes me a lot that almost every critic here give the product always five stars. I'm not about to preach for that subject, don't be afraid...As a classic music enthuasist and anyother good music lover, I think this soundtrack definetly doesn't deserve five stars. I must say that I haven't watched the movie, but this is a quite a boring and poor music. It's very classic movie soundtrack with almost played only by violins.The composer of this soundtrack didn't got the courage to try and make something special and unique, and the result is in my opinion a very flat, easygoing and poor classical violin music, with not a single characteristics in it.It's not all so bad as might get the expression from this, but it's a very mediorce. And there are much better soundtracks available to buy, like ""Braveheart"" and it's sequel ""More music from Braveheart""."
5,Words Hardly Do Justice to This Music,"Absolutely georgeous soundtrack. This is without a doubt one of James Horner's greatest pieces that nicely compliments the actual movie. Every track keeps the listener spellbound, allows them to relax, and fully concentrate on the music. I highly recommend this to everyone."
5,Absolutely GREAT music for a GREAT film!,"Legends of the Fall, has become one of my favourite movies. James Horner's music helped for that. Although I don't have the CD (I'm from Greece and I can't find it!) I loved the music! It's absolutely great! I would give anything to buy this CD. I also have many movie soundtracks (including Horner's score for Titanic) but Legends of the Fall...is something else. I recommend this CD to every music fan out there."
2,A 300 lb Coat Rack?,"Quickly, I expected more for nearly a grand. The table isn't flat, it's nearly impossible to get the blade to run vertically (if it's centered on the top wheel, it's off on the bottom and vice versa), no matter what I do there's still a very slight grinding sound, dust collection is wholly ineffective and the cheap steel stand isn't sturdy enough to control vibration. And don't forget, this baby comes ala carte...you need to buy a fence (budget another $100 for a disappointing aluminum Delta fence that doesn't adjust enough to compensate for blade drift). On the plus side, the motor has plenty of power and the blade tensioning device is very handy. I guess the real acid test is that I only turn to this tool when I can't make the cut another way. I guess that says it all. I should have spent a few hundred more and bought a Laguna."
4,High Quality Saw but Poor Quality Control by Delta,"For some reason the top wheel on my saw scraped the rear metal hood both on the top rear and near the middle. I corrected this by buying another washer and putting it behind the wheel. There were also a few bolts missing and the rear (plastic) blade guard was warped due to sloppy assembly at the factory. I took this off and straightened it with heat.Bottom Line: Now that these headaches are out of the way I'm very pleased with everything about the saw and have no reason to doubt that it'll outlast me by many, many years. I highly recommend this saw but only give it 4 stars because of the problems mentioned above."
2,Wheels not in plane,"Delta tools have really gone down hill. I've had this saw for over a year now and while it is adequately powered, the drive wheels are not in plane. In other words, the blade does not run in the center of the upper wheel when it is centered on the lower drive wheel. Instead, it runs on the front. This causes the blade to come off the wheel alot and that destroys blades. There is not enough adjustment on the alignment mechanism to get it to even run on the center of the top wheel because it binds against the cover. This seems to be a common problem with this saw, as other reviews mention it. It's like there is a washer/space missing. Wish I had my old 16"" Delta back that was 20+ years old. Summarily, don't buy this saw."
1,Parts Mess with Amazon order 28-475X,"I ordered the bandsaw via internet on March 11,2005. When it arrived it was missing the TABLE! After frequent jerking around by Amazon and Delta, a table was finally ordered on April 5, which arrived around the 24th. I finally had time today to complete assembly only to discover the trunion components that attach to the table are missing. It's Saturday so obviously no one is answering phones, but the message states Delta is consolidating warehouses so no parts orders can be taken until after May 2.Out of curosity I checked the flatness of the table, which is off .03"" in 18"" from right front corner to left rear -- so it is marginally useful in any case."
1,Delta 28-475,"After seeing one example at Acme Rents, I wouldn't buy one. An unknown quantity are cast in China and imported here. I wasn't impressed with the finish of the table as it had an ground edge. I brought a used 28-212. Don't waste your money on the new Deltas, spend it on older Deltas.Delta will not learn until its too late."
4,I Beg to Differ. . .,"Having read the only review online of this saw, I was a bit reluctant to order. I ordered anyway to keep my shop ""pure Delta.""I had the saw shipped 3-day Fedex so that it would be delivered by a truck with a lift gate. Total shipping weight was 280 lbs. Take away the 20 lbs of pallet and cardboard, and what's left is 260 lbs of saw, far more than the other review said it was.My other concern from reading the sole review was the flatness of the cast iron table (how can cast iron be out of flat unless it was machined that way or run over by a truck?). My table was as flat as I can measure with my machinist's rule. . . . in no place can I even slide a piece of paper under the edge.Now I'm waiting for the free mobile base to arrive before I assemble the saw, or it will never be moved again. I look forward to completing this review with sawing details once I get sawing!"
4,Delta bandsaw,"The 28-475X I have replaced an older Craftsman. When I first turned it on and ran a test piece through, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It is a nice running machine. Handles resaws without a problem in maple, ash, walnut and cherry. Assembly is straight forward if you follow the instructions step by step. If you are going to do resaw, spend the extra dough and get the riser. I looked long and hard at the Powermatic when buying this, but in the end the ""Made in the USA"" label, the lower guide arrangement and the fact that most of my shop is Delta made the difference."
4,This is a well made saw!,"I bought this bandsaw and hauled it to my basement shop. It was well packaged so there wasn't a scratch on it. Assembly was straightforward. I bought a mobile base with it so it was assembled directly into the base. I could lift all of the pieces myself although the upper assembly is heavy and you need to be careful. The saw runs smooth and I have cut thick maple for furniture legs and resawed several log pieces without a problem. Blade tracks fine. I put on the after-market ceramic guide blocks since their advertising seemed to make sense about running cooler with tighter tolerances to the blade. A fine product all-in-all. If you're like me and have wanted a bandsaw for years, you'll be happy with this one."
3,Let's forget about Ramey for a minute...,"Most of the previous reviewers are either lamenting Sam Ramey's decline or hailing him as a legend. Let's dwell on the inovative program NAXOS has given us. Many new to this music can use this disc as an introduction to the complete works. Some will only care to have it and go no further. The live concert takes done in a three day span are competently played and warmly recorded. Did anyone mention that Liszt's ""Mephisto Waltz""(orchestral version)is included? Most other recordings include alot of duplicate repetoire. Though made at the twilight of his career(Rec. Oct. 2000, age 59), Mr. Ramey dose his devilish best to bring the whole thing off. After all these years he has made these roles special in a cool collective style. The informative program notes will guide you through. Add a star if your a die hard Ramey fan or if your inspired to run out and buy the complete sets."
3,Vecchio Ramey,I am so sorry to hear that Cd...because Ramey was my idol...He was the king of the opera world...He was the one who has the best technique....but this cd made me shocked...This old swinging voice....Arghhhh....I think Everyone have to quit the job at the peak of their careers...I want to remember Ramey as the 1991 Mefistofele....not with this cd...beyond all these words Ramey is still Ramey if we don't count this CD...The old performances makes me forget about it...I hope this will be the last fault of him...this recording must be rated with 1 star but three stars are for the brightest star of the opera world...
4,Alternate Uses,"Perfect for our needs. While we did use the peppermint leaves for cooking, we also used it in outside doorways to keep away unwanted pests (mice) who dislike the smell."
3,Important Note About Titles In Set,"Several reviewers have written about this setSpaghetti Western Collection, referring instead to the 44-movie Spaghetti Westerns set from Mill CreekThe Spaghetti Western Collection. That is an excellent set, however the set under review is a 14-movie set [the titles are listed in the editorial]. Several of these titles are also in the Mill Creek set, and there is another, 20-movie set of Spaghetti Westerns The Best of Spaghetti Westerns. In the Tradition of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" that gives a completely different selection of movies. Compare each set before deciding which one[s] you wish to purchase."
2,Mostly a Trudge Through Some of Scriabin's Music,"I had heard good things about Severin von Eckardstein's playing and looked forward to this CD of piano music by Scriabin. But I have to confess that von Eckardstein's playing here seems more dutiful than on fire; the latter is what Scriabin requires and there are any number of pianists who can do that -- Horowitz, Hamelin, Kissin come to mind. Von Eckardstein plays all the notes, it's true, but the emotional temperature rarely reaches above medium cool. The Third Sonata is workmanlike only. The Eighth Sonata, here lacking its intensity, seems merely a collection of notes. The Preludes are 'correct' but without the music they contain.Avoid this one.Scott Morrison"
1,Waste of money,Let me start by saying: beware of 5 star reviews. I will bet $ the guy who wrote that is a friend of the company. The problem with this formula is the miniscule size of the capsules. They are really tiny. Perhaps the ingredients are useful but not in the quantity provided. Waste of Money!
3,Great Naturalness of Language for This Mystery of Old China,"Nice short mystery. You'll be grateful to Van Gulik for giving his characters, from Sixth Century China, such a naturalness of expression. You'll never be bored by forced idioms, just as you'll never be asked to sit helplessly by as obvious differences between that culture and ours get exploited to the realm of the cliche (for instance, Judge Dee's three wives actually get along and are a natural part of the plot). Trouble is, the plot's a bit pedestrian when all's said and done -- a very formula production (as, let's admit it, are most mysteries)."
5,AUDREY AND JULIE,"This is another good sample of MANCINI's music.Among the highlights are ANDY WILLIAMS's MOONRIVER and CHARADE;JOHNNY MATHIS's DARLING LILI and WHISTLING AWAY THE DARK;PATTI PAGE's DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.All those songs written by the great JOHNNY MERCER.MANCINI was a master in his field,the JOHN WILLIAMS of the previous era.The music of MANCINI will live on way after you and me have passed out.Fans should also check out the SARAH VAUGHAN songbook devoted to MANCINI."
2,booooooring,"I thought this workout was pretty boring- you march & march. Leslie is very irritating, too. If you're just starting out or are limited in the kinds of activity you can do it is probably pretty good (if you can turn the sound off.......)"
2,"Does Leslie Sansone ever ""stop"" talking?","I gave this two stars because I believe this would be a great workout for senior citizens just getting back into exercising. Never in my exercise video experience, have I heard anyone talk so much ... I thought I was going to lose my mind! There is not one scrap of creativity in this workout, and I can't believe she has millions of these on the market!In all fairness to Leslie Sansone fans, I'm sorry to be so negative, but buyer beware: You might want to mute the sound on this video at all times, and use your own music. I don't believe this video would be ""appreciated"" with veteran exercise video users who like the Firm, Kathy Smith, Jane Fonda, Tami Lee Webb, and Karen Voight ... this video would NOT be for you."
5,Walk Away The Pounds 3 mile walk,I love this DVD. It is perfect as the aerobic portion of your workout plan. Less than an hour to do and you can modify to pick up intensity. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,A good -- not an excellent -- workout,"An earlier workout tape, this one doesn't offer the 1, 2, 3 mile options of later Sansone DVDs. Still, a good low-impact workout with optional handweights, moves along at a good pace."
4,Great workout!,"For the first time, I think I get why some people like to workout and it's thanks to the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs. After about a month or so of doing the 1 and then the 2 mile programs, I just started the 3 mile workout. Oh my. I was dripping with sweat the first time I did it.The usual features that make this series great for me are still there. I'm not the most coordinated person, so I personally love the fact that she uses fairly easy, basic, repetitive moves. I also don't have a huge area in which to workout. This can be done in a small space. I also love that you can adjust the intensity up and down (either with weights or with some of the movements).A few caveats: it's harder for me to find a 50 minute block of time to exercise; and some of the lead-in to the moves could be better. Also, as others have pointed out, the stretching afterward is inadequate. The chatter does get annoying very quickly, but I just turn the sound down."
4,Good Workout with some sore muscles,"This was my first ever Walk away the pounds DVD and I really enjoy it. I had no problem doing the workout. After doing the DVD for about a week I am feeling soreness in my lower body I guess the workout is working. As you are doing it you can feel your muscles working. The DVD does require 2lb weights. I bought 3 lb weights so I just do a little less reps. In other reviews I read people said that Leslie talks a litle to much, I agree. But after doing the workout a few times I can now do it while I watch TV. The workout is also a good length at 49 mins. Overall I really enjoy the workout, I think if I keep at it I will notice a difference."
4,Love it!,"I love this video. Have been working out with it since January of this year. It was the first (cardio) home video I ever purchased that I felt really got my heart rate up and made me feel great afterwards.Lesie is chatty but I like her, she is down to earth and encouraging. I will definitely invest in more of her tapes at some point. Oh yeah, and her tapes are low impact so easy on the knees which is good for me. This is good too because you can use weights (hand weights or her weighted balls, I just use hand weights) with the video if you want or opt not to. It's nice to have the option!"
4,"good workout, great vibes from Leslie","I really like this DVD. I think the workout is too easy as it is, so I kicked high, squatted low, and carried five pound weights throughout--but this just shows how wonderfully adaptable the workout is for all needs,levels,abilities. It is a great way to work up a sweat without both feet leaving the ground at once (hard on the joints).The production quality is excellent, and the class members' collective attitude is really wonderful, upbeat, and genuine. I think I got my money's worth on this one."
5,Get ready to sweat,"I work out occassionally, and bought this as something to do at home when I didn't want to go to the gym, but I wanted to do something. After doing the full routine last night, I can tell you, it's well worth the money.She keeps you moving with simple steps, and you can work at your own pace. If you are new to working out, I suggest starting with a one mile tape. I love it, and am looking forward to buying more dvds from her series."
4,"Excellent Workout, but......","I really enjoyed this simple, but exciting and energetic workout. It felt really great to get to the 3 mile mark, and I didn't even realize the time passing. However, I would've liked a bit more stretching at the end. My muscles were very warm and pliable and the few minutes of stretching really didn't satisfy me. If I had more time (I've got 1 hour budgeted into my schedule every day) perhaps a nice yoga workout afterward would be nice. Being the busy girl that I am, a 1.5 to 2 hour workout just is a bit much. Anyways, if you don't mind only a bit of stretching, this is the workout for you. For me however, I might go with the 2 mile (35 minutes) workout paired with a shorter yoga or pilates dvd afterward."
4,Great easy workout.,"This is a great workout, especially for someone like me tha has to take it slow. Walking is the best exercise for anyone - anytime. This video helps to make workouts seem much easier than stressing to get any thing done."
4,Great for beginners!,I just recently started exercising again so this tape is great for the out of shapers like me. I would rather walk outside but when it gets over 100 degrees this tape comes in handy. I can see where it would get a little boring for some people. I agree with some of the other reviewers. It does get a little cheesy in places but I do recommend the tape.
4,The weather outside is frightful -- the DVD's delightful....,"Normally I prefer outdoor excercise, but in upstate NY, it could be months before I feel like walking outside. This was a great start to get me doing winter walking.... but after a while you know every comment Leslie or the walkers are going to make. Later I got the 3-mile for abs just to mix it up, but now I feel I need more variety. The DVD's are in addition to an evening excercise class, so it's a good balance.The drawbacks? not enough stretching in either one. Not enough people even close to my age (63) and there are no ""chunky"" people in either video."
4,Easy But Effective,"I've always been one to enjoy ""tough"" tapes and ended up buying Leslie's DVD because I needed some that were just cardio. I was pleasantly surprised. Her DVD's are easy but they make you sweat and the time goes by very fast. I've been recommending her DVD's to friends of mine who aren't in an exercise routine. I think it's great for beginners or for supplementing an existing routine."
5,Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds Super Fat Burning 3 Miles,Leslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds - Super Fat Burning - 3 MilesI received this item in pristene condition and in record time. Thank You.
3,Great exercise - quit the blather!,"The exercises on this video really work up a good sweat, but I wish Leslie would stop the incessant yakking and keep her mind on what she's doing. Telling us we're going to do knee lifts and then doing kickbacks throws everyone off. And saying ""just a few more"" when she means anywhere from 12 to 42 more repititions is ridiculous. Stop the commercials, anatomy lessons, and stupid talk and give us more on form - and more silence would be nice, too. By the end of the tape I'm ready to strangle her."
2,"Does Leslie Sansone ever ""stop"" talking?","I gave this two stars because I believe this would be a great workout for senior citizens who have never exercised, or who have been away from exercising for many, many years. Never in my exercise video experience, have I heard anyone talk so much ... I thought I was going to lose my mind! I was just hoping to get an easier video to do very early in the morning one day a week. There is not one scrap of creativity in this workout, and I can't believe she has millions of these on the market!In all fairness to Leslie Sansone fans, I'm sorry to be so negative, but buyer beware: You might want to mute the sound on this video AT ALL TIMES, and use your own music. I don't believe this video would be ""appreciated"" with exercise video users who like Kathy Smith, Karen Voight, and the Firm. This video would NOT be for you."
2,Very boring workout.,"I can't understand the rave reviews of the other people. I guess if you've never exercised before or do not live a very active lifestyle this tape would be okay. I was given this tape and didn't even break a sweat into the third mile, not to mention I was bored out of my mind. What's with the ""walk, walk, walk, walk"" talk! On the positive side this tape is a good start if you have not exercised in a very long time or if you are having a ""lazy"" day. Otherwise, go for something that can get your heart rate up. P.S. You are not really walking, you are doing low impact aerobic moves."
5,Good Workout!!,"I love this workout, it's a challange, it's about 49 mins. long and you have the option of having weights involved, I use 3 lbs weights. It made me sweat and I could feel the burn in my arms and thighs, if you like Leslie's workouts you'll like this one. I workout 5-6 times a week and I can sweat good with this one, it's simple to do, VERY easy to follow and no complicated footwork. She's a very ""happy"" Person in all her videos, but I'd rather listen to her any day over Richard simmons (gross)! Anyway this is a good buy for those Cardio days. My hairdresser used this workout for 3 months and lost 15 lbs without following a strict diet so this is why I tried it. I know I'll lose weight with this workout it's awesome. Try it!!"
3,Love the workout but hate the editors!,"The workout itself is good, with only one minor miscue from Leslie where she announces knee-ups and goes on to do leg lifts. The editors though did not pay careful enough attention to right leg or left leg on which beat, meaning you constantly find yourself having to shift stride throughout the workout. Not one of my favorite Sandstones for that reason."
3,GOOD WORKOUT.BUT HARD TO STOMACH,"I have Leslie's Walk Aerobics tape for people 40+. It is easy to follow and gives one a good workout. But Leslie is too chatty and irritating. I have finally gotten use to her on that tape, but this one will take a little to getting use to, also, for the same reason. The group is also too chatty. It's a bit of a distraction. I don't think one should be annoyed when exercising. But Leslie sure is annoying!!!"
5,Easy Choreography!,"I love all of the ""Walk away the pounds"" tapes but this one is my favorite. I like this tape because you get a great workoutbut you don't have learn a bunch of complicated routines andpatterns to do the tape. With this tape you can work as hardas you wish. The cues are very clear and easy to follow. Themusic is non descript but not anoying. The participants in thetape have a variety of body types and are not spandex princesses.Leslie Sansone is a bit chatty on the tape but you can't helpliking her. I think it is very refreshing to see an aerobicsinstructor who is fit but has body flaws like the rest of us."
5,"Fun, easy & effective.","I have used all 3 of the Walk Away the Pounds videos. Its great to be able to choose between a 15, 30 or 45 minute workout, depending on how much time and energy you have. I love using the walk away weights, as well. I have lost weight, and trimmed inches, as well as toned my arms with these videos. They are much easier to follow than most aerobic videos, too."
3,Could the walkers please be quiet?,"This is actually a good workout but I found the walkers to be a little too talkative. It's one thing to make some noise so Leslie won't think she's talking to herself...or to drown her out bacause she can be rather chatty...but to make comments throughout is not necessary. And could the walkers please spread out some? That cramped look really gets to me! I've only been able to stomach this one one time and I've had it over a month now. Can you say ""yard sale""?"
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"I started collecting Leslie's 3 mile walks & ordered this because it used weights. It was really a pleasant change from the other dvds because there are different people,different music and a different workout area. Also these are 15 minute miles which is slower than some other dvds so you can actually use the weights appropriately. She uses her own brand of 2lb weights but any weights or no weights up to 2 lbs will be fine to use. If you have the other workouts I say go & seek out some of the older ones. They add some change to it. Unfortunately I have to say that the tracking on the VHS tape was a little off but it was new and this could be due to age and my machine. This came very quickly too much faster than they said."
5,I'm 71 and I love it!,"Leslie makes me want to do my walking, even if I don't feel like it at first. Her enthusiasm is catchy. Turning on the TV and staying home with Leslie saves me 20 minutes each day over driving to the Mall and walking there. The two miles go by quickly. I'm so glad to have this DVD.--Old Lady in Utah"
1,Do Not Buy,You get what you pay for. This case is of the poorest quality. The color is an ugly pink which looks like pepto bismol and it was actually stained inside. I would send it back but that wouldn't make much sense. I threw it in the garbage. I will only buy products from Blackberry for my Blackberry device.
4,Great buy,"I would recommend this case. It's secure for my phone, and I like that I can adjust the clip to be horizontal or vertical. The flap with the magnet is a little stiff when I want to pull out my phone, but I like that it is pretty secure. Can't beat the price, either!"
2,I returned mine,"It Would work OK, IF (big if) you have someplace to glue all the pads to hold the phone & speaker is place, and IF you didn't mind all sorts of wires snaking all over the place & blocking your vision. For now I""ll stick with the earphone/onwire mic that came with the phone: It sounds pretty good, receiving & transmitting, and it's less messy. And I'll search for a ""handsfree"" car kit that's more compact, where you don't have to spread the speaker & phone out all over your dash."
1,Best looking paperweight I own.,"Absolutely the best looking dock out there. Brilliantly designed... it fit in with our stuff perfectly.Although it still looks great, it started shorting out within the first year. At first I thought that it was only the part where the iPod and dock connect, but after a while the light on the front started blinking randomly and I realized that it was more serious. And once it begins blinking like that with the sound cutting in and out, you no longer have control to turn it off, so you need to yank the cord from the wall. There's just something overall wrong with the technology itself... this thing is a hopeless mess.BUT, it's still sitting in our living room and still looks amazing. Too bad it doesn't work."
3,Number 100 and counting...,"For being Ramon Ayala's 100th release, It totally disappointed me in the sense that it really lacked linear notes. It does has some but not as I thought it would have. Also, they could've added some photograhs of his early days and also could've put his discography. I gave it 3 stars for those reasons, the songs are OK bbut could have done better on some of them."
3,Entertaining if a bit cheesy,"Just in time for Halloween, I started on this novel. The first part, which discusses the activities of various Michigan paranormal associates, was not of great interest to me. Some of it was downright hokey and I was glad when I got past that section. Once past it, though, I really enjoyed reading about the various urban legends and ghost stories that are tied to cities around the state. I thought the gave the reader quite a feel for Michigan's history and culture and I love learning about the folklore of my home state."
2,MISLEADING VIDEO,"This FIRM tape is titled ""Sculpted Buns, Hips and Thighs"" which is ironic because AB work is mainly what you will be doing. The back of the box also lists Upper Body for 1.5 minutes. There is no Upper Body work, but the back of the box shows Tracie doing push-ups. Did they cut the Upper Body work out of the tape? Other FIRM users tout this as a very difficult tape to do. I had no trouble doing all of it the very first time and I would count myself as an intermediate exerciser. I will do the tape several more times to see if it brings about the changes thatother FIRM users claimed. Don't get me wrong. I love the FIRM but I think they need to explain the title."
4,Not that bad....,"I read where the other reviewers were dogging the tape, so I had to put in my two cents.They are correct when it is noted, the majority of the workout was for the abs. However there is a really good set for legs, especially if weights are used.I use this tape every other morning, and would recommend it to others."
4,For maximum results...,"For the absolute maximum results, by all means use weights. Albeit, dumbbells, ankle, etc. Beginners definetly move at your own individual pace."
1,Misleading,I am a firm beleiver and I love all of the Firm videos. I swear by them but this one is not what it says it is. 95% of this video is abs and MAYBE 3 leg excercies. You might as well buy 5 day abs.
3,Lightweight but pleasant telling of the Valentino legend,"If you're a romantic, in love with the mysterious man that has kept women (and some men) spellbound for decades, read on. If you're looking for a scholarly examination of Valentino's life and work, this isn't the book for you.`Valentino: The First Superstar' is a lightweight journey through the life of Rudolph Valentino, of whom too few decent books have been written. The author frames the bare details in theatrical vignettes, complete with all dialogue, giving a sense of drama but not necessarily of veracity. Such an approach is a suspect one; by putting words in the mouths of his `characters', the author sculpts history to his own liking. The overall impression is that of an afternoon television movie.The lack of an index and the limited bibliography confirms the book as one of amateur, not professional interest. However, if you know nothing of Valentino beyond his name and reputation, this might be a good place to begin."
4,Good book,"But, for me - was not quite as good as Rich Friends. Still, an enjoyable read for a child of the sixties."
3,Linux Admin. Handbook,"This book sucks, well for me that I'm a bigginer, but my class required it. I would not recommend it unless you know a lot about linux, and want to use it as a reference."
4,-covers the highlights and details-,"Authors Nemeth,Snyder and Hein cover the subject matter very well.LAH even tells you how to build a kernel. Even mentioned apt-get.But, they forgot to tell about the fickle nature of this packagewhen updating on certain platforms. Updated a site the other daywww.linuxfree.net and had all kind of problems with it. In allhonesty this is a pretty good 890 page reference. Well worth it'sprice."
3,Good Book with exceptionally bad index,"Yes, the book is not bad... But the index at the end is so bad, basically think that the book has no index if you plan to buy it. That's like everything in linux: it seems great but just impossible to use. :-)"
4,The Gap,"I like books that begin with a chapter, entitled ""Where to Start"". It contains good advice about what one needs to know and have to begin administration. Later chapters give an general overview of a subject then points to other sources rather than trying to be an extensive exposition for everything. Though the book is probably no longer worth full price, it is a handy groundwork reference."
5,Highly Recommended,"For those who need more than simply knowing how to add a new user via the GUI.Covers the whole gamut of Linux Admin. A lot of quality work has gone into this book, and the result shows. Everything you could possibly want to do is covered, whether it be syslog daemon config, mail server config, routing, and there are even diagrams on Serial pin-outs!!""Well done"" to the authors. A must have in any admins library."
4,Linux made easy,The Linux Administration Handbook (with its sister book Unix System Administration Handbook) is a great book for Linux/UNIX Administrators. I especially like the chapter on installing software. That was very helpful. Also the TCP/IP Networking chapter was helpful in solving a trace route problem. This is a great book for any administrator (even those who live on the dark side as Windows Administrators).
1,I gave it 1 star because zero stars was not an option,"I thought that I was buying a book--This was a sample chapter out of a larger book.There were 12 pages of ""Table of Contents"" that looked like the book might be useful. However, there were only about 70 pages (numbered 235-299). It was only chapter 13!It contained a reasonable description of tcp/ip but, the references in the chapter were to pages that weren't even in the book.The title was ""Linux Administration Handbook"". I expected to see something to help me with administrating a Linux computer system."
4,Interesting view of rating a helicopter,I bought this book because I wanted to know how test pilots evaluate the quality of a helicopter and what kind of flight manouvers they fly to be able to rate a helicopter
4,"First 6 songs are blissfully smooth, the rest is dry","For 1/3 of this Tony Bennett CD, Tony does indeed sing with the brightest smile in town: his vocals are deep, but smooth and airy, and the song selections aren't weighed down by Bennett's penchant for darker jazz. But midway thru, the inspiration seems to dry up and Bennett coasts by on mediocre music that allows us to hear his buttery crooning without much going on behind it. B-"
1,Should be a zero,"I have tried twice to read this book and couldn't get through it either time. I was determined the second time I read it to try harder, thinking there had to be some redeeming value, but if there is I just didn't have the patience to perservere. There are too many engaging books to be read."
2,Not worth it.,Read for a college Theology class. Uninteresting. She has a spiritual journey. It's just not worth reading.
3,One not two,The quality of the product is excellent. The only problem is that it's titled bridge supportS (plural). I thought I was purchasing 2 supports rather than one.
5,The Second Season of a GREAT Series!,"This is a must have for any fan of the series or serious collector of vampire media. Buffy in the television series is a capable albeit average teenage girl who finds herself not only dealing with the growing pains of being a teenager but trying to ""have a life"" while being the slayer. Through her growing pains both as a teenager and a slayer many of the issues that plague real teens in the modern world are addressed . . . and Buffy always comes out a winner. Although there is a certain amount of violence this series is a real feel good show showing a teenage girl and her friends overcoming the complexities of becoming young adults. I would highly recommend the Buffy series to ANYBODY."
3,Low image quality,"Put DVD to be seen in my new LCD TV and this season/product has an awful definition.Nice season, Buffy prettier than ever."
2,DVD quality,This is also not about the quality of the show but about the quality of the DVDThe special features (or most?)on disc 6 (last disc) do not work. I play my dvd's on my computer. When I take the last step selecting a certain special feature nothing happens and I have to stop and restart the disc to regain control again. I have tried most but not all the possible choices because I got fed up having to click through the FBI warnings and copyright messages everytime. The other disc's seem to be working fine.
4,"Buffy , a gift from Joss Whedon","What can you say but THANKS Joss !Buffy is 7 years of unique and evolving humor embeded in serious issues .There was even a symposium at a college on the series .The cast is so great that once you finish the 7 years , you may find yourself doing an annual rerun viewing .loved it , loved it , loved it !k"
1,Didn't work,"I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up."
1,a true horror movie,"very scary, how do people take this seriously, oh and she cannot act! and has the dumbest one liners in the world. call it what you want, add some gothic touches to it, but when you melt it down into what it really is, all I see is a night time soap opera. The guiding light!you could call it, as the world burns"
1,This is the best?,I was told this was the best season of buffy ever and i have to say i let the hype carry me a way. I was not inpressed with this season at all.
3,"Good season, not so good DVD","Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a solid and refreshing show which is a lot of fun to watch, as noted in previous reviews.However, the DVD quality varies significantly. Some episodes are very good, some (e.g. Disc 1, episodes 2 and 4) are transferred so poorly that the digital artefacts make me prefer watching them from VHS recorded in LP mode. The first season had its ups and downs but definitively nothing nearly as bad as this one. Makes me wonder if anyone checked the discs before replication."
3,Good show but slow season,Im still happy with this season but its a little slower and a bit boring. it started getting good the last two discs. 3 stars
4,worth it,i have been starting to buy every season i just got season two tyhe dvds are in great condition but the case for it is broken and one of the dvds wont stay in it but its well worth the price
3,They cut at least one scene without forewarning.,"I remember watching ""Surprise,"" the episode where Buffy and Angel finally do it, when it first came out. In the original, there was 15-20 seconds of Buffy and Angel rolling around in bed together. On the DVD, its been cut. Now, I do not think it is that great a deal, but two things bother me. First, in his interview about the episode, Joss Whedon references the scene and talks about how uncomfortable he was filming it. So I wonder if and when he was aware it was cut. Second, what else may have been cut from the episodes? I don't know."
3,dvd quality,"There are great reviews about the show below, so I'm rating the quality of the dvd instead. It can be better. The lighting in some episodes were so dark that I had to turn up the brighter and picture way up to see what I'm trying to see. At times, the scenes look grainy like it's been previewed many times. Perhaps the original film reels were deteriorated, or maybe the lighting director did not do a good job. Some episodes were just fine though. At any rate, if you can grit your teeth and just try to enjoy the shows then go ahead and purchase it. If your friend already has one, view it first and save some moola. Joss, when are we going to have the other seasons? Don't tell me we'll have to wait another year!"
4,so fast!!!!,I was very surprised with how fast I recieved my order. And am pleased with the condition of the item.
5,Must have for any Buffy Fan!,If you love Buffy The Vampire Slayer then this is a sure buy! The Dvd's are great quality and full of special features.
4,pretty good,"I got what I expected, just had some problems with delivery - not that quick, and there was a problem with the shipment, though that's probably more the postage office's fault than anyone else's...."
2,WONDERFUL PACKAGE - TERRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY,"This is a wonderful season of Buffy. And the DVD boxed set is an amaxing representaion of that. Superb packaging, great special effects, and cool menus. However, the DVD picture quality on most of the episodes is down right nasty. Some of them, like ""Inca Mummy Girl"" are so grainy and dark you have to laugh. Random ""night"" scenes are so dark that most of the features in Buffy 's face dissapear. I own some of these same episodes from the VHS release - and the picture quality is TONS better. I have no idea what happened in the transfer. Somebody please fix this for future releases. What's the fun of Angelus when the scenes are so dark and grainy you can't even see the sheen from his leather pants!?"
3,Great show - but BAD transfer,"I love BtVS and Season 2 was great, but the pixelation on this DVD set is very distracting, especially in dark or high-action scenes - and Buffy has a lot of both.I love the interviews with Joss Whedon and the commentaries by Marti Noxon."
2,Less than VHS picture quality,I'll admit I've only watched the first disc so far but was very dissapointed with the picture quality compared with the first season. It's very dark and grainy like an old VHS tape.
5,Awesome baby,"Season 2 is the best season ever. This is the season that I first started watching, and was impressed. Lots of great moments, the best ones are everything involving Cordy, and of course the best ep, ""Halloween,"" where we get to see Willow's sexy side - Alyson, what's your workout program like? Wow!"
5,Classic Season,"This was a great season, and a good place for the uninitiated to start. The characters all become more fleshed out and the addition of favorites Spike and Drucilla is priceless. The evil Angel storyline is possibly Buffy's finest. ""Beginings"" parts one and two can not be missed, and will leave you breathless. I remember how shocked I was with the second seasons ending, and have been hooked on the show ever since."
3,Picture Quality and features lacking,"If I were to give the second season of Buffy a rating, it would be five stars. This set delivers all of the wonderful second season. However, it's not packed with a lot of extras and the picture quality is somewhat grainy.The commentaries are interesting, but not remarkable. They don't provide the insight into the making of Buffy that I would have liked. Two of the commentaries feel almost identical, which is a shame.Sometimes the picture quality looks a bit grainy, especially in dark scenes (a problem also found in the first season dvd collection). The picture quality seems worse than recent Buffy reruns on cable tv).I'm very happy with my purchase, and I do recommend it. However, it could have been so much more since it is on dvd format. Still a good buy, but it didn't take advantage of the dvd medium like it could have."
1,Terrible video quality.,I love the show. I hate the video quality of this DVD. It looks like it was mastered with a VHS tape or maybe worse. Terrible video quality. Highly disappointing. At least I got it cheap.
2,Awful picture quality.,"I like Buffy a lot, but this American DVD- Set has an incredibly bad picture- quality. the picture ist grainy, way to dark, the colors are awful and there are a lot of compression artifacts. Someone said this is the quality it was filmed in, but this is NOT TRUE. I bought the first season here in Germany and the quality is WAY BETTER, especially in dark scenes. I bought the second season in America because i wanted to have a complete set and these sets are much more expensive in Europe, but now i know that it was a very bad decision. The second season is one of the best, but you simply cannot enjoy it with this set. Better go to amazon.de and get the European version."
4,Satisfaction,Our mentally challenged 27 year old granddaughter loves thisBuffy season. Plays it over and over and wears the set out. This is our 3rd set and it was delivered to us within a very short time and once again she is happy watching the second season of Buffy.
1,Good show-Bad discs,"I like the show, so I bought this set.Quite frankly, these are the worst quality DVDs I've ever seen. The brightness level is WAY too low, so the discs are so dark you cannot see whats going on. Also, it would have been nice if they didn't have a second of blackness where the comercials were, haven't they heard of editing? On at least one part, the actor's lips were out of sync with the sound.I was NOT impressed."
1,"Great show, shoddy packaging, horrible picture quality!!!","I doubt I am the biggest Buffy fan out there, but I am enough of one to shell out a lot of money for a Boxset and in return expect decent picture quality and packaging that won't damage when I drop it on the floor. I have had a heck of a time with two of my Buffy Box sets, mostly the packaging, but I was disgusted to discover the horrible picture quality in episodes like ""Some Assembly required"". I personally think that Fox should have their head's examined, thinking they could release Buffy fans this kind of DVD. I was so upset the quality of this DVD that I wrote Fox a big letter complaining about it. If you feel like Buffy fans deserve some respect or your just annoyed by the film transfer, then send a letter Fox's way. I have to imagine that the entire budget for this DVD was spent on the the overly elaborate 3d menu's."
5,"""The second season will have you hanging off your seat!""","Buffy season 2 is one of the better seasons. many characters are introduced such as Spike and Drusilla in ""School Hard"", and Oz is introduced in ""Inca mummy Girl."" Also this season has xandeer and Cordelia setting off sparks and Angel and buffy's tragic romance takes a turn for the worst. Giles and ms. calender also get together. This season is witty, fun and scary at the same time. It will have you laughing, crying, enthralled and NEVER bored.If you liked the first season, you'll LOVE the second season! Take it from a true fan, the 2nd. season is the Best!"
5,Josh Sabbagh,"Probably the best season of buffy season 2 has a lot oof issues. first buffy getting over the fight with the master and a few of his warrioirs who try to bring him forth again. Spike and drusilla, the buffy and angel relationship getting deeper until angels soul is taken away and she must have to kill him, secrets are revealed about Jenny Calendar, and when angel kills her, plus other normal hellmouth issues! this is buffy's hardest battle having to kill the person she loves the most before he kills her and her friends"
3,Not 100%,"There was some kind of, what I assume to be, melted hard candy re-hardened spewed all over some of the discs."
3,Buffy is hot,"Such a strange show and concept. It seems so ridiculous and stupid, but somehow it worked. Having an incredibly hot young girl play the heroine helped and having a sense of humor and poking fun at themselves also helped.Surprised this show worked, but it did."
2,DVD Quality Problem,"As some people already said, looks like this second season DVD might have some production problems. I opened the box and played the disc 1, it's of course a brand new but often the picture were macroblocked at the specific position, some are even went nearly a black out. And the audio was chopped badly so that I couldn't even follow the story. This happened all over the disc but especially in the episode 2. There is no visible scratch on the disc but I see very huge smear( I don't know if this is the right word for it). I have just seen only one disc but I already decided to claim for the exchange. I hope it will be better because I love this show so much!!"
5,The best season out of six!!!,"like the title this is the best season out of all six. It is the most funny, smart, and tragic. Its a great mix of all these things. the season starts off as a simple love season between Angel and Buffy but it soon grows into much more. When Angel has that one moment of happiness Buffys and all her friends lives change forever. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry. It surely is the best Buffy season out there."
1,never buy from them! Poor advertising and you can't trust them!,"The seller did not advertise that this item could only be viewed in Europe. Consequently, my husband had to figure out how to get some software so we could view it on the computer. This is not convienent for our family. I would never order from this seller again because I could not trust what they advertise. The product itself is fine-once we were actually able to view it. It is also a long and involved process to try and get a new one-and I don't want to let this one go before they send me a new one. Once again, it is the issue of trust. They want me to send them this one before they send out a replacement. I believe this is their error and I don't believe they would actually send me a replacement. Don't ever buy anything from them!!"
1,A great season - a lousy dvd set,"My girlfriend and I are both huge fans of the series and we were looking forward to catching season two, as we had missed most of these episodes the first time around on TV.The episodes themselves have been great so far... season two looks like one of the best for storylines. But what is with the horrible digital transfer?? The night scenes are so grainy they look like a low quality VHS tape. The brightness levels are all over the place. Without a doubt, this is the worst quality DVD transfer I've ever seen.While I credit Fox for trying to keep the price down on the DVD set so younger fans can afford it (The X-Files sets are still ludicrously expensive), I honestly have to say if the quality is going to be this bad, I'd rather lay out more money for a better picture. Buffy's fans deserve better than this."
5,This season is sweet!,"This season of Buffy is awesome. It includes some of my favorite episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer like when Angel was turned evil from Buffy sleeping with him. There is also the hellmouth which is located undernieth the Sunnydale Highschool. If there was a rating from 1-1000, I would give the second season a 1,000,000. This season includes Xander, Willow, Giles, Angel, Cordelia, The master, obviously Buffy, and many, many, more."
2,Disappointing Video Quality,"As a long-time Buffy fan, I was extremely disappointed in the poor quality of the transfer to DVD. The types of video defects seem to vary by scene -- bit noise is evident in the darker scenes, which makes the picture look simultaneously solarized and grainy. Brighter scenes sometimes appear washed-out. Come on, Joss et al, is this the best you could do for your fans???"
5,Buffy,"I love the show, the 2nd season is one of the best. Highlights are ""when she was bad"" ""halloween"" ""what's my line? part 1 & 2"" ""surprise"" ""innocence"" ""passions"" and ""becoming part 1 & 2"" This is a strange question, but for anyone who's seen the last episode, do you know what song it is that's playing in the last scene when she's on the bus? I can't get it out of my head and would really like to know who sings it"
4,Amazing DVDs with very cool features,"If you're anything close to a ""Buffy"" fan, then this DVD collection is a must have. Even if you're just getting into the show, this is a good way to get some history on the story that miracle man Joss Whedon brings to life.Perhaps the most loved season, in Season 2 BTVS reaches a peak in the series and the Buffy-Angel relationship. When things start falling to pieces, Buffy finds out who she can and can't rely on. This season has very few ""misses"" in the hit-and-miss game with one hell of a season finale.Join in the comedy, horror, and action. This season is when the Scooby gang really comes together and the show gets more varied and more intense."
5,Buffy Season 2,I have to say the Second Season was a great buy. I enjoyed watching every episode and I will be looking forward to Season 3.Becoming Part 1 & 2 were great episodes and a real highlight to the season. This is a must buy for any fan.
5,buffy season 2 dvd,"This product was exactly as listed and I have had no problems with the product. The seller shipped the product within the time specified. I have no complaints.Thanks,Tiffany Bush"
5,"So much at stake (yeah, sorry)","It's no accident that Season Two of BTVS continues to pop up first in the DVD list when one searches ""Buffy"" on Amazon. Despite the occasional lame ""monster of the week"" episode, the major plot arc of this season aims for maximum emotional damage -- with tons of brilliant humor thrown in along the way -- and it achieves it to an extent that continues to take my breath away. Relationships collapse, three heroes die, and by the end of it all, there's seemingly not much left for Buffy and her loyal Scooby Gang to work with. How they carry on is left for the remaining five (mostly excellent) seasons, but this will be remembered as the point at which BtVS first staked its claim to television immortality."
4,Inconsistent picture quality,"I have watched the first disc, and Reptile Boy on the second disc. The picture quality for the most part is great. However, some of the more dimly lit scenes are pretty bad as others have pointed out. I did not notice this problem at all with Seaon One. They were a little dim, but I just turned the brightness up on my screen to view those. However, doing the same for Season Two only allowed me to see a pixelated, staticy looking picture.I've only watched these on my computer so far and am not sure if these effects might be less severe on a high end stand alone DVD player"
1,"Great Show, Lousy Presentation","The average review, allegedly of this product, is five stars, but since the reviews came out before the product, these morons have obviously rated the SHOW, not the DVD they're supposed to be reviewing. Yes, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is one of the greatest shows of all time, but this package is a disgrace. Of the dozens of DVDs and videos I have, the DVD package of ""Buffy""'s 2nd season has by FAR the worst picture quality. Since one of the biggest advantages to DVD technology is improved visual quality, you'd think Mutant Enemy and 20th Century Fox would at least take the time to clean up the image and give us a decent product. But the picture is so bad (especially on Disc 1) that it is sometimes difficult to follow the action..."
4,Fade outs detract from DVD,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought ""Oh boy, this video has a blended presentation!"" Not so. No commercials, but they kept the gaps. Can't anyone figure out how to blend through those frustrating gaps? Fade out to black is uncouth, unless there is a story shift. Gaps aside, I thought the quality of the video was good, even though I had a little trouble reading some of the menu selections. I chalked that up to not wearing my glasses rather than poor background color selection, which may be the real culprit. Sound quality could be a bit better, but Giles' mumbling is part of the script, right?Okay, so I'm addicted to Spike and find it hard to fault his DVD debut and some of his best Buffy performances. If he's not worth four stars, nothing is!"
5,Best. Television. Show. Ever.,"The Second Season DVD of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a vast improvement from Season 1 DVD Set. The animation on the menu's are much much better. With great cemetery action, the extras are so much more better with a bunch of commentary and scripts, interviews with Joss Whedon, segments on Making Buffy monsters and other fun things to watch. Although the extras are all well and good it's the episodes that make this DVD one of the best ever.Season 2 was a jumping off point for Buffy, throwing in more dramatic situations dealing with Angel, Buffy, Willow, Cordelia, Xander, Giles, Spike, Drusilla... the whole gang.Episodes like Innocence, Surprise, Lie to Me, I Only Have Eyes For You, Passion, Becoming Part 1 and 2 are the must sees.Season 2 will definitely make you laugh, cry and scare the heck out of you! So curl up on your couch with a bowl of popcorn and a box of tissues cause you're in for a bumpy ride through Sunnydale and Season 2!Enjoy!"
5,Five Stars,"this dvd set is awesome. You can ask anyone I live with I might be obessed with the show but season two is deffinitly. It makes you understand buffy and angel's relationship more. Anyone who doesn't fall in love with this show and the characters. Deffinitly doesn't know what they are missing. Great action, drama, friendship, and love. I hope everyone will agree that is a BUFFY THE VAPIRE SLAYER fan cain't live without this show. I know I cain't."
5,BUFFY RULES NOW AND FOREVER,Sarah never lets me down with all the monsters and demons she's faced in this thrilling t.v.series I've followed since its begining -now I'm glad to own it.
1,Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season (Slim Set),I am very disapointed in this product. I was told i was ordering the slim set and got 3 very used and old 3 case set of the second season. I do not like that i was given an inferior product.
5,one of the best moments on tv,critics and fans praised this powerful season very sad every week we tune in to see buffy and angles unforchinitly doomed realisionship.
2,Doesn't make the 5 thanks to poor quality,"All of the other sets fall into the 4 to 5 stars category. An excellent show, very high in entertainment value. However the extreme poor quality of several of these discs force a reduction in overall rating. These imperfections caused too many distractions from the overall enjoyment of the episodes affected and as a purchaser I do feel taken advantage of here. It is a shame, as otherwise this could have been the best season/set of all."
5,Still my favorite season of Buffy.,It is also my favorite season of television ever. I really like the arc of this season.
5,Classic Television!!!!,"I wish I could award 10 stars!This season made a definite statement. This is what great television is all about. You'll want to watch each episode over and over. Discover or rediscover what wonderful writing it is and how amazing Sarah Michelle Gellar and all the other actors are. You will laugh, smile and cry-sometimes in the same episode. Favs-'Wjat's My Line,' 'Becoming,' and 'Passion,'"
5,amazed,very tragic season the daring second season made loads cry even critics were very very impressed
2,great show - terrible dvd,"Seasons 1-3 of Buffy are undeniably the best - the comedy, the romance, the drama! Unfortunately, the DVDs are some of the worst TV to DVD I've ever seen. The quality of the video is terrible - often grainy, and in standard 4:3 aspect. The whole series should be remastered and released at least in widescreen.Of course you don't need a super awesome tv to appreciate the show, the DVDs are definitely watchable, but disappointing."
3,Unusually bad video quality,"This set's graininess is even more noticable than the first season set, almost to the point of distraction. DVDs are more convenient, but your old VHS recordings may _look_ better.(Some people think Fox has incompetent flunkies working on this stuff. Those people don't understand the recorded media revenue model. It will become clearer to you in a few years, when the ""Special Edition Remastered Rerelease"" (with rave reviews about the vastly improved image quality) comes out and Fox gets our money again.)Still, it's an entertaining show. But you already know that or you wouldn't be reading DVD reviews."
3,"Great writing, acting -- poor transfer.","Reading reviews of this DVD here and elsewhere has been helpful. It convinced me of one thing ... I'm not crazy.Well, maybe I am crazy, but not in regards to my feeling about this DVD boxed set. The video quality is truly substandard. Now, I seem to recall reading back when the first season came out that the filming on the first two seasons was way below standard. But I thought the first season DVD set was better than this.That being said -- the second season has some wonderful stories, great acting and really is the year this show began to shine. (The 3rd season is my overall favourite.) And I particularly like Marti Noxon's commentary track on What's My Line....I just hope the video quality for season 3 is better."
3,Poor Image Quality,"I was excited to see that season 2 was going to have more commentaries and special features than season 1 did. I have not had the time to view all of the 6 DVDs yet, however, I am somewhat disappointed in what I have seen so far. After watching the first 3 episodes on DVD #1, I noticed the poor image quality, especially on episodes 2 & 3. Many of the dark scenes have very grainy pixels and look smeared and distorted. I am hoping that the rest of the DVDs are of better quality."
1,Dont get this headset,"This product is of very poor build quality. The black cap over the ear piece came off during my second use of this headset. The voice clarity is very much muffled and I need to strain for hearing as what is being said.Also it does not sit in ear firmly.I had ""Motorola 2.5mm Mono Hands-Free Headset - Black"" earlier and that lasted for 6 months before it went off. But I recommend that when compared to this.Stay away from trouble!!!. Motorola can stop this manufacturing this headset and can save their name."
2,Poor Quality,Static when you get connect and have hard time other side to hear from you. Use just for emergency. Not recomment this product!
3,Headset fine ... but wrong product being shipped regularly,"I think these headsets work fine, and are great. (Although they wear out over time). Unfortunately, this site has a structural problem with their inventory: the headset UPC code is affixed to the Motorola battery charger, and not the headset. This results in the wrong goods being shipped, which is annoying and a waste of valuable time. This company refuses to correct the UPC code problem or to visually inspect the product prior to sending, or even to answer its customer on this issue. Therefore, I suggest you wait a few months before ordering, to allow the problem to be fixed.If received, the headsets are light, functional and have good sound quality."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"This unit came with my two new v600 phones. I have the same issues with both units. Both the incoming and outgoing sound quality is extremely poor. Low volume, poor tone quality, (to the point that it is difficult to tell who is talking to you). People I call tell me to get off the headset on every call. Very disappointing quality for such an expensive and high-end phone."
3,Not bad for $5,"Does what I wanted, good sound and function. The earpiece slips out often, and there is no answerer on the cord, but its ok for talking on the couch...would not use it driving."
2,won't stay in your ear,"I got this because this seemed to be the only headset for my V60 that had a working on/off switch. Unfortunately, the earbud will not stay in my ear. It keeps falling out, which can be rather disconcerting in the middle of the conversation while driving. I'm going to go and look for something else that stays put."
2,Ear Pain,"Positives purchasing this item: handsfree while I'm driving, or walking.....Negatives: the cord is always tangled, the earpiece is to large for my ears, when I use this item for an extended time my ear hurts."
4,Good Product for people with normal ears,"I've owned the product for two months and have had no problem with it. The bud stays in my ear, and the clip, although not moveable, clips easily to the shirt/blouse collar for perfect positioning for hands free communication. I've never had a complaint from anyone on the other end of the conversation, and can actually hear better with this device than with the ""hands-on"" method. I recommend it - for people with normal size ears...."
1,Can't recommend this,The is the headset that came with my V600. I dislike it.My old Nokia headset was much better. The microphone isof very poor quality and doesn't pick up my voice very well atall. This is especially noticable in the car.
3,"works fine, but not too comfortable","I bought this gizmo after I lost my previous one, and was pretty disappointed when it came. It works great, but the ear piece really doesn't fit well in my ear. When I bought it, I didn't notice that there wasn't a spongy covering over the piece like my last one, and I'm really wishing I had looked at it more closely. It has this hard plastic covering over the earpiece that I guess is supposed to fit well in your ear, but it doesn't. Maybe I just have weird earholes"
1,VERY misleading product description,"The notes from the manufacturer on the Amazon page say you get 4 plugs plus a nylon travel pouch for your $10. In fact, what was in the package that just arrived was just one plug and no travel pouch. The plug looks like a good one, but we feel we were very much mislead by the product description."
5,Fantastic Read,Great for any reading teacher (k-8). Excellent ideas. Pictures of Debbie's fantasy classroom. It's a must for your professional library!
5,AWESOME READ,I really care about reading books that are easy to read....where the author's voice is really simple to understand. Debbie Miller made me feel like she was talking right to me when I read this. AWESOME book - one of the best I've ever read....GET IT - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? smile
5,FABULOUS!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. It is easy to follow, has great pictures and really shows the author's thinking process behind why she does what she does. I have read and reread this book, tabbed it to death, and bring it with me to school every day. I used all the strategies last year with very minimal tweaking and had phenomonal results in the ""thinking about reading"" strategies of my 2nd/3rd grade students."
5,"easy to read, helpful and insightful","Debbie Miller has to be a good teacher because she explains herself so well in her book. This book is easy to read, funny, full of information (teaching ideas, development of children and reading, classroom organization) and for us visual learners, packed with photos from her learning experiences. Really great book for any teacher looking for a reading program that builds on skills!"
5,Essential reading for teachers,"The book is essential for any teacher who teaches primary age children. Highly accesible writing style and an enjoyable read. I refer back to this book weekly throughout the year. I highly recommend this book for anybody thinking about Readers' Workshop, it will inspire you!"
5,Plant a Seed,"This is a book that I picked up as a first year teacher nearly four years ago. It is the book that planted the seed for where I was going as an educator. It is a wonderful, superior read!"
5,I now have three!,I have three of them. I use them in electronics labs and across my office desk. Works perfectly and a very functional use of space. No garage or lab would be complete without one.
5,Plug mold review.,"The unit is extremely handy andappears to be heavy duty enoughfor the space we have them in, myshop."
5,Great Power Strip,Power strip is solidly built and has good space between the 5 double outlets for any large sized plugs. I mounted it in my Snap-On box using sticky back magnetic stripping and it works great. have it loaded all but one plug.
2,Not for the intermediate to advanced user,"I bought this book to increase my FreeBSD knowledge and skills as this book is listed for intermediate to advanced level users. That is not the case. The book focuses only on the specific preferences of it's authors, ignoring many important aspects of the OS. For a person new to UNIX who doesn't have a prefered shell, editor, X client, etc, this would be a decent book to begin with, however for those of us who have those preferences get ready to read about Authors' bias against them. Further, there are several places where information is not correct at all. The index is horrible, making FreeBSD Unleashed unusable even as a reference guide. Save your money, and buy a book written by someone who knows what they're doing."
3,"Generaly good, but with many unnessary chapters included.","I think it is very good introductory book for freebsd expect the fact that there is a great amount of pages spent on the X windows system and its utilities. My opinion is that the title 'unleased' doesn't feet with aspects such as 'how to start mozilla and print' , 'gnome' , etc. I can understand the need of presenting the X window system as an important piece of the whole presentation of freebsd but I think that reference was too long to focus with. So , only for the freebsd-related staff that help me a lot I put 5 starts, and as for the complete book I put 3 stars. If those ""lost"" pages where filled with useful content and secrets about freebsd I would definitly put 5 stars."
3,Generally good,"For absolute newcomers to the operating system, I would not recommend this book. I'm somewhat familiar with FreeBSD/Unix and I knew some of the items/text in this book is wrong. Most notibly are typographical errors (typos). Examples are OK, the in-depth instruction is quite well. All of the documentation I've seen (printed, online, handbook excluded) seem to be dated. FreeBSD 4.3+ is current, and all the examples talk about FreeBSD v2, v3 and some v1. In hopes for an ""all-around"" solution, I would take this book with a grain of salt."
2,does not live up...,"The back title states that it will show how to harness the power of FreeBSD. It does not do much regarding that. There is a lot of time spent explaining things like the difference between a hub and a switch. It also does not go into depth into many areas such as recompiling the kernel. It makes a recomendation to use StarOffice, but does not even mention many of the problems with trying to get this installed.The book jumps around, and there does not seem to be a good cronological structure for the book."
4,"If you're new to FreeBSD, you will like it.","This book isn't for me.You would think a FreeBSD book in 2006 will tell you things like how to keep your system safe with binary updates, or walk you through a decent CUPS installation, or mention using OpenBSD's firewall tool. It's just the same-old same-old. There's little here that can't be learned from the Handbook or Greg Lehey's The Complete FreeBSD. And both are free. To be fair, there is new stuff here, like installing the official Sun JDK port for FreeBSD, or using portupgrade, but I expected a little more thoroughness and variation in choices in the areas of security, ports and printing. Also, I think a chapter about contributing to the FreeBSD ports tree would have been good to have.However, if you're new to Unix/FreeBSD, than I think you will enjoy the chatty style instead of the rather more terse style of The Handbook."
3,Good for installing,"This book does do a great job of walking you through the rather complicated process of installing freeBSD and it gives you enough of an idea of how to get a couple of basic services configured. However, it is woefully inadequate when it comes to administering the system once you've got it running. The section on configuring security and firewalls is surprisingly limited and many of the sections are so generalized that they're useless for trying configure anything but the most basic services."
5,Super Absorbency!,Leakage has always been a serious problem for me on my extremely heavy days. I tried the most absorbent products of several other brands including Always Maxi Maximum Protection. Those pads can get fully saturated within a couple of hours. This product is the only one that solved my problem. No more embarrasement.
2,Pretentious,"This is not a book I would recommend unless you want to read an account of one woman's Peruvian ayahuasca experiences. The writing style is flowery and repetitious and it blends personal narrative with a term paper. The author spends a significant portion of the book quoting other authors. She mentions on more than one occasion that she was an English Lit major, as if that somehow makes one a good writer. It doesn't and the prose nearly made me stop reading. To be fair, her ayahuasca experiences might be of interest to those who plan to spend some time in the jungle drinking the medicine. She pretentiously implies that her experiences are somehow more valid than others because of the diet she maintained before drinking the tea. They seem to be quite normal compared to other experiences I have heard, read, or experienced.My husband couldn't get past the second chapter."
1,Frothy Blog Writing With Little Useful Content,"I too feel this is a self indulgent and amateur work that lacks any kind of rigour or frankly much information of any real interest. The majority of the text is a first person subjective narrative about the author's ayahuasca experience/visions. I can't see how this would be of value to anyone else. However, if this is what you are looking for then this might be the book for you.If you are looking for any kind of in-depth descriptions/discussions about the process or history or usage of the vine then you will probably be disappointed.There is an amateurish attempt at the start of the ""book"" (I would say blog) to sound scholarly, but this topic is so clearly out of the author's depth. Stay away.I don't often leave reviews but this book was so disappointing that I thought I'd warn future travellers."
1,My Ayahusaca Vacation,"This book should have been titled ""My Ayahuasca Vacation or how I spent two weeks in the Amazon so I could write this book"". Frankly, her time would have been better spent back in the (remedial) writing class she attended. Since she spends so much time quoting the other ayuahuasca works why not read them?Don't buy this book, if you are interested in ayahuasca buy the two easy reading books written by Lamb about Manuel Cordova-""Wizard of the Upper Amazon"" and ""Rio Tigre and Beyond"" with forewords by Dr. Andrew Weil; these books are some of the best on the subject. Once you start to read them you will find they are almost impossible to to put down.Ralph Metzners work ""Human Consciousness and the Spirits of Nature"" is another worthy but more scientific tome.Better yet read Stanislav Grof's ""The Adventure of Self Discovery"" which deals with non-ordinary states of consciousness.Leave Joan for her writing class..."
2,ayahuasca,"Interesting for the beginner perhaps...She went to Peru and took ayahuasca several times with a small group of friends. This is an interesting story of her trip but I wouldn't call it authoritative on the subject; ancedotal maybe. Ayahuasca tourism. Not that she didn't have some deep experiences, but it's kind of a new age tourist's perspective. Difficult to describe in words, one of these journeys. Kudos to her for trying."
5,Interesting and Readable,"Started reading, was fascinated & continued to last page. Can't always say that about most books. Joan Parisi Wilcox is to be appreciated for sharing her insights and experiences with the Vine on a retreat in the South American jungle."
4,Nice item,This was a good purchase and I really enjoy using the product. I should have bought two of them at the same time.
1,broke in like 2 days!,got this this and was trimming with it and shaver always gets stuck on my hair and falls out. thinking of getting a new trimmer altogether
2,Don't last AT ALL,"The shaving heads work well while they last. But, they don't really last more than a month or so, whether using them for the body or the scalp, before the foil gets torn by raising up on one side, and then coming into contact with the blades, which rips open the foil, leaving a gaping hole, and rendering it useless.The bodygroomer, while touted as a groomer for the body, really is also extremely good to do daily up-keep shaves on an already closely-shaved head. It is like using an eraser on your scalp. It works amazingly well, and does it incredibly quickly.The heads are [...] each plus shipping [...]. Buying three of them basically gets you three months worth of shaving. But it's annoying to have to reorder these frigging foil heads all the time, since they're not available in stores."
3,Not as good as the original,It works fine but now as good as the original one that came with the original product itself. Dont understand why there could be difference between replacement and the part that came with the product originally.
3,Lasted about 3 months,Used it maybe 1-2 a week and it finally just stopped doing anything but getting trapped in hair.I see that the money comes from these flimsy replacement foils since the actual machine was so inexpensive.
1,Doesn't properly fit razor,"If you have anything other than peach fuzz the blade will simply fall out. The worse part is when it gets stuck in thick hair and you have to pull it out, ouch!"
2,"Fits BG2020, but detaches very easily","This definitely ""clicks"" into the trimmer, as it should, but it falls out when met with the slightest resistance. When it does fall, if it hits your shower floor, you'll need to spend a few seconds reassembling it. Would not recommend."
3,frequent replacement,Item does the job but is fragile...unexpectedly a hole will develope in foil with unpleasant results. Note: have replacements on hand.
4,Got it back again !,"I just ordered one since i found it in amazon, I have BG2020 and the trimmer is broken, it is the original trimmer and it's good as the old one i got with the device.""my opinion is to use the shaver foil carefully because it has a weak design"""
5,Balls feel great,"My testies have never felt smoother. My old blade started knicking the bottom which caused excessive bleeding. I'll never go this long without replacing the blade, definitely better than the one that came with the bodygroom"
5,Great product,I'm so glad they sell replacements foils so that you don't have to replace the whole razor. The foil works great & so does the trimmer. I highly recommend this product.
3,good buy,"I like the razor but the parts wear out very fast. When it works, it works well though. Ill buy it again."
5,Great Product,Leaves the skin very soft and also hair do not grow as quickly as with Razor. Would highly recommend it to people who want to get rid of body hair easily.
4,Who knew???,"I had no idea I needed to change the head on my razor. I was getting tired of the feeling that my hair was being ripped out all the time. I was also having trouble with the head falling off constantly. Changing the head helped a lot, and now I'm back to a hairless back!"
4,Bought as gift,"He seems happy with this trimmer for sensitive skin. Received promptly, and you can buy refills for the blade which is a plus."
1,Over priced.,"Over priced little piece of junk. Makes me made when I get the product only to have it break the second time I used it. which is funny because the original head did the same thing, cept not quite as fast."
2,Doesn't fit very well,Doesn't fit very well. It keeps falling off. This is my third replacement head. The first two were fine. This one is a dud.
1,Replacement trimmer foil doesn't work,"I bought the replacement trimmer/shaver foil on May 1 (received it about May 7). It won't stay in the shaver...falls right out. Not worth anything, much less the $20 I spent on it."
3,It's a decent razor but not the best,"This is a decent razor, but definitely not the best in the market. The top and bottom cutters give a close shave but the foil is not precise enough. I bought it just a month ago and its going fine for me, so I can't really comment on the lifetime of the product (Most people have said, it goes for around a year). You are not looking for a close shave, just a trimmer, this is a good one."
2,Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer/ Shaver Foil not built to last,"Though the manufacturer claims that the head trimmer/foil never needs to be oiled, they fail to mention that the head must be replaced on a periodic basis. To date, I am having to change the head about every 3 months, which happens to be much more expensive than simply oiling."
2,Here We Go Again,"This is the fourth time I have had to replace the shaver head on the Bodygrommer. The manufacturer even recommends replacing it once a year, whether it is broken or not. The price has been increasing so much and shipping charges are not going down. The next time I will probably just buy a different shaver. Filling up the landfill just to avoid expense shaver head replacements. Here we go again."
2,All these replacement heads never seem to fit snug,"This is the 3rd replacement head I bought for the Phillips Body Groom 2020. They all just don't fit as snug as when you buy a complete new unit. Does it cut and all, sure. But many times the head will pop out when you are using it. And for nearly 1/2 the price of the full unit itself, it's tough to keep justifying replacing the heads rather than just buying a new unit where you constantly aren't having the shaver part pop it."
2,cheap,the thing works great...but for a short time...the foil is substandard or something ...within two uses it has a crack n puckered out...causes scratch marks on skin...i wonder how they cudnt manufacture something more lasting n durable...also it tends to snap out while in use...can u believe that...not even a decent lock in mechanism...whush...wudnt buy this thing again n wudnt gift this to anyone for sure...
3,not the best solution,I bought the bodygroomer to tirm my back and shoulders and the biggest problem was that the blade trimmer foil would fall of very often. I bought the replacement head thniking that the head was just a bad fit. The new head does the same thing. Not a very good product.
4,Better than buying a whole new trimmer,My original head lasted three years before it fell apart. Was still shaving ok at the end. The new one is much closer shaver.The trimmer itself no longer holds the head in place securely. I put a strip of electrical tape on the plastic tabs in the trimmer which works well.
2,Are there any others on the market,"The razor lasts about a year and does not do a very good job, I am on my third one. The heads do a poor job and last only three or four times of use. There must be something better on the market."
2,Loose fitting,"The Bodygroom is great, I've bought two of them, but after a while the replacement foils get loose and start to fall out while you're using the shaver. I've now bought the higher-end Bodygroom shaver, which has a different style of shaving head, in hopes that it will last longer."
4,Buy one now so you have it when you need it,"As you'd expect, a replacement head identical to the one that came with the original product. Very useful as the thin foil on the head tends to tear after using for a while. I recommend buying an extra one to have on hand so you're not stranded high and dry when the foil tears."
2,this does not last as specified,i'm tired of buying this replacement every 3 months because it brokes in the superior part and starts to cut the skinwhy in the box says that replace every 12 months it brokes only with 3 months of use??
5,Excellent Replacement,"I am very pleased that the replacement for the bodygroom exists. Eversince I bought the Shaver, I haven't had to use any other. And it is one of my very favorite beaty accesory."
4,Did the job,"I've had my bodygroom for about 1.5 years and noticed that it started to pull/grab hairs sometimes, once I replaced the shaving head it was back to smooth cutting."
5,Replacement Head,Product was exactly what I needed and exactly as pictured. Was able to order cheapter than anywhere else and was received very fast!
5,Philips Norelco Bodygroom Trimmer/Shaver,"My 22 year old son is the owner of the referenced trimmer/shaver. He LOVES this shaver. He originally dropped his trimmer & got a huge hole in the Foil. Hence, the reason for the purchase of the replacement foil"
5,Works well,"Replacement blade works as intended. As many have said, it seems to work even better than the original. Have used a handful of times already with no problems. Came in about 5 business days."
4,Works fine.,"Received the norelco blade, put it in place and it's been working great.Some advice, don't drop it and then step on it like i did. The blade pops out and it breaks easily."
3,On The Fence,"I had one replacement foil fail very quickly. Edge inserts were separating.Seemed as if it didn't fit as securely as the one on the original unit.So far no problems with head #3, however it's only been used once."
5,no razor burn!,I love this product because I have sensitive skin and it allows me to stay smooth without the razor burn that disposables give you.
3,Doesn't fit right,"Was hoping that this replacement foil would work in my boyfriend's Bodygroom - nope, doesn't work. Sadly will have to cancel subscription."
1,Keeps falling off.,I got two of these blades recently. I have a BG2000 and these blades keep falling off every once in a while when I am shaving. I tried using the secong foil that I got and same thing. Gets the job done in the end but very very inconvenient.
3,Works OK,"My Braun 7505 works better on all of my body parts. I have no knicks, etc. with the Braun but I have had some problems with the norelco."
5,Norelco,"Not much to say about this product, other than it is great and it works perfectly, it arrived super fast"
3,Same As Original,"This was delivered pretty quick. I'd been looking for this replacement at all the stores that I could think of and didn't find it. Turned to Amazon and of course they had it ... and at a good price. I read the reviews before purchasing it and quite a few people remarked how much better the replacement was to the original one that came with the Bodygroom, so that's what I was expecting. So, I'm a little disappointed to say that when I got the replacement and tried it out, it was about the same as the original ... no better ... no worse. I didn't get a closer or better shave. Still, I really like using the Bodygroom and getting the replacement at such a good price is great."
5,Perfect replacement,Works just like the original. Perfect replacement part. Only downfall is they don't last. I'm on #4 as the foil tends to split and crack over time
5,Replacement blade,They always come sharp and ready to go. That is why I buy them from you. The price and quality.
1,Wasted Purchase,"Recently, I bought my third replacement cutter blade for my razor. It looks like the others, but it pops out seconds after using it. It's not worth returning. The quality has gone way, way downhill."
2,Replacement fails under pressure,"While I like the Bodygroom, once the trimmer/shaver foil goes bad, it is time to replace the complete body groom. The replacement trimmer/shaver foil was a waste. Once you apply pressure, it jumps out of the groomer."
2,"if you are a NOVICE Buy it, if not, Don't Buy","I have bought this book, because I wanted to extend myknowledge about pressure points.if you are a NOVICE in martial art, then this is a very good book for you because it explain in a celar and in detail,how to do what and illustrate it with a photo.But if you already have knowledge about this subject then don't throw your money away.At the end of the book there is [Appendix A: Vital Points List],which is a very nice to have, But it doesn't have any illustration that can tell you where to hit exactly.How many of you know where is in the human buddy is the [philtru], or [windpipe] or [solar plexus]."
5,"A book for Martial Artists, not sports people.","This is NOT a book for those who want a list of instructions, it is a book for those who think. I found that Rick's book has taught me to think outside the circle and to be able to put 'effective self defence' back into my art (Tae Kwon Do), most of which has been progressively taken out as some styles of TDK moved to become just sport. Like others, I have some criticisms on the quality of the publication but certainly none on the content. If you think that 'the clothes maketh the man' then this is not for you but if you started into the martial arts to better defend yourself then this is a definite BUY."
3,Pressure Point Fighting Review,"The author is very knowledgable, and very encouraging to martial artists to explore the topic further.I use the book, like a reference book. I have not read straight through it completely; however, I hope that the graphics will be more descriptive in future issues. I am hoping that the author will create a companion DVD to go with this book. Much of this book is not easy for me to follow. It requires the reader to have a great understanding of Chinese cultural definitions, terms, philosophy and qigong."
4,"Book Is Good, Could Have Used More","This book will provide you with some information about pressure point fighting. I personally think that Mr. Clark could have put a little more information, as far as techniques. But there is still useful information for someone who is serious about learning pressure point fighting. You may have to re-read some parts of the book to get a full understanding of the information, but it isn't all that bad. I would recommend getting Bruce Tegner's book titled ""Self Defense Nerve Centers and Pressure Points for Karate, Jujitsu, and Atemi Waza""."
5,Good detail!,I really enjoyed the content of this book. It's good in that anyone from any syle of martial arts can benefit from Professor Clarks approach.
2,Motorola V60 FM stereo headset,"I am VERY disappointed with this product. I bought theFM adapter to use while working out at the gym. The ear pieces are so uncomfortable and won't stay in my ears. The sound is fabulous when you get reception. Forget about using it in the car unless you like static. It is a great concept, but one that should have been researched better berfore being released."
3,Bulkier than the V60g phone itself - but it does work o.k.,"I have to pretty much agree with the Sept. 9, 2002 review by edrisk, excepting that where I live in Boca Raton, FL - reception is pretty good. But this is VERY BULKY, and as in my V60 phone review, Motorola could have given us all that FM for FREE, if it only let it be used with ANY ear-phone, even if only in MONO, instead of 'stereo'. On the positive side, (if you can get by the bulkyness), the unit automatically shuts-off the stereo and goes mono when a call comes in or is made on the phone. You can also answer and disconnect the call al'la Nokia with the mic/BOTTON that hangs off the shorter ear phone. Also, Motorola cheaped out, and did not even include a very necessary CLIP to hold the ear/mic UP, as the wire is not only very thick, but very heavy also. I used a clip from my old Nokia handsfree. Enjoy."
1,"Stay Away, not worth the money!","This FM accessory was the reason why I purchased a Motorola phone. I'm very disappointed with it. Reception is Horrible.The clip is awkward to attach to any part of your clothing. The uneven wires for your left and right ear is a joke. The heavy gauge wire that runs into the mike, then one short wire for one ear and a too LONG of a wire for your other ear.You turn your head and the short wire pulls the speaker out of your ear.My other gripe, CHEAP SPEAKERS. The speaker with the long wire slowly started to fade and sounded scratchy. The one with the short wire slowly lost it's quality within a 4 hour period. The next day it won't work at all, the speaker is now blown. And the other speaker you can barley hear out of. And I NEVER had the volume turned all the way up. This item only lasted a month."
2,"I like Broadway, but not this tape","Many people have said they think the Richard Simmons tapes are too quick and too hard to follow. I have found this true of Broadway Sweat. I like Broadway music and thought this would be a good place to vary my workout. But the tape is CHEESY. The action takes place on a theatre stage with some very colorful characters. Again plenty of stiff and goofy smiling dancers sashay their way to ""Can We Dance?"" from The King and I, ""June is Busting Out All Over"" and other assorted (and lesser known) Broadway songs. I found the steps VERY hard to keep up with. It is more of a dance tape than a work out. I don't like the Tone Up tape at all (I got them as a package set). Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Can't imagine getting a workout here!,"The TONE UP ON BROADWAY videotape suggests it is A Complete Toning. Well, it isn't complete toning. Complete implies total body and this only tones the arms.Apparently it was shot in 2000, Richard Simmons seems to have lost 20 pounds after the workout, because the cover of the tape is quite different! Not only does he look like he lost 20 pounds, he turned back the clock 20 years!The setting is Broadway, dark, theatrical, and black clothes. The workout is to be done with a CORD that stretches, but it certainly cannot give you much of a workout!It is a short video, with no aerobics, and no workout! Skip it! .....MzRizz"
2,S-L-O-W Business,"Everyone loves Richard, but this video is for those who work up a sweat walking to check the mail, or simply marching in place for a minute or two. For the seriously, seriously out of shape."
4,Better Than I Remembered,"The sixth season of ""Northern Exposure"" is where I finally tuned out, sadly. (Perhaps because it changed nights of the week?) I bought the sixth-season DVD more in an effort to round out my ""N.E."" DVD collection but I have this somewhat surprising comment to make: I'm very much enjoying the sixth season! Would I rather have a full season of Joel? Probably, but the Capras bring their own certain ""sumpin-sumpin"" to Cicely and , much like the final season of ""The X-Files,"" I'm liking this final season much more than I remember enjoying it when it was on TV and I'm certainly enjoying it much more than I expected to. Give it a chance to win you over, too."
3,I wouldn't start here....,"I am a huge Norther Exposure fan, so I had to buy the 6th season to complete my collection. However, I wouldn't start here. The 6th season is a let down compared to the rest of the Seasons. If you have just browsed here, it may be common sense, but stat with #1 and work you way up."
5,Best Episode is in this Season,"Arguably the quirky likablility of Northern Exposure reached its pinnacle in the Horns episode, one of the last. The reversal of gender roles between Maurice and Barbara was priceless, although you did have to know who they were before and my son didn't notice any difference in Barbara. I loved seeing Maurice's machismo humbled by his own water and the words out of Shelley's mouth must be preserved for posterity. ""When women do it it's a disease!"" I don't know if DVD players will be around for my granddaughter's children but if they are, this one is going in my Will."
3,"Northern Exposure, sixth season","The sixth season of Northern Exposure identifies why the series closed. The plots are too far out, the Maggie-Joel factor gone, the rest of the factions worn out. The tension is gone. Technically, the series is good."
3,An odd ending to a great series,"Northern Exposure always had a somewhat metaphysical subtext, and the final season was no exception. Unfortunately, the final season was marred by uneven writing and less than stellar episodes. I also own all previous five seasons; in those, virtually every episode was a gem. Not so in season six. All that being said, two of the season six shows make purchasing this set a ""must"" for series fans. Joel's quest for the ""Jeweled City of the North"" and final episode, ""Tranquility Base"", with its wonderful closing scene with ""Our Town"" sung in the background, bring the series to a satisfying end."
5,Northern Exposure Groupie,"If you're a Northern Exposure fan, you'll love the last season as much as the first. It's a timeless show with wonderful characters. I only wish the current TV shows had the same caliber of depth and intelligence."
4,Inaccurate...AGAIN,"Love this show, but again they were inaccurate. We don't have raccoons here in Alaska and at Thanksgiving time we have over 3 feet of snow in most places. Cicely looked like it barely had any snow at all in November. Other than that, it was some really great writing, especially when Shelly meets the devil. Great screenplays."
1,A great series ruined in last season,"I never watched Northern Exposure when it aired, and today just finished seeing the final episode on dvd, having spent the past year or so watching the whole series from the beginning. This show was terrific until the last season, where it looks like crappy writers took over? Once Joel became awol and his personality changed, the show went downhill fast. The final Joel episode was quite good though, with a magical kind of ending, and perhaps the series should have ended there. Not only were Joel's replacement characters boring, but the stories themselves were also not nearly as good as in the previous 5 seasons.I give it 1 star not because season 6 was as bad 1 star shows, but I'm comparing it to the other seasons, which I would rate 4 or 5 stars."
5,Completed set,I purchased this Sixth Season as a gift for my daughter so she could complete her set. She is extremely happy with it and I was happy to have an easy shopping task to find it for her.
5,What's not to love about Northern Exposure?!,I loved this show when it was on TV! I can't believe they took it off!!
5,TV Season,I have not made it through the season yet but am anxiousely awaiting getting to each disc. It has been super fun watching this series.
5,"Great episodes, as usual","The price reduction was great. I purchased this season and completed purchasing the series. This was such a good show, quirky, funny and entertaining. The addition of two new major characters added to the broad range of possible scenarios for the series. Dr. Fleischman's departure from the show was was done creatively and uniquely."
5,fun!,I will never forget this series! My late father just loved it! He'd sit back & laugh at the characters and when he wasn't feeling good it took his mind off it and made him smile!
2,NE #6,"I went for the later episodes thinking I may not have caught the early ones. I loved what I did see. Two problems: I could not see how to watch the '2nd disc' which is part of 1st disc. The 1st disc I had never seen and was not happy with. Although good, It was not anything like what I remembered watching, ergo, dissappointed."
1,Waste of a dollar,"Waste of money, no index and no way of navigation except turning the page one at a time. Imagine that through a whole bible. I ended up deleting this book from my kindle and purchasing the version with the index, which was worth a few extra dollars. I can now read my new bible! This should not be available for Kindle."
1,Not very literal,"I was hoping for a literal translation. Hebrew names have meaning. Young did not translate them. Young did decent at first, but the bible is very long and it gets less and less literal until it becomes basically identical to the King James translation which is far from literal. There are many phrases in the bible where the meaning can only be classified as ""uncertain"". In my opinion, the JPS translation is the most accurate translation available. Unfortunately, like any translation I have ever seen (Young's Literal Translation included), it does bias itself toward a particular train of thought. A literal translation of the bible still needs to be made as one is not available."
5,Youngs Literal Translation Bible,"This bible is very plainly covered, a basic white hardcover with colored lettering. My husband received this for a Christmas gift and it was the only thing that lit his face up... He thinks it's wonderful. We hope you do too!"
5,Translation Differences,"Wouldn't we all, who enjoy studying God's word, love to get our hands on one single, 100% accurate, translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek autographs. I just purchased Young's Literal Translation, and started my study in Matthew. Things immediately jumped off the page, for exp...Matthew 6:9. KJV says, ""Our Father which art in heaven..."". Young's says, ""Our Father who art in the heavens!"" Notice the exclamation mark. In KJV where the words ""kingdon of heaven"" appear, Young's translation is ""reign of the heavens""- exp: Matthew 5:19. I am enjoying the power in the translation of God of the heavens!"
5,Young's Literal Translation of the Bible,"This is really one of the best study helps I use along with my Young's Concordance, my KJV Bible and other Bible references. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to study the scripture.Jerry F., Ohio"
3,Good reading,I like the Young's Literal translation. The only thing I didn't like about this version was the inability to go to the table of contents and pick a book. It has location numbers and makes it very hard to go to a specific book unless you memorized the location.
3,Very accurate text; good reference book,"If you have ever looked for an illustrated AT&T manual on Unix internals you have just found one. Authors should be praised for the quality and accuracy of the information presented in the book. Very nice chapter on STREAMS. However, it can not be compared with one very fine text such as Bach's book on Unix internals.This one lacks the lucidity and sophistication to qualify as an outstanding reference on the subject . Poor paper and print quality a big minus. Overall, I do recommend this text as your second book on Unix."
2,Does more confusion than explaining,"This seems to be the worst book about the Unix internals I ever read. The signal/noise ratio of this book is quite low. Most of its contents are just slightly commented sVr4 header files (which files by the way you can get for free with a free UnixWare system and not bother about a book). The descriptions of algorighms are short, difficult to follow and sometimes self-contradicting. And between the high-level descriptions of algorithms and low-level header files there is a great gap that makes both these descriptions rather useless. If you look for the description of what's going on inside svr4 then compared to this book the Vahalia's book covers much wider range of systems (including sVr4 and its derivative Solaris), each of them in more detail, has much clearer descriptions, and all that in less volume. But if all you want are slightly commented header files then this book is exactly what you are looking for."
5,A Must Have,"This Pocket Guide is wonderful, and I'm recommending it to all my graduate students as a ""must have"" for their library."
2,too many mistakes,This pocket guide has several APA Style mistakes. The example paper is the most misleading. The text says one thing and the example shows another. e.g. putting the short title on the figure page. My students were very frustrated with it.
5,"great companion to ""Stick Control""",this book will keep you busy for a while and get you used to moving around the set.
5,awesome,Was reluctant in getting this book but gave it a try for the price. All I can say now is that it really burns and at the end of every exercise you feel like you've had a workout. After a while of practicing you will also notice that your agility in moving around the set will improve. Great book for people who want to be more confident on the drumset.
5,Fun Exercises on the Drum Set,"As a beginning drummer, this is a good book to add to your library. I open this book whenever I get tired of practicing rudiments on my practice pad. It really does help you move around the drum kit, plus it makes practicing a lot more fun. I highly recommend this book along with Stick Control by George Lawrence Stone."
2,Drumming,"Worth about the 7 bucks I paid for it?? Tons of exercises, way too many in my opinion. Frankly just boring nut numbing exercises. Better off with the tried and true 1)syncopation for the modern drummer and/or 2)the new breed. Way more interesting than this thing and better overall application to the kit."
4,Let the pain begin!,"I purchased this tape years ago. I was quite surprised by the intensity of the workout. After a while I moved on to other tapes and came back to this one recently. I am still amazed that I, an advanced exerciser can still feel sore using this tape.A word of caution to any beginners or even seasoned exercisers who are not use to The Firm style, start off slow. This tape is not enjoyable at all, it is about pain, pain, and more pain. If you can survive the last segment of the hover squats god bless you. I believe this tape will get just about most legs into great shape. I rotate this tape on a weekly basis with another leg tape and rollerskating to break up the routine. Very nice results.Also, if you want good music, this workout is not for you. This is the classic Firm tapes from mid-1980's until 1992. The music is cheesy, but video quality and scenery great. Exceptional workout!"
5,Lose that baby weight!,"I used this tape to get back in shape after having a baby and it was very effective. I am also a triathlete, and this is a great workout to do on a rainy day as well as to supplement my training. If you don't want to buy The Firm's pricey ""tall box,"" you can find a good substitute at K-Mart or Wal Mart-- it's a ""step/tool box"" that is the perfect height (about 18""). A regular aerobic step is too short and not as effective."
4,Tough lower body workout...,"Need a lower body challenge? This workout is for you. It is a compilation ""parts"" video taken from the Firm Classics Volume 1-6. It is all standing lower body work and will put you to the test. You will need a tall box or stool and assorted dumbells.All the tried and true lower body exercises are on this video, and plenty of them. There are multiple sets of lunges, dips, squats, 6 sets of leg presses, rear leg extensions, leg abductions, and when you think you have had enough, there are a few sets of brutal hover squats at the end. There is also some calf work, and a good amount of the exercises are compound movements, where you are working upper and lower body at the same time. Such as lunges with deltoid raises and bicep curls, squats with overhead presses, etc.The leg workout itself is 35 minutes, plus an 11 minute warm up and cool down. Be sure to have your water handy, you are going to need it for this one."
1,Worst of the Firm I've Tried,"I have about 10 Firm videos and I LOVE them all except this one. I'm so glad I received this as a gift and didn't buy it with my own money. The Firm truly offers the best workouts on the market. However, because this is simply an amalgamation of a bunch of Firm videos I found it disjointed and hard to follow. Basically, they just offer clips of several Firm workouts. Mind you, these are great leg workouts; however, because they are just clips the workouts were never really designed to be done in this kind of sequence. It's better just to buy a regular Firm workout video -- you'll get a great leg workout and the rest of your body will look and feel great too."
1,"If this doesn't kill you, you're one strong person!","If you want to torture yourself, if you want PAIN, if you'd rather spend your time personally acquainting yourself with every single muscle in your lower body, then by all means... get the tape.I'd rather do 15 reps of 2 sets on a leg press machine. I like my kneecaps working."
2,not so educational,it is not mucch of an expalnation.not so educationaldoes a lot of work.Can see a lot of moves
4,Nice for the Price,"I got these sheets when they were on special for $39.99. I really liked the color and the sheen. Unfortunately the sheen is kind of gone and as many other reviewers the sheets get very wrinkled. However, they fit nicely and feel good. And for the thread count for the price its a good deal.I did buy a pair of Red Divatex sheets from the store for $50 and they are still nice and sateen. They also get wrinkled but still look good."
5,divatex sheets,"this sheet set feels very good & stays in place well, after washing it still holds up as if new."
2,Just Okay,I bought these sheets with the hope of having found good sheets at a decent price. Well what can I say the price was decent but the sheets were a disappointment. My major complaint is that the first time I washed them they became discolored in certain areas. I guess if they are available in white you got yourself a deal
5,Great sheets!,"I bought these sheets on sale and for the price they are great sheets, smooth and sleek. They do tend to wrinkle if left in the dryer so you need to take them out and either use them immediately or fold them."
3,More work than it's worth,"The ""printed"" stripe shrinks in the dryer, puckering up the material in the sheets and cases, giving them a searsucker effect. The wrinkles are almost impossible to iron out..wish I had known this before ordering 5 sets!!"
3,"Good fit, not especially soft sheets","After two washings with added fabric softener and dried indoors inside the dryer, the sheets still feel a bit rough against my skin - which I do NOT expect from a 420 tc sheet set. I'm hoping they'll soften up a good bit more with additional washings, but for now, I am not overly impressed. They do fit very well, with deep enough pockets to handle a tall matress, and are otherwise satisfactory."
5,Nice! but...,"These sheets feel great! Very nice to sleep on...But...They are VERY wrinkled comming out of the dryer, so if you want them to look good you have to iron them. If you don't care about the wrinkles, these are very nice sheets."
4,"Easy to Read, Helpful Information","In addition to purchasing several more philosophical texts on child-rearing, I bought this book hoping to get some basic ideas to promote simplicity in our family's life. This is a quick-read full of excellent ideas to pare down the influence of consumerism for our families. I plan to utilize a lot of the ideas in the book and to contact several of the resources listed. I give this 4 stars because it is VERY basic, but excellently written."
3,You might want to read Your Money or Your Life instead...,"after all, it seems to be quoted multiple times in almost every chapter in this book. No wonder the co-author of YMOYL wrote the introduction! Honestly, this is a solid introduction to simplicity; unfortunately, it is hindered by too many references and quotes from Your Money or Your Life. There must be a better way to get across a point other than simply referencing another book (over and over and over). Amazon states that this book cites 72 other books within its pages -- I believe it."
4,"Inspiring, fast read","This was a delightful, fast, engaging, inspiring read. If you are looking to simplify your life and get rid of the consumerism, spending and excess and you want to bring in your family to this way of thinking, check out this book. Reading the stories of other parents and how they were adapting to simplier lifestyle was interesting and validating, since many of the tactics cited as ""downshifting"" we are already doing with our 2-year-old son, like not allowing TV, teaching him to be kind to the earth by using less, and using this lifestyle as a teaching tool.One note on why I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars, I did find it a bit annoying how often this book cited ""Your Money or Your Life,"" (which I had not read but promptly got from the library afterwards.) It was like a sales pitch for the other book. I recommend reading the latter first, then this book."
1,Dogmatic and immpractical,"I had high hopes for this book, but I was sorely disappointed. The author spoke of her belief system so much that I finally put the book down. As a working mother who finds great fulfillment in working fulltime, I really wanted incite into a simple way of life, not a guilt trip because I do not stay home. She kept talking about why you should live simply (part 1), but I felt like her ""how's"" (part 2) for implementing a simple life was not at all useful or practical."
5,Awesome Toning Video,"This is an absolutely wonderful tape. He starts with a short- five minute EASY warm-up. And then moves right on into the toning. The one I ordered came with the toning cord, and he went through very thorough instructions on how to use it before he even started the work-out. The exercises are GREAT. And he does each one of them first, before starting the reps so that you can see how to do it. I noticed results very quickly, and the next day you can really feel that workout! All in all this is a great great video to have. The toning cord kind of stretched out some, so I switched to ten pound weights and was able to do the same exercises. If you're looking for a toning video that is easy but really gives you the work-out this is the one to get."
4,Classic Carr!,"This is a classic John Dickson Carr novel. It is highly original and very unpredictable to the end. A body is found at the bottom of some steps at Traitor's Gate at the Tower of London. This seemingly unexplainable crime is tied to mysterious thefts of people's hats and the disappearance of a valuable manuscript. Gideon Fell is on the case, and he is not disturbed by all the extraneous information that comes out in the investigation. The action takes place over one evening and night which tightens up the mystery considerably. Carr's classic mysteries are always enjoyable reading."
2,Dull,"After hearing ""To Be Young"" in the movie Old School, I went out to purchase this album. The problem is none of the other songs have the same tempo or arrangement. There are obvious Dylan influences in the songs, but the songs don't have the muscial quality that Dylan has. Most songs start with voice and sparse guitar only at a slow tempo. At around the two-minute mark the songs seem to actually take some shape. 1 or 2 slow songs like this would be OK, but when there is a stretch of 10 songs in a row all with the same formula, it gets boring and repetitive. I would recommend Dylan's newer albums or even Tom Waits' albums"
3,Good Effort,"Adams' youthful, whirlwind exhuberance and emulation of Dylan is apparent here. Beginning with the David Rawlings argument concerning a Morrissey track, Adams counts the band into the rollicking freefall of To Be Young (Is To Be Sad,) co-written with Rawlings. That's the best Adams has to offer. The remainder of these mellow tracks, while well-intentioned and thoughtful, are myred in Morrissey-esque melodrama--a quagmire Adams had best avoid if he intends to bask in the shadow of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues."""
4,Profound talent...but not terribly original,"Ryan Adams' first solo album contains some songs that just stun you with their power. ``My Winding Wheel'' is memorable in all its throaty glory, reminiscent of The Faces. ``Call Me On Your Way Back Home'' recalls early Bob Dylan in the way Adams' phrasing and timing brings out emotion. It's wonderful stuff, and anyone who is a fan of good songwriting should enjoy this. But Adams has yet to outgrow his musical influences and grow comfortable in his own skin. This record is different from Gold in numerous ways, but both have a melancholy feeling to them, and both show Adams has yet to develop an identity."
5,One of his best,"If I had to pick 2 Ryan Adams albums along the best 100 albums ever made I would pick Heartbreaker and Gold, with easy Tiger as close third. It belongs right next to the production of Neil Young and Lucinda Williams. Great songs, arrangements, musicians, performance, feel, recording and production. Come lift me up is one of my all time favourites when it comes to alt country drum sound when I work in my studio. What more can I say??? I wish more recordings had the sound, presence and dynamics just like this one. Heartbreaker is probably Ryan Adams' finest album. Very well done!"
3,Almost,"This guy has so much potential, but is not there just yet. This album reminds me of Simon and Grafunkels ""Sounds of Silence"" album in that regard. Still there are some excellent songs on here. If you want to here something different and don't mind sitting through some sub par tracks this album is a good choice."
1,c -grade stuff,Scuffed boots snot-nose Ryan Adams continues his streak of below average music. Whiskeytown was rehashed Uncle Tupelo and Ryan's solo work is college bar band level alt. country. 100's who have come before have done it better and with a bunch more heart. p-u.
1,Osvaldo Golijov he is not,"I was recommended this because of my purchase of a disk by Osvaldo Golijov. Well, Osvaldo Golijov he is not.The music on this disk has no value for me, it just seems like someone making random noises. What does it mean? Only something for the Ryan Adams fans, I am afraid."
5,The Return Of The Grevious Angel,"There are some albums I revere so much I save them for special occasions - usually listening to them alone for fear of being too overbearing around my friends - re the reasons why such music is not destined for the mainstream charts. ""Some music is SO good and so personal it is not meant for mass consumption"", I am usually laughed out the door like some aging old hippie that took too many drugs back in the '60s. These are the albums where you buy a complete set - the vinyl, a tape for the car, and two CDs - one, just in case....""I dunno, just in case, alright ! "" John Lennon's `Plastic Ono Band` is one, so is Dave Crosby's `If Only I Could Remember My Name`; the rest are everything Gram Parsons ever did, especially `The Fallen Angels Live 1973` with Emmy Lou Harris. I have just added Ryan Adams `Heartbreaker` to that list. From this point on my lips are sealed. Love and Peace."
3,A bit too stripped down for my taste,"If you love Whiskeytown, you'll like Ryan Adams first solo effort. It's everything you'd expect from Ryan Adams - inisightful lyrics (a bit more introspective than usual), nice guitarwork, and fine vocals (plus the added bonus of guest appearances by Emmylous Harris, Gillian Welch and Kim Richey). But it is just a bit too stripped down for my taste; I prefer the full sound of Whiskeytown to Ryan Adams alone on his guitar. I still suggest picking it up though."
3,"Honestly, I Prefer Adams' Later Stuff","I guess i'm one of those Ryan Adams' fans that true Ryan Adams' / Whiskeytown fans spit upon, because I was largely unimpressed by this record. I think the alt-country thing is great and all, but after starting strong, this album gets a little tired towards the end and the songs all sorta run together. ""AMY"" and ""To Be Young..."" are the highlights in my opinion and are reason enough to buy Heartbreaker used, but if you're like me and loved Rock & Roll / Love Is Hell, then prepare to be disappointed. No smack against Adams, but this one just didn't turn my crank."
3,Wildly Overrated Album,"Reduce HEARTBREAKER into its basic components and what you have is one outstanding song (Come Pick Me Up) and five good songs (To Be Young -- Amy -- Oh My Sweet Carolina -- Damn, Sam -- Shakedown on 9th Street). The remaining half of the album is pleasant but forgettable filler, plain and simple.Come on, folks. This is a 2.5 star or 3 star album, at best. Even the most ardent Ryan Adams fan, in good conscience, cannot possibly award this inexplicably overrated album more than 4 stars. Those interested in exploring his discography would be better served by the slick but musically diverse GOLD or the beautiful, stripped-down JACKSONVILLE CITY NIGHTS.5 star reviews shouldn't be tossed around like candy. They should be reserved for superlative, historically-emblematic, best-of-the-best albums such as Joni Mitchell's BLUE, Dusty Springfield's DUSTY IN MEMPHIS or Gram Parsons' G.P./GRIEVOUS ANGEL, to name a few. HEARTBREAKER is nowhere near 5 star league."
2,Too downbeat,I seem to be in the minority but I find this album unlistenable.I've listened to it about 10 times but I just cant get into it.I much prefer the last Whiskeytown album Pnuemonia.
4,The World's Greatest Authority on Popular Music sez...,"I like this! Nothing original, but then there's been nothing truly original in popular music since the '60s. Adams is, however, a synthesist of the first magnitude. Doesn't quite come up to the new creative standard set by the Jayhawks on ""Smile"" but Adams is definitely giving hints he's capable of the reach."
3,"Good, but he keeps getting better","As Ryan's first solo album this is a great breakaway from Whiskytown. His lyrics are inventive but his sound is still a little exploratory and he doesn't seemed to have quite found himself yet. It's definately worth a buy but his subsequent albums, especiallly Gold and Demolitions keep getting better."
4,Ryan's Swan Song thus far,"Ryan Adams is not God. He's not even a genius. He's prolific. He writes millions of songs, and does not leave anything left over for waste. This is reason why his albums are so long, this one included. That being said, this is the best of his long winded solo work. I could complain, but the music is too good to."
4,It's amazing he USED to sound like this.,"This album, along with Pneumonia, are Ryan Adams' two best accomplishments. Heartbreaker is one of the reasons alternative country is so popular today. The album does run a little long, and his best work is on the first half of the album. However, this barely takes away from its quality. My favorite songs on the album (if you're interested) are ""Winding Wheel"" and ""Come Pick Me Up.""It's unfortunate that Ryan Adams' new albums are such rubbish. I guess some artists who ""have it"" can just ""lose it."""
5,"Heavy, trudging COC - good stuff!","This is a transition album for COC. It's nothing like their previous work and merely a sign for things to come. Dark chugging riffs with their old vocalist Karl Agell. If you can get past Karl's voice, then you've got an awesome metal album. Awesome opening instrumental stuff."
1,Truly awful,"It's like listening to rock and roll. What happened to the hardcore? What happened to the thrash?This album is awful. It's a totally different band, basically, from Corrosion of Conformity's Animosity album."
1,THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.,Features the second worst vocalist in this band's history (Simon Bob being the worst.) This album also sparked a total change in musical direction which went from hardcore/punk to thrash metal to this 'stoner rock' incarnation. At least this mediocrity didn't continue into their later albums. I truly think that this band revamped their sound as result of never being at ease with their vocalists. Please skip this album as it really is a hangover from their Technocracy era. Get Wiseblood if you like the 'sabbath' sound or the untouchable thrash fest of ANIMOSITY (which feature bassist Mike Dean on vocals.)
2,COC made a lot of bad decisions regarding their vocalists.,"Blind, paired with the previous EP (Technocracy), are easily COC's worst records. Both primarily because of embarassingly lousy vocalists. I don't know which is worse, Simon Bob Sinister's flacid & ineffectual whining on Tech, or Karl Agel's ""No, really! I'm a rockstar!"" godawful crooning on Blind. Now that I'm thinking about it, I'd really have to say that Blind is worse. It's a much longer recording. Still, Blind is almost worthwhile because of the one non-Karl song on it, Vote With A Bullet, which is sung by Pepper... the man who dragged COC out of the gutter and gave them a second chance.This album does have occasional moments of greatness in the instrumentation and songwriting, but for old time fans like me, it just screamed ""HI, WE'RE CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, WE'RE TIRED OF BUSTING OUR HUMPS SLOGGING THE UNDERGROUND HARDCORE GRIND, AND WE'RE READY TO SELL OUT NOW, PLEASE!"""
4,SUPERB 90's METAL!!!!!,"1991''DANCE OF THE DEAD'' one of the best METAL song's of the 90's..and they made a GREAT video for it as well! check that drum work!!BLIND is one hell of angry/erie album that is on the verge of collapse, I dont agree with all they say..but some I do!! so many different style's to this album.. a lot like BLOODY KISSE's by TYPE O..perhap's the SOUHTERN version?? but hell this was made before that album!!Stuff that will make you think and song's you will sing yer self!!ONE OF THE BEST OF THE 90's!!!''VOTE WITH A BULLET'' more relevent today then ever before!!"
3,Daubentonia madagascariensis,"Blind is decent but I prefer ""EYE FOR AN EYE.""Has Reed Mullin's new band, BROWN, released anything yet?It would be cool if they would go ahead and release ""We've got an Eye for the Aye-Aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis)."" I'm sure that BROWN would be the natural ones to do this work rather than C.O.C.Reed was always the one pressing for social change. BROWN should be really good.The best part of this album, BLIND, is the presence of Phil Swisher. His new band, LEADFOOT, is the best."
4,near-perfect pure metal,"After years of toiling away in the underground hardcore/thrash scene, COC moved up to a higher level here with the addition of guitarist Pepper Keenan and vocalist Karl Agell. As with the previous hardcore material, the lyrics are still intelligently political. But the music goes beyond simple thrash to a more technical metal similar to old Metallica or Megadeth. Excellent chops and solid songwriting on this album put COC in the same class as those two bands and the heavy power groove also establishes them with 90s contemporaries like Pantera."
3,Not as good as before but not bad....,This was one of the only albums from COC that I didn't own or had heard because fans of their work had always told me this album lacked the magic and the feel of the earlier ones. They were not wrong. It seemed mixed poorly and the songs and melodies didn't reverberate with me as much as before. All in all it is not a bad album. Just not as good as before. A solid 6 out of 10.
5,IL ROMANZO DI UNA PERVERSIONE,"Ho avuto la fortuna e l'onore di leggere ben due romanzi (Frisk, Ziggy) e un racconto (Sbagliato)di quest'uomo che non esito a definire un genio dei desideri oscuri. Lo ringrazio per avermi dato delle emozioni così viscerali. Lo ammiro così tanto che ho chiamato come Lui il personaggio principale di una raccolta di racconti da me, umilmente, scritta. Non ho parole. Raccomando vivamente a chi vuole godere in modo maligno l'insuperabile e devastante FRISK."
2,Cooper vs. Brite,"I found this to be confusing, due to the narration. It jumps from 1st person to 3rd to 1st again. By jumping like that, it pushed me away from the story rather than be pulled in. This book is reminiscent of Poppy Z. Brite's Exquisite Corpse which is much more brutul and tantalizing than this book."
1,disintegrates in the sunlight,I've had this cover for a year and it simply has started to disintegrate in the sunlight. I live in Southern California by the ocean. Not pleased with this product.
5,Just right!,I measured carefully before purchasing as I have a large wicker Lazy-Boy recliner. The cover fits with room to remove it easily. It is light weight but seems durable. (I have only had it for about a month). My chair sits in full afternoon sun and the cover is protecting it well.
3,Protective Covers,Material feels strong and is well sown.Other canvas products tend to rot after 3 or 4 months.I am using it as the cover for a 3 seater aluminum T-Top helsman's seat.Let's wait for at least a couple of more months.
3,Fine for what they are.,"Did not want to review this product right away because I had no idea of how they would hold up. They are nice covers for the money. I would purchase them again, but consider them to be average chair covers. After the first year they began to show wear and by the second year they began to crack a little. However, with extreme weather you are going to find this to be true with most outdoor furniture covers. We are still using them and they have held up fine regardless of the wear (still usable and look ok) and hope to use them another year or so. They do their job in keeping our wooden chairs clean and dry."
5,Great chair covers,Purchased two of these covers for our new outdoor lazy boy recliners. They fit and have kept our chairs clean and dry. Would recommend these to others.
3,Glass microwave dish,"The dish is good but I ordered the wrong brand and so it doesnt fit my microwave right, but I am living with it,,,every thing else was good"
2,First Timers Beware,"Being a first timer at MCSE testing I figured the book with the least amount of fluff would get me through, that and the aid of a real Proxy Server running in front of me how could I go wrong? Now I know, buying this book provided very little relevant information to what the test would encompass and missed many key areas even when going back to research my weaknessess, leaving me feeling like an idiot for not knowing what was never there to learn in the first place. I would suggest reading the comics instead."
2,Don't be fooled!,"Don't be fooled by the new cover boasting ""Updated Exam Content"". It's still below par for Exam Cram. You'll want several other books if you do use this one."
1,This book is terrible,"This is by far the worst exam cram book I have read (I used them for the core 4, and they were great for them). It was obviously thrown together and represents only a small portion of the exam. Case in point, on the back of the book under the ""in this book you'll learn to"" it lists items that are not in the exam objectives and are not even covered in the book itself!! Don't waste your money, use the Sybex Exam Notes, it was excellent."
2,Use only as a quick review if necessary,"Unlike the core Exam Cram books, this volume contains significant omissions and errors. As an example, the chapter on installation has some screen captures which are outdated, and it provides an incorrect narrative of the actual installation steps. I would recommend the Sybex MCSE:Proxy Server 2 Study Guide and the Transcender exam instead of this work."
3,Sufficient at best. Many items not covered,"I have used all the Core Exam crams, (which were outstanding) but Proxy 2 is lacking in several areas. Including : IPX implementation across operating system types, details on Win 3.11 / UNIX / Novell Clients, and Web Caching details. It has enough information to pass the test, but I found myself needing to make educated guesses on uncovered situations too often. It seems like another printing of this title is needed to cover these topics."
2,Don't buy this book,"I failed this test because I relied on this book! It only gave you the general information about MS Proxy 2.0. If you want to ace the test, at least buy the Exam Prep or other resource.I bought another publication from Coriolis which was the Exam Prep, and still failed the test. It was becaused the majority of the questions are not covered in the book."
1,Not complete,"This book does not contain all the information you need to study for or pass the exam. Worse yet, when you return to your car after failing the exam and try to see if any of the test items that seemed foreign to you are actually in the book, you'll find that the entire index was built only on the practice questions in the book and not on any real content."
2,Not enough for the test!,"Up to this point in my quest for MCSE, Exam Cram books have been excellent study resources for the tests. This book falls short (way short) of preparing you for success on the test.P.S. I understand these books are for final review and fine tuning for the test. However, why do they state on the cover ""First and Last Book You Need"" for test preperation. Very misleading."
2,Poor,"I am an MCSE+Internet, CIW, A+, Network+, and I-net+ professional.I blew the proxy server exam away with a score in the 900s. This book gave me no help, though. (By the way, I had never used IIS before I started studying for the test, let alone take the test.)It is very poorly organized, horribly written, hard to follow, does not cover the objectives in any way, and the review questions are horrible."
4,"Save Some Time for Yourself, Too.","When I scheduled the tests for MCSE. I didn't give enough time for this test, and I had no other choice but using exam cram books which I highly trust. They tend to cover most with a few mistakes. I finished this book within 2 days and passed the test. I read other reviews that this book is to read after TCP/IP and IIS4, but that's not really true. I only had basic knowledge of TCP/IP and IIS, and MS Proxy test doesn't require you to know corelated subject in depth. The book covered enough basics for me to pass the test. Save some time for yourself, too.MCSE, A+, Network+, i-Net+"
3,"If you haven't passed IIS 4.0, dont even try","I can understand why people are split on this book. If you have done IIS 4.0 (internet service provider) you will have no trouble with this. Ifyou have not, it will be a difficult exam. I also suggest you buy the ""Exam Prep"" for proxy. If you don't understand IIS, TCP/IP, IEAK 4.0, Site Server you will not understand this book. If you do, it is good exam material. Jeffe"
2,"good general review, vague.",Ok book. But definetly not good enough to pass exam better off buying Sybex Proxy Exam Notes.
3,Good book,I think its funny that I can read this book and do a few transcender tests and not have actually ever seen or used Proxy server2.0 and pass the MCSE exam for this with a score of over 920.
3,Get this and Transcenders And you'll pass!,I've used this book and the Transcender Exam and passed Proxy Server 2 on my first try. It's not that bad of a book.
2,Not very informative at all,"I've used various books for various tests, and this was the worst of them all. I read the whole thing and felt like I knew very little about Proxy Server. Having taken the test, I will say that very little of what was on there was explained in the Exam Cram book. Good thing it wasn't the only book I read!"
1,The Hallelujah Chorus is the worst anywhere.,"Christmas albums are a way for almost any singer to make some extra money. No matter how badly they are done, or how far Christmas songs are from their usual stuff, they sell. This is one of those.I am OK with Neil Diamond, but he just can't get it together for the Christmas album. Some of them are so bad it sounds like he is singing the words phonetically, not knowing or caring what they mean. I'm almost embarrassed for him."
5,fireside Christmas music,"With a velvet voice what more could you wish to listen to,sat next to a blazing log fire,with snow gently falling outside"
3,More enjoyable than Volume I.,"Diamond's second Christmas collection is an improvement on his first. By sticking with tunes that don't have signature renditions, Diamond has an easier time making the songs his own. Having fun with a variety of traditionals like, ""Deck The Halls"" and ""The First Noel,"" and by putting a new spin on ""Rudolph"" and ""Sleigh Ride;"" Diamond does a decent job. Not exactly a vital part of my Christmas collection, but not a bad contribution."
5,~Love it!,~I would certainly recomend Neil Diamond Christmas for any who enjoy Neil Diamond and Christmas music! I love the arrangements!
2,Perfectly Titled,"As with other Becher students, Hofer's images are captivating because of their expansiveness and detail - neither of which are reflected in the layout of this book. The images are tiny for no apparent reason. This effectively reduces Hofer's amazing work to a series of oversized postage stamps.Unless the design is intended as a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the title, this dilettante overview is a miserable failure.I suggest purchasing Candida Hofer, A Monograph. It is large, bold and a substantial compendium of her work."
2,Twin thriller falls to satisfy...,"""Redeye"" by Richard Aellen had a good idea on paper. Good American journalist tries to stop evil twin, who happens to be a communist, from carrying out his evil plan, in this case, an assasination. However, it didn't quite work out that way. The journalist was the only really fully developed chatcter. His ignored wife Joanna is simply one note, and Karl, his evil twin, has no redeemable qualities. Add a slightly bonkers CIA psychologist to the mix, and you have quite a muddled, and actually quite boring story. Yes, there are a few thrills, seeing Mark escape the East Germans is one. Another is the scene at the hospital near the end where Mark is in a battle agaisnt time to save Joanna. Reading this now makes you realize how dated this book was."
5,You need to buy this!,This book has been an excellent addition to my library on birding. Splendid photography! Helpful tips!Interesting insights and all at a great price. The book is beautiful and is clearly of high quality. You won't be disappointed!
5,Very Happy,"Very happy with my purchase, book is great and delivery fast. Great book for anyonethat just likes to try to figure out what birds are in your area and some good informationon them too."
5,excellent,Lorenz's theories simply and logically explained. Very thought provoking material. Don't be afraid that it's out of date.
3,A Good Starter,"A good starter for stock investing. It is one of my very first book in stock investing. After you have a couple years of experience, the books may not provide sufficient information for you to make investment decision."
1,Not serious at all,"The book is in a very bad condition, outside and inside, as if it was found in the street or in the garbage. Beside, it dates back to 2002, meaning it is too old in terms of publication. I haven't even touch it, because it may be polluted or contaminated.This is disgusting"
4,Good cd,the bass player for the band taught me how to play bass. he is the man. he gave me this cd almost 5 years ago on a cd-r. its good stuff
3,Review - The Bath and Body Book,"If you are searching for a 'How To' book that gives you explicit details on how to make lotions and soaps from scratch, this is not the book for you. The lotions and soaps listed in this book are made from lotion and soap bases. Otherwise, it is a great guide for at home beauty techniques."
4,Aren't you tired of rolling over?,"Tom Kratman clearly delineates why you should never mess with Texas... Too often we forget that the politicians that ""lead"" us are only human and the common man ends up paying the price for that folly. Lieutenant Colonel Kratman uses his extensive knowledge of military SOP and tactics to give the reader an accurate and entralling picture of what this besetting sin can lead us all into. The only problem I found was the likelyhood of there being a decent human being with the werewithal to stand up to the situation. Still, it would have been a short story , otherwise, so it can be overlooked. He even went so far as to allow the good ""guy"" the time and incentive to develop the dual miracle of a conscience and a backbone in a politician at the same time. A very good early work for the author showing a lot of promise for the future. Buy it, read it, love it. I am eagerly anticipating the next works by the author."
1,I thought it was a satire....,"I thought this book was an over-the-top satire along the lines of Norman Spinrad's satire THE IRON FIST (an example of how Hitler would have written an 1930s science-fiction novel), complete with cardboard characters, B-movie violence, and foam-at-the-mouth political rantings, until I realized that the author was serious. My advice: write the author and ask for your money back."
1,dont even call this Sci Fi,"This book is so stereo typed and over the top, that the only thing it could be considered is political satire. It is so poorly written that I have removed anything else written by Kratman from my wish list. Especially after previewing his next book at Baen's web site. He is so far right wing in these books, that he is beyond the fringe.I have no problem with the sci fi concept of suspending disbelief, bu he goes too far to be credibly considered a Sci Fi writer.I've been an avid Sci Fi reader since the late 50's, and have a book collection that is beyond 5000 titles that I have kept thru 4 moves. This is the first title I intend to not keep. He is an embarrassment to Heinlein, Leinster, Reynolds and Norton. He even makes the Gor novels, especially the later books seem almost mainstream."
1,Unreadable; can I award negative stars?,"In a lifetime filled with more than a book per day, there have been only a handful whose writing was *so* appalling as to almost physically repel me. This piece of barely-literate junk now heads that pile - the only book for which I've ever demanded a refund!Yeah, the politics are crude well past the point of idiocy, but that's a minor sin compared to the total absence of any trace of writing ability, plot interest, characterisation... I could go on, but the point should be clear. And I am fine with right-wing, military SF - although as others have noted, this is not even SF. It's - well, it's just tripe, basically.Baen's recent offerings in this genre have been good to excellent - Ringo, Williamson are closest but also the more established Weber, Drake and so on. This? Is an aberration. Bleagh.[However, I *do* need to give kudos to the Baen folk for superb handling of the irate note I sent to them. Well done, folks; this book is unworthy of you.]"
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"I bought this book because I read Watch on the Rhine and thought that was an enjoyable read. This book was just absolutely horrible. The politics offended me at every level. In addition, the characters were all cardboard and stereotypic. The sexism and rascism in the author's beliefs were hard to disguise. I will never buy another book by this author again."
2,To the Right of the Tea Party,Unless you are slightly to the right of the Tea Party you will find this book unreadable. It is written like the worst nightmare of all of the right wing conspiracy theorists. If you are a moderate or even slightly to the left Mr. Kratman's book reads like Republican party election year propaganda.
1,Extreme Right-Wing Drivel,"The author exposes his strong right wing views on nearly every page. The newly elected President in 2009 (obviously Hilary Clinton) is a lesbian, who beds her lesbian lover (who is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) in the Oval Office...The Secret Service is like Hitler's SS, with mechanized troops, the Surgeon General has her own armed forces in order to enforce abortion rights, weapons and ammunition are heavily taxed and registered, teachers are ""reeducated"" unless they have the proper liberal views, etc.Nearly every Rush Limbaugh\Ann Coulter ""fantasy"" is trotted out during the course of this book. This is too bad, because the author obviously is familiar with the military (the Army in particular), and the idea of a modern civil war could have been intriguing."
2,Heavy Handed Attempt At Social Commentary,"The story here is so over the top, that the attempt at presenting a social message is totally wasted. Kratman presents a brave Texas standing alone against the evil federal government, after being provoked beyond tolerance by events that even include a recreation of the Alamo, complete with multiple references to the deguello!The story is are dragged along, with the only real question being why it takes the Army and the Marines as long as it does to follow the Air Force's example.The entire effort seems to have been designed just to let the author present a series of ""proposed"" constitutional amendments, parts of which are guaranteed to offend just about everyone. Limiting federal sprawl, and RKBA sentiments are just fine, but Kratman is no Heinlein or Pournelle, or even an L. Neil Smith."
3,Ranting 101,"Tom Kratman is a good writer; he creates interesting characters, he writes very well about military encounters, he keeps the action going and balances many story threads easily. That said, this story of a near-future alternate US history is an undisguised political/philosophical rant. The bad guys are evil, the good guys are saints. The situation is wrung for pathos and to make innumerable points. A lighter touch would have rescued this effort and made it a much more interesting novel."
2,Crap,"If you want a better-written, over-the-top, libertarian condemnation of the Clintons, from Baen, in a near-future scenario, try Last Centurion. Although that author also has bizarre opinions of people who disagree with him, he is better at putting it on paper. Both authors use in their scenarios a thinly-disguised President Hillary Clinton as a villan, but this guy opens the book up with her as a lesbian more-totalitarian Hugo Chavez type. And when it comes to second American Revolution tales from Baen, there was a better one from many years back called (I think) First Citizen."
3,Thought provoking,"A good SF novel has a big idea that drives the storyline. This one does and hence on the whole I liked this book despite some limitations. The book is set in a near future USA and deals with the question of when it is justifiable to rebel against your elected government. The narative action is good and enjoyable. It's weakness is that the baddies are just too bad and somewhat cliched, however this should not distract you from reading the book. The major theme of the book is the Nanny state gone mad and how the best of intentions can be hijacked by those who wish to gain or remain in power. Despite the limitations of the characterizations I can see parallels with real people - particularly here in Europe.Overall I recommend it."
5,Can't work without it.,"I use several bean-bag type wrist cushions and this one is by far my favorite. Long enough to service the width of the keyboard, it provides cushioned comfort wherever it hurts the most. Flexible to accomodate any work environment. Great for road warriors wanting to keep track of only one wrist cushion, but needing flexible comfort for both wrists. I often wrap around a corner of my laptop and have it serve as a wrist pad for using the mouse, too."
1,Burst open after having it for 4 days!,"This wrist cushion burst open after I had it 4 days, and the little pellets were leaking out. The cloth it's made from and the stitching is very shabby. I purchased it from Walmart and will be returning it. Instead I will order the Belkin gel wrist cushion from Amazon. I have owned their gel mouse pad for about 6 years and never had any problems."
2,Very poor software!!,"Although the book was in a good presentation style, unfortunately the testing software that comes with it is very disappointing, not user friendly in the least, invisible answers, answers that can't be seen because of the exhibit buttons.If you don't need the software then the book is OK, but if you are relying on the software for the exam prep questions then forget it!!"
5,Just what I needed!,"I'm 44 years old and have not exercised to speak of in 2 years. I also quit smoking 2 years ago, and have put on about 20 unwanted pounds. The gym was too hard to get to, and walking alone at night was out of the question. A friend at work recommended these tapes, so I bought them. I have been more than pleased. Walking in my home, on MY schedule is wonderful. The music is just right and the group on the tape with Leslie helps keep me going. In the 2 weeks I've been using these tapes (every day), I already feel so much better. They are definitely just what I needed to put me on the road to better health and weight."
5,It's the best!!!,"I have bought so many ""get thin"" things. I have been using these tapes for only a few days and I know they are helping me.I feel better. I enjoy the music. I can actually do the few steps. I use my own weights.I told my Weight Watchers group about them and someone asked me to bring the set in so that they could order a set also.Leslie has my vote."
1,Confused mess.,"This movie is an hour of the most poorly told story with some inept acting to help it along. From the obvious symbolism of the two smoke stacks towering over the two young men meeting to the grainy, pseudo-documentary footage, this movie is irritating from the get go. Don't let the cover fool you, as it did me. That image comes about three times in the movie and means almost nothing. Don't waste your time and money on this one. It's price is the only thing that is of high quality. It is not enlightening, uplifting or entertaining. Why bother?!"
1,The Second Coming,I thought I had already reviewed this product. just got it because it's gay film.I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
1,Disgusting and does not belong in religious materials,"I understand the filth got into religious movies because of the title, could that have been on purpose? Do they really believe a true christian would order such garbage?"
1,Really not that impressed.,"Sorry to say I was not that impressed by this video. The video is supposed to be about Great Lake Shipwreaks, but only discussed two wrecks that somehow involved the same cook on both. About 35 minutes were on one wreck, and the remaining 10 minutes was on the other wreck. Seems to me the title of this should have been more specific and indicated something like the cook of two Great Lakes Shipwrecks. Was the video interesting? Well to some degree. I was expecting an abbreviated history of the shipwrecks from the Griffin to the Fitzgerald, or something like that. I'm glad Amazon provides the option to watch the video online, because I would not spend the money on buying this video for my home collection."
3,A Layman's Introduction to Grid Vulnerabilities,"The video pulls the viewer along by watching what is presumed to be White House team tasked with dealing with the problemwhile the narrator explains the situation. I think it is a good video, as far as it goes, but I have a few nits to pick:1. I think the video soft-pedals just how bad it would be if the US electrical grid were brought down by a natural or manmade EMP event. I think William Forstchen's novel ""One Second After"" does a better job of that.One Second After2. While most of the vulnerabilities are understood, little to nothing seems to be done to address them. The viewer is leftwith the (probably true) feeling that hope is being used as a substitute for a plan. If this is not true, then the video shouldhave made that clear."
2,wonderfull book,enjoyed reading this book.. finished it in 3days.. had to put it down to go to work~!~! now i wanna know when will we find out what happened to the sea born woman's son..Jermey.. when he was taken north....
3,Bait and Switch,"OK, I'm a pig. I bought this because the guy on the cover LOOKS hot. However, all he does is introduce the segments, embarrasingly badly. The exercise portion of the video turns out to be exerpts from other FIRM videos, led by women in cheesy aerobics outfits.The exercises, however, are very serious. You feel them for days, and you'll be lucky to get through the routine the first time.So, a good workout tape, but a deceptive marketing campaign!"
3,Good Content But Not Presented Well,"I was so excited to read this book when it came in the mail but I was disappointed when I started reading it. There are so many typos and grammar errors it was distracting. By the end of the book I was paying more attention to the errors I found on every page and less on the content of the stories.The stories are good and have great potential. They are maddening and eye-opening but I hoped they would have done more with it. To me, it reads more like a second draft not a final published copy. The copy is repetitive and unimaginative but the potential is there for some wonderful stories if they found an excellent editor to make it sing and make it a more interesting read.For what it is, I would recommend it but I would love to see them rewrite the narratives - then they would have an excellent book, not just a 'good' one."
1,Highly Disappointing,"I found this book to be full of errors in grammar, spelling, typesetting and punctuation which made it very difficult and tedious to even finish. The reader will find every story to be almost exactly the same. The writing style is that of a junior high student. The narration at times abruptly jumps from third to first person which adds to the difficulty of following the stories. Add to this a highly repetitive, redundant style of writing... I am sorry I wasted my money on this."
3,From the EXAmish.com guy,"As a former Amish, I own this book, and I have to agree it was poorly edited, but it is a true-life experience book.-Joewww.examish.comwww.amishconfidential.com"
2,A Little Slow,I thought the stories were very similar and repetitive. It was an easy read though. I did learn a few new things.
3,Nice quick read,"Having visited Lancaster County, Pa I've been able to be in contact with the Amish. I have always wondered about them--about their traditions and their religious beliefs. I also wondered how many do defect, and join mainstream America.It was a pleasure when I came across this book through Amazon, and even so when I received it in the mail a couple of days later. Knowing what I know now about the Amish only makes me want to learn more about them.Although the book has many grammatical errors, the message gets across loud and clear. All who left the Amish left for different reasons, but one stands out---FREEDOM. I don't understand why the Amish think that theirs is the only true religion and everybody else on the face of the earth is condemned to eternal damnation.I wish I could find another book like this one where it talks about the ""not so perfect world"" of the Amish. This was a nice, quick read--not too deep, and not too shallow."
3,An interesting glimpse and makes me curious about more,"""True Stories of the X-Amish....an interesting glimpse into a closed fragment of our society based on good intentions but laden with human frailty. It makes me curious about other attitudes, politicisms, and power-mongering inside the Amish church."" J. A. Stokes"
1,Mostly Not True,"Recently I bought this book, knowing the Amish very well, not to mention the head bishop. Some of the stuff in there was so false. I also let several of the amish read it, and the idea about bishops being picked by a mark in the book, I dont think so. And as far as the pictures go, the one taken in Munfordville KY hate to tell you thats not Munfordville, there is no ""OLD order"" amish in Munfordville. Sorry to give it the 1 star wouldnt give it that, but thats the lowest it goes. I can almost tell anything about the amish, and the amish girl im talking to, why she tells me things that is going to happen before they happen and even she said this book had no meaning, so before writing a book about something you have no idea, GET a idea first. Wish I had my money back reader"
1,Horrible Product!,I bought this pump and for a few days couldn't have been happier with my purchase. Little did I know that this pump wouldn't even last a week. I wouldn't recommend this unless you like stuff that breaks down in an unreasonable amount of time.
2,NO such thing as a quiet air pump!!,"I must have very sensitive ears, because the Rena 300 sounded like a truck running. The tank is in my son room which is on the other side of the house; down a long hallway, past a bathroom no where near my room and I could hear that pump Buzzing away. By 2am I con't take the noise anymore & had to unplug it, and when I did my son said ""don't ever plug it back in!""I bought 6 different air pump (ranging from $14 to $50) and I learned they ALL make noise, there no such thing a silent & quiet air pump. I con't take any of the Rena (I tried the rena 100, 200 & 300), and I tired the Tetra 10 & 40 they too where way too noisy. But the Tertra whisper 60 surprisingly, was quiet enough where we could sleep. I think it all depends on what your ears can take; I say buy couple different sizes & brands till you find the one your ears likes."
3,Does not meet expectations,"I bought this pump after reading hyped up reviews by others and inflated product specifications from the manufacturer. It does not deliver anywhere near as much air as promised, no matter where I set the control screw. I've had better luck with pumps that cost me less than half what this one did, so I will stick with those in the future."
2,UN HAPPY FISHEYS,"I was really excited about getting this air pump for my 60 gallon fish tank. I plugged it in, very quiet but when I turned it up to its max air flow setting, it couldn't even blow one air bubble into my tank with an 8ft hose. I dont know if it was malfunctioning or just got damaged during shipping but I had to return it and was left with my old and noisy pump. I now have to wait for my refund and go to the pet store later this week. Not cool RENA AIR PUMP PEOPLE.... NOT COOL. :("
4,A book with options...,Most Tarot students will tell you that the court cards are their nemeses and that specialized lessons in this particular area of Tarot would be really helpful. This book isn't formula and it won't tell you just one way to look at the Tarot courts... Mary and Tom describe a multitude of different methods leaving you to choose what works best for you. They include exercises that will challenge how you feel about the court cards. I particularly enjoyed the comparison of the Rider and Thoth courts... something that's never been explained to my satisfaction before. Perhaps some readers don't have any trouble at all with the courts and don't need this book. The majority of us WILL benefit from examining the courts more closely and trying out different methods. This book is an excellent resource.
4,great accessory...,"Make sure you read the booklet that came with your phone, because you have to adjust your phone for this headset. I have a Kyocera 2255 and I had to go to (on my cell phone) ""settings"" then ""voice services"" then ""voice answer"" to ""enable"" hearing my phone calls. If I didn't read this I would have never heard someone ring me. When I did this a computer voice would come on asking me if I would accept the call. and I would have to say ""yes"" or ""no"" into the headset, and then my call would be put through.What I didn't like was this headset can easly fall out of your ear. I have to use the clip that came with it (which attaches to your shirt). but still it would be nice to have to a piece that attaches to your ear.Also there is no on/off switch. which is irrating. But there is a volume adjuster.overall it is a very good buy. I carry it everywhere I go. I ended up buying another one because I usually forget where I place them."
3,Be with you,"The song "" Be With You"" is off the hook!!! This is something you listen to when you wanna be freaky with your Man."
4,What a debut!!,"I first saw Elisabeth Withers video on BET ""Be With You"" and had to have the CD. It's awesome I like her style and spirit. It comes from the heart. Great job Elisabeth"
4,Really Worth a Listen,"I wasn't prepared for what I was getting when I purchased this CD. I figured the song that gets the radio play was probably the most worthy of listening to (as is with most music these days). The most I'd hoped for was at least one other track that would be pleasing. Fortunately, I was wrong. The entire CD is nice and very well worth owning."
3,TALENTED HER VOICE IS ON POINT,I LOVE HER STYLE THE ALBUM IS DIFFERENT THERE ARE SOME SONGS ON THERE I WOULD SKIP BUT ALL IN ALL THE ALBUM IS OK.
1,Not A Good Buy,"Within four months of purchase one of the cassette decks stopped working. No matter how much I try to adjust the sound, it is never clear. This was a great disappointment."
2,Lower quality oil,"After reading most of the review on this product I decided to order it even though many had said that it smelled too sweet. My experience has been that it wasn't as much too sweet as it was too sticky. Also, it didn't really smell like Kukui Nut, it smells more like cotton candy. Just imagine liquifying cotton candy and putting it on your body. It leaves you smelling sweet and very, very sticky. I threw the bottle away, useless."
2,Nice not oily,Mine didn't smell like much but like the fact it's not oily and organic using it for my 4 year old skin is soft but wished it smelled like the reviews said but doesn't fast shipping
5,great product,"I chose this product because it doesn't contain the chemical byproducts that baby oil does. It is a similar texture to baby oil, but with thicker consistency and not as greasy. The smell is great. And it works well to moisturize"
5,One of my top 5 must have products!,This Kukui Nut oil is so great I've bought it for several of my friends and they become fans too. Great for summer beach time and definitely a must for winter skin. This is one of my top 5 must have products in the beauty department!
5,Amazing!!,"This product is amazing! It works from HEAD TO TOE and leaves your skin silky smooth, soft, and smelling fresh all day long. I also use it in my natural black (dredlock) hair as a moisturizing and herbal oil and it works just the same--without any greasy build-up in my hair or scalp. I also use it the same way on my 3 year old son, and we both agree, ""It smells really good!"" The scent is ""almondy""--delicate, but not too overpowering. Also, what I like about the bottle is that the special design of the cap allows it to drip out rather than gush out. You can squeeze the bottle harder for increased flow, if you desire. I'm a happy customer with this product and will definitely purchase it again as well as sample other Alba Hawaiian products. Thanks!!:)"
3,OK but..,"I was hoping for a much lighter weight massage oil.This was nice smelling, but a little thick.Probably good for moisturizing dry skin."
2,inaccurate list of ingredients,"The online product description list of ingredients has ""botanical fragrance"" at the end, implying fragrance from a natural source. The actual bottle says Fragrance(parfum) which most likely indicates a petroleum synthesized fragrance ."
4,Works and smells amazing,"Very light oil and it really does work, I put it on right after the shower and I feel like eating my arm. I only wish it came with a pump"
2,Oil,Not all the ingredients are organic. Kukui Nut oil is like the 4th ingredient. Not scented with essential oils- fragrance oils are not organic.
2,Misleading Labeling - Not pure Kakui Oil,"This oil has kukui oil as one of the ingredients ... it is NOT pure kukui oil.The product description says ""Kukui Nut Organic Body Oil"".Read the ingredients before buying."
1,wasted my money!,"I didn't remember the add making mention of the fact that if you don't live in Europe, your not going to be able to view the Blu-ray.... I opened the movie to view, so I couldn't return it. As of right now the movie in in some trash dump, what a waste of hard eared money!"
2,My least favorite KMK album,"I have been a KMK fan for about seven years now, and I own all their albums. This one is pretty mediocre, in my opinion. There are three or four pretty good tracks, but the rest sound too similar and run together. The beats sound the same, and the punk songs are kind of bland. This album is probably the closest the Kings have come to sounding mainstream. KMK albums I recommend are Hidden Stash II, Cloud Nine, Rollin Stoned, and Koast II Koast."
5,killah,"before i went and got this cd, i read the top 2 reviews on this page that said the cd suckt. and i was slightly dissapointed but i bought it neways cuz i own all of there cds. i listened to it the whole way thru and thought dam.. this cd definatly does not suck. i think it is one of their best cds to date. they sound nothing like lil jon or any other rapper ppl. so go out n buy tha cd cuz it rox"
5,One Word: OHMYGOOOOOOOOOOOOD~!,"This CD is _banging_. Just simply motherfluffing _banging_. From start to finish it's hard the whole way through. All three MC's spit some tight verses. Bobby B drops the bass like an old pro. Lou Dog's drums are nuts. JUst the whole things is unbelievable. Knew the disc was going to be good, but not _this_ good.GET BETTER D-LOC~! I WANNA SEE KMK LIVE EVEN MORE THANKS TO THIS DISC~!= Delaney* Personal Fav. So Far: We Got the Chronic"
1,HORRIBLE,I cant believe that these guys are still around I figured they would have broken up after the first album. seriously how many albums can you release with the same lame lyrics about smokin pot and how much you hate the government. WE GET THE JOKE ALREADY YOU SMOKE POT. As far as this album goes this is one of the weakest most watered down attempts I have ever heard. the music sounds like a bunch of fake gangsta wannabe white boys trying really hard to sound like little john and the east side boys. They sound like they are really trying to get that MTV or radio hit by doing the fake gangsta thing. If you want an MC who actually has skills foget about ICP and KMK and check out CAN-I-BUS or COMMON Hands down the worst CD of 2005.
1,"horrible product, won't come off","If you use this product, plan on leaving it in your hair for a very long time. It does not come off with water, water and soap, shampoo."
5,Silky smooth,The arrrangements are silky smooth and the presentation is engaging and wonderful. This is a collection of songs that begs to be played with the repeat switch on your player so that you can enjoy the music and the fine mood that it puts you into.
5,Best Notebook around today,This is my first Sony notebook and I love it. I have always had Thinkpads. This is the pefect size and weight for a business traveller like me.
1,Sony Vaio's clearly defective,Sony Vaio's are a defective product and should not be sold. Once you have a problem customer service/repairs/refunds are non existant and they repeatedly get you off the phone telling you that they will have someone call you back. Never yet a call back! DON'T buy the Sony Vaio and if you do or have please file a complaint with the BBB online.
2,Wow,"Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The editing, the special effects, the home video quality feel was just ridiculous. Dana Plato (from Different Strokes), Miles O'Keefe & Joe Esteves starred in this disaster. If you wish to be entertained, I would give this a shot. You won't believe your eyes."
5,One of Johnny's finest albums ever!,"Well friends, if there was ever a Johnny Cash album that is true country, this is it. All these great versions of country standards such as My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You, Time Changes Everything, Honky Tonk Girl and the rest are very well done. This is indeed a different Johnny Cash style but like that other reviewer said he is in excellent shape on this album. I wish Johnny recorded more country albums like this, but I think every Cash fan will enjoy this album. I guess back in those days people were so uptight about using words like Cocaine in a song, that's why he had to change it to Transfusion Blues. Now you will hear Johnny's famous style with Luther Perkins on guitar, etc. Enjoy!"
5,My husband loves it.,"There are song here that my husband had forgotten and loved in the past. Cash does a great job singing country wester tunes; however, he didn't record that many. Would definitely recommed it to Johnny Cash fans."
2,No coupler provided!!,This polisher requires a special coupler for your water hose. NOBODY carries this special coupler so you have to order it online.
3,.,"My order came in at the time expected. The tape is weird. You can't hear the music in the backround that you can on all my other Walk Away the Pounds videos. I dont think that has anything to do with who sent it, the video is just old. Thanks."
4,Great Early Morning Workout,"I purchased Leslie's ""Too Busy to Workout"" video years ago and it was perfect to start out with. I began with the 15 minutes and soon progressed to longer and more difficult videos. I still use it when I only have 15 minutes to work out. So, with that in mind, I purchased this video and I am absolutely in love with it! It is fun and yet you know that you have worked out. I work out in the mornings before work and this is perfect for me! I am going to purchase the 3 mile workout now! I highly recommend this video to beginners and the more accomplished!"
4,Simple but effective workout,"This workout is very good for toning your muscles and burning calories; however, I would get bored if I did it everyday. It has has minimal variety compared to other workout programs (dance-based aerobics, etc.), and I like variety. Still, this tape is a great workout for those days when I don't feel like thinking and trying to remember the next step/combo. Also, during the summer, it is great, because you can walk inside in the air conditioning and only break a light sweat! Just a note--if you buy this tape by itself, make sure you purchase two pound weights. You will need them if you want to make your arm toning more effective."
1,I'll never own another Motorola Product,"It's very frustrating when you invest money in technology and it doesn't work. I owned the Startac for 3 years and the battery never held a charge for any amount of time. We bought 3 replacements batteries and a charging stand. With all three fully charged it was only enough power for about 5 phone calls.I am really happy with my Nokia. It's totally sweet, much better software, better hardware and best of all...I charge it every other day and it always works.Don't waste you money on this product."
4,One of Saul's best,"I read this back in the early 80's & loved it. I just re-read it recently & it's still a good story. I really think this novel was ahead of it's time w/ genetic experimentation & all the computer stuff.I wouldn't call it a typical horror (no super natural). It has more of a government conspiracy/X-files theme going on. So if you like that you might enjoy the book. Plus, it has a really good ending that won't disappoint you."
2,Needs repair days after purchase,"Considering the variety of quality watches available on the market in this price range, I was surprised that my Khaki King Automatic refuses to function as an automatic just days after being purchased. Whether wound manually or left to work as an automatic, mine hangs up with the second hand sticking on the minute hand when the minute hand is pointing in the vicinity of the ""6"" (I know -- sounds weird). This occurs even though I wear the watch all the time. I've yet to resolve the problem either through the store or through customer service, but so far so bad -- not what it was advertised to be, and not a very good exercise in quality control by Hamilton."
5,Smokin' From Start to Finish,"This CD starts out strong and keeps delivering throughout. Gritty at times, persistently engaging and toe tapping. Actually, your whole body is going to be moving as you listen to this one.Slow walkin/talkin blues at times, with a deep reach for meaning in delivery transitions back to kick-a** blues with gusto.I'm planning to see John in March (Bath, ME) and this is great preparation."
5,Great soundAlthough I am not a major Blues fan,"Although not a major Blues fan,I could easily be, if all Blues albums had the beat and content of this one!"
3,Boring,My 3 year old is a big fan of Mighty Machines. I thought for sure he'd love this one since it shows a lot of big equipment but he has never watched it all the way through and he'll pick any number of Mighty Machine videos over this one.
5,My Grandson loves it,"The purchase was great and fast delivier. The biggest thing is my grandson enjoys the movie when he comes over. These are great for all kids to see the differnet machines that are out there. Thank you, Brian"
5,Good teaching DVD,I bought this for my 3 yr. old grandson in another state. My daughter says he asks to watch this everyday. He just loves to watch it. It works for me!
4,"15"" planer review",The planer works great even on the toughest white oakdid not notice any loss of powerand produced a perfect cut without much snipe
2,not up its price,"The Delta 380 Planer costs a lot of money and has proved to be one of the poorer machines in my shop. My biggest beef is the cutterhead is totally out of alignment (out of parallel) with the bed, hence lumber passes through twisting itself sideways, and the finished stock is thicker on one edge than it is on the other. Reajustments are a bear! Additionally, knife changes are tedious and the infeed outfeed extention beds are not much better than garbage. This has been the biggest disappointment of my shop. Certainly not worth the money."
1,If you have the time,"I purchased this planer in January with high hopes for performance. I did read the reviews and knew going in it was low and heavy. After unloading and setting up it is not ready to go, you must adjust, adjust, and if that not enough you can adjust some more one of the many different adjustments. If you are thinking about buying this item download the manual and see if you want to deal with all the adjustments. If someone would take this off my hand where I could buy another planer come get it."
4,Great addition,"Great addition to my shop out of the box ready.Only problem was getting the Delta rebate it took 4 month and help from Amazon tool crib to get a check. need to watch rebate offer. Amazon ""Mike""was great to deal with"
4,Scientific Research,"Opportunities in Research and Development explains that research and development are at the very heart of all scientific venues: biological and medical sciences, agricultural sciences, physical sciences, computer and mathematical sciences and the social sciences. Each chapter speaks to one of these scientific areas listing well known occupations as well as other subspecialties, education and training, work environment, salaries, professional associations, and addresses for additional information."
5,Pleasure Sensitive,Fabulous! Great Work! Tony you definitely having the makings of a world renowned jazz musician.
5,I agree-this bible should not be out of print,"Like the lady in the other review, I too have a banged up copy of this book -- mine is in a zip lock baggie because it fell apart due to overuse. As a self publisher, wouldn't you like to know that someone has used YOUR book like that? Thanks to John Kremer, there are a lot of successful little publishers out there."
2,"Great music, terrible sound quality","This recording, which I purchased on CD, does a great injustice to Tony Bennett. The sound of his voice is far lower than that of the big band that accompanies him. I listened to this CD on several different players and his great voice is consistently drowned out. Instead of this one, I'd recommend Sinatra's or Crosby's Christmas albums."
5,Tony Bennett and one cool Christmas C.D.!!,"If you enjoy the cool and uptown Christmas sounds from Tony Bennett, then I know you will enjoy this C.D. from the artist Frank Sinatra enjoyed listening to. There are some great tracks including ""Snowfall"", ""Winter Wonderland"" and the track that appeared on an MTV program, ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". It's great to listen to!"
3,"Good Treatment of Standards...some poor selections, though","There's no way around it...Bennett nails most of these songs. The standards get a treatment that may well set a new standard for them.""My Favorite Things"" gets a great Jazzy treatment. You can't help but snap your fingers to it...its a delight. The two medleys are sewn together very nicely. And he gives Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby a run for their money with their standards.However, two songs are nearly unlistenable...""Christmas Land"" and ""Snowfall"" (the title cut). I will try to be kind, but even Bennett's silver tongue can't rescue ""Christmas Land"". Ick!Overall...recommended."
2,Depressing,"While Tony is one of the best singers of any century, the song selection is not too ""christmasy."" Actually I found it depressing and annoying. I was disappointed and surprised. ADVICE: Stick with any other Tony album!"
4,I Like it!,"Each year, I pick up a new Christmas CD or two to add to my very diverse Christmas music collection and make my own compilation CDs of favorites to listen to in the car and around the house. I always search for something that stands out above the other music I usually hear. This year, I've heard this CD's version of ""I'll be home for Christmas"" many times on a local radio station that's playing all Christmas and Holiday music throughout the season. It really has a great swing to it and it stands out among many great versions of this song. Tony's voice has a really cool warmth and slight edge to it in these recent years and it really adds a lot to this performance, which is making this CD a definite need for my collection. The other songs sound good in the audio samples too, although I prefer his upbeat stuff with the voice of recent years best."
4,"This is good, really good","This was recorded while Tony was at his peak, and so this is smooth singing at its best. I can't quite place him up with Bing and some of the others, but this is an album that should please most people who appreciate the older style of song.""Snowfall"" does have to rate as probably the best here, but ""White Christmas"" and ""I'll Be Home For Christmas, along with ""My Favorite Things"" and ""Christmas Song"", each have unique charm."
3,Lazy Mastering,"C'mon Sony! Put at least a little effort into your Christmas reissues! I own this and both Andy Williams Sony titles, and they did the same thing to all three - They sapped the life out of the recordings by filtering out the highest frequencies to reduce the tape hiss. They could have reduced the hiss by utilizing other methods, but that would have required effort. I guess Sony doesn't take their Christmas offerings very seriously."
5,The best,"The best voice, classic christmas but fresh. Classic Tony. Jazzy, upbeat, sweet. Makes me smile. Good for a party or by the fire with your sweetheart."
1,"Has some errors, and some areas are way to detailed for what you need for the USMLE","This book is advertised as being 128 pages, but it is actually only 104 pages (which includes 2 blank pages). There are some charts/graphs/tables that really aren't necessary for the book, but were probably added to try and pump up the page count. In reality, all the biostats you need could be covered in 50 pages or less (including some practice questions), but I suppose the author and publisher couldn't justify charging $29.95 for something that small.Worst of all, I found a few errors. I'd list them here, but then I'd feel like I'm working for free for the author and publisher."
4,Good product - love the one touch pickup,"This product is good because of the one touch pickup - i do not even have open up my v60 to dial now! I can use the one touch dial do scroll the 10 recently dialed numbers. Sound quality is pretty good, better than all the other ones i have had before. Good product...I recommend."
4,"One touch button, handy but ""touchy""","I bought this headset for use with my Motorola V60c phone. The one touch button allows you to dial the last number, hang up or even send codes (programmed after a wait code) without touching the phone -- a good safety feature.That being said, the button pressure is a bit hard to determine -- press too hard and it hangs up, too little and it does not activate. The touch of the Motorola headset with built-in radio is better, but that headset is much too large and awkward to use regularly.Earphone is comfortable and sound quality is good."
4,Best Multi Vitamin I've Found,I've finally found a mulit-vitamin that is all natural provides what my body needs and causes no ill side affects.
3,HIS NOVELS ARE BETTER,"I thought I'd really like this collection. But I was disappointed. I love Tessier but think he really lets out the dark and perverse in his novels, whereas his short fiction -- with the exception of about a fourth of these tales -- fall a little flat. Still better than many authors, more thought-provoking..."
2,Hanes,"Was way smaller and tighter then it looks. I'm a size 10 and got an XL and it was still too snug. Works great under a t-shirt, but alone, not so much!"
4,COCKBURN AND FRIENDS MAKE MAGIC,"IF YOU LOVE LIVE STUDIO SONGS BY TALENTED SINGER/SONGWRITERS...THIS IS IT...AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE SHEET MUSIC TO ""CRY OF A TINY BABE"" PLEASE SEND IT THIS WAY"
2,excellent book; horrrible edition,"the treatise is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, but the Nortons have done a disservice to the academic community with this edition. their editorial section, which comprises a solid third of this edition, is extremely subpar. i've even heard that many Hume scholars have demanded that Oxford recall the critical text that was published as a companion to this edition. the oxford edition of the enquiry's is just fine, but i would recommend the sellby-bigges edition of the treatise instead of this one."
1,Worthless,"If you're in the market for a paperback doorstop, don't hesitate to drop eight bucks on this dandy model. Mine didn't come with ""fancy"" accessories like page numbers, notes, or an index, just plenty of typos as it's just a copy and paste job from the internet version. Literally. I can thank the diabolical folks at ""Loki's Publishing"" for this POS. I even complained to Amazon and got a refund without having to mail it back (which of course would have cost even more money).They then recommended Oxford's edition. Type in this ISBN in Amazon's search window: 0198751729.Hope this helps."
2,Misadvertised/mis-linked to different edition,"This was not the edition I wanted, as follows: I initially found the desired edition, including a photo of the cover, followed the links for available copies, including this one which I purchased (which, BTW, did not have a photo of cover, but I assumed it was same edition as on the initial page). Was dismayed to receive this different edition. It matters because it was for a friend's college course. Professors often reference pages in the assigned edition, which do not correspond to another edition's page numbering. Please minimize such confusion by more accurate advertising (include a cover photo on every linked page, to ensure it matches the initial one) or more accurate linking--i.e. don't show a specific search result but then link to other books that are not the same one, unless again, there are cover photos or other info displayed to distinguish them."
2,?,"I have to say that high school musical is one of the Corniest movies I HAVE EVER seen ,The Actors cant act nor Sing i think only around 2 actors can actually act . Poor cast List, but the only good thing about it is the songs That are very good some of them.I hope the 2nd one Is MUCH MUCH Better then the first one."
5,It rules!,"I love this movie.Me and my cousin Jenifer are fans and have the same High School Musical screensaver.I also love the song ""I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"".It's a never before seen but i've listened to it.I also heard that many people in Worcester watch the movie."
5,Wonderful!!,"This is a great movie! It picks you up in it's gentle song in the beginning and takes you on a whirlwind, not setting you down until the end with a warm feeling inside--the feeling you get after watching a great, enchanting classic.The acting, the dancing, the singing...WOW!!! These teens are GREAT at what they do!The final scene/dance number is...WOW...again! I haven't seen dancing like THAT for a very long time!I love the old musicals (Singin' in the Rain, King and I...), and this movie is right there with them in the way of favorites. Best movie EVER!!!"
5,Really great entertainment,"This movie is not about the quality of the singing or the lyrics or the acting which are all great in my book! It is good, _CLEAN_ fun for kids of all ages (my 5 and 7 1/2 year olds LOVE it!) when that is so hard to come by these days. I am extremely picky/cautious when it comes to what my kids can watch and this passes with flying colors. It has a great message and, did I mention it was very entertaining? Very highly recommended."
1,I don't get it.,"I really don't get how such a bad movie(in my opinion) can become such a huge hit. No offense, HSM lovers, but I can't stand this movie. I've seen it all at a friend's house, and everything about it is so annoying! The songs are terrible, the actors/actresses aren't even very good, and plot is just bad.Trust me, if you don't like bad songs, a bad plot, and bad acting, then don't waste your time. Skip High School Musical. It's a waste of your money and your time. But, if you're still interested, still don't buy it. At least watch it at a friend's house or rent the DVD, or see it on Disney Channel. But don't waste your money. Just my opinion."
2,Not Exactly My Cup of Tea,"Okay, so I don't actually drink tea. But I must admit, I really don't care for this movie that much. Personally, I don't understand what all the hoopla's about concerning HSM. Sure, the songs are not bad, and the actors are kinda cute, and you gotta give those guys credit for putting a lot of time and effort into this movie. But for some reason, this little teenybopper flick just doesn't turn me on like it seems to do with everyone else. Just about everywhere I turn, it's always ""High School Musical this"" and ""High School Musical that"", and all I can say is: ""Give me a break."""
4,"I let the kids rate this one, since they are the target audience, I think","My personal opinion is that this reminded me of Grease but many parents might not consider that movie appropriate for a young audience. This is an excellent alternative and the consensus of the kids who saw it was that it was wonderful. They watched it again and again and....well, you get the idea.I'm a fan of musicals. If you aren't, then you will not find this to your liking. I have a feeling this one will stand the test of time and become a cult favorite as time passes, much the way Grease became iconic for a certain time and year."
1,Pretty Horrible,"What do you get when you put bad actors with bad music? High School Musical.With it's hilariously bad plot and put-to-sleep music, this movie is sure to bore anyone under the age of 10."
1,THIS MOVIE IS EVERY BAD THING I CAN SAY!!!!!!!!!,"Why would you do this to anyone? This movie is a crime to humanity. The so called ""music"" is completely abominatable, and the characters are so clueless and just plain stupid that the movie becomes unbarable! The plot line is extremely predictable. This movie is a tipical pointless childrens film. And they wonder why children intelligents is going down hill. THIS IS THE REASON! Please never never watch this film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's for your own good!!!!"
1,ok.....erm....next!,"Trust me on this....this movie stinks. All the songs in this movie are terrible. The songs got stuck in my head and I cant get them out. Terrible acting is in this one. Ashely Tidstale (or whatever)is a good actor in Suite life of Zack and Cody, but then again, she did terrible in this movie.,Another thing, if you are chosen to star in a disney movie...dont. Once you do, your stuck with disney. I saw Zak Efron on like 5 disney shows. Im not kidding.Over all, High School Musical gets shot down and they other auditions win...you know what Im getting at?:/ ok Ill stop"
1,There's nothing like A GOOD musical...,"...and this is NOTHING LIKE a good musical.Adults should be warned to stay clear of this dreary exercise at ALL costs. This is time better spent with an insurance agent or doing your taxes. (Yes...It's THAT bad.)If you have tweens at home and they clamour for this abomination, be warned, it never ends. Long after the movie has finished there is the CD of the film's unmemorable soundtrack which can only lead to the sequels (2 of them at this writing.) and the ripoffs. (AMERICAN MALL anyone?)Do yourself a favor and run far and fast when the kiddies get a yen to pop this one in the old dvd player or you'll be visiting your dentist to fix the damage caused from grinding your teeth."
1,Plastic People,"I LOVE movies about high school kids---Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Bring It On. Thought this movie would be similar. Instead, incredibly boring. Plastic people. Just evaluate each character as you see them: if great looking (a 10), then character is a good guy/gal; if not, then an non-entity or a bad guy/gal.Have NEVER given eval anywhere re: a movie, & probably only giving this one b/c I was stupid enough to order HSM & HSM2 from Amazon at same time. After seeing HSM, knew a BIG mistake. Watching HSM2 right now, & I rest my case.NO IDEA how popular these movies were when released, but if popular, SCARY.No individuality re: characters. All PLASTIC stereotypes. Boring. Boring."
1,Soylent Dick Says: Apallingly bland movie with dreadful music,"I would have thought that the whole point of 'High School Musical' would be the music.Well, as a trained musician, and one who has written my own material, and directed high school musicals, I have to say that the music in HSM was WOEFUL!!!! Whoever wrote these numbers has no talent for writing tunes whatsoever, or (more concerning), they were under instructions to write the most bland, innane trash they could think of.The fact that so many people thought it was great, is of real concern. It shows the inability of so many people to recognize the difference between good and bad music (and these people are allowed to vote!). To some extent this is a matter of taste, but I do not know any trained musicians who would say anything good about HSM.The acting and the story followed a similar vein - all reflective of the Disney factory which produces an idealistic, squeaky-clean world of prestine beauty which doesn't exist."
1,Depressing,"I cannot figure out how Disney is still in business, considering its complete downward spiral into creative bankruptcy -- much less how this sad movie managed to spread in popularity like it has, virus-like. This is the nothing more than the sort of useless, talentless pabulum that Disney's team of shackled-down writers now hack out on a regular basis so that their soulless overseer will feed them.What happened to my Disney -- the Disney who made Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King, and Aladdin?"
3,"Movie great, disappointed in DVD release","The movie is great and I love watching it with my 7 year old daughter. However, my daughter eagerly awaited the DVD knowing that there was a ""learning the moves"" portion of it. BUT, Disney royally screwed up by putting Bop to the Top instead of the hit finale ""We're All In This Together"" for the dance moves section. I would recorded the one from TV where they taught the dance moves to ""We'er All In This Together"" and saved my money on the DVD!!!!VERY disappointed in the DVD release. But then Disney is famous for that!!!!"
4,Liked it,"I liked this movie and I like all 3 or mostly. But, there's like an immodest and innappropriate song, Gabriella flirts with Troy, but I still like it. If you're a girl from 7-12 or so you may like it too. (maybe even boys, teens and adults)"
4,"""The Start of Something New""","""The start of something new"" This is the first song that the two main characters sing. High School musical is accually pretty good movie. When I first watched High school musical was very scepticle because I am not a very big fan of musicals. In the end I was impressed with it.Just by looking at High school musical you might think that it is a movie only kids like however it is surprisely entertaining!!"
3,Decent for what it is- Fantasy,"It's a movie full of catchy songs, fun dances, cliche dialog, and passable acting by real teens playing teens.However I have a concern about the overall message.I can see why the overt message about cliques is popular, but getting that message from watching the lives of incredibly rich kids in a world where the biggest problems are cliques, made it seem shallow. We're all in this together...those of us with money anyway. We're all stars...since we have enough money, a great school, and lots of equipment, and parental involvement. I think upholding this vision as an ideal fantasy, strengthens class divisions between people."
5,High School Musical,"When I first heard about High School Musical, I was thinking ""not another Disney movie"". But I forced myself to watch it. I really don't regret it. I now own the DVD and CD. For those who don't know what HSM is all about, here's the topic: Gabriella (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), a super-smart girl, and Troy (Zac Effron), team captain of the basketball team, find their pasion for singing. Troy is afraid what his teammates could think about his singing, but he still auditions with Gabriella. As dramaqueen Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) finds out that they have callbacks, she makes plans to ruin their performance. Inbetwenn, there are some good, some not-so-good songs. My favorite songs in the movie is definitly ""When There Was Me And You"". I love the film, but I still have a few questions:-Why were the outfits in ""Bop To The Top"""" so - different?-What was actually the theme of the ""Twinkle Town"" musical. The songs were all so different?Not considering those questions - 5 stars!"
4,Great movie!,"This is an excellent family movie. Disney has made some instant stars out of these young actors! The story is cute, the song are catchy and the actors are really good. I'm looking forward to High School Musical 2."
4,It's so much fun!,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it! It reminds me of those classic musicals like ""Grease"", but iwith a nice modern twist to it. It's not cheesy, the dialogues are full with funny punch-lines and the cast is amazing! I think we will be earing a lot from Zac Efron in the near future! Can't wait to see High School Musical 2!"
4,My daughter loves this,"This is like a G-rated Grease. My daughter who is six loves this movie. She likes all the music and sings along with it. Good movie for girls, but I think parents can only take so much of it."
4,Do they really sing?,"I need a little help over here!I know it might sound stupid, but I what to know if are the actors who really sing or if their voices are manipulated with the computer?If someone got a clue on this, please let me know!Thanks,Malena"
5,YAY!!!!!!!,High School Musical is coming to dvd!I`m soooo excited!It`s a great movie!I`m going to ask my mom if I can pre-order it!
1,IT BLOWS CHUNKS!!,"This should hardly be considered a ""musical"". It mostly consists of crappy Pop music. Additionally, the songs are badly written. The people singing them make ""Barney & Friends"" look like Oscar-winning material. The plot is also very stupid and predictable. I'm one of many individuals who find great distaste for these crappy made-for-television Disney movies. If you want a musical that's actually GOOD, go watch ""The Producers"" (both 1967 and 2005 versions) instead. This is just CRAP!"
1,This is why the terrorists hate us,"Perhaps the only thing impressive at all about this musical is the fact that it has proved to be so monumentally successful despite being little more than an over-hyped Disney TV movie. Financed with Old Man Walt's Nazi gold, High School Musical takes formulaic trash to a new level of mediocrity. It was the smash hit that was never supposed to happen, a straight-to-DVD exercise in tween-sploitation that got blown out of proportion by ironic hipsters. Thanks to them, this piece of forgettable pap became 'cult viewing', and soon enough everyone was riding the bandwagon, and apparently forgot that it was all a sick joke concocted by studio executives, the Internet and Satan. The overwhelming success of High School Musical is a testament to the unforgivable folly of mankind, and for this reason alone the very thought of it chills me to my core. I mean, there's a character called Sharpay! Sharpay! I weep for this generation."
1,Walt Disney Keeps Turning In His Coffin,"This movie basically gives a retrospective of what Disney has become lately. The movie is definitely marketed to elementary level kids and possibly preteens. The plot is cheap and predictable, it's basically a watered down version of Grease, and it has absolutely nothing to deal with real high school life. The actors blow, but hey, it's Disney, what do you expect? If you've ever watched a Disney Channel movie, they basically regurgitated those types of people. This movie is basically Disney's way of increasing the amount of cash they receive, and it makes me sick. Boycott anything recent that Disney has done, because it lacks value, creativity, and the strength it had decades ago."
2,stupidly addicting for people,"High school musical is stupid. People love it and it is the same as any other disney movie. Everyone only likes it because they like Zac Efron. I am a girl and I hate it. Being ""crazy"" for not liking it at school is stupid. All I hear is ""This movie is the best!"" or ""I'm going to marry Zac Efron"" or ""I am this movie's number one fan"". It is an okay movie but too addicting for so many people, especially girls. It is better for people too spread out and I've heard people making a big deal at school if you don't like this movie. It is hurting to get your feelings hurt or even brake your friendships."
2,"Well, the story line was good...","alright I know this is going to effect my reviewer rank but i can't leave this unsaid, I CAN'T STAND DISNEY ANYMORE!!!! I used to love disney before they got all the teenager relationships!!! It did have a good story line so I'll give some credit to disney for that. if you like teenager sappy romance I guess you""ll love this. I mean no offence to anyone who likes this movie so please don't say this was an unhelpful review. I am just saying what I think."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"I absolutely despise this film. When I saw the previews, I thought it would be an alright film. So, I watched it one night and boy, it is truly terrible. It is totally crappy. Great musicals are like Chicago, Rent, and Phantom of the Opera. Why bother having Disney Channel put the worst actors ever in a dumb film? I mean, just because Zac Efron was in Summerland, doesn't mean he's a star. And Ashley Tisdale, people just like her because she's in The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, which sucks. And the plot, oh my gosh! This fat basketball player auditions for a stupid play. How dumb could it get? People like the songs soooo much. Breaking free is so uncatchy. One question though, why do people like this movie so flippin' much? It's stupid. I have no idea why High School Musical is on the cover of every magazine. Overall, this movie sucks. Do not buy it! Repeat. Do not buy it!"
2,boring and... silly!,"This movie has no content, the dancing is not that good, nor the acting the acting is horrible. Zac Efron is NOT a hottie he is a idiot who can't act(and can't smile). HSM has hardly any plot, and is all fluff. It is a worldly movie and i would NOT reccomend it, at all."
3,Classic but not as good as 3rd,I like this movie since it was the first but I am sad that Zac Efron does not actually sing his part.
4,Sit Back And Relax,"This is a very pleasant DVD. Though very unrealistic, with the beautiful clean school and lots of cool decent people, it is very nice to just watch and let your worries slip away. The music is very upbeat and cheerful, and though there is a plot, most of the events will make you smile, laugh, or just feel good inside. All in all, this is a very enjoyable DVD.Note: -not recommended for people who are completely against preppy traditions or pop music-"
2,Professionally done pablum,"This movie had to have something going for it to garner so many fans, and I believe it's this: the crisp, super-clean production values. And ya know, the dancing ain't bad. But is there a less believable ""basketball star"" than Zac Efron? Hey, I'm 58 years old and I could probably beat this guy one on one. The plot may have been simple, but given the target audience (6-10 year olds), it's appropriate that it lacks anything challenging, like irony. Real high school actors hate this movie, or love it because it's so bad. If you've actually seen a well-done high school musical, you understand why: while the villains here are faintly amusing, the less talented principals are strictly baby formula. Swallow it down, kids, and pay no attention to Zac and Vanessa as they laugh their way to the bank."
4,Great Musical,"I personally think that this is a great show for all ages. It has a great cast, and although there are definately a few cheesy moments, all considered it was great. I was fairly skeptical at first, especially after hearing the songs in the hallway so much, but I finally decided to sit down and watch it.I was floored.I couldn't believe how much I loved it. So even if you're skeptical about watching it, I would DEFINATELY suggest that you watch/rent/buy it."
2,I don't think so.,"This movie has good acting,a good message and the dancing is amazing!But the story's corny,some of the songs are weird and Zac Efron is everywhere!!! His picture is on,like 5 shirts!If Troy was played by a boy with a mullet,braces,and 5000 zits would this movie be as popular?I don't think so."
5,Fantastically Disney-esque!!,"This movie soooo appeals to the kid in all of us!! It really is amazing just how huge it has become, but to say (as has been said) that the movie made stars out of the actors is probably not as true as to say that it is the ACTORS that made the movie. But, in the interests of not getting bogged down in trifles, all I can say is that you should just see this movie. Really, you should.The music, the acting, the dancing, the singing...it's all come together in such a fantastically disney-esque way for this film, and it's so much fun to watch over and over again. I've probably seen it at least 25 times. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get tired of it either. Neither will you!!I'm sure the shadow of this giant will loom for generations to come. Looking forward to HSM2!!!"
2,uh...,"When I saw this movie my friends told me that it was so great...so I saw it. I've never been so dissapointed before, it make me laugh in some parts but the rest was so boring. When the movie finished I only sayed one thing: Uhhh..."
2,Boo - Big Disappointment,"DVD Releases are meant to add meaningful extras to the movie. In this case, the behind the scenes segment and the dancing segment (only includes Bop to the Top) were very thin. My family loved the movie when released on TV (we watched each version). The extras in the DVD added very little that we had not already seen on TV. Even my 8 year old asked to write a letter of complaint to Disney. Disney definitely mailed in this one after a superb effort on the original release."
2,Fab Movie,"It's a wonderful movie, but my little brother and I were extremely disappointed in the bonus features. The commercials for it hyped up the ""fact"" that there's a dance-along version. There's a featurette, but it only shows one dance. And it's a stupid one. If there are more dances, please email me to tell me where to find them... Until then, I say that the movie itself is wonderful but the DVD is horrid. If they put out another version like they did with the CD, I'm going to be furious."
4,High School Musical,"I just wanted to let 'yall know that High School Musical was the best movie I ever saw, on Disney Channel. Zac Efron is HOT! But I have a question, what other shows has he appeared on?"
1,Horrible,"This is the stupidest movie I've ever seem in my entire life. Ashley Tisdale has a horrible whiny eight year old voice. Vanessa Ann Hudgens also has a stupid whiny bratty voice. The plot is so amazingly predictable. Everyone that has a brain knows that everything is gonna go perfect. They're all gonna win all of their stupid things that they have to do like whoever Vanessa Ann Hudgens plays wins her geek compition, Troy wins his basketball game, and they win the audition. I knew what was gonna happen before I saw the movie. I can't see how anyone could like this at all. I feel sorry for all of the people that for some stupid twisted reason have a crush on the guy that plays Troy because he doesn't like girls if you know what I mean. I really hope you know what I mean because I'm not gonna say it right out unless someone gets down on their knees and begs me. You might think that I'm making this up because I don't like him but he announced it on some T.V. show most likely a talk show."
2,What is This,Okay this is a corny movie. Thsi is the kinda movie for prepubescent little girls. They'll watch this and think this is what highschool is really like until they mature they'll realize what garbage they were watching. I like Ashley Tisdale's voice it's cutebut I hate Vanessa this movie is so fake and bubblely fluff
4,"Outstanding, yet old!","This movie was totaly awesome, the first 500 times! I love the movie but i mean, they show it on TV WAY to much. could they milk it anymore?"
1,high school musical encore edition,Boo. I was extremely diappointed that the dance-along was not included. Perhaps it will be available soon at extra cost?Flower in SF
1,bad dvd,The whole sing-along section of my DVD won't work. I think that it has something to do with when the movie was written onto my dvd. I am sad that I can't sing-along to the songs that I don't know the words to yet.
4,"The musical is fun, Zac is great - but why in SmallScreen","This musical turned out much better than I expected, it's fun and full of energy. I already liked Zac in ""Summerland"", but he showed so much more talent in this one. He has amazing charisma.What really stinks about this DVD-release is the 1:1,33-picture. Is Disney really SO backwards - or do they just hope to sell another version in widescreen later? HELLO Disney - no one wants this antique format. The making-of shows that the movie was shot in widescreen - so why not put it out this way?However thanks for the 5.1-sound! From the picture format Disney choose one has to be glad it's not in mono-sound!Apart from this technical drop-back, I can recommend this musical to anyone who wants to have funfilled 100 minutes."
5,A Great movie,Disney Channel always makes good movies but there are a few that i think are just a waste of film. High school musical is disney's best one so far. My friends and i have fights over who has Zac. We also watch this movie at all of our sleepovers and i cant wait till this movie comes to DVD.
5,High School Musical,Thank you for sending the dvd out is such a timely manner. I appreciate your quick service. Product in original packaging. Thanks.
5,Good movie,"Got this for my daughter, she was the happiest girl alive! She is in love with ""Troy""! Nice to have a musical that kids like and teaches good things as well"
4,catchy songs,"My daughter loves this movie, not because she follows the plot (there is a lot she doesn't get) but because of the songs. She had heard them on Radio Disney, but seeing the movie gave her new ""dance"" moves to try. She is having a blast! I must admit that I have caught myself singing the songs too."
5,FUN FUN FUN,"I bought this item for my niece who loved the movie when it came out and she couldn't stop watching it (she's probably watched it a thousands times by now) and singing along the songs. So, what better way to give her a great present for Xmas. Now she can sing another thousand times over....and she is loving it!!!"
5,WOW!,This is disney channel's best movie.I have to agree with the kid who said they hate cow belles.That movie really did stink.I bet highschoolmusical2 will be better than the first.I comes out next year.Good job disney!
4,Okay,"I have seen this film twice and would watch it again and again. Its unbelievably cheesy and not at all real but come on its from the Disney Channel!!! And it has Zac Effron in it, what more do you really need to watch this movie. Kids will love it and most of the bad reviews on here are from adults, was it really made to entertain the older generation?Its certainly not the worst film in the world, may i remind you of ""Open Water""you know the one where you watch 1hr of water and 2 people bobbing about. High School Musical is a kids film aimed at kids, simple as that."
3,Pretty good for a disney movie!,"Ok so the movie itself is def not bad. you could even say the songs are pretty catchy. The acting is not bad either except for Ashley Tisdales character. I cant take her seriously because she goes so far over the top. People dont actually act like that. Zac Efron and Vanessa and Lucas arent bad actors and they pretty much fit the part. As far as singing goes the only person who could actually sing was Lucas. I am not overly critical of peoples voices, but Vanessa and Ashley both have very nasal voices. That is a sign of an undeveloped voice. and in Ashley's case she is 21 she should know by now that she cant sing. It doesnt really matter that Zacs voice isnt his own. IT sounds like it is and that is all that matters."
5,The Best Disney Channel Movie Ever!!!,"I love High School Musical!I that that Troy & Gabriella sing great together.My favorite songs I like that they sing in the movie are:Get your head in the Game,Stick to what you nknow & Startin something new that Gabriella & Troy sing in movie.I didn't like the brother & sister very much is Sharpan & Ryan.I would love to get this movie on DVD!!!!"
5,the new grease,"kids love it......if you are going to buy it, amazon would be the place. they seem to have the lowest price and free shipping"
5,5 year old loves it!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She hasn't stopped watching it. She asks to watch it repeatedly and sits mesmerized throughout the whole show. I don't even mind watching it with her. It is well done.
4,Excellent entertainment for the whole family,"high School Musical is fun entertainment that you can enjoy with your kids day in and day out. It's a kid movie but I never get tired of watching these kids sing and dance. It's no Grease but for its purpose, it does a great job. My children watched it several times and already know all the songs and sing and dance to it all of the time. It's the greatest thing to watch, my kids that is, and the movie is fun to watch too."
1,Insipid Kid Vid,"This is my son's review.We had to watch this film on the van at my old school. It had ear-grading singing and an unimaginative score. The characters were cardboard. Every last one of them relates back to basal stereotypes. The jock. The vain popular girl. Her wimpy brother. The hot nerd. The disapproving coach. The over-dramatic drama teacher. All cardboard, all there.The songs could have been written by two year-olds. All these ""Disney Channel Original Movies"" are insipid, every one aimed at the 6-15 year old demographic, the only reliable audience left, since Disney has been demonized as pandering to small fry. Never has entertainment reached such lows. EVERY KID ON THAT VAN WAS ENTERTAINED. I knew different.""If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you""- Friedrich Nietzsche"
5,Excellent movie for the kids!,"""High School Musical"" is a great movie for kids (and for some parents who resist to grow up)."
5,Great,"This is a great family movie, my son and my niece really enjoy watching the movie. I really recommend this movie to familyies with children."
1,mistake,There was no DVD in case. Can't really review when I didn't get the DVD. I wanted the DVD so I wasn't happy at all.
5,Awesome!,"I loved this movie! It was excellent, and im going to pre-order it right NOW. Troy, Gabriella, and all their friends were wonderful characters. I wanted to watch this over and over again. My friend and I downloaded the dance steps, bought the sountrack, and are waiting for the movie!!!"
2,JUST PLAIN STUPID,"As part of a dare from my friend I sat down and watched this incredibly annoying movie and I enjoyed very little of what appears to cheaply made movie from the once-great Disney. Now there's hardly a Disney movie made nowadays that I enjoy without having the urge to punch myself in the nuts because of how lame they are. This film is only enjoyable for girls, not guys. I don't llike the teenage actors either, because they're pretty damn annoying(And the fact that a lot people I know are betting Zac Efron is gay). There is only one other movie I've watched that makes this film look a masterpiece, and that movie is Happy Feet: the worst movie of all time."
2,too much mush!,"I feel that disneychannel has taken the whole musical thing to extremes. I mean when 20th Century came out with 'The Sound of Music' they didn't have DVD'S, T-Shirts, or CD's and it's still considered a classic! Ortega did a great job choreographing/directing, but whoever the writer was didn't do a great job! The movie is terribly romantic and I don't understand why they couldn't get to the point! I mean the movie is called High School Musical, not Gabriella and Troy!"
3,Don't getcha head in the game,"What I think about High School Musical is, I didn't really like it. I like the music and stuff, but I didn't like how Troy and Gabriella come from a different world. I think it is mostly a girl movie."
4,Ew,its getting really annoying when freaky parents say things about their children in their reviews. It is soooooooooo very freaky.
5,"Very good, who cares about tonation","This movie is supposed to have morals, so why is everyone griping about Tone of sound? can you sing any better? Disney singers are young... do you remember when Britney, and christina were on it, their tapes are not so great. The songs were recorded before the nmovie was made, so they are lypsynching.This has great music for kids, and the songs are short and easy to remember for them. Let the kids enjoy it, it wasnt made for adults!Im sure the kids would hate GREASE and FAME as much as adults dont like this movie.. but you know what? ITS DISNEY, how can you hate Disney."
4,Very Good Movie,"This movie was a very good one. It's not screaming an Oscar Award, but considering that Disney made it, I'd say they did a more than okay job. I wasn't a huge fan of the dancing but the singing and acting was pretty good. Try this movie and see if it's for you. Some people love it, others hate it. It's all on how you look at it. A piece of advice, don't watch this movie if you are wanting to see an amazing film! This is just fun!"
1,Almost as bad as rotten clam chowder!!!,"Disney's laughing all the way to bank with this movie. The plot was so cheesy and predictable I was so bored that I almost did a puzzle while watching/falling asleep during this movie. For everyone who has not yet watched this yet but thinks this is going to be the next new hit I have a challenge. Start HSM at 9 o'clock pm and watch the ENTIRE movie without falling asleep, drifting off, or just getting bored of the movie. (I also might add that for you to complete this challenge you may not blast the volume up so as to not drift off) This plot was fishy from the very beginning. (Or as I should say, rotten clam chowder smelling)"
1,"What the @*%! do like, people like in this movie","I'm like, the biggest disney channel fan ever, and I hate this movie. During like, the third time whatching it, I fell asleep at like, 3:00 p.m. I just got all like, bored out of my mind when they started singing ""Bop to the Top"". The lyrics were like, totally crappy. Not to mention that Ashley Tisdale like, couldn't sing. I don't know how I like, fell asleep with her singing. Her voice was like, sooooooooo annoying. The plot was nothing like, new. Disney needs to hire new like, writers. While I was writing this like, review, I went from disney's number1 fan to like, hating them. Oh well. Hope you like, like my review."
1,High School Musical,"As I go through my holiday gifts now, I realize I didn't receive this video in the mail. What can I do?"
3,Great book but costs way too much,Other reviewers have actually said it all. This is a great book to learn the language. However a few things should be pointed out:1. The book is not all about Pointers as the title implies.(Most of the book is about other aspects of the C langauge)2. The price of this book cannot be justified.
5,Best Book on C Programming - Bar None!,"Better than Kernighan and Ritchie. Better than Harbison and Steele. Not for beginners to programming in general, but by far the best book for programmers looking to learn the C programming language. The emphasis on pointers is absolutely essential to serious C programming, and this is the only book I know of that is so oriented. You may study K&R or H&S, then go to look at some Linux kernel source and find yourself mystified. Not so with Reek's book. The former books teach pointers to be sure, but the level of detail and examples are insufficient for serious programming. The Reek book fills this void. An outstanding book and very readable as well. Buy it."
4,A very interesting abridgment of argentine tango,"Please, excuse me if I'm not writting in a perfect english... is not my native language! I'm not using spanish because I wish to make able to more people in the world my advice about this record. I think it's a good compilation of tango, very usefull for anybody who wants to begin to know this kind of music. You can find Carlos Gardel's classics and the fascinating compositions of Astor Piazzola too. There are instrumental works and others with singers cleverly choosed for each tango.Is one of my favorites as a gift to foreigners (I'm from Argentina) If you want to introduce yourself or a friend on this exotic and exciting music of my country... maybe you could try to begin with this record. I wish you enjoy it!"
4,Tango dilettante,"I really love this two CD set of tangos. This is emotional music- exuberant,often bittersweet, and ultimately triumphant.Be prepared for the dissonances of Piazzola.There is great variety of substance and style. All the works are performed by small ensembles or solo instruments, conveying the intimacy lacking in some orchestral versions. I have other recordings of tango but this is among the best with very good sound quality."
3,"Still Ann Rule, but not her best.","This book was a little too much Ann Rule for me. I have enjoyedmany of her books in the past, but she just couldn't seem toget a handle on this case, as compared to the other writers andjournalists who also wrote on the case. For whatever reason, Anncouldn't get past the he-said, she-said part of the investigations. But, all said and done, she remains my favorite.I would like to recommend a wonderful true crime novel I just finished, A Reason To Live: The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination To Survive. Now, these two guys havethe talent to take an ordinary true crime story and write itin such a way you wont' be able to put it down."
2,Slow to grab the reader!,"I am a true Ann Rule fan, having read everything she has written. This book however has left me almost to the point of scanning over the pages waiting to get past more information than is needed. I normally read a book in one or two days depending on how many pages and interruptions. This book though finds me sitting at page 200 and I have been reading it off and on for a week.Most readers of the book would have grasped the controlling nature and style of Tom Cappano way before now. It is a simple case of too much, too strung out information leading up to the actual important story line. It really doesn't take 200 plus pages for the reader to understand how this man manipulated and used women. Very boring thus far.There is no doubt in my mind it will improve when the actual story line comes into play."
4,Book often as whiny as Tom Capano,"I'm giving this 4 stars, but that's rather kind. My main complaint is that it's too long. As another reviewer has said, it starts out well, but becomes plodding a little more than midway through it. The background on the victim and her family - and even the murderer and his family, Tom and the Capanos - is pretty interesting, but after awhile, discussions about Tom Capano's escapades, games, narcissism, gets old and the actual discussion of the murder is somewhat anticlimactic. While you have some sympathy for Anne Marie (the murder victim), I felt none for Debby, Capano's almost twenty year extra marital affair. It is impossible for me to believe that Debby didn't see this guy for who and what he was - right up until he murdered another woman right under her nose - and still she didn't suspect anything. Sheesh! I was ready to throw HER overboard! A book worth reading, but certainly not the best TC I've read, not even the best Ann Rule."
4,Excellent book!,"Completely shocking cannot even to begin to describe this book. I had to do a report in my English 2 class and this book caught my eye and I'm sure glad it did. When I was introduced to Anne Marie Fahey and her family, I was concerned for her safety, although this being a book about murder, I already knew what was going to happen. Ann Rule writes very well and I commend her excellent effort put into this book."
5,"Ann Rule's very best in story development, description.","Having read all of Ann Rule's books, watched her development, can truly say this is her crowning achievement. She has mastered the descriptive art, the ability to place you, the reader, right in the center of the action. Could not put this book down once started: also became personally involved and empathetic with the victim and family. We loved Never Let Her Go!"
5,I loved the book,"I thought the book tells so much more then the news did. There were things that Ann Rule wrote that was very interesting . You can tell that she did her homework on this book. I could hardly put the book down , when i started to read it.I think that Ann Rule is so talented and shows that she really gets right into the life of who she is writing about. This book shows that ."
1,A complete waste of time,"I was anxiously anticipating this book and now I'm eagerly flushing it. A fascinating trial was turned to drivel and a thorough investigation turned to mush.As a woman I found this sophomoric, insulting and degrading.If you want to read a book about the Anne Marie Fahey case both ""The Summer Wind"" by George Anastasia and ""Above the Law"" by Brian Karem are far superior.Reading their books and then comparing them to this book made me think Ann Rule was covering a completely different trial. Then I read in the Wilmington News Journal that Ann Rule wasn't even IN the trial for the entire trial! Just a few days.Now it all makes sense. I was a great Ann Rule fan until this book...not any more."
3,Overdoing it,"This is a sad story and I feel horrible for the Fahey family, but Ann Rule totally overdoes it. Deborah McIntyre was NOT the victim. And Ms. Rule continuously goes on and on stating how beautiful she was when she so clearly is NOT (sorry I just have to say that). Tom Capano is a disgusting individual. Ann Rule gets so carried away trying to explain away Ms. McIntyre's mistakes and Ms. Fahey's mistakes that it takes away from the story. She didn't have to. To read about the case, Summer Wind is much better."
3,Mixed review,"I am a big fan of Ann Rule's and have read many of her books. She is well known for the incredible research she does and the amount of details she is able to provide about people's lives. Such is the case with this book but for some reason, I found some of the details to be excessive and I did some skimming early in the book. Once past some of what I found tedious to read, the book picked up and kept me turning pages and unable to put it down.The subject and the story of the book are fascinating and, in 2001, very timely. It will make you think a lot about current affairs that have an awful lot of similarities to this case. Rule's coverage of the trial is terrific and her presentation of the unraveling of the truth in this story are delivered with the suspense you'd expect from fiction. In this case, truth is, as in most of Rule's books, stranger than fiction."
1,This is a big ole goose egg of a book,"This wasn't very good and I wish I hadn't spent any money on it. I'm only writing this to warn off objective readers. I know Ms. Rule has legions of fans and they'll probably buy anything she writes. But the rest of us shouldn't be suckered in by the shallow ruminations redundantly deposited on the pages of this book. Buy Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" if you want real good true crime - don't accept any substitutes"
1,I think I found the missing boat anchor...it has about 400 pages,"Listen, I could have dealt with the endless threads of unnecessary information that seemed to loop back on themselves every twenty pages or so. I also could have overlooked the meandering flow of events that sometimes left me wondering if it was two days after the murder or six years before. But what finally got my goat was Ms. Rule's endless attempts to glamorize Anne Marie Fahey. Hardly a page in this ponderous book can be turned without some reference to Anne Marie's beauty. I even recall one description of a picture of Anne Marie describing her ""lovely eyes and soft lips."" OK..we get it...Anne Marie was hot and Tom Capano was a lecherous slob. Now can we please get on with the story?"
2,"Sorry, as of late, I'm very disappointed with Ann's books","What happened to the Ann Rule who wrote such good books as the Stranger Beside Me and Small Sacrifices? They were well researched and held my attention to the very end. From reading this book, I get the impression Ann attended a few days of the trial, purchased a transcript and found a few people to interview, then wrote her story. BORING, BORING, BORING. There are three other books written on this same case and are by far much better than Ann's. Sorry, but as of late, I have been very disappointed with Ann's last few books."
5,Deeply Nuanced Reporting,"I am a burned-out former paralegal from Wilmington, Delaware. I knew Thomas Capano and Anne Marie Fahey. I followed the trial closely, and I have read all four true crime books based on this case. Even though Ms. Rule is not a local reporter, her understanding of Wilmington's unique political and social climate is much deeper and more nuanced than any of the other authors'. I strongly recommend this book, which is both a clear-eyed study of this case and a real pleasure to read -- fast-moving and yet deeply felt."
1,Biased and Long Book,This is the first Ann Rule book I have ever read. I plan To make it the last.The book was very biased. It could not really be called investigative. It seemed to present a one dimensional side of the events. It is amazing that it took so many pages to present such a limted view. I do not know the facts of the situation but it really seems like the author used a lot of words to not tell a complete story.
3,Much Too Tedious,"Rule does a decent job of piecing together a three-year saga that she didn't start covering until after Capano was sentenced to death. Unfortunately, to compensate for her absence, she numbs readers with meaningless details. Another sore point: She tries to create a sympathetic character out of Capano mistress Debby MacIntyre, who bought the murder weapon and played (?) dumb for two years. The guess here is that the sympathetic portrayal is the author's payback for Debby's cooperation with the book. For truer accounts, try either Fatal Embrace or The Summer Wind. Both books were written by excellent investigative reporters who covered the case."
1,chilling insight into an obsessive man and an insecure woman,This is Anne Rule's finest book. She successfully explains the reasons Capano was able to find each woman's vulnerabilities and exploit them. Reading about the trial makes you feel you were right in the courtroom and the jury reached the correct verdict for such a cold blooded monster.
5,I Couldn't Put It Down !,"Ann Rule is an excellent writer, no one could out-do her book about this case. She brings people in the book to life and includes a lot of detail. Very well-written. It will remain one of my favorites among Ann's books. Ann is able to write with feeling,emotion,clarity, and common sense....it is very human writing..... is why it's so wonderful to read her writing. She is a great reporter."
5,A Possessive Man,"I thought this book was outstanding for the kind or reporting and research. Ann Rule is the master, since she has had a lot of practice and personal experience. I have met a couple of the Capano brothers, so had a personal interest in this book. It is amazing to me how a man can feel like he ""owns"" a woman forever after he has had an affair with her. I think Thomas Capano was obsessed with Ann Marie Fahey, and when she rejected him, he was enraged. If anyone left anyone, he wanted to be the one doing the leaving. This murder was planned and calculated by him, and he made the mistake of thinking he could outsmart everyone because he was a lawyer. It is a shame because the world lost an apparently a really nice lady who never harmed anyone except to break up with Thomas Capano."
5,Fascinating Story,"A few days ago, I finally finished ..And Never Let Her Go, and all I can say is -- WOW! What a book! I've read several of Ann's books and this one, along with In the Name of Love , is my favorite. You've GOT to read this one!"
3,And Never Let Her Go,"I read alot of true crime and I am a fan of Ann Rule. Here she tells the story of a young woman who lost her mother while she was just alittle girl, who lived with an alcoholic father and had little money growing up. Anne Marie Fahey turned her sorrow into a productive and happy life filled with family and friends. She made one mistake though, she got involved with Thomas Capano. While the book gets a bit tedious at times, it is still interesting. One wonders how Deborah McIntyre could have been so dumb that she didn't realize Capano had other mistresses. Was she as innocent as she claims?"
5,A TRULY GREAT BOOK...UNABLE TO PUT IT DOWN FOR VERY LONG,"I FOLLOWED THIS CASE FROM DAY 1 AND THIS BOOK WENT SO MUCH DEEPER THAN THE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT WE WERE ALL INUNDATED WITH. I WAS LIVING IN THE AREA AT THE TIME AND SINCE MOVED TO FLORIDA, AND THIS BOOK MADE THE STORY COMPLETE FOR ME. ANN WAS ABLE TO GIVE TRUE LIFE TO ANN MARIE AND MADE HER READERS FEEL AS IF WE KNEW HER. I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK ESPECIALLY TO ANYONE LIVING IN THE DELAWARE,PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY AREA."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book would make a great sleeping pill. It is overwritten and incredibly tedious.Making Deborah MacIntyre into such a sympathetic character is extremely hard to swallow for those of us who know this case in the Delaware area. It's angering and insulting to see this woman presented so sympathetically after she purchased the gun that killed Anne Marie Fahey and concealed her affair with Tom Capano for so many years from Tom's wife who was Debby's friend!Ponderous, tedious and extremely pointless. This book starts off like a lead laiden Zepplin and explodes into, mind numbing thud."
1,"Disappointing, Somnambulent",Not Ann Rule's Best. She stretches here to find sympathy for some characters that don't deserve it and her courtroom descriptions seem oddly out of synch.It is mind numbing and vapid and seems to have been written in a hurry.I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
3,Pretty typical mid-'70s chopsocky,"But still fun, if you're in the mood or are a fan of the genre.Basically, the background story is about rival gangs in (then-)contemporary Hong Kong (I think? I could be wrong), fighting over turf, while the main character is trying to track down a rare piece of yellow jade (I did not know that there was such a thing - well, live and learn) that his father allegedly stole and did time for.Highlights include some 'comical' fighting (including some REALLY poorly timed fake punches); super-crummy dubbing (so bad it's funny); a pretty cool climactic bus chase that ends in a great ball o' fire; and a supporting actress who doffs her top early on to reveal an astonishing rack (that's pretty clearly not fake)."
3,Fairly Good Action Flick,"Based loosely on a real incident, the Wind and the Lion is a well done action flick with some problems. Though Steve Kanaly is a very good Marine Captain and Brian Keith (the Wind) makes a pretty good Roosevelt, Connery (the Lion) is totally miscast as Rasuli, the kidnapper. Omar Sharif, or some more believable actor would have been better. Candace Bergin was good, but her relationship with Rasuli is too ""updated."" What Muslim strongman would listen to any woman repeatedly belittle and challenge him a century ago? Nonetheless, despite the casting and some modern dialogue and relationship issues, it has enough action and good pacing to be a darn good movie overall. Entertaining!"
5,Great Movie,I bought this for my husband and I ended up watching it too. It's a great movie and the actors do a good job.
2,not recommended,I was impressed by the setting and actually watched the whole thing. Too much killing. And the story line kind of boring. It's just an ok movie - I wouldn't recommend it.
1,disappointing,I thought with Sean Connery in the lead this would be a winner but my wife fell asleep after 10 minutes and I kept waiting for it to get better... Not with it even at a discount.
2,Worst of the genre,"I love the genre, and tend to be forgiving due, unhappily, to the few movies of this type made. Laurence of A, Khartoum, Charge of the Light Brigade, Man Who Would be King, Zulu, Zulu Dawn, 55 Days at Peking, Conduct Unbecoming. Couple that with Connery, who, like M.Cain, I enjoy watching even in the odd bad movie. This movie should, therefore, be among my favorites. It isn't. In fact, I tossed it after I watched it. I found it boring, and frankly I don't really know why."
5,What a Sneaky Way to Teach History,"The movie is actually about Teddy Roosevelt and his interventionist policies regarding world affairs. The apparent story line is about an American widow (Bergen) and her young son who are ""kidnapped"" by a Bedouin warrior (""The Razouli"") played by Sean Connery -- who is at his most charming. The sub-plot is about the hierarchical machinations of Bedouin tribes in desert society. Briefly, the Razouli's nephew is a rival chief who has stolen the honor of the Razouli. In turn, the Razoul holds the Americans as his guests until his honor has been restored. Teddy Roosevelt has no patience for any Middle Eastern tribal squabbles that he does not understand and so he sends in troops to rescue the charming widow and America wields its big stick in another hemisphere."
1,AN ABSOLUTE FARCE,The acting (and I mean all the actors except for John Huston's small part)and the script are really bad. I was expecting a great action adventure but found myself constantly laughing at just how poorly done this movie was. I wish there was a new category called Farce. Then I'd give it five stars.
1,Never received it!,"They sent me the Wizard of Oz instead, which is not what I ordered! The movie itself I have seen before and is awesome, though!"
2,Hollywood Re-writes History (Again),"This foray into historical fiction is mostly fiction and very little history. What did the movie get right?:1. Perdicaris's were captured and held hostage by2. Mohammed el RaisuliWhat did it get wrong?:1. Father & son Perdicaris were captured not mother and children (in fact Mother Perdicaris telephoned for help).2. The event lasted 5 weeks not the months portrayed.3. Not a shot was fired, in fact, Marines were specifically barred from using force.4. The Perdicaris's were returned largely unharmedSOURCE: ""Theodore Rex"" by Edmund MorrisIt gets 2 stars only because Sean Connery is so laughably bad as an Arab (he shtill hash his sshlurring dialect) and worth the view--at least for awhile. Again Hollywood shows its knack for fiction when it deems history poor box office."
4,Classic!,"A great classic movie in a superb picture quality for a standard DVD. Sound lacks a little bit, but ..."
5,a very good epic,The Wind and the Lion is a delightful epic about the turn of the 20th century and competing colonial powers. The cast is absolutely perfect for this genre.
5,Why isn't this movie on DVD?,"On of Connery's best and the only one not offered on DVD. It's to bad because the story's every bit as good as ""55 Days At Peking"", and the action and acting is much better!"
5,The Scotish Sultan,"One of the greatest and most underappreciated movies of all time. There is nothing you can say about this film that can be explained in words. I recommend that every man, woman and child rent this movie, turn off every light in the house, and play it as loud as humanly possible. They don't make movies like they used to and this epic adventure is a true gem. Even if the lead charecter is an Arab man with a slight scottish accent. lol"
5,A MUST HAVE!,I watched this film long ago and saw it recently on cable in silence with popcorn on my big screen. My thought was an impressive adventure film I must have on DVD! (still waiting). Sean Connery pulls off being an arab despite his accent rather well. Candice is the timeless beauty that draws the support of the USMC in early 1900's. Brian Keith plays president Teddy Roosevelt very well. I was charmed with the boy in the film who turns Connery into his hero knowing what a man with honor is suppose to be even if he is a kidnaper for his cause in other eyes. The U.S. Marines show just what they are made of admirably. There is so much in this film you would waste your life of watching movies if you pass on this one. Our current times show just how timeless this movie really is. A MUST HAVE!
2,"A Long-Winded ""Lion""","It's easy to see why ""The Wind and the Lion"" (1975) was overshadowed by the far-superior ""The Man Who Would Be King."" Writer-director John Milius' ambitious romantic adventure is curiously uninvolving - marked by a painful lack of chemistry between Sean Connery and Candice Bergen (roles originally intended for Omar Sharif and Julie Christie). Among the film's few virtues are Brian Keith's brilliant Theodore Roosevelt and Jerry Goldsmith's memorable Oscar-nominated score. A major disappointment considering the vast amount of talent."
5,Absolutely NECESSARY Sex Scenes! Yea!,"It's very rare that I find sex scenes necessary to the telling of a story, but in this book it just had to be. Perfect.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did feel the love develope between these two tortured souls. It was a story that haunts me even though I'm now reading another one of her books.I could not put ""Second Hand Wife"" down even though I wanted to go to bed. That says a lot for a person who devides her books into two readings: first half one night, second half the next night.I have read several of Ms. St.John's books, and I think her writing style is similar to Laveryl Spencer's. That is great because I adored Spencer's work, and now that she's retired, I have found someone to replace her. Well, almost. She was in a league of her own when writing heart tugging stories, but Ms St.John is pushing her way to the top.Bravo! Keep up the good work."
1,A V ERY POOR EXCUSE FOR A KOSHER MEAL,i OBSERVE KOSHER LAWS AND SINCE I TRAVEL A LOT I HOPED LABRIUTE WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO MANY FRUSTRATING SEARCHES FOR A KOSHER MEAL. I BOUGHT THIS TURKEY MEAL AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE PACKAGING AND PREP ARE CLEVER AND EASY TO DO - THE BOX WAS HEATED IN 15 MINUTES. THE PROBLEM WAS WHAT WAS INSIDE THE BOX! IT WAS TERRIBLE - MOSTLY DRY SORT OF MASHED POTATOES AND A FEW SLICES OF PROCESSED TURKEY (I THINK IT WAS TURKEY BECAUSE THE BOX SAID SO- IT TASTED LIKE PAPER). WELL AT LEAST I KNOW WHAT NOT TO BUY IN THE FUTURE.
4,Good value and useful when power is out.,The turkey tastes good and the potatoes are ok. Leave the product in the cooking bag for the maximum time as the first one I ate was luke warm. This is not a gourmet meal but much better than a can of tuna in a power outage.
5,More than just Asanas!,This is an excellent guide to the Hatha Yoga way of life in all its aspects of health and well-being. You don't have to practice yoga positions to benefit from the wisdom and practical suggestions of this book. Just something as small as breathing correctly can change your whole physiology. I found this book to be very helpful in my overall goal to making a temple of my body as a way to aid my spiritual growth.
1,Healthy bits of metal in your tea?,"35 days after we started using this kettle we noticed that the bottom metallic coating (paint, lacquer, metal, who knows?) was coming off in little chips and we had been drinking this for who knows how long.This was not some packing gunk but a surface that was (supposed to be) permanent. We had not treated the pot roughly, only read instructions, washed it lightly, rinsed it with water & a cup of vinegar when we first got it, and nothing after that. We use filtered water.Also, on the outside of the kettle, the handle had not been attached properly so that a corner of a washer stuck out a bit, keeping one of the screws from going in all the way. This did not affect performance so we had let it slide as obtaining a working teapot has been very difficult. Apparently designing a utensil to heat water on a stove is beyond the capabilities of our wonderful global economy."
3,Review of the actual album...not the TV character,"Ignore all the fake one and five star reviews. I would have been tempted to praise the CD as a joke or blast it because some prettyboy Hollywood actor dared to a rap album....but I actually listened to it.All preconceptions aside, the CD's actually on the good side of average. Brian Green isn't great on the mic, but unlike most of the rappers out today, he actually has a flow and put some effort into the album. The lyrics are dated and corny at times (he probably had A LOT of help with his best verses), but the production is the high point. Most of the album is produced by Slim Kid Tre, with LA Jay and the Black Eyed Peas doing a few tracks.I know 75% of you are just going to dismiss it as straight garbage, but I suggest that anyone who was feeling the Pharcyde and similar artists around the mid-90s check it out. There are 4 or 5 solid tracks that make it worth picking up out of the bargan bin."
3,Decent Hip-hop debut,I thought Brian A. Green did a decent job with his flow and I'm not the biggest hip-hop fan. The production was very smooth and usually you don't hear or see a white guy rapping over jazz/soul type beats. I know he is an actor and all but I think if you can get past that you'll see that he's actually has a decent flow and this has a nice smooth 90s hip-hop vibe instead of the hardcore gangsta or angry rap from other artists. It would have been nice to see him come out with a follow up to this album.
1,Old People?,"The term ""old people"" is offensive to me, and this book is full of the term. The authors cite themselves so frequently that the validity of the content is questionable."
1,Horrid,"Pray that you do not have a class that requires this book. Most of the articles in this compilation are poor examples of what a health care professional should know. Since this is a compilation of articles, half the terms used have no straight forward definitions, and of course there is no glossary. You will find yourself constantly referencing previous works by the various authors to try to make sense of anything. Beware!!"
3,Good lyrics but.....,"Sean Combs/P. Diddy/Puffy/Puff Daddy/Diddy (Stick to one name; it's getting annoying) sounds like he is trying to sing on this song. He is not Queen Latifah or Pharrell Williams. He will not have a successful music career trying to do both inging and rapping like Pharell and Queen Latifah do. Anyways, the song would have been better if Diddy's parts were rapped, not sung. His voice sounds annoying in this song. The song shows off some of Keyshia Cole's best vocal work. That is the only reason why this get 3 stars. I Also don't see why this was added to Keyshia'sJust Like Youalbum."
3,hate diddy but keyshia cole saves the day,song gets 3 stars only becauase of keyshia otherwise it would suck I just hate diddy.
3,good enough for an introduction,"Sim does a good job of introducing Lyotard and focuses on a wide range of his books. He admits that he contradicts Lyotard's anti unification tendencies in writing a book that unifies much of Lyotard's thought, but at times this becomes annoying since he repeatedly ties all of Lyotard's thought back to his experiences as a young Marxist. This book is a good start, but I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing Lyotard on the basis of this book alone."
1,Exactly the same as the Home Depot boxes,"At $100 for three, I was expecting more from these. Perhaps bigger, heavier, sturdier, more robust? Nope! I have a number of Home Depot storage crates (at a fraction of the cost of these) and the Home Depot boxes are better! Stay away from Akro-Mils. I'm very disappointed."
4,First true box-making compendium.,"This book is the first true compendium of box makers working in wood, with a total of four hundred pieces displayed in full color. The photos were submitted by the caftspeople themselves, and most of the photos and the work as well, are of professional quality. Many of the best pieces are actually by amateurs, which is not surprising given the labor-intensiveness of a quality wood box. The book is refreshingly themeless, and the work runs from classical to whimsical, with a decided tendency towards unconventional design. Only the bare minimum of information beyond the photos --size, material, a few artists comments, and in back, contact information. This is a great resource for the professional or aspiring woodworker, or even for an amateur looking for a full beadth of inspiration,or for the collector or decorator looking for a veritable encyclopedia of wood boxes."
5,I Used It For My Term Paper,"I'm taking a class in cross cultural studies and we were asked to do a paper on the history of racism. I bought this DVD as a tool to help me with my report and I am happy I did. The films of Martin Luther King are a wealth of information. Even better was the way it shows you how Germans duing World War II made racism a part of their culture, leading to the great war. It made me think differently about the racism I encounter in my daily life and provided me with a good perspective and quotes for my paper. Five stars!"
1,Bitter Harvest Review,Bitter Harvest is about a man who gets accused of something he did out of self-defense. He goes though racism and torture. This man murdered three men out of self-defense. This book was all about how people are so prejudice that they cannot even look passed their feelings about others. Bitter Harvest was based on a true story.I enjoyed this book because it was a true story about the passed. About racism and how people hated each other. This is something that I really find interesting to read about. How people lived in America in the 60's or 70's. Bitter Harvest had tons of exciting adventures put in to the story. This is what people thought when they were apart of this story.He reason I chose this story is because it is about crime. It is also about trust and truth. Also I loved the cover. I thought it would be interesting. It was believed that it would be about World War 2. Even though it wasn't it was still okay. Anyways all of these events are true with plenty of depth.
4,What Can I Say?,"What can I say? It's a car charger. It just works. The blue cap glows when it's plugged in, which is kind of cool. I am using it with a Motorola E810 phone."
5,Motorola Car Charger.,"Faster than the charger that comes with the cellphone. I have the Motorola E815 and without to much talking, here there are the pros and cons of the product.Pros:- The phone got fully charge, and i mean, until the outside little battery icon stoped flashing, in only 35 minutes, even faster than the standard charger the phone brought.- I also charged my Motorola HS820 headset in only 20 minutes.- Nice blue light that shows you when the charger is connect it to the source.- It brings a gadget that let you attached the cord of the charger without getting out, letting you store it comfortably in your car.Cons:- The Cord, besides it is very resisting, it's very short, Making you put the phone sometimes in places you don't want.It is a great charger from Motorola, and you get more than you expect, more than all, in charging time."
1,Order has been in since November 2002,Actually 0 stars but there was no 0 for the rating.Place your order somewhere else. I have had nothing but updates for back order for this product. Now I will have to buy them somewhere else and spend about 20.00 more.
4,"Simple, useful, it's just a cord","I wish the car accessory world would move away from these clunky cigarette lighter electronics. It's like using an 8-track tape player adapter long after all the 8-tracks no longer play ;-)Actually, I appreciate that this adapter can plug in while the phone is still in it's belt clip. Why? Not because I plug it in while the clip is on my belt, but because it's such a pain to get the phone out of the clip! (see other review)."
2,stopped working after 4 months,This product stopped working after 4 months. It connects just fine but won't charge the phone.
3,Good but clumsy,"It is good but unfortunately not as good as chargers for Nokia. After moving from Nokia to Motorola, I found that it takes considerable effort to fix the charger to the phone while driving unlike Nokia, which could instead be connected in a jiffy."
3,Not Reliable,"The problem I keep having with 3-party phone accessories is that they are generally not reliable. So I bought this one because of it's Motorola brand, and guess what! Only 2 weeks into using the product it's causing problems like not charging or being loose.I wish people would come out with better / more reliable products!"
1,Entirely Disposable - - Buyer Beware,"As cheaply made as a Chinese toy, I blew through three of these in a period of 6 months. The wires pull away from both the charging port contact and cigarette lighter port contact with such ease the manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves.In fact, Amazon really should pull this one from the site, and I've suggested they look into the product. But I guess if you're reading this, it's escaped untouched.3 times burned... but never again,Mk"
4,durable,"This torpedo level is much heavier than the alternatives. I expect it to hold up to many years of use and abuse. Only 4 stars because of the value. Although it is more heavy duty than the competition, you pay for it."
3,Looks and feels great but......,"I've owned this level, and also the Bostich version of this... The center bubble has gone outta wack on both levels... Not by alot, but still not good if you need absolute accuracy. Being an Electrician by trade,, I like to run my work as level as can be.... Still, not the worst level in the world because I do like the rotating vial for making offsets and such..... I'm going to return this one for a new one at the big box store I bought it from..."
2,Works Loudly,"This air pump works but it pretty regularly starts making a very loud noise as if it is revving up an unseen engine before the green flag comes down. Unfortunately, it won't stop making this noise until you pick it up, look it over for some hint about why the air pump sounds like an experimental music festival, and then put it back down. Even if you put it in the exact same spot, the Rena Air 200 seems satisfied because it will return to the quiet hum...for a half-hour or so.I gave it to Goodwill who will hopefully help it find use some place out of ear shot."
2,"Nipple broke off, pump is useless now",I've had this product for about 2 years now and it's worked fine. Very quite and and I like rena products. I have 3 of their xp filter setups and have been very happy with them. I needed to re-arrange some things with my tanks and the nipple the hose goes on broke off when I tried to remove the hose from the pump. Now the pump is useless.
2,Rena Air Pumps Model 200,Not what is represented or I have a bad one. I don't know which. Should have returned this one but didn't.
2,good gods please stop w/the jazz backup!,"This album, pardon the visual, but it's like someone hawking a great big loogie in the middle of your favorite you've-been-pining-for-it-all-day dessert. The dessert is delicious, but who would want to eat it?Eivor is brilliant. Her voice. The drums. It's tribal. It's primal...and then come the jazzy bits. I cringe at the clashing wheedling trumpets and that god awful jazz drum. It makes my skin crawl.Who thought THIS was a good combo of genres?I WANT to love this album! Her music is too phenomenal not to love! Watch her live on youtube to see what I mean.But the jazz...but the jazz.I can't listen to it.What a waste."
3,I purchased another case instead...,after receiving this one the window did not line up correctly. I ...found a really nice Krusell deluxe leather case with multidapt that let me choose up to 12 optional accessories. I went with the deluxe swivel clip and I have to tell you this is the best case I have ever seen for the V60...`
1,Don't waste your time/money...,"When I got this item, I was so sure it would protect my phone. Two days after I got it, the phone caught on my steering wheel and was pulled sideways, and the clip broke. I replaced it, but the new clip never quite fit right and it was always falling out. The top half of the case does not fit when the phone is open and it falls off every time you answer, AND the top half only fits over about an inch of the top of the phone. I wanted a cover to protect the phone from the oils in your skin when you talk. Only the bottom half is protected from this. Lastly, after six months of use, the ""knob"" that goes into the clip had stretched out the leather so much that the phone fell forward instead of hanging straight and I knew it would completely rip any day. I found a Neoprene elasticized ""pouch"" that my phone now calls home. No protection while in use, granted, but nice and snugly held when not in use."
2,"Worked very well when new, but didn't last long.","I've had this case since the day I bought the phone six months ago. It worked great when it was new. It does make the phone a little bulky, and I actually like the belt clip with the spring loaded button. It protects the phone very, very well. Nary a scratch in six months.The biggest problem I've had is getting the piece that fits over the top half of the phone to stay on. It seems that the leather/plastic combination has streched out over time to the point where it will not stay on the top part. I had to stop using it. I could turn it in to AT&T and get a new one, but I'm just going to have the same problem in a month or two. Right now I'm using the original plastic holster, which seems to work fairly well but provides zero protection.The aftermarket needs to jump on this problem!! Where is Body Glove when you need them?"
2,Very poor OEM case,Purchased the V60t and ordered the case because Amazon.com did not have anything else(i.e.Body Glove). Motorola put very little thought into this case for such a great phone. Offers some protection but not for the front Caller I.D. screen area. The belt clip drops the rating on this case. Nothing beats the swivel clip for easy removal and the design ruins the look of the phone. Did find a cellular dealer here ...that had both Body Glove and sb wireless ...cases that are much better and more attractive. If you cannot find any other case to protect your phone this will do but be prepared for a fight with the belt clip when you get a call.
1,Badly designed,"While I like the fact that this case allows me to see the external display on my V60, the rest of the desig is almost as bad as the clip that originally came with the phone.The clip on the case is the same as the standard motorola pager clip, therefore making it difficult to get it on and off of your belt to answer a call or see who is calling. The clip is also so thick that the case itself is thicker than the original phone even without the phone in the case! It also will not fit in the desktop charger with the case on the phone and due to the design on the case you have to completely remove it to make it fit.I have actually reverted to using the horrible original clip as I didn't like this big bulky thing on my hip. Here's hoping BodyGlove comes out with a V60 case soon....."
1,Two thumbs DOWN...,"This is a very poorly designed case. The phone it is ""specifically designed for"" does not even fit into it. I regret buying it, and I should have listened to the many reviews by people who got suckered into buying this case before me. The ""leather"" is probably the absolute lowest grade availabe...but what do you expect. Bottom line: Save your money for something else... I think I'll try a Body Glove case."
2,Better on Optimism than on Pessimism,"Dr. Seligman has become well known for his work on optimism (i.e., Learned Optimism). But this edited collection of essays and his Positive Psychology movement in general, do not show a very sophisticated understanding of psychological research and theory on pessimism. This edited volume can be compared directly with: Optimism & Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice, Edited by Edward C. Chang. I find Chang's book to be more scholarly, better balanced, and thus more informative. Unrealistic optimism is no adequate replacement for the authenticity of anxiety and worry or the adaptive value of constructive pessimism."
1,Not at all funny. Waste of $$$,We loved the Doc Martin series and thought we would give this a try. It is not funny and has an annoying laugh track. I wish we had not made the purchase.
2,Highly disappointing.,"I guess that I expected too much, after enjoying Clunes' Doc Martin immensely. Reggie is BARELY funny at best, and Clunes carries the entire load. Plots are weak and predictable, and the series' writers need to go back to school. Save your money, and wait for Doc Martin 5."
1,Don't buy anything off this website!,"Amazon failed to deliver the product, I was told it was destroyed in transit. I was issued a refund for less than I paid, and told I would have to replace my order if I wanted to still receive the item.Further more I had purchased the promoted canopy protection plan for a related item, and was told Amazon could not refund my warrantyDon't buy anything off this website!"
2,Ruined by laugh track,I labored to get through the first episode and doubt that I will move on to the second. The problem - and I am surprised it is not noted in other reviews - is a laugh track that would be considered intrusive even by American sitcom standards.
3,"good, but not great -- dark drums volumes are better","I received the UK version of this back in June. The second disc is the gem here - nice filthy, tribal tunes with a lot of funk along with some odd electro tracks thrown in. Both discs are mixed well, but the first disc just doesn't seem to capture my interest as much. I recommend picking up his Dark Drums volumes instead which are both incredible."
3,Sort of disappointed....,"Disc 1 is vintage Lawler: smooth, steady tribal beats with sexy voice-overs, pulsating basslines, and no breaks in the mix for catching your breath. It picks up right where his Dark Drums volumes left off. But Disc 2 is a trip in a different direction from what you'd expect from this master of tribal house. Not nearly as sinister or sexy, but more mechanical and techno-ey. And that is what disappoints me about this set. This set is supposed to be all about the sleazier side of clubbing, with sweaty dancefloors, flashing lights and freaky dancing. Disc 1 accomplishes this, but not Disc 2. Oh well, disc 1 still rocks and 1 out of 2 ain't bad I guess."
4,Lights Out Inaugural Edition Another GU Masterpiece,"Overall, the Global Underground establishment has another hit on its hands Ñ as are all their publications. A few cuts are less than thrilling. But overall it's great. I rate 24 of the 28 tracks 4 or 5 stars. Only the last track rates 2 stars and that's just because I find the vocal conclusion boring.Overall this is a great pair of discs. I am a loyal buyer and longtime listener of everything Global Underground produces. I really think they are one team of ears you can trust to deliver the goods each and every time they release a pair of CDs. I would never tell you not to buy anything they help create.These guys are the best producers of techno compilations in the world Ñ bar none. If you see it's a Global Underground Audio Publication, don't bother to read the reviews. Just buy it. You will never be disappointed.Next up is GU023 Barcelona.James Lavelle on October 15. Pre-Order NOW! It's guaranteed to be another Global Underground hit!"
5,deep adventure,"This CD is great, takes you on an adventure trip deep in the progressive house woods. A couple of songs are a bit cheesy and commercial but most of it is v good specially the second half of CD 2 beautilful and great mixing. Recommended for connaisseurs."
5,Product Excellence!,I knew what I was getting when I purchased these cables. The name alone said it all for me. I bought these to rid the buzzing and static interference that was traveling throughout my speakers with the old set that I had. These puppies certainly did the job and now my system sounds a lot better. Thank you
3,"Monster Quality, Monster Size","These cable come with everything we love about Monster cables. They're not the super extreme cables lined with miles of gold, but are over-kill for our household and car audio needs. They come with the screw-on plugs, so if something goes wrong, you could fix it. Unfortunately, it also comes with one of the characteristics we all hate about Monster cables. They are fat and bulky. The MPC-I304 is meant to be installed in the tight space behind a head unit in the dashboard. The molded plastic Y housing defeats the whole purpose of having the stubby RCA jacks by eating away valuable real-estate. It's hard to pull through the nooks and crannies in the car, albeit less prone to tearing. If you're installing a large head unit like a GPS navi, opt for thinner more maneuverable cables. If you must go with Monster, the i404 and i204 series don't come with the bulky molded Y housing. Why Monster, why!?"
5,Catherine Cookson,I LOVE all Catherine Cookson books !!! I hope to read all her novels and I re-read many of them.Miss Cookson stories are the cleanest and most enjoyable available but yet they are never boring.
5,I Wanna Iguana,"This book is funny and original. What I particularly liked about it is that it doesn't simplify its vocabulary as so many children's books do. It can bear many readings, as little details in the notes back and forth become more apparent. It won't teach much about iguanas per se, but is entertaining and visually appealing."
5,Great paired with I Wanna New Room by the same author...,Nice example of persuasive writing that students really enjoyed reading...both of Orloff's I Wanna books are checked out frequently in our library.
5,the rabbit died,I love this book and have used it with many classes I have taught. It is a belly full of laughs and a great real life learning tool. WHen I found it on line I had to purchase a copy to give to a dear friend who needed cheering up. It worked.
4,Tough workout!,"This is one of the old Firm tapes made from clips of older Firm workouts. This is the workout that introduced me to the ""Firm"" and it is tough! That being said if you stick with this workout you will see results in 10 workouts or less as stated on the box. The older Firm tapes are pretty good. If you are very overweight or outta shape YOU MAY NOT WANT TO START HERE."
1,Not Worth My Time,"I was very disappointed in this book. I received it for free from my insurance company when I became pregnant with my second child. I found most of the tips to be a bit silly. I had to stop reading when the author recommended using a plastic grocery bag as a bib! I was shocked. If your looking for a good book on baby care, this is not it! I would recommend Baby 411 instead."
3,Rather predictable,"I read this book after reading the WWJ's Ashes series and have to say that ""The Survivor"" main character is the pick of the crop. He is a doctor, a weapons specialist, a pilot, a survivalist, married, two kids, got himself a retreat in the mountains with everything planned and ready. In the book, everything works out for him; he kills drug smugglers, saves woman from heart attack with an electrical cord, lands the plane, has a cache of weapons on the plane, kills a 40 member gang of evil moorcyclists almost by himself, finds everything he needs right away, gets the perfect car, the best motorcycle, the best weapons, .... he is just one lucky survivalist. Whatever happened to everyday working Joe who is gotta learn everything from scratch?"
4,Well worth the read,"I read this book when it came out many years ago and was pleased by the content. At the time I was in the military and a firearms dealer. It was a pleasure to see a writer who knew his subject. Mr. Ahern knew his firearms. But like any book of this type the hero never dies and will save the world. In a way it was like reading a James Bond or ""The Executioner"" book with a dooms day twist. Fun, light, and fast reading. The first 10 books are the best of the series."
4,An excellent book for the time it was written.,"I began reading the series while on active duty with the USN. The mood of the country, especially the military at that time is reflected in the first 10 books. I thought the descriptions of the firearms were a bit heavy, but the author is obviously a gun collector and loves guns. The story line is outstanding for an 80's book. The USSR was our potential enemy and the possibility of a attack was very real. This is not a book for someone looking to be intellectually challenged, but it is entertaining. One must recognize this type of book is like a James Bond movie; it must be taken in it's intended context. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting some good 80's escapism."
4,A fantastic start to a brilliant series,A fantastic book which starts the series off with a bang.A must rea
5,Excellent Series,"I read the whole series years ago, and remember not being able to wait until the next installments came out! I even named on of my 6 children after the Russian ex-KGB agent of John Thomas Rourke, sidekick, etc. Natalia Anastasia. My whole family has read the series over the years. I'd highly recommend them. They are probably showing their age a bit, but this kind of writing usually holds up well. They are the kind of books that one can read very quickly, and doesn't want to put down after starting. I remember many times reading them cover to cover, in just a setting, staying up all night, etc. HIGHLY Recommended, as well as most of Jerry Ahern's stuff!"
2,Where is the party?,This is not a film for kids. It is an amateurish-looking documentary with encyclopedic information on puppies. My son who is crazy for puppies sat only half way through it...Puppies are very cute though.
2,"well produced, but it's more for people versus dogs.","I liked the puppies, they are all very cuddly. But if you are looking for a dvd that men's best friends would be interested in, this is not the one."
2,DISCO SWEAT,I BOUGHT THIS EXERCISE TAPE BECAUSE I LIKE DISCO MUSIC. I FOUND THE MOVES HARD TO FOLLOW DUE TO LACK REPITIOUS INSTRUCTION OF RICHARD SIMMONS. HE WOULD JUST GO INTO THE MOVES WITHOUT MUCH PRACTICE. I HAVE TRIED IT THREEE TIMES AND I FEEL IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY. I DIDN'T BUY IT TO LEARN DANCE.
4,Just Do The Best You Can.....,"Okay, so the introductory videos like ""Sweating to the Oldies"" aren't cutting it for you anymore. You aren't sweating enough. You need to move on up to a dvd or VCR tape like Disco Sweat. Are the moves easy? No. Will it take awhile to catch on? Of course. But you still can move along with the catchy music as you learn more complex steps. You will sweat. You will get conditioned. I have been working out since April and lost nearly 20 lbs. so far. I think the key is to vary your exercise, so try this tape a few days a week. The other days try something else (I suggested something by Gilard). I agree that Disco Sweat is a bit silly at times but it is worth the money. Good luck! As Richard says ""Just Do the Best You Can..."""
5,"""Disco Sweat"" your fat off!","hey everyone!let me tell you that richard simmons' ""disco sweat"" is the best one you can get for a heavier, yet low-impact workout! i have participated in most of his workouts and i recommend this one first! so, get up and get your blood flowing, 'cause he's got some great music and attitude directed right atcha! it's fun and you lose weight doing it! so, what's your excuse now...?!--jennifer bowers"
2,There are better Richard tapes out there,"I did not like this tape. First, I found the production quality to be inferior to other Richard tapes that I own. The dancers whooping and hollering overshadowed the music. That was particularly off putting to me. The moves were more difficult to follow than in other Richard tapes. I would suggest Richard's ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" series rather than this tape."
4,Aerobicize And Shed Your Excess Pounds,"If you love exercising while listening to disco music, this is a must have DVD. Richard Simmons is a very motivating and charismatic figure that can influence overweight women to cry away their depression into radiant happiness and self-confidence. Go figure. When he says ""I'm gonna burn, baby, burn that fat away"", it makes me even more determined to lose weight. Disco Sweat is a low-impact aerobic workout has everything you need to get down, shake your booty, and have loads of fun."
5,I Love this tape!,"This tape has a good workout, great music, positive message and incredible enthusiasm from the participants. If you are an advanced exerciser, you might feel that the exercise is not intense enough, but I think there is a great room where you can be creative and make the exercise harder or gentler according to your needs. My favorite part is 'Born to be alive' where you do lots of punches and power moves which really encourage me and make me feel fantastic. I've seen people who just can't stand R. Simmons, but give this tape a try. You will pop it in especially when you feel blue and feel glad that you did!"
4,Good but I prefer the Blast Off series,"This video is fun. I had a great workout. I kind of added my own little tae-bo moves into the kicks and leg-raises when I felt that it wasn't working me hard enough. I prefer the Blast and Tone, 80's Blast off, and 60's Blast off over this one. Mainly because you work-out harder in a shorter amount of time.:) This video is a great one to have in your collection. The crunches are great."
5,Silly aerobic fun,"Richard Simmons was ahead of his time. Now that camp is cool, I say he is too!This is a nice long aerobic workout that you can gear up or down depending on your fitness/energy level. It's dancy, it's positive and upbeat, it's SO refreshing to see larger size people dancing -- very well, I might add. This tape is a great workout and good fun. Richard is my hero. (I took a class with him once, when he had his own chain of aerobics studio. The man was a slavedriver when it came to situps!)"
5,Indian Ocean Treasure,This book has got to be the best account of an adventure of two boys who find a wreck of a Spanish treasure ship and spend days at a lighthouse snorkeling and removing artifacts. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in recovery of sunken cargo from long ago.
4,Very enjoyable,"I enjoyed this first-in-a-series mystery with all its technical detail of art thieving and CIA masterminding. The start was a little slow, with way too much weather info, and some bits seemed a little rough. But the characters were well-drawn and fun to hang out with. I'll look for the rest of the series."
5,Artscape,I thought this was great. It's the first book I've read by this author and I'll be getting others soon.
5,Wow,I was totally and pleasantly surprised by this book. It was a can't put down story. The characters are well developed and the story builds. Some twists and turns that we're unexpected. Great read! Can't wait to read the next Ike Schwartz mystery.
5,A wonderful ending to a great series.,It was great knowing that a happy ending was in store for Hannah. I loved the entire series about Hannah and Jake. Another great book from Jerry Eicher.
3,A bit of an identity crises.,"The plot would have done better with fewer characters and less mixing of Ike's past and present; hopefully, we'll have moved past that in the next book. Ike is an interesting character, if a tad too perfect, but that's being picky. Ruth, the president of the local college is very well drawn. The story doesn't quite know whether it's focus is the art theft or spies, which dilutes the effectiveness of both. Still, it is interesting, suspenseful, and progresses well. I can't say it was great, but it was good enough that I'll read the next."
2,not good for puffy eyes,i bought this item for puffy eyes. once it is frozen it does not sit well under the eyes.----------update-------------------This product works as advertised. I was keeping it in the freezer thather than the the refridgerator.
1,Bad quality,Very cheaply made. Velcro back does not hold and is irritating against the back of head. It alread broke within 5 months and started leaking blue fluid
2,COOL EYES,i RECENTLY HAD EYE SURGEY AND WAS LOOKING FOR A MASK TO SOOTH MY EYES. i ORDER THEGEL COOLING EYE MASK. THE SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD RECEIVING THE PORDUCT BUT THESE DONOT WORK VERY WELL. WHEN YOU PUT THE MASK IN THE FREEZER TO FREEZE IT YOU HAVE TO LAY IT FLAT SO WHEN YOU USE THE MASK IT DOES NOT FORM TO YOUR EYES IT IS FLAT SOIT REALLY DID NOT WORK FOR MY PURPOSE
1,Do not buy!,This thing is so stiff when iced it will not conform to face and the velcro gets stuck in your hair. I am returning it.
2,CHEAP - waste,"Product arrived on time and in good shape. The mask itself is a waste of money. The mask doesnt fit ny aduct, not shaped to fit a face."
2,it's a cooling mask but not a good one,Every individual is unique and you need a cooling mask to surround your eye. If you human and have a nose then the mask does not touch the black eyes near where your eye meets your nose. It needs some kind of forced fold like swimming goggles to be effective.
4,Plug n Play.. Works great.,"Seems to work just fine in Windows 7 using Jnes. I think I had to map the buttons in Jnes before it worked.. but after that, worked great playing old NES ROMs. We'll see how long it lasts.. That would determine if it gets upgraded to a 5th star."
4,Works great,Had to calibrate in the XP Control Panel but after that it works fantastic. You can't go wrong ordering from 4Triangles. Nicest people I have dealt with.
1,Garbage,Worked for one day then directional pad is switches from unresponsive to only allowing character movement up and to the right. select button is unresponsive
3,"Not exactly what is pictured, but it works.","I received a RETROBIT adapter and not a RETROLINK adapter, which is what I thought I purchased. It might not matter, but it is still a different product that what is pictured. I was hoping to use these to mod a old NES into a HTPC, and still be able to use the old controllers, but now they may not fit.They do, however, work fine."
5,Perfect,"I bought this to play indie games I bought off Steam, and to play flash games. I had no problems with it. It took just seconds to install the driver when I plugged it in. I was able to set the controls using JoyToKey and I was ready to go. No delay and I'm playing with the controller I grew up with. Great product."
5,Definitely worth it.,"This works better than I could have hoped, it really solved all my controller issues. Every USB controller I've tried has had problems, none of them being able to successfully replicate the original NES controller. This is the perfect solution and works like a charm, just plug in an NES controller and you're golden. It's safe to say that I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase."
2,Two player mode: still a mystery,"I received two of these as a gift this Christmas. I plugged in the adapters and the computer recognized them with no problem. However, when they are plugged in simultaneously only input from the first controller is recognized. I have tried testing this through multiple emulators with the same effect. I also swapped controllers around (both function in the first player port), swapped adapters, and also swapped USB ports. I have a message out to the seller asking for a solution since the product description clearly states ""Get 2 adapters to challenge your friends to multiplayer games."" The controller that does get recognized works well so far, but I do notice that the down button doesn't hold down constantly (which is cumbersome in games such as mario 3 where you have to hold down consistently for certain objectives).I'll update the product review as I receive more details on the simultaneous controls."
5,It worked with minimal effort.,I chose 5 stars because I have had zero problems with the product. I literally plugged it into my Dell XPS 8000 with Windows 7 64bit and it worked instantly. I used a standard NES controller and I cannot notice any lag. I just played through the first quest in the Legend of Zelda with no issues.
1,Useless junk,"It's recogized as a USB joystick, and it supports button presses. The only part that doesn't work is the direction pad, it reports absolute garbage there. Without touching anything, the left button reports being constantly tapped. The down arrow does absolutely nothing.The unit I got is labeled Retro-Bit, not RetroLink. Maybe earlier buyers got something that works, but those glory days are long behind. If it were simply unable to make a USB connection, or not recognize a controller, then yeah, I'd figure it to be broken. I just can't imagine how the 5 lines of code that go in-between the two can go wrong, unless it was never implemented."
1,Dont buy it i wouldnt buy it ever again,I dont know if this was the exact product but the 1st time i used it it broke instantly in other words dont buy this item insted buy the mayflash snes adapter it works umteenmilion times better and is multi system usable.
1,HELP!,"Yup, Retro-bit. I don't care. plug it in the USB port, nothing pops up on my computer... I have Mac. How do I get my computer to recognize that the thing is plugged in? No directions... NO CLUE HOW TO USE IT. HELP!"
4,just what i needed,i was building an NES PC and this came in handy...shipped and arrived in a timely manner...for my purposes i needed to crack open the protective bulky shell (which was easy to do if need be). The cord could have been a little shorter but can easily be remedied...all in all great functionality two thumb up
1,Does not work correctly,"I purchased this two of these items, (by the way its says, ""Retro-bit"" not ""retrolink"") and both did not work correctly. I tested them with three different controllers and they kept press the ""b"" button when you would press left on the joy pad. Also there's no ""down"" even after I tried to calibrate it. All in all this product does not work correctly, DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,Piece of trash does not work.,"Like some other reviewers, I also received a ""retro-bit"" adapter as opposed to a ""retro-link"". ...and like those other reviewers I soon realized that this product is absolute garbage. The directional pad doesn't work and therefore this product cannot be used. I really can't believe these things are even manufactured. what a joke. I'll be sending mine back."
5,work really well!,"I tested it with ""Nestopia"" and it works fine. All you have to do is wait a few 10sec for the usb port to found it. Then open nestopia and go to options then input. And then you got to map the buttons. After that it should work everytime.i think this is the best product for NES emulation. you get to use the original controller and also connect the zapper to it if you like Duck Hunt."
4,Another Great Little Critter Book,"I have always loved the Little Critter books and this one did not disappoint. I got this as a Valentine's gift for my 4 year old grandson and he loved it, too. The story and pictures are very cute and if you like Little Critter you should like this book."
1,"hans hoffman, with selected writings by the artist","This item was listed as a book, when in fact it was an exhibition catalog"
2,Not that good,This is a 135 minute film consisting of nine 15 minute segments. The first 8 segments are Christian's pilgrimage. The ninth segment is Christiana's pilgrimage.It consists of a series of still pictures with one narrator narrating it. I would actually rather just read the book.
5,Reduction is fantastic!,"Reduction just plain reduced me to tears of happiness and joy! Easily, my favorite song was Lately. It sort of rings some bells on a past relationship. Keep the great music coming!"
5,A unique collection. . .,". . .of some of the best Tolkien material you may have NEVER seen!JRR Tolkien, best known for ""The Hobbit"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Silmarillion"" also wrote a great deal else! Many readers may be unfamiliar with this fact. Other readers may have seen portions of this book presented in other collections or settings. This one is unique in that it contains not only a collection of short fiction (""Farmer Giles of Ham"", ""Smith of Wooten Major"" and ""Leaf by Niggle"") but also a collection of poetry (""The Adventures of Tom Bombadil"") a non-fiction essay (""On Fairy Stories"") and his very highly regarded modern academic translation of ""Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight"".This book is a MUST for true lovers of Tolkien.Five Stars."
1,not as expected,"Most of this book was very boring. It was not what I had expected. It had a lot of poetry, which is not what I really like."
2,Boring and too many lines,"I suppose if you're a really hard core Sicilian guy, and you like to see endless variations, this might be your book. I was looking for a book that was a lot more into strategy, and I think this lacks strategy. It's really nothing more than an annotated ECO or something. I wish it had sections based on common pawn skeletons and what each side's strategy was to continue. This book is more designed for somebody who wants to memorize a bunch of lines. Great! Then you get into a middle game and have no idea of a plan. Oh yeah, I think the organization of the book, for what it is, is pretty good."
2,$8.95 and oh so misleading,"This is not an idiot's guide to freezer meals as the other reviewer reports. There is only a short paragraph about do's and dont's for freezer e.g. buttermilk and yogurt and breading do not freeze well, This is a book with recipes for chicken beef and pork that you are supposed to thoroughly cook, then store in freezer containers, then microwave or reheat on the stovetop. I am not kidding. This book does not deliver on its premise at all.Most of the chicken recipes require searing the chicken before finishing the meat by stewing or baking.This book did move me in an irritation to look at my regular cookbooks for meals that would freeze well. So far, I have found that Fuschia Dunlop's Hunan pork stir fry dishes can be frozen and steamed. Also, I have baked Italian hot sausages and then packed them in containers with raw green peppers and onions to be reheated in the oven whenever I need a savory dish."
3,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Sorry to be the lone dissenter here but it is inconceivable to me how a live audience could remain awake through this set. Yes, there are a few fiery moments, but the vast majority of this material comes across to me as lacking in energy, repetitive and less than inspired. I gave it three stars because it makes good background music, and is well recorded. A live album of background music makes me wonder about the audience though... maybe they brought their taxes to work on during the show."
4,Improvisations,"Jazz in Paris series have always been consistant in their recordings and artists represented.Stephane Grappelli ""Improvisations"" is another exceptional CD when old recordings can be techically enhanced to sound good.The selection of all the old favourites have been extremely well selected and played by Stephane Grappelli in his distinctive style. ""Fascinatin' Rhythm"" and ""Cheek to Cheek"" are no exception.I hope the the digital recordings on vinyl LPs released by him in 1985 will be added to his album collection in future."
3,WAY TOO DAMN SHORT,"Jazz, aside from freeing the mind and enobling the spirit, is also purchased to be a part of the audio/visual scenery. I need more than 45 minutes to finish a research project or achieve a level of sensuality with a lady! The music is great, but a rip-off in it's brevity"
2,"A worthy effort, but not worth it","This recording features some of the most beautiful piano works ever done by Beethoven. But the interpretation of the pieces are awful. The performer takes certain liberties that are not specified in the musical manuscripts and drowns out certain voices that are more important than the fast moving accompaniment. The performer has also romanticised music that is defintely classical in form. Finally, in the second movement of the Pathetique sonata (Adagio Cantabile) the performer hangs on to the first beat of every measure and in the middle of the piece, the iterpretation is layed back when it should be at it's fullest sound and strength."
3,WLAN Master - The Cisco Aironet 1200,"The Cisco Aironet 1200(AIR-AP1230A-A-K9) is a overall quiet a brilliant product only till the time its working. The one I bought stopped working just after 20 days of purchasing it. Thanks to the Cisco's support got it replaced within a week. Later I found, that there was a manufacturing fault in the whole Aironet1200 series (initial batch).Aironet 1200 Series supports many clients in mixed frequency and different throughput environments for e.g.Tri-mode 802.11a/b/g coverage, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11b/g, etc.Installation is pretty simple and less time consuming. However, implementing WLAN security will take lots of your time. When I installed Aironet 1200, I was not too sure about the WLAN security and the threats that I will be facing, so I contacted Cisco for the proper procedures and best practices for the configuration of the WLAN. After taking their help, I was much satisfied with the product and the support that came along with it."
1,English Please!!!!,I got this movie for my son but it is not in English. I have no idea what the hell language its in but it sux!!! Should state clearly that its not in english.When I played video clips of this movie they were in English. I have been had!Who speaks this language I cannot define?? Dont bother!!Mary.
1,Green Lantern: Esmerald Kinght,I thought I was buying the movie and not a cartoon. Will not buy nother DVD or Blu-ray from amazon. still without opening
3,A little slow for kids,"I liked this movie as an adult. My child, of 3 1/2 lost intrest 30 minutes into it. I assume the complex story and narrative was a bit over his head. I believe the rating on this one to be acuate."
3,Green Lantern Emerald Knighta,"This movie was just okay.There are a few interesting stories, but overall it's a bit flat.Nathan Fillion does a good job voicing GL, but otherwise there really isn't anything special about this movie."
4,"Has a few issues, but isn't bad overall","This movie has some issues which are Killawog not being voiced by Michael Madsen (wth? he voices him well), there's no real main antagonist in it, there's some bad writing present and some action scenes could've been better. While theses are present, they don't hamper this movie as a whole, because its still worth checking out. Go see it. 8/10"
4,Green Lantern fun,I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Definitely not for chidren. But a fun time for teens and above.Not all the stories are great but when you have an anthology that is what tends to happen. I will say I did not get dissappointed in any tales.If you are a fan you will be satisfied. If you want to learn some of the history of the Green Lanterns this dvd will do that.I purchased the Blu-ray/DVD combo and at a reasonable price.
5,Surprisingly Good,I've seen a bunch of DC cartoons that was more of a glorified slide shows... this one was really well animated and stories were very compelling. Great action sequences too. Awesome.
4,Good Movie,"I've always been a ""casual"" fan of GL. I like the character but I don't follow comic books, so I mostly see stuff when it gets made into movies. (I have some graphic novels, but none with GL) To me, this is a good movie because it shows some more about the other characters in the GL universe. Instead of focusing on Hal Jordan, you get to see some of the other GL regulars in personal stories and even a story from the beginning of the GL Corps. Plus, the movie's overall plot is a good setting for ""story time"" between Hal and the young GL he's mentoring. I mostly bought this because I was already buyingGreen Lantern: First Flight (Two-Disc Special Edition)and this was listed as ""frequently bought together"" and it looked good. I'm glad I bought it because I really like it."
1,green,I thought I bought another tape and did not like this one but I' m not a kid so really no opinion
3,Didn't read the fine print,"Didn't read the fine print, I'm usually more careful to avoid animated movies. Just make sure you know it is animated but is still very well done and entertaining. Just not my cup of tea!"
4,Green Lantern: Emerald Knights,"This is a nice piece of animation with a decent story line. Well worth watching, but not in the same league as Batman The Animated Series."
1,didnt watch,wanted the green latern which was in the movie theatre. it is my fault for choosing the wrong green lantern movie.
1,Boring,This movie is boring. The worst DC animated movie so far! Unless you love Green Lantern do not get this movie.
2,Incomplete!,"I'm not really sure how well the batteries work. I read the description & knew I wanted longer-lasting batteries for our phones. But these batteries require a battery cover that is deeper than the one that comes with the phone! So, the batteries don't fit unless you purchase the deeper cover elsewhere. Unless I missed it, this informtion was not provided in the description or technical details.I went to a Verizon store & they sell the batteries complete with the required cover. Also, the cover can be ordered from Motorola."
4,Nice Batt,"The battery is great. The only way you can get six hours of talk time is to be in an extended battery life cellular area. In Seattle, that means being close to the corridor or downtown. If not, you'll be lucky to get 2 hours."
1,Spec'd size don't match original....,Looking for a replacement battery for my p280 of 2 plus years. Excellent phone... The spec dimensions for this battery ( as listed here on amazon )Size (in inches): 2.94 x 4.59 x 1.13are HUGE in comparison with the original battery.Actual battery is something like 2 x 1.5 x .25.WAY OFF... si o no???I will buy direct from Moto.
1,Doesn't Work,Purchased cleaning tape to use on Quantum Ultrium LTO2. Could not get the tape to work. Our computer technician tried all available options. Finally decided that the product was defective. We are in the process of returning at this time. I would not recommend tapes from this manufacturer.
1,Poor software,"I will never buy another Microsoft product. Why? All of a sudden, I could not download updates from my bank -customer service said the money file got corrupt beyond repair. This happened twice now. I had previous versions that worked ok, but Microsoft forces you to upgrade. It is also very unintuitive besides being buggy. Never again. Wish I could get my money back, after all ,it doesn't work!"
1,Trash!,"I have been using this program for five years now and I'm finally going to switch to Quicken. The 'Invoice Designer' is a total waste of time... it just hasn't worked for years and Microsoft will do NOTHING to get it to work. This is the unwanted step child of Microsoft, so please don't waist your time!"
1,Ugly,"Ugly, plain not working, cannot believe MS would release something with this level of quality. So totally not working. Lots of MS ad here and there, cannot even do a balance sheet right. This thing is so fragmented it cannot do one thing right. Avoid."
2,Too old for support,"I needed this version to assist my parents with their finances. However, I did not realize that Microsoft Money no longer existed and there is no support for it anymore. It says it requires an update to run that is no longer available. After several hours of trying to find an update online somewhere I finally found a way around it, but I would not buy Microsoft Money unless you absolutely need that product."
2,Not worth the money.,Very complicated to use. Hard to store and retreive data. Wouldn't recommend it.
2,Not much new,I upgraded from Money 2003 to Money 2007 thinking there would be 'somethhing' new or useful. I was wrong. Come on Microsoft. Four years with nothing I can use or new? I do like the new webpage look though. One star for the program and one for the new webpage-style look. Hope four years from now brings something useful.
1,got worse for investors,"I was very happy with Money 2004 but upgraded because of the 2 year timeout on some of the services. In 2007, they've made the Quantity and Total Cost fields required on recurring investments. So now if you're tracking your 401k or any investment where you're doing fixed amounts you have to put junk data in there and then deleted when it auto calculates the actual values each month which is always frustrating because if you don't do it in the right order it goes back and fills in fields you just cleared.Other than that, no noticeable difference between it and the older versions except they rearranged everything.This is basic buy cost averaging investing 101 done by anyone with a 401k or monthly investment regiment. I don't know how they could have messed this up, but they did."
1,Don't believe Microsoft,"Microsoft just crippled my copy of Money 2003. It is no longer supported so I cannot use the online functions. The solution, offered by Microsoft is to buy Money 2007 which will convert your older files. IT DOESN'T WORK. The Money 2003 files are not completely converted to Money 2007. Save your money and stay with a cripled Money 2003. Maybe it's time to think about Quicken!"
5,Microsoft Money upgrade worked,I had been looking into a solution to upgrade my microsoft money but kept running into issues with having to upgrade my program. I found the version I needed on Amazon and it worked great. I upgraded my version of Microsoft Money and was able to convert it to my new Quicken program.
4,Microsoft Money 7,"This product is all I expected. I would love more support for 401's and IRA's, but it's a great product."
2,Data sharing seems to be a problem,"I upgraded from MS Money 2006 due to a bug that affected the way investment transactions are tracked. Credits into the cash account kept being reported as debits, and vice-versa. I would manually correct these downloaded transactions, only to have them re-appear next time I opened MS Money 2006.Sadly, MS Money 2007 Deluxe seems little improved, if at all. While the above described bug has been fixed, new bugs are now present. Further, MS Money 2007 no longer integrates with MSN Money online; hence, all the portfolio data for investments must either be entered manually into MSN Money's online portfolio feature, or one simply accepts that the portfolio can only be accessed and maintained with MS Money 2007 on one's home computer. No more remote tracking of one's investment portfolio!In all, it is not worth upgrading to MS Money 2007 in my opinion."
4,Perfect for what I need,"Simple program with easy interface. I love the checkbook, electronic downloads, and categorizing aspect of it all so I can easily see where my money is being spent from all of my accounts. I haven't used many other programs, but this is simple and easy to use and does everything I want."
1,Money 2007,"This is good for folks who have lotsa finance things to do. It is NOT good for someone like myself who just wants to keep simple accurate records. I don't wanna be prompted to go for the glitz each time I open the program. I wish I never bought it. Len Norris, [...]"
5,The value of Money,Money has built in value for the none accoundant person. With little or no training a novice can become familar with this software in a very short time. Microsoft has a winner.
1,Money 2007 is just a waste of MONEY.,"I have transitioned from Money-2004 to 2007 premium. I agree with most of the viewers comments here. I give only one star for this product.Functional flaws are there not only at the debt reduction planner, even mortgage interest reports for the end of the year tax return will not be correct if you dont do it in specific way.NOT HAVING ABILITY TO ATTACH A CASHED CHECK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION STATEMENT IS A MAJOR DRAWBACKOF THE SYSTEM AS I HAVE TO KEEP THEM MANUALLY ORGANIZED IN MY PERSONAL FOLDERS.IT is a WASTE OF MONEY in my opinion to buy this if you have any older version and dont care damn about the look and feel."
4,MS Money 2007 REBATE issues,"Typical rebate process. Reject for supposed invalid info, and make me jump through hoops to get the $20. I hate mail-in rebates for this very reason. It is just as bad as the insurance companies. Deny and see if they re-file. Software is exactly what I wanted, but I would like to not go through the hassle to get the advertised price."
3,ms money upgrade to 2007 delux edition,"I am an American ex patriot residing in Madrid Spain. Since ms money products are not available within Spain, I used Amazon. The product is 100 times better than anything on the local market AND THE LOCAL market programs are not designed nor compatible with our way of thinking. MS money is a great product and this version is more or less the same as the 2006 version. I would not recommend an upgrade just for the sake of upgrading. But if you have to decide between the 2006 and/or 2007 and there is a great difference in price, take the 2006 version."
4,"Great tool, not as intuitive as 2000","I upgraded to this version from Money 2000. The interface looks cleaner, and the reports and budgeting options are better. I do find it a little less intuitive than the older version that I am used to. Overall, I'm happy with this product and there is room for me to get to know it better. I think it will last me for several years."
3,"Nice, but....",I've been a Money user since 1999 and each year upgraded to the new version...That stopped in 2005 when I noted that the Money Express feature was absent. Money express is very convenient for entering transactions without having to run the entire Money program and I use it a lot for that.Each year I complain to Microsoft about the loss of Money Express and each year my complaint falls on deaf ears.So this year I added that I will not upgrade Money beyond the 2004 version I have until they make Money Express available again.
3,"Getting accounts put in is easy, but keeping them in after conversion is not.","I admit to being a bit stressed getting started. I find that it is not just a simple matter of entering the check register. If there were just a tutorial on the disk that could be chosen by level of beginning, some knowledge, more knowledge and advanced, I think one could start with beginning and keep going until ready to move forward.I tried to convert Quicken files to Money07, and that is where I lost the detail information. I have ending balances, but not the details.Thank you"
1,Poor Quality - Buggy and Slow,"As a longtime user of Microsoft Money 2001 I will now be switching reluctantly to Quicken. Why? Because MS Money failed to download all my transactions from the bank, leading to a completely false balance, and its reports are slow and sometimes do not want to appear at all.I am amazed that Microsoft should fall short over such a relatively simple product, and one that has been around for so long.I can only hope that Quicken is better!"
3,Window's Dressing,Microsoft Money 2007 works great and does everything that it states it will do however it is not worth upgrading from the previous 2 versions. There really is no value add to 2007 other than the looks. No new features worth mentioning. The only reason I upgraded is that Capital One bank would not work with Money 2000 so it made sense to go the latest. It's a great product if you're not using anything right now but it is a terrible upgrade since it really doesn't buy you much.
2,"Not as good as Money 2000, but I had no choice. Thanks MSFT","It gets hung up when I try and shut down my computer (background banking...whatever that is). It doesn't have the express window which I used so often. I felt it was necessary since I did not get updates anymore for my Money 2000. This is not nearly as good a product, or as stable."
5,Great functionality,Everything I expected - this program runs circles around Quicken. The Budgeting Feature is far superior and much easier to use.
3,No major changes,"I had Money 2005 and bought this update. I was disappointed to find that there were no significant changes either in the interface or features (at least the ones I use). This may really be saying that this genre of software has fully matured and has no major direction to go in improving from previous versions, kind of like MS Office applications.If you have a previous version of Money (2005 or 06), I would suggest not wasting your money and staying with what you have. Otherwise, I highly recommend Money for new users. It is very useful and provides the necessary tools to have an organized financial system and plan."
2,No significant improvements over Money 2003.,"I had been using Money 2003 and decided to upgrade. There wasn't any pressing need, but upgrading once every four years isn't bad. I was hoping there were some significant additional features or improvement. I've been using it for approx a month and it doesn't appear that there were any.- They did allow customization of your home page, but it only allow 2 columns.- I didn't both using the new budget tool as I want to track more than just the essentials.One very annoying thing:When I uninstalled Money 2003, it broke my Money 2007 installation. Money 2007 complained that it couldn't find its registration. I had to uninstall Money 2007 and then reinstall it again.Note to Microsoft: Uninstalling one application should NEVER break another application. Please remove this proprietary Microsoft ""feature."""
2,Microsoft Money 2007 don't waste you time,"Microsoft Money 2007 don't waste you time. The product has some nice features and the feel of more reliable products such as MS Excel and MS Word however there are numerous instabilities with the product. I tried MS Money 2007 Deluxe. The application frequently stalls, it will not reopen files it has created and Money's file repair features do not work. It sometimes asks for the same updates to its software, and many times it will not close properly. Money's customer support does not appear to have the necessary tools to resolve these product issues. I have personally reloaded Money Deluxe 4 times on advice of MS Money's customer support and created nearly a dozen new files because the previous Money files failed to open for some unknown reason. The software has too many bugs."
1,No longer supports Pocket PC's,"If you want to upgrade and continue to use Money on your Pocket PC, don't bother. This new version does not support Pocket PC's. Would be useful information for MS to include on their product description since that's a rather important change! Can't figure out why they've cut this off since they also write the software for Windows Mobile."
3,Needs work,New issue did not pick up my previous records. It also is not as easy to use. It needs some updating or fixes.
3,Did I really buy 2007?,The only beef I have with this is that I don't see much innovation since 2000 when I last owned the product. Clearly I thought it was a good product then or I wouldn't have repurchased it. I'm just a firm believer in not having to release a new version of something if you haven't made a drastic change. College textbooks have scarred me for life.
3,Money for retired user,It is OK. Not worth the bucks but does what I wanted after getting through all the introduction garbage.
1,Is there a no star for this software?,"This has to be the worse software that I have ever purchased..I downloaded the cd and went thru most of it, I didn't want to go online with Money, and tried to find out how I could by-pass that entry and each time I clicked the not load button I was kicked off and went back to my desktop.I wish I had never seen this much less bought it."
1,Big dissapointment,"I bought and installed Microsoft Money 2007 Deluxe. It installed fine with no errors. When I launch the program, it launches fine but when I go to run the reports, they don't work. I tried uninstaling and re-installing several times and no luck.I will return for a refund. I don't have time to waste calling them to find out why their product does not work on a brand new computer.Very dissapointed since I have been using Money since 99. I will now switch to Quicken."
3,Slurped to Death,"Billy May was an amazingly prolific arranger back in the 50s (and before and after to a lesser degree). This two-disc compilation of tracks from various Capitol albums shows his range. It also, unfortunately, shows his limitations...or at least his overuse of his favorite, signature gimmick, the so-called ""slurping saxes."" After listening to five or six or more tracks on this compilation, you kind of wish he'd found at least one more gimmick. The title is in a sense revealing: what you get is ""all of him."""
2,Not their best,"I have lots of Firm videos, and this one is my least favorite. It is very dated, and is spliced from other videos. I myself, like new videos to add to my collection, not re-mixes of old ones. The moves are also very 80s; grapevines, plyos, etc. Lots of jumping so it's very high impact. I would recommend you buy a different Firm tape, or at least read the reviews from other tapes first before you buy this one. My faves are: Crosstrainers, Total Body Shaping Mix, Time-Crunch."
2,Disappointing and misleading.,"I was very disappointed with this FIRM volume. I have several other FIRM workout tapes and this is by far the worst I've seen. The floor aerobics portion is continually billed throughout the workout as being ""low impact aerobics"". It is not at all low impact except for the occasional marching. Mostly it is actually high impact with jumps, jumping jacks, and leaping side lunges. Aside from this, the music does not match the workout pace and could be confusing to some. I am also concerned about the safety of the abs section. They do something called a rocking crunch that can't be good for the back. It certainly hurts mine, so I won't do them that way. I love the FIRM and they have some great tapes. This is not one of them."
5,Great for your video rotation!,"This tape will give you a very effective cardio workout in about 45 minutes. Never boring, the older Firm videos really deliver. This tape is fun and motivating, with beautiful production quality. The intensity is just about right - not killer, but with an 8 inch step (14 inch for some moves), it will definitely burn those calories, build those bones, and shape those muscles!"
3,Not what I expected,"I was surprised that this video required so much equipment: low step, high step, and weights. Also, their ""low-impact"" aerobics involved a lot of bouncing, which I cannot do. The transitions were good and kept the tape from being boring, but the leaders traded off with extremely fake smiles and theatrical hand-waving. A real turn-off. Not for beginners; maybe I'll try it again when I'm in better shape."
4,"Enjoyable, makes the time go by quickly.","I liked this video. I have several other Firm tapes, and there are a couple I like better, but the cardio moves are fun, and it has an ab section I don't hate! I will use this one often."
2,Not for me,"I wasn't in the best mood today, but since I usually love the FIRM, I thought I could do it and it could lift up my spirits. Boy was I wrong. The aerobic sections with Allie were okay, but I really did not like Lisa Kay. I felt like they were making the workout choreography way too complicated. I have never been good with L-steps, but I tell ya, I just did not like Lisa Kay's cueing. Also, Lisa Kay looked, I wouldn't say pudgy, but not as fit as the other instructors. Looked to me like she had a belly. Anyways, overall, I did not like this tape. I will probably give it one more try in view of the fact that I was in a bad mood, and if I like it better, I may come back and give it a better review, but I doubt it. I ended up cutting it off and popped in Christi Taylor. It just wasn't my kind of FIRM. I was very disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this video after reading good reviews on most of the tapes by The Firm. I should have rented it first. If you are in any kind of decent shape at all, this video will do nothing for you. I was expecting more work with weights--there was hardly any. I have wimpy muscles and it was still too easy for me.The instructors talk constantly, only they're calling out moves you won't be doing for a few more seconds. Then, moves are only repeated a couple times and as soon as they're caught on to, you're off to another brief set of moves--again, with instructors talking about something else.Too choppy, too confusing, too wimpy, too fakey. I felt like I took a brisk walk around the block when I was done, not like I had a ""Total Body Workout"", and I'm not exactly a fitness machine.Hope the other Firm videos are better."
4,This is what I was looking for in an exercise video.,"This is the first work out video I bought so I don't have much to compare it to. I work out a lot at a gym and got tired of having to go in all the time. (plus I get tired of being on a machine for 30 to 45 minutes at a time.) So the video adds some variety to my work out schedule. I'd say I'm in good shape and the video definately makes me sweat. It is hard to get all the moves right at first but I don't worry about it: I just keep moving. I get a little more in sync each time I watch it. Sometimes (when I want an extra hard work out) I'll pause the video between sets and do push ups, kicks, etc. I think the ab section could be harder."
5,High Intermediate Level,"This volume of the Firm is not as grueling as the famous ""classic"" series, but I like it more. It combines fun cardio routines and tall box work with a thorough abs segment. The three instructors are personable, not fake. Especially Allie Strickland, who makes me smile.They brought back the old set and use great music, especially in the classical cooldown."
3,For occasional viewing,"I have a ton of firm tapes and have been doing these workouts for about 10 years... I do a lot of the old total body tapes because the new ones are too easy. Fat Blaster falls in this category. On the down side, Lisa Kay is a terrible instructor - she doesn't call the moves in time and sometimes calls them incorrectly - I have the routines memorized and she sometimes still confuses me with her instructions. On the up-side (if you like aerobics) the workout is faster and more high energy than other Firm workouts. But since it's easy, what I do is I add it to another Firm parts tape like tough tape, standing legs, abs hips & thigh total body or sandwich it halfway in between the routines on the time crunch workout. So it works to extend the cardio section of any of the other workouts. It's too easy to do it just by itself, I find."
4,Nice cardio variety...,"This video is mainly cardio, but there are different forms of it in this video. There are 4 step segments, some hi/lo impact aerobics, and 4 limb aerobics using lighter weights. Tall box climbs are also featured in this video, where you step up and down on the tall box which really elevates the heartrate. Three different instructors (Lisa Kay, Nancy Tucker, Allie Strickland) lead this workout alternating between segments. There is also a fun abs section near the end of the video. It's a fun cardio workout with high energy music. You will need a step and a tall box or stool, light weights and a dowel or broom handle for balance. Not a really tough workout, but does the job in getting the heartrate up."
4,"Good product, smaller then what was expected.","These splices are easy to pinch shut, but do not place much pressure on the wire. Therefore, the wire can fairly easily slip out. I would not recommend these to someone who intends to put them somewhere where they would be in constant motion. But, they are great for any other reason other than that."
2,Disappointed in quality,I too measured my glider and when I received the order found that the cover was not an accurate fit. I did not comment at that time because it was 'workable' and I am not a complainer. Now after two years (I know it sounds like a long time) the cover is hardened and falling apart in BIG flakes to expose the insulating materials within. I only comment on this now because I have a full size glider cover which I purchased more than five years ago that is holding up and is still as pliable as new. Both covers are located in the same patio area under a lattice cover. I research based on reviews and price and at the time this was a good deal ($30.)Now I am not so sure and am very disappointed in the product.
1,Not true to size,"Beware! I measured our glider to be sure this cover would fit. When we received the cover and attempted to put it on the glider, it didn't fit. It wasn't even close. The cover seemed to be an entire foot shorter than claimed."
1,ZERO STARS-NOT WATERPROOF!,"DO NOT BUY THESE COVERS FROM PROTECTIVE COVERS, INC. THEY ARE NOT WATERPROOF! DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS AND THEN HAVE THEM ""DISCOVER"" RIPS ON COVER SO WARRANTLY COULD BE VOIDED. ALL WILL LEAK LIKE A SIEVE FROM DAY ONE."
4,A fascinating journey to an ancient faith,"Peter Guilquist's Becoming Orthodox is a fascinating journey to discovering an ancient faith by a group of modern day evangelical Christians.It provides details on how this group of faithful came to question their status quo faith and to yearn for answers in the historical church, its teachings, its practices and most importantly where in the present day this historical church could be found?Their journey led them to discover the Eastern Orthodox Church as the true historical Church of Jesus Christ and His Apostles handed down to us through ages through the bishops by Apostolic Succession.Complicated theological issues are treated with a clear and simple approach."
2,Of mixed emotion...,"While the enthusiasm expressed in this work is encouraging, as is the energy witnessed in its expression, it is nonetheless wanting in the extent of its content.Written while the author and his colleagues were new to Orthodoxy, it expresses much more of the 'coming home' sentiment and excitement than it does a detailed description of Orthodox theology or the Church. It is the author's 'conversion experience,' and not so much a discussion of what he was converting to, that is the focus of the work.Yet this book will still find a strong readership in those who are from a Protestant/Evangelical background and are considering Orthodoxy, or are simply intrigued and interested in it. From that perspective, 'Becoming Orthodox' offers insights that will strike close to home, and address many of the issues that are encountered when viewing Orthodoxy from such a background."
