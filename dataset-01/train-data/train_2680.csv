3,OK but not awesome (for me),"arrived 7/30/12. A tasty snack....just not quite what I was expecting. Seems a little too sweet (maybe thats me), also the texture (again for me) was odd. Will use them as a lunch bag snack as they have protein in them....good to keep me going when I don't get to go for a real break (work in an E/R)....much prefer the protein/fiber bar that has the peanut butter & chocolate flavor. Hard to find them in the stores these days.....oh well...enjoy!"
4,"Not their best, but good.","I've tried a few of their go lean bars and rolls and this one isn't as good as their peanut butter caramel, but its still pretty good. Its worth trying."
5,Scrumptous!,The only drawback to these ROLL energy bars is that they are so good that you have to exercise a high degree of self control or your supply will suddenly be depleted>
4,2-year old daughter loves this book,"My daughter loves this book. I don't know why. It is so simple and has so few words. We read it before bed and then I put her in her crib and she's reciting it til she falls asleep.I wish there were more ""feelings"". The book has only happy, cranky, sleepy and sad and one page of 4 feelings. But my daughter loves it, so it gets 4 stars."
3,Little bit disappointed,My granddaughter wasn't very interested in this book. I felt the facial expressions weren't all as I expected.
2,not really very good,"The PW reviewer might have been a little careless in political characterization, but I think that this book does soften Whitman's views, and muddle Lincoln's, to try to put them both in the same place. The analysis of the poetry might be fine, but the political analysis isn't. The portrait of Chase, and the descriptions of the ""radical Republicans"", is one-sided. Mary Todd Lincoln is bad and horrible, and somehow that is conflated with her sympathy for the slaves & for a war against slavery. (Whitman only had lovely relationships, apparently). Also, it is true that there are little irritating errors, the ""relationship"" between Howells & Whitman in 1860 being a clear one."
4,illuminating with one fatal flaw,"The only problem I had with the book was the author's obsession with Whitman's so-called ""personal"" life. I can't say the H word since xena keeps deleting my comments, but take it from me, Walt was NOT what Epstein seems to think he was. When Carpenter and Wilde tried to corner him about it, he was absolutely AGHAST that anyone would do that, let alone think HE would ever be so depraved. Whitman was America's only conscious poet. Lincoln was America's only conscious president. You can't get there having a corrupt soul."
2,Tendentious and dull,"For anyone who hasn't lived through the last 50+ years, this may be a useful review of all the terrible things that have happened and mistakes made. For those who've been aware citizens, it's on the dull side."
3,"WOW, the obvious!","If you want to read a 400 page book that will state and re-state obvious truths that any thinking person has reached considering man's inhumanity to man, then buy this book! It does have some impressive journalistic history of genocides, and correctly places Maoist China in there unlike many such works, but it is very repetitive and though Glover is supposed to be a philosopher one will find nothing ethically challenging here (did you know genocide is wrong? DUH)."
2,War is bad.,"I should preface my review by mentioning that I am, at present and for all eternity, on page 131. This book contains encyclopedia entries on the major world figures and historic events of the twentieth century. Nothing insightful here...you will just have to read a real book that doesn't attempt to chronicle the horrors of the twentieth century, comment on them, explain why they happened, and propose solutions for how they could have been prevented...all in 300 pages."
5,Great,"Excellent. Extremely well written. A philosophy book that is a real page turner. Like a great novel you will find it hard to put down, but weeks later you will find yourself revisiting its pages in your mind. Buy this book."
5,Tell the world,Buy this book!! It makes you hope that world leaders will do the same and learn some very important lessons. The Cuban missile crisis section was heartstopping. Mr Bush take note.
2,Iffy Lamp,"I was so excited to get this lamp! A friend of mine had gotten a different kind and it's fantastic. This lamp, however, was a disappointment. It's not very well-made and kept giving me shocks when I plugged it in. I finally ended up tossing it. Go for a higher-end Himalayan salt lamp, they're worth the extra money."
4,Fed Up!,Received in good condition and in a timely manner. I agree with her that people should listen to their bodies more and not become obsessed with dieting to live the images of others.
2,Unfulfilled Potential,"This book has great potential but it doesn't live up to it. Instead of it being an expose, it's a comment. In other words, the author talks about things but doesn't go beyond that. It was refreshing to see some things in print, but some serious research would have helped this book. Perhaps, even, the author should have written a novel, based on the contents."
2,Disappointing in writing style and content.,"The author wrote this book instead of a sermon and he should stay with his original profession, pastoring. This book is more of a how-to than a revealing expose on a very ""elite"" profession. It is truly a quick read and it leaves you wondering more about the author and what inspired him to write this novelette. There is a story here to be told, it just did not happen this time."
1,Do not waste your money and time on this book.,This book is worthless. It does not give a whole lot of insight about the black church that I believe an average church goer is not aware of.It is full of sound and fury but signifies nothing (to borrow from Shakespare). I could kick myself for wasting my time on this gabbage.
3,Pretty good book but no shocker,"Pulpit Confessions didn't shock me and frankly, if you've been raised in the Black church it won't shock you either. We've all heard these stories. What makes Pulpit Confessions so amazing is that it's written by a minister. He's not justifying the behavior that he's describing he's just being brutally honest. Once you start reading it becomes obvious why he has to use a pen name. The book is too short and certain topics should have been discussed in more depth but overall it's a good book and it's the only one of it's kind."
5,I will give this as a gift to my clergy . . . .,"I will give this books as required reading to the ministers under my guidance. The author was honest and bold in his challenge to black minsters and churches. He doesn't make himself to be a martyr, but exposes his own shortcomings as well. It is a fine and timely publication.Rev. Lester Martin"
2,Disappointing,"I am saddened to know that this individual used this platform to highlight all of the negatives when there was an excellent opportunity to appreciate the value of the black church in the community. Yes, some of the things mentioned do happen in the church, however so much the better goes on too. Please don't let one person paint a picture for you to judge the church of today by. No matter what may or has happened in the church, God is still in control!Bless Your Spirit Rev. Matt Yarbrough, Jr. RevYarb@aol.com"
2,dissapointed with this particular motherboard.,hmm I bought it and it gave me a lot of problem with CMOS. It seems to reset the settings everytime I reboot. I liked the board but end up returning it. Asus is an excellent motherboard brand. I just had back luck with this product. If you search on the internet you will see people have problem with BIOS on this mobo.
5,Workhorse Paper,I use this paper on a regular basis with my HP B9180 pro printer (HP 38 pigmented inks). Prints are gallery quality. Well worth the price.
5,Missing issues 9 and 10 but still worth it!!,"Awesome!!! The perfect start to the Spawn collection. The only unfortunate thing about this collection is that it doesn't include issue 9 the one that introduced Angela, Cogliostro and Medieval Spawn. They also removed issue 10. I think it had to do with some legal issues with the writers. Otherwise it is a must have."
5,Good Quaity Canvas Marvelously well stretched with cleats,"I have been an inactive fine arts painter for 25 years and decided to go back to painting. The product under advice here is one of the best I have encountered in 50 years of painting. Also, the price and shipping were very efficient and reasonable. I hope I have to use your services for many, many years to come, but that depends upon customer satisfaction and my ability to gear up production. Thanks for asking."
2,Lame,"No audio, even though the actual reportage of the incident included one of the most famous extemporaneous radio commentaries of all time."
2,"Remarkably Bad, but Interesting","Saying that Anthony Newley sounds tired and breathless, would be an understatement. Still, it's as if he's doing a late-in-career characature of the real Newley, and that can be fun to imagine and (almost) listen to."
2,not enough bang for the buck,"It seems a crime that, in order to get John McCormack singing ""I'm Falling in Love with Some One,"" you have to shell out big bucks for this CD. I can't abide opera, and there are too many arias here sung in foreign languages to justify a capital investment. McCormack also does a striking rendition of ""Because,"" which is missing from this CD. maybe we'll get lucky and Archeophone will put together a few disks, all in English, and I'd pay their price, steep though it usually is."
5,Best Boxing DVD Out There,"This is a truly great DVD for those just beginning to learn boxing. It goes guides you through using wraps, mitts, speed bag, heavy bag, etc. Even if you don't have any boxing equipment, there is a huge shadow boxing section that allows you to practice your punches without equipment. At the end there is a jump rope workout and a medicine ball workout. It doesn't move too fast, yet by the end of the DVD you feel you have actually learned a lot about boxing.I use this video 2-3 times a week as a great cardio workout. Once I get these skills down I'll probably try the advanced DVD. If you are new to boxing or just want to refine your skills by learning from the pros, this DVD is for you!"
4,The music is great on this one.,"I remember this album in the winter of 1992. I was working at a factory and I heard the first single kickin it. I've always liked After 7 and I bought singles for the most part. But I decided to buy this album, on cassette of all things back then. But then again Cd's were to high priced for me then. But I listened to this album and I was hooked by the music. Dallas Austin (Producer of BoyzIIMen and ABC=Another Bad Creation.) and Randy Ran. I was like damn this is nice. I bought the Cd later and I think you should check it. Believe me you'll like it."
3,Unseen...almost,"Duran Duran appear on fewer than half of the pages. The rest show photographs of other personalities from the same era in the Birmingham music and club scene. The highlights are the caption comments by the band (and others) that accompany the photos and the few photos of the band that are different than those published elsewhere, such as those outside the studio in which they recorded their first album. I enjoyed it but was a little put off by the bait and switch/cashing in on Duran factor."
3,Wishing for more....,This book was a good collection of images from the early 80's Romantic beginnings but not as much new Duran Duran as it looks like it should be. It is a good testament to those who ventured into an individualic world with make-up and wardrobe. There is some dedication to the early development of Duran Duran with behind the scenes photos.
1,these are not postcards,"these are small pieces of photo paper, they are not heavy stock as i would expect postcards to be. if you want to print a photo, you can use these but there are cheaper options available. i was really hoping to print postcards but this weak paper would need a protective envelope before it is mailed."
2,Waste of time and effort,"This is the cheez whiz of cheeses, the box wine of wines, you get the analogy.The cake is fluffy and tasteless, like a sugar coated vaseline sandwich.I love coconut and I love cake but this did not satisfy my craving for either.I really wanted to like this. Making a cake from scratch is a bother, but, as with most things in life, there are no shortcuts and if it's worth doing it's worth doing it well."
3,Reader's Moderate Pleasure,"Doran Fairchild, antique dealer, goes away for a few nights with her neighbor, Reverend Rodney Chelmarsh, Vicar of St. Crispin's. The lovers find it difficult to keep the tryst a secret when burglaries, thefts and murders abound.I enjoyed the Sayers-like references to literature and the Jonathan Gash-like discussion of antiques. However, you should avoid this book if you find it irritating when (1) heroines withhold evidence from the police or (2) heroines, knowing that there is a murderer at large, place themselves in dangerous situations."
4,Kingston - Memory,Kingston memory helped to smooth out my video editing.Works just fine at a very good price except for the shipping cost.
5,Works very well!,Kingston provides a system (on Amazon) where a buyer can look up the specific memory card required for their brand and model computer thus taking the guesswork out of selecting. The memory cards worked very well once installed.
1,"Interesting premise, but uninteresting execution","As a person who loved Celestial Matters, I was really surprised to dislike All Of An Instant. The premise is rather creative, I'll grant, but the characters were largely uninteresting. Also, a lot of the details of the concepts, such as the recycling consciousness of the Drums, ended up sounding kind of like spacey mumbo-jumbo when overdescribed. I was frankly annoyed by the constant singing and vowing that the main characters seemed to be engaging in. I'd recommend this one as a library find, I had to force myself through it at times.Do read Celestial Matters, but skip this one."
2,Uninterestingly different,"All of an Instant takes place outside of normal spacetime in a ""world"" called the Instant. Garfinkle spends upwards of 60 pages or so just introducing to you the concepts of this new world. Though he does finally get around to inserting plot into the story, it only really works for the middle portion of the book. The big huge problem that is faced by the creatures of this world is encountered with a third of the book left to go, and it is entirely too obvious that the resolution to this problem is the climax to his novel. It also was obvious how the story would most likely end, and as such, it was very unsatisfying at the end. This book is an interesting curiosity, but I wouldn't call it a great read."
5,Awesome,"...I bought this based on the Amazon review. This is the first time I have taken the time to write a review. I can't stop playing ""Special Occasion"" followed by ""Passion Dance"" and ""Strut"". If you are looking to set the mood for a romantic evening this is the album to play..."
4,great dvd,"I really like this dvd. I've been doing yoga at the gym, but it's not prenatal. This allows me to do yoga at home, and focus on the important areas for pregancy/childbirth. Stay away from the ""Baby & Me"" yoga dvd and get this one instead. It's much closer to true yoga with poses and breathing techniques, not a lot of new age mumbo jumbo."
2,This DVD requires thought,"We own another Yoga Zone DVD, and it is great, so naturally I bought this one when my wife got pregnant. This is NOT the same format as the other Yoga Zone DVD. It is a guy (and his 8-month pregnant wife as a model) advising you the different positions. There is no background music, and the poses are held for long periods of time while the guy explains correct form.We were not interested in ""performing"" or getting the forms exactly right, but rather light exercise that was safe and easy to do. This video is more for someone with extensive Yoga experience."
5,"Easy for Yoga beginners, Relaxing","I had bought this tape and not used it, but 2 months into my pregnancy my husband begged me to try it to see if it would help relieve my stress a little. I'm not sure it was a great work out, but it did get me streching and moving a little and really did help me calm down and feel a little more peaceful. I've never done yoga before and found the instruction simple and easy to follow."
3,FOR BEGINNERS ONLY!,"If you are a physically active person or have ever taken a yoga class, this tape isn't for you. Even in pregancy I wanted more. But, if you are a beginner, this tape may be just right. In general, the postures are good. But there is no soothing music or silence. You hear talking throughout. I often did the poses with the TV muted and my own music playing. And don't expect to work up a sweat or hold the poses long enough. I would often have the remote control close by to pause the tape so I could feel the stretches equally on each side. Despite all of this, I would use the tape about 3 times a week in my last trimester, mostly to quiet my mind and get back in focus."
1,WHAT A JOKE.,THIS VIDEO NEEDS TO BE REALLY TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET. FIRST IF YOU CAN GET PASS THE ANNOYING GUY YOUR DOING GOOD. THEN HIS WIFE EVEN LOOKS LIKE SHE WANT'S TO TELL HIM TO SHUT UP A COUPLE OF TIMES. I THOUGHT THIS VIDEO WAS JUST A WASTE OF TIME. IT JUST ANNOYED ME THE WHOLE TIME. EVERYTIME SHE MOVED INTO A DIFFERENT POSITION HE WOULD TALK AND TALK AND TALK WHILE SHE WAS JUST BENT IN THESE POSITIONS AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE'S NOTICING THAT BEING IN THESE POSITIONS IN A LONG TIME WOULD START TO HURT BUT HE'S MORE INTO WHAT HE'S SAYING. PLEASE TAKE THIS VIDEO OFF THE SHELF! OR THROW IT IN THE TRASH THAT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE!!
1,Not for Intermediate Yogis,"This would be good for someone who has never taken yoga before. I was slightly put off that a man was talking all about the poses that are beneficial to a woman's body during pregnancy and delivery. I doubt he has ever been pregnant so I find it hard to relate to. Plus there is no real flow, it does not feel like a full practice but rather how to do some basic poses. There were one or two poses that felt pretty good, but they are basic moves that you would probably find in any other dvd."
1,So Annoying I Could Only Handle Doing This Once,"I wish I would have known about all the different prenatal Yoga videos out there! There has definately got to be something better than this. As it is, this was the only one my local video store had. I was six months pregnant when I watched it. I kept waiting for the instructor to stop talking so I could enjoy the poses and have a relaxing workout. Oh no, he talks constantly the whole 50 minutes of the video, explaining in excrutiating detail all the poses. He spends so much time explaining the poses...and then they're only held for seconds before moving on to the next one. So most of the time I was not doing anything because I was waiting for him to finish explaining the next pose, and I just wanted him to show it already so I could do it! Don't waste your time or money."
2,Not for beginners,"This video is not for pregnant moms with no yoga experience - some of the instruction was hard to follow and the poses - even the ones that might seem simple - were sometimes quite difficult for me (I'm 7 and one half months pregnant).There was no pregnancy preparation (e.g., kegels) either.I'm still looking for a good pre-natal DVD with light stretching and exercise."
2,Not what I expected,"This video is more for instruction on poses that are good for pregnancy, rather than actually doing yoga. I expected a yoga video that would be like going to a yoga class. I also was hoping for something that conditioned muscles for a better labor and delivery, but that's not what this video is for either. Though this was my first experience with yoga, it was disappointing. I'm going to be more careful now, to be sure that any videos I buy in the future are exactly what I'm looking for.I don't think this video is a complete waste - and I will continue to use it. But I am back online looking for a better prenatal yoga video that I will use as my regular prenatal yoga workout."
3,Yoga Zone - Postures for Pregnancy,I found this video to be easy to follow. It included postures that were easy for a beginner and more advanced poses. I would recommend this video to someone who has some yoga experience.
1,yadda yadda yadda,"I had heard really good things about Yoga Zone, so it was with a high degree of anticipation that i popped the video to watch. The narrator blathers on and on, while his wife acts like a Stepford Wife, exclaiming as non-sequiturs how well she feels. When you're done with the tape the first thing you feel is mental fatigue. This video cannot be watched more than twice (I tried). He seems to be a nag and she seems to be brainless."
4,INVENT IT MAGNET KIT,"I BOUGHT THIS OVER THE WEEKEND COULD NOT WAIT TO TRY IT. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT I USED IT TO MAKE MAGNETS (OF COURSE), BUT I ALSO MADE MAGNETIC PAPER DOLLS FOR MY NIECE. THE ONLY THING IS BE SURE IT DRIES BEFORE YOU TOUCH IT. BUY IT TODAY YOU WON'T BE DIAPPOINTED."
2,Was cool for the first few months,I really liked how this looked and i ordered it because it was cheap. It went on ok on my 2007 nissan sentra but i had to super glue it and then the super glue wore off and i delt with it. I went back to the stock one because 5 out of the 7 lights went out. Only Red and Green would go and then eventually the shift knob stopped working.. i wouldnt recommend it
5,Have to see it,"I don't want to reveal anything, it's the best movie ever. It shows how the UN really acted during the war, and believe me, it's a complete truth. YOu have to see this movie. It is the best movie that I have ever seen."
3,Careful,"Though a good movie. There was nothing spectacular that grabbed me. A diffrent kind of storyline is whats good about this movie. It has a serious, yet humorous side to it. I was expecting a full blown drama. It is ok. But personally not a favorite."
4,An honest look at the Bosnian war,"This movie is interestsing in a quirky way, subtitles and all. It points out how insane war between neighbors can become and how useless the UN peacekeeps can be. The movie also does a good job of showing how news media get involved and can cause their own kind of problems in war zones."
4,War with no victory,"A 'futility of war' themed film which climaxes with a 'dead-end' conundrum which can transfer to many of today's conflicts and which depicts perfectly how there are no winners in war .Low budget, low level of special effects but high emotion, tension and a quality of writing that maintains interest and momentum.This isn't just any war film - it documents a lot more."
2,oh! the senselessness. oh! the humanity. oh! the trivialization.,"set against the background of the serbian-bosnian war, this reeks of a significant piece of theater masquerading as a significant piece of cinema. while a wounded soldier lies on a landmine that will go off as soon as he moves, he is argued over by both sides, UN peacekeepers, and a television news crew. a silly pretense (he simply shouldve been allowed to blow himself up) and views of the effete futility of the peacekeepers and the cynicism of the television reporters that we have seen for decades now in better written, better acted, and better directed movies. suspenseful, at least? yeh, as suspenseful as an american cheese sandwich."
5,Better than Welcome to Sarajevo,"I'm a big fan of the aforementioned film, but No Man's Land is truly incredible in how much it conveys about the Bosnia-Serbia war. Its absurdities, its tragedies, and even its tragicomic humor is all conveyed with very little artifice and incredible acting from largely unknown faces (at least in American cinema). It also strikingly humanizes and personalizes this conflict and war in general by focusing almost exclusively on two individuals, one Bosnian and one Serbian, trapped in a trench between the lines. Later, the role of the UN peacekeepers and the media is brought in with a great deal of honesty and, again, sarcastic humor at the relative impotence of both in the midst of such a complex and explosive situation.For anyone interested in both the psychological and practical implications of war, this is a film that demands to be seen."
4,Not in English!!,"The movie is very good however, it is NOT in English as advertised by Amazon. It does have English subtitles as well as Spanish and French.The audio track is in Serbo-Croatian."
5,War movie of entirely different kind!,"This is a war movie, at the same time, its very much personal film. When two soldiers of opposite camps are forced to stay in a trench - both having bullet injury - they not only confront enemy, they confront their mirror images. Both have similar mission, similar wound, similar feeling, similar frustration about the trouble they are in, again for similar reason.Through their exchange of words and thoughts the movie displays the gigantic proportion of farce that the war has reached. The lighter moments in the movie have been injected with brilliant sense of precision and wit. Interestingly, even such a prolonged session together does not help to let the very soldiers realize the futility of their hostility. Almost similar to the lack of sensitivity of the UN, as the movie showed.A funny film about war, from a very different perspective.A must watch."
3,No Man's Land CD,"Someone recommended this movie to us. It was not that great. A bit dissappointed in it. Didn't move along like we had thought. However, the product arrived in reasonable amount of time and was in good condition."
2,It didn't work,I tried several times to transfer an image to the puzzle surface and it neve did adhere. I really wanted this too.
4,Great Gift,"We purchased this item as a graduation gift for a niece. We had purchased a similar item at a craft show a number of years ago for another niece who still reminds us how much she liked the box and will always remember where it came from. We were not comfortable with the on-line option at first but when this came up we knew immediately it was what we were looking for. We were not disappointed. The workmanship is the finest, the price reasonable, and shipping immediate. We were well and truly pleased, and so was the recipient."
5,trooper down,I read this book many years ago when i got started in Law Enforcement. I recently bought another copy for my son who is now entering the field. It gives some realistic insight into the life of a Trooper and all the challenges that come with it.
3,"Interesting moments, but buy it used for less","Christian Smith has some interesting moments going on in this CD. He features tribal house in this mix that's like a bellcurve: it slowly builds to a very funky intense vibe and then lets you down. After his skillful crescendo, Smith lets you down too much too soon and he stumbles noticeably on some of the mixes in the later part of the CD. Nonetheless, the CD is worth a listen if not for Smith's selection of Track 15 ""Remanipulator"" by Ben Sims. Buy it for your next house party."
4,Tonic treatment,"Dance music such as this is tonic for the grooviliciously inclined! Christian Smith, hailed by such luminaries as Richie Hawtin and Carl Cox as the next big techno DJ- lays out an ensemble of dancefloor shakers that gets to your body in no time. Smith's mix is complex and layered, with interesting variations from juicy pads, pumping tech-house, electro flavored techno, and even some tribal-techy-housey grooves. The real gem of the mix is Michel De Hey vs Grooveyard's Compound, a dancefloor filler that is so infectiously groovy, that its going to make me shake that [booty]for years to come.High recommends!"
4,"This is True ""Techno""!!!","Alright, I want to start off by giving a little bit of an ""Electronica"" lesson. It has become all to common to hear people refer to ""Electronica"" as ""Techno"". STOP!!This CD, by Christian Smith, is true ""Techno""! Everything else has it's own title (Trance, House, Booty House, Hard House, Hard Trance, Happy Hardcore, Tech-Trance, Chill-out, Gabber, and so on and so forth). Anyway, this is a very good look at what ""Techno"" has become. . .hard, heavy, uplifting, fast, and beautiful! Although this CD may be too much for some people to handle, it is still definitly underground material! Even though I'm not too fly on using three decks (that extra deck just opens most DJ up to many, many flaws and train-wrecks), Christian manipulated them perfectly! What it all comes down to is, if 'ya wanna' dance. . .now's the time!!"
3,"Give it a look,if you're a fan of low-budget American horror.","Messiah of Evil (aka Dead People, 1972)Dream-like artsy zombie nightmare! Underrated!Sisters of Death (1977)Six beautiful high school girls are involved in initiation ceremonies for their exclusive society, The Sisters.Give it a look, if you're a fan of low-budget American horror."
5,A superb and scholarly contribution to women's history.,"Women in Ancient America represents the first comprehensive coverage of women in precolumbian American cultures, describing their roles and relationships and utilizing key archaeological works to revamp traditional historical perspectives about the times. From the origins of agriculture to the development of social and religious systems, this provides many important, unique insights."
5,very touching,"This is a very touching movie about a father(Chente) struggling to get his son (Alejandro) to notice, while at the same time the mother tries to seperate them and tries to avoid contact with chente's charector. It has many tearful moments, and overall this is a true classic. I really recomend it."
4,Wonderfully moving!,"I watched this movie twice in a row and cried most of the way through it both times. I had borrowed it from a high school student in a class that I substituted, and although my Spanish isn't that good, I loved it! Too bad there isn't a soundtrack! I am a true blue Alex fan ever since I heard him sing the first note of the first song, and I was thrilled to see this movie. Although I wasn't very big on his father, after watching the movie, I am now a fan of his as well. My student recommended that I look here to buy it, because I have looked unsuccesfully in all the local stores."
2,It says English subtitles.,"I ordered this because it is supposed to have English subtitles. It does not. So I do not understand anything except that the movie looks rather amateurish, although the Fernandez guys, father and son, sing well. I bought it because I like the Alejandro voice, but sadly, this one was not possible to watch. Would not have bought it if the Amazon information on the site had been correct."
5,Great upgrade!!!,"Probably should have gotten this ext antenna back when I bought my 276c. But then I wouln't get the impression now of having somewhat upgraded my gps. It highly improved accuracy and reception. Only con is that cable looks a bit fragile, however, have abused it a bit with no sign of deterioration. Anyway, a bit more cable armoring would be desirable. Otherwise fabulous product though."
1,Just Plain Sad,"When I was about 14 or 15, I used to rent these movies, I don't know what I was thinking. I couldn't watch the parts where animals were killed. But now, I don't see how anyone could rent/buy these sick movies. And to top it off, they show the narrator or someone having their lunch while telling us what hes going to show next. All I can say is ""Please Stay Away from these sadistic tapes"""
1,TERRIBLE,The worst video's ever. Most of the films are fake and scripted. They even go as far as showing a giant mutant leech that bit a girl and ended up killing her in one video. Should have read the reviews before I wasted 62 bucks on it.
1,this should be banned PERIOD!,"it's sad to see how low some humans can go to call real death entertainment. This is the most twisted and sickest thing i have ever watched, the person or people who put this trash togehther should be killed. Im still shocked till this day that people acually buy this, i feel nothing but pain for the animals who were killed in this, it really makes me sick that people find this funny. WHY IS AMAZON SELLING THIS? THIS SERIES SHOULD BE BURNED AND DESTROYED, this is another great example of how sick and degraded humans have become."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I saw this ""Faces of Death"" series a short while ago and I can't even believe that some people class it as ""horror""!To me, it came across as a documentary style series with some doctor narrating about various methods of animal slaughter and tragic human deaths...To be honest, I found a lot of it rather boring and the film didn't really cover anything that I hadn't seen before - except perhaps, the monkey delicacy, where the animal's brain is bashed in.I then read the previous reviews and found that most people have said that it's fake! Maybe I'm a bit gormless as I thought they looked real enough! Haha, never mind.Pretty much a big fuss over nothing and a waste of money, if you ask me. Spend your money on something more interesting!"
1,Pure Crap.,"The only reason why these videos ever made cult status is because people are incredibly gullible... even in the face of terrible ""special"" FX. Rent it if you must see it, but don't waste your money... unless you want to add it to your collection of useless crap."
2,King Isham,"You can look at it all real close and notice all the suck that was put into it..... Try Traces Of Death, dont waste your money like i did."
2,Faces of Death Collection (Vols. 1-4,So many people have written this and it is very true. These videos seemed so scarey and horrible when I first saw them years ago. Now I am so much more able to see how phoney most of this is.
2,Most of the footage was faked.,"Heres some old news for those who do not know: many of the death scenes in the FOD series were faked.The original director, John Schwartz, admits to faking much of the footage (search google for ""Lifting the mask from faces of death"").Also, a discerning eye and some quality video editing software is enough to disprove much of the footage as being fake.So what is real? According to the director, the animals being slaughtered, the autopsy footage and around 20% of the death footage from Faces of Death is actually real.My advice? If your interested in this kind of thing than take a pass on Faces of Death and go to Ogrish-dot-com or find the recent fan-made ""Real Faces of Death"" compilation which contains almost every clip Ogrish has published (92-minutes, look on P2P, about 730MB)."
3,Not too gory for the Army,I watched this collection in the barracks while I was in the Army while eating honey nut cheerios. Its hard to believe that as a hard core horror/gore fanatic that I did it now. I thought it was fascinating and gross at the same time. I love biographies and documentaries and liked the way it was presented. Not for people with weak stomachs.
2,Too Tame,"Faces of Death Collection (Vols. 1-4)was (for me at least) a complete snooze-fest. Perhaps it would have had greater impact if I'd seen it 20 years ago, when my world-innocence was intact and I hadn't yet experienced the horrors that was to become my real life. Now, 20 years later after going through years of abuse, rape, torture, and other humiliations, horror movies pale in comparison. Sure it has plenty of gore and mutilations and whatnot, but, in a generation based on CSI and Quentin Terentino, so does everything else we watch or go see. So my review is save your money for the movies, this was snore-iffic."
1,Appauling,I find this highly distrubing that a dvd can be found on the internet like this. I can understand DVDs like this being sold on the black market but should kept there. not on some auction site where there is a review for 13 year olds to fill out.This film shows extremely damaging graphics of death. For an illegal film this is shocking to see it is on your auction site.Disgusted in Australia
2,Mostly fake garbage. A few real stuff thrown in.,"I viewed the original many years ago when it was 1st released on VHS. Slaughter house footage. Cremations. Some other odds and ends were interesting to watch. I later saw the follow on. The scenes were more close in on people. The scenes were bloodier and more disturbing. I later went back and watched many of the ""disturbing"" scenes and began to find inconsistencies and telltale clues that led me to believe most if not all the scenes were fake. After that I happily never watched another episode again."
1,Not For All The Tea In China,This movie and its variants are nothing more than a shovel full of slop for empty heads. From the sewer it came and in the sewer it should have stayed.
1,Pointless.,"I'm sure some people will *love* this. The people who enjoy things like this are bored thill-seekers, desensitised to everything, with very little life-experience. They have no idea what real death is (particularly violent death), and the impact it has on the people who are left behind. People who enjoy this kind of thing who *have* had experience of death first-hand probably have some fairly serious problems and should seek help."
3,"Soft new age-style music , lots and lots of water!","Nice and peaceful soft cuts here, nearly every song has water and geese noise. IT says 'Authentic field recording enhanced with theater surround sound', however, I am convinced someone was playing with the bathwater a little too much. At the end I literally got drowned by a wave. Remember that shop in the mall? late 80's/early 90's, think 'The Nature Store', this would have been playing there."
4,Very Smooth!,"This stroller was well worth the money, it is very smooth and unlike other strollers with the front wheel this one was very well put together. My wife and I jog with it and our two kids 3yr and 5yr are very comfortable in it. The materials used are high grade and with some care will last a long time I'm sure. One of the selling points was it being made by Schwinn, we have Schwinn bikes in the family and this was just another good investment.Bottom line is we are very pleased with this item."
3,Reurned Stroller b/c of MAJOR DEFECT,"The stroller was great, except for the fact that the break kept rubbing on the wheel, no matter what we did. We finally just returned it."
4,Easy to use. Fits my 5 and 2 year old well.,"I bought this hoping that my 5 year old would be comfortable enough in it. He is 42 inches and about 37 pounds. He prefers to sit forward and hold the bar in front of him rather than lay back. The seat back is a little short for him, but he says that he is comfortable. Both seats recline completely. It is a little difficult to access the storage compartment under the seats. One handed steering and collaspe is easy to use. Storage in my SUV is fine, it is larger than expected. I bet it would be difficult to fit this into a car trunk.Overall I am happy with my purchase."
1,Poor packaging,This item came through on some of the paperwork as a bike but is actually a Schwinn double jogging stroller. We ordered it twice but the packaging was so poor both the strollers were broken upon arrival. There was no packing material and the box construction was poor (not enough glue to hold it together.) The hinges where the canopy attaches to the stroller rubbed right through the box and and in each case one side was broken. Too bad. It otherwise seemed like a nice item at a good price.
1,Low quality,This robe is the first I have ever owned with see-through terry cloth. I bought another from another maker for $20 less that is far better.
3,"""Special Needs"" for ""Special People""","The book is obviously a poke at the whole 'politally correct' movement which doesn't seem to have any proponants who will stand up and take credit for having started it. That being said, it's an entertaining read with plenty of laughs, but it's getting to be a bit cliche. Another comment I read said that it's a good book for someone with, get this, 'special needs'. I wonder if they meant what I think? Well, when I was a kid (not a young goat) we just called 'intellectually disadvantaged' people 'special'. Actually the 'R' word, but I won't go there. In my humble opinion, there seems to be a hidden agenda and or ideology in all the popular issues being debated or joked about these days. Many argue about what it's all about. I read that it is coming down to 'what' and 'how' we should teach our children in high schools and universities. Be careful what you read! The pen (now a PC with a word processor) is mightier than the sword."
3,An Average-Challenged Parody for the Millenium,"Beard and Cerf's spoof on political correctness was quite amusing when first published, but as with many things with topical humor: you had to be there. This is not to say that this book is not a great gift idea for that special someone that you know who was (was not) there and didn't (doesn't)""get it."" Political correctness is still alive and well, but like new shoes the concept is becoming more comfortable in our lives. P.C. -- not to be confused with PCs that people embraced at a much faster rate -- still pinches our toes in places. So first time managers of people may appreciate receiving this little tongue-in-cheek guidebook on the complexities of workplace diversity to gain perspective of the times. For the price, this irreverent reference piece by Beard and Cerf is a humorous ""hard back disadvantaged"" book for those with special needs."
3,Fun . . . until it breaks,"My son is robot obsessed and has five of these robots in different colors. He loves playing with them and carries them everywhere we go. But they break easy. Most of them no longer will walk. You can tell whatever gears are inside are trying to turn, but they just don't get the job done anymore. On two of them they quit walking within a week of purchase. Oh, and you can buy them at Wal Mart for $4.88."
5,I might get this item,I asked my grandpa if I get this for Christmas I am very happy.I wont this it is a great source to read about kid tips.
3,Up and downs of Descalzi,"I bought this book out of curiosity after hearing and learning that Guillermo Descalzi was living as a homeless person in Washington DC, but unfortunately this book is more about Guillermo's carreer as a TV Journalist, the world events he covered while working for SIN and Telemundo and his personal view about where God should be in our life. I did not particular enjoy the last section of the book where he goes into an extensive explanation of the relationship between God and Man and the way how he feels a person should live in relation to God.I was hoping to get more of an insight of his experiences while he was living as a drug addict and homeless person and how he was able to overcome his addiction.This book is Okay if you are interested in learning the world events and the person Descalsi interviewed and his personal opinion about religion."
4,Great Conductor Of the Past,"This is a great,inexpensive compilation of most of the known recordings of the famous Dutch conductor, Willem Mengelgerg while he was conductor of the famed Amsterdam Conceretgebouw Orchestra. For a [small price] per CD you are getting a great window into the past when orchestral conducting was much more of a personal issue.Mengelberg conducted the ACO from 1895-1945. He was personal friends with Mahler and Straus. Strauss's ""Ein Heldenlem"" was dedicated to Mengelberg and the ACO. Meglelberg's style of conducting was quite wayward by todays stadards...lots or use of added vibrato, and portomento and the tempei could vary trmendously within the dame piece. For the Tcaikovsky, Straus, Schubert, Brahms, Weber,Liszt it could be quite thrilling. For the classics like Beethoven and Mozart and Bach, it could quite disturbing to say the least. Some great and not so great here...."
1,Poorly written,The author really means well and has a good message but the book is so poorly written you will end up on the floor with seizures after a few pages. Unfortunate.
4,Concise and self-reflecting,"Society commonly neglects to appreciate the little things. Many able-bodied people lack the drive, motivation and determination to change their paradigm. John Paul Carinci puts things in perspective and provides an uplifting message."
5,A wonderful and uplifting read!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. It was uplifting and inspiring. John Paul Carinci is a true success story. This book will push you to be your best with a lot of practical tools for mind, body, and spirit."
5,A MUST read if you want to be successful,"Over the years I have read many ""self-help"" books, which all say the same thing. This is the first book that I have read that makes sense and offers some good ""tools"" to set you aside from others and make you different ~~ a WINNER!!The key is to take what is in the book and make it work for you. No, it is not easy; however, it is possible.You MUST have the ""power to believe"" in yourself and REALLY want to make a difference. Each one of us has our own path and must follow it, with a ""positive"" attitude. The real World is full of ""negativity"" and it is up to you to change your ""negative"" thoughts into ""positive"" thoughts.I highly recommend this book!! Read it.. and use it, if you want to make a difference in your life."
5,Surprised this is free,"Awesome, inspiring book. I recommend for those who want to get the most out of life. This is an excellent read."
1,Buy plenty of tape.,"I got these at a good price and they're perfect for mailing cds, however the adhesive used to seal them is woefully inferior. AND THIS IS A SCOTCH 3M PRODUCT!!! Isn't that what they do?"
5,Love these Mailers,"I love these because they really protect the things I'm mailing, they aren't prohibative in price and sometimes they are on sale"
4,Good sturdy mailers,"I bought these to send some Christmas gifts (small chocolates) overseas. They're a very good size to include a card and a small gift, and are simple and easy to use. They have a self-adhesive flap, and nice lines to write addresses on. I'm glad I stocked up on these."
5,Item is great,"Use these all the time for mailing, although I find mine at the local wholesale club for five bucks. These work well, could use a little better sealing but it works ok for the price I pay."
3,"DVD cases don't fit properly, good envelopes otherwise",The good: the envelopes are simple and sturdy. The adhesive is strong enough and the envelopes will stay sealed*.The bad: DVD keep cases just barely fit. You'll have to cram the case in and this will ruin some of the protective bubble wrap inside. *The adhesive doesn't cover enough of the flap to keep it from catching and possibly ripping during transit.If these were just a pinch larger in size they would be very good envelopes. I recommend Duck brand bubble mailers over these.
5,Bought as a gift.,The rating was given by the recipient of the book as a Christmas gift. It is chuck full of good information - even for those who are already familiar with genealogy.
2,Disappointed,"Obviously, the price is right -- so that's 1 star right there. And the convenience of super-saver delivery spares me I don't even know how many trips to Niger. That's another star.However, try as I might, I could never get this stuff to enrich to fully weapons-grade. If it worked half as well in my ballistic missiles as it does in my research reactor, it'd be 5 stars. Maybe you'll have better luck. It's possible that my centrifuge is hinky."
2,What is this odd substance?,"Not only was it not moist, this product wasn't even cake! Rather I found myself confronted with an odd powdery substance which had very little flavor at all, even when mixed withTuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. Fortunately through Amazon.com I can sell my slightly used copy to what will most certainly be some other very unsatisfied customer."
3,card file,"Card file was as expected. Very cheaply made, plastic is easily bent or bowed out of shaped. Latch does not hold lid closed without bending to make fit."
4,Dora the Explorer Summer Explorer,My three year old daughter loved recieving this movie she watches this one and the other two i purchased on here too. thank you so much.
5,WOW,I revived the stand in 2 days via amazons amazing FREE shipping. When i opened the package I was very surprised.For 8 bucks the quality of the stand is amazing. The package includes a high quality metal stand. The stand is a basket style not the screw on type. There is virtually no assembly. All you do is slide the top into a tube on the bottom; EASY. Overall great experience with amazon as always. I would recommend the stand to anyone you cant go wrong for 8 bucks.
5,Rehabber Loves This Heartbeat Toy for Bobcat Kittens,"One of our donors sent this heartbeat toy to us for a blind, orphaned bobcat kitten. He loves it like a sibling. After his dinner he bathes the toy and snuggles up to sleep with him. We had to order more because he just can't be a day without this toy and a new bobcat kitten we just rescued needs one too."
3,yummy soft smell,"I like this perfume. I first discovered it when it was an insert in a magazine i was reading and i fell in love with it. i purchased it on amazon and received it shortly afterward. I really like this soft, flirty smell, but i didnt get nearly as many comments/ compliments on it as i do with my regular perfumes... kind of a bummer... but i still like the fragrance...."
4,Great shirt for the price!,I've bought several smalls of this shirt and a medium. I actually prefer the medium...the small is REALLY small after washing.
5,KICKS ASS!!! ROCK MASTERPIECE!!!!,"This is the best of Dr. Sin you'll gonna find here, this album rocks HARD!!! It's the same release that calls Brutal in Brazil, but with tracks in a different arrange. I strongly recommend that any people who really enjoy rock music and people who thinks there's no more good rock'n'roll bands today, go for this album! You'll thank me later! The best brazillian rock band I've ever seen! Songs like Isolated, Silent Scream, Down In The Trenches, Fire, Child Of Sin, War, Someone To Blame, are included in my list of my all time favorite rock songs! Childrens of sin, let's rock!!!"
1,worst book I have ever read,"I must admit, this is truly the worst book that I have ever seen published (how this happened I can't imagine, except self-publishing) and the worst book that I have attempted to read. I have to say there was some skimming, as the book was so trashy and poorly written, it didn't even deserve my full concentration. To have put ones name to this worthless mess, took some nerve.The man who wrote this, has a true disregard and dislike for women....this is apparent. Why he bothered to think that anyone would find the topic or his degrading attitude toward one of the lead characters interesting, is sheer vanity on this his part. I guess all we can hope for in the future is that this guy give up writing for some other type of hobby.....the worst, book ever written."
1,FRAUDE PRESENTADO COMO REALIDAD,"Si la obra fuera presentada como ficcion pasaria, pero el autor jura y jura de nuevo que el ha recibido esos documentos atestiguando hechos no comprobados por nadie mas ni del mundo cientifico-milital ni civil de ningun tipo. Tuve la dicha de leer los primeros 4 Caballo de Troya gracias a un hermano que me los presto, por tanto tuve tambien la dicha de descubrir las inconsistencias e incongruencias que de haberlos leido con la distancia en el tiempo por publicacion no hubiera logrado. Me molesta mucho la deshonestidad por unos dolares mas, el mundo cristiano deberia saber que juega con sus sentimientos religiosos para lograr mas lectores (mas dinero en su bolsillo)"
3,A book to be studied.,Well organized but written in a professorial style that often uses stilted language that obscures and fails to keep the reader's interest.
5,Cry of the Curlew - Fantastic,Loved this book and am busy reading the whole lot from the series. Masterful intergration of fictional characters with real historic people and events. Wonderful the way that Peter Watt can remember all his characters and the relationship he has with them all is exceptional. Fabulous book and was very difficult to put down.
1,Hose popped right off when tugged on just a little,I returned this item because the drain tube popped right off when the tube was stretched to reach the drainage point. Luckily nothing was in the tube at the time.
3,Not bad,"West of Rome is truly not bad at their forte; that is, playing pretty good country/folk/rock music. Songs like ""Not Supposed To,"" the opening track, and ""American Folk Music"" take off because the band can play, period. Think, if you will, Ryan Adams with more singers.However, there's some bad stuff here-why go to grunge on ""Meet Me Yesterday?"" Grunge is deader than dead, and they bring it up. ""The Ballad of Abbie Merrill"" is a truly intolerable ballad that is extrememly difficult to sit through-whether it's the bad lyrics, strained voice, or the fact that the song's around six minutes.However, it's worth it all just to hear a cover of Dwight Twiley's (later Bruce Springsteen's) ""I'm On Fire."" It's rare when a band does a song better than the Boss, but it happens here.Yes, West of Rome is working hard-and they will improve. They have the formula right; they just need to use it."
1,awlful!!!,WOW. I can't believe this movie is so bad! Waste time and money. I will see it Real Cheap.
5,Durable and They Look Nice,"I've had a set of these for several years now mixed in with all of the mismatched coffee cups/mugs that have accumulated in the cabinet over the years. These are always the ones I grab for first. I think they have a very classic modern style - Not too heavy, not too dainty, with a slightly taller, slightly narrower profile. They feel nice in your hand. I am no expert on porcelain, but the quality on these seems very good. None of these cups have broken or even chipped and as I stated, I've had them for several years and use them daily. You're probably not going to bust out these mugs when the Queen of England comes to visit, but as a set of coffee mugs for everyday use, I think these are better than average. I recommend them."
5,Coffee Cups that REALLY LAST.,"I LOVE these mugs.This company has the best options for the coffee or tea drinker.All my other mugs break and chip, but since I switched to this company 3 years ago, I've been very pleased.I have started a collection of the different sizes. These are slightly on the medium size, and I do prefer the larger ones. They are just the right size for a ""I don't have to work, go to class, or anything that requires thought"" kind of day.BUY THESE MUGS AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY."
4,Beautiful Cups and a Perfect Size... BUT,"The handle fell off of the one cup and now I cannot get it replaced. This is very sad... Hey, the cups are a great thing though, and my one mug could just be a fluke? Who knows?If they become available again, I will buy up about 14 cups. So, I'd say the one handle did not take away from the cup's overall perfection - for me."
3,Too rushed...not for beginners,Programs were too quick based on classes I'd taken. Went back to going to class. Bummer. May be good for others more experienced.
4,surprisingly excellent novelization,"I usually don't bother with novelizations, as they are, by nature, little more than movie transcripts. But Greg Cox has taken a screenplay and turned it into a full-fledged novel. This isn't a classic for the ages, but Cox's ""Underworld"" is as good as the best high-end paperback original vampire novels. The writing is crisp and moves things along at a fast pace, filling in details without being obtrusive. Not having seen the movie yet, I can't vouch for it's quality; however, if you are a fan of vampire fiction, then I highly recommend checking out this novel."
1,Yawn,I haven't seen the film but there's still not much to like about the book. It's full of lame cliches and silly (without being entertaining) fight scenes.
5,COX'S UNDERWORLD WAS EYE-OPENING!!,"Greg Cox's writing is perfect for this genre. I saw the movie and loved it, but Cox's details and storytelling was grafted on with a superb touch.The movie - though highly entertaining and visually stimulating - left me a little confused about some things.The book version cleared all that up.I for one will be buying the next exciting romp in this series. I also will see the sequel.If you are looking for an exciting read - this is it!"
3,more movie please,"I saw the movie...twice. I'm waiting patiently for the dvd. I read the other reviews and bought the book. _not_ as good as the movie. The charater development was completely different and while I got a sence of what got cut from the screenplay I have to say the movie is better for it.I did have a problem when Selene-the centuries old werewolf hunter, pauses in the middle of the hunt to oggle an attractive human. My take on the moment from the movie was that she regretted involving an ""innocent"" in the war but was still determined to track her prey.If you were disapointed in the lack of romance in the movie you can find it here but the characters suffer for it.additionally while reading I felt that the author had cracked open his dictonary for as many $5 words as he could find.this isn't a bad book but for vampire fiction it's not deathless prose. Still it helps me fight off the craving to go see the movie in the theaters yet again."
2,could've been better,"It was hard for me to get going in this book. And a lil difficult to keep up with. The drawn out actions scenes kinda lost me. But I was glad I read it before I saw the movie. It helped me to understand the movie better, and have a better feel for what was going on. But I have to honestly say that I didn't really enjoy reading this book as compared to other paranormal stories."
2,New??? HA pull the other one,"I bought this book which was listed as new. It is priced ridiculously high because it is no longer produced. When the book arrived it looked like any other second-hand book. In my opinion, you are definitely better off buying the second hand books - that's what you get anyway and it is a heck of a lot cheaper!"
2,"If you've seen the movie, you'll be disappointed","I absolutely loved this movie and was looking forward to reading the book, but it was a big disappointment. All the beauty and mystery built up in the cinematography of the film and the restrained behavior of the characters is lost in this book. Selene ogles Michael. There are way too many descriptions of how cool her car is. And there isn't enough added beyond the basic movie plot to make the book worth reading -- what little extra character development is done in the book is mostly trite and cliched. (Spoiler alert!!) Michael even has the obligatory ""I became a doctor because the woman I loved died in car wreck and I couldn't save her!"" subplot, which is so cliched it's not to be believed. Save your time and money for repeated viewings of the DVD, and cross your fingers that if a second novelization comes out it's written by someone else."
4,Brilliant but brief overview of bygone symbols,"A terrific overview of trademarks, this remarkable book break symbols down into sections - corporate america, typography, etc - that make the book easily digestable. Great as inspiration for graphic designers, as source material, or as one of my friends recently did, ideas for tattoos. Good stuff."
3,"Lotsa Fun, and Informative.","So far, the biggest kick I got out of this book was seeing the trademark for National Airlines. I remember when the only air service we got here in little Sarasota was from Eastern, National, and Florida Airlines, none of which are in existence any more. This book shows you how a symbol can be ubiquitous and then vanish."
3,Update on the Decison Tools Suite,"Dr Clemen has provided an excellent text for Decision Analysis instruction. I have continuously surveyed the field and have yet to find a text that comes up to the standard that Dr Clemen set with his first publication ""Making Hard Decisions""I have used ""Making Hard Decisions with Decision Tools Suite"" as well as the predecessor text ""Making Hard Decisions.""Richard D Hofler"
2,Wanted to like this,"Love stories set in Louisiana but just couldn't get into this. Very slow start, couldn't keep my attention, may pick it up again later"
1,Content error,There was a major error with this e-book it is Louisiana Big Shot instead of Louisiana Lament. I don't konw how to get the book I really ordered
4,A good read,"If you have enjoyed any of the other Talba Wallis novels, then you will enjoy this one at least as much, and maybe more because her character continues to grow. If you have read and enjoyed the Skip Langdon series, but not Talba Wallis, you are in for a treat because this is an even more fleshed out persona. I would suggest however, that you read the Skip Langdon novel ""82 Desire"" which introduces Talba first, and then the other Talba Wallis novels in order so that you can enjoy the character's evolution."
2,lost vision,Vision of Disorder has sharply departed from thier hardcore roots and is flexing thier artistic muscles on this record. Although many fans enjoyed the energy and aggression of previous albums the band thinks thier old style was worn out and while once revolutionary is now stale. They have produced an album while ear friendly is lacking in energy and insite.
5,definitely their best cd...,"this cd is amazing! it's filled with powerful grooves and riffs that will knock you down. the vocals are great too...perfect mixture of singing/screaming.their other cds are great, especially their self-titled, but this cd tops them all. it's vod progressing to yet again another level. all the power to 'em.PICK UP THIS ALBUM!!"
3,You'll want to skip some selections,"It's a well-recorded great sounding organ and Mr. Neil plays superbly; most selections are well done and enjoyable.One selection is a very grating warbly soprano vocal. The first track is one of those ""world premiere recordings""; the debut should have been delayed indefinitely.This CD has some excellent selections but you won't want to listen to every track."
5,Great Gift,I got this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loved it. Great purchase. I was very pleased with the product.
3,Good and bad.,"I purchased this lighter for my step-father. It arrived within the suggested estimated arrival date period. The lighter is awesome, but there are a few things that I don't like about it -- The background scene is a little worn on the lighter, so the detailing on the lines in the road and the texture of the trees is very faded. Also, the top when opened is very loose and probably wont last very long unless used with caution. Also, it does not include the lighter fluid and was pretty dirty when it arrived -I had to wipe it off real good. Overall, the product is still nice, but I do not know that I would buy from this seller again."
3,one was wrong!!!,one of the flags was missing the stars..the other two were fine. i didn't pay for the new flag; i paid for the old one!! other than that everything was good.
2,discs stopped spinning,"I recieved this as a gift for my 18 month old. After about a month, the discs stopped spinning. Has not been touched since."
2,Disappointingly short lifespan,"My 18 month old daughter received this toy as a holiday gift (2004) and immediately loved it. But after only one month of use, the discs stopped spinning- presumably due to some hard play/ her pushing down on the discs with her hands. As this toy is made for children her age, I expected better durability. It is disappointing, and she now ignores it because the only remaining working feature is the slide."
3,Not much to it,This toy is cute but there isn't much room for imagination. My kids love to push the button and watch things spin around but that is all they get out of it. The rooms/stores are not big enough to play in. I'd go with Little People instead.
5,I love it! My son does too!,"We just got this for my son's first birthday, and we love it! It is so cute and unlike many baby toys, I don't find it annoying! The music is catchy and not too loud. This toy is great! :)"
2,Fall's Apart,"I got this for my son at Christmas, and it was left in the box until a few month later(he is now 16 months old). He loves making the disc spin, but he's figured out that you can actually pull the town out of the base, and everything else that snapped into place. He loves this toy, but he loves to take it apart more."
5,Great rendition,"I dont know what the other reviewer is talking about. I got the first issue on free comic book day. If you dont know what that is, well its what it sounds like and a great way to see some great stuff out there. I liked the artwork and was interested to see how the story fleshed out. So I was thereat the comic shop each time the next issue came out and each time I was treated to beautiful cover art and more story. When this collection of all the issues came out I picked it up right away. Even got to meet the writer and on of the artists at comic con who gladly signed it for me. The art is great and its a great story. I recommend this book for anyone who likes westerns and great art in comics."
2,Product could be improved,Front of package does not tell you it containes only 10 sheets to work with. For the price I was very dissapointed.
3,Old photos of battlefield,Generally what I expected and interesting to review the old photos enclosed. I would recommend this to any civil war buff.
5,Gettysburg : Then and Now,This is a great book to have if you are interested in Gettysburg or the Civil War.
1,The Last Mile,"There is nothing to review. In watching the trailer to see if you are interested further, time is up due to the long list of credits. You have 04 seconds of the movie. What I did see, however, the film quality is poor."
2,Half baked,"This book could have been so much better. The romance between Kaylee and Cutler was hot, but everything else was not. There were three or four different suspense side plots which were half baked. Had they been fully developed, the book would have been a humdinger, and worthy of 5 stars. The ending was really rushed to wrap things up neatly. It may have been a better idea to only partially wrap things up and write a sequel. But that's just my personal opinion."
2,Cheap thrills,"I found this novel to be gratuitously graphic. Remember when an author allowed for a little sexual tension which kept you reading? Well there was none of that here because no lust went unsatisfied with our hero and heroine, and frankly it became boring in addition to being graphic.I was also disappointed in the trite and repetitive dialogue and the lack of character development in Cutler Mcfarland. Wouldn't you have expected our hero to at least wrestle with the possibility of not revealing what he new about his paternity to his devoted mother and the man who raised him and was the only 'father' he ever knew. It seemed that he blasted ahead, satisfying his own curiosity regardless of the impact on his 'parents'. This is not what I would have expected in a hero that is otherwise presented as a man of character.My sisters and I have a book club and this was chosen, and for that reason alone, I finished reading Evening Hours."
3,A decent read but nothing special,"I usually like the types of books that have a bit of suspense along with the romance and this one didn't. Although the characters were likeable and their romance sweet, I felt like the author had too many subplots going on at once and not enough detail about what was going on outside of their personal lives. They both had a lot going on at work but it really wasn't explored. Instead most of the focus was on the main characters and somewhat on the families. It just left too much to the imagination. Still, if you're interested in pure sweet romance with intriguing characters this would be a great read for you."
4,Very Good but not for beginners,"This is a very good video but definitely not for the beginner level. I got this one and the Yoga zone for Flexibility and Stress Release. I can't get through the whole tape without a break. The DVD says it's for all levels and they offer modified poses, but it definitely gets your heart rate up. The Flexibility and Stress Release tape said it was for intermediate levels on the box and it is very manageable. This tape will definitely give me a goal to work towards."
4,#1 Yoga Video For All Levels,"Wow.. this Yoga Zone DVD is one of the best I've tried. I'd consider myself an intermediate yoga student and I had a tough time with some of the balancing postures. Most of the poses are very common and there are two other instructors in the video who move at a different paces. Once you have done the postures, the instructor brings them all together into one movement. It's very invigorating. At the end, you move into Relaxation pose and you feel amazing. It's a fantastic video for all levels."
3,Just O.K.,"Since I have taken classes at Yoga Zone here in Brookville, which are wonderful, I thought how bad could a DVD be from them? Well, it was just O.K. I think that Rodney Yee and Barron Baptiste DVD's have much more to offer. It is too hard for a true beginner like my husband, and too slow for someone with over a year experience like me. There was too much explaining between poses. I guess, I just didn't like the format. The DVD might be good for some one who has been taking beginner classes and wants to do some daily yoga pracitce."
3,You should already know yoga!,"You will not like this video unless you have taken some yoga classes already. I felt a little mislead by the review when I watched this the first time. You should know the 2 basic asanas pretty well before embarking on this very strenuous workout. I would classify this in a more advanced yoga category, as the lady talking does not clarify what exactly it is that you are doing in a beginner's fashion. But overall you will sweat and work your body."
3,Not Engaging,"I bought this based on the good reviews. I actually bought the 3 pack but mainly to get this DVD. Turns out of the three I like this one the least. Like other reviewers said, I found it repetitious and awkward at times. It just didn't flow for me and I learned nothing new. It was nothing special. I prefer Rodney, Baron, Desi and Tara."
3,Nice for a workout .... but boring,"I decided to buy this after I read so many good reviews about it,well the good news are : this is definitely a challenging yoga workout that is really good for leg and butt toning , the insructor is also very nice and has good instructions and pointers , also the outdoors set is really nice.the bad news are: this is a very dull and repetitive practice , like other reviewers have mentioned. The workout is about 60 minutes , 45 minutes are standing poses vinyasa series like doing b sun salutations for the whole time just with different poses from time to time. every series of standing postures (there's 2) is performed entirely on one side and only after you worked the hell out of one leg you switch to the other one, it ends with only a few stretches (unfortunately) on the floor and bridge pose and then savasana. also the video quality is a little bad.now it's up to you to decide if this is the kind of yoga workout you are looking for, I find this one too boring."
3,Good Workout -- Definitely NOT for beginners!,"I agree with the reviewers who said this is not for beginners. I consider myself a low-intermediate, and I could only do about 3/4 of this program. This is an excellent workout for those who want a challenge. (Alan Finger promised an athletic workout, and this certainly is that!)I do have one big problem with it, though. Lisa spends a LOT of time on one side of the body before moving onto the other side. You might do 10 Warrior I's and II's with one leg, before moving onto the other. The problem with this is that if you can't do the entire thing, you get an uneven workout. Either that, or you have to keep track of how many times you do the pose on each side. I think that many people will be unable to complete the entire workout at first, so this is a big flaw, in my mind. Why not alternate from one leg to the other?!"
5,Fact: I love this game!,"If you are looking for a great game to play as a group, then this is the game for you! Having Howie as the host is an added treat, as you try to answer numerous questions correctly before the time runs out. The bigger the group, the more fun you will have. If you love trivia games, then give this a try."
2,Fact or Crap,I purchased this for an ederly community. The questions were not appropriate for this age group.
1,Annoying host makes me hate game,"I bought this thinking it would be as fun as the board game. Turns out, Howie Mandel constantly gets on your nerves with sarcastic, condescending insults whenever you get an answer wrong...or when he's letting you know it's another person turn to play. We're not tenderhearted people and we hated Howie's character after only a few minutes...and it just got worse. Granted, if you get a lot of questions right, he's not as insulting, but he's still annoying. It's a shame, since I tend to like Howie Mandel. I don't know what they were thinking on this one. I recommend sticking with the board game."
4,The cats like it =),"I bought two of these, one for a box in the garage and the other outside in the cat house (small dog house)The two strays I'm feeding outside sleep on the warmers and seem to be doing quite well this winter. I stillbring them into the basement when it is below freezing but the rest of the time, the warmers seem towork great for them. I may buy more for my indoor pets, especially my elderly cat."
4,Cats love it,"I have ordered 2 of these now and make fleece pillow cases to go on them and the cats love the warmth, especially my 2 Senior cats. My only complaint is that they are folded up and stiffer than a board when you get them and it takes a long time for them to flatten out. It is a shame they couldn't be a little more flexiable and therefore more comfortable. I have 2 large baskets that I line with a furry fleece throw and then put the pillow case on this and lie it in the basket. Perhaps they could think of a better way to package them so they are not all folded up."
4,Does the job!!!,I purchased this because my boxer was freezing in our bedroom at night. I'd wake up and she was curled into such a tight ball on her bed I was almost afraid that she would hurt herself. I received this and put it under her bed and now she sleeps all stretched out sometimes. I really think she appreciates it because she really hates the cold. I wouldn't recommend leaving it on all the time as it does seem to get pretty hot. I have it plugged into a powerstrip and just flip it off in the morning and turn it back on at night.
3,worked better than I planned,I purchased this for my dog because my bedroom floor is cold at night. well the dog now sleeps with me and the two cats share it on the floor so It works great.
1,Waste of time,"By the time this heats whatever you cover it with, even a minimal cover, the temp is so low the cats are NOT interested. All three of my cats, especially the arthritic one, vote NO!Returning and suggesting you find alternatives. I bought a heated throw (not recommended for cats but who has heard of an old cat chewing a blanket?) for the same price as this and now have a VERY happy cat."
4,Works as advertised. See update.,My husband keeps our home cool year round. I use heating pads & blankets. To be humane I decided my cat needed a way to stay warm too. So far this pet bed warmer is working perfectly.Update- I ordered a second pet bed warmer for the other end of the house. It is a rectanguler one fom Petmate. The electrical cord is much more flexible making it easier to hide from cats who like to chew as well as easier for the owner to position in the cat bed. For this reason the Petmate scored five stars from me while this one gets four stars. Both pet bed warmers keep my cat happy.
4,Our Dogs Love These,We bought two of these; one for each dog's bed. Both dogs love them. They sleep the entire night through without moving. We were afraid they would get too hot but they don't. They are warm to the touch and are enough to keep our little boys warm. I wished we bought these a long time ago. They get
1,The Burning Bed,"I purchased this give my dog some warmth at night during the winter. She sleeps in a crate and I placed it under the crate pad but it was much too hot. So I put a pillow and a towel under the pad to add additional layers. The pad was still burning hot but the layers kept it from burning her. I was really concerned about the heat this pad put out. So I checked and the heat was going straight through to the bottom of the crate and warped it. Even the carpet underneath was burning hot through the crate, a towel, pillow and the bed pad. I was so worried that it would catch all that fabric on fire that I stopped using it. It's interesting to read that so many people have found that theirs didn't get warm enough. I wish I had that problem. Also, the company states that you can leave it on all the time and it regulates itself. I forgot to unplug it one morning and the whole thing was shockingly hot. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Heated pet bed warmer,"Pet Bed Warmer Small 4 Watts - 8.5"" x 9.5""My cat loves it. When used continuously during cold climate, it last only about a year. I have purchased two within the last two years. The price is right."
3,worked well for a year,"This pad worked very well for one winter, but was dead when I went to use it the second winter."
3,"OK, but last only 1-2 years.",These are perfect for low wattage low heat in a protected thin fleece cover. But I was disappointed that they only last about a year. I do not like disposable products and will not buy again.
2,We all want to like it....but....,"I don't know why, but we are having the opposite problem with using this product from other folks. No matter how many layers I put below and above it, it is just too hot for our cats to enjoy.I bought this for our 18+ year-old cat and she tried laying on it a few times but she can only stay on it for 10-15 minutes and then has to leave because it is too hot. We have 3 other cats and at least one of them has also tried using it with the same result.I contacted K&H; and they suggested adding more padding, which I did. I can't seem to get enough padding added to cut back on the heat. And I worry about the build-up of heat underneath the unit because it's almost too hot to touch.I've purchased K&H; products in the past and have been very happy with them. Not sure why this one is not working out for us."
4,Great for those pampered little pals in your life,"I ordered two of these little heaters for my cats and they love them !They do seem to get quite warm at times and the cats have to get out of the bed to cool off, so I find it's best to fold a baby blanket and place it in the bed over the pad to limit amount of direct exposure. I don't have to guess where the little furballs are located on a cold winter's day. I know that I'll find them in their beds all cozy and toasty."
2,Bed warmer,"I am afraid my cat doesn't seem to like it. It arrived all scrunched up in a tight bundle and seems very lumpy. Temperature-wise I am sure it's fine, however, perhaps he is ""The Prince and the Pea"" because when it's on his Sleeping place (under several layers of blanket) he's not comfortable and stays away. When he realizes it's removed, he goes back.I'm disappointed because his 18 year-old bones should love the warmth. It the texture, not the funtion that gives it a low rating in my mind."
2,K&H Pet bed warmer,The heating element stopped working at the proper level after about two weeks! It went down to barely warm and part of it didn't work at all! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
3,warm but not wht i was expecting,"kind of disappointed with this product, the large is actually quite small and it sure doesnt seem to get up to a heat setting of 110 or so that it claims to; seems more in the 70ish range, maybe. the warmer cost 31 bucks (not including the additional pouch that is to be purchased with it) and i seen a nice heated blanket at walmart which only cost 25 with more heat settings, i think i should have went that route and will prob end up buying that in the long run as i dont think this will suffice the harsh winter month's in tx. lol"
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"I wanted something to put in my dog's house outside to keep her warmer in the winter. This doesn't get as warm as I expected it would & I may resort to just getting a regular heating pad. However, if it were for use indoors, I can see that it may get warm enough (especially for arthritic pets)."
2,Returned,Amazon info was deceiving. Specs were not fully specified. What I recieved was not the same as what the picture showed. Sent it back an ordered elsewhere.
5,Love this,This product makes mornings bearable for my 15 year old cat. He loves sleeping on his heated bed.
5,Kitty LOVES It,"I have a senior kitty cat and I bought this for him to get some extra warmth for his old bones and joints. I messed up at first and tried to put it in the pet bed with a blanket. It was bumpy cuz it didn't lay flat in the bed and he didn't like that and wouldn't go near the bed while it was in there. So I tried again by folding it up in a blanket and laying that on the end of the couch where he often lays. Since it was flat, he started laying on it. Now I can't get him off the thing. He LOVES it. Totally worth the $20 to keep the old boy happy and warm. I am now considering getting one for the dog."
4,Works Well,It took a few days initially to get my 8 yr. old Lab adjusted to the new feel & sound of this pad inside the cover of her dog bed but now she enjoys sleeping on it all night. It's a winner with just the right warmth using low wattage. There's no on/off switch which prevents me from rating it 5 stars. But using this warmer with a surge protector power strip allows you to use the switch on the power strip to turn it off without unplugging the warmer.
2,TOO HOT!,"The pad we received became too hot for our dog's comfort. I am glad we placed it in her pet bed (as instructed) and not in her crate; at least she had the option of leaving her bed when it became too hot. If our pup had been in a crate where she could not leave she would have been very uncomfortable.Amazon fully refunded us for our purchase and paid return shipping since it was considered a defective item. As usual, Amazon rocks!"
3,"Works, but not my cats' favorite","My felines seem to prefer the extra heat of a human heating pad over this one. They've have the option of either for a few days now, and haven't sat on this one much. (They are fully mobile and sit where they please. I'd be more reluctant to give a less mobile, very young, elderly or ill cat a human heating pad because those are much hotter, even on the lowest setting.) So I think I'll be sending this back. It probably does just what it's supposed to, but my cats just don't appreciate it. :-)"
3,OK for a year,"The pad warmed my dog's bed just the right amount for him to accept a new bed. However, it stopped working within a year. It should be more durable."
4,So far so good,"I've had teh heater for a month now and it is working well. Our Dachsund loves the heat and will lay on it all day. Only time will tell as to how it holds up, but in the short term I'd recommend this product."
4,Can't get dog out of bed,"Our dog has 2 beds in the house. One is in a crate in our bedroom. Her crate door is always open so she can come and go as she pleases. The second is in the family room, where we spend most of our days/evenings. While she use to sleep curled all up with her feet tucked underneath her she is now all stretched out and nice and warm. She just got them for Christmas but already can tell that she won't be regifting them."
4,Dog loves his new heater,"I don't feel like this heating pad gets warm enough, but it seems well made and could withstand dog claws. I keep it wrapped in a pillow case in my dog's house. I will say this..he LOVES it! He always comes out of his house when we open the door to our deck, but after it turned cold and I put this in his house, he wouldn't budge :) He'd peek his head out of the doghouse to look at us like ""I'm not coming out of my warm hidey hole""..so 5 stars from dog, 4 from me because I wish it would get a little warmer."
3,Warmer for cat bed,Not sure yet if it will hold up for a full season. I'm hopeful that it will because my cat will not stay indoors all night and I worry that he will be too cold this winter. I'm reserving any opinion until I see how long it lasts.
5,Twenty year old kitty is thrilled with this warmer!,"I was nervous about putting an electric heater under our little old lady cat's cushion. I was afraid she might not be as aware as she should be in case it got too hot. We put this one underneath a soft thick pad (synthetic filling...very light). It's maybe 3.5 inches thick, and in order to feel the heat, you need to press lightly on the surface of the pad. We put it next to her old bed, so she can easily switch back and forth, but every time I check on her, she's happily snoozing on the warm one. I have recommended this pad to friends and family."
2,"From China, all rolled up in a little tiny box","The packaging from K&H on this small pad leaves plenty to be desired. I would think it would be shipped flat but they roll it up like a towel and expect it to unravel without any problem....it doesn't. Needless to say, mine would also not heat at all probably because one of the elements got broken as it was pressure rolled into a tiny box. I have other K&H heating pads that work fine and were packaged with respect - don't know what happened to quality control or packaging design on this one. This is K&H problem ... nothing wrong with Amazon.com, they are still the best."
2,JOHN,IT IS OKAY BUT ONLY LASTS A YEAR OR SO. THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE. K&H OR SELLER NO HELP.
5,Pet warmer,Since I have moved to a colder climate my kitties seem to search for warm spots. I purchased the small warmer which fits in the small/medium beds. It does not come with a covering so I just but a small towel around it and placed it under the covering of the bed. The cats love it. I'm planning on purchasing a large warmer to place in a large fully pillow bed later on. Highly recommend.
1,Thermostat Doesn't Work as Described,I bought this for my cat so I could turn off my mattress pad during the day or leave it on while I was out of town. The description said it had 2 thermostats and that the max temperature was 102 deg F. My cat laid on the bed (pad was placed under a quilt). After 30 minutes I found him near the window on his perch. I checked the temperature with a thermometer and found it exceeded 115 deg F; just like my regular heat pads turned on low setting. As their description says - temperatures exceeding 102 deg is unhealthy (though my cat likes it around 105). I returned it and purchased the Zilla reptile thermostat (Zilla 11939 Temperature Controller). I put this under a manual control heating pad and the thermostat turns the pad on and off as needed to keep the temp around 105 deg F. The set up worked perfectly for the 10-days I was out of town.
4,WARNING: The Large Picture is NOT correct,"The product is great, but it looks more like the other two pictures, just a plain pad 11x24 inches large. It works well and it keeps my dog in her bed at night, instead of in mine. It's a nice comforting warm, not over-powering."
5,Works and is an energy sipper,"This was installed into bedding into a dog house built for our three miniature dachsunds and they all huddle up in it and stay quite warm all year round. When it gets really cold I plug in an oil filled electric heater into the little ""closet"" I made for them but I built the dog house right by the water heater so the dogs get residual heat from one section of that which I pulled the insulation blanket away from. The thermometer I put next to their ""living quarters"" never gets below 45 even when it is -40 outside. Pretty sweet when you can keep minature dachsunds safely in the garage/basement in the worst of Western Wisconsins winters. This product feels nice and warm to the touch of the hand and the dogs sure are drawn to it. This is its first winter so how long it lasts we shall still see."
4,sannee63,"My Kitty loves this in his bed. He really needed it this year, we have had some cold days. He loves to stay in his bed and keep warm because of this heating pad. I would recommend this product for people who care about their pets well being. This is a wonderful product!"
4,very helpful,We have several older cats and already had one of these for their bed. The other two needed them too and they are very happy to have them.
3,Hmm,"I find it hard to review things that animals use exclusively. I mean I can review a cat toy based on how much they like to play with it. But a bed warmer? I don't know. This one doesn't seem to do much. I haven't curled up on it and tried to enjoy it though. We have it in an outside cat house that sits on a covered porch. This thing doesn't seem very warm when I touch it, but maybe it warms up when they are on it. They are forced to lay on it though since it covers about half of their house. So I guess it's ok?"
3,Good bed warmer - not as advertised though,"This is a pet bed warmer alright, and performs that function well. However, the picture does not match the product - what was delivered was more of a rectangle (no biggie.) In addition, there is no adjustable ""two-way"" thermostat. And also, this consumes 13 watts, not 4 watts."
1,Awful product,"This item was positively awful. It's heat output was so faint that I could only feel it by holding it to my cheek for ten seconds or so. This unit was either defective or this is just a really crappy product. I returned it right away. Seller didn't make any attempt to diagnose the problem or offer to replace what might have been a defective unit, but did accept it as a return."
3,Warm spot but...,"We ordered the warmer to help keep senior kitty a little more comfortable when main heat off. What they don't say in the description is that it is meant for their pet beds & their pet beds only. We would not have gotten it if we'd known that. It doesn't work in her bed because of the thickness of the pillow in it. We've made it work under one layer of her favorite blanket, but it's not what we were led to believe. There is no covering for the plastic pad, so it must be under something & radiate through. Wouldn't buy it again."
2,waste of money,"This bed warmer, doesn't get very warm. When I first plugged it in, it took about an hour to even heat up...my cat liked it the first couple days and now it just doesn't seem to emit a substantial amount of heat. He decided to go with his original plan...that sleeping next to my pillow/head was a better idea for him of course!"
1,Dog Hated it,"First time we tried it he took one step into his cage and backed out. Then, refused to go back in even when it was unplugged. Maybe my dog is just a wuss though."
5,homer cat,"this product is perfect for keeping pets warm in there outside homes,I was surprised as to how well it works,without using very much power.thanks Ted C"
5,K&H Pet Bed Warmer,"Great heaters for pet beds! Very satisfied; now own 6 of them. My dogs also love the warmth added to their beds by these heaters. This product came recommended to me and I, in turn, also give it my strong recommendation."
4,Cats love it,"I have bought 3 of these in the past, although they were much smaller, but by the same company. The previous ones cracked after a couple years. These appear to be a bit more flexible.The cats immediately loved both mats, which are inserted into fleece inserts I bought for the other warmers. They are on them constantly, summer and winter."
4,Great for year round,"The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because the pad stays warm at all times, and I thought it would only warm up when my dog was lying on it. This warmer has been wonderful! My dauchsund is always cold, from airconditioning in the summer, and chilly in the winter. She LOVES this heated pad!!"
1,Got way too hot,"My cat stopped using it shortly after I got it and when I checked his bed I discovered that the pad was over heating. As some reviewers noted, this pad does not get warm without some pressure on it. As others have also noted, this pad is not very reliable and can over heat. The pad is stiff, not designed for outside use and while a clever idea, lacks quality control. You can add me to the list of dissatisfied uses. Don't buy it."
3,"Bought two. One worked, one didn't",I bought two of these. One worked well but the other never warmed up to any significant degree. The one that worked took a while to warm up (~20 minutes) though that was anticipated so I wasn't concerned. I returned the one that didn't get warm at all.
1,joke of a pad,should have looked at the wattage and wouldn't of wasted my time buying it and then turning around and returning it.However it will take some time before a competitor can compete against Amazon's ease of returning a product based on the system they've employed.Hats off to the system manager.
2,Not Nearly As Good As...,"This review is about the K & H 11x24-inch size pad. Not nearly as good as the competition! Petmate's 10 x 20-inch heating pad/bed warmer may be a few inches smaller, but it has at least twice the warmth as this K & H pad! (Petmate is 30 watts, K & H is 13 watts.) You get what you pay for; the K & H pad is a little cheaper, but the Petmate pad is better. We agree with the reviewer that said: There is not anything wrong with this pad; it just will forever live in the shadow of the Petmate branded one we have. This K & H pad is better than nothing, but not much. I called K & H customer service, thinking something was wrong with this unit. I was treated rudely and with an attitude that tells me I'm probably not the first one to call and express concern at the lack of heat. We also tried another K & H heated bed, the Lectro-soft, with the same poor heating result. We would not buy one of their products again."
5,Works great; no reason to replace the whole kitty cup!,"I finally decided that it wasn't necessary to replace the WHOLE heated cat bed, which I have done three times already. I never plug that kitty cup out, so I guess they wear down after a year or so.I finally found that I need only the heater insert and continue to use the bed. The warmer came promptly as promised, and it fits perfectly into the kitty cup. My cat is happy again after finally realizing her bed warms up!Nice product."
4,pet bed warmer,"Our cats love the bed warmer! It's not real large, but once they settle into their bed with the warmer on, they won't come out, even for dinner! It's winter in Colorado, and they think this is even better than a sunny spot in front of a window."
1,K & H pet bed heater malfunction issue,"Purchased this bed heater for my small dog to replace one that had finally failed over the years. This new heater pad caught me by surprise when after setting it up per instructions, tested it and let my dog use it, I noticed that she would get on the bed, then, 10 minutes or so later, get off of it. I was suspicious of why she would do that and got my infrared temperature device and found the top temp was running at 108 degrees (way too warm). I also noticed noticed when I tried to readjust the bed position and add more insulation, the temperature reading on the bottom side of the bed was very hot and running at 122 degrees. Obviously, this is unacceptable, unsafe for my pet and will be returned immediately. I recommend if you purchase this bed heater or another manufacturers device, that you check temperature, top and bottom, regularly to insure safety for you and your pet."
5,A response to esstee's review,"Thanks for the nice review. One comment though. All of the NASA images used on the Planet Earth series are available for viewing on any DVD-Video player or DVD-ROM computer. On a DVD-Video player just press the MENU button any time you see an image on screen you like. This will take you to a detail screen for that image. If you want to see a full screen version of that image just press the UP arrow and the screen will now show the original NASA image in the best resolution that a DVD-Video player can display. Pressing the MENU key again returns you to the frame of video where you left off.Higher resolution versions of each image are also available to users that have DVD-ROM drives, but it is important to note that all DVD-Video player users have access to the same images that DVD-ROM users do, and at the highest level of quality possible on a DVD player.ThanksRalph LaBargeProducer, Planet Earth: Series"
4,Surprisingly vivid writing by an actor,"Short story surrounding a childhood Christmas, penned by the late actor, Richard Burton. He was raised in Wales, mainly by his elder sister and her husband. The next-to-youngest child of a large extended family, in which his mother died after the birth of Burton's younger sibling, when Burton was only 2 years old. Vivid recollections by this multi-talented man. I wish he were still alive, and had the opportunity to expand his writings."
3,Good pianism in distorted and amateurish sound,"Some people are more tolerant than others when it comes to sound. I see that all reviews on this are glowing so far. The pianism is excellent, no doubt. But, considering these are modern(!) recordings they are rather poor. It all sounds amateurish and project a cheap and/or out-of-tune piano. I rather take old undistorted mono.But Ms. Clement is outstanding and it made me curious to know more about her -- which I didn't. In fact, you end up knowing more about her teacher --Bruce Hungerford (1922-1977)-- than her. With that, I am implying a shabby production.Still, if you are willing to invest the cheap asking prices and get a varied and engaging recital by a still unkown, go for it."
2,I second the questionable accuracy!,"The airport at Quito is not that wild...does it need some order, yes? Are people getting hit by police? NO! That is absurd.I find the story intriguing, but craziness like the airport story, locals not telling the police about guerrillas, and the mere fact that the spanish used in the book is atrocious. Vamos means ""Let's (we) go."" Not ""Vamoose"" like Yosimite Sam. Also, Joto is called Hoto many times...where was the editor? There are other ridiculous translations and misuse of Spanish. It did not seem to be intentional because when the oil workers used their spanish it fit the situation...the other misuses did not fit.If you want to read a kidnap tail...read this. If you want to read about the real Ecuador...go to another source."
1,Quality is not good,"Agreeing with other reviewers, I have found the quality to be really bad on this phone. People I call are constantly asking me to speak up - it sounds like I am calling people from Mars. The buttons are too small and many times they do not ""beep"" correctly - an annoyance especially when I am calling into phone trees (you know the ones, press 1 then press 2). I am so sorry I bought this phone. What a waste of money!"
3,Could have been better,"The two line, multiple headset capability drew me to this unit. The price is good compared with the Siemans gigaset, but the designers skimped in a few useful areas. The first is the memory. The unit's address book holds only 10 permanent one touch numbers which is far too few. The CID memory hold about 30 numbers which is better. Second the CID display is only 2 lines so it doesn't show both the ID and the phone number on one screen. There is a cumbersome scrolling procedure but they should have just added a third line to the display like my Sony. Finally, the setup and use of the phone is far too complicated. I have experience with setting up phones and other elctronic equipment, yet this set up challenged me. Overall just a cumbersome model but the price is right and the multiple headset feature is attractive."
2,Promising but Fell Short,"The book starts well, but never truly develops the characters. I wanted to like the main character, but never really got a chance to know him. The plot is thin, and deals mostly with internal conflict. Because of that (internal conflict in a not-fully functional character), it was a flat read for me."
3,Decent collection from Instinct Records,"Brought to you by many of the same folks who put together the terrific ""Raw Funk"" collection.You would think ""Funk It"" would be as good: you would be wrong."
5,The best scent,"I have loved this perfume since the day i first sniffed it. That was a long time ago. My biggest problem is that it is not sold out of the USA and that is such a shame. I have no idea what the reasons are for this but its very frustrating. So, any chance i get to find someone who would be visiting the USA on holiday, i try to order it. It is truly a gorgeous and simple smell."
5,Engaging and Fair,"The rise and ""fall"" of Halston the brand has always been an intriguing story to me. I finally found a copy of this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I felt the author fairly portrayed all sides of Halston the designer, he could have gone on the trashy end of Halston's later years but instead the author reported the drug and sex rumors without over embellishing. From a fashion business aspect, the book was fascinating, to see how quickly one can rise a legend and how simple mistakes and choices can make you ""out"" in the fashion world.I would have enjoyed more pictures of Halston's fashion designs throughout the year but I suppose there are art books for that aspect."
3,horrible halston,"fairly dry reading of a fascinating life, not nearly as naughty or revealing as I expected, I understand that a movie is being made based on this book (Alex Baldwin is expected to portray Halston). Let's hope the movie has more bite than this biography."
3,Of course it works but,It's a bit too rough for cold press.When I draw with a soft 2b pencil and then erase sometimes the lead smudges into the paper.Trying to lift colors from it is a bit hard since it just sucks in the color.
5,Watercolor Paper,A flawless transaction of a quality product.Arches 140 Lb Cold Press Watercolor Paper 22 x 30 inch - Pack of 5 Sheets
3,The weakest of the Dreadful Shadows' albums.,"While I am a big fan of Dreadful Shadows (And lead sing Sven in general), this is probably my least favorite of their works. ""Dead Can Wait"" and ""Through The Mirror"" are both really good song, however. All the songs are good on this CD, they just aren't 'The Cycle' or 'Buried Again' good. I suggest if you want to get this CD, you should probably buy it in the double pack, with the 'Homeless' E.P. That way you have songs like ""Homeless"", ""Sea of Tears"" (piano edit), ""True Faith"", ""Paradise"" and ""Homeless"" (Cyber Edit) to really even out the odd. It's still good. . Just not great."
5,Song Lyrics Are Inspiring.,The lyrics help me to worship. I love Angelina's voice. She clearly shows her reverence for her faith in the way she phrases the lyrics. My Favorite is the Deer's Cry.
2,Latitude c600,Purchased NEW. Never gets past a 54 percent charge. Lasts approximately 20 minutes in battery usage alone. I should be refunded half my money.
2,cheap laptop battery works like the price,"Bought this battery because I was given a laptop that was very old. The battery fits and did work but it doesn't keep a charge for very long. But I paid for what I got, a cheap replacement."
1,Battery lasted less than two months.,"Battery worked great for a month, then just died. Will not charge. Very disappointed in the life span of this battery. The last battery I had lasted at least a year or more."
3,The movie was better...but you'll still dig this,"This is the manga adaptation of the violent and controversial Japanese film by Beat Takeshi. Forty-two ninth graders set off on what they assume is a graduation camping trip. However, they have actually been shipped out to the deserted island of Okishima to serve as contestants on The Program, a state-sponsored reality tv show. The premise of the show is simple and horrifying: within three days only one student shall remain alive. On top of this, all of the students have high-tech collars implanted in their collars to monitor their vital signs. If no one has died in the first twenty-four hours, a bomb will be set off to kill them all. Each student gets a survival kit-and then takes off. The kids come from all types of backgrounds. The main character Suuya fights to stay alive and to protect the girl he likes; others go at it Lord of the Flies style. Human nature at its basest. Manga at its best."
2,A complete bastardization of a good story,"Being a big fan of the movie, I decided to pick up the first 3 mangas in the series after hearing how good it was. I was, and still am, a rabid fan of Battle Royale, it's one of the greatest films ever made. However, I was completely baffled with how bad this manga was. They completely ruined the story, thus making it hard to follow. They added the ""game show"" element which makes it totally cheesy. Art wise it's not bad, but that's the only reason it is getting two stars and not one. They made Nanahara annoying as hell, Noriko a whiny little bitch who always disputes everything, and Kitano WAY over the top. In the movie (and the novel), he's a real stone cold scary teacher, there's not much about him but yet there's something about him that makes him scary. Here, he's like Stewie Griffin from Family guy.Overall avoid this. This manga is so bad it plays out like a BR parody."
1,Twisted,"I checked this out online after hearing that Battle Royale was in the same vein as Death Note, one of my favorite stories. I read two chapters and was nearly physically sick.This story is twisted.The violence, the graphic, horrible violence - it's worse than anything you could see on TV. And while I understand the element of political satire, it's totally drowned out by the gore. That's a worthless message. Maybe the book is better, at least, that's what I hear; even so, I wouldn't touch this series ever, ever again.If you want to read a story that has suspense, great characterization, and that addresses moral issues - WITHOUT the horrible violence, read Death Note by Tsugumi Ohba."
1,extreamly violent manga...........,parents beware of this...... Battle royale tells the story bout 40 student raffeld to play death. there phycotic and perverted teacher enjoys watching them kill eachother......VERY GRAPHIC!!!! its more violent than the movie. There is even a rape scene between the teacher and a mother. AND BOOK3!!!! DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED. THEY TURNED A MOVIE MASTERPIECE IN TO A PIECE OF CRAP...THANX ALOT TOKYO POP!!!!1 THE PART WITH YOSHI GETTING SHOT IN THE MOUTH JUST MADE ME SICK! IF YOU HAVE KIDS UNDER 18 DONT LET THEM READ THIS DISGRACE!
4,"A good manga, but not for the kids","I really did like this manga. It is a lot faser moving than the novel, and is not bogged down by a serious case of ADD with the characters. The art is decent but a tad bit goofy at times, and a little to over drawn at other times (characters don't all look like 9th graders). Still, a good manga, although it is VERY violent, and does include a rape scene, as well as some mild nudity and panty shots."
2,Cheaper than the dvd... But not better...,"If you want an exciting story with great characterization and dark social satire then check out the novel or the movie. If you want to see students slaughtering each other interspersed with brief ""Here's what I was like before I died!"" vignettes then read the manga.After seeing the hatchet job Keith Giffen did to this book (as well as Battle Vixens) I've come to the conclusion that he must really hate manga. The plot gets boiled down to it's ""GOVERNMENT BAD! YOU KILL NOW!!!!"" essentials. And the oddly cartoony artwork creates a jarring juxtaposition to the ""money shot"" moments of violence."
4,This CD is one of the best CD N Sync has ever made!,"I especially like the dance version of the ""This I promise you"". I listen to it when I'm driving to or back from work. In our famous traffic jam hour, this music will make me want to dance with my car - I can weave in & out of the traffic beautifully! =)"
4,At long last,"At long last there is a clever, tongue-in-cheek book that is unique for this time. When everything is geared towards metrosexuals, it's great to read a down-to-earth version of how real men can be. This is the man whom we rely on to keep the world moving and working properly."
3,If we were all badasses this world would be boring...,A bad ass does what he wants when he wants...but make sure he does not wear shorts..wears wife beater shirts...drives a hog...owns a muscle car...and has a dead end job? Please...the Oxymoron is it takes all sorts to make this world go round and this book tells you what to do to be a bad ass...guess what got my own rules and I keep it simple...if you are a sterotypical bad ass you will LOVE this book if you want to enjoy some of the finer things in life other that cheap beer and bars this book should be taken for entertainment purposes only and not a guide to life...even a bad ass should know there is more to life then this book...but enjoy...it not all bad...
4,"""The most significant bypass in recent history?""","Rabaul was probably the most fortified bastion created on land captured by the Japanese in the Pacific during WWII, and this well-written novel shows why. It was protected with tunnels similar to Iwo Jima, but was situated near Australia. The big question was how to destroy it, and McArthur (as described in the excellent biography ""American Ceaser"") figured out how: isolation. This saved many lives, but many were lost in heroic acts to reach that point. This novel, by Christopher Wood (who has spent considerable time in the area) describes some of those attempts and ties them together with the visit to the island by General Yamamoto (""the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack"")and his early demise.I think that anyone with an interest in the remarkable history of this period couched in a very readable adventure novel will enjoy this book"
2,Great Features but Unusable,"I originally purchased this phone because of its ability to act as a pbx system at a low cost. It would have been ideal for small businesses or offices.The drawback is simply the sound quality. For a phone with such great potential, Casio should have put a little more work into this ""small"" detail.While on the handset the volume was always too low no matter how high you had the volume. The speakerphone was useless. There is an additional jack (rj-11) for a headset however it was geared for the older style headsets which are expensive...More importantly, while using this phone I was always asked to speak up by the party on the other end.If you don't mind lacking sound quality in your phone system then this may be a good purchase. For me I would choose to go with a system with fewer features rather than not be heard."
2,Complete System Needed,"I have it for about 3 years now and is the primary phone in my home office. But instead of using it I would rather pickup my cellphone which has more friendly usable features. The headset easily falls off the base if you install it on a wall or it may not settle correctly and you end up with a dial tone. Fumbled with it multiple times, and the reason why its still in my desk is that it makes my desk it look like an office desk (its a decor)."
1,"In a pure office environment, maybe.","As dedicated office equipment this system might have some value. For use in the home with any additional phones it has little value. I purchased four; one for the kitchen, home office, master bedroom and den. A call answered on a non system phone (a bedroom trimline) can not be picked up by any of the CASIO phones. The Telephones have a privacy feature that prevents other Casio extensions from picking up unless the call is first placed on hold. The answering system ""Auto Attendant"" takes four programming steps to turn on. When on it disables the ringers on all other Casio extensions. Most of us are used to the anwswering machine always being on and picking up after four or so rings. Quality of calls is good and the intercom feature is quite useful, except when an extension is on privacy. If your still interested check the auction site, there are four at half price."
3,Need music on hold feature,"This phone system has no audio jacks that allow music on hold feature, so you can not connect it to a audio source like radio or CD player. When I put my customers on hold, all they hear is silence. And the On-Hold Plus equipment is not very compatible with this system."
4,Great Workout!,"This is a great dvd, the steps weren't complicated and they made it fun. I especially loved the cool down, it was hot and you can use it in other places *wink*. It even had my 4yr old nephew dancing."
1,Disappointed...,What a disappointment this DVD was :( I wish I could return it. I did not learn any dance moves. I love reggae and dancehall music but the music on the DVD was not great and it was a bunch of people girating with little instruction.
2,No pedals? Wtf,"If you hope for set of pedals. Look somewhere eelse. This is only the pedal board. Hell knows why they have a picture with the pedals. And you have to pay 120 lousy dollars for a stupid platform to put the pedals on. 120, you have use the frigan box to mount them on. Don't buy this if you expectthis product to come with pedals"
4,Too Much Information,"I enjoyed the book as it is rare to find much info on the Rosebud battle. However, there is a thing about too much information and this author provides it. After a detailed explanation of the battle he describes it over and over from different participants. Enough already! We get it. It is a well-written book, but should be half the size with careful editing."
5,Adorable Algae,"Cute and was exactly what my daughter wanted. It was perfect addition to her collection of germs, viruses, and dna."
5,Very Original,"People are amazed at these Microbes, shock of how cool they are and my daughter had a teacher ask where she could order them from to teach in class."
5,"Marty, we miss you","Marty Robbins was one of my favorite 'cowboy' singers. One disc has his rock era represented, one had his country, and one has his cowboy material, I play that one the most. This collection has real memories for this 63 year old."
4,Wonderful,"This book is wonderful. I found that it gives me insights into things that I knew the answers to but was refusing to put them into motion. This book let me know that it's ok. Learning how to balance your personal and professional lives is a very difficult thing, ""Life is a Balancing Act"" helped show me that it doesn't have to be as difficult as we make it.I truly enjoyed it."
4,Good bath mat for budget minded.,For the price it is an excellent bathroom mat/rug. It soakes up water like a sponge and drys out rather quickly. It grips the floor well and dosen't loose it's backing easily in the washing machine (like many can).
3,Wish it didn't squeak,"This would be a great product if, after a month of my using it, it hadn't started to squeak. The boot style is slimming, it's quite comfortable once it's been broken in, and it's waterproof so I bought it to use at work during the winter months. Once it started squeaking, though, I could no longer use it at work or anywhere the environment is quiet enough to hear the squeaking: houses of worship, lectures (if you have to get up and walk to the ladies' room), etc.If you work outdoors or in retail, this product would be a good buy. Don't get it if you work in a hushed corporate environment unless you have replacement office shoes."
4,Great shoe,This is a very comfortable shoe as we know Rockport makes. But be warned that this shoe runs small so you should get 1 size bigger than you normally wear. If you get your size it will be too tight and small. But other than that it's a great shoe.
5,Great stuff.,"Smooth lotion, not sticky as some are. Great scent and long lasting. Quick delivery. Plan on ordering again! A little bit goes a long way."
4,Nice Scent!,It smells really fabulous. Lightness leads to elegance. Miniaturization is satisfying. I cannot find anything imperfect about it. Everyone shall give a try.
5,Good but a little expensive,The lotion is nice by applying on skin or smelling. Just a little bit expensive. But worth it if u life Green tea's smell. Quickly absorbed by skin.
5,Chillin',"When I listen to the Chant of Metta, I fall into a somewhat of a trance of peaceful and deep sedation and can feel the heartbeat of existence itself. I am transported into a zone of deep relaxation and trust. Metta takes me to a place where I enjoy visiting and remaining; I visit often. Metta is a bridge into heavens' of bliss itself."
3,The best single volume history of the Supreme Court,"Schwatz's history is easily accesible and not bogged down with too much technical jargin. This book is best for non-students of the Court for it offers little more than an overview without a great deal of significant analysis. The exception being the fairly good case studies of Dred Scott, Lochner, Brown, and Roe. Though the book offers little to the historical debate concerning the Court, it wasn't really supposed to. Schwartz wanted to write a relatively short, accesible, single volume history of the Supreme Court. He succeded. I recomend it for anyone interested in the basics of the Court and it's history."
4,"Excellent for beginners ,but","A well written introductory book on aerodynamics . Advanced printing technology also adds to the book`s qualities .However , this is not the book for someone who wants to excel at aerodynamics .Like other more recent books ,It aims for medicore level.For example, there are no expansions of advanced topics for the curious student.Also a subject of practical and historical importance like complex potential & conformal mapping is omitted. Summary : If you are new to Fluid Dynamics ,buy it .If you intend to be a real scientist ,you should look for Karamcheti for the incompressible part ,and Shapiro for the compressible part."
2,Poor Reference for the PE Civil Engineering Exam,It appears the people who put this book together have not looked at the NCEES website. Approximately 1/3 of this book is dedicated to airport and rail transportation. Subjects other than Transportation are not addressed. Most questions are not in the new test format and solutions are not fully explained. The few tips about the Depth Transportation Exam are buried in narrative and hard to find.
1,worthless,Don't bother spending money on this reference. It will be of little value preparing for the PE exam. Too much information on airports that will nevber be on the PE exam.
5,helpful and simple,"Straight forward and honest, helped me understand a lot of things I had not before - better than previous reviewer led me to believe!"
3,Nice,"These cards are very nice to use. I have used a lot of them and these are good, the best for what I want. Wonderful price also."
1,Not complete,You sent me two differnt copies of thisDVD and neither one had all the videos on them. They were each a sampler with only 3 videos on them. I ended up cancelling the order and ordering it from another company.
1,Expensive,It cost me 40 for the 2 CDs as I had to pay customs fee + VAT when I went to collect it - not delivered due to money being owed.Therefore it was a real let down. I will not be ordering any more!! Music good but as yet I do not like it as much as previous.
2,Planet Love,"I really wanted to like this cd, but the only feeling I got while listening to it is ""why did I buy this ?"" Sudha has a magical voice, but this is no Sadhana. I suppose I am spoiled from her last two cds and expected more of the same, but really didn't expect her to be singing Hawaiian melodies."
4,So far so good,"I recieved these controllers for christmas. I have had the console they made for years, but never got the wireless controllers. I now have a projector and I can keep the console in the hall closed and geek out to my 8 bits again!"
1,Very Disappointed,"Buyer BEWARE!!!!These are not for the Original NES, you must have a NEX Clone. These are not the limited edition version which has a wireless receiver that you can plug into the NES. These are pretty worthless unless you have a NEX."
1,did england make this flag?,You can see through it because the material is so thin. This cheaply made flag is an insult to the enduring spirit of the Irish nation. For $5 its not even worth it. I have had thicker napkins.
1,product defect and not worth returning for the price,The flag arrived on time but has either some kind of ink or stain in the orange area. It's not worth the trouble to go to the post office and return for 3.99. I can't find how to contact the seller and ask for another one and the dial back from Amazon customer service (call back now option) didn't work twice.I would rather have paid more and gotten a good product.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HDI5Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,Irish flag,My Irish flag was beautiful. However after being hung outside for about a year it is now falling apart. Its about that time to buy another flag but I will be shopping around for one that is better quality.
1,Warning!,"These look like they would be great flags, and I ordered one, however, it never was sent to me. It looks as though more than one company is selling this flag, so if you're interested in it, DO NOT buy from sevenbrothersmercantile. As I said, I ordered one a month ago and never received it. I also emailed him to inquire about the order and after I asked him point blank if he had sent it, he stopped replying my emails. After getting upset about my service, I checked out his feedback. 96%... not bad. However, I looked deeper and saw that several people had the same problem as I did. Never receiving their product, not getting help, being ignored. So, congratulations, 96% who were worth his time... other 4%... I'm sorry and I'm with you on this. Any future buyers... good luck, receiving any kind of good service from sevenbrothersmercantile."
4,3' X 5' Irish Flag,"This is exactly what I expected for the price. It is not that good quality and it is very thin, but I kind of knew it would be because of the price. I needed it to hang on a wall indoors and it will be good for that, but if you are looking for a flag to hang outdoors on a pole or whatever don't get this one. It will work but will not last very long. After a month people will probable think it's a Italian flag because the sun will fade it. That is if it is not destroyed because of rain/snow ect. I gave it four stars because of the price and the fact that it will work good for my purposes."
2,Color Mix,"I got this for my daughter and when the flag got to me it was folded in a plastic bag (as expected) but once I opened it I noticed that both the green and orange colors had bled into the white area at some point during productyion of packaging. Not a lot but enough to easily notice and it did not come out, lending back to the assumed ""make it and get it out the door as fast as you can"" process that left the paint still wet when it was packaged. If you're not worried about it and just want some representation of th eIrish flag cheap, you've found your product. Otherwise you shoudl look somewhere else."
3,Not bad,What can you expect for a buck. I wish the material was heavier though. Not bad for the price I guess
5,Great size,"Looks good and although it is indoors only, It fits and looks great hanging on the wall. I would be a repeat buyer."
4,Loved it.,Great flag. very nicely done. wish the flag wouldn't have had so many folds in it to where I had to iron it but I can't complain to much.
4,Great decoration flag.,"Irish pride. I collect a few flags here and there. This flag is a thin nylon material that is awesome for decoration in rooms, etc. I think it'll do well with outdoor use but it'll probably fade and fray over time."
1,Don't bother....,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Most of the objects on the cover don't have any patterns inside the book. What I didn't understand when I bought it was that it's a book for beginners, with very simple and ugly designs and with just pictures of the more advanced ones."
1,Not for children,"Was disappointed with the graphic nature of this book. Not appropriate for children, objectifies women. Male characters are generic and lack the same anatomy traits as females in the book. We have many Chris Hart books but returning this one to Amazon."
3,Ok for someone learning to draw....,"The good: For someone who is learning to draw (and can) this will be helpful.The bad: observation of human and animal anatomy would be better for the student. Musculature can be picked up from health and body building magazines or online articles. there really isn't anything ""cutting edge"" about it for anyone who has picked up graphic novels or comics before.Is it worth it? yeah I guess so... for the inexperienced artist (in ANY discipline, whether painter, sculptor, graphic artist, comic book artist, etc etc) and as a quick reference book. But once you get into high detail artwork, where perhaps you want to show the texture of the muscle tissue underneath the skin (lighting and shading) it won't help. Poses and muscle groups that's about it."
1,What ever!,"High class porn!! No, really has he every seen a woman that you can use as a floatation device??"
2,"Good, not great","I am all for how-to beginners art books; however, this really isn't a how-to at all. I really wish I had read some reviews before I bought the book. Although artists are naturally visual learners, it really doesn't help create a process in how one draws the anatomy. Yes, it does have some pretty fantastic illustrations, but not a lot of information. Plus, I'm really, really disappointed in how the woman figure was portrayed. The women figures are found in provocative clothing and poses. Would not recommend buying."
4,i love it,"it've had a hard time finding a really good anatomy book, and while the drawings kind of suck, the book is great for the style it is trying to teach. it's a great book to look at especially if you are taking an anatomy drawing class, but are more interested in cartoons like i am."
4,Very good book.,This was a very good book on the body. The step by step process was what I was looking for. This is the book for any body that wants to learn how to draw the human body in many ways and it was easy to understand. I have recommended this book to all my drawing students.
5,it's great,It shows the different sizes of character body types. It shows the pressures of movement & action. It shows the back muscles & front muscles. it also shows bone structure & how appearance effects who the character is. it's comicbook anatomy in every way I can just about think of it.
5,Instant Classic,This show was an instant classic when it first arrived on Fox. There hasn't been a show like this on TV before and there will probably never be a show like this again. There's nothing else I can say.
1,"Big Bad Mama II, not what you were looking for","If you were hoping for a skin flick, this is not it. A couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at Julie McCullouh (...), in bed, is not enough too qualify. The acting is awful. Angie looks great for her age. Still not enough."
5,tina is the bomb,"i was born in 1993 so i really didn't know she had a past.i just knew about her song (whats love got to do with it).but when i saw the movie of her life it was like (woo) i love her.thats when i became a real fan of hers.so i had to have the soundtrack cd.my favorites on there are,its gonna work out fine,a fool in love,well really all the songs.but i wish they had tina's wish,shake a tail feather,and river deep mountain high.if you think you are really a tina turner fan or you know you are,than this is a cd for you!!!i think angela basselt did a wonderful job as tina.laurence fishburne was good too."
1,I wish there was a score to this,"Nice but not quite. Fantastic movie, but rather than just the movie soundtrack, why not an original score for the movie aswell?! I was hoping there would be an original score disk because I practically loved the instrumental piece (the movie's theme song) with Angela Bassett as Tina running out of the hotel to the hotel across the street, after the big limo fight scene with Ike (played by Laurence Fishburn). But this disk did not feature any soft, instrumental music which played throughout the movie. The only nice song on this disk is ""Why must we wait until tonight?"" This cd is harldy worth the purchase."
2,Where's Ike?,"I was looking for the original recordings of some of Ike and Tina's songs. They are not here. The re-recorded material is ok, yet lacks the sound and vocal intensity of the originals; like 'Nutbush City Limits', for example. Where is her work with Phil Spector? There should be an ""expanded"" edition of this soundtrack with some of the original recordings that include or are intertwined with the film's original score."
3,All that's got to do with Tina,This cd is the soundtrack to the movie about Tina's life up to the early '80's and her uproaring comeback.The music scored here is basically her oldies updated thru newarrangements for the '90's.It is good listening to Tina sing an updated version of NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS (much better than the remixed one appearing on her greatest hits package) or getting wild on DISCO INFERNO.WHY MUST WE WAIT UNTIL TONITE is a great track written by Bryan Adams and I DON'T WANNA FIGHT is pure Top 40 AC.Nice memories and great songs
3,Text? Yes! New illustrations? No!,"I have loved this book for SO long, so when I saw this new addition I ordered a copy. I still adore the text. It is pure magic. I was very disappointed in the new illustrations, though. The original illustrations were often inside the cave lit by the fire with the feeling of the dark just outside its glow. Completely stunning and almost haunting! I miss them in this new addition."
1,For the Dreamboat,"We found this movie entralling, with fabulous acting and special effects, especially by the kid who dies, who is reincarnated as the science teacher Mr Poole from Sabrina the Teenage Witch.I found the ""Dreamboat"" teacher very attractive, and it was the best scene in the movie when the yucky pervy girl said that because it was then we realised we weren't the only ones who felt that way about Richard Cox. For him, 10 stars. Especially for all the times he tried to hit on the Andrea chick.Paedophile a million."
1,do not rent this movie!,"I wanted to rent a cheesy horror movie, and I got it. This movie wasn't even remotely scary or even freaky in any way. It shouldn't be labeled a horror movie"
5,An Amazing Amount Left To Sing About ...,"As Bing Crosby used to sing, you've got to accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative, latch on to the affirmative ...Knowing how to attract attention to your book or your blog is important. Being able to create not only an impression, but also a memory - and a good one - is also important. How to Be Your Own Publicist shows you how to do both."
1,No stock!,Remove the item from the shopping page when you run out. I still would like this book if you can get it?
4,Que bueno es el Caramelo Macizo!,"Caramelo Macizo is La Lupita's best album. This is their latest album and it's a gem. Heavy in funk and soul mixed with pure rock 'n' roll and pleasant ballad sounds ...This Mexican band brings a well done album which has a variety of songs of which ""Supersónico"" and ""Al Caer el Mall"" stand out...the partnership of husband and wife Hector Quijada and Rosa Adame on vocals is truly special...Hector has one of the most different if unique voices of any Latin Alternative band today...truly recommended...hopefully the next album will top this one!"
1,Not happy with this piece,"I know Swiss Gear is very good brand. I have already Swiss Gear Laptop bag with me, which is so good. Having this impression, I have bought this piece for out door purpose. After receiving this product, I was so disappointed. Quality is not good. It's not soft at all and more over it's very small piece. I may not recommend this product."
4,Really for Plus Size Women,"I was at first skeptical about purchasing this outfit because the size stated ""plus size"". I have come to find out that most products are not really for plus size women, even though they say they are. I bought this outfit out of faith that it would fit me... I'm a 22w/24w in pants and pretty top heavy. The outfit came with strechy lace material and very pretty/sexy. I could not fit my boobs in the top half, but it still looks pretty good in it. It does not cover the bottom area, but the material stretches just enough to go over it. I'm not really worried about it fitting perfect, because I know that all of that is unnecessary. The g-string that came with it doesn't cover much, but I didn't buy if for that, I bought some crouchless boyshorts to go with the top part! A very sexy touch to the outfit. Overall, I like the product and surprised that it actually fit. Hopefully they will improve the boob area to make it more for plus size women, but overall, I like it!"
2,The Motor Sound Is Picked-up By The Mic When Recording,"Ok, probably like you I thought this was a very cool camcorder. It's a great design, small with lots of features. The problem is that it has one fatal flaw. The left and right mic are on top and pick-up a high pich whine of the camcorder motor when you are recording. I tried to get used to it but after a few days returned the product with much regret. As an Engineer I couldn't help but be amazed how could such a simple and fatal flaw could have made it to market on such a great product."
2,I Could Have Done Better,"The size of the camera is very compact and handy but it has its drawbacks. The still picture quality is not very good with white lines running vertically, looking like a pin striped suit. The LCD Display is useless in very much light and is very small. The battery life is only about 1/2 hour shooting video and if you would want to take stills that use the flash, battery life is much shorter."
4,great camera,"easy to use, the small size is perfect! still camera is much pleasure, an ideal way to get your pictures on your pc and tranfer them by e-mail. just the perfect camera for a reasonable price"
2,still pictures (@!&*),"The quality of the still pictures just @#@$........I just bought this camcorder five days ago 08-20-01 and Im going to take it back today after work. The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because the camcorder portion seems to be realy good, but I also wanted the still pictures to be great for [the price]. sorry JVC but you realy let me down on this one...."
2,Great Camera...Atrocious Software Performance,"Have had this wonderful camera for about a year; have struggled that long with the software. Makes it almost impossible to transfer pix from camera to PC, and repeated trips to JVC and Mr Photo websites have failed to find any updates or even replacement software. At this point, I have tried several different photo programs and none can download from the camera to the PC.I have excellent pictures, but little way to enjoy them except in the camera. I just can't believe a huge company like JVC would leave so many customers hanging like this, with very pricey equipment and no way to use it.The camera gets five stars, the software actually gets zero."
1,Don't Buy!!! this if you want to load the pictures onto a PC,"I bought a JVC GR-DVM70 when they were hot, shiny, and new. Paid a ton for it too. Camera works good and is small enough to fit in loose pockets. I really enjoy the physical camera. Turns out however, that JVC makes the WORST software in the world. I don't know who their software engineers are, but they wrote (...) software and included it with the camera. Also, my camera is not USB and that is a huge part of the problem. You really should only buy a USB based camera because serial based is extemely slow in transferring images and I can never connect the camera to the computer for downloading stills without having endless problems. Just DON'T buy it (or if you must, buy the one I own)."
3,Poor Stills Resolution,The one thing I am really disappointed about re this camera is the poor quality of the digital stills. It is all very nice to have a still pic facility on a camcorder but the resolution is visibly fuzzy - it is only 640 x 480! JVC should not have bothered with this feature at this level of quality.
3,it is good one but not excellent,"generelly speaking, it is a good mini dv camcorder which is small size, lot of function and good quilty video image. but still image qulity is not good, especially indoor shooting.flash light doesn't help much. another problem is nightalive function is bad, video qulity dramatically decrases because it's shooting speed slows down, which is much worse than other digital camcorder.my point is if you use it outdoor most of time, it is good one."
3,JVC Digital video camera,"I've had this camera since last Christmas and still cannot operate the software! The Ulead software provided for the video is not user friendly; there are more cords, wires, options and complications with the whole system than the average picture taker can handle. However the picture quality is outstanding."
2,Great when it works.,"My JVC is 2 years old. I've had to replace the mother board once, and recently have another malfunction."
5,Great Blues CD,"My 24 year old son is into all kinds of good blues. One day, while I was playing on his computer, he hooked me up to this CD, as I also dig the blues. As for his singing voice....I happen to like it. I keep this cd onREPEAT on my player when it is on.The whole thing is worth the purchase. Great Blues CD. He rocks on guitar, too. All Good."
5,Installed easily. Works better than original,"The dimmer worked perfectly the first time I turned it on. It was better than the original dimmer because it allowed for a dimmer dim than the original, which was brighter at the lowest dim. I had a little trouble with installing the dimmer because my pole lamp's pole was too small in diameter, so I had to improvize by removiong the inner nut on the on/off switch and using it to anchor the switch from the outside. This was no big problem. Otherwise, the rest of the installation was easy and went well. Total installation time was about half an hour. I did it with a pair of pliers, electrical tape and a pocket knife. I would buy this dimmer again. I hope it lasts me along time though."
5,Perfect Fit,My old dimmer died in my lamp and we like it so much I had to search to find one. This one was easy to install and replace the old one perfectly.
4,Does as advertised,"Had two 500W torchiere lamps we like due to the indirect lighting for the TV room. Both had 3-way switches that were failing - only working on high setting. This dimmer was easy to install with some basic tools and a few wire nuts. Be sure to read all the comments from othersabout diameter of the lamp pole, as this item would not fit in a different model 300W lamp we have with a 1"" pole diameter. We're much happier with the dimmer than the 3-way switch...can set the light level exactly where you want it."
1,Arrived dysfunctional,"The product arrived defective; I noticed that the off position did not feel smooth (a bit scratchy feeling). After installation, the dimmer switch did not operate correctly and after turning it off and on about twenty times it quit functioning altogether. I paid $2.12 shipping charges to send it back and was refunded two dollars less than the $12.50 I originally paid; I am out $4.12 and have heard nothing from Buy-it-now-store. However, I found the same Angelo Brothers Halogen Dimmer in better packaging at Menards including wire nuts for $9.98.I will not shop with Buy-it-now-store again."
4,halogen dimmer,"It works great. We thought it would have a switch we could TURN. iT'S A LITTLE HARD WITHOUT ONE, BUT OTHERWISE IS GREAT."
3,This is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) project!,"Just a warning to those thinking about buying this dimmer switch: it's something you have to install INSIDE your lamp, replacing the existing on/off switch assembly.I've done it before, and it's not too difficult, but it does require some tools (screwdriver, wire cutters-- a good Swiss Army knife should do). If you'd rather not open up your lamp and MacGyver its guts, you should look for other, EXTERNAL dimmer options."
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality, shoddy workmanship, sums up this product. The Westek is a far superior product if you are concerned about *quality*. Yes, the fit is tighter, but it does fit. And it comes with the wire nuts required for the job.The Westek is encased inside a hard plastic shell and so can withstand some jostling during installation, but the Westinghouse unit is wrapped in flimsy paper with no support for the switch mechanism itself, which is important for the next note:The ""press fit"" for the switch knob on the Westinghouse unit is not only too tight and impossible to slide off without marring it, the forces required also can (and did) damage the actual switch such that it didn't work properly. In fact, it seemed as if the knob was glued onto the pole.So I just tried both units and the Westek wins - in my book - by a huge margin."
4,Favorite lamp back in service,This was easy to install taking just a couple of minutes. It got a favorite lamp back in service. The knob is just a press on plastic thing so will fall off and roll under furniture if handled indelicately. I'm sure you can guess how I know that.
1,Very used copy,I received this today and am so frustrated with the condition that I'm planning to return it. There is highlighting on many pages and the assessments in the book are already all filled in - boxes checked and everything! I would not purchase from this person again!!!!!!!
3,good book not great,"This is a very comprehensive approach to emotional eating which I am starting. For me, discipline is tough at times. This book provides a lot of good simple and helpful discussion of issues with a defined program of making progress one day at a time. If you expect to buy this book, get the answers and move on - don't waste your money. If you think you are worth the investment of time and care - and you are - then get this book. Be prepared it will take time. This could be a great book for two people to buddy up with or a small group.I do recommend the book - just like most everything else - this book will give you what you put into it - and it does have some good steps (although I don't agree with all of them). I am going to be looking for a buddy - i might even start a small group to work through together.Godspeed and know that YOU ARE WORTH THE TIME AND CARE!"
3,More action than war,I am a great fan of War movies and was quite impressed byTae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War(Tae Guk Gi) and much more so byAssemblywhich is IMHO one of the best war movies these last years.So I was quite excited when I knew that the film 71-Into the Fire was being released.But the film has caused me some disappointment. Production value is high and the open scene is very strong but it isn't a serious war movie but rather an action flick with all the extras and as such does not satisfy my taste. Since it is based on true events I would have much prefered they stick to those rather than make it into some sort of Hong Kong-ish action film. Whatever is added to the story is what made it fail to be something special.That being said it is an o.k. action film with a few bright spots but I was hoping for a war movie.
5,Loved it !!!,"Of course the only reason I had bought the movie was because T.O.P is in it and I love historical movies. My arrival of the movie was fast and there was no damage, so that's a plus but overall I really enjoyed the movie and can't wait to watch some."
3,"Cute and nostalgic, but not great","This CD was not popular, and while it's not fantastic, it does deserve more credit than it got. It's a good debut CD, considering the guys were only about 10 years old. If you're a fan of the group, it's fun to listen to this and hear how it all began. There was some other kid instead of LDB, and he didn't seem to add much to the group. Batman was already taking the lead and was talented at singing slow songs. Romeo was already doing the rapping, although it didn't fit into the songs as well as it does now. This CD isn't up to ""Playtime Is Over"" standards, but some of the slow songs are almost as good. If you're looking for music from Immature/IMX as you know them, this isn't it. But if you want to hear their cute 10-year-old music and uncover some Immature history, get this CD."
5,That CD Is Da Bomb,"I Do Remember immature when i was Like 9 or 10 and I Like that Song ""Tear it up"" which is from Bebe's Kids.Before there's LDB,There's Half-pint and I Really like him because He's philipino and He's Well,CUTE!!!.I Like All their Songs Including ""Da Munchies"",""I wanna Know U That Way"",You're All that"",""Meet me Outside"",and ""(GooD things)Comes to Those Who Wait"",Even There's some Skits Including ""Mom's illin'(40oz. edit) when Romeo asked Half-pint what A Honey dip is and His Mom Said ""Boy,Get Yo Butt in Yo Room Talking about a Honey dip"",LOL!!!.It Brings me Gr8 memories and Half-pint,I Miss U!!!"
1,Wish I could give it zero .....................,"The author redefines ""paradigm"" to his own specifications and then builds a house of cards on shifting sands.Totally without merit, except through exposing the pretensions of other well-known authors who praised the book."
5,Very few books actually change your life. This one will.,"Very few books actually change your life. But this one will. Of the many hundreds of business books I've read over the past 20 years, few have had the impact on me as this one by futurist, Joel Barker. The very concept of ""paradigms"" is, in and of itself, mind-altering as it creates an awareness that enables us to see the world through new eyes. This book is a classic from which you will gain new insights every time you re-read it (which I, personally, have done at least 5 times over the past 10 years since I first discovered it.) Those who ignore the concepts contained in this book will sooner or later find themselves going ""back to zero."" (I also highly recommend the video version as well!)"
3,"Very cute, but...","I am glad that I did not pay full price for this! I saw it elsewhere for more than double what it was on amazon! The paint design is very cute but also kind of cheap looking- I doubt it'll hold up without chipping off once my daughter is old enough to use it. Also it was a pain to put together. The instruction manual wasn't helpful because I had to put it together in different stages than the way they listed in order to get it to actually fit! I thought I was going to have to return it because I couldn't get the backrest portion to fit in the holes. One side would seat in but the other side would rest on top of the seated portion. Finally, my husband decided to bolt it in to see if that would help pull the backrest down- and it did, so we were able to keep it. It's very sturdy for a child, so that is good. Overall I think it's okay for the price. I'm happy enough with it to not return it."
3,Till Eulenspiegel and Cervantes,"It's from a slightly later period, but the tale about the blank canvas in which only the highborn can see a picture reminds me of a one-act play by Cervantes. I forget the title, but it concerns a group of strolling players who set up their stall in a small-town square and convince the spectators (esp.the alcalde and co.) that only true Christians can see the play that is patently not taking place, the stage being empty. And it is, of course, essentially the same story, as someone else hinted, as H.C. Andersen's 'The Emperor's Clothes'."
2,Slow and Boring,"I do not care for the TV series but its appeal was showcasing spoiled, out-of-control children of parents with more money than brains. However, I watched this movie because of Alyson and Amanda's (Aly & AJ) involvement. Unfortunately, without the reality appeal, the story was boring and the movie draggy. The acting was ok but the plot was weak and the script was unrealistic. I sensed a disconnect between the actors and the movie as if they were sleepwalking through it. It was a waste of all the actors' talents. Watch it as a dollar rental."
2,Bad acting = cheap movie,"I was eager to see this since I was a fan of the tv series.First of all, the black her, she is not a good actress.You can tell this movie had a low budget, another reason why it was not put into the theaters, on top of a bad movie.The plot is basically like the show, 2 girls try to outbeat eachother in parties. But, in this movie, the girls in the end end up realizing they were being greedy and that it all went to their heads, not like the show.Hellogoodbye performs like half of a song.Aly was definatly better in this movie than her sister, I have to say.But they were both okay, the best thing in the movie.Aj plays a stereotypical animal/nature girl, and ALY plays the rich, spoiled girl.I could barely sit through this, sorry but it SUCKED.I think that this movie is best for the younger preteens, who also like high school musical, zac efron, hannah montana, suite life of zac & cody etc... disney kids."
2,Political ad pretending to be movie,"This is nothing more than an extremely poor attempt at selling political ideas to kids in a creative way. It's boring, with a weak plot and surprisingly lackluster acting from Ali and AJ who are usually good performers. I bought it for my 8 year old daughter because she likes their singing and enjoyed ""Cow Belles."" But I think even a parent with Liberal ideology (which is what this film blatantly pushes), would be embarassed by this pathetic attempt at entertainment. To say I was disappointed would be a huge understatement."
4,My daughter loved it...,If you've seen the series on t.v. then you'll appreciate the movie as well. It's reality t.v. only movie length.
5,"José José, a great artist.","José José is a great artist, his voice, his feelings, and the cuality of the songs he play, is great too."
2,Hopefully BETTER than collection 1!!,"I'm VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED with collection 1, for EXCLUDING the ENTIRE year 0f the 1966 episodes!! Hopefully, Dan Curtis did a BETTER job on THIS ""collection"". Too bad, ALL of the 1966 episodes are sold on VHS ONLY!...I'll just have to wait and see!"
2,Dark Shadows review,I was very pleased with the dvds on the whole. Disk 3 had a fault in it that caused it to skip. There were scratch marks on the underside. It only affect a short piece in the program. Otherwise the DVDs were great. This brought back old memories for me. As a teen I saw many of the episodes after school.
2,Could have been so good!,"I loved the TV show Dark Shadows and even was able to sit through the Johnny Depp movie. And so, I went back to my Kindle and bought one episode of Dark Shadows to see if I still loved it. Well, it is still fun, camp and just the way I remembered it. Sadly it is priced more horrifically than Barnabus on a bad day. The season is over %60 and an ""episode"" like the one I chose was 12 minutes running time...the rest had been commercials that were cut away. Amazon tells me that they did not set this price. I'm sad for everyone all the way around...this old gem will have to remain in the coffin."
3,Very economical,I guess if you have to use it around tress it would suffice but even a cat will bend it when you have it for a fence. It is light and flexible though so that is a plus and just remember not to try to keep anything inside like for a fence and nothing else
4,Good quality.,"This was a good product of high quality. Unfortunately, the harness that came with it, was not."
5,certified ophthalmic assistant exam review manual,This manual was excellent in preparing me for my C.O.A. exam. It helps you to realize and improve upon your weak area's and to reinforce your not-so weak area's. It is much like the exam itself. I will definetly be using C.O.T. exam review manual to help study for my C.O.T. exam.
5,Ophthalmic Trivia - makes studying fun!,"This book is wonderful for those of you who don't have a lot of sit down time to study. I went through the book and was able to identify the areas I needed to study most. This helped me avoid excess study time in areas I was already fairly comfortable in. It is also a nice size book to carry around with you so whenever you have a free minute, you can quiz yourself. I also used it at work as a trivia game with my other co-workers. It made learning fun! I definately recommend this book to anyone hoping to pass the COA exam."
5,Great Review Book!!! I Just Passed today!!!,"Don't let anyone tell you different, I got this review manual and studied basically nothing but it and just passed my COA today!!! I was even told at Jacapho, that I have waisted my time studying this book and that I should have rescheduled my exam cause none of the questions that are in this book are on the exam!! Well guess what she was not right!! Even though the wording is not verbatium, the information is very valuable- it is a study guide, not the answers to the COA test!! Without it I would not have passed!! It made me aware of the things that I needed to read and do more research on and focus more on those things verses reading some huge book full of words and not really making you think through the whys and why nots- this book is so great cause if you don't get the question correct, it goes into detail and explains why, which proves to be way more valuable!!!GET IT!!!"
3,Of passing interest,"I'm fascinated by ""then and now"" picture compilations. That said, this book does have some really good examples of the genre, however they are surrounded by much less interesting and really unimportant locations throughout NYC. It's a mix. If you like to see how a great city changes, this will have some utility. As a former native New Yorker, I found enough to make me glad I'd bought it but not enough to delight me."
5,Good Video,This video is very well done and has a lot of information about most species that trappers persue. This is a very well done video with some scenery thrown in. Not really a begginers video but good entertainment for trappers.
2,Just doesn't work out.,"Okay, lot of problems kept me from buying this one.1: What little pictures there are are black and white. 2: The details barely skim the surface. It doesn't do the game any justice. 3: It tells you how to beat the game. Period. It doesn't tell you how and where to find every item, what every monster looks like and is located, and tells you nothing about the entire second quest of the game (Richter). 4: The strategy guide basically ruins the feel of Castlevania by telling you exactly where to go and then go there, thus beating the game as fast as you can. It says nothing about 'side-quests', that is, little extras they put in the game. I've clocked in at over 50 hours on this game alone, because the main idea in Castlevania is to EXPLORE and try out new things, not run through, win, and throw the game in the closet. Overall, a disappointment."
4,Winsome Counterstools,"These counterstools were my first purchase from Amazon.com. I am completely satisfied with the product. In addition, I was REALLY impressed with the delivery time. Within two days Fedex delivered my new counterstools. Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Interlink, you fail.","This company is suing Nintendo because of the idea of their Nintendo Wii remote! Just go to any Nintendo forum and see. This company will surely lose, because Nintendo started working on the Wii four years before Interlink filed a patent.Interlink PHAILS!"
1,Not what the title leads one to believe,"This predictable and very boring tale is about an awkward family including a disillusioned movie director, a nonexistant mom, and frustrated son. There is no creepy school, and what you see on the cover is not actually in the book. It is highly implausible and groan-inducing. This book, which had potential, was a big fat mistake."
1,A BADDDDDDDDD BADDDDD BOOK!!!!!!!!11,"THIS BOOK WAS SOOOOOO BORING!!!!!!!I READ TO THE 5TH CHAPTER AND QUIT READING IT! YOU WON'T READ THIS BOOK,UNLESS YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Dope fusion of drum & bass with a classic song,"This is not really a techno song...it would be more appropriately categorized as jungle. No matter though whether you're down with jungle or house or trance or whateva, this song is tight. Beats are hot and the vocalist Lisa May is extraordinary. Excellent song for dancing and love making."
3,massive,"being a jungle lover, I have to admit this is one of the hardesttracks to come by. It sounds better everytime I hear it and love it even more. Big thumbs up,cheers!"
1,Beware printer errors!,"The first time I ordered this book, it was missing several dozen pages, and another whole section was duplicated--obviously a binding error from the printer. I returned the book and explained the problem. When the replacement arrived, it suffered from the exact same problems. My attempts to alert the bookseller to this problem went unheeded. I returned the book for a refund. If someone ever comes out with a printing of this book in which all the pages are present, I'd love to read it. What I could manage to read was interesting."
5,Great Cuban Stuff,"This is one of those albums you NEED to have, as good as the Movie itself, Great Artist Selection, Excellent Music and Great Lyrics,If you want to know about the real Cuba, you need to have this album!!!!"
2,"Italian Flag, or is it?","Wished to get a flag to put up in my room to show my love of the country and culture and thought this product would be a good choice. The size of it was fine (for a smaller flag, not full sized by any means) but I could see through it without any difficulty. At times I questioned whether there was an even a flag or just dust on the wall. Ridiculously thin. Not good at all for decoration or any use at all."
3,Looks like the Irish flag!,"For the price I paid, the quality of the flag is very good. Please keep in mind that this flag will not do well out in the elements. It is made from a thin poly/nylon fabric, and is great for displaying indoors, like on a garage wall. My reason for the three star rating is that the red looks more orange, which is the third color in the Irish flag. Nonetheless,it is proudly displayed along side my American flag."
2,ok,"not a particularly quality product. quite thin and some faint stains. but it arrived promptly. And I didn't pay very much for it, so I am not complaining. If you are looking for a decent quality flag, this is not it. But you aren't paying much either."
3,"Decent flag, many obvious sewing errors","I was hoping to use this as an outdoor flag, unfortunately, it had way too many obvious sewing errors on the seams that seem they would tear on any windy day. I will most likely set this up in the 'man cave', but I wish the quality control was doing there job or maybe the company just doesn't care."
4,Great Porduct Minor Flaws,This product was shipped real quick i loved that but i opened it and it felt a bit cheap but thats understandable it was six bucks then i noticed a little bit of loose seams but easy fix and great product for the price very happy
1,Italian flag was ripped,"Flag was ripped at the seam. It was inexpensive so did not bother to send back, plus did not realize it until it was opened on Christmas morning."
5,A mystical guided tour to Christ through Mary.,Radiant Heart explores the quest for Christ with a perspective from an open heart. Harvey's search has led him through the world's major religions for a profound discovery that we must each undergo a radical transformation by accepting the feminine face of God. These tapes are complete with meditations which guide the listener into a beautiful and sensitive awakening resulting in unexpected healings through the Divine Feminine.
2,Dies just out of warranty,This battery lasted for 13 months while my original OEM battery lasted for years. I wouldn't waste your money on this battery nor mine again. At 70.00 per year this could get crazy real fast.
1,Bracelet Construction,"This bracelet is undoubtedly Italian ""Sterling Silver"".The Italians prepare this with a base metal coated with sterling silver. By our standards this is not Sterling Silver. The ad is misleading and dishonest."
2,Sterling Silver Bracelet,I wanted a sterling silver bracelet and thought this would be fine considering I have small wrists. But it still seemed small and I needed my husbands help to get it on. The color was also not what I expected; it looked too white. I have decided not to purchase jewelry online anymore. I want to see what I buy in person.
5,LOVEEEEEEE IT,"THis product is so awsome, it is light but I was aware of this before I bought it and it;'s sterline silver. I just love it. And it's came in great timing, shiney and in a nice black velvet coated box."
4,Excellent fit and a very nice product,I really like the fit and feel of the bracelet and I always received compliment whenever I wear it.
1,Too light to be solid silver?,"Purchased this as a present, and will return it if we can. It feels generally flimsy and extremely light--as if it were silver-plated plastic rather than solid silver. I suppose there's no way to be sure without destroying it. In any event, it feels ""cheap"" and I would caution you to go elsewhere if you're looking for a nicer-quality gift item."
1,This is NOT sterling silver,I just received this and I am EXTREMELY disappointed. This is NOT sterling silver. It's something painted silver. It is simply too light to be silver. On the clasp I can see that it is painted. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews. This is cheap looking and most likely a gross misrepresentation to say it is sterling silver.
2,Disappointed,I received this bracelet last week to give as a gift to my sister for her birthday and was very disappointed. In person it looks like plastic and it is very light. The quality would be fair if your intention is to purchase a piece of costume jewelry that looks like truly cheap costume jewelry. It is not worth the price.
1,Very disappointing!!!!,I always purchased on Amazon and always got great products.. but this time was different (unfortunately). I bought this bracelet based on the reviews and when I got it I was so disappointed: it look really cheap material. It is bulky which I liked but the material sucks... now i have to find another bracelet for my birthday!
1,"Too light, seems to be plated only, Not worth it! Feels and looks CHEAP!","When handle the size and volume of the jewelry is grossly out of proportion to its weight, its too light.Its probably plated with silver, it feels like a toy, and very cheap.Its marked as 925 Sterling silver, but its just too light its either all hollow or just plated plastic.This grossly being miss-represented."
5,Birthday Gift for a DIVA,What do you gift someone who has everything? This is elegant and delicate at the same time. She loved it and I'm happy that i made the purchase.
5,Beautiful Bracelet,"I bought this as a gift for a family member, and almost kept it for myself! It was very pretty. The clasp is large, but it's also a lot easier to get on that way!"
2,Sent it back,When I received this item I was immediately disappointed. The bracelet is low quality and the spring clasp was defective. I returned it the same day. I'll return to QVC for great jewlery.
4,Good stuff,This product is a little bulkier than what it looks like on the pictures. It still looks great and it seems to be well built. It came in a real fancy box.
5,Love it!!,"I purchased this bracelet as a gift to myself. I love it! I have had it for over a year now and it still looks great and is my go to bracelet for casual or dressy occasions. It is sturdy with a strong clasp. The clasp is large, but goes well with the style of bracelet. My expectations have been and still are completely met."
2,Honeymooners' Lost Episodes,"As an avid fan of this TV series, I already own the original 39 episodes, so I felt I couldn't miss with this DVD. Wow, was I wrong. I realize the footage isn't of the best quality as this was filmed over 50 years ago, so no problem there. The bad part was content. These episodes are nowhere near as funny or entertaining as the original Honeymooners episodes we have all come to know and love. I don't care if all of a sudden 100 episodes were found in someone's vault -- I wouldn't buy them. None of these ""lost episodes"" can stand up to the original 39. Yeah, I love Ralph, Norton, Alice and Trixie and always will, but if I had to do this purchase over again, I wouldn't. Utterly disappointing, so don't waste your hard-earned money."
4,useful but waiting for the new edition,"I found this book is useful for all the cardiology trainee as it is well written, easy to understood and there is many figures. However, it did not mention the new technology in the field of echocardiography such as the tissue doppler, contrast echo. I hope the next edition will include this and the illustrations will be more colorful."
4,CV Anesthesiologist,Well written and easy to understand. Many TTE references are less useful to a beginner in TEE without much TTE experience.
5,Older edition,"Has all the necessary information about echo as long as your not looking to read about 3-D. For the price, its worth it."
4,Great textbook,This is a great textbook for reference purposes as well as a study guide for the registry. The images are great. Each section is well organized and is well written to make understanding things alot easier.
1,Not the best,"This book has always been regarded as the 'bible' of echocardiography. I disagree. Although it is very comprehensive, I have found a few errors (either in formulas or diagrams) throughout the book. This is very disturbing as it should not happen in a book as highly regarded as this. For someone who is learning echocardiography, this book is not written in a way easiest to understand. Often, description are complex and bit around the bush. I had to re-write some parts to make it easier to comprehend. Coupled with the errors found, I have wasted considerable amount of time to make the best of this book. An echocardiography expert could have easily pointed out the errors. For a learner, when the formulas/diagram don't match or make sense, one often spend hours trying to work out why, look up in google etc, only to find that it is an error in the book."
1,Too many words !,"If you prefer to learn echo in a speedy way, this would not be a best option. Too many words without equal amount of pictures to illustrate. I couldn't make details comments to this as I gave up after reading few pages. The others echo books I brought form Amazon are much helpful."
3,Good Stuff From Alabama,"That's right this is where Brother Cane hails from Alabama. After sampling this album I found them to be a cross between the Black Crowes and Guns and Roses. As I mentioned the stuff is good for a debut album, but there are some moments where they start to suck. ""Got No Shame"" is one of those moments, but then again it's because of that blasted harmonica. It makes up for it though with probably my favorite song from them ""Hard Act To Follow"". From there it's hit and miss until ""That Don't Satisfy Me"" the first song I heard from these guys, and it finishes strong with ""Stone's Throw Away"", and the last song. I will definitely sample more of their material to see what else they can do, but for the first album it's good, but there's always room for improvement."
2,Brother Cane,"Good music, Damon Johnson is a incredible guitar player. Johnson's other band, Red Halo is much better."
4,mystical tales,"Howard Schwartz is an extremely prolific story teller, both for children and adults. Gabriel's Palace: Jewish Mystical Folktales is a very good collection of stories involving Jewish mysticism. Many of them are suspenseful and leave you thinking about the true meaning and implications. It is also interesting to compare some of the stories with non Jewish folk tales. I found a number of the stories somewhat dark, but not terrifying. It is interesting to try to determine what reality led to the initial establishment of such ledgends."
4,Mysticism for the People,"Harold Schwartz's collection of mystical tales Gabriel's Palace has a wide reach, culling stories from all over the Jewish world. But it also shows how conservative folk tales are. We can see a pattern in the stories told in this collection: things are not as they seem in the world. A divine mechanism is at work. And only when the main character makes a mistake is this revealed to him or her.So, this collection has nothing new in terms of the form of folk stories. However the especially Jewish content is important, and should inform the reader. The abstruse cosmologies and theosophical speculation of the Jewish mystics are here simplified, and mixed with common folk wisdom. A particular emphasis is placed on gigul, or reincarnation, which is often resorted to in these stories as the ultimate riddle of the fate of the soul.These stories tell the tales of mysticism for regular people. They focus on everyday concerns, even as they pay close attention to matters divine."
5,You would be an alien without this book!,"Because of my work as an interculturalist, I enjoy reading various books on cultural preparation for Americans, et al, going overseas. This book is by far the best quality to prepare a business traveller or even a tourist for life in Japan. It is concise, yet informative, and supplies plenty of pertinent anecdotes which assist the reader in understanding values which we, as Americans, typically find too foreign to comprehend."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Noteworthy","This second novel from Richards is a bit of a disappointment following his excellent debut, ""Throwing the House of the Window."" Richards is again mainly exploring how someone in their late 20s deals with picking their life back up after a traumatic relationship event. Here, however, the main character, Kerry, is female and there isn't the threat of violence lurking. Kerry and her best friend/roommate Marco are fairly engaging characters, the first trying to restart her life, the latter trying not to grow up. Many of the themes and touchstones (London neighbourhoods, drugs, messy relationships, bad jobs, school, dealing with your family) are familiar, and unfortunately Richards fails to add anything particularly new or insightful to the mix. Hornby, Welsh, Amis, Hawes, et al have all trod of various parts of the same territory with far better results. It's not bad, just not all that noteworthy."
5,WOW,This book has great characterisation and like all Richards book brilliantly conjures a real senese of a clubbers London. A Great read and along with all his book a must get !!
3,Basic property research,"Good basic introduction to initial property research in U.S. Describes various historical types of land transfers by state and Federal govenment. Includes British, French, and Spanish transfers prior to acqusition by U.S.The work does not discuss later transfers after initial individual patent or ownership which would be of interest to someone following the history of a single piece of property. For this purpose, a book on using courthouse information would be additional help."
1,Caution!,"I am a heavy Amazon user. I bought this for my haunted house for the kids. Great construction heavy metal housing. It worked for 2 hours, not on continually but intermitting as I bought the extra cord for time delay and duration. The pump failed. I called Amazon and they sent another in 2 days! Thank you Amazon!! The second one work for 2 days total of 5 hours or so, when the pump failed as well. I called American DJ to see if I was doing something wrong.... They had no answer but to return it. FYI I am using the American DJ liquid.. I noticed on the machine that it is Made in P.R.C. - Peoples Republic of China. So much for the company name. I thought I was supporting America. I am exchanging this one in hopes my Halloween Haunted house will be up and running by Halloween. Will post more on the outcome."
1,TERRIBLE USED ONE HALLOWEEN!,We used this last Halloween ONCE then cleaned per manufacturer spec. Stored indoors at 78 degree until Oct. 11 this year; powered up and unit does not produce fog only hums as if pump motor is dead. Contacted customer support via AMERICAN DJ worst case senario I will cut my losses and return to amazon for partial credit. CRAP!
4,Solid Irish instrumentals,"An all-instrumental album featuring some of the new up-and-comers in Ireland's trad scene, including members of Sharon Shannon's band, and the Waterboys. Lunasa shed most of the severity of old-style jigs-and-reels, mixing in a sly melodic bounce without sacrificing their traditional cred. No synthesizers or sampling here, just a creative new approach to the classic Celtic style. The piping, in particular, has a fluidity and expessiveness that's a delight to hear... Even if (like myself) you're not that much into Celtic instrumentals, this might be an album you'd want to check out."
4,One of My 4 Year Old Tonka Nut's Favorite Books.,"Although it's a pretty thin book, it's packed with great illustrations and writing. One of my four year old's favorite books."
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"I recently pulled this CD out for another listen, and almost ten years later from when i first heard it i was still impressed. This is definitely Janet Jackson's best work to date. These songs don't date, which is surprising for pop music, and there is such a wide range of styles here that can cater to many people's tastes. Janet's tracks are funky and upbeat, prompting you do get up and dance or at least bop around. ""Thats the way love goes"" will probably be most familiar, but ""If"", ""What'll I do"", ""Funky Big Band"" and ""Because of Love"" are also noteworthy. There is also the ballads ""Again"" and ""Where are you now"" which are sweet singalongs that would please any pop lover. This may be pop, but its pop done very well. It sets the bar, and basically makes all the recent pop/R&B divas look pale in comparison."
5,Miss Jackson is right on the money with this album!!!,"I love this album. Janet delivers on every track. Four of my favorite songs on this album include If, Where are You Now, The Body that Loves You, and of course, Anytime, Anyplace. Janet clearly exemplifies that she is not afraid to sing about what is on her mind. A must have album. One of my favorites."
5,I love this CD it is a showcase of great talent.,"I love this album. It has sold over 15million copies worldwide. What else can I say. I love how Janet changes her vocals and does all of the background vocals. She can make her voice sound different on just about any song. Especially ""If""."
4,I think this is her best album,"This is my favorite Janet Jackson album. It has the perfect mix of Pop, Dance, and R&B. It also has some of my favorite songs, like If, Again, and Anytime, Anyplace, to name a few. All in all, it's a great album, and to me it's the best example of what she can do."
3,her mood,She got skinny and felt sexy so she wrote this album. Nice romantic songs. But she tries to get into jazz pop or something and it just doesn't work.
1,HORRIBLE,I owned this cd and enjoyed it...but it got so annoying. So annoying that I broke the cd with an axe. Save your money dont waste it on this.
5,This album was cool.,This album is a great album. I like this album a lot it has a lot of good dance tracks on it that makes you wanna dance. Whether if you can or can't dance. And I fall into the catagorie where I can't dance for ...
5,A Successful Merging Of Sensuality With Class!,"This is the blueprint that Janet should've followed with Damita Jo! Sexy but not too blantant and still has the dance hits that she's famous for! I also agree with one reviewer that talks about how people put her down for doing all the sex stuff. While I do agree she's taken it too far, SHE WAS DOING THAT WHEN THIS CAME OUT! Where has these people been?!Anyway, ""Anytime, Anyplace"" was a classic slow jam. Sensual but nothing graphic. The whole album is a gem!"
5,a must have,this is a must have janet jackson cd! if you are a janet fan or jackson fan this is the one!
3,its ok...,"the seller was great, very fast shipping. the album is...uhm...ok. well, my wife actually asked me to get it for her, but she too was disappointed with the songs, considering she liked most of janet jacksons's songs...well, at least the ones we hear the most in fm radios."
4,My Favorite!!!,"This is, by far, my favorite of all of Janet Jackson's CDs!!! Each song conveys so much emotion whether it's love, anger, pain, or desire. There isn't one bad thing I can say about this CD!Stand-out tracks:That's the Way Love GoesIfThe Body that Loves YouAny Time, Any PlaceI feel that this album really and truly brought Janet out of the shadow of her famous brother and made her a bonafide superstar! I would highly suggest buying this album. You won't be disappointed!!!"
5,SOOTHING TO THE SOUL!!!,"Truly a magnificent CD. A wonderful piece of music to relax with and/or meditate. I leave my worries and cares behind me when I listen to it. Mr. Markoe was a true genius of music and composing...sadly he has passed on, but his music lives and lives.......I plan on purchasing all of his CD's eventually! You will love this album and another titled ""Music of the Angels"" I highly recommend both!"
2,Really farfetched nonsense,"I know this ridiculous show well because my family watched it when I was growing up. Vampires, witches, time travel through seances and other ridiculous hokum abounds. Skip it if you're smart. Producer Dan Curtis did better with the Winds of War. A lot better!"
2,Dark Shadows DVD disappointments,"As much as I like Dark Shadows (and I am a BIG fan), I am disappointed in the DVD releases. Having viewed the VHS video releases, I was eagerly awaiting the DVDs. Sadly, after watching two different sets of DVD release number one, I found bad discs in both. Player lock-up and picture skips spoil the fun. I can't recommend Dark Shadows DVD purchases based on the first release. Too many technology ""glitches"" are present. MPI could do much better, and loyal fans deserve more reliability for their repeat business."
5,"We now return to ""Dark Shadows""","Okay, let's just say that dispite the fact that these episodes are over 30 years old, they still seem to have an appeal today, thanks to the timeless gothic pace that was put into the series with the introduction of Barnabas Collins.With effects done with fishing line, paste and glue make-up and the scenes done sometimes in one take, in effect with some actors forgetting their lines, or stumbling across the room, these episodes are in effect as funny as they are scarry.Now that they are on DVD (at a considerablly lower price than the VHS for the same amount of episodes) you can enjoy having mini marathons of episodes. And whether you're watching them because you're a serious fan who has watched the show from the beginning, a fan of one of the actors/actress' in the show (for me it was Alexandra Moltke) a curious newcomer, or whatever, this package is for you."
4,Love the set.....,I really have been enjoying the show on DVD. There is only thing that I wish they had done is put a tag on each show to let you know which # show you were watching last. It's kind of confusing.
5,ENTER THE WORLD OF DARK SHADOWS . . .,"Welcome to the dark and brooding world of Dark Shadows! Jonathan Frid is perfect as the mysterious Barnabas Collins and is effectively supported by a superb cast. The black and white episodes add to its old world feel. The show is just as addictive now as it was back in the 60's when it first came out. Collection 1 is a little slow but hang in there, in Collection 2 the episodes pick up in pace and the story lines become much more interesting. The viewer won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it!"
5,The beginnings of a classic....,"Dark Shadows was a pivotal television series in many ways. It changed the popular perception of the vampire from an evil only monster to an extremely sympathetic and (most importantly) human being. This trend has continued in the works of Anne Rice and countless writers as well as the tv of today as seen in the character of Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. But back to Dark Shadows....this DVD set begins with the introduction of Barnabas Collins, a 175 year old vampire released from his chained coffin by Willie Loomis. Barnabas goes about making himself at home in Collinwood of 1967 and meets a local girl - Maggie Evans - who bears an uncanny resemblance to his long lost love, Josette. He kidnaps her and the fun begins. Truly creepy and literate with an amazing cast. You will not be disappointed."
5,Misleading...,"This DVD is the second season, which was not noted. We still liked it, but were disappointed because we were expecting the first season."
3,none,"not bad for a early vampire series price a little high, liked the character develpment at the start was nice!"
4,down Under in Australia.,"Dark Shadowds b/w soap opera t.v show - takes me back to my child hood racing home to watch,at 12 yrs of age it put chills up my spine.. today its out dated its a comedy,but still holds some magic. its fun, i am enjoying the jorney.."
5,still fun after all these years,"Dark Shadows was the first daytime soap that dared to be different. A romantic drama whose love stories were told in the context of supernatural horror tales, it thrilled and frightened it's young audiences on ABC TV in the 1960s. It's not scary anymore, but it's still a damn good show. Sometimes hampered by a low budget, it's special effects are strictly fun house atmospherics, yet the show rises above it's low budget roots due to some really magnificent writing(the flashback tales to 1795 & 1897 are brilliant) and impressive sets. Jonathan Frid, David Selby, Lara Parker and Grayson Hall are among the many cast members who played their roles with a deliberate mix of camp and utter Shakespearian conviction. They are all perfect for this show. Dark Shadows remains a TV milestone. It is still well worth watching."
2,DISC DOES NOT WORK.,"The first disc did not work. I tried it in two different DVD players and it still didn't work, even though all the other discs worked. I wasn't satisfied. This may not happen to everyone, but I'm just telling my experience. Adivice: Buy it from the Dark Shadows website."
3,Where is the spanish dubbing???,"This series is fabulous. Dark Shadows and specially the acting by Barnabas Collins is supreme. However, I am terribly dissapointed that it does not have the spanish version (dubbing). Specially because the spanish voice of Barnabas Collins added so much creppiness to the show. There is no need of english subtitles as the english pronunciation of all actors is superb, it is like listening to an english lesson.It is a pitty that DVD technology is not used to its full extend when you have the possibility of doing so much more for the show ..."
1,Dark Shadows,"Just wait for the 2012 release of Dark Shadows, the movie, with Johnny Depp. The grainy, skip-over poor excuse for a DVD will surely disappoint you. Low budget in the 70's is definately basement budget now."
3,Silly,"I used to love this show back in the day. Now that I've seen it again after all these years it's very silly. The acting is awful and the lighting is, as well. But if you want a laugh, check it out."
2,"Be forewarned, Collection 1 is NOT the beginning of the series!","For those who believe something entitled Collection 1 should represent the beginning episodes of the series, get set to be very disappointed! This collection begins at episode 210!!. WHY? I have no idea. I was expecting to watch as Victoria climbed off the train at Collinsport. NOPE! Maybe that is on Collection 12 or something!So be careful what you buy. Figuring it will be based on common sense will be wrong when it comes to this product."
1,Is not compatible with all laptops...,"First off, the card works great once you get it to work. But getting it to work may be a challenge.I bought this card for my HP NC6000. Although the guts of this card are identical to the HP card (both made by Intel) found on the HP site, this card will NOT work out of the box with most HP laptops. As it turns out, most laptop manufacturers have their own Intel branded cards and ONLY those cards will work in their laptops (i.e., BIOS will identify the card at bootup and require the card to be removed before finishing booting). There is a workaround for this posted on the HP forum at the HP website that requires some technical expertise, but for those of you that do not want to fool around with re-writing a portion of the ROM on this card, you're probably better off paying the extra amount for a HP labeled card."
1,Common knowledge and easily found information in book form,"Wife is 2/3 of the way through the pregnancy currently. I must be incredibly lucky, we have only used this book maybe 2-3 times. Each time we do, it's useless! She does have back pain, so we look it up. It says to be active (DUH), pillow between legs (EVERYONE says this), stretch (come on!), no pain meds (what moron would do this?!), suggests acupuncture/chiropractic treatment (yeah, sure), and do not use weight lifting belt but suggests pregnancy belt (again, common knowledge). What good does this do me?!I will review this after the pregnancy in case it does prove useful as this book got RAVE reviews... somehow."
4,Gotta Keep Pregnant Women Happy,ANYTHING to help my hubby understand!!!!Nice and easy to read! Quick and simple!
1,Horrible medical advice alert!,"My husband picked up this book for our second pregnancy and we were appalled by the advice that the author gives on managing gestational diabetes. I developed GD in my first pregnancy and was diagnosed as a diabetic following delivery. My treatment now as a diabetic who's pregnant is very carefully monitored and well managed. The recommendations that this so-called doctor gives would put any pregnant woman with diabetes in a coma with lowblood sugars with the diet recommended! I took this book to my OB-GYN, GP, Naturopathic Dr. and endocrinologist and they all said they have had women folow Reiss' diet as diabetics and all have been hospitalized. Lawsuit anyone???"
5,Fashionable & Fabulous!,"These shoes could not be more wonderful! Not only are they sexy, but they are COMFORTABLE!! There are no thin straps to dig into your hard working feet, and the elastic straps are perfect for a hard to fit wide foot! I could not be happier! I highly reccomend them as a welcome addition to your shoe collection."
4,"Fine Product, but not portable like Imiations new product","I agree with the other reviewers who aplauded this product. But there is a Rip-go player from Imation that will do the same things at a slower speed, 4X4X6. It plugs into your PC's USB, burn, and off you go, taking this small unit with you. With the TDK you have to have a seperate player to take to work or play. The Imation Rip-Go is portable, looking like an MP3 player."
5,Comedy soft porn at its best!,"I rented this on video a few years ago with a group of friends, incorrectly titled ""Sex Detective"", and have been searching for it again ever since. I suspected ""Sex Detective"" was not the real name of the film, as it's about a spy, not a detective, but my search was fruitless - until today! I shall be ordering this film on DVD forthwith; it really is very funny and great to watch with a group of mates. The sex scenes are quite soft, but much better and more convincing than in a lot of comedy porn such as those Seduction Company ones. As a Bond spoof it's great; classic scenes include the one in which Rod fights a duel in a brothel using a pair of vibrators which are crossed on the wall, and the scene in which Q gives him a selection of low budget gadgets because his department is running out of money. Quality!"
4,Excellent Parody of James Bond,This is an excellent parody of the James Bond movies. Almost as good as the Peter Sellers bond movie. It manages to mix in the nudity quite well.
1,You've got to be careful...,"...when you do camp for camp's sake. It's really easy to get completely stupid, and that's what this movie is. Agreed, Robert Donovan does a *killer* Sean Connery impression, but it was essentially a one-joke movie, and that joke got kind of tired, kind of quick. I don't usually spend movie time talking on the phone, but I couldn't help it. I was bored, and wanted to let a friend know that John La Zar (Dr. Fez), who played Z-Man in ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" (are you looking for a campy sex-flick? Watch that instead, it's pure genius), was apparently alive and well, and none the worse for the time spent with Russ Meyer. Watch it if you'd like, but make sure you bring knitting, so you've got something to keep you occupied."
1,I really wanted to like this.....NO JOY!!,"I travel a lot and really was looking forward to using this product overseas and to prepare for those long flights. It sounded like a great idea, multiple ways to charge, spare hi-capacity battery, USB charger. Unfortunately, this device failed in all regards.1) the battery would not stay charged more than 1 hour, even if it was charged in the PSP.2) the battery did not fit in the charger, it would only charge when placed in a certain way. The regular PSP battery did not fit in teh charger or charge properly3) the USB cable did not make good connection and would only work part of the time. Other USB cables will had connection issuesIt really had potential, but it failed to live up to is claims. Keep looking and avoid this item."
5,Works perfectly,Bought this at Gamestop about 6 months ago. I leave in the car to power and recharge the psp while driving and use the AC feature in hotels. Battery works perfectly and stays charged for many hours of use. The retracking charge cable keeps out of the way when not in use although I wish they'd made it longer. The charger also has LED indicators on the top to let you know the charging status. When I saw the product in Amazon for $20 I ordered 2 more for about the same price as a single Sony battery.
4,when you're ready to turn it up...,"I've seen the Allstars three times now and this CD really captures their spirit and their strength - shake yer booty and let it all hang out! A warning though, this is the blues, so if you're looking for straight ahead pop/rock, look elsewhere.I'd give it a 5, but truthfully not all the tracks are of 5 star quality. Personally, I prefer RL Burside's vocals to any of the band's, so those tracks are my favourites.If you're in the mood to crank the volume and shake, then this CD will absolutely not disappoint.Yogi"
5,the heartless theme,This album is not one to miss . It includes there best yet singles which have all been hit's in the charts. The three MC's from of course Nouwf London have brought madness to the garage scene with the release of the album . Be sure to buy this it isnt one youre gonna wanna miss.
2,Too weak to develop a serious CMS,"The book, no doubt, presents some useful ideas about creating a content management system. However, the sample application ""developed"" throughout this book is way too weak for a serious system. Many essential areas are not covered in adequate depth, authentication and authorization for one. I found the book and its sample code void of anything exciting on the topic of CMS."
1,Way too simple - a CMS for beginners,"The intro is very nice, explaining some good basics about versioning and workflow. Except for that, the result is a very basic CMS that would require way too much work to adapt.I would say it's a nice place to start for real beginners, but then again, real beginners might as well just download some CMS and adapt it. This book certainly won't help you create a real-world CMS. The resulting CMS has a demo online (ContentMGR), and it looks terrible.BTW: No WYSIWYG editing or similar."
2,Author is a novice,"The books presents a good concept but the final solution is far from adequate for the real world. I can't help but wonder if the author has ever worked in the real world, or does he just write books. I would like to see some real advice not just code listings that can easily be derived from the product documentation."
3,Good info if you can get through it,"This book has good info if you can get past the annoying writing style that Mr. Fraser uses. The first hundred pages are a recap of what a CMS is and you don't get to real ASP.NET and C# until Chapter 9.It does have good examples, however, and building a real application, start to finish is worth the price of the book itself.Don't buy this thinking it will teach you ASP.Net or C#, however, get ""C# and the .Net Platform"" for the later."
2,"Nice introduction to scale of CMS, but that's about it.","Some other reviewers have stated that the code in this book is very weak for any type of large-scale system. I couldn't agree more. While the first several chapters of the book do a good job of explaining the complexity of content management, the second half of the book intends to actually create such a system. The system created is fine for VERY basic sites, but my hunch is that anyone exploring the realm of CMS has a complex enough site to warrant a complex, robust solution. This book creates a basic system, but that's about it. Anyone looking to books for ""real-world"" solutions should find a different book."
1,Content Management System? Are you sure?,"""Building A Content management System"" is a misleading title The example is oversimplified in regards to name, and it is like any sample application that anyone who knows to create tables and knows how to create asp.net pages can think and produce. If you want to learn ASP.NET this book is not that great there are better ones in the market. If you want to learn content management systems and implement one this example is oversimplified and it does not lead you for building a real systemSo i personally suggest keeping your money for a good book on ASP.NET or Content Management System"
5,"Beautiful pictures , useful information",Must have specially when you are first starting out in juicing area.Encourages to try diff recipies by beautiful pictures.
3,"Beautiful book, but major thing missing.","This is a beautiful book because of the great recipes and the beautiful pictures. However, there is one major flaw that makes me give this a lower rating. The book, nor the recipes, ever mention the type of machinery that should be used. The only machine that I can think of is the one she's using on the cover. Otherwise, I have no idea what is the correct machine to use for the recipes. If that kind of information was added to the book, this rating would have been a 5-star rating."
4,Nice Book,"I like this book - I wish it had more smoothie recipes, but I suppose any of them could be considered. I like that they explain the purpose of the various ingredients. I also like the pictures as mentioned in other reviews, although I'd prefer to see more recipes. But, I'm very happy to own this, you'd be too. It's great."
4,Keith at his raw best,"This album sounds more like a collection of rhythm tracks Keith was recording for a Stones album, than a bona fide solo album. It's still great, as it shows Keith in his purest form.The opening track, ""999,"" sounds like an instrumental track with vocals added at the last minute, which give it its edge. The opening chords of ""Wicked As It Seems"" sounds like the Stones' ""Love Is Strong"" in its infant stage. ""Running Too Deep"" is not long enough, and sounds like a rhythm track in need of a guitar solo, but it shows Keith to be the superior rhythm guitar player in rock. ""Will But You Won't"" follows in the same vein.The songs on this album are better than some of Keith's solo offerings with the Stones, aside from ""Happy,"" ""Before They Make Me Run,"" and ""Little T & A."" I can't wait for Keith's next solo effort. How about some recordings from Keith and Ronnie Wood's 70s band, The New Barbarians?"
3,Decent,"Some good stuff is on here. But Keith's albums show why he needs Mick: to add some polish, and make the music not so sloppy. (Mick's solo stuff shows he needs Keith to make Mick's music MORE sloppy, and not so sterile). The Stones are what these guys should be spending all their time on. But since ""Main Offender"" exists, it's worth having, even though you won't love it like you can love the Stones."
4,Some good songs,"No sense in comparing him to the Stones. No musician doing a solo album wants to sound like his signature band. This was just another project Richards did. Looking at it that way, I think it's pretty good. It's not his typical hard driving guitar licks. It's more melodic which I kind of like. The songs ""Eileen"" and Yap yap"" are well written. ""Wicked as it seems"" is more reminiscent of his more typical songs with a strong guitar solo. This seems like a concerted effort and although not his best, I think it still deserves recognition as an interesting, different, and worth owning CD from Kieth Richards, who in my mind IS the Rolling Stones."
2,Kieth Richards having a bad hangover?,"It took ""Talk is Cheap"" a little while to grow on me, but after awhile I loved it, and listened to it about 100 times.Not so with ""Main Offender."" I liked the song ""Wicked as it seems"" but have very little recollection of the other tunes on the album: they were mostly boring and sounded like they were written on a bad hangover and too much aspirin day. The album made me nauseaus. I love Kieth, but this CD makes a good cup coaster for my coffee table. I have a small dog, so it may be a good frisbee to toss around to the little mutt."
2,Bit of a letdown,"There are some good riffs and grooves here, and ""999"" is a standout, but overall it sounds more like songs that were either leftover and undeveloped from the first solo record, or were merely written on the fly in the studio. Some of the songs just go on too long. Still, it's never a bad thing to hear Keef play."
4,Heart felt,"I was talking to a friend who told me about this book. She gave me the website and I ordered the book. She really means what she writes. I felt it as I read through the pages. She will even publish my own poems for free if they're in the category she's accepting. A must read and a site everyone that writes, should check out.It's spreading through chat rooms like a wonderful virus that everyone wants to catch."
5,Perfect food for the desperate soul,It helped me in my spiritual walk deeply. All of the poems were a personal testimony written from God to me through her.
3,"Flex appeal yes, latin rythms no","As another reviewer already said, the Flex appeal was great. I felt that it gave a good introduction and workout. I also found that it really helped my back which has hurt since we moved, probably because it works your front and back and stretches everything out.Latin rhythms really was lacking. Half the time I couldn't tell exactly what they were doing because of the lighting and their clothes. There are much better Latin dance videos out there."
1,Risible Anti-Catholicism,"This book is an anti-Catholic fantasy. It takes a passage in the Book of Revelations, which has nothing to do with Catholicism, and twists it into an incredible anti-Catholic polemic. The ""history"" here is a cartoon. In an organization which has millions of members, you can always find some miscreants. To reduce Catholicism to the crimes of a Lucky Luciano is as absurd as reducing Protestantism to the genocidal policies of Cromwell or as claiming that Bill Clinton---God help us---is a representative of the Southern Baptists.There are serious differences between Catholic and Protestant interpreations of the gospel. Can't we get our facts straight before we debate these differences?"
1,Misrepresentations and Lies about the Catholic Church,"Dave Hunt panders to fundamentalist prophecy buffs, whose biblical exegesis leaves much to be desired. Their history books are published in paperback by preachers whose business cards call them doctors before the ink is dry on their photocopied diplomas. Ah, sarcasm.This book has been exposed by the Christian Research Institute as inconsistent with recorded history. This is easy to confirm because there remain the voices of witnesses both living and dead who testify to the facts who refute Hunt's libelous yammering concerning the events of World War II.And then there are Hunt's comical forays into interpreting the book of Revelation."
1,Bigoted and Ignorant,"This book is merely a laughable example to discredit one of the most positive religions on the planet. Even most Protestants do not believe the filth that this man writes. One person wrote that the Catholic Church is wrong because of its man made hierarchy, which was not man made. The Protestant religions were. Skip it unless you want to be poisoned with hatred"
1,bizarre,"Dave Hunt is filling a need for many people, the need to have something to hate. Anyone remember Louis Farrakhan? Hunt proves with this book that the same kind of hate spreading, blasphemous venom can be found in the ranks of the evangelical and charismatic so-called Christians. He does a great disservice to all genuine Christians by twisting the Bible to fit his own version of ""the truth"". One can only wonder how such a nut found a forum and a following of gullible people to believe in this nonsense."
5,Must Read!!,"Every Christian should read this book. It contains very valuable documentation of the Catholic church and it's early history and ""her"" part in the days to come! LOVINGLY share this book with all your Catholic friends!! I pray God will open eyes!!"
4,Dave exposes her in all of her shamefulness,"This is not the best expose of the nefarious role of the Vatican in affairs past, present, and future, but it is certainly recommended reading. The Catholics hate it, but they love their church more than Jesus Christ"
5,"Extensively well researched, analytical presentation","I was greatly impressed by the clarity of the author's presentation of a wealth of information regarding Catholicism's history and teachings. Wide variety use of original source material, in a highly professional manner. May go over the heads of some, with some complex sentence structure formations and debate progressions, but MUST be regarded as a highly polished work in content. The generation of hate/love reviews clearly speaks to the controversial topic....not a fault in the author's presentation. As a self-considered ""impartial"" audience, I HIGHLY recommend this work WITHOUT RESERVATION."
5,a spiritual eye-opener,"Catholic history is tainted with horrors of lies, theft, murders and persecutions. Now the so-called leader sits on a throne and makes a lot of noise about his speaking without error. I think all christians (and catholics!) should read this book. One underlying point of the book is that all people should beware of the catholic church. For example, the Inquistion was never abolished-it just goes by a different name at present; the reason(s) is obvious. Plot and counterplot, what appears as goodness to the world is that something disguised as an angel of light. How many times in how many places has the catholic church blended the world with the church to get the people to join, and then enslave them in one way or another? I believe Dave has certainly captured the essence and presented it quite well."
1,Misleading,I thought that this was a documentary regarding end times phrophecy. It simply was someone Catholicism bashing. It is a good documentary if you are a hater of Catholicism. It rates a O for end time phrophecy and a O for neutral investigation of end time phrophecy. Pretty sneaky--of someone who thinks Caholicism is.
3,Service,"While the book arrived in excellent shape, it did not arrive as timely as the other book I ordered at the same time. Nevertheless, the waiting time was not inordinate. Appreciate your service. Thank you."
1,Blasphemy at its best. :(,"This book plants seeds of doubt, division, and anger toward Christ's Church. This is blasphemy!The Catholic Church's doctrine is the Truth. Kick and scream all you want. (1 Timothy 3:15)Where is the documentation of the sins and corruptions of other congregations? Oh wait, hide behind your disunity.Mr. Hunt, you may be sincere, but you are sincerely wrong. You are in my prayers! :)"
2,Limited copy function,"Over time, I have purchased four books titled, A Woman Rides the Beast, by Dave Hunt. Recently, I purchased the Kindle version of this book for research purposes. Unfortunately, the copy function is quite limited, which I use to copy and paste the footnotes into the text for quick reference. I also copy words and/or phrases to use in search engines and now that the copy limits have been reached, it is too restrictive to use. So be aware, if you wish to use the copy function of the Kindle. I feel this is information that should be made available before the book is purchased. Had this restriction not been in place, I would have rated it 5 stars."
1,"How can an honest person believe this junk, please...","...consult a historian quickly. Not only that, but how can someone publish such lies. Even the Protestants I run into are embarrassed to see this book in their stores.""To be deep in history is to cease to be Protestant."" - (Anti-Catholic Anglican Priest John Henry Neumann after converting to Catholicism.)Please, anyone out there, study with an honest mind. Read both sides of the argument. You can contact me @ timobrien78@hotmail.com and I can give you recommendations of books that easily refute this garbage.Yours in Christ,Tim O'Brien"
1,IS THERE ANY STAR LOWER THAN 1???,"If you (the reader) are looking for a hate filled book filled with inaccuracies and down right lies, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! But for the sincere seeker of truth, I would highly discourage such a book as this. This book would insult the intelligence of any self respecting person with even a hint of knowledge on what the Catholic Church teaches. But once again, if you are out to fill your mind with hate, lies and all the other things that Dave Hunt, being the fine Christian he is, speaks out of Christian love, than this is YOUR book!"
1,Not The Product of A Sane Mine,This book is filled with all of the typical paranoid and hateful anti-Catholic polemic that pervades fundamentalist thought. Good for a laugh and not worth being taken seriously
3,The Roman Catholic Church,"It was very illuminating, an affirmation of Lord Dalberg - Acton's ""Power tends to corrupt, absolute power corrupts absolutely"" - the Roman Catholic Church has a penchant for violence, we've seen it before, it could happen again."
5,GRUESOME.....BUT TRUE,This book is based on biblical prophecy and thats all there is to it. Any true bible believing christian knows that you can not just take what you like from the bible and everything that tickles society the wrong way can be tossed. There are way too many similarities in the book of Revelations for the Roman Catholic Institution not to be the Harlot that it speaks of. People need to wake up and come out of her. Christ and Christ alone is the only way to get to heaven.
4,Inflamatory language but thought provoking,"In my opinion, a ""must read"" for those of us who are anticipating the return of Christ. Although I found the language a bit more inflamatory than necessary (at times), Mr. Hunt seems to have a lot of points that need to be considered. Even if you are ""pro-Roman Catholic"", you should read this to see what the concerns/fears of some of the Protestant fundamentalists are."
1,Read some history,"For anyone who has the time to get it ""from the horses mouth""... the writings of the Church Fathers begin in the first century A.D. and cover a significant chunk of the first millenium of Christian belief. [...]For anyone prepared to invest the time and effort to read the primary sources with an objective eye, you will see that Christian liturgy, belief, and praxis down the ages has been strangely ""Catholic"". If you agree with Hunt's beliefs, you may not be swayed by the mere fact that history shows them to be utter theological novelties. But you may still wonder why God allowed the ""truth of Protestant fundamentalism"" to be so obscured from the time of Christ until the nineteenth century (in spite of Christ's promises to the Church to the contrary).Don't take my word for it. Don't take Hunt's word for it. Go and read!"
1,Anti-Catholicism at its Worst,Catholic apologists have refuted these arguments. Zondervan bookstores won't even carry this book. Christian Research Institute has blasted it as revisionist history. This is a work that isn't worth the paper its printed on.
1,Hunt writes fanciful polemic against Catholic Church,"Mr. Hunt has taken his anti-Catholic polemics to new heights in his book, ""A Woman Rides the Beast.""Hunt's ravings fail, however, on at least two counts. First, his style is boorish and unimaginative. The thoughtful reader would be better served by Spencer's, ""The Fairye Queen."" Second, his content adds no new insight to the anti-Catholic polemic so common among fundamentalists today.The reader seeking to justify his position that over 1 billion Catholics are really ""sons of Satan"" and that the Catholic Church is bidding an evil plot to take over the world will find no new evidence in this book. He will find a compendium of the best fundamentalism has to hoist at the Catholic Church. After such a pathetic hoist, one must say, ""Hazah!,"" ""Her sides be made of iron!"""
1,AWFUL!,"I couldn't even get through the first few chapters of this book without breaking up laughing. I am a Catholic convert from fundamentalism, and I say whith all my heart that the information in this book IS biased (contrary to the review below). Now, although many of Hunt's sources come exclusively from Catholic authorities, more often than not, their words have been taken entirely out of context. What Hunt has really done is made a total fool out of himself. There needs to be a major clarification regarding the mystery of ""Babylon the Great"" as mentioned in Sacred Scripture. Try reading ""America, The Babylon"" by R.A. Coombes for starters. In closing, I would have to say that this book belongs on the fiction shelf-especially if you're a fan of ""New World Order"" conspiracies. Save this one for a rainy day."
1,A boogeyman book,"This book is yet another way to make money by frightening the fundamentalist Christian (sheep) masses. I have always been fascinated with the venom that Christians ruthlessly attack each other with. Do you think God would hold it against me if I threw up my hands and ignored the lot of them? Do you think God would hold it against me if I shunned church altogether since sadists, theives, liars and child molesters can be found in every denomination of Christianity?Disregard this charlatan and love your brother, no matter what church they go to. I beg you. Incidentally, I have heard people speaking about how close the ""end times"" are my entire life.I'll be 79 next month."
1,Another banal attempt at interpreting scriptures.,"Just another re-write of the same old anti-Catholic non-sense which fundamentalists use to justify their beliefs. I suggest that Mr. Hunt spend more time reading Peter 2:1:20-21, which is not only easier to to understand, but much more appropriate to his beliefs. [20] Understanding this first: That no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. [21] For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost."
4,A Woman Rides the Beast,Lots of information in this documentary. It answered a lot of questions I have as a Christian. A must see.
3,I found it a difficult read.,"Not that it was technical - though some of the catholic specific terminology sent me to the glossary - but rather that I found his writing style a little patronizing. Maybe I feel words like ""obviously"" and ""clearly"" should be used with discretion (the idea being that when something is clear or obvious you don't draw attention to that fact).I would have given up reading but for my interest in topic.In my opinion the author stretches unneccesarily for a few of his closing conclusions, but that is his perogative. It was a tiring read, and I would hesitate to reccomend it to anyone without warning them."
4,Very well researched,The book was very well researched.I am convinced the Catholic church has almost all characteristics of the woman.
1,A Woman Rides the Beast,"I am so saddened to read such misunderstanding about the Church that Christ found, The Catholic Church. Do not believe the lies. As Scripture says, Come and See! See for yourself how beautiful the Catholic faith is. How beautiful the Catholic people are. My heart is heavy to read reviews of praise for a book that is bent on hurting the Bride of Christ, His church, the Catholic Church. Christ died for her. Why would anyone want to persecute her? I will pray for all of you. Read any book by Scott Hahn, Jeff Cavins, Dr.Tim Grey,Steve Ray, Peter Kreeft to have your eyes opend to the Truth. God Bless.A devout Catholic"
1,Typical Hunt,"I am a fundamentalist and do not care for many Catholic beliefs. But, that is no excuse for being dishonest and frankly Hunt is dishonest. I believe James White is much better on this subject matter. Hunt just makes protestants look like a bunch of rambling idiots.I took the book back to library once he started with wild conspiracy theories on the Council of Niacea (the same way oneness pentecostals do) and then played games by transliterating Vicar backward from English to Latin to Greek to get Anti. Which mind you Hunt does not know Greek by his own admission. I came with giberish.These books distract from more serious disagreements and issues between Catholics and Protestants."
1,Now 98% Fact Free!!! Review written by a non-Catholic.,"Boy, Hunt has really done it this time. In this factually absent book, Hunt presents a pathetically flawed arguement that the Roman Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon. The book has already been refuted by top Catholic Apologists.It is obvious to one with even the most elementary knowledge of geography tha the Roman Catholic Church headquarters, the Vatican, DOES NOT sit on 7 hills, it sits on one. Rome, the capital of the nation of Italy, sits on 7 hills.The book of Revelation is very unclear and ambiguous, but I can make a good case to argue that the book of Revelation is all about persecution of Christians in the first and second centuries, and the Whore is actually the ancient Roman Empire which was destroyed in the year 476."
1,Can we give negative stars?,"This book should be called "" 'Hunting' for the Gullible."" Those who believe the rot in this book need a good dose of history to restore their minds to correct thinking. It is not helpful in the least toward creating understanding of Church teachings, but helps buttress what one man wishes the Church taught so that he could feel justified in hating the Catholic Church. Bishop Fulton Sheen once said that perhaps a 100 people hate the Catholic Church for what it teaches, but millions hate it for what they THINK it teaches. Hunt is a case in point. Those who want to read an alternative to Hunt's view of Revelations might consider reading Scott Hahn's new book ""Heaven on Earth"" to get an altogether Biblical view of it without the hate mongering and distortions Hunt presents here."
3,A correction and a sincere apology,"I wrote a review a few hours ago, and only came to realize I made a few careless mistakes. I am sorry about those mistakes and think that it should be rectified. First off, the Salem Witch Hunt was carried by Puritans who were nevertheless Protestants. C.S Lewis chose Protestanism by his own free will, but nonetheless got to know about God through Tolkien. This one wasn't a mistake. It's just that it could have been phrased better to avoid misunderstanding. Once again, my sincere apologies."
1,Hunt is a nut,The man is very hatefull. I think its because he is not Catholic. May God have pitty on him
5,Great Book,A great book well document for who wants to know history if your're faithful Catholic it could hurt your feelings but it's a must read.
5,The truth will set you free.,"Not surprisingly, Catholics who have read this book view it with extreme hostility. How dare anyone question the infallibility of the pope; how dare anyone question the concept of purgatory; how dare anyone question Mary's role as Co-Redeemer; how dare anyone believe solely in the Bible; how dare anyone not support indulgences; how dare anyone remind us of the Inquisition...Thank you, Mr. Hunt for a remarkable book."
1,Stay away from that,"I'm an evangelical who is deeply interested in the evangelical-catholic debate. It is necassary to discuss the agreements and differences between both sides. But in a loving and honest manner! The academic and theological standard of this book is below zero. It's very interesting that Hunt relies heaviliy on a book of Peter de Rosa (without any footnotes!), a former priest and now attacking the church and the whole faith. What a reliable source! Will the real heretics please stand up. If you are interested to get an accurate overview over catholicism read the book of Geisler/Nix and original catholic sources. You can't get any position right if you don't read the original material. This is true for any controversial discussion. Anyone who is judging others in this way will be jugded by god in the same way. If Hunt is right OK., but if not .... This book is fantastic for all catholic haters, but not for a person who is really seeking the truth."
5,Many Catholics will be saved,"I recommend this book if you wish to witness to a Catholic loved one. Hunt makes an excellent case in showing the heresy of Catholism. The Catholic church has murdered christians for hundreds of year, and God will punish her for her wickedness."
4,Makes pain tolerable!,"I developed a TERRIBLE earache tonight (it has been building all evening and began to rage around bedtime). I was in intolerable pain so I drove out at midnight looking for ear drops. I found these and, willing to try anything, bought them for $7! I put the drops in my affected ear about 20 min ago and they have really helped the pain to dissipate. It is no longer a fierce, sharp, stabbing pain but rather a manageable dull mild ache. I'm very grateful to have found these!"
1,Don't buy this product!!,For the past few days i have been having an earache so i got these ear drops thinking they would help. I put them in my ear and it was so cold it made the pain worse. I decided to give it a few minutes and put a cotton ball in. It did NOTHING. I am still in pain and considering seeing my doc because it won't go away.
1,"Yes, don't buy.","I bought this product too...like you said it did NOTHING. Actually it did, it caused nasal discharge, chest congestion, a sore throat, bowel discomfort and excessive saliva production."
5,One of the best,"I have the 1985 hard back edition of this book. It is one of the mainstays in my library. I have been doing bonsai for about 15 years and refer to this book often. The apendices are extremely helpful. They list a large number of trees and shrubs and tell when each should be repotted, wired, fed, pruned, etc. This is a must for anyone who has a variety of different specimens. You just can't remember it all. The pictures are beautiful and helpful for ideas on how to do your bonsai. I'm ordering this copy for my son-in-law who wants to begin the art of bonsai."
5,Very Helpful,"Great detailed instructions on growing, training and styling bonsai maple trees. Excellent pictures and graphics. He covers several different techniques, some I had never seen discussed anywhere else. Good discussion of the general cultural conditions specific to maples. Suitable for any experience level."
1,Dont like,"This book treats the reader as a child. Anyone with any programming experience(including VB), would be better suited reading a book about LISP or Scheme."
2,Seems expensive,Waiting for chains to arrive. Thought they were expensive compared to other chains. Bought them because it said they would fit my ATV. Disappointed by price but hope to be happy with performance.
1,Dubious Value. Two words of advice: Don't bother!,"The title of the book alone is enough to make any normal person sick but as this book came to my attention via SPAM mail, I decided that it also important to warn others.The chapter titles tell you more than you need to know about this book: ""Was She Born This Way?"" ""What He Has Have To Be With Her"" ""What Have You Done For Me Lately?"" ""Lies Women Tell Men"" ""She's Got The Power"" ""The Dating Game"" ""The Sympathy Game"" ""The Suicide Game"" ""Honey, I'm Pregnant"" ""She Loves Me . . . She Loves Me Not"" ""Games Church Women Play"" ""Young Women and Old Fools"" ""Games Women Play on Each Other"" ""Was It Really Worth It?""The author has obviously has had a hard time with the women in his life, is extremely bitter and wants to rally support for his conspiracy theory."
1,A look into the mind of a sick Black man,"Zero Stars! I can't believe that A. Marshall actually took the time to write this junk. I hate to break it to Mr. Marshall, but Black women have been and continue to be, the backbone of the Black community. It sounds like Mr. Marshall is a tad jealous of Black women. After all, we have a better reputation in America. This book just gives Black men an excuse to not deal with their own humiliation and limitations. Instead it suggests that they kick the #$*! out of Black women.I am assuming that Mr. Marshall's mother was A Black woman.Don't waste your money."
1,PURE 1000% TRASH!!!,"This book is a huge disappointment and disrespectful to the black community. This book deserves NO stars!!! It is nothing but nonsense and not worth the paper that it was printed on!What's next? ""1001 Ways to Rape a Woman without Even Trying""? Wake up my, Brother. Wake UP!"
1,Typical and pitiful!,"Alan Marshall shines as yet another example of why we should KEEP ABORTION LEGAL! He could have been easily eliminated if his mother had taken the time to think about her awful decision to birth this so called ""black man""!Here we have yet another book about whining, paranoid black men spouting the gospel about a whole group of women as if it represents all black women. How pitiful! And a publisher decided actually decided to publish this garbage! Thank goodness I did not actually buy it. A black guy I know purchased it for his reading group. I think he has subsequently BURNED IT!Maybe Mr. Marshall should look inward to see if he is attracting these type of women based on his own nasty, obtuse personality. Remember, YOU ATTRACT WHO YOU ARE!Well I can only hope that if he offers more of this ludicrous outlook to the universe he will finally reap what he sows. And finally if you are reading this Mr. Marshall, do us all a favor and DO NOT PROCREATE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!"
2,Misleading Description,"I bought this product because it has a picture of the sunglasses and the name of the sunglasses. I ended up getting only the lenses (also in the description), but absolutely not clear enough. I returned the lenses, and they didn't charge me a restocking fee."
5,Great book for toddler,"Toddler loves this book and know repeats the catch phrase ""I can do it too"" as well as points out the child's mistakes in the book. Great read!"
1,idiotic,This is a horribly biased film with an obvious agenda to make people sympathize with terrorists (not the innocent Palestinians) and condemn innocent Israelis (not the Israeli Army). A far cry from a fair documentary and there are several better titles if you're looking for real education on this issue.
1,horribly biased film,This is a horribly biased film with an obvious agenda to make people sympathize with terrorists (not the innocent Palestinians) and condemn innocent Israelis (not the Israeli Army). A far cry from a fair documentary and there are several better titles if you're looking for real education on this issue.
2,There's usually two sides to every story...,"This film is, above all, biased. This is not to say it's wrong, or even bad, but it indeed is propaganda. Now, it is true that Israel has made mistakes--many, perhaps--in this situation. However, the film takes only the Palestinian side and forgets some key facts...perhaps they could've mentioned, the day after the State of Israel was created, 5 armies from neighboring Arab states invaded, intending to destroy the new country. But that was in 1948. They could've mentioned too, though, how, in retaliation for their plights, the well-supported suicide bombers went into Israeli restaurants, schools, and places of worship, with explosives packed with nails strapped to them, intending to kill as many innocent civilians as possible. This would've put the film into context, but, as was said before, it's trying to sell the Palestinian side."
5,FASCISM BY ANY OTHER NAME,This film is an excellent introduction to the history of the Palestine Israeli struggle. It is the historical information that most United States citizens are unfamiliar with that ultimately determines where justice lies (just as it did in South Africa and in the American south) and makes the current situation so obviously fascist. This must stand as basic essential information and arguments over details can only be secondary. This should be shown in every high school in America. Bush's rhetoric about honoring UN resolutions is also shown to be just so much more deceit from the US leadership...
4,A Strong Follow-Up to Jouney to the One,This is an eclectic session with a few misfires. I you like Journey to the One you'll like this one.
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"For the money that you pay for this kit, I am somewhat disappointed. I definitely could have found the same quality at Target for much less."
3,RED 2 Review,RED 2: Not as lasting as originally expected but basically satisfactory. Packaging of product(unwraped with barcode obliterated) raised questions as to wheather I was really receiving a genuine item; this was our first purchase of an on-line perfume offer and we were not familiar with the condition of the product
2,packaging,I do not like the way your books are packaged. It is very hard to remove the book. It is so tight that I cut the book protecter in trying to remove the book.
4,Ceiling Medallion Review,"Wow, these are awesome medallion. The pattern is intricate and the quality is stellar. They look great under my ceiling fans on the porch and add just the right touch of flair."
5,Perfect and affordable,I bought a chandelier from The Gallery and this medallion works perfect. It covered the ceiling imperfections that the chandelier cover could not. It was also an awesome deal and looks expensive. Highly recommended!
3,I was warned...,It's really really really white! I was warned. The ads say it can be painted. I didn't. Now I regret it. Why? It's really really really WHITE!
4,Warming to God While Clowning Around,"Nouwen is always warm and genuine in his relationahip to God. He reflects on our own foolishness in Christ. He loosely relates chastity to everyday life, broadly defining it. He demonstrates our poverty and it's usefulness in maintaining our simplicity. And we must always submit ourselves to one another in obedience. If you like Nouwen, you'll like this book. It's an easy read, though penetrates through the veil of modernity."
2,Not great,"Keith has had some very strong solo efforts..this one wasn't! Can anybody say ""I miss Mick""! The CD just seemed a little lost to me."
4,This video characterizes a fan's love for the Pack!,"Connie Gomper is a true Packer fan, in every sense of the word! The video is approximately 20 minutes long and describes Connie's determination to have Robert Brooks on her television show, which is produced in her garage across from Lambeau Field. She chases Coach Holgrem to give him unsolicited advice, and begs Brooks to be on her show. The film showcases other Packer diehards like Mel Kenoke, of the Packer Hall of Fame. The story is lighthearted and funny, as it characterizes true Wisconsin sincerity and commitment ot the Pack."
3,OK,Had many songs but not all of the ones I would have preferred. I grew up hearing a lot of Charlie Pride but when I listened to this specific CD there weren't as many known titles as I thought. Many of the songs were very good though.
4,Simple and unpretentious,"What I like best about this book is its modesty. It is not showy in any way, just clean and honest. It does not emphasize the horror or the cynicism, as most other Vietnam novels do. The book is more about camaderie, and it retains a little of the idealism that so many people felt at the time. I have read this book four times or so, and I would recommend it as an introductory novel, not only for its quality, but also for its brevity. The author evidently had second thoughts about this novel, since the text of the paperback edition differs from the hardcover. I am not sure how extensive the changes he made were, however the hardcover's ending is upbeat, the softcover's just the opposite."
2,not very good,"Being a huge morrissey fan, i was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, it was not a good pick. There is some information that was new, but mostly it was uninteresting and boring to follow. I do not reccomend this book. Try another Moz book!"
1,"a sad, sad man","Any author who prints his own review in response to perceived ""attacks"" from his audience has completely lost objectivity. I haven't read the book, I will not buy the book, and I do hope the author will consider another career. To insult an artist's fan base makes me wonder why the author felt so strongly about his subject to dedicate the time to complete a book. Reader meet author, indeed. ""Pasty-faced geeks who look like a good feed would kill them, bespectacled freaks who try to look like him and who are only truly happy when they are ill. Young men who swear they are straight, but go home and masturbate to the sound of The Smiths."" I, by the way, am none of the above. Screwball."
3,Good Read,"#4 in the Code of the West series.McAllister amazes me. She can really set a scene, whether it's the glitzy jet set in New York City or the small town western in Montana. And her characters are equally vivid and easy to care about. This romance between a widowed school teacher and a divorced cowboy is a perfect example. Rodeo is not something that interests me, but in reading this, I was completely engrossed. I was actually tense at the end, right there with Felicity as she struggled through. I felt like I took the class, too.There are no plot twists, and the tone is quiet. But there were lots of secondary characters lending support. And there was plenty of humor, in the first half of the book, at least.Enjoy."
3,Not the complete first season.,Great show but mistakenly I though this was the complete first season. I was in a hurry and didn't pay attention so hope this helps you.
2,Pass It Up,"As an avid viewer of the Honeymooners, I'm finding out that NOTHING compares to the original 30+ episodes. Was very disappointed in this as the quality is not that great (I realize the film is over 50 years old), and hence, the sound isn't the best. But, more importantly, these episodes just aren't that funny. I would not purchase any more ""lost"" episodes."""
2,CUTE LOOKING SHOES BUT NOT VERY COMFORTABLE,"I ORDERED THESE SHOES IN BLUE AND THEY ARE VERY NICE AND MATCH DENIM PERFECTLY. I HAVE 6 PAIRS OF EASY SPIRIT SHOES THAT ARE VERY COMFORTABLE, THESE ARE NOT ONE OF THEM!!! I LOVE THE TRAVELTIME SHOES FROM EASY SPIRIT. THE OTTUSO ARE MUCH MORE NARROW FITTING AND NOT A GREAT SUPPORT ON THE HEEL. I DECIDED TO TAKE THE INSOLE OUT OF ONE OF MY OTHER EASY SPIRT SHOES AND THEY FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER. I'M GOING TO KEEP THESE SHOES BECAUSE I LOVE THE WAY THEY LOOK, I JUST HOPE I CAN BREAK THEM IN AND THAT THEY GET A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE!"
1,Not all what it looks like.,When I read the prodcut description I undestood that this would fit well on my Harley XL883L. But I was disappointed when I saw that the product really consisted on only the end bits and I would need to replace the existing throttles to fit the Throttle Boss.
4,Que bueno pedo es este CD,"Este CD esta muy bien. Tengo varios años en EEUU y no he sabido mucho del Rock de mi tierra, Mexico pero opino que si te gusta el rock y en tiendes muy bien el ""mexicano"" lo disfrutaras"
3,Blah blah blah,"The bonus tracks on this disc are as follows[6-9 Japan Only Bonustrack]6. 10,000 Miles Away7. Hooligan's Holiday (Extended Holiday Version)8. Hammered (Demo)9. Livin' In The No (Demo)As the one reviewer says buy the Music To Crash Your Car To Box set and get these songs remasterd. It is a much better buy and you get a great holder."
5,Excellent Sandal!!!,"I had heard that Keen shoes were comfortable and worth the money, and after buying this sandal I am a true believer! I have flat feet and have trouble finding a shoe that is comfortable. I have worn these sandals all summer long. Many people have asked me where I got them, and I have been a walking advertisement for Keen. I am now online looking to buy a couple more pairs of Keen shoes. You will not be dissapointed if you purchase these sandals!"
3,Norwegian guys make untypical ambient album,"Drum Island are three Norwegians who made a fairly good beat-driven ambient album, with this, their only album as yet.Their music is best described as ambient music with beats with a strong influence of bossa nova and tropico thrown in. Similar to Thievery Corporation, but a bit more underground, less commercial and without the faux-reggae element.At times it can sound like your standard lounge album and that is why I give it 3 stars instead of 4. But there is enough elsewhere on this album to warrant a listen. Not your typical ambient album by any means."
1,CD-R,"I paid a premium price for a CD music that is a ""legal"" copy. The CD is not professionally manufactured. I really wanted the original CD. If I would have wanted a CD-R, I would have made my own copy of this album."
3,description,"DetailsABC News correspondent John Stossel investigates America's tendency to blame misfortunes on others. From three different angles the ""victim mentality"" is explored in order to attempt to answer the question: Why should we accept responsibility for what happens to us?"
3,A good introduction,"The authors begin with the basics -- the difference between ""nobility"" and ""aristocracy"" and the essential prerequisite to both: ""the right to be called a gentleman."" They move on to a thoughtful historical analysis of the British sort of aristocracy, including its manifestations in Scotland and Ireland, and the development of the aristocratic character and end with its place (if any) in the modern world. Of particular interest are the chapters on two rogue subgroups -- the great landowning families who are nevertheless untitled commoners and those military or professional middle-class families who achieved titles without possessing much acreage. The unannotated bibliography is a useful starting point for further reading. All in all, a well-informed and well-written treatment by two blokes with hyphenated names."
5,this might be my favorite!,"I love this book! It is fun to read, has great literary rhythm and the artwork is classic! When the children are at the seashore, you can practically smell the sea and feel the wind in your hair. I babysit my 2 year old niece every couple of weeks and whether I choose or she does, we always read this book. Sometimes several times..."
5,It does fit,"This saw works great on our Cub Cadet 4 cycle trimmer.Mounts, connects, and disconnects easy. Just loosen the clamp on the shaft, pull the trimmer head off and put the pole saw on.We were not sure it would fit our particular trimmer but it probably will work on many models. They could sell many more if a list of the types of trimmers it will fit was available.Troy-Bilt 8-Inch Pole Saw Attachment #PS720"
4,Works as promised.,Bought this to help clean some of the tree branches in my back yard. Pretty much filled the reservoir with oil and off she went. I have a four stroke weed trimmer and it hooked right up without any issues; one thing that was not mentioned in the instructions is you have to run the weed trimmer at full throttle before the blade will start to run. Chewed through a four inch thick branch in about 3 minutes. I highly recommend adjusting the handle on the weed trimmer if you plan to use the attachment or it will seem very unbalanced. As with any power tool make sure to read the safety guidelines and wear eye protection.
2,Reteire person,Used one time after trimming about 6 branches it quit cutting. Called Mfgr to try to get new chain and found that impossible. Took it to chain saw sharpening place (on listed as suporting dealer) but they said the could not replace or sharpen the chain. They also denied being a service provider of this product. ?????? Still need it but it don't cut.
2,Trimmer Plus PS 720 Add-On Pole Saw,This was not the product that was advesetized. I wanted the TroyBilt PS 720 Add-On Pole Saw which is a better and more durable pole. The Trimmer plus is made of more plastic and not as good quality as the the TroyBilt. This product is a cheap invitation.TrimmerPlus PS720 Add-On Pole Saw. The TroyBilt brand is what I wanted.[[ASIN:B0007MGCSU TrimmerPlus PS720 Add-On Pole Saw
1,Bar no longer available,Machine ok but bar no longer available so if you bend it of need to replace it you have to buy a full new head.
2,Incomplete Item,"I should have taken the word ""attachment"" a lot more seriously! I assumed that if I ordered this gadget, it would be complete so I could start using it immediately. Not so. On receipt I found out I had to own a troy-Bilt trimmer, which this attaches to. My annoyance is that nowhere in the descriptions is the need for the other item ($50)made CLEAR. It may be a great gadget, I still haven't been able to try it."
3,"Good Cleaner, different case!!!",I had no shipping issues and the end product was great. The one problem I did have was the case was not the one in the picture big dissapointment!!! The case ended up being closed by velcro not a zipper.
4,Boresnake is great,The boresnake works great and is much easier than the usual alternative. I am not particularly a fan of the spray-on solvent though. Probably better off just buying the supplies and snake separately.
5,"Super fast, super effective.",One or two swipes with this works like a charm. I've used this on a few somewhat neglected firearms and it has done a wonderful job of cleaning and oiling with hardly any time spent.
1,This book should never be use at a university level,I have finished a 314 level class at OSU for my Spanish minor using this book and I hated it all the time. I am Latino and live in Centro America for many years. This book over generalized many too many things and romanticized many others. It sacrificed too many details and it kept on saying Hispanic too many times. This book is from a point of view from an outsider who does not seem to understand the rich and divorce Latino culture.I do not recommend this book for anyone to read if they hope to learn something.
3,Super Reader,"This is your standard boy meets girl, girl gets incinerated by vampire father for breeding a super supernatural story. With a fun siege scene, and a sneaky statue. While 300 pages, not very dense at all, it won't take you long."
3,Nothing fancy,"Was disappointed with this book. I really wanted to see a continuation of the first story line and not a rehash of what we already know for the most part. More of the history of the vampires and wolves would have been a great addition to the story, yet nothing was expanded upon in this area. There were some new characters but the main story seemed to revolve around Lucian and Sonja. We already know what happened with them. This just gives slightly more detail.If you're a fan of underworld I'd say give it a read or if you're bored and just like vamps and wolves in general it is ok for something to do. Just don't expect much more out of it than the first."
5,Underworld Blood Enemy greg cox,"Blood Enemy ( Underworld, Book 2)As a senior citizen there are not many vampire or si-fi I have not read. I do admit to being a novice at reviews as I spend most of the time reading or writing for myself. Mouser I hate to worry you but I could not state your were any more wrong about Greg Cox's writing.. I was glued to this book from start to finish and that is a rarity for me, I usually read 3 or 4 books at the same time. I can only pray that if they make this movie they use the same Lucian they used in movie 1.This is Lucian and Sonja's love story and very well written I might add. Cox hops from now to then but I must admit he is very good at it.. My favorite instructor told me once before you can break the rules you have to know the rules. Cox has them down pat, I only hope we have another sequel.Starseed"
5,Action packed love story,"For the most part the book follows the storyline set forth in the second movie, but the book also includes far more material than depicted in the film. The first 150 pages are dedicated to almost nonstop action. Battle after battle will have the story flying by at a good clip. When the action settles down the romance begins and the author lays out the story between Lucian and an Elders daughter. Of course in the end the love story ends poorly for the two, but no good deed goes unpunished.The book is an easy read and well written. There are some parts I would have preferred to have been different like the over use of Old English in the begging of the book, it just felt odd and over done. But all together I liked the book and given that it is the only book that isn't a direct novelization of one of the films, it is the only literary installment to offer more to the larger franchise."
3,Good viewing torpedoed by disk problems,"I too ordered the five disk set, watching a few episodes and then put in disk one - it didn't play. Returned the set immediately and in rapid fashion received another set with still another faulty disk one. Waiting for now . . .Good customer service, great show, but all for naught if four of thirteen episodes cannot be watched."
5,Excellent product,"Starring the Sherlock Holmes of this generation, it is well worth the money. Get the complete series."
1,Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"The originals as aired on PBS ""Mystery"" were supurb, but the first episodes in this boxed set, the ones contained on thedouble sided DVD, had an abysmal sound track. It sounded like a badly looped 16 mm sound film. I returned the set as defective, but the replacement was the same. I returned it for a refund. I then communicated with MPI Communications about this and found they were aware of the problem but had no idea of when a fix was due.I will buy this set again if it ever gets remastered properly.I hope they identify the remaster as such so we'll know it."
5,If you don't have it ...,you don't have rights to call yourself a sherlock holmes fan :)its a cherishable collection
5,"The greatest, but...","Yes, this is one of the finest television productions you will ever see. And the first thirteen programs are arguably the best in the series. ""The Solitary Cyclist,"" ""The Speckled Band,"" and ""The Copper Beeches"" [misspelled ""Beaches"" on the box) are absolutely marvelous. But the buyer should beware, for ""The Greek Interpreter"" is incoherent. My guess is that several crucial minutes were eliminated at some point, perhaps in the movement to DVD. In any case, this very flawed production mars an otherwise superb set of Holmes mysteries."
3,Excellent series but really lousy subtitles !!,"the work by Granada is excellent , the subtitling that was made by MPI Media Group though is really bad. When Sherlock Holmes speaks very softly , they simply put the caption ""unintelligible""I only checked the subtitles in two stories after which I became disgusted by the lack of professionalism.In the Final Problem, when the museum director refers to ""the Roi Soleil"" , it is translated as ""the Musele"".In the same episode, when Sherlock Holmes refers to the ""great Bertillon"" it is translated as ""great Bantion""In the Red Headed League, a reference to Gustave Flaubert is rendered as Gusta Label.In the same episode, ""a small brougham"" becomes ""a small broom"" .Still in the same episode, the state of Luxemburg becomes Luxemberg.This is all the more unacceptable as fixing the erroneous parts of the subtitles would have been so easy.....Refer to the book !!! Granada uses the book almost word for word."
5,Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"For those fans of the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, this is the most in depth retelling to date. The detail, breadth of scope in production and downright excellent acting (Jeremy Brett as Sherlock), you will be taken to another time with a slow pace and delightful mystery. Brett is the consumate Holmes with a character bordering on the obsessive. Lighting and music are equally fitting. Highly recommended."
2,Spooky Atmosphere Ruined by Gratuitous Violence,"Well-acted, eerie atmosphere, BBC-style British television spooker is all set to be near-perfect, of a quality right up there with The Changeling or the Woman In Black. But some viewers may be turned off by the relentless torturing of animals that the two kids get up to - far more so than the barely hinted at suggestions in The Innocents film version of this great Henry James story. I found this aspect spoiled what could have easily been otherwise an above-average haunted house movie relying on psychological chills in the best tradition of The Haunting."
1,Be warned: Poor audio!,"MPI's DVD edition of this video feature has serious audio problems: the dialogue is distorted and impossible to make out, like a radio with very poor reception. (MPI made a similar mess of their DVD version of 1973's ""Picture of Dorian Gray"")."
2,know what you're buying,"this is not a retail product. it arrived in a clear plastic bag and the ball was completely deflated.if it's just for you, then i guess it doesn't matter but this is not a gift item at all.packaging aside, the grip surface is glossier than those you'd find a retail shop and lacks the tack of a new ball."
4,"Powerful, Portable but Noisy","Another excellent product from Panasonic! It's lightweigth and has a great lamp (2000 lumens for under $1k!). My only concern has to do exactly with what I was looking for in a projector: a powerful lamp. Because it is so powerful it has to have an equally powerful cooling solution. And thus the fan. Two noisy fans, actually.I think Panasonic should have to start looking into liquid cooling solutions...Anyway, great product and a great store: fast and reliable."
4,"Good, but not hilarious","I bought the First Season of ""One foot in the Grave"" based on words like ""best ever"", ""very funny"", etc.The First season collection is pleasant to watch, but is not hilarious. Some situations are a bit contrived, as is the snake incident, and for other, my expectations based on review by others may have been too high, as was the vacuum cleaner ""duel"". Many situations could be funnier, but were lost by Wilson's (Victor) delivery.It is not the ""best ever"" British comedy.Based on the reviews, I understand subsequent seasons are better.As in the past, Amazon gets 5 stars for excellence in all aspects of the purchase."
1,didn't work,The DVD didn't work. I don't know if it was because there was nothing on the DVD or whether it was the wrong formatting. I tried it on two different devices and it didn't run on either one. I bought it with a gift card so I didn't bother sending it back.
4,one foot in the grave,"I had watched this show in the 90,s when it was aired thought it was hilarious. Poor Victor Meldrew is retired early & has to figure out what to do with himself & he sure does getting into all kinds of trouble.Light hearted comedy you will love.JBlomker"
4,Hilarious brittish comedy!,"If you enjoy Brittish comedy (generally drier) you will love this show! Full of sarcasm and satire, the writers are fantastic, and the acting is great!"
3,Ok,"I watched this on TV. It has a little humour, but I couldn't get into it. Different things please different people, but this was just OK. It was lightly entertaining, but not the best comedy shows I have ever watched. If you are bored I would recommend watching this if there is nothing else to watch. Not bad, but not for me."
5,One Foot in the Grave,I love One Foot in the Grave and had never seen Season 1 on PBS until I bought it. I can watch this series over and over again and laugh out loud. The acting is great.
1,Meet Mr. Meldrew,"I can enthusiastically recommend One Foot in the Grave, Season 1. Newly unemployed Victor experiences everything from hand grenades to escaped snakes. This is a wonderful introduction to a very funny series. This is the second Season 1 I purchased from Amazon. The first did not play, but I returned it and quickly ordered another, which was just fine. Returns are very easy with Amazon."
1,I HATE THIS CD IT A PIECE OF GARBAGE,it is the most horrible CD I have ever heard and one of the songs is a whole 20 minutes don't waste your money on this piece of garbage you and your friends will hate it believe me
2,Disappointing,Very well but selectively researched. I was disappointed by the obvious sympathies to a group of people that comitted the most henous act of genocide in history.Over bloated and irrelevant in places. Don't bother.
2,Didn't like it,"Book based on ""Ifs"", ""Could have happened"", ""Must have happened"", ""Can't be trusted"", an so on, but no definite facts. Really, based on no facts at all. I've got the impression that the authors want to show a ""loving"" Lenin, stating that he wasn't involved in the massacre of the whole family, failing to explain from which documents they arrive to such conclusion. I highly regret having bought the book. It is not serious at all."
1,Please explain?.,"Like other sentimental books on the Romanovs the authors of this one fail to tell the reader why they should care what fate befell Russia's ruling dynasty?, the last in a long and undistinguished line of despotic parasites who kept generations of Russians poor, uneducated, imprisoned and deprived of basic democratic rights to maintain the imperial power and lavish Cinderella lifestyle we so marvel at today. The Russian people were as well rid of the Romanovs as the Iraqi people are the Husseins, so what next a tear jerker on how the Hussein family fled their palaces and plunder as our liberating troops advanced, their last tearful embrace before our troops slaughtered them?. The only difference between the Romanovs & Husseins is a crown, both dynasties left an equally negative legacy behind."
1,The Fate of the Adverbs,"Mark Twain said, ""I have an aversion for adverbs. I will not take adverbs from a stranger."" I agree. The Fate of the Romanovs is propelled by adverbs and, as a result, is hopelessly overwritten and under-convincing. I suppose the authors should be commended for attempting to make their account read more like fiction, but so does Snoopy each time he begins with, ""it was a dark and stormy night."" The book (and, suspiciously, even some of the reviews) are ""wrought"" with hyperbole--as if the authors looked to Roget repeatedly for new ways to write, ""threatening."" Their perpetual dramatization makes it difficult to ferret out their research or the facts. I surrendered."
2,THE FATE OF THE ROMANOVS,"The best researched work on the subject matter by Greg King and Penny Wilson who not only did exhaustive research in the USA in preparation for writing the book, but also traveled to the sites in Russia where the action took place digging in archives never before viewed by other researchers. Time travel at its best! Unlike most authors Penny Wilson is a researcher who reads, writes and speaks the Russian language."
1,"""National Enquirer"" history","Sorry - this is just a semi-imaginative rehash of all the long histories on this subject we've seen so many times before - only this time, an added dash of ridiculous speculation and make-believe suppositions. Strictly for the Ekatrinburg groupies who devour any ""new"" info as they do their evening meals. As always, King's writing skills make one truly appreciate the consummate artistry of Barbara Cartland. How come the publisher didn't put bare chests and ripped bodices on the book cover like the other romance novels have? Hmmm . . ."
1,Not what it claims to be,1. the photos which were claimed to be new and never seen before have been around since at least the 60s.2. two authors should have co-ordinated.3. contradictions to their own findings thruout.Sad to say many Romanovphiles see this as the ultimate book on the murder.
4,Conditioning for Figure Skating,This book was so good from the library I wanted my own copy so that I could dog ear the pages and make sure I stay on track to get my skating to the level it can be to be great!
4,Fling Is Fast Paced And Sexy,"Fling is a movie about a young sexy couple who believe that they can have an open relationship and jump in and out of bed with others at whim. She begins to fall in love with a former boyfriend. He, on the other hand, is obsessed with lust and sex and wants to bed any girl he can. Their relationship is stretched to the breaking point and eventually something has to give. Will they survive their lifestyle? This movie sexually teases you from beginning to end. Excellent performance by Steve Sandvoss and Courtney Ford. Brandon Routh also turns in an excellent performance.The movie is worth seeing. You won't be bored. It is fast-paced sexual tease all the way through."
3,fling excitement at this film,A movie that explores modern relationships between those now in their twenties. The idea of an open relationship might seem weird or unnatural to some and the movie explores this notion and tries to show the reasoning behind being in an open relationship.
3,Fling,"Pretty good movie, decent acting, I'm always amazed at how natural some inexperienced actors are, none of the leads have done that much, yet seemed very believable in their respective rolls."
5,An old family favorite,"The Little Bear books have been around for many years. They have a very simple message of love and acceptance.They were favorites of my daughter at bedtime. When she learned she was expecting, she ASKED me for those books. All children love Little Bear."
5,"Heartwarming, charming, what a great book, and at a great value too.","The little bear stories are one of my son's absolute favorites. It is a shame the cartoon is no longer on the air, as I'm sure he'd love that too, but the books are adorable and heartwarming as well. My son loves reading these books, and its really a joy to read this to him and see the expression of delight on his face. Really a great book for your kids."
4,Excellent book for beginners.,"This is a great book for beginners of Linux OS (Red Hat Version). The format is a simplified step by step howto on the basics of ""using"" the OS & system utilities. This book can shave months off the Linux learning curve. It does not have all the detailed answers, but can point you in the right direction of where to start looking in the ""free"" HOWTOS off the internet & cdroms (i.e. you can't find an answer if you don't know the question). Problems with other books are ""too much or too little"" info to get started. This book aims to give just the right amount of information. I believe there is NO one perfect book on Linux OR Unix period. The only problem I have with this book is that I wish it were published when I first started ""Using Linux""."
3,An excellent FAQ book,"It's probably no the best book about Linux, and quite expensive when read its content, but if you are looking for a book from where get a quick answer to usual and simple questions (how mount a flopply, how change X windows server, using tar command .... ), that's your book."
5,Must have for beginning/intermediate users,"If you are a new/intermediate user of Red Hat Linux this is a must have book. My favorite thing about this book is that it covers in simple step-by-step fashion many of the things you want to do with Linux. I keep this book with in arms reach of my systems as it servers as a great reference as well as a tutorial. It is not a ""complete"" reference, but then again a ""complete"" Linux reference could not have the detail this book has. The book is very focused on Red Hat Linux, and if that is not the distribution you are using, you might find that aspect would turn you off to this book."
2,Some sections incomplete,"Some sections, settting PPP connections for example, are incomplete with essential steps missing. In this example, when does one create the ppp-on-dialer script?"
3,Goddaay-um!!,"OK, first thing's first : This book is for those of you that haven't seen a computer in all of your live. period. Being new to linux I wandered into a bookstore and wound up buying this book. On the back it seems it bo a rather nice reference for beginneintermediate user. Nice, maybe..reference , hardly. In the first line of the foreword it says, ""..this is the ideal book for Red Hat users..."" Since I am using Slackware I was not very pleased. The back of the book said nothing about being version - independent. A large part of the book is about red hat package management and RedHat X-Windows utilites. Definently NOT an all-round Linux book. Don't buy it..even if you're a RedHat user."
3,About the average Linux book,"It covers broad topics about redhat nevertheless it is not the best book to read, nor is it very self-explanatory."
3,"Useful, but not comprehensive","Mainly, for those who already have linux up and running, you get some information on some of the different programs and utilities available for linux, but it wasn't as complete as I would like it to be."
3,"Useful, but not comprehensive","This book was decent. With all of the new LINUX OSes coming out, this book was too old. This book was very vague. But if a 14 year old can do it YOU CAN ALSO"
1,This book stunk,I'm sorry but this book stunk terribly. I would not recommend it for anyone. It obviously shows the author has no idea what Linux is.
3,What's on it,"Dead Man's Hills: While delivering food and medicine to the sheriff, Dale is drawn into a fierce stand-off with outlaws.Jailbreak: A young man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but Dale overhears the real killers at the town fair. In order to give the boy a chance to prove his innocence, Pat helps spring him from jail.The Set Up: Eccentric ""Ole Granny"" has been making a living as a trapper on her mountain property. When she refuses to sell her land to a crooked tycoon, he tries to take it from her by having her declared 'crazy.' Roy and Dale help to prove otherwise.The Unwilling Outlaw: Framed for a crime he did not commit, Jed Collins calls upon Roy to help."
5,Wow.,"WOW. Thats the first word that comes to mind when listing to this cd. Wow.. for those of you that dont know the mingus big band plays all of charlie mingus's compositions and such and so forth. This cd is very well done, with especially great tracks being Moanin' (a classic) and and Goodbye Porkpie Hat, i reccomed this album for anyone who enjoys big band, and jazz. High reccomemended."
3,Better stick to the original Mingus recordings,"This album is OK, mostly because the tunes are excellent. However, its clearly missing something without Charles Mingus. Mingus was a great bandleader, and a very demanding one at that. On this album it sounds like the performers are having a good time performing, but they don't reach the standards that Charles Mingus would have set had he been leading the band..."
4,"No frills, effectively replaces the original.",Bought this to replace the washer control knob that broke after years of faithful use. It isn't as nice as the original but looks the same from a distance and works just as well. Not bad for the price.
4,Great assesment of the issues,"I picked this book up because I was interested in learning something about globalization. I'm tired of hearing the same arguments from anti-globalization fanatics, and Legrain's commentary on the issue is crystal clear.He often begins each chapter with a blurb from a prominent globalization opponent, such as Naomi Klein, and then goes on to refute it. Legrain makes his case crystal clear and uses plenty of solid evidence to back up what he says. Although he does not think globalization is the best thing to happen to humanity, he does believe it benefits us more than we think.This book is written from a European perspective, so there is a lot of attention given to preserving the ""welfare state"" for the needy. If you can get past that, you'll love the book."
1,Absolute disgrace,"JFK was no doubt one of the greatest orators of the 20th century. At a minimum, his words inspired a vision and left an impression that audiences wouldn't soon forget and that's why I'm thoroughly dissapointed with this compilation of speeches. Not only are there notable omissions such as his American University address, but the current selections used are too short and hardly worthwhile watching in 3 minute segments. The tape itself is not very long and certainly if the producers were willing, some of these speeches could've been lengthened or shown in their entirety, as well as others incorporated. Instead what we have here is a bunch of useless footage that unless the watcher understands the major events of JFK's presidency or the man in particular, you're left scratching your head and wondering what motivated the speech or shaped the man's views in that regard. I think a narration on the side would've helped here. Not worth the money."
4,"Good content, but not so good production","The other reviewers were correct in their comments about the quality of the production of this tape. Editing is sometimes choppy and some of the video quality is poor.However, forget what I just said and buy this tape anyhow. Any chance to watch and listen to this great and inspiring American is a blessing. To those born after JFK, you definately need to listen to John Kennedy.John F. Kennedy's messages of courage, challenge, and sacrifice for the common good are as relevant today as they were forty years ago. If more people listened to these inspiring messages and heeded JFK's words, our country would not be in the sorry state it is in today. This is particularly true when you look at the self-serving state of our current national and business leaders.Listen to JFK, and learn about a time when the leadership of America believed in something beyond making money at the expense of everyone else."
3,Not really a good book for total beginners,"This book is better suited to review or conversational practice. The lessons don't include any grammatical explanations. You're pretty much left to figure it out for yourself using the minimal footnotes, and comparing the words with the inflexion charts in the reference grammar in the back. I used this book in my first (unsuccessful) attempt to learn Modern Greek."
2,Conversational Modern Greek in 20 Lessons,"The book is of some help, like any other language book where the author tries to imitate the sound of the language. The back page of the book advertises a ""Free CD or Cassette in Greek to the buyer of this language book"".A CD accompanying a language course is very useful as you can imitate the speakers pronunciation, which is difficult doing it by reading a close resemblance from a book.When you receive the book you will realise that this offer is only for US and Canada bringing a flimsy excuse in small print ""due to foreign customs regulations""I wrote to the publishers explaining that in my country there are no customs restrictions of educational material and if they could send me my a free CD.Todate the publisher did not have the decency to reply to my request."
5,Another great giant microbes product,"Giant microbes are a hit in our scientific house. This one is just a bit less similar to the actual microbe (not as long and thin, more fat and snake-like) than some others, but has the added bonus of being able to be worn as a bracelet in addition to being a soft and cuddly companion. This is also a sturdy product (but I wouldn't recommend twisting too hard out of shape). Information tag, as with all of the giant microbe products, is very child engaging and informative."
3,need a way to make it tighter,I like this visor but it slips down on my forehead; my head is not too small and not too big but this visor needs to be tighter.
2,Smaller than it looks,"Great fit, but much smaller brim size than it looks. It doesn't slip off or give me a headache, but I'm trying to find a much bigger brim size."
2,poor audio on discs 3 & 4. Beware!,"The DORIAN GRAY and TURN OF THE SCREW discs presented me with the same audio problem described by other reviewers: the actors sound like thier mouths are full of cotton. I played the discs on several different DVD players with the following results: no audio problem on Sony players, inaudible dialogue on Panasonic players. (JEKYLL/HYDE and DRACULA discs played perfectly on ALL players.) Conclusion: DORIAN GRAY and TURN OF THE SCREW discs contain defect making the audio incompatible with some players. MPI continues to ignore the problem."
2,Defective Set???,Wow I love Dan Curtis and his stuff but Disc #4 Taming of the Shrew is Audio Defective! The menu and Bonus Clip interviews have sound but the actual Movie sound is almost completely muffled and inaudible! I called 'Julie' at MPI and she said it was the first she'd heard of it. I wonder if just mine was defective or a glitch in their pressings. I'd like some more feed backs on this set to see if others have this same problem. Rinky Dink Quality is why I'm giving this set a low mark.
2,no fruit,WE have had this tree over 3 years it has not matured or produced any fruit. It is still alive that is it.
4,using it for a research project,This book was very easy to understand and Pellegrini would put things in terms that anyone can understand. At the end of every he spends a section going into greater detail about each experiment he conducted. These sections are usually more technically than the rest of the book. Helpful grapph's and pictures too. A bit repetitive though.
3,"pretty music, but not all CHRISTMAS music!","This is a nice collection of pretty pieces ... but at least four of the selections are either FUNERAL music or have NOTHING to do with the holidays!!Tracks 3 and 12 are from REQUIEM masses; track 14 is the famous dirge-like ""Adagio for Strings"" by Barber that became the theme-music to the movie ""Platoon"", and track 10 is an avant-garde piano-piece by Erik Satie that has no use in a Christmas program --"
3,"Long on hikes, short on geology","I delighted in using Ellen Bishop's Hiking Oregon's Geology and Scott Babcock and Robert J. Carson's Hiking Washington's Geology. I expected this book to provide similar detailed geological descriptions along the hikes. No such luck! This book takes you to the great geological examples but falls short on geological explanations. There are nice references to the history of settlement and early mining, however."
3,Good for what it is,"I too thought that this book was going to have contemporary plans instead of reprints of 1930's houses. Despite my initial disappointment I can say that the book remains useful as a sourcebook of nice exterior and interior details of three different South West styles. For a person actually intersted in building a real adobe out of abobe there is also some useful information. However, if you are looking for a book of frame houses, stucco-clad and three-car-garaged, then this is probably not the book for you."
2,"Caution, no CD+G","I was anxious to get this CD and received it quickly. However, I was disappointed to find out that this CD does not offer graphics. At least, graphics to not seem to work with my CD+G Karaoke machine - though I've not had a problem with others."
5,The Best Sherlock Holmes Adaptations,"Jeremy Brett is a brilliant Sherlock Holmes, perfectly fitting my mental image in both appearance and character. These adaptations are nearly flawless and faithful to the original text. When I was young, I watched this series, delighting in Holmes's dry wit and keen intellect. A must see for any Sherlock Holmes fan."
2,hmmm,"The shows were wonderful. Good suspense and I love Jeremy Brett--the best Sherlock out there. But in 'The Final Problem' they had a nude ""art"" scene with a woman. Come on, this is just not right, why would they ruin the movie with that?!If they would have left out the ""art"" they movie would be a 5 star, and it would have been just fine."
5,Be good to your ears...,"This was one of my earliest forays into the acid jazz world, and one of my best purchases. Each track may contain elements of the previous cut, but that's like saying there was a pretty girl in just about every bar you hopped last night---where's the negative in that?! I've bought this cd twice as gifts to people I thought would appreciate it and they loved it---hands down. Now, experience the experience for yourself."
2,"Strong vocals, but tired music","The singing on this album is pretty strong, brought ot you by two ladies with more soul in their pinky fingers than the average techno diva, but they don't get matched with the most moving beats. The grooves on this record are all about 1-2 steps away from being songs you can actually hang out with after a couple of listens, but at this stage just sound like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air breaks (click and sample and see), and over and over again at that. You might not be thrown totally off if you just want something to play as background sound, but with the singing upfront (and the lyrics not being very...fresh, let's say) you'll constantly be made aware of the tracks, and conversely the derivative, so-so quality of the CD."
2,Competent but lacks punch,"Everdell does a competent job of arranging what is essentially a series of essays on a variety of Modernist thinkers. Unfortunately, I believe his book is too specific for the general reader and does too little with covered ground to interest the scholar. By focusing on the person rather than the subject, the book fails to say much when taken as a whole. Everdell gets bogged in the minutia of each thinkers' work without really exploring the connections between them and this prevents him from breaking new ground on the broader historical understanding of Modernism. In the end, a lamentable flaw but not a fatal one and for the reader somewhere between generalist and scholar, this book should offer something of interest."
3,"Too many anecdotes, not enough insight",This book prefers telling all the anecdotes to the telling anecdote. More space explicating important ideas and much less to painting a broad canvas that gets in as many names as possible would have been helpful.
5,Orbitronik,"Orbitronik is Brian Ladd and Scott Gibbons. These two guys started Orbitronik over the phone, to this day they have not met in person, the cd is comprised of sounds distortions making them sound space age. 14 songs of pure electronic music, in fact this cd took 20 years to make. most of the sounds here were recorded years earlier by Brian and saved. Brian then sent them to Scott who mixed them and ended up with this excellent disc."
5,Buy the paperback version!,"Save yourself the money and buy this book in paperback. This excellent series is well-known, so I needn't mention that they did a great job on Burns."
5,Klondikes Chipped Ham & Skyscraper Cones,I you like history of Pittsburgh you will enjoy this book. Isaly's was a big part of it. Lived on Fifth Ave. & Craft and use to walk to what we called Big Isaly's what a treat ist was and so is this book. Well done!
3,"It is a good, but sad story.","The story of Isaly's is good, and, since I grew up in Youngstown, I was interested, but it is a say story"
2,Not like the picture,"I was looking for green drapes I could use for a dining room or bedroom, and thought these would work (they look really nice in the only picture available). When I got them in the mail today, I quickly noticed that they were very shiny, had holes in them like a jersey (I didn't know what ""jersey"" meant in the title), and they just weren't the color I was looking for (although, it was hard to tell, because the color shifts from yellow-green to slightly bluish green in the light, because of the shine).If you're looking for something that reminds you of sports (and you don't mind them being see-through), then it's probably a good deal, but if you're looking for something normal, don't buy these. You'd do better buying some fabric and making your own."
3,Not a fit for some applications,"Buyer Beware! This kit does not contain the correct upper radiator isolator mounts for a 1987 GMC V1500 4WD. This ""square"" body style was around for years, there may be a lot of GM pickups that the kit does not correctly cover. Prothane"
4,Good Read,Romance writer Lacey Avery is in a car accident and is rescued by Damien Christoval a fire captain. Lacey looks alot like Damien's dead wife and Lacey is unable to have children - the two issues that must be overcome by Lacey & Damien. I did find the love scenes rather tame and Damien's insensitive treatment of Lacey while he was in the hospital were both negatives for me. Overall it was a good read.
2,It didn't hold my interest,I really wanted to like this book and the story started off okay but mid way through I started to get bored. Lacey and Damien's romance didn't sizzle and I don't mean just the sex scenes. They had a dull relationship and I think the author tried too hard to make their connection believible. The pace of the book was so slow. Damiens famliy members were annoying and way too needy. All of them from his parents to his siblings needed to give the man a chance to live his own life. They always needed him for everything. I understand this showed what a great guy he was but enough already. Lacey was boring and frankly I just didn't like her. Towards the end of the book Damien said and did some really cruel things to Lacey and yeah yeah we know why he did them but does that really make it okay? And the way she so easily took him back after her hurt and humiliated was really annoying.
4,Beatle-Mania Explored!,"Before They Were Beatles: The Early Years: 1956-1960 by Alan Porter is an amazing chronological exploration of the way the ""Fab Four"" formed. Porter's extensive love and dedication to conveying the lives of the Beatles before they were, in fact, Beatles is enthralling and fascinating. England native, Porter, instantly draws his readers into the history, geography, and background of Paul, John, Ringo, and George in a way that is unobtrusive yet engaging. Each year has been extensively researched and documents they unique way the boys came together to form the world-wide phenomenon they became. Porter is thoughtful, thorough, and thrilling in his expose of the lives of the rising stars. It is a book that appeals to many and would be a much welcomed additioned to any library."
3,Interesting stuff - but badly proofed!,"If you are a diehard Beatles fan, then this book is a good buy. There were some nice little nuggets of info in there that I hadn't heard before. There's more info on John than on the others, so John fans will be particularly happy.However - was this book ever proof read? The number of typos, misspellings and grammatical errors is appalling! A few examples: Rev Pyrce-Jones (of Woolton Church), should be 'Pryce'; ""...becoming a nescient rock group"" should be ""nascent""; Groverner Ballroom in Wallasey is actually 'Grosvenor'."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"The sound/video was not good for a how to DVD. Also, it didn't give any explanations on what and why they were doing. It was basically just cut this wire, buy the same type of product and replace the same wire where the old one was. (no kidding? I could have figured that out without the video) This is okay for someone with no electrical experience who wants to understand a basic idea of electrical devices."
5,Awesome,I purchased this for my mom and she loves it! It came faster than I expected and I didn't have to leave the house to go find it in a store.
5,Oh My God! Who Wrote That Review!??!! Great BookThough,"This book is a horror readers treat!, I loved everything about this novel. I enjoy anything written by Gary Brandner, he has a simple cinematic style of writing, mentally it's like watching your own personal horror film. Who wrote the review below me?, Oh!...My!...God!...can anyone say school...or english class?!...YUK! Synopsis; Joana was one of the dead, But she was brought back to life!. That's when people began trying to kill her...nice people...the last people in the world anyone would suspect of being capable of murder...people who were already dead..."
4,Could be printed on both side like the originals,"Received in a timely fashion. Quality was very good, but the only improvement that could be made is to have them printed on both sides like the original Kismet sheets were."
4,"Jack as Jec ""Doctor Jeckyll and Mr Hyde""",This is a fast moving version of the Stevenson story that benifits from strong casting. Palance is an athletic and very menacing Hyde. The atmosphere of foggy London of the 1880's is captured quite nicely. All in all alot of fun to watch!
4,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde DVD Review,"A well-made, well-written, and well-acted film, even though the quality of the picture is slightly below average. It would be nice to see this film with a high-quality film-to-disk transfer. The aspect ratio is 4:3."
2,not good at all sorry,"This movie is terrible. The coloring is dull, the acting is poor & the make up is so fake looking. Jack Palance was 83 when he made this movie & it shows. I only bought the movie because I like Jack Palance but it was a waste of money. I could not even get through it. I'm sorry that I do not agree with the rest of the reviews. It doesn't look like a normal movie. It is all pale & looks like a play."
4,In depth reading,"Excellent resource material. only wish it was formatted for easier reading/ pictures/ diagrams.Sometimes one doesn't have the time in outdoor situations to read the book: Just need the meat and potaoes of the information to get through the situation.BUT, excellent source of knowledge."
5,awesome book,"To those who are interested in building shelters or various designs of shelters this is an invaluable addition to your resources. This book should be mandatory reading to all; both, children and adults."
3,book great but was bent on arrival,this was an interesting and has many different types of shelters. It has good pictures and info on how to collect and build a shelter. The problem i have is that when it was shipped the book was bent in shipping creasing about half the book. It is a book that i think i will enjoy because my son is going into boyscouts
3,Average,"I wish the author would have spent more time and detail, pics included, with the simpler shelters. I'm never going to build one of those extravagant shelters. A few of those require an architect and professional builder. Unrealistic IMO."
1,DON'T FORGET THE USS LIBERTY,"The USS Liberty incident was an attack on a United States Navy technical research ship, USS Liberty, by Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft and Israeli Navy motor torpedo boats, on June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War.[3] The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members (naval officers, seamen, two Marines, and one civilian), wounded 171 crew members, and severely damaged the ship.[4] At the time, the ship was in international waters north of the Sinai Peninsula, about 25.5 nmi (29.3 mi; 47.2 km) northwest from the Egyptian city of Arish."
3,The gibberish virus,"I really enjoyed this episode and felt that it was a good outing for season one of DS9. In fact, the reason why I give this episode only 3 stars is because there are so many truly outstanding episodes later in the series that I have to compare it to!In this episode, a virus that causes everyone to start speaking in gibberish slowly overtakes the station and the crew must figure out the antidote before people start dying. Ultimately, almost everyone but Odo and Quark succumbs to the illness...but not before Kira saves the day!The ensemble cast feel of DS9 is at it's best in this episode, because all the main characters get a good part in the action. Exemplary performances by Alexander Siddig and Nana Visitor make this one a little-known gem."
1,Sacral Nerve-Root Cysts: Another cause of the sciatic or cada equina syndrome,"This is simply a POOR copy of another copy of the book in a plastic notebook binding. It has personal handwritten notations throughout. Although the seller's listing says ""Unknown Binding""....it is clearly misrepresented! It is SAD that someone would sell this on Amazon for such a healthly price, at the expense of someone else. I have this disease, and cannot even read most of the information because of it's poor quality. I have contacted the seller and indicated that I am returning the item, asked for a refund. I am totally disappointed."
5,A wonderful book.,"Great photographic reproductions of wonderful old photos of Philadelphia. This book is a treasure to those interested in architecture, photography and/ or Philadelphia. Highly recommended."
1,A very poor value,"The CD ""reveals"" some tricks that have been explained before. A very poor value.The CD ""reveals"" some tricks that have been explained before. A very poor value."
4,Nice Surprise,"This composer is new to me and this recording is quality from the first piece,but my favorite is the Symphony. Just wait until you hear the piano movement in this beautiful and lively symphony. I can't even play a toy piano."
3,great singer; bland music,"Jeannie Bryson is potentially a major singer. Her first Concord albums were a delight. She has a warm, easy singing style and shows some concern about choice of songs. But the musicians and esp. the arrangements on this record are non-descript, indifferent, slick MOR jazz. I don't know what pressure record companies put on singers to melt in with the background these days. Perhaps the record is just the way Ms Bryson wants it. But like other gifted singers in the past, Carmen Lundy comes to mind, if this record is the future, then Ms Bryson is in danger of forfeiting hers.She needs to surround herself with creative musicians and arrangements who can match her talent."
2,A Mixed Bag,"Purchasing one of the ""Extended Versions"" discs is always a bit of an adventure, as one never knows what to expect. Some are quite good, while others are simply dreadful. This is a rather interesting mixture of live tracks from different eras. For example, there are tracks from ""Johnny Winter And...Live"" and ""Johnny Winter Captured Live"", which were recorded with different lineups a few years apart. This one, then, is something of a musical collage. It's not bad, but not great, either. For serious Johnny Winter fans, most (if not all) these tracks are already in their collections; however, for the new fan, it presents a fairly decent sampler of Johnny's live work."
5,Outstanding Service,The Townhouse arrived before the delivery date provided. It is well worth every penny paid for it. I am very pleased with the product and the great service!
2,"Perfume, Smerfume","I'm not much of a perfume wearer, but I got this for a present and I try to spray some on when I remember it's on the dresser. It smells really nice - light and floral, but it doesn't seem to last very long. After an hour or two, it has usually faded away."
1,Paperback is not the same as hardcover,"Hello, If you are looking for a paperback version for the hardcover book with the same name, this is not it. Actually the ISBN Number belongs only to the Study Guide to that book. I got it shipped and I am really upset about that."
1,Hell Indeed,"This story no doubt deserves to be told - but by an author who can actually write. Pre-teens might like it, I could not get past one chapter. Money wasted, if I'd wanted Nancy Drew I would have bought it. So disappointing!!"
2,disappointed!!,"I thought I did my homework before getting this toy. Every review I read on Imaginext toys was that they were great, durable toys. This one is anything but. It is way too difficult for my 5 year old to put together by himself (I can barely do it in 15 minutes, studying the instructions step by painful step!) I threw the box assuming it would be like all the other toys everyone raved about, otherwise this would definitely be going back to the store!"
3,label pieces,putting together this toy was very difficult...the directions were not clear...actually there were no words to help put the fort together....it would have helped if the pieces were labeled or numbered or something...I find this situation with all the Imaginext products..
1,So disapointed,My son received this as a gift and it took 2 adults and glue to put it together! Totally defeats the purpose of having this toy. We found it would not stay together without the glue. The lightest touch would cause the entire thing to collapse. If he hadn't seen the toy out of the box we would have thrown it out or returned it. With all of the initial positive reviews I seriously wonder if there has been a recent redesign from the initial product. Quality of this product is terrible.
1,Flimsy Garbage!!!!,Don't listen to people who gave this good reviews! This is the worst toy I've ever experienced. It looks gorgeous on the box but believe me it's only for display. One touch and the entire thing crumbles EVERY time! It's horrible. You'll find better quality toys at the dollar store. What a disappointment! I won't be purchasing any imaginext toys again. Ever.
1,Confusing waste of time...better off with Legos!,I am not a fan of the imaginext line...It's just too much confusion even with the instructions. Legos makes much more sense to me.
2,disaster,"We were initially very excited about this toy; however, the castle collapses very very easily! It took FOREVER to put together (my husband did it) just to have it fall apart. My child never plays with it anymore. It is too much trouble putting it together & having it stay together. I was thinking of throwing it in the trash but I keep thinking about how much we paid for it - plus the accessories! It is a lot of fun while it is together. It just gets frustrating having to worry about it. I guess it would be a good idea to glue it. I may try that."
1,Fisher Price Disappoints!,"As a stay at home mom of three boys, I spend considerable money on keeping my children entertained. I know a good bit about toys and this one makes me want to spit nails. Save your money for something else. I am incessantly putting it together (and yes, I am doing it properly). It just always (not exaggerating) falls apart. It is the biggest pain. As far as I know, my sons play hard but not harder than other boys. I never write opinions, chat online or whatever but I hate this toy so much that I had to let prospective buyers know. I noticed this toy at a friend's house and when I said we have the toy as well, she immediately replied that hers constantly comes apart. Go figure!! Much to my kids' dismay, I super glued the toy where it could only be configured in one design (it can be 3 different ways)and even then it ultimately came apart. When put together, they love it. Fisher Price please revamp!!!"
2,Hard to put and stay together,"I will not buy any more Imaginex toys. We bought this for Christmas for our 5 year old son last year. He plays constantly with lego's and knex. He cannot put this thing together and keep it together long enough to play with it. Even when we put it together for him, it is very flimsy. The connections are not stong enough to withstand normal playing. It is alway falling apart. Very frustrating for him. I was very disappointed. Too pricy for the quality of toy."
1,This toy stinks. Don't waste your money.,"We bought this set for our son's birthday. We ended up returning it to Amazon. It was terrible. Every time our son touched it, it fell apart. In the first day, the dragon broke twice. The gate on the jail also would not stay on. Our son ended up in tears. We are big fans of Fisher Price but NOT Imaginext."
1,way too tough to put together,"I assembled a smaller piece of the collection in this series without too much difficulty, but this larger fortress is impossible. The problem comes in putting long assembled sections on top of other sections. I'm sticking with legos from now on!"
1,"Looks cool, but too much work to keep together!","Our kids have gotten two Imaginext sets as gifts, the construction one and the castle one. They are so hard to set up and keep together. Everytime the kids want to play with it, it takes forever to figure out how they go together. When I finally get them together, I have to fix it every 5 minutes. The toys do not stay together! I admit, they look so cool on the box, But way too much work. I even called the company to tell them the problems I was having, the guy was not suprised. He said they get that complaint alot!"
5,Great watch!,This is a beautiful watch! I really like the Swiss movement and the screw-down stem features. I own several Invicta watches and have alway been very impressed with the quality and the attention to detail in these timepieces.
5,This is a Fine watch,"Great deal at the time. shipped fast and without a glitchIts lighter than the near Rolex model which is great for me, and still seams like it, all my colleges thought it was a Rolex from a distance.Nice golden color.Still working after 3 years"
3,All the Trendy Horses,"Part of the fun of reading postmodern criticism is its outlandishness,its attacks on conventional modern modes of thought. Best and Kellner, well-versed in the theories of Derrida, Lacan, Baudrillard, Bordieu and the other wild beasts of France and their worldwide acolytes, manage to take much of the fun right out them. In a style that is pendantic, dull, but full of insight, they trace the interpenetration of the modern with the postmodern and talk reasonably about the irreasonable. Good content, bad style."
2,Phenomenon / Coldplay DVD,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a huge coldplay fan, watched it with him, and was extremely disappointed that I can't return it. This is not a concert DVD. It is a ""review."" There are several featured songs on the DVD, but not one of them is played in its entirety without being interrupted by a ""commentator."" The ""reviews"" are well done, but in hindsight, I should have rented this before buying it."
5,Back to form,"Volume 1 in this series remains one of my favorite albums (and my first review on Amazon back in 1998!). Volume 2 was nice but didn't stand the test of time for me. Volume three has been in my car for years, and I still play and enjoy it. Again, a couple tracks I always skip, but remarkable songs like ""Music in my Room"" keep me coming back again and again..."
4,cute ornament,"this is a really cute product...from the picture it kind of looks like it would be hand painted wood or glass but it's actually plastic; with that said, even in person it looks like it's hand painted glass until you actually pick it up. it's a very nice ornament, i bought it for my boyfriend as part of his christmas present and he loved it."
1,Satan Met Some Crappy Writing.,"Not enough Bette Davis, far too much Warren William, and who had the really bad idea to make this into a comedy? Warren William is not a funny man, the writing is awful and costumes are terrible. Dismal."
4,Maybe 3.5 Stars,"While the overall book was enjoyable enough, there are a few problems that really left me disappointed with it. I loved the way I. Christie incooperated a very tasteful and sexual plot into an interesting mystery plot. My main problem was with the way that sexual plot was pretty much abandoned at the end of the book. Furthermore, the mystery plot, while wrapped up seems to have been wrapped up a little too vaguely for me. Initially I had no problem with this, thinking that the details would come forth while she wrapped up the whole sexual plot that was a major part of the book, but she didn't. If you can get this book for less than the 20 dollar price tag, I would say it's worth reading. Otherwise, buy a couple of other good lesbian books for the same price."
5,This study has it all.,"For the woman who is desires a more in-depth study in the Word of God (specifically the book of Judges), but with practical/devotional applications--look no further! In a book of the Bible where failure to do the right thing is commonplace, Sandra's insightful commentary challenges the reader's own personal relationship with God. The book is perfect for small a group of women who want to start a Bible study, a Sunday School class, or just for the individual wanting to gain a further understanding into Judges. You will be blessed."
5,The Old Testament Made Relevant for Today,"Wanted: Extraordinary Bible studies for ordinary people, scholarly explanations-but in plain English, history to bring context to biblical stories.Found: Sandra Glahn's remarkable Coffee Cup Series! Glahn sets solid theological content into a conversational style for any reader to enjoy. Prepare yourself to be delighted yet challenged as you imbibe the truths of the scriptures addressed in this series."
2,Could Be More In-Depth,"Our Bible study group purchased this guide and used it successfully to study Judges. However, I later came across Gary Inrig's book ""Hearts of Iron Feet of Clay"" which substantially increased my understanding of Judges. It is not a study guide, per se, but would be a great resource to be used by the leader in conjunction with Glahn's book."
4,"Overall a great, useful resource","Great book, nicely detailed. One minor complaint: perhaps I don't understand the way these things are supposed to be laid out, but sometimes the names of the guitar chords given reflect the key change brought about by the placement of the capo on the neck, and sometimes they don't. Also, the fingerings for the chords are given sometimes, but not always. This isn't a real problem as the tabs are very good. But lest this review sounds too negative, let me stress that that the book is really a great collection of sheet music for some fantastic and difficult (at least for me!) songs.Oh yeah, one other little thing (not related to the sheet music): the book description describes ""Martin Barre's ground-breaking acoustic work"" and as I understand it from the albums themselves, it's Ian Anderson playing acoustic guitar."
1,"Horrible junk - from 2 sets, one never worked and the other one broke down within less than 6 months","These (I guess) after market batteries are just plain garbage and an awful waste of resources. Don't buy. I bought two. The first never charged and I returned it for full refund. The second worked for a few weeks but now only charges to ~50% capacity, with further decreasing tendency. And I didn't even use it much. The rubber foot attached to it (to become one of the laptops rubber feet) fell off immediately when I first unpacked it. I am contemplating to dispose of it for fear that one day it might cause damage to the laptop. Awful junk. Should be taken off the market immediately."
3,Still not durable,"Replaces the other battery but also lasts very little, it is worth it if you want to extend your laptops life a little but overall not worth the trouble."
5,the single book that started my interest in the war.........,This book is to be read each time you visit the battle site. There is much honor in the author's efforts.
5,"""Photographic Legacy"" says it all","As they say ""A picture is worth a thousand words."" This book goes even further than that - a photo is just a photo - an ""interpreted"" photo, however, is priceless. There are many books about America's bloodiest day - many are informative, many of those are somewhat dry reading. This book does a real good job of mixing photos with the facts and providing detailed descriptions and interpretation of the events that occured and the people involved on that infamous day. The author has true insight - both into photography and about history."
4,Easy quilts that look difficult,"The quilts in this book are easy to construct, but have the look of more complicated designs, because of the use of color. If you want to learn how to use color value to make secondary patterns, this is a good starting point."
1,kid's book,"old-fashioned story of yesteryear, plot rather fanciful, characters not developed. On the good side, no bad language or sexual content."
5,Gorgeous!,"Haunting. Dreamy. Wild. Beautiful.Just a few words to describe the music on the soundtrack. I loved the movie, but it was the music I loved most about it and was delighted to find the cd. Truly soul-stirring melodies!"
3,glassworks?,Has no-one ever remarked on the similarity between the piano theme of this movie and the piece Opening on Philip Glass' Glassworks? I too love the music on this CD but every time I hear the piano theme I hear the opening of Glassworks.
5,Det er nydelig musikk!!,"I haven`t got the cd, but I am playing :The heart asks pleasure first, on my piano- And I have seen the movie several times. It`s wounderfuel..exelente-.. -a 17girl pianoplayer"
4,Response to Lawrance M. Bernabo's Review,"I must echo all that Dr. Bernabo said in his excellent review, but want to point out one major mistake. He said about the film that ""I have to remind myself that it was not even nominated for an Academy Award"". This is quite untrue; in fact, the film was nominated for EIGHT Oscar's and won THREE. You can check the facts at www.imdb.com, search for The Piano and click the Awards link in the left-hand navigation table."
1,Pretentious noodling from a musical poseur,"If you loved the film (I personally hated it) then you probably loved this pretentious claptrap from Michael Nyman and my comments will anger you. But really, even aside from the absurdly anachronistic relationship of the musical style to the time period depicted in the film, this music has little to recommend it. New-agey fluff, harmonically and melodically pointless, this quasi-improvisatory doodling conjures up images of Keith Jarrett ( no offense to that great keyboard master) recovering from a frontal lobotomy. The chord progressions don't make sense and the ""melodies"" wander aimlessly and end arbitrarily. If you just like the sound of a piano but don't care what actual notes are played, you might be able to stand this.Otherwise, give it a wide berth.Not recommended, even to my enemies."
5,Can I give 6 stars just this once???,"I've been listening to this one for 3 years. Not tired of it in the least. The music just takes you away into another world, especially track #6, The Promise. After a hard day at work, with the kids, whatever, just keep playing The Promise over and over and over. Track #2, Big My Secret, is perfect for a private romantic interlude. Even if you haven't seen the movie, Get This CD."
5,"Beautiful, haunting music","I absolutely love this CD. The movie was one of my favorites during college, and the music takes me back to that time. It is relatively easy to listen to, although it is a bit somber."
5,Must have this vinegar on hand!,"Gave this as gifts with orange infused olive oil and organic orange jam along with this recipe. A really big hit!Citrus Vinaigrette2 Tablespoons Blood Orange Vinegar (Cuisine Perel)2 Tablespoons Orange jam (Seville Orange Organic Fruit Spread)1/3 Cup Orange infused olive oil (Winterhill Olive Oil)Combine vinegar and jam in a small bowl or blender. Add oil in a thin stream, blending well."
2,Too fake and super sped up,"I like old school kung fu like: 7 Grand Masters,36 Chambers,Sleeping Fist, but this is too fake and super sped up. If you like Jet Li it may be for you. It was just too crazy for me. I turned it off after about ten min. Trying to sell it"
1,"Oh, God No!",I put the video in for two minutes and they already got bare breasts plastered all over the screen! It's a shame you can't find good clean family entertainment these days.
5,Eyesinweasel isn't bad...GBV tracks!,"It's cool to have an Eyesinweasel live albumn with Tobin playing GbV tunes, solo favorites, and Eyesinweasel tracks. Almost all of the tracks standout, there are a few tracks that are totally unfamilar though. It's just a great effort to have especially for Tobin fans, I personally think Tobin rules. Mincer Ray! All Used Up! You can't beat 'em. Quality tracks."
5,Wish I Had This Years Ago!,"I like this pump so much that I recommended it to my next door neighbor, and even wrote down the link to the site. Compared to my old, smaller pump that pumped water off my pool cover at a trickle, this pump does the job like a high-pressured faucet."
3,Pool Cover Pump,The delivery time was super excellent and the pump itself far outweighed my expectations for the price. I saved at least $100 than if I had bought from our local pool dealer even including postage - plus it has a lot more power! I'm very pleased!
5,Gets the job done quickly,Not much to say about this - it does what it is supposed to do. Pumps quickly and quietly. I have no problems with its size or operation.
5,Grammy Worth Material,"After watching the fantastic movie I had to have to soundtrack. And rightfully so, this album is simply fantastic. Willy Wonka's Theme is catchy and will get in your head and stay there for many days, forever if you buy this album. Which you should, possibly the best soundtrack for a movie this year. Tracks one through seven are must hear masterpieces. Get it!"
5,Wonderful in Every Way,"This soundtrack, and movie for that matter, has quickly jumped to one of my all time favorite soundtracks (and films!!). The best way to explain this soundtrack is delightfully creepy, amazing, and slightly original. (I say this because, yes, I agree it reminds me of all of Danny Elfman's other work, but it is great nonetheless!) I could listen to this CD 24/7 and still enjoy it just as much as the first time. This is a must have for any Elfman fan or any music fan for that matter. Truly amazing. QUICK! BUY IT NOW BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY GRAVE MISTAKES!"
5,WOW,I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter after she saw the movie. She absolutely loves it and sings the songs all the time. What a great gift.
2,stick with Edward Scissorhands,"I am a huge fan of Danny Elfman's work. I own many of his compositions, but I find Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be a fetid conglomeration of many of his past scores. I would recommend instead Edward Scissorhands (in my opinion, his best so far). I would also recommend Instinct, Big Fish and his Batman scores (as well as his Spiderman scores, though I did not like all the cues on the cds, but most of them). In terms of songs rather than orchestral compositions, I found the songs in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory horribly grating, but I appreciated that Mr. Elman incorporated Roald Dahl's original verses. I would recommend instead the wonderful songs (and score) of The Nightmare Before Christmas."
2,The difference between the real thing and the imitation,"Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here."
2,It must be a joke!,I can't understand all these 5 stars reviews. The original soundtrack of the 1971 movie is far superior to this one.
4,Elfman's most brilliant and most...entertaining...,"When I heard Danny Elfman was going to do Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', I said,'No duh.' and 'it's not going to be that great.' But, I love it! It is most brilliant!His Oompa-Loompa songs are so fun and inventive! His score for the film is also quite amazing. He gave a magical feel to it yet he kept it weirded out with odd percussion and vocals.A great CD for Elfman fans. It's worth the money."
5,Danny Elfman is Back!!!!,"This is a great movie CD. The opening song is one that will stay on your mind long after you are finished listening to it.The songs about the other children are very different in type. They range from a 70's style to a rock to classic Oingo Boingo. Danny Elfman really shows his style with this album. You can just imagian ""Dead Man's Party"" when you listen to this album and some of the songs. It made me want to listen to some old Oingo Boingo.If you ever like Danny Elfman music, this is a great CD to buy. I highly recommend it for all."
5,Sweets For The Sweet,"As always, Danny Elfman delivers for his long time associate Tim Burton in Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. Elfman made a fantastic score for the film that pulls you right in from the opening sequence. Anyone who knows the work of Danny Elfman knows how he likes to blend light sounds with dark sounds, creating a twisted, terrific tune for every film he's been involved with. This time around, his music matches up with the movie perfectly seeing as Burton's rendition of the Wonka tale is both magical and maniacal. The Oompa Loompa songs are hilarious and will definately have you dancing a jig(or just rolling on the ground laughing).If you love Danny Elfman's music or if you simply love great music scores, this is for you!!"
3,Sweet ear candy.,"My 5 year old daughter loves this movie and loves singing the songs to herself, so this cd was a no-brain purchase. The disc smartly begins with the Oompa-Loompa anthems to the ""bad kids"" which is basically what I bought it for. The rest is soundtrack music which is also fun to listen to (in parts, like the Wonkatania ride, which is lively and recognizable to kids who've seen the film.) Worthwhile purchase. Listen to it with your kids."
5,The Best CD in the World!!,"Like the film, this CD is simply the greatest - EVER!! The Oompa Loompas are great, and Danny Elfman has succeded in creating a friendly, but slightly creepy version of Roald Dahls verses from the book. Favourite track - #06 - Main Titles, one of those tunes you can listen to over and over again!! A++++"
1,"Very Little Java for $20, A Lot of Pedantry, A Few Combinators",Buy another book if you want to learn Java or design patterns
3,Interesting Approach To Pattern Learning,Good book. Very interesting style that I like. The question and answer format (if you don't cheat by just looking at the answers) is very good for helping you to learn the material. The concepts in this book can be applied to a number of problems and helped me to clarify the patterns covered by the book.
3,Interesting book,"An interesting book - but the programmed learning approach can be a bit trying at times. This is definitely not a reference book! But a good *workbook* to learn object oriented concepts and introduce you to design-patterns in Java. I personally prefer the writing styles and approach of Gilbert and McCarty on the same topic (as in their ""Object Oriented Design in Java""), but I still found it useful to read about this stuff from Friedman and Felleisen's peculiar perspective."
4,"Probably not what you want, just what you need.","Decades ago, a predecessor of this book introduced me to Lisp. At first, thecutsey Q&A; style put me off, but that book, ""The Little Lisper"", succeeded verywell in its goal of creating a Lisp-speaking recursive mindset for me. Likewisethis book creates a Java-speaking, object-oriented mindset. However, not the mindsetyou may think you want when you start reading. This book is a true sequel to ""TheLittle Lisper"" and not an out-of-the-box Java patterns book. My first reactionwas ""this is really neat but not necessarily too useful"". Wrong. It wasn't longbefore I was designing an open source Java package that stacks Swing objects ina way strongly reminiscent of the stacked pizza toppings in this book. Whoknows? You, too, may end up stacking boxes rather than thinking within them."
4,Socratic approach to OOP and design patterns,"Caveat: I have taken several classes from Dr. Felleisen and enjoy his pedagogical approach.The book follows the philosophical Q&A format popularized by Socrates such that the reader is visually presented with questions on the left-hand side of the page and answers on the right-hand size of the page. One is expected and encouraged to actively participate in the book's pseudo-dialogue.While some experienced programmers and novices who are pressed for time in their work and studies may decry the lack of a ""straightforward"" presentation: that is precisely what this book intends to avoid. A desire to improve & expand one's thinking processes in the context of programming are all that is required for enjoying and benefiting from this book.Excellent for undergrad OO programming classes."
4,Perfect for a Lazy Day,"Michael Webster has a type of musical genius that I believe is underestimated. His music has a sense of greatness and rebellion all rolled into one. It's the perfect music for a lazy day where you can go out to the park with you head phones, watch the clouds and listen. His voice is very mellow, and has a boy-next-door texture that's hard to ignore, but easy to love. I've had this cd for well over two years now, and still listen to it at least once a week. Nothing has lasted longer in my cd case except the Grateful Dead."
4,Hard to win!,"This game is fun but it is very hard to come in first place. I haven't played it very much because it was frustrating. You have to have a lot of patience with it. I wish there were cheat codes! I still would rate this a good game, my son enjoys it."
3,Dream Lover,"For Virginia Henley, these love scenes are a little tame. However, those same scenes may be too descriptive or unconventional for readers who aren't used to her style. I like the way the love story started. I think they both must have fallen in love at first sight. My main wish is that Sean had kidnapped Emerald before her wedding. I know her marriage was an unhappy one that had nothing to do with love, but this book would have been just as good without the adultery aspect. The characters were likeable. Though some very sad events occur, it's a very good book."
5,NOT A BOOK FOR THE WEAK OF HEART,"This was my first Virginia Henley book. The story line was so graphic and shocking at times I realize it was a love it or hate it book. I loved it. Sean goes through some pretty heart stopping experiences that is so well written that it put me in the mind of some movie fick that makes you flinch because of some unexpected sene. The human emotion runs high in this book and I read it in one day.I often read the reviews of books I want to buy and books I already have to gauge if the avg person is thinking what I thought and it helps me to buy the next book based on are we are we thinking alike. This was a perfect example. I realize if you are not up for steamy, grapic, and intense story lines then this author is maybe not for you, but if you like it discriptive and full of human emotion not only is this the story for you but you will probley like most of her books."
2,it's okay,I've read many books but this one was just sad it had potential with the plot but the main characters couldn't keep their hands off each other they din't even to talk much with each other all they did together was... well you get my point. The scenes of passion were also very graphic.
3,A little dark.,"I remember liking Virginia Henley's books, but I don't remember them being so dark. The main character was bent on revenge throughout most of the book and it was a little depressing. I can understand his reasons but it just wasn't fun to watch (read about ) him manipulate a young woman who had nothing to do with his unfortunate circumstances. Thank goodness it was a happy ending, but it wasn't always a fun ride."
5,Hopeless romantic in NH,"I loved this book. I read the second half in one sitting. I could have killed Sean O'Toole myself at one point (I won't ruin it for you, the hero is also quite a villian in this one)! This is my third V. Henley book. For people who say the characters are unrealistic, isn't that the point? If I want to read about ordinary men, I'll pick up Time magazine!"
1,Terrible,"This book was the first I have tried to read by this author. I won't be trying to read another one. It was boring. None of the characters were likable, and if I wanted to read love scenes like the ones in this book, I'd get a copy of Penthouse."
4,Intrigue and passion....,"As many of Virginia Henley's historical romances the setting is vividly described and the unexpected turn of events will compel the reader to turn each page. Emerald, the main character seems like a good friend as we follow her through the story, where she finds true love and then loses sight of it for many years. Henley's storytelling quality at it's finest."
2,the lovely henley should've abandoned this storyline,"Let me make known first: I LOVE VIRGINIA HENLEY. It would do me a great disservice for Ms. Henley to ever stop writing. However, DREAM LOVER greatly paled in comparison to some of her other high caliber writings. It lacked the rampant passion, erotic-enthralling-bordering-on-pornographic sex scenes which may have simply been impeded by the somewhat flat characters. Please, keep in mind that this is all relative because her worst book(gosh, it bites to write that) is another novelists' best. Ms. Henley is the ONLY historical romance novelist."
2,Disappointed,"I'm not a big romance reader, but I've always liked Henley's books. Unfortunately, this was a tremendous let-down. The obstacles to Sean's and Emerald's relationship never seemed very plausible. And Emerald's transformation from free-spirited lass to English rose and back was equally unsatisfying. Everything was just too easy. And Emerald seemed more like an annoying, over-developed child than a rebellious heroine. I'm giving Henley one last shot and after that I'm taking my romance habit elsewhere."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!,"This book really takes your breath away!! The overwhelming emotions this book evokes is incredible!! I was literally sitting in my chair saying "" I can not believe this!"" The horrors that the couple have to go through are sometimes too much to bear, but this keeps the pages turning!"
2,Oh Please!,"This is the third Henley novel I have read, and I have yet to find one in comparison to the first one I read, ""A Year and a Day"". I was disappointed in this book, I found the main character Sean, too unbelievable at times--going around thinking in his head he is the prince of darkness? PLEASE! I felt the sex scenes were borderline porn, and they were written in for the sake of....? Even though I got this secondhand at a bookstore I felt robbed, I will be taking this one back to exchange for a different one, thats for sure. Im almost ready to swear off Virginia Henley, if I can't find one that compares to ""A Year and a Day"" soon."
3,The Supernatural Experience,"I attended the DC Talk concert in Detroit so I was very excited to find the footage in the video from the same concert. That concert was awesome! I have to say that the live video portion wasn't as great as the actual experience. Their voices seemed to overpower the music and not much of the crowd could be heard. In a few of the songs taped the crowd was singing right along, but you wouldn't know it. I think that adds a lot to a live video. The portion of the tape with each individual band member was well done. It was nice to see the boys at home with their families. Overall I really enjoyed the tape (being a big fan) just was a little disappointed with the sound quality of the live performances."
3,Great Video... Must buy for DCTalk fans!,"I loved this video, and most of all the interviews of each of the three members, Toby, Mike and Kevin. It was very insightful and often very funny. To be honest though the mixing of the audio on the concert footage was not very well done. The voices are overpowering and it focused too often on the wrong spots of the stage at the wrong time. On top of this, the concept music videos didn't make much sense. (i.e. My Friend So Long) The Consume Me video was really cool, and creative. Otherwise, I must say that Red Letters was powerful and moved me nearly to tears. You must buy the video for this song alone.If you saw them in concert or not, you must buy this video. Despite the few quirks, I enjoyed it and I'm glad I invested in this archive of a lifetime. Especially at this price, it's worth it!mp3.com/ransom"
5,"The ""Super""natural Experience","As a fan of DC Talk since the days of ""Heavenbound"" I have been to every tour this trio has performed, but was unable to get to the Supernatural tour, and after seeing this video I'm still kicking myself. The video is great, and DC Talk is still as good live as they are on their albums. I also liked the interviews that give us insight of the production and the band's personal life. There are two music videos (Consume Me, My Friend) that are both good. I loved this video, and any true DC Talk fan would too. My only question is, Live from the Freak Show (album) was excellent, will there be a Live from the Supernatural Experience?"
5,"Different Tracks, but great Stuff","If you grew up in the early 60's when this material was originaly recorded, you need to buy this CD. The Astronaut bit alone is worth the price of the CD. My only gripe is that the tracks on the CD are slightly different than what is printed on the Cover. The tracks listed by Amazon on the web site are accurate (15 total), but the CD insert and back cover list 16 cuts. The song ""My Phony Valentine"" seems to be the one missing. What is more strange is that each of the 15 tracks is repeated, so the CD shows as having 30 tracks when you put it in a player. I thought maybe they were different versions, but I cannot tell any difference between tracks 1 and 16, 2 and 17, 3 and 18...They say Laughter is the best medicine, but laughter combined with nostalgia is even better. Take 2 tracks and call me in the morning...."
1,Bait and Switch,"Product was described as Glucosamine Sulfate but was really Glucosamine HCI. If you read the full description you will catch this, but if like me you searched for Glucosamine Sulfate and thought you ordered it - surprise. If you don't believe me - go to: http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Glucosamine-1000-caps/dp/B0014UE8OY/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_2 - if you select the 120 or 240 capsule sizes - the picture shows sulfate - I chose wrong - I chose 180 and got HCI instead. I'm pissed - I had read that sulfate had been tested and shown to be effective and I wanted sulfate."
5,Re-2upply,"We have been taking this for many years and recommend that everyone takes it, This is just another odere to re-supply."
3,hand press pump,The 2 pumps I purchased work well. The paint on the pumps is terrible. All I had to do is rub my hands on the pumps and the paint rubbed off. I removed all of that inferior paint from the 2 pumps that I purchased and repainted them with a good quality enamel paint. All is well now. Too bad they could not have done this before they sold them to me!
3,Have not received it yet,"I really can't rate this hand pump because I have not received it yet. The order page said it was in stock but after the due date passed I sent a question to the seller through Maxhouey (or whatever) and the reply said it stated that it could take up to 6 weeks although I looked at the page again that I saved and I can only see that it states that it is in stock.If it doesn't show up by the 1st of June (6 weeks)then I will really be upset. I will think twice, in the future, about purchasing anything other than DVD's or books from Amazon."
2,An over-rated book and method,"I bought this book based in the many good reviews it has, but frankly now that I have it I found it is greatly over-rated.The first flaw is that is very outdated, first printed in 1952. The dialogues are almost surreal. For example in lesson 5 he introduces as examples of a dialogue between friends these two pearls:""For whom are you sending your son""???, ""Behind whom is the dog running""?? If you want to have a complet and cheap aid to learn Russian you better by ""take off in Russian"" , which is sold here in Amazon."
1,How about a magnifying glass?,"I didn't get a chance to get into the content of the book due to the headache I got while trying to read the type print. The pages look as if they were stamped with an ink pad. The cover is of the same style as the other books by Cortina that I've read(French, German, Spanish), but the print is far, far inferior."
4,Awesome,I'm pleased with the looks of these gold balls. They are small but very nice looking under the fan. Highly recommend them.
5,Consistent straight answers,I spoke with Rita twice in person.She is the person she says she is. Months later I talked with her husband about dealing with my wifes MS.He spent at least an hour LISTENING to me ramble on and on.I even got some input from one of their daughters. These are christian people.Ive talked with Rita a couple of times lately and I truly believe her story.Very consistent with biblical principles. I really enjoyed her book and recently bought 10 more to give away. Cliff Martin
5,Helps during difficult time,"Twelve years ago a friend mailed this book to me. As I read it by the bedside of my terminally ill son (cancer,age 22), I realized that the book was describing much of what he was experiencing. While it was sad, it was also enlightening and strangely comforting. This is the second time I have given this book as a gift -- once to a co-worker whose mother was in the last stages of her life and now to a friend who is a Hospice volunteer. I hope this review will encourage others going through an end-of-life situation to seek it out."
5,Invaluable,"This book was an anchor during the most difficult time of our mother's dying. To be able to go to a resource that explained what was happening, both physically and spiritually, gave us a peace we couldn't have had otherwise. I've given this book to many since then."
1,VW Beetle Le'Bra,Very disappointed with this...the picture shows the stitched VW symbol...it does not have that on it & although it is suppose to fit tight...while installing it the material ripped! Just highly disappointed & feel like I've wasted my money!
3,Lebra,The fit was ok. Snug in some spots and a little loose in others. It is easy to install took only minutes and looks good. Quality is ok I am a little worried about how long it will last. Overall it is what I expected and I am happy with it considering the price. A good bargain don't expect top quality fit or finish but good.
4,One of the better Playboy videos out there,But I'd still recommend Girlfriends one over this. The women are definitly hot though.
2,noise,i've tried two different db converters in my 2008 jeep wrangler. I keep getting static or distortion from the woofer when i turm the volume past 17. Sometimes I get the same noise when the volume is lower. I dont want to change the head unit. I'll try a different converter before I get rid of the factory unit. i hate not being able to turn the volume up as loud as i want
3,eek...,"I pretty arbitrarily gave this three stars, as I didn't even finish watching this film. I just thought I would warn any fan of ""Nights of Cabiria"" that regardless of this film's own strengths, it is a pretty painful experience if you have seen and loved ""Nights of Cabiria"". Sorely lacking in poetry... Much though I like Shirley Maclaine, there is no way to compare her performance to Giulietta Masina's. Honestly, this film offended me pretty deeply, though I doubt it would have had I not seen the source first. Simplistic, to say the least, but then it's a musical isn't it?"
4,"Very good, underated film musical given OK DVD treatment!","I was eagarly awaiting this DVD. Univeral has presented the roadshow version of SWEET CHARITY on this DVD. Included is the Overture and Intermission music. However, Universal neglected or purposely omitted the Exit music following the end credits, The Exit music was included on a previous laser release. This was a big disappointment, otherwise a good DVD presentation."
3,Sweet Charity DVD,The DVD was as clear as the original motion picture. The colors were vibrant and the sound quality superb.
3,"Sweet Charity - Picture 4, Sound 4, Surround Sound .5",This is a favourite movie of mine. Considering the talent in the movie it has taken a remarkably long time to come onto DVD. Seeing the movie in widescreen again after 23 years was a thrill. The pictore on my 10' 'scope screen was bright clear and colourful. The sound quality was supurb.The only dissapointment for me was the lack of surround sound. The cover stated it was a 4.0 mix but listening to the rear channels you would not know it. In the production numbers such as The Rhythm of Life there were a large cast and lots of movement on screen yet during these numbers the surround channels stayed woefully silent.A marvellous release but with that one sour note.
4,It's not complete.,I wish the powers-that-be at Universal would go back and reinstate the exit music on the DVD. That would make this DVD perfect!
5,Amazing!,"Watch this movie!!!! Bob Fosse is a genius and Shirley MaCLaine is fabulous, it's impossible don't fall in love with her!!"
3,Sweet Snap Shot of the 1960's,"A film more for those who experienced the 1960's. A fairly light hearted musical flick with Sammy Davis Jnr being the show stealer in the ""Big Daddy"" number - one I remembered very well from a young child. The dance numbers are well staged and the costumes colourful (except for Miss ""Plain Jane"" Sweet Charity herself) - the totally impossible beehive hairdo's. So much of the music I knew - and that you'll probably will too - you never realized it was from this movie/show."
4,Shirley Maclaine shines in Sweet Charity,Enjoyed it but wondered if Gwen Verdon should have continued her stage role onto the screen. I remember a serious faux pas when Julie Andrews was bypassed for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady.
3,Shirley Maclaine Redux,"This movie version comes across as being severely ""dated,"" unlike many other well-made movie versions of successful musicals. It's a good account of Neil Simon's clever dialogue, but the cinematography misses most of the splendor of Bob Fosse's dance creations. It's better than nothing, I suppose. But, if given the chance, rush out and see any stage version first."
3,Sweet Charity,"My wife felt too much singing, not enough acting. She claimed the movie version see saw in the 1960's was talking, and not predominantly singing"
3,MISSING FOOTAGE,"I love the widescreen transfer, several bonus features, and the Dolby Digital 4.0 encoding, BUT the film is missing over a minute of a key scene! I wrote to Universal and they said this DVD is the ""complete, original, theatrical version"" and that the Laserdisc, VHS, and TCM broadcasts are of a ""later Road Show version"" of the film, which is incorrect.[...]"
5,costumes &daance at it's BEST,"Some of my favorite BOB FOSSE CHOREOGRAPHY combined with absolutlely perfect costomes by the phenomenal Edith Head. Shirly MacLaine is, as always lovable, funny, and awesome. And Sammy Davis Jr.'s number is one of my favorite songs in a movie. I own this beause it's filled with gems."
2,Not upto standard,"At first I thought I had hit a jackpot when I bought this quick fix Indian dish. But when I fixed it and served it to my family, the response was not very favorable. Here is a caveat: we cook our Indian dishes from scratch and our tastebuds are used to the home-cooked taste. That should explain why we did not give an enthusiastic thumbs-up for this dish.This can be a subsitute for the real thing once in a great while if you are stuck in a far off place with no Indian food at your disposal."
4,"One of his most poetic, romantic and visionary albums.","Jose Jose's cover version of Barbara Streisand's ""The Way We Were"" (""Nuestros Recuerdos"")is truly mind-blowing. He tackles both the joys and pains of love and romantic relationships on this album's songs in a very mature manner."
1,In General,"I cannot give this CD a true rating because the music is not calypso, it's poorly recorded and it does not reflect the artist as identified on the cover."
5,"Christmass Carrribbean Style,HOT",This is a super Hot christmas cd colypso style by the Mighty Sparrow.The Carribbean style Christmas medley is worth the price of admission alone..Get it NOW.
1,Wrong book,"I tried e-mailing the seller several times to either cancel the order or information on returning the book when it arrived. I realized it was the wrong book (which was my fault), but it could've been resolved had the seller returned my e-mails. So I'm stuck with a book I can't use."
1,Very Disappointed,"You'd think from the title that you might be able to use this video to help learn the violin. Think again.It shows Ricci from a camera angle in front of him and above him as he plays. That's it. Okay, can you at least see his fingering and bowing? No.The film is poorly focused and looks to be worse quality than most home video. The video isn't clear enough to see what the fingers are doing nor what string the bow is touching. As the fingers and bow move, all you see is a blur.What a waste of money. It only gets 1 star because that's as low as you can go."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!,"I bought this video as a gift for someone who was interested in learning how to play the violin. After she got it and watched it, she called me to see if there was a mistake. What a waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO! There must be something better out there..."
3,Outstanding violinist,"I saw the film partially and agree that the title is wrong.This film is for people interested in violin playingfrom a half professional point of view.Ricci is an outstanding musician and has hundreds of audio recordings.He wrote recently a nice book on violin playing: ""Left Hand Technique"" again for advancing violinists, not for beginners.The film gives a rare possibility not only to listen but alsoto see him playing an extremely interesting program.I put 3 stars for relatively low technical quality of the film.It is pity that some people wrote about the film agressively."
1,A DISASTER. SAVE YOUR MONEY. GOOD ONLY FOR TAPING OVER !,"I am amazed that Amazon even allows this thing on their list. It's a good example of what happens when someone who hasn't a clue about how to make an instructional film has a go at it. The bright side? You might sell the cassette for a dollar at a thrift store, where someone may find it useful for erasing and overtaping an episode of Mad TV.I wish it was possible to give it zero stars."
1,nothings available,It seems to me that someone would be making alot more money if these items were available at some point! thanks
1,WASTE,Please do not waste your money on this book. Most of the books content can be found on the internet FREE.I wish someone would have wrote an honest review before I wasted my money. You can buy this book and findout the hardway!
1,You have to pay Bose for replacements now,"I just called the above listed number at Bose to ask for replacement tips (they were falling off ALL the time, and I finally lost one for good today.)The customer service agent I spoke to says that they now charge for the replacement tips. $6.99 for a complete set.I am thinking of gluing the new set on."

3,They work good - but are so easy to loose,"I love these - they stay in my ears nice and securely, but they are endlessly unclipping off the headphones. I've already had to replace them two times because I've lost one or both. I would be much happier with these if they would secure a little better."
5,Exquisite Tempi!,"These performances are very justly paced, and the thematic thread of this music is never lost. That is a chief accomplishment in music like this with wandering, extemporizing elements constantly to be heard. It is almost a hackneyed thing to say that this regal sounding music requires elegance, but it does. Parmentier provides it mostly by insouciant attack and a complementary reserve. It has a been a long while since I have really enjoyed this music thoroughly, and I am looking forward to collecting many of Parmentier's recordings, now that it has become so clear that he is exactly the sort of performer who can make all sorts of things sound very fine."
1,Misleading book,"Attention! ""Selected lyrics"" means, to the author, in general, only two lines of a song lyric."
1,Insane and Scary,"I cannot stand this toy. It not only frightens my cats and my dog---it scares me. As I understand, it says, (at extremely loud volume) ""Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah nyah! Uh oh!"". It sounds more like, ""We're going to kill you! Uh oh!"". This seems to have been manufactured by some dark cat toy maker from Evilville who has no understanding of what amuses a cat. Thank you for making my dog hide under the bed!"
4,My cats love this and I can't stand it,"This is the feline equivalent of the Macarena. It is cute at first, but after about 15 minutes it is really annoying. I only bring this out occasionally because it is so irritating. The problem is that as much I as dislike it, that is how much the cats love it. I find this toy to be a great distraction for the cats when I need to get something done in another part of the house.Always hide this thing, or turn it off, before you go to bed. It is so loud that it woke both my husband and myself up the first night we had it when the furry babies decided to play with it after midnight.If the cats run your house, buy this product they will love it. If you are the ruler of your house (congratulations, please tell me your secret!) then leave this product at the pet store, it is darned irritating."
1,Uninteresting for cats; annoying for humans,"Initially, my cats were both a bit scared of the loud noises coming from the Cy-Purr Mouse. After their initial alarm, they have shown a complete lack of interest in this toy. The people living in my apartment, myself included, find the noise emitted by this product to be highly annoying (to the extent that I am relieved that the cats dislike it)."
4,For time alone.,"I purchased this CD about 3-4 years ago in a Native American shop. The shop owner was playing it at the time and I was entranced for the moment I walked in the door. Excellent background music or for those times when you just want to shut the world out with headphones. The flute is haunting and the beat is strong enough to elicit a toe-tapping response. Mildly repetitious at times, but the variety will keep you listening. Definitely a keeper."
1,Garbage,Bought it from homedepot to cut the carpet against my molding. It's a horrible design with 0 instructions. I returned it shortly after. You'll have better luck just hacking your carpet with a razor blade.
5,creditable mix of action and emotion,"""dysfunctional"" is becoming highly overused, but the hayes family puts the ""dys"" in dysfunctional! held my attention from first to last line despite the lack of truly sympathetic characters. looking for her next novel."
2,Ill-considered copy of Prince of Tides,"Sorry to disagree with the reviews but this is just a copy of Prince of Tides and poorly written at that. It is predictable from beginning to end and no explanation is given for the father's behavior. The general knowledge that this is, however loosely, based on a real family combined with Summers' too vague attempt at disguising the locality of the farm and ""Waterton"" has terribly hurt real people where I live near the farm."
2,The Title Refers to the Climax,"I really wanted to like this book and at times found myself engrossed in it. However, though purportedly based on real events, this book prodded on slowly to the obvious ""self revelation"" which was hinted at early in the book. The underlying themes of self-denial and family dysfunctionality never veer from the expected. Okay so it is ""based on a true event"". I, unlike some others on this page, am not asking for revenge at the end. Unfortunately, though, the totally unimaginative approach of this book led me at last to not really care what happened to Richard.E.W. may next time instead choose the lecture circuit or discuss the matter with a therapist"
4,cutting oil,This was just what I wanted. Was glad to be able to find it in such a small quantity for a reasonable price. Didn't need large amt. Good quality
3,Something missing,"Apparently there is a lot of hype over this band in the Belgium hardcore scene but I can't honestly see why. Don't get me wrong, this is a good cd, but some of the songs just drag on and on with the same riffing over and over again. Musically they sound like a slowed down version of Poison the well with some weird time changes and odd song structures to boot. The vocals are of your typical hardcore variety, though when it comes to melodic parts Course Of Action pull it off well. I think this is an album that will either grow on me to make me love it, or it will just annoy me to no end and will be at the used section of my local record store in no time. I suggest listening to this before purchasing just in case this isn't your thing."
3,Good books for overview people,"This book is a good one for people who need to be able to speak about PPP, MP, and L2TP and understand where they fit into products they sell or support.The section on ppp is not as good as the Carlson book, so if you can have just one book on ppp - this is not it.The chapter dedicated to l2tp was good, but not as good as the Shea book. More than a rehash of the standards documents, it occasionally enlarges on some implications of the standards that may not be immediately obvious.I could not understand at all why the bits on arp, ip, tcp, and so on were included. I would have dearly loved a more in depth discussion radius as it relates to MP and L2TP.Again, not a bad book, but lacking the focus and detail I look for."
1,Not a good book,You would be better off reading the standard RFCs 1661 and 2661.It is ok for an overview.
4,ED & Pete,I was very pleased to hear that Edo g had put out an album within recent times. Although the album is short (10 songs) each track is thorough. Even the tracks feat. artists are tight work. Ed's lyrics are nice and Pete Rock's beats sound really good as well. This cd is real Hip Hop. It is refreshing to hear something like this.
4,Decent Hip-Hop Album,"I remembered this album as I was prepping my Guru review. On My Own Worst Enemy is Ed O G's sixth studio album. The album is a straight up hardcore hip-hop album, no fluff, no strong attempts to be radio friendly. The album has instant street credibility and EDO.G doesn't shy away from the fact that he thinks that he is still on top of his game. As for EDO.G himself, he sounds pretty angry on some of the tracks, perhaps that is just his lyrical style. The production on the album is tight, the beats are crazy. Seven of the ten tracks on the album were produced by Pete Rock. Artists featured on the album include Diamon D, Jaysaun, Masta Ace, and Krumb Snatcha. The album is being released by Fat Beats Records."
1,Cheap flag,"Cheap material, low-quality. One of the metal rings was missing. Not perfectly rectangular. This should be indoor use only, and is not display quality."
4,Excellent condition for the price,"Only complaint would go to the folds created by packaging. Otherwise, an excellent item. The rep circle is slightly off center, but it's fine."
2,Nothing new for serious fans.,"If you're a serious fan of Queen (and specially of their older records), there's nothing interesting for you in this CD.It focuses mostly on putting into a single CD ""scraps"" of Freddie's own initiatives, and some new versions of old hits (I don't think it's of special interest to hear Elton John singing instead of Freddie).Newcomers to Queen should instead buy the Greatest Hits I or II, or the Classic Queen CD's."
3,Where's all the B-sides?,"I agree with most of the reviewers here that true Queen fans already own these tracks from ""Greatest Hits 3"" in some form from past Queen albums and solo projects. The remixes are a big waste of space especially when a number of remixes were included as bonus tracks on various albums when Queen's catalog was released by Hollywood records a few years back. What would really be cool is a CD of outakes, alternate versions and rarities. When oh when are we gonna get the numerous B-sides on CD (I Wanna Testify, A Human Body, Soul Brother, She Blows Hot and Cold, A Dozen Roses for My Sweetheart, etc.) Come on guys, there's plenty of stuff out there that's been recorded. Gift your loyal, supporting fans with something we really want. UNRELEASED MATERIAL! We miss ya Freddie!"
5,A True Classic,This album is a smooth mix of a truly great band -- Keeping Freddie Mercury's spirit alive!
4,"Greatest Hits, It's Not - But it is hot!","Several years after the death of Freddie, the remaining members of Queen are still trying to make a living in the music industry. I am not sure why since they obviously don't need the money. However, the strength of Greatest Hits III comes from the tribute songs with the help of Elton John and George Michael. The duet with Monserrat Caballe is brilliant! Suggest you check out the entire Bacelona CD if you are a huge Freddie fan! The remix of the classic duet with David Bowie is a real let down. I would rather see a release of old Queen songs with a new vocalist that can come close to the style and flamboyance of Mr Mercury. No, you cannot replace Freddie, but Brian, John, and Roger still have so much to offer! As Freddie would say, ""The Show Must Go On""!"
5,Queen becomes Alive again....,"What can i say, when i decided to buy this cd, i almost wanted to get it because of Living On My Own"" Freddie Mercury's rare disco music. The music really pops u up. But i thought Living On My Own will be 12 inch, but it was remixed again, i have 4 remixes and i wanted 12 inch. Anyways CD byitself is really great, the booklet also has a lot of pictures of past and new. And David Bowie+Queen Under Pressure new remix is in this disc, really nice, fabualious. The CD Single of David Bowi and Queen will be coming out Dec 14, in couple of few weeks, enjoy it!"
2,Queen III- the third coming,"I am a massive Queen fan and have been waiting for this CD's release for ages. Now the final product is out I am severley disapointed and I feel let down. No disrepects to the great Freddie but that is all that the CD is, it shouls be called Freddie and not have the Queen name on. It also features other artists from the Wembley show, this really is a disapointing album from the greatest band of all time, still it's Queen and well Queen Rocks!"
1,Don't waste your money!,This album is definately not what I thought it would be. Go with Greatest Hits 1 & 2 instead. You'll thank me later.
4,The sum of Queen's latter days,"""Greatest Hits 3"" bundles up Queen's hits from 1991 to present day (yes, they had hits AFTER Freddie Mercury died) with a couple of early tracks thrown in.It should also be noted that there are a few ""solo"" hits included here from Mercury & Brian May but shockingly none from drummer Roger Taylor.Wonderful collaborations with Elton John, George Michael & David Bowie are featured here (the duet with Bowie, ""Under Pressure"", is given the remix treatment - now with a dance beat even!)Unfortunately, a Wyclef Jean remix/cover was given a spot here and while I enjoyed the track, it has no business on a Queen album. The shame is it took a deserving spot from other classics such as the top 10 hit ""A Winter's Tale"".Regardless, this is a good companion to the 2 previously released Hits collections and are a must for any Queen ""newbie""."
2,Very Poor Choice,"This is such a poor album. Half of it is just made up of crappy remixes or SOLO songs.Granted, certain songs, such as ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"", ""Let Me Live"", and ""You Don't Fool Me"" are fantastic, and certainly belong on here.But they really could have done so much better in choosing songs for this album.As a true Queen fan, I say...please do not purchase this. The studio albums or pretty much any other Queen compilation album are so much better than this."
3,Queen: Greatest Hits III,"Queen: Greatest Hits III being a compilation with many of Queens hits and was released 1999. The problem is that many of the songs are sung by other artists and to hear queen songs with other singers make you realize what a great singer Freddie Mercury truly was. Elton John singing ""The Show Must Go On"" is painfully bad. Compare to the two prior compilations I and II this is more a tribute album then a greatest hits. The booklet includes linernotes for all the tracks and many fine photographs of the band. 3/5."
2,"Recycle, repackage, recycle....","I'm a long-time fan and this assortment is a dissapointment. It's kind of a compilation of the ""well, how about this one?"" songs. If you are a hardcore fan - you might want this to round out the collection. I would still recommend Greatest Hits 1 & 2 together if you must buy a compilation."
1,Only for Queen ultrasuperfans,"Only if you want to have all, but ALL of Queen. Buy it, but, don't wait so much, its only good. You must better buy the complete collection, here in Amazon."
4,Queen GH3- a few thoughts,"As a dedicated Queeniac, I was waiting for this album for a long long time. When I read the tracklist I was so let down I could cry. But then I got the CD in my hands and the reason I wanted to cry is not cause it's bad, but cause it's more of a personal act of respect to Freddie than anything else (defenetly not what us fans expected). There's nothing there that we didn't already know, except maybe The Show Must Go On with Elton John (listen to the boys play- amazing!), and the remix for Under Pressure which is brilliant! No, it was not made for the fans who are waiting for anything fresh from the boys, and no, it's not as brilliant as GH1,2, but we must not forget that little + at the title there, which leads me to think that John, Brian and Roger knew exactly what they were doing, they had a fair idea in their minds- now all that is left is for us to understand it."
4,Sends shivers down my spine...,"Queen put a lid to their extensive history. Though for some inexplicable reason, a disastrously embarassing version of Another one bites the dust by Wyclef Jean, has been included on this, there is enough material which confirms that Queen were in a class of their own - unrivalled - Beautiful melodies, powerful voices, THAT guitar - and These are the Days of Our Lives - need i say more? This is gonna sell like hot-cakes. PS: Why has Mother Love not been included as an extra track?"
3,Starts off strong but finishes rather weak.,"Definitely worth getting if you're missing Freddie and love Queen, like I do. Also some interesting surprises, some of which really kick and others fall flat. Get it; listen to it and then post your own review."
1,A WASTE OF 90 MINUTES,"A REFORMED GANG MEMBER [CHYNA] SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST HIS FORMER GANG, WHO BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE AND KILLED HIS SISTER AND HIS MOTHER. WHAT A WASTE. CHYNA [NOT THE FORMER WWE WRESTLER] IS SIMPLY BORING TO WATCH. KIND OF LIKE ''COMMANDO'', JUST WITHOUT THE EXCITEMENT. MACK 10 IS A VERY GOOD RAPPER, BUT HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ACT. THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A POORLY MADE HOOD MOVIE. DON'T PICK THIS MOVIE UP. IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY."
1,The title 'partition magic' is misleading,I cannot recommend this product since it does not live up to its title.Hans H.Vogt
4,Very Helpful!,"This is a great book to give you direction in your search for a job in recording industry. If you are just starting out, this is a MUST read!"
2,the parts I could watch were enteresting,The dvds pixalate a lot parts do not play skipped thru to see what I could watch. Very interesting but not good qualitly dvds.
4,Great Documentry,Really educational!! It evenly covers most of the Monarchs. My only wish is they would have spent more time with a few of the Kings....On some they sped through them too fast.
4,Monarchy by David Starkey,"This 5 part series is informative, entertaining and insightful. I have found that I need to watch each disc which has several 45 minute episodes several times to absorb all the data. I would highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in the British monarchy."
4,Worth the Price,"I was a bit skeptical as to how well this edger would perform. I own the Troy-Bilt TB90BC gas-powered (2-cycle) string trimmer, which this edger can attach to. Although the trimmer works reasonably well, I wasn't convinced the edger would have enough power to do the job.I have now used the edger several times around walkways, the driveway, and shrubs. I am surprised how well the edger performs. It has sufficient power for most of my routine yard work. The motor did bog down through unusually thick sections of grass next to the driveway. However, I was able to raise the blade (a nice and simple-to-use feature) and take a couple of slow passes. Now that it has been cleared out, I can keep the blade lower with no problems.For routine yard work, I recommend this purchase if you have a compatible unit. It's definitely worth the price as compared to a separate unit, and is much easier to use than the electric edger I replaced."
2,Ok if you don't have much side walk I guess....,"If you're sidewalk isn't badly overgrown, or if very short, you MIGHT be ok with this. I have a TB475 4 stroke weed eater, and it just wasn't enough power to do it without getting a permanent case of the shakes from holding the trimmer at full throttle (vibration) that long. If you have more than about 30 ft total to do, I would seriously consider finding a ""real"" edger. I found a 3.5 hp one used at a garage sale for 1/3 the price I paid for the attachment. Also, this item is made by MTD, which isn't exactly regarded as Gold Standard of quality and crafstmanship. Keep that in mind when purchasing also."
2,Would not recomend,I bought this edger attachment five days ago. I used it for a total of 75 feet before it stripped the ez-link on my trimmer. Now I can't use my trimmer and it was like new before. I called Troy-Bilt and their parent company MTD. They stated it was not their problem as my trimmer was no longer under it's 90 day warranty. I now have to either pay out of pocket to fix my trimmer or upgrade to a quality made unit.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this attachment with high hopes that it would give me a nice, clean, edged driveway and sidewalk with little effort. It did neither. Like someone else mentioned, it vibrated. A lot. And for what? The only difference I could see was dirt that had been thrown up onto my driveway. I've had better luck just turning my trimmer to the side. I ended up returning this item."
4,Troy-Bilt 7-1/2-Inch Blade Edger,Troy-Bilt 7-1/2-Inch Blade Edger Attachment #41AJLE-C966 Works great for straight edging . A lot harder to make curves . I do not regret buying it item
4,okay,"the attachment is good, but the trimmer it attaches to is just average. not much in the way of power."
1,Intermediate Accounting,"This book is sooo boring..... it makes my finance and economics books fun. It is by far the worst book: dry and confusing. As a matter of fact, after this class is over, I am goin right ahead and sell this book because it is worthless and pointless to have it."
5,Great phonne with a small quirk,"I have owned this phone system with 5 handsets for several years now and I love the system. It's sound quality is excellent as are all the features. Just one little ( OK two) quirks, when storing a number from someone calling to your phone there is no place or way of inserting a ""1"" prefix when storing to the address book,in other words you must write down the phone # then enter it manually with the prefix"
3,Too complicated.,"It's not very user friendly in terms of set up. I use my trusty Brother all-in-one as my primary landline, answering machine, and speaker phone."
1,No talking distance,"I purchased this phone with the idea in mind that I would increase the talking distance over my old 2.4 GHZ, wrong no different, still 50' is the best I can do, my old analog phone could go clear across the street and much clearer, digital phones are poor for different frequncies to transmit."
1,Does not work,"I ordered this phone a few months ago for use in my small business. Unfortunately, the phone works only sporadically. Sometimes when I call people they cannot hear me. Sometimes when people call me I cannot hear them and they cannot hear me. The auto-answer feature sometimes works and sometimes does not. I called Uniden, waited on hold for 20 minutes, and was hung up on. I plan to simply throw the phone away because it is not worth my time to wait on hold again, and I could not conscientiously sell it to someone else, given its defects.I would strongly recommend that you do not buy this phone."
5,The best Iv'e owned!,This phone is the greatest!I love the do not disturb button when I go to bed.The phone book is a terriffic feature.I love all the different rings I can use and assign to my phone calls. This is a solid phone.LOVE IT!
5,THE BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER OWED :-),"A friend of mine had this phone and I tested it out for two days the sound the range and everything was excellent. So i bought myself one. The only drawback is, if you have big fingers, this phone might not be for you. The keys are so small...perfect for my small hands. I would recommed this phone to anyone. The house that I live in everyone's conversation came through my old vtech 2.4 cordless phone....not anymore. I am happy with my purchase. I love the destinctive rings...so i can choose not to or to answer the phone by the sound of the ring."
4,Uniden TRU 8885 cordless phone/answering system,"I'm very pleased with this phone and answering machine. It has all the bells and whistles one would want, but not so many that it's overwhelming. My only problem is that I can't seem to turn the volume down."
5,"DIGNO DE ESCUCHARSE..., Y LO DIGO POR JOAQUÍN!","Algo que no se entiende es porque Joaquín , con su genialidad de cantautor, aceptó la invitación de una persona como un tal Fito, que después de aceptar la invitación se toma los derechos del disco como suyos en su totalidad, se cree un dios, y que disculpe la Argentina en su totalidad: No dejan de ser como son..., 10000 disculpas."
1,Sabina's worst record,"Out of character. In ten years Sabina will look back and shake his head. You've arrived at a low point. The need to preach that Paez exhibits is not your style. Predictable lyrics, forced music, rationed creativity... exhausting to listen to the whole ... thing. On top of it all, there is a song with political aspirations that shows no understanding of the situation, and trivializes both sides of the conflict. Trying to fly too high, you sink to your lowest."
1,"Life has no beginning and no end, apparently ........","I bought this cd on the basis of the previous review which was probably written by the artist or a close friend or relative. Sucked in!What you get is weak singing, weak lyrics (""In your heart, there is a light, when times are hard, it knows what's right""), weak synths and weak arrangements. You briefly hear her speaking and she has a nice speaking voice - maybe she should try spoken songs written by others."
1,Enough Already !,"I was very disappointed with this book. I understand that Dr. Joni Forest was a busy emergency Dr. I feel the author did an overkill on this. After about 5 medical emergencies I had had enough. This is why I say enough already. I liked the relationship between Joni and her best friend Randi, but this was overdone as well. This book did not go anywhere,it left me wondering about the main characters and their romance. Ms. Wright did not develop her characters, nor their romance. When I completed the book I wanted my money back. That's how unsatisfying the book was. Half of the book was about medical situations that Dr. Forest encountered at the hospital. Not enough about the characters. The couples relationship was a minor part of the book."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring",I found this book to be very unsatisfying. It didn't delve into what type of relationship the hero and heroine had. This book had no passion and no sparks. I would not recommend to anyone.
4,Better than the other two!,"The third and final book in the Underworld triology is fast-paced, exciting, and contains a wealth of surprises. Deeper characterization runs throughout the book with even some of the sideline characters being given more depth and development than the main characters were given in the first book.The good news is this is the best of the three. The bad news is a casual reader of vampire and/or werewolf fiction is probably going to come away disappointed because the entire triology shatters many of the conventions the genre is founded on."
5,Vivid and engrossing!!,"So many books based on movies are empty of original thought, but this volume breaks the mold.Greg Cox has taken Underworld: Evolution and brought it to life before many, myself included, have seen the feature film. Some might say knowing what is going to happen in a movie before you see it defeats the purpose of seeing the film, but that is definitely not the case here. All of Mr. Cox's vivid illustrations through words have given me a new appreciation for the first film and its upcoming sequel.The movie notwithstanding, I would recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy. You don't have to read the first book to understand this one, as there are flashbacks that bring the reader up to speed. Discover the trials and tribulations of Selene and Michael. You won't be sorry."
5,A great book that shows much more than the movie.,I loved this book because it suited my taste of novels to a 'T' and I would recomend it to all who have their 'inner dark side' hidden most of the time.
3,Follows the movie exactly...,If you liked the movie then you will like the book but this is written in an almost overly juvenile method with over emphasized descriptions of locations and scenery that leave nothing to the imagination. I read the first book in the series but I don't recall if it was the same author as it was so long ago. If it was he has totally changed his style because that book was far superior with more insight into the characters and lots of extra scenarios that were not in the original movie. This is a quick read though and it is entertaining again if you enjoyed the movie but if you are looking for anything extra you won't find it in this book.
3,Super Reader,"Underworld Evolution is basically one long chase-fight-chase-fight scene, so is definitely not as good as Underworld. There is no real politics, just a 'supernatural cleanup crew' whose job is to keep the whole vampire/werewolf battle out of the media as much as possible, and their own existence a secret.They use human agents, but it turns out their leader is the first immortal. Selene and Michael, with his help, must try and stop his sons, Marcus and William, who is part of the the chase thing. Marcus wants to free his brother William, the first werewolf from hundreds of years of captivity.At the end, it is a hybrid battlefest, with a helicopter."
5,Fantastic sequel,"The book followed the movie to perfection, but gave the reader an insight to what Michael and Selene are thinking. I loved the book and hope and pray that there will be another sequel to the best movie that I have seen in a long time."
4,A Thought Provoking Read,"This personal story, which must have been very difficult for the author to write made me think about the choices we each make in our lives and how often they are unconscious. He showed courage in relating events much easier to forget and shared the battle he faced in his continuing journey to make more conscious choices. I very much admire the time he spends today and over the past four years in reaching out to others at the Seattle Crisis Clinic. Part II of the book has wonderful poems and essays. I don't think any reader will come away without a good deal of introspection about their own choices."
3,A SPLENDID TROPICAL VACATION,"Set in Latin America, ""SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT 2002"" is the perfect antidote to, well, just about everything that's unsettling, disturbing and ugly. There's no story here, just a bevy of impossibly beautiful and seemingly natural young women in exotic locations posing for the annual ""Sports Illustrated"" swimsuit issue. Yamila Diaz-Rahi serves as on screen host in this slick production that tags along with 16 young women (including Josie Maran, Molly Sims, Heidi Klum, Shakara Ledars and Petra Nemcova) on their private photo shoots in Brazil, Guatamala, Costa Rica, Argentina and other Latin hot spots. This easy on the eye 60 minute digital distraction makes the case that if beauty is only skin deep, that is, indeed, deep enough."
4,Oh my,"WOW: Many years ago, I worked with this guy in NJ. I have an original tape he made at a local club. His skill on the guitar was remarkable. Better still, it was his own style. I can't wait to hear what he's up to musically. I had no clue he had gone pro. Oh, Mike: You get the 4 stars for prior talent on the six string. Go Mike Go.Cliff"
2,POOR,AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER I NOTICED THEIR SHIPPING WAS REALLY HIGH. I HADORDERED 1 SO I TRIED TO CHANGE MY ORDER TO MORE TO SEE WHAT THE SHIPPINGWOULD BE AND I NEVER COULD CHANGE THE ORDER.IT END UP COSTING ME MORE THAN I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT AT WALMART.
1,Weekend attempt to be a star!,Wow! Where did they get this garbage! The video is poor and audio the drifts off. As far as being instructional I suggest you buy a book. Waste of time!
4,Gift from a Student,"One of my students brought me the book The Van Laven Oath. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The book was engaging with its dynamic, round characters and its intriguing plot. It had many twists and turns that I did not anticipate. One way that I relax is by reading in bed. This book would not allow me to relax, however, because I did not want to put it down. I just wanted to find out what was going to happen next. I was highly disappointed when I got near the end and began to realize that it must have a sequel. I can only hope that my wait will not be long!!!"
5,Thrilling adventure,"This author has a captivating style of writing that grabs you from the beginning and has you hurling through the pages to continue the essence of this thrilling adventure. The author expresses her writing talent with such creativity and finesse, that you tend to believe she is only writing down the events as they take place. As mysterious events are unraveled throughout the story, you begin to view the elements of love and commitment from a different perspective. You become so engulfed, that you begin to ask yourself, if this really is a fictitious story, could love be so dangerous, is it that far from reality."
5,Excellent theatre,"This video is a joy if you love British theatre, which I do. It is also wonderful to see how incredible an actress Judi Dench was in 1961, and her further development in 1982. She has always been and continues to be brilliant. It is also interesting to see how changes were made to update the vocabularies used in the two performances, and the differences in interpretations of roles in the play by the various actors."
2,Boooooring,"I'm also a big fan of Judi Dench and I do not fault her acting in either of these productions, I watched both. I prefer the 1981 version, which is strange for me because I always prefer an older version of almost anything but the 1962 version was lifeless although I enjoyed Judi as Anya better then the Anya in the newer version . Also the sound was not very good on this DVD.This was my first Chekhov play and I guess his writing is not up my alley! (sorry Chekhov fans)I agree with the reviewer who said the story plot was hard to follow, dry, and DULL."
3,Very Displeased - Husband Says 2 1/2 Stars,"As an avid collector of Judi Dench movies, etc. I was very let down. There was so much hype in advertising this, I couldn't wait to see it. After receiving the DVD's we had to watch them three times before we could make any sense at all of them. Here you have the Stage Play, both the Originial and the New Version. I don't want to critique too strongly, I love theatres and stage Acting, going to broadway shows, but this reminded me of a night we went to a small town Community Theatre, and left half way thru the show. (( Please don't Misunderstand, it was really bad, others left also, I Love going to Community theatres ))I am not critiquing the Actors and Actresses, but the original Dry, Dull, Not Interesting, Yet Complicated Story Plot, which was very hard to follow. If a friend asked my opinion, I would tell them to look at a rental before they decide to buy it."
3,A good beginning for a great band,"As always, I did not enjoy this album on the first listen. I had to warm up to it, and its brevity really surprised me. It contains only 4 tracks and 15 minutes of music. The gem of the album is the title song. It shows Shadows at his vocal best and most musical. The other songs were more of the screamo type, and while they had their own real singing parts, the words are mostly unintelligible. No words were in the booklet that came with my copy (but it was used, so maybe there were pages with the words at one time?), so I couldn't ever sit and follow along with the booklet. The final track is regrettably short, as it has some decent merit that would be revealed in later albums.I don't listen to the album that often, but when I do, it's not a bad experience. I just wish it had a little more substance."
3,Not the volume I was looking for,"I blame this more om myself than the seller, although the pic did show the wrong volume, I was looking for volume 1 and mistakenly got volume 2, but I eventually bought ""The Great Book of Amber"" with all 10 volumes in the series, I am hoping to sell this book so that I can at least recoup some of the money I spent on it. At any rate will gladly do business with this seller again, and the price I paid for this volume was great."
4,Last chapter of a great career,"I have allways been a Bill Parcells fan, and reading this book gave me great insight into his football life. From cover to cover Parcells give a Tuna-eye view of a year in the life of a successful head coach. He pulls no punches, when in comes to player (Eric Green, LT, Ray Lucas), the Refs, and various members of the NFL (Bill Belichick). I found it very easy to read (3 days, if you are busy)and quite entertaining. For anyone who is a diehard Tuna fan, this book covers no new ground, yet you should read it anyway, for he interesting spin he gives."
2,A half-hearted effort,"I looked forward to this book with great anticipation. Bill Parcells and his legacy here in New England and how he left the team were front page news here. His personality is larger than life. His press conferences were must-see TV.That said, this book was disappointing. It started out well, the first portion of this book is riveting, and gives you real insight into his thoughts, and how he puts a team together. Where it goes downhill is after the Jets very first game of the '99 season where they lose multiple starters for the season, including the starting QB. Going into the season the Jets were considered by many people a favorite for the SuperBowl. If it were to follow the team through a season like that, it would've been a great read throughout. Instead, after those injuries, Parcells basically mails it in for the rest of the book, in my opinion. What could've been a great book instead becomes a mediocre effort."
2,Final season?,"i doubt Parcells is DONE with football as a coach.. I'm sure there will be PART 2 because this guy will coach somewhere sOON.As for the story it was easy ready and it was pretty cheesy. Nothing really BIG or personal described in the book. For a man as criticial as he is, I expected more DEEP thoughts in this book, but it never happen."
1,"Egomaniac, phony, and nasty person","As to be expected of Bill Parcells, this book is carelessly written. It provides no insights, nothing new, and is basically just a place for him to pound his chest. Parcells is an egomanica and a very nasty person. How may franchises has he left hanging. He will coach again, his ego will not let him not. Do not waste your money on this ""egogrophy"", its not worth the paper its printed on. I'g give it zero starts if i could."
1,Last Season. So?,"I guess you would have to be a huge Parcells fan before you could find a reason why this book was written. Then again, considering Bill wrote it, and the fact that it's his third auto-biographical book, I would chalk it up to either the money, or that he likes to talk about himself. Either way, he should leave the writing to the professionals."
2,Wow B. A. D.,"The lyrics are fun, the music isn't bad but the singing? It's like they aren't even trying. I think they recorded it in their bath tub. I wish they could have tried a little more with the singing cause I think I could have listened it with my daughter. Some of the lyrics and tunes were catchy but I think my dog can sing better ( I don't like to be but mean but ... whoosh!)"
2,Here we go again,"This is a cut-rate collection from EMI Nederlands affiliate Disky. It's part of a series. I have all these tracks, but at least it's better labeled than one of the same tracks purported to be Limahl's alone."
3,this is not the origianal columbia release of 'solo flight'!,"this is a broadcast recording of the band which lacks a lot in the quality department. if you want to sift through the bad recording, i'm sure there is some great playing. a recording of this kind doesn't seem to bother me with a robert johnson recording, but does on this."
1,dissapointment at it's finest,"After reading the back of the DVD case in suncoast I was kinda looking forward to seeing this, but let me tell you this was really not good at all. The Story is kinda hard to follow and really didn't get me interested at all. The action sequences were not all that good at all. The music was mediocre at best. This is an anime that you should rent and in all honesty never buy. In my opinion it is one of the worst anime's I have ever seen."
5,Trad Country Will Never Die!!,"I will keep this short and sweet. If you want your country music like it was in the good old days, then buy this album. Hank III channels his grandfather. Probably the finest country album I have heard in ages. I'll say it again, BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,REAL COUNTRY,"I bought HANK 3'S debut album in 1999 when it first came out and for 3 long, loooong years I had to wait for his sophomore effort ""LOVESICK BROKE & DRIFTIN... 3 WORDS: WORTH THE WAIT! I knew after the first song that HANK III had hit the nail on the head. THERE IS NOT ONE DUD ON THIS ALBUM. EVERY TRACK DELIVERS. While country radio is playing bubble gum, watered down, country pop artists, HANK WILLIAMS III is bringing country that's REAL AND RAW AND DOESN'T CARE WHOSE FEET IT STEPS ON. If you love Hank SR., I will give you a money-back guarantee that you will love his grandson just the same. IF YOU ARE NOT A HANK SR. FAN... SEEK THERAPY. If you do buy this album, LISTEN FOR THE HIDDEN TRACK AT THE END OF THE ALBUM. Also listen for track 4: LOVIN' & HUGGIN'; If that song doesn't make your feet itch, well, seek therapy. NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS ALBUM COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM THIS ""REAL"" COUNTRY FAN!!!"
4,"I can't wait until ""Straight to Hell"" comes out!","I love this album and I can't wait for III's new one! I was very disappointed when it was postponed.Not all of the songs on here are great, but there are no total losers, either. I disagree with people who don't care for his cover of ""Atlantic City."" I think it's excellent. In the first part of the song, Hank makes his character sound optimistic about the changes in the city, but, as the song goes on, he sounds more downbeat and disappointed. I think III's version of this song is one of the best.This is an excellent CD of real country music!"
5,the title says it all.,"He`s singin about my life. Great stuff in this album, wish i had recorded it. Best damn country music I`ve heard in a long time!"
2,Wasted bucks and wasted nights,"Oh well I have the same right to make a lame ryhmn in my title as Hank does in most of his songs. How any one can compare him to his grandfather is beyond me. The only redeeming quality to this album is the music. Right when one says,"" great this song is going to be the one to make me feel that I might have spent my money well on this album"", Hank trites it out by saying some thing about his momma and prison. Gramps is rolling over in the grave. Terrible. Save your money. He slams Nashville but doesn't give us what we want. And please no one- not even compared to Waylon."
5,Need to review C&W,"I want to be clear that I absolutely hate country music. I am one of those that likes Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, Patsy Cline, and of course Hank Williams Sr. But the stuff in between then and now pretty much just annoys me. So when a trusted friend told me I had to hear Hank Williams III I was a little put off. He came over and put on Lovesick, Broke & Driftin' and I was amazed. No disrespect to anyone but it seems talent skipped a generation in that family. He has everything his grandfather has. It gives me chills how much he both looks like him and sounds like him and has his style (but not copied). I say run don't walk and buy this cd. I do not care what kind of music you like (I generally only listen to pre-85 hardcore punk) this will hook you. So stop reading this and buy it immediately!!!"
5,Don't Miss Out!!,"If you are any kind of a fan you need to meet Hank III. He is the only country I will buy. I saw him in Ft. Collins CO. , at the Starlight. You will never beleive it if you see him in concert. Buy this CD. You won't regret it. And you can turn your friends on to him, as some are still in the dark about Hank III and the unbelievable music he makes."
5,Hank Williams,Hauntingly Awsome Sounds Like His Granpa Man I Sure Hank SR I LookingDown And Smiling This Guy Is The Real Deal Sweet CD
3,Not As Good As His First.........,"Hank III recorded a great first album entitled, ""Risin' Outlaw"".After hearing this album, I was somewhat disappointed. It lacks the twang that Hank put into the first solo album. Maybe I'm expecting too much of his grandfather's vocal's; I don't know. I do know that it is not as good as the first. I guess I would have to say that one of the best song's on the album is, ""Mississppi Mud"".Hopefully in the future, there will be more of a country based sound."
3,slummin',"This guy is trying too hard to make us believe he's been down and out. I liked his first album a lot, but this is more like fakin'it. Still, there's a real old-fashioned tear jerker here, called ""5 shots of whiskey"". And that isn't bad at all. So just keep on makin' them records, Shelton. You've got something comin, when you downplay the slummin' bit. Try understatements instead of wearing every bad xperience up front."
2,Not My Style of Country,"I'm a big fan of Outlaw and Texas Country, however, still album was not for me. Hank III is too raw, too basic, and too lacking for me. However, he does have a very unique sound and style and I can't think of anyone else out there that he sounds like. Still I'd be cautious about buy this CD and listen to the song samples that Amazon provides."
2,Not too many bright moments...,"Just because you have the family name, doesn't mean you should be in the music game, some wise man once spoke, oops that wise man was me, lol, hahahahaha. But reaLLY this is not one of his strongest efforts, try his debut cd, or his later stuff, but this cd is mostly forgettable, but for fans it has it's moments and will be worth acquiring, to those already familiar to the 3rd of the Williams'"
5,The Fly on the Ceiling is a CLASSIC Myth!!,"This easy reader combines history, laughs and math. Teaching the Cartesian Coordinate System, this book lends itself to great classroom teaching and learning. Try having your kids or students play ""Battleship"" after reading!!Powerful illustrations too!Bravo!I bought a class set for my classroom!"
2,Doesn't work,"This was a neat looking skin for the GameCube. Unfortunately, it did not stay on and kept falling off. Short of super gluing it there is no way to keep it in place. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
5,terrific tools for the price,I ordered these when my husband said he needed tools to take to our cottage. I was very surprised when they arrived - they are wonderful quality - especially for the price. Nothing flimsy here - the tools are strong and long and a great choice for grilling.
2,Why positive reviews?,"The tongs, spatula and grill brush are OK. They are nothing special, but work fine. The fork, as another reviewer pointed out, is the weak part of this set. The tines of the fork are so weak they can easily be bent. I am sure there must be better sets available at this price."
2,4 piece Charcoal Barbeque set,"I was hoping for more from this product. The tools are not strong enough, the fork tines bent when I used it to help move a steak over on my barbeque grill. Disappointing"
1,Always crashes.,"This is going to be a very quick review. I use this program every day at work, I am an audio engineer. It is quite possibly the worst program I have ever worked with. Any time you call the tech support number you're on hold for at least 20 minutes, they can barely help you, and the manual lacks SERIOUS details.The programs I make are usually contain 10 to 12 tracks and and range between 8 and 14 minutes. This program crashes on me about 4 times a day without any real reason.Do yourself a HUGE favor, save up a little more money if you must and buy avid pro tools, or adobe audition because cakewalk is not worth it."
4,Dating is not a crime!,"While parts of the book are a bit sleazy...the principle of the book is well thought out and should be put into practice. Today, I know very few singles who have ever dated ... they ""relationship"" and call it dating. These ""relationship"" people tend to be boring and are insecure because they are afraid of being juggled. Men who ""date"" more are more creative, fun, and learn more about what they are looking for.... I recommend every single guy out there should at least try to juggle once! It can be fun, and exciting!"
1,A book for desperate individuals,"My roomate was given this book and I read it because I thought it might be funny. Then I realized it was funny but in a bad way. I found it hilarious that the behavior described in this book is supposed to be cool. The only male who would put this much effort into this facet of his life obviously doesn't have a whole lot going on. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book, which seems to have been written for sadly desperate individuals."
1,was hoping for an epic story that was a tribute to classic marvel,was very disappointed it was like a really bad version of watchmen and had little to no development and the end was just a disappointment. No crazy ww2 battles nothing but alot of pointless talking and a pointless ending. the only thing i liked was the art but it's not worth the money to spend on art alone.
4,I enjoyed this book,"While this book is a short (152 pgs) one-shot, it was easy to quickly get into the characters. They are essentially arch-types (at first) of characters many readers have seen before.The art is very good, and fits well with the tone of the book. While this isn't the first book to take on a more realistic take of the golden age comics/characters we're familiar with, B. Clay Moore does a particularly good job here. My only gripe is that I think the plot warrants a somewhat longer book, although you do get your money's worth with this one."
2,Mediocre - Whats the point?,"Super heroes are assembled for a task force to help fight WWII. Some of them get offed. The government does shady things. Things get covered up....Sounds like a bad episode of the X-Files or something....Its all been done before in all mediums. There was nothing new with this one really. I give it two stars because I think the art was pretty good. I liked the heavy use of darker colours to set the mood, buts all this has going for it."
1,Get something else,Very frustrating to watch. Provides only bits of information at a time then cuts to other scenes mid sentence. Leaves you hanging and dependent on looking stuff up online. Get another video series or watch other How to videos online. I give it a one star because I can't give it a lower rating.
2,Not the best book on this subject,"Others have already said it better than I can, so I'll be brief. There's far too much ""Starkey"" in this book and far too little history. His unprofessional habit of attacking other historians undermined his credibility and too many of his conclusions are unsupported. I could have passed on this weak presentation of an already well-covered subject."
2,Better than Nytol,"This book is a great cure for insomnia, unless if you find yourself so annoyed by Starkey's ""tone"" that you can't sleep.In his zeal to show the depth of his research, Starkey quotes some passages from the historical record that leave the reader wondering why--why was that detail important, why struggle to work it in to the narrative, and finally, why isn't there a stronger narrative thread?Starkey's continued insertion of his own opinions is rather irritating. The repeated use of first-person is also annoying.He has plenty of facts, but what's lacking is an engaging way to tie them all together and make the audience's interest last through all 850 pages."
3,A mixed bag,"I find this book difficult to review. It is very well-written; David Starkey's prose is clear and forceful, and I find his conclusions plausible. On the other hand, I was troubled by his intrusive bragging (look what I've discovered, aren't I a clever boy?) and his frequent trick of surreptitiously passing off his own interpretations as established fact - and vice versa.I found myself frequently snickering at his 1950s-era view of these queens' illnesses as primarily neurotic in nature, often in contradiction to the facts of the matter. (For example, he has Catherine of Aragon wasting away due to her own neurotic refusal to look after herself; medical historians, on the other hand, are confident that she actually died of cancer of the heart.) In contrast, he presents Henry's medical problems as all deriving from either his age or as a result of manly activities, yet the king was a textbook hypochondriac."
5,Good Read,"Well written. Factually accurate. If you are interested in Henry VIII, this is the book for you."
2,"Big book, ultimately a disappointment","Looking, as I was, for the definitive volume on Henry VIII and his wives, Starkey's book was ultimately disappointing in spite of its heft. To spend two-thirds of the book on Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, although Starkey clearly found them the most worthy of interest, left the other fours wives' personalities and histories undeveloped and colorless. Thanks to Starkey, we now know every possible detail of the Henry/Catherine divorce, both from Catherine's and Anne's perspective. but very little about their relationships with Henry. For example, with all the pages devoted to Anne, why do we not have a clearer understanding of the disintegration of the Boleyn marriage? How did a woman who was the object of Henry's unbridled passion come to be beheaded a mere three years after marriage? I, for one, would much rather know more of their personal history. How can a book on such a fascinating subject be so dry?"
2,"In depth study of Henry's motivations, Catherine of Aragon","I agree with another reviewer who felt that this book sets a tedious pace that is frequently bogged down by constantly rehashing the ups and downs of Henry's divorce trial, first from Catherine of Aragon's point of view and then Anne Boleyns. While the amount of material regarding Catherine of Aragon is enormous the writer does stop often to compliment himself (tasteless) and by the time Anne Boleyn comes on the scene the reader is exhausted."
2,Utterly boring,"I have never been able to put a book down before on Henry the VIII and his wives. After struggling to finish this book of exhausting but uninteresting detail, I thought I would sell it on Amazon, a first for me. But then, after checking, I learned it was only going for 87 cents. Why am I not surprised?"
4,Invicta Mens 10,"This is my 5th Invicta - It is the one I wear the most, because it was the lease expensive. First, this is a smaller watch(I believe 40""). Second, the bracelet while still stainless steel is of a lower quality than the $130+ Invicta's. Third, the blue is NOT half as vibrant as the picture suggests. Fourth, the stem is kind of cheap looking compared to all other Invictas I have seen. Now for the positives, it looks decent and I have had several comments made about the watch. It does have a sapphire crystal and the battery is suggest to last for ten years. It is made with swiss parts and is engraved on the back - Having said that, I'm positive it is not assembled in Switzerland. Overall, I would certainly suggest this watch - it looks good, seems to keep time well and is water resistant to 100 m"
4,"Good Value, better product",This is the second Invicta watch I own. These are good watches. I will buy a few more too. I am interested in seeing this battery last 10 years too. Buy one if you like a good watch at a good price.
2,"Smells great...if you're 150 years old, a.k.a. not smelling the roses anymore.","Maybe it's just the 0.14oz size but holy moly! It smells like perfume that has been sitting on your great great grandmother's dresser for the last hundred years and now smells faintly of something that may once have been nice but now just has a potent, hideous old stench."
1,broken,"The tumbler arrived broken, and one of the two matching tissues boxes was chipped. They need to reconsider their packing."
1,"Great, but . . .","I love the design, the look, how it feels to hold and sip from, but I was hugely disappointed to find that this pottery piece was made in China. This is after I've made a point of getting rid of bowls and returned dish sets made in China in the last few years because of the dangerous chemicals used in manufacturing food pieces by small Chinese factories.I WOULD FEEL A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF AMAZON WOULD INCLUDE THE COUNTRY OF MANUFACTURE IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION."
4,"Delicious recipes, but not very healthy","I've used a number of recipes from this cookbook and have been mostly pleased. There are some nice deviations from the typical ingredients, including a few vegetables and grains I hadn't used before. The green bean and red pepper dish has become a staple in my home, and some of the other recipes inspired me to try different casserole dishes. Overall, I think it's a nice addition to my little cookbook collection.However, most of the recipes in this book are very high in calories and fat. The author uses a LOT of butter and cheese--practically every recipe calls for a tablespoon or more of butter and mounds of cheese. Yes, you can cut back on these high fat additions and substitute oil in some places, but overall I would not call these recipes particularly healthy. I use most of the recipes only occasionally because of this."
5,favorite cook book,"I own almost 50 cook books, and this is my favorite. The recipes are quick, unique, and delicious. I recommend this book to all of my friends. You don't have to be a cook to follow the extreemly easy directions. The author did a great job. No pictures, because there's no room. It's jam packed with delicious meals yet-to-be!"
4,I've cooked nearly 75% of the recipes...fun & easy!,"I would have given this 5 stars, except that occasionally the recipes aren't so quick and some are a little high in fat. For example, if you decide to choose brown rice for a recipe, that takes 45 minutes to cook (so it isn't really quick.) Some of the desserts skyrocket with fat. If you know how to do subsitutions and/or if you don't mind going a little crazy occasionally, they have ALL been delicious so far. My hubby frequently asks for repeats of his favorites."
4,Veggie Pleasures,The recipes are luscious and I'm going to try to incorporate them into our not-so-vegetarian lives.
1,"Quick, easy, and great food!","This book is great for the guy that is not a cook, yet wants to try and eat a little healthier."
1,Re-issues are are great! Not all are worth the effort.,"Maybe Ms. Lowell has a certain fondness for this book, or its characters. I certainly hope so. I feel it is one of her weaker efforts. Otherwise I would have to assume that it is purely a marketing ploy. I recomend all of Lowells books but this one. I have read over 20 of them, take my word for it she is still the best! P.S. try any western, or the jewel series if you prefer contemporary."
1,A reader from PA. thought that this book was terrible.,"I had previously read Elizabeth Lowell's other books Amber Beach, etc. and thought that when I saw this book in the book store that it would be good. What a waste of money and time. It was a real disappointment."
3,Unbelievable!,"Elizabeth Lowell is one of America's finest romance writers. Remember Summer is not one of her best efforts. I am grateful for the opportunity to read one of her earlier works, but even more thankful that I have read her other more recent works and know that Remember Summer is not characteristic of her talent. From the beginning the characters, the conflicts, and the resolutions were all unbelievable."
2,"Repetitive, Unbelievable, and Poorly Written","A reprint of an older book, Remember Summer is a bid by the author to capitalize on her success and name recognition without doing the work of writing a novel up to her current standards. The story premise is interesting but the execution is rough. A better editor would have cleared up the glaring repetition and plot inconsistencies. Despite the sometimes ridiculous dialogue and unbelievable interactions of the characters, horse enthusiasts will find a lot of Olympic action and detail to distract them from the cliched romance and graceless writing style."
2,Slow and boring!,"What a total waste of time. This book was so slow. The 2 main characters didn't even have a date until page 100. The first time they had sex was page 230. It was long, boring and tedious. Not a good Elizabeth Lowell book. It amazes me that the same author wrote ""Where the Heart Is"" which was such a fast paced, action filled, passionate, enjoyable book. Skip this one."
1,If you're lucky you won't remember this book,"Not at all up to the standard I expect from Elizabeth Lowell after the Amber Beach, Jade Island, etc. series. There is no plot, just a lot of hormones, and a lot of angst. After I finished it I was not surprised to learn that it was an older novel re-released.Suggest you spend your money on some of her newer titles and let these ones rest in peace."
1,A disappointment from one of my favorite authors,"I usually love Elizabeth Lowell, but this book was definitely not one of her finer efforts. The plot goes beyond farfetched, the characters are not very likeable, and the romance is not even interesting. Save your money and try the Only series or the Donovans, either is much, much better."
5,Remember Summer THE BEST,"Of all the many Elizabeth Lowell books I have read, this is my all time favorite. The love story between Cord and Raine touches deep inside your heart. The description of the Olympic Event makes you want to jump on a horse and start riding. I have read this book about 20 times and will probably read it about 20 more."
3,Dissapointed a bit,"I really like Elizabeth Lowells novel ""End of Earths"" but I didn't like this. I'm not fond of horses at all. I was expecting another touching novel but this one isn't. I've seen better."
3,I Don't Understand,It doesn't make sense to me. This was a band who put out around 20 songs on each album and all they put on the greatest hits is ten songs. Why? This simply is not worth the time and it makes me wonder if it was just some corporate money maker who decided on the tracklist. Sure all the included songs are great but they don't represent the true essence of Sublime and this piece of money making junk is not worth it. I'll give it three stars in honor of sublime's brilliance but this is not what a greatest hits should be.
5,Sublime - The Greatest Band Ever,"If you are looking for a taste of Sublime, this is a great CD to buy. These are some of the best songs written. I own 6 Sublime CD's and all of them I rate with 6 stars. This CD is great for new Sublime fans, to know which Sublime CD you want to buy next. The video's are really great too, and you get a fold out poster. This is a fantastic price for this CD. I really recommend that you make this your CD, (then try 40 oz. next.) Brad Nowells voice was truly Sublime."
2,Not much of a Greatest Hits,"As much of a Sublime fan I consider myself to be, I am not quite sure who picked out these songs...Date Rape is perhaps their worst song on any album, and there are so many great ones off 40oz that they couldn't put on here, it is a sham to call this a greatest hits...well, I guess as far Bradley was concerned, thanks to this CD (that I'm sure) the rest of the guys didn't want to put out, rock-stardom is theirs and now the only thing to follow is a presidential bid..."
5,This CD is awesome!,"Sublime is one of my favorite bands, and this is one of their best CD's. My favorites are ""What I Got,"" ""Wrong Way,"" and ""Date Rape."" It features catchy, alternative-rock tunes that are easily locking into one's head. All the songs are good, but it could have been a bit longer. The CD only has 10 songs, and the time is under 30 minutes. The CD also featues two videos, ""What I Got"" and ""Wrong Way."" I haven't seen them, though, they won't play on my computer. I'm sure they're good, anyway. This CD is a must for any Sublime fan. Also, if you like bands like Green Day, Lit, and Blink 182, you should like this."
1,Yet another attempt to cash in,"You'd figure a ""greatest hits"" album from Sublime would be more than a whole 10 tracks, but this compilation is nothing more than a blatant cash in by the record company. Naturally it features ""What I Got"", ""Santeria"", ""Smoke Two Joints"", ""Date Rape"", and ""Doin' Time"", but when one goes slapping a greatest hits title on a Sublime disc, you'd figure that songs like ""Don't Push"", ""Waiting for My Ruca"", ""Jailhouse"", ""Romeo"", ""Same in the End"", ""All You Need"", and ""Greatest Hits"" would be included, but they're not. Only the songs that got the most play and press are here, and even for casual fans they will be wishing more was on here. All in all, this isn't even good for an introduction to new fans, if you want to get into Sublime start with ""40 oz. to Freedom"" and then go on with the rest of their catalog, and leave this coaster in the dust."
5,if you like sublime you'll like this.,"True put to many songs from the self-titled, true they should have put more from 40oz, but it is still a good CD. For those of you complaining they shouldn't have put this out. There's a reason for it. When Sublime signed w/ MCA the contract stated they had to put out 5 CDs, thus we have SHS, Bradley Nowell and Friends, Stand By your Van, Greatest Hits, and of course you got the self-Titled. Great album, if you are a true sublime fan you'll get it."
2,"I love Sublime and these songs, just not the cd.","All in all i'm going to be brief. I'm really angry that this thing was even packaged, it's meant to capitolize on the death of Brad Nowell which is a really sad thing. Brad is my favorite singer ever and this music is by all means great, but instead you'd be much better off buying 40 Oz. To Freedom, Robbin The Hood, and Sublime. The real cds.This thing is just a rehashing of a meager ten songs and misses out on a lot of their greatest songs like Rivers Of Babylon, Right Back, Seed, Same In The End, Boss MC, DJs, etc....You can't package a band that is as good as Sublime into 10 songs and call it their ""greatest"", they're too good, every one of their songs is great and this lacks a ton of my favorites. Pick up the first 3 Sublime cds, the acoustic and live cds, and the DVD, avoid this."
3,Response to another Review: They were making money before!,"I am sorry to see that Sublime has released another album of tracks that are already recorded, but I still don't think that they are ""cashing in"" on Bradley's death. I say ""BOO"" the man that claims they are. I read a review that claimed Sublime had made no money before Bradley's death, this is a complete lie and if he really knew the band, he would know that they were HUGE in So.Cal. and that they were being played by kids everywhere. They had already released 40 oz. and Robbin' the Hood before the self titled album had blown up, and these albums made them quite a bit of money. The reviewer in question should stick to reviewing bands that they are familiar with so that in the future he doesn't make himself look like a jackass!"
5,The Ultimate Sublime Fan,"I have all of the Sublime CDs and yes, I have every song on this track. I am still going to buy it, though, to add to my collection. Skunk Records could do a lot better, I agree."
5,"great songs, but they're all previously released","What I Got - Self Titled; Wrong Way - Self Titled; Santeria - Self Titled; 40 oz to Freedom - 40 oz to Freedom; Smoke 2 Joints - 40 oz to Freedom; Date Rape - 40 oz to Freedom; Saw Red - Robbin' the Hood; Badfish - 40 oz to Freedom; Doin' Time - Self Titled; Poolshark - Robbin' the Hood; As you can see all these songs have been released on full length (original) cd's already. i don't know what the videos are at the end, i assume they are the music videos for what i got and wrong way. if that's the case, this might be worth buying just for that. but if you're looking for sublime's greatest hits just buy all their albums. trust me, you won't regret it."
1,DoNotBuyThisCD,"I find it hard to believe that someone would put a meager ten songs on a CD and call it Sublime's greatest hits. The cds made while Nowell was alive are some of the longest cds you can buy (40 oz. to Freedom is more than 69 minutes long), and it is a disgrace to his memory to try and sell such a short cd as Sublime's greatest hits. The self-titled cd and 40 oz. to Freedom both have more of their great songs than this cd! Now, all the songs on this cd are awesome, but if you want their greatest hits(which you should), buy one of those cds. I would personally suggest buying all of their other cds(don't forget Bradley Nowell and Friends-Acoustic), but if you can't afford that, just get 40 oz. or Sublime, but do not buy this cd. Sublime is awesome, but this cd is simply not long enough."
3,Shamelessness Is not a Virtue,"Listen, I am a die-hard Sublime fan so this weak radio hits CD does nothing for me. If you just want a CD with all the Sublime hits you know from the radio, then this is the CD for you (though it's only 28 min.). If you want to hear a testament to the true genius of Sublime, and incidentally 2 of the 90s greatest ska/punk/reggae CDs, (even though that genre is now a cliche) then do yourself a favor and check out the absolutely crucial ""Sublime"" and ""40oz. To Freedom"" CDs."
4,Toss Up,"I do not own this cd but I do own all of sublimes other cds. This cd would be good for you people who like sublime a little and would like to just buy one of there cds. It contains only there ""hit singles"". For you die hard sublime fans, this is not the cd for you. It is mainly for people who only care about there hits and not all there underground ""classic"" songs."
4,Greatest Hits,"I gave this album only 4 out of 5 because the lack of songs. I think every song on this disc is awesome, but just 10 songs? I mean theres so many other great songs! my personal favorites are Santeria and Smoke Two Joints. This Cd is probably great for people who just like Sublime for What I Got and Wrong Way because it mostly hase the singles. this probably isnt a album for you if you're into the old stuff from robbin' the hood and 40 oz. to freedom. overall i like this cd but i can only wish it had more songs."
2,greatest hits?,"I'll keep this short. Sublime is an awesome band, but calling this 10-song disc their ""greatest hits"" is a travesty. There is so much more to sublime, even for the mainstream fan who only knows their radio songs. To see what they have to offer, check out all of their CDs."
3,"Great songs, but too short","Sublime is one of my favorite bands of all time and every song in this collection is worth having, but I don't think it had close to all of the best sublime songs. This cd is only half of what it could be. If you like sublime or are beginning to like them, pick up either 40 oz. to Freedom or the self-titled album for a full listen of the bands true potential. This cd does not accurately show the full capabilities of this talented group."
4,simply great!,"Sublime's music is just amazing, and you can't get all of it just within this album. It's the first Sublime CD I had, and the songs are all oustanding, but familiar (all played on the radio extensively.) I'd definitely recommend this CD but their other albums (Robbin' the Hood, 40 oz. to Freedom, and self-titled) would be a much better buy."
2,only 10 songs!!,"Why buy this pseudo best of with only 10 songs, when you can get an album twice as long, and at least as good for the same price. There are so many good sublime songs that 10 isn't even an introduction. If you really want an intro to Sublime try the album Sublime; I'm pretty sure most fans won't agree with me but it's one of my personal favorites. Anyway fans would agree that Sublime the album is by far superior to this! this shouldn't be called a greatest hits. Please pay some respect. Moreover, even if all the songs are good individually, they really don't make a satisfactory whole; a no go."
4,Ultimate Sublime STARTER kit,"To hardcore Sublime fans dont bother with this cd. Yes the songs on this album(if you can call it that) are pretty good songs but this is only a taste of the Sublime ""mainstream hits"" For you sublime newbies this is a great starter cd. Then after you listen to that a little and get a feel of sublime's style you should go pick up the other sublime cd's starting with the latest. Ultimately this is just a cd that lacks all the great songs like ""Burritos"" ""dont push"" and ""pawn shop"" which isnt even close to the tip of the iceburg for this Long Beach native band. And if you have all the sublime cd's dont get this unless your collecting."
2,Where are the rest of the hits?,"This is a pathetic excuse of a Greatist Hits cd. Come on now. 9 and a half songs. We can do better than this. Wheres Dont Push or Caress Me Down? What about Same in the End, Ball and Chain, and KRS One? Im confused by the title of the cd. Sublime had more than 9 hits. This is a weak excuse to sell more Sublime. Skunk, get it together."
3,"Please... do yourself a favor, don't just buy this!","Okay, I can't believe they actually released a Sublime Greatest Hits. I can see a greatest hits album for a classic rock group with 25 CDs, but Sublime? With 2 full CDs? Get ""40 oz. to Freedom"" and ""Sublime"". Trust me. The entire albums are great, and the songs go with each other really well. It's almost like taking Pink Floyd's ""Another Break in the Wall"" tracks and seperating them, it doesn't sound as cool. They really skimped 40 oz. to Freedom on this one as well, believe me it's a better album, and taking the ""What I got"" and ""Wrong way"" VIDEO songs as the last two tracks was a big mistake, c'mon now... you mean to tell me that 40 oz. had 2 or 3 good songs? Hmmm... I don't think so. Don't buy this album if you like Sublime, you'll thank me later."
1,Dont waste your money...,"If you really want a Sublime Greatest Hits collection, your going to need to buy every one of their CDS. Almost every song the've written should be on this CD, and these 10 aren't even their 10 best... not even close, this is a rip off, dont waste your money."
3,Hard to tell if this works but....,"This is a very thick olive oil-y liquid. Fortuantely my son loves olive oil and lemon lime, which this is flavored with. I imagine that some kids would not want to take this but if you can get them to, it's a great source of omega 3's if nothing else. Very difficult to gauge if this helps the attention span but it's worth a try if you're also implenting other non-pharmaceutical solutions."
5,"Oh It is, what it is........","exercise its not one of my favorite things todo , but I must say mashing sex, sexy girls and real exercise facts together - sure makes this my fav new Hobby. The video is a must to start my day, not only a quick work out but boost my mood with the witty comments thru out the video and its not boring like most work out videos, thats a SURE thing."
4,A Book Review,"The book The Amazing Days Of Abbey Hayes, Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining is about a girl named Abbey who starts to play soccer. Abbey wanted to be a soccer star. She also starts to play because of her perfect sisters and her very smart brother. One of the sisters is very sporty and the other one is super smart.In this book it teaches you the lesson to never stop trying even if something is in your way.The main characters are Abbey, the little brother, the mom and dad, and Abbey's two twin sisters Eva, and Isabel.My opinion about the story is that it is interesting, life like, and is never sad. My favorite part is when Abbey meets a new student and the new student becomes Abbey's best friend.If you have not read this book you really need to.This story inspired me to never give up and to keep on moving forward."
1,Its Horrible,"In one of your dumb books, its like, ""Writing in your journal, hon?"" thats just so incredibly... Argh! And then you got, And then, Abby wished for the thousandth time, she could get her ears pierced! Oh, oh, oh, and then, the journal! AHHHH! HORIBBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its like, i will do it! that just sounds wrong. i think Anne should give up. i cant point out every bad thing in her books. there are just to many..."
1,DONT BUY,"I was impressed with the charger for about 1 month---than it stopped charging the NiMh batteries it came with. I took it back to Best Buy only to find that ALL of the Rapid Chargers on thier shelf did not work either. A sales person and I tested them all, hoping I would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked.It was more disappointing after calling Kodak ---they were unable to replace it or get my money back. I thought purchasing a Kodak was a smart decision, however, they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing."
1,dont buy!,"I am on my second charger, and this one is broken now also. I thought that it was just the first one that I purchased, but it is just poor design. I contacted Kodak and they told me to just buy the $10.00 disposable batteries. If you know digital cameras you know how quickly they go bad."
1,Not compatable with the DX6490!!!!,"contrary to what the product description says, this charger kit is NOT compatable with all of the 6000 series DX/CX cameras. Do a search on Kodak's web-site if you need proof!! Hopefully the link to the Kodak page will show up below:http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-locale=en_US&pq-path;=272"
4,Kodak Ni-MH Battery Charger Kit,Product arrived on time. Like the case; holds everything and then some. Had to drain & re-charge the included batteries several times before charge time was close to what was written in the manual. Hopefully the batteries are ok. Have to wait and see.
5,Great Value,"Kodak no longer manufactures KAA2HR batteries as per Kodak on 1-1-2010, if you buy the off brand batteries they will not charge in the camera cradle or in the camera. Since you are getting 2 sets of batteries in this package this is worth the price alone. Two sets of Kodak batteries, if you can find them, now cost more than this package, so think of the charger and case as a free gift. Buy your rechargeable KAA2HR batteries now because they are becoming hard to find."
1,Terrible product,"If I could give ZERO stars, I would. I read other reports about the battery charger not working and stupidly didn't believe what I read. I too, purchased TWO rapid charges, and neither of them work! I thought it was the battery pack so now I have 4 of those, but the chargers simply DO NOT WORK. This is like the TWO Kodak Easy Share Printer Docks I purchased. Neither of them work either, but they will at least charge the camera batteries. What an expensive way to charge a battery! Needless to say, I will never buy another Kodak product again."
4,After the dancing days is a fantastic book!,It really captured the feeling of those who suffered. I couldn't stop reading! I even took it into the doctor's office with me!!
3,After The Dancing Days,"Thirteen-year-old Annie is going to the train station to meet her dad, who was a doctor in World War I, for the first time since the war ended. After seeing men who were injured come off the train with badly wounded bodies, legs and arms missing; Annie told herself she was never going to visit a hospital unless she absolutely needed to. After hearing her dad talk about the men in the hospital where he was working in their small Kansas town, Annie slowly became interested in the lives of the men her dad was taking care of. She became so interested that she started visiting the hospital. There she met Andrew who's face was badly burned. She became attached to Andrew as a good friend. There at the hospital Annie found out from Andrew about her uncle's mysterious death at battle. The book became tragic when a family member of Annie's had a heart attack."
2,After The Dancing Days,My book is about a girl named Annie who grew up during world War I.Annie is going to pick her father up where she sees wounded soldiers. When they get home her father tells them that he still wants to work at the hospital. Annie goes and visits the hospital and meets a young boy names Andrew. As they start to grow closer they open more about themselves and they learn more about the war and how Annie's uncle died.I think this book is for a 11 to 13 years old. I did not like this book because the climax was not exciting.
3,A very loving and touching book; could be a bit better!,"Rostkowski combines heroism, war, and love in this chapter book for children. The story is almost always set in a hospital, where Annie Metcalf, the main character, learns to confront Andrew, a bitter young veteran whos face yielded terror in many people. Annie soon opens her heart to this man, and yet must face her mother, who shows immense prejudice to Andrew. This book was repetitious, though. There was actually no real ""movement"" of the plot"
3,"A book that represents individualty,",This book captured the essence of what life was like for a teenager living in times of The Great War(World War 1). It explains the struggles of one man that was effected by the War. (He was poisoned with mustard gas.) The book is historically accurate because there are connections to other books in the time period.
2,"This book was badly written, does not appeal to teens.","This book was not only very badly written but it was so confusing that it was dificult to follow, comprehened, or enjoy. The flash backs were useless, not in a timely place, and no cross reference to the right place of the story. I am sure you are a great teacher but, you may get a better perspective or better ideas on what to write, for teens, if you interface or request teens/students opinions on your ideas. These comments were written by a female teen 14 years of age. END"
3,Not New York Sounding enough for me....Lyrics tights but...the album is ok overall...,"I say ok because the lyrics are amazingly tight, however the beats are not what I expected from a NY emcee. I have never been a big Dipolmat fan, but since I enjoy Hell Rell's music I thought I would venture out a little more and try out someone else besides Hell Rell. Lyrically Hell Rell is the best emcee the Dipolmats have to offer. JR is second in my opinion. After reading the reviews here I thought maybe I will try out some of JR'stuff. As a southerner myself and a fan of New York Hip Hop, I can't stand it when an artist from NYC attempts to sound like an artist from the south. It just does not work. Stay true to that New York sound... Clearly JR can rap over any beat which is good, it just seems like they over did it with the poppy high snares and hi hats on this one."
5,"Guide of the Perplexed""","I am Jewish.It introduced me to Maimonides but I had to buy the complete,2 volume work from Chicago press.A good condensation.An important thinker weho appeared at an interesting time in world history"
2,Monstah,Not worth it the annotated if you like to read a lot of gaps.It does touch upon alot but for the same price get the whole book.
3,"No editing, please","Maimonides is one of those authors whose works should not be edited. The whole thing or nothing.Guide is not simply a collection of Rabbinic opinions from the time of AKIBA more or less. M-Torah is much more of that sort than Guide.There is a line from Akiba through Maimonides to Spinoza to the age of modern science. M-Torah can be read without belief that Maimonides held to a single metaphysical word. No so Guide.The fact that Nachmonides cites Guide in refuting the eternality of the universe indicates the teachings of Nachmonides and aaan iol-consssidered position by Maimonides, not that he accepted Prophets over Aristotle, but that he offeres as ""evidence"" that Aristotle's version requires no supernaaturalism. I must think that Maimonides must have been in dispair over the absurdity of his argument."
1,Waste of money,"This whole series of books is garbage. The information in the books is copied verbatim from health sites anyone can get for FREE on the internet. If you think it is bad when college students cut and paste information into their term papers, what do you think of cutting and pasting an entire book from the internet and then charging people a lot of money for it? I think it is a scam and the M.D. and Ph.D. who put their names on the cover should have their degrees revoked.Don't waste your money on these books. You would be much better off going to a reliable health portal on the internet."
5,OMAR IS GOD !!!,This is by far the BEST of the HCFTHS series. I have listened to this at least once a week for the last 13 or so years... It is mind numbing and beyond description...It is a MUST HAVE for any HARDCORE junkie !
4,Works well with electric trimmer,"I was pleasantly surprised how well this thing works with my electric Ryobi trimmer. Dug well and didn't bog down even on high speed in some very hard soil that hadn't been tilled before. It's still tiring work holding the thing back (the tines all spin one direction, so it wants to pull forward) and pushing down to get it to really dig into hard soil, but it works well. I actually own the Ryobi version of this tiller attachment, but it seems like it's pretty much identical, and I just want others to know that you don't need a gas trimmer to use it. I'd recommend it."
1,Great for 15 minutes,"This product worked wonderfully for the 15 minutes that it worked. I bought several different troy-bilt attachments for my string trimmer, and all of them except the string trimmer itself have failed. This product, like all of the troy-bilt attachments, seems to have a collar swaged onto the drive shaft that is probably intended to prevent damage to the motor head if you hit a rock. The problem is that instead of giving way only under imminent damage, vibration allows it to move and causes the drive shaft to lose contact with the motor head."
4,Troy vs. Ryobi,Good hard working add-on. The Troy is compatible with Ryobi extension. Easily connected and disconnected.
4,What a scream!,"This is a fascinating look into the life of a cult character. Maila Nurmi was quite an independent woman for the 1950's, and she speaks very candidly of her past, of her treatment by those in charge of productions, of her personal life, and of what it took to become that haunting figure whose very strangeness was compelling. And that tiny, tiny waist: Vampira had always seemed so unreal to me, that it was a delight to meet her real alter ego!"
3,Hardly a movie!!!!!!,Misleading title!!It's like an extended DVD extra. Good interview but would have liked better directing!! And please who cast the interviewees?????Nice to see some rare footage of the show. Vampira herself id quite interesting to listen to!!
4,Bass Report,"This is a classic bass genre for those who have ears... It contains all of the standard bass routines and 'hits' that most bass cd's are required to have. It even contains a tweak session for tuning up both your tweeters and sub woofers. If you are interested in the deep bass experience that classic bass delivers, then buy the disc or mp3."
4,CAN YOU SAY BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have many other Bass Mekanik titles but just listen to track 15 and 7 and you will know what I mean. I love driving up to a red light and people wonder where is this bass comin from? If your like me purchase the album!!!!!!!
4,Very Fine Fiddling and Picking,"This CD is made up of 21 straight ahead fiddle tunes with an old Fiddling Doc Robert's show piece as title cut. These tunes are played expertly with spirit and spunk (not like museum relics) and are not tarnished by unneeded processing. It sounds real, like pickin' on the front porch, only better. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more fiddle tunes or anyone who likes to enjoy those old time fiddle melodies."
3,Decent for it's intended purpose,"I bought this for a multi cultural event at the college I work at and for indoor purposes, this is a good product. However, I would strongly recommend against using this outdoors, even in a covered area; I made that mistake with a few other flags and they were faded and largely destroyed within 18 months. Still, these sorts of flags were never rated for outdoor use so for the purpose intended, they are fine."
3,Very light weight but nice,"This isn't exactly what I thought I was getting, but it will serve our purpose fine for an indoor wall hanging. It's a very lightweight nylon fabric, which will be ideal for indoor use, but not sure how it would hold up outside though."
3,Trimmer Attachment,"This thing does beat scissors. It is a bit heavy, but that isn't an issue because you finish youre work a lot quicker.The shipping DID get under my skin. You see, I live abroad, so I have my packages sent to a shipping company in miami that ships them overseas. The package arrived at that address, but it was missing my name and ID number. When I finally got an answer from the seller I was given the wrong tracking number.In the end I can say the product is great but the shipping deptartment dropped the ball and customer service soon followed.Would have been 5 stars otherwise..."
2,Too Heavy!,"PRO's:- Works well, cuts effortlessly- Attaches to string trimmers with an EZ-Connect connector- Head swivels to trim tops of bushes above your reachCON's:- Insanely HEAVY!- Does not come with an extension armI am actually returning mine because it is too heavy to use effectively. Construction uses thick metals which while improving ruggedness, makes it too heavy to be agile.I have a long fence line of tall shrubs that require a long trimmer. I extended my hedge trimmer by coupling it with the extension arm from the chainsaw attachment, giving it an extra 3 feet of reach.Unfortunately, I was not able to finish trimming my shrubs because I got too tired.I would like it much more if it were made of lighter materials."
4,Troy-bilt trimmer,The trimmer works great. Everything is as stated in the discription except- The product is not Troy-bilt. it is a standard MDE built over the counter Fit all product. other than that it works well.
1,Poor Quality,"I recently purchased this hedge trimmer because I liked the idea of just purchasing an attachment instead of a stand alone hedge trimmer. The first time that I used it, it worked ok for about 10 minutes and then I noticed that it seemed to be losing its cutting power. On its second use, it would barely cut anything. The blades seem to be working but they feel like they slip when cutting (or trying to cut). I have now resorted to trimming new growth on my hedges with the weed eater attachment. I have been very pleased with the other attachments for this unit but would advise anyone looking for a hedge trimmer to save their money and purchase something else."
3,"good idea, but bad technology","it is a very good idea to use disc instead of the expensive compactflash card. It may be a great product 2 years ago. but now: 1. 40M is too small for new compactflash card 2. no USB support, that is, slow slow downloading. 3. its price is too high."
3,Heart Warming Tale of a NiNo who lived so much so young,Overall the book was specific and breathtaking. However I must say I did not enjoy reading Enrique's father biography in the first chapter. Perhaps the next book could be specific and mention the same on the cover. I felt it should have giving alot more attention to Enrique's(specivically in the first chapter)life as an artist and less of his personnal life. But any information or insight his fans get will make them appreciate more his incredible talent as a singer. Afterall it is inherited. (-*: Look forward to the official biography-----and more pictures please
2,Good music sunk by poor sound quality,"The music is good and Sarli is excellent for those just starting out in Tango. The problem here is it sounds muddy as if recorded in a large cavern on AM quality equipment. I will probably search for my favorite tracks on other releases. If you are looking for something just to listen to, look elsewhere."
3,A let down finale to a great series.,"Even though I enjoyed the final episodes of Vampire Princess Miyu I still sadly felt letdown in the end, the big twist in who the strongest Shinma is didn't really go down well with Me nor did the explenation on how it all came to be and I was left wanting more which is annoying since to My knowladge there isn't any more or as far as I know there is never gonna be another series, in the end it all felt rushed to Me.Worth it to complete Your collection and watching once or twice."
5,WOW! What a book!,"Want to read a story that you wont put down until you're done? This was one of the best books I have read in a while. It has a GO,GO,GO theme to it, barely time to catch your breath between chapters. I liked this one so much I jumped on to Amazon and bought all the others I could find by Matthew Reilly. Definently made it onto my favorite authors list with this book.It is years later now, but I still say this was one of the best , fast paced reads out there. The scarecrow series is baddasscool!"
4,Very entertaining,"While the book may be very unbelievable, it is highly entertaining. Ofcourse, there are a few small mistakes when it came to Mr. Reilly's research, but those are forgivable. The action moves at an incredible pace while still maintaining a sense of originality. This is definatly one of the most action-packed novels I've read in many years."
1,Need to Respond,"I am responding to the Marine Biologist who wrote a review about this book. Thanks for spoiling the story!!!! I haven't even read the book and already know the demise of some of the characters, no thanks to you!!!! Some of us know a little bit about killer whales and military operations/forces. It's a a fiction book to read and enjoy. I am sorry that you didn't. I read the reviews written by other readers to find out a little bit more about the book. I still read the books and form my own opinion."
1,JUST LEFT ME ICE COLD,"This is, without doubt, the worst book I have ever read. It has no redeedming features whatsoever, lacks any credibility, tempo and - the worst fault: no sense of adventure.That's because the character of 'scarecrow' is so super-human that we already know, before the end of chapter one, that he will live the longest, unscathed, to save the world.C'mon Matthew. You are an afficionado of the action genre...so at least pack some real punch into it by twisting the story violently and unexpectedly. Or, erh, anything to make it less than a watching-paint-dry experience.May I suggest you check out the excellent Mark Bowden 'Black Hawk Down' to take tips on writing a real bone-crunching fire fight.One star only...generous,because they didn't have Nil stars!"
2,Should Have Been an Action Movie,"The short and sweet version:Picture every cheesy action movie you've ever loved (and I can admit to getting my kicks out of the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon flicks out there) and then type them out into a novel. They ALL seem a bit silly, no matter how much you enjoy them. This book would be no exception to that rule.This book as a movie; hmmm...maybe...depends on who plays who..As a book; definitely NO."
4,Ice Station,"Kept me turning pages, literally stayed awake at night to read more. A few unexpected turns in the plot other than a simple rescue. Will read more of his books."
5,Unputdownable,What an absolutely fantastic read. Took all of two days to finish and almost made me miss my train station both mornings I was reading it. Already bought the next two and thanked the friend who recommended it. If you like the Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler books this is a great option.
3,Anarctic intrigue,"Mayhem has occurred at the Wilkes Ice Station, a U.S. research facility located in the inhospitable icy wasteland of Antarctica. Eight scientists while diving beneath the ice shelf detected an apparent alien spacecraft in the deep recesses of an underwater cavern. While in communication topside with the station the team was attacked by an unknown entity and all were killed."
1,Run away as fast as you can!,"Good for a comic book or one of those senseless summer blockbuster action movies. But for a book this was pretty bad. If you want action and adventure try James Rollins, he writes along the same lines, but much better, mind you."
3,if you switch off some brain cell....,"Reading this book you can see that the author is talented but he needs for sure a scientific adviser.In this book are too many technical absurdities;you can't identify yourself in the tale reading about the ridicolous 'maghook' (magnetic hook),about a liquid nitrogen charge that can freez a pool of water in spite of thermal exchange laws,about a 2 gigawatt plutonium reactor on a plane(! ) and about many others plesantries. If you compare this book to 'reference authors' yuo see that Chrichton is imaginative but very careful when he writes about science and he prefers 'human' characters.Instead Clive Cussler has a superman-style hero like Dirk Pitt.In 'Ice Station' a superman hero and such extreme science creatins are frankly too much. Maybe the author is in a hurry to write a script for a major motion picture an not a real good book.Neverthless if you switch off many brain cells the book will be really enjoyable.(my e-mail is tanocci@yahoo.com)"
1,astonishingly bad,"The author apparently wrote this armed with nothing but a library of bad 80's action movies, a hero worship of special forces types and a coffee table book on modern weapons. Ice Station exists in a world in which CFC's are highly explosive, unmodified MP5's fire reliably underwater, radiation mutates sea creatures into monsters and TOW missiles can't hit hovercrafts. And this guy *really* doesn't like the perfidious 'beady-eyed' French. That this guy has been successful goes to show it's impossible to underestimate your readership."
1,Reilly's Spoof,"I was on the floor laughing by the time I finished this comic book. Reilly has done an outstanding job of spoofing all the Die Hard, Ah-nold, 007, Indiana Jones movies all in one book. His hero Schofield survives bullets, knives, killer whales, falls off 300 foot cliffs, mutant seven ton seals and a nuclear blast. As a techno-thriller genre it deserves zero stars, but as a spoof it gets five. This will make a great movie. Stick to screen plays, Reilly--novels aren't your talent."
4,entertainment that is fast paced and escapist,"I enjoyed reading Ice Station. It took me out of the world I live in and into another one. That's the style of book I like: escapism with a capital E. Half the fun was trying to work out the devices that were real and the ones that were invented by Matt Reilly. There was only one problem. At night, I would finish a chapter but then I couldn't go to sleep because I had to read more. It was just non-stop action. Some parts are over the top but that's fine by me because I am a fan of James Bond movies. If you like Bond movies, you'll like Reilly's style. Enjoy the book: it is escapist, entertaining, informative and FUN!"
4,Ice Station,"If you want action, this is the one for you. The pace is very fast and never lets up. There are some inaccurate portions to it as far as injuries are concerned; but not a problem as far as an adrenaline rush. I just wish that more of his work was available in the US."
5,A book for entertainment's sake.,"Many people have written similar reviews about how 'the characters have no depth, the storyline is nowhere near original and half the stuff just wouldn't happen."" Well, when what you're thinking at the end of the prologue is 'What's going to happen now?' and your thoughts at the end of the first chapret are 'I wish I hadn't asked!' how can there be time for a lengthy, dusruptive explanation about a characters background when it dosent play a part? When it comes to escapism, Matthew Reilly is a master, and when it comes to his characters and plot -- after all it IS 'popular FICTION'"
4,One of the best action packed techno thrillers.,"This book will keep you entertained from start to finish. A Clive Cussler, W.E.B.Griffin and Tom Clancy, Australian style all rolled into one. What is more exciting is that at 24 years of age, we can hope to have a lot more books from this author."
4,Ice Station,"I read this novel when I was on vacation last year, and thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was; an all action thriller. The action comes at tremendous clips, and the story rarely slows down to a speed under that of the Concord. My one negative comment I have to give is that you have to take a vacation, not only from home, but from reality as well. Some of the scenes leave you saying to yourself...come on now, exciting, but rediculous. I enjoy an action thriller as well as any other reader, but I would like to not have to leave my brain on vacation while I'm reading the book. I gave the story four stars because of it's terrific pace. Rarely have I read a book that was actually so much fun. I just wish the author would stay a little more credible, so that the reader wouldn't have to suspend reality to enjoy the book."
5,Unputdownable! A roller coaster ride,"I really enjoyed this. I treated this as, and had as much fun as, a death-defying rollercoaster ride or an Indiana Jones movie. The story might have issues but hey who cares (this is not written as an intensely-researched Tom Clancy book, and who cares about the accuracy of the physics in Batman or The Peacemaker or Predator or P J O'Rourke...).I couldn't put it down, which amused and almost annoyed me. I read in two long sittings, chuckling in pleasure at each new thrill the author had put into the yarn. Again, it was a totally different experience to Le Carre or Graham Greene but a great amusement.I've also read his ""Temple"" (think Temple of Doom with loop-de-loop and corkscrew) and ""Contest"" (like being in a pinball machine with action whizzing around). They're confections and lot of fun. Don't let anyone tell you different."
4,For James Bond/Dirk Pitt fans only.,"If you're a fan of James Bond and Dirk Pitt, you'll really like this book. The hero is sort of an amalgam of Bond and Pitt and Indiana Jones and several others. And he survives more ""certain death"" situations in one book that all the rest combined. Yes, some of it (ok, a lot of it) is totally illogical. But if you can suspend about 95% of your disbelief, it's quite a fun read.Those readers looking for a well-researched techno-thriller based on fact should pass on this one. They'll just be annoyed by all the impossible escapes and situations.So, if it's so illogical and unreal, why did I give it four stars?? Because I read it when I was home with a miserable flu. And for a few hours, this book made me completely forget about how bad I felt. Any book that can do that deserves four stars."
3,Mostly fun,"Not great, but it does entertain. Approach it the way you would a James Bond movie - it'll be noisy and crammed with improbable but exciting action.That was my main complaint - TOO MUCH action. The author certainly has an imagination for dreaming up all these wild sequences, but he piles it on without end. Complication after complication, I was starting to skip that stuff to find the story again.If he could've kept the same spellbinding approach to action, but throttled down on the amount of it, this would've been a lot better.Still, I got a kick out of it. But I do agree with an earlier review below this one - I've never heard of killer whales attacking people the way they do in this book. If the author made that up (having whales act like sharks), it's a nasty mistake."
3,"Good in parts, reads like movie outline","Ice Station is fast-mvoing but I got the feeling that it was converted from a film script. Every time the story slowed down, some new element was thrown in. Sometimes this worked, sometimes it didn't and I didn't think much of what the object under the ice turned out to be -- too comic strip. It didn't have the same sort of realism that Clancy's books do, particularly with the military. But it's a quick read that will keep you entertained, esp. if you like blockbuster movies without much beyond the action."
1,Absurd!!!,"This book is jam packed with the most absurd action situations imaginable. The author must have spend hours thinking them up and even more time convincing himself that they are plausible.The action sequences are the makings of a cheesy Van Damne movie. Yes, lets drag him out of has been hell!If you are intelligent enough to actually read English you should spend your time reading anything but this book. Wait for it to come out in the theaters for some mindless entertainment.PS. I have no idea if this book is being made into a movie. If it is I'll wait for the 25th anniversary directors cut platinum edition on DVD. I should hope to dead by the time this happens."
4,CAPTAIN MARVEL TAKES THE ANTARCTIC!,"This was a fun book; just as if I were reading my favorite comic book. The author is a very good-natured gee-whiz type of guy. Lots of italics and lots of !!!! The pace is fast, furious and highly readable. Many reviewers commented on its ""movie-like"" qualities. I have a qualifier; the movie should be animated with Bruce Willis doing the voice of the intrepid, industructable hero. I recommend Ice Station, you'll have a good time!"
5,"Good, Dumb Fun","There are some novels you read just because they're a roller-coaster ride, pure fun, and this is one of them. Sure, it doesn't have anything in it I haven't seen before, and to call the characters one-dimensional is to credit them with one more dimension than they actually have, but... I didn't care. It's a thrill ride, a popcorn movie in your head, a good old-fashioned adventure in the pulp tradition. You might sit back and say ""Aw, c'mon,"" but you WILL be entertained. Maybe someday Matthew Reilly will being writing more polished, sophisticated Lit'rachoor, but this is a good, fun start."
4,Damn fine!,"This book is an excellent read, fast paced and exciting, there are however plot holes as you would expect to find in any book, but beware it is very Hollywood! Why you would find a child on an Antartic Science station is beyond me and then for that said child to be a whizz kid is also another bone that sticks in the throat, get past the minor flaws and this is well worth a read."
