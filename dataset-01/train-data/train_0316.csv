4,Surprised and pleased,"I don't usually go in for historical fiction and I was pleasantly surprised at this one: informative but never boring, something of a page-turner. Well-written; not the overdone stuff hist fict sometimes turns out to be. Really gives a flavor of life at the time. I already ordered the sequel."
5,Another winner,"Cornwell's historical novels are always fun and this one hits the mark spot on. True there is something vaguely familiar about this - it does seem to be alot like the Warlord series but who cares. That was a great trilogy and this one promises to be equally enthralling. Well done, Mr. Cornwell. I'll look forward to the next book in the series!"
5,entertaining read,I enjoyed this book. I am a Cornwell fan. Kept my attention and interest. Interesting historical period too. Will look for the sequels.
3,The Last Kingdom,"Having read other books by this author, I was pleased to find this one among books offered for my kindle. This author writes on historical subjects with interesting characters. I will definitely purchase more of his books."
5,Wonderful historical fiction,There is are reasons why Bernard Cornwell has been one of the most appreciated historical fiction novelists and this book is most definitely one of them. To tackle this dark episode in history is brave and amazing as nothing is really known about this period in time. B.C. makes the best of it!
5,Could not put the book down,"I cannot wait ot pick up the other books in this series. Well written, fast paced and you learn some history in the process. Not for the faint of heart - well described violence."
4,"Historically interesting, but very violent","This book seems well researched. It gives an interesting picture of a historical period that most of us know nothing about. I found the book too violent to really enjoy it. It seems to me, that the protaganist should have been more traumatized by some of the horific events depicted. On the other hand, the portrayal of the Norse religion was interesting. The view of Christianity from the outside was well done.I found this book worth reading, but would not read it again, or any sequel to it."
3,Boring,"My main criticism of this book is that it is boring. It reads like a book which the author wrote having dug out his old Master's thesis from college and then turned into fiction by having history narrated rather than described.The characters come across as cartoonish almost, stilted, stereotypical barbaric Norse and stupid blind Christian. Surely every Norseman wasn't a noble savage and every monk and king spineless idiots? Battle after battle, one violent scene after another. Ho hum. It kept putting me to sleep."
4,The Last Kingdom viewpoint,Well written. Gets bogged down at times in the details. Overall a good story line.
1,Poor Excuse for a History book,"FIRST, I really like Mr. cornwell's earlier books, but I found this book to be boring, the main character is suppose be 11 years old, but is expressing the wisdom of someone much older. I also grew tired of reading the unpronounceable names of people and towns. I believe Mr. Cornwell needs to return to the type books that made him famous such as the Sharpe novels, the Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles, etc. It appears that Mr. Cornwell has become rich, well known and is now trying to find his ""roots"" in writing fictional British history books"
5,Superb documentary of Major Marine Disaster in US,"Outstanding documentary of the events leading up to the disaster of the Great Lakes steamer in 1915. Author provides solid documentation tying the loss the Titanic three years previous and the consequences it had on regulations of lifeboats and rafts. Great explanation in layman's terms on shipboard stability. Good illustrations throughout the book. Organization of story chronologically superb. I got this book off the library shelf becuase my grandmother was a survivor of the Eastland disaster. Hilton has, after 80 years, told the story correctly erasing myths concerning the actual reasons leading up to the disaster. Great detail concerning the lives of the people involved."
3,not about the titanic,"This book is not about the Titanic, but about the S.S. Eastland. This ship, due to the Titanic, required her to have more life boats causing her to be top heavy. The book is about the history of the ship and the sinking."
4,Collaborative Divorce,"This book has a nice compilation of advice for those who are attempting a collaborative divorce. This book discusses both uncontested and contested divorces. I especially liked page 8 which has a simplified chart of the situation you are in and what chapter in the book you should start on.I agree with other reviewers that this book is not exhaustive of the legal information needed for any divorce, but it's a helpful addition. Make sure to visit your state's government web site for information on the specific laws in your state."
5,I hope I never use this,"I hope to never use this. I just happen to like Nolo's offerings. It's very useful if things aren't working out and you and your partner can split up amicably.Sadly I know way too many people going down this road.As with all Nolo products, treat them as references. You should always seek professional help."
3,Anyone contemplating divorce should read this book...,At the conclusion of your divorce do you want to take a nice vacation or send your lawyers on one? Every dollar spent bickering in court over who gets what is a dollar wasted. This book provides a nice easy to read framework for working out a settlement out of court collaboratively. Follow this and save literally thousands of dollars in attorney fees.
3,Not what I expected,"Not what I expected. It takes you through the steps of mediation and collaborative divorce with checklists and advice, which is what the title implies, but it only gives lip service to a true do-it-yourself divorce. While this is mentioned in the table of contents, it actually gives you no help or advice on what to do when only the simplest of actions are needed."
3,Disturbing Book,"I just read Warrior's Song. It was not as great as her other books. Yes, it kept you wanting to know what happened next but, there were too many events happening. Catherine Coulter rewrote this book and changed the title. She said that this is better than the original story. I don't think it is. Also, there is a disturbing rape scene in the first few chapters. This gives you a bad feeling about the book already."
3,Not one of her best efforts,"Since I am a coulter fan and have read a number of her books I was a little disappointed by this one. I became bored by the thick headed Chandra. I mean how many ways does he have to tell her that she needs to behave like a woman should, for the times.she isn't stupid, she appears that she is a spoiled child that will have her way no matter what or who she hurts in the process. Going to the holy land for her to really grasp what war really was, just proves how stupid and inmature she is."
1,Boring...disturbing...overall lackluster product by coulter,"Usually I am a fan of this author, but not this time. Warrior's song just fell flat after the first four or five chapters. Inane plot, characters, dialogue, etc. Jerval is just allright and Chandra leaves much to be desired with her obstinancy. Enough is enough. Yes, the rape scene was completely unnecessary; it had nothing really to do with the overall point of the story, so why put it in there? Just for the sake of writing about rape? Disturbing. Can't believe even a few of these reviewers gushed about such vapid content. BLECH."
1,i agree with everyone else,"I agree with the other reviews. She writes a rape sence and then decides that that person will be a good hero in another book??? I have to admit I'm courious to know how she pulled that off in the other book "" Oh, btw my sweet, I fathered a child by another women who's now married to someone else because I had kinda of brutally raped her in front of people...but I would never to that to you, Oh no its only a one time thing!""cant really blame it one how women were treated then ethier I mean her books are not that researched. The Muslim women in the book was amazing too, i just rolled my eyes at that!I hated this book."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF S@#$,"I don't know what kind of sickos like to read novels with RAPE in them, but I am NOT one of them. One character gets raped within the first chapter. The mother is a vicious pit viper who tries to then marry off her daughter to the rapist.Jerval APPEARS to like the fact that Chandra is a warrior-woman, but the mili-second that they are married, he tries to change every aspect of her and squash her warrior nature. She is forbidden to fight or wear her own warrior clothes...He tries to turn a warrior-woman into a medieval Martha Stewart. And he tries to con her into doing these things by controlling her with sex. sadist.He even locks her in their room and tries to bring her to heel by spanking her. Not kinky sex spanking either, humilating punishment for a small child spanking.This book is a disgusting load @#$% that any strong confident woman would be offended by.I was offended that COULTER would dare insult her fellow women by churning out #$%^ like this!"
1,very dissappointing,"Not worth reading.The rape at the begining was a tasteless scene I could have done with out in my mind..Rape is such a deplorable problem in our society that to put into a book I want to read for enjoyment, had me putting it down with a bad picure in my head. I read for the enjoyment of good verses evil with of course good wining.These characters were sadly lacking to become better than they were at the begining of the book."
1,I Was Appalled by this Sickening Story,"It disturbs me that this author can so casually write a rape scene; she leaves the impression that rape is no big deal. I think she is a disgustingly disturbed person. She obviously condones rape because she gave this idiot his own story!Also, pay close attention to the mothers' in her stories. Nearly every mother in every novel is a shrew. Hmm....I like a novel with class, not deliberate depravity. What a disgrace."
4,A Very Good Book,"I was not surprised when I found myself really enjoying this book. There has never been a book by Catherine Coulter that I have not liked, she's such a skilled writer, and her stories are so fun to read. Warrior's Song is a very fun book to read, it's defenantly a page turner. I did not really like Chandra because of how she treated Jerval in the begining of their marriage. I really liked Graelam de Moreton even though he was such a bad boy. Overall the book was really good and it is worth reading it."
1,"Trite. I expected much, much more.","I bought this book on the advice of a good friend--a friend whose recommendations have been uniformly spot-on; until now.I found the book trite, pat and predictable. It felt like Mr. O'Connor wanted to show off his past companies' successes while also proving to the reader that he was just a ""normal"" guy--that if he [O'Connor] can do it, anyone can.I hope folks reading this review realize that there is no ""secret recipe"" for business success. I wonder how many people who have read The Map of Innovation have subsequently achieved significant business success; my guess is: zero.In any case, to my friend's dismay, I couldn't even finish the book. I hope my experience with it helps others to avoid wasting their time on it. I wish I could recommend another book in its stead, but I'm afraid I'm not very familiar with this genre in general."
5,Not one problem...,"I take this unit EVERYWHERE with me as my laptop is a power hog and trans-atlantic flights usually are much longer than my laptop battery will hold out. I have never had it kick out on me like the other reviewer had.....Overall it is a wonderful product...compact, easy to use, and versatile. It provides 75 watts of output power, so as long as your laptop draws no more than 75 watts (which the vast majority dont) you will be all set. Easily 5 out of 5."
2,"Very limited focus, not a generally applicable book","After looking at this book, I would have to say it would only be useful to novice users in a Windows world. The included software is almost entirely Windows-centric.It barely mentions the Macintosh platform very little, which I find odd since the Macintosh is generally regarded as the best CD-R mastering platform. If you're in the right niche audience, the book could prove useful. Otherwise, give it a miss."
3,"Who is ""Luna Muse""?","This ""Luna Muse"" person is writing ""reviews"" of Mobile Fidelity CD-Rs all over the 'net; this is the third one I've found--and I merely did a web search on ""Mobile Fidelity"", not a search on ""Luna Muse"".The ""reviews"" always consist of the same, regurgitated ad copy written by Mobile Fidelity.Wonder who Luna Muse works for?Guess."
4,alternative science,Also showed this to my 7th grade science class. they spent some time giggling and chuckling. very educational. thanks you very much
3,I wish there was more!,This is a great DVD for any age. Beakman makes learning fun. I wish the earlier episodes were included. Like the one that explains where ear wax comes from . . .truly gross!!
2,"I liked it back in the day, but not today!","I remember watching this show as a kid on weekend mornings and loving it. I bought it to show in my science classroom. I am glad I previewed it before showing it to my students, because it is awful! There is no theme to it, it's just a bunch of grown adults acting foolish. It's not funny at all."
5,Wishing for more but this will suffice,"This brought back some good memories. It is a compilation of the best experiments and happens to include one of my favorites, the recycled paper though the panty hose experiment.I only wish they would release all the seasons as this DVD only scratches the surface of what a great show it was. Still, it is just enough to keep the show in your heart every time you feel nostalgic. If you are a fan of the show this is a must have. Even if you have never seen the show, it is great for the kids!"
5,So much fun!,Education and so much fun. My 8-year old loves this DVD. I wish I knew where we can watch this show. It is worth it every single penny we paid for it.
3,The Best of Beakman's World...,"This video came out in June 1994, after the second season was over; yet this video only has clips from the first season. It contains many different Beakman's Challenges and fast facts along with other clips. As a long (and big) Beakman fan, I don't consider most of this film to be the ""best of"". Don't get me wrong, the video is not bad, and many should thoroughly enjoy it, but don't let this ""best of"" make you think you're getting the gist of the show!This show has so much more and better experiments, facts, and challenges! Don't stop here! If I made the best of Beakman's World, it would be much different; even if it was just from the first season!"
3,Below Average Results,"Bought these, they come new with a really nice case but the actual earbuds don't give out very good sound quality. They don't even come with foam on the buds. Avoid this, try another brand. I have had good results with Motorolla brand."
3,Almost Wonderful...,"* * * Let me preface my opinion by saying that I own the regular deck of Power Thought Cards by Louise L. Hay, where the cards are two-sided. I flipped through these cards, and was dissappointed that there were no examples of the verses on the other side of the cards from the original deck. The drawings are more elaborate on these cards, but I feel the verses were better on the side not used. * * *The drawings on these cards are beautiful! And the fact that they are sticky on one side makes them all the more useful. I can finally put them places I will see them more, like my bathroom mirror, or on my front door. Louise Hay is a master of her field."
4,Tom Wilson has put me back in the cockpit.,"Tom Wilson's book takes me back to the sights, sounds and smells of Southeast Asia. He makes me feel the skin of an F-105 Thunderchief through my gloves and smell the familiar odor of the JP-4 fuel as I perform my pre-flight walk around inspection. I feel the drips of salty perspiration rolling down my face from under my helmet as I sit at the end of the runway waiting while the armorors pull the pins from my bombs. The tension builds. For those who haven't done it, this is the way to experience the daily life of those pilots who fought and died in the skies over North Vietnam. The ready comes home alive"
5,A great single with an excellent tune!,"I heard it on Dawson's Creek and loved it, I can get really funky with it! The up beat really gets me going."
1,Cheap and Shoddy,"This product is horrible. We bought two, one for our king bed and one for our daughter's twin bed, and they both ripped when we tried placing them over the mattresses. We were extrememly careful putting the cover on our bed since the one on our daughter's bed ripped the first time. Moreover, when we were zipping it around our king mattress the zipper just broke. It came off the track without provocation and rendered the cover worthless. Both covers are now repaired with duct tape and I am disgusted with the quality (or lack there of) of these products. These covers were not cheap and we bought them for the health and safety of our daughter. This company should be ashamed to sell products of such shoddy quality that are supposedly created for the safety of individuals with allergies. I will never purchase from this company again."
2,Poor quality,"What I can't understand is why they would cut so much out of the DVD set, when they repeat the credits after each major chapter. If they would have cut out all the repeat credits prehaps they could have included more of the story!!!! The last side is cut up so much that you don't even know how Beatriz found her mother - please someone please tell me. And what's up with Juventino killing Ignacio's father. And what the heck happen to Marycarmen? My goodness what knuckhead at TV Azteca authorized the release of this DVD in it's state."
4,Collins comes to the fore....,"Genesis really entered the radio arena with ABACAB. Phil Collins had just received critical acclaim for his solo album 'Face Value'. His influence is obvious on this album and Tony Banks takes a back seat for a change letting Phil loose with his love of rhythm and blues horns. The end result is different and refreshing. It certainly pulls Genesis out of the wet and windy 70's onto a radio platform eager to receive their new sound. The overall feel is rockier, with less multi-layered synth pads creating a wall of sound to a more percussive/jazzy affair. There are still songs in there that hark back to the old style and the way this mixes with the 'new' sound is quite exciting! It's Genesis, but not as we knew them!!"
4,Always There,"I got the cassette in an Xmas grab-bag in 1981 back when I was a dishwasher in NY. This is one of the few albums from my youth that I still want to listen to. ""Like It Or Not"", it's always there. Thank you for the gift. RR1071@isla.net"
4,A Pretty Good Genesis Album,"The ratio of good to bad on this album is better than any other post-Gabriel, making it my favorite. ""Who Dunnit?"" sounds like the band was intentionally *trying* to do a horrible song (and they succeed), and ""Another Record"" sounds like a good song trapped in a mediocre performance. The rest of the album ranges from pretty good (""No Reply at All"" is awfully poppy but not bad, ""Me & Sarah Jane"" takes a while to get me interested but it does) to very good. ""Keep It Dark"" (which took me some time to understand) and ""Like It or Not"" remain my favorite tracks. ""Dodo/Lurker"" doesn't bore me as much as Genesis' other late-period ""epic"" songs - I think because there are enough hooks to keep me entertained. Not essential by any means, but a pretty good listen."
4,Finding new ways to shine,"Could a band that lost two important members continues to amaze people with good music and great beats and melodies, well done arranges and a more pop approach from the 80's sound? If this one are Genesis, the answer is YES! This album is loaded of great tunes, like the awesome Abacab, and No Reply at All, in my opinion, the second very best one of the album. There's also the big ones that screams to the audience ""hey, we are still Genesis, like the outstanding Dodo/Lurker and Me And Sarah Jane, and the great one Like it Or Not, a short song, but remembering once again the prog period of the band. Man On The Corner is a more Phil's approach of his solo albums influences, but is also an excellent pop tune! Check it out!"
1,Bad cd.... very bad!!!!!!!!!,"This moron has enough nerve to call us poser fans when these posers Phil Collins fans weren't there were'nt there to support Genesis when ""Calling All Stations"" came out. They actually tried to go back to progressive rock with REAL DRUMS and new members. Do not listen to poser fans as they have no identities. They are just lost souls that only know the hits and Phil Collins. At least I am a progressive rock fan(Genesis is included here since they are a progressive rock band). Yes, King Crimson, and Steve Hackett are still playing, in full force, and enjoying fanfare, but where is the band formerly known as Genesis???? Thats right, broken up. Why? Because they went the wrong direction. They could have gotten new members they could have changed the name, but they didn't. Phil Collins is retiring, and Tony Banks quit rock all together. What does that say? Prog-rock lives on and so does the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway! Abacrap sucks!"
1,They are only in it for the money.,This record is absolute garbage. The sad thing is that it comes from a band who made such fantastic records as Trespass and Nursery Cryme.This is pop music of the lowest level.
5,highly recommended,i am amazed that i am the first person reviewing this great cd as till 3 days back there were a number of reviews posted for this album.anyway this is one of my personal favourites along with the lamb lies down on broadway.very highly recommended.five stars.
1,How about the real CD,"Some of us still play CDs. How about offering the remastered CD? CDs last longer than an MP3, plus we get the artwork and liner notes."
2,Great CD for 1 song,"I reached in to my cd case to play Abacab for the first time in many years and realized I don't have the CD... and my cassette is long gone. So in reviewing the track listing, I remember that there is only one song on the CD and that is the title track Abacab. Incredible song with long instrumental stretches.However, the remainder of this disc compels me to look for a used copy somewhere. Who Dunnit? Yuck. Phil Collins is tolerable as a solo artist, but he pretty much dominates this band by this time. His so called ""r&b"" infusion in to Genesis has no place. Leave the horn section to some light jazz band. Notice Collins has some irritating song on every one of his solo recordings?Find a used copy if you want this cd, too many weak songs."
2,Does not cut it,Abacab was the second album of the Genesis late period and it is horrible with the exception of the mostly instrumental title track and the psuedo reggae melody changing Dodo/Lurker. It is only on these songs that Genesis reaches back into their Prog Rock past and come up with strong material.
5,Love it,Great add to me CD collection.Love this album .Saw them on this tour and I was hooked .Hard to believe album is over 30 years old !
3,Begin the decline,"3 1/2Definitely the first disc from the former progressive titans that I did not fall head over heels in love with, despite it absolutely containing (perhaps lastly to do so) brilliant passages and some of their tightest pop songwriting to the date. There is just some pivotal glue missing from the entire release that anyone used to their work may notice, not to mention an encroaching fascination with electronic 80's frivolities."
2,Probably Their Weakest Album,"Even without Peter Gabriel, Trick of the Tail and Wind and Wuthering were rock solid. Even without Gabriel and Steve Hackett, And Then There Were Three and Duke had more than their share of redeeming moments. But with Abacab, the band finally hit bottom, although later albums would show the bottom was further still.Most of the songs here would have fit in on a Phil Collins solo album (""No Reply At All,"" ""Man On The Corner."") Only the title song and ""Dodo"" show any real contribution from the entire band. After the success of Collins' Face Value, it was inevitable that Banks and Rutherford would take a back seat to Collins, and that remained the case until Collins departure from the band."
2,SELL OUT,"Free from Peter Gabriel and now led by Phil Collins, Genesis suddenly decided to go for the big money in ABACAB. And they succeeded. The album went platinum. But the songs, they're just rubbish, pop, clean, texturized, syntesized pop songs with no heart. But, since the musicians in Genesis are all of them amazing professionals, they could make some of them work, even being totally devoid of heart."
1,EXPRESIONLESS GARBAGE ...,"SO bad, so bad ...GENESIS, once a greta progressive band, threw their principles to the wind and turned totally commercial. This kind of weak character divide monsters as AC/DC and Iron MAiden from things like GENESIS ..."
3,Valiant effort,"A newcomer to romance novels, Ms Vasquez Garcia hasn't met a cliche she doesn't like. A strong editor would have quicken the novel's sluggish pace. Character dialogue was mundane throughout. I hope her plays' dialogues are snappier. Otherwise, dull, dull dull."
4,Nice receiver,"This is a nice receiver. The remote & controls are easy to figure out. I wish the remote controlled more varied brand and models of other equipment, and I still haven't figured out how to crank down the rear speaker volume yet. Everything else has been great for a lower priced unit. My old Sony receiver fried and I needed a quick replacement. I hope to keep this one for a while, it seems to sound better than the Sony."
4,An Incredibly Disturbing Film,"This is Neil LaBute at his best. LaBute provides a train wreck that you can't turn away from. Aaron Eckhart (an actor LaBute uses often and well) delivers an incredible performance as one of the most despicable characters put to film. If you're not familiar with LaBute's work, this is a great place to begin. Then you should immediately check out Your Friends and Neighbors."
4,Malicious Evil Portrayed In A Frightening Fashion,"This fine movie is about human cruelty, malicious evil brought to life. There's a very pretty, funny woman who is attractive to every man she meets. ...I don't recommend watching In The Company Of Men with your wife or girlfriend. Females won't like this movie at all. A guy who has been stepped on a few times, however, and discarded like trash, will definitely feel a tiny, tiny bit of a connection with the horrible plot these two corporate low-life jerks concoct."
3,Not as good as his later works.,"I agree with a review that Roger Ebert gave Your Friends and Neighbors, which was, it was like Quinten Tarantino's Pulp Fiction to his Reservior Dogs. This film is a singular work, not on the scope of Your Friends and Neighbors, and not as good. Some scenes were very good and entertaining, and because of that, surely deserves to be watched. Hopefully if it goes on sale even more. At 20 dollars it would be a good buy. However, I did not find myself drawn into the failures of the characters as much as I was hoping for. So I find myself having to give it 3 stars."
4,Something different,"Normally, arthouse movies like this consists of style, tons of babble and VERY unlikable characters (I.E. ""HurlyBurly"", ""Basquait"", any Quentin Tarrantino movie, and my personal, sincere favorite ""HEAT""). What I like about them is that they are something new from what you would find from the average movie theater and what you get out of all that babble is a message (except with that godawful HurlyBurly). ""In a Company of Men"" was slow at the beginning, but give it time! I saw a sinister love triangle and felt a smidge guilty when I laughed at the sleaziest moments! Because of this, I call this an artsy, dark toned, less cartoonish version of ""Something About Mary""."
4,Great seeing in theaters....but owning it?,"This is a really enjoyable film the first time you watch it. It shocks you at the cruelty of it but you continue to watch. However, it's not a movie you'll likely watch over and over again in your free time. I use ""enjoyable"" insofar as if you like originality despite its offensiveness. No doubt, if you are female and especially disabled, will find this movie offensive. That does not detract from its inherent originality. That being said, multiple viewings diminish the impact of the movie and eventually render it impotent. It hits you at first, but afterwards you grow numb to its ""shock value."" Buy it if you plan on watching it every few years because otherwise, you'll grow quite tired of it, no matter how good it is."
5,In The Company Of Men,They say the sign of a great movie is if it makes you think about it the day after seeing it. You'll be thinking about this movie for a couple days.
2,Way overrated,"This film is an interesting study of how low people can sink and use and abuse an innocent person, but beyond that there is nothing about it that screams out ""THIS IS GREAT FILM ART!"" There is nothing about it that makes you want to watch it ever again. Technically dull, it will ultimately be forgotten just as Paul Schraider's early films such as ""Blue Collar"" and ""Hardcore"" have almost been completely forgotten."
1,Horrible DVD Quality,"This is a great movie, but the DVD transfer is the worst I've ever seen. It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy of an ancient videotape. The VHS version is sharp and crisp, but this DVD looks like you're watching the film under water. Moreover, the audio commentary is mindless and boring. Stay far away."
2,Read Straight Shaun's review,"I agree totally with straight Shaun.This movie is in no way funny. Ther are no lines nor sight gags to be seen. It is slow and often hard to understand as the sound quality is abysmal. This is as bad as it gets, and even a set up of multiple speakers did not rectify the fact that half the film is impossible to hear.Regarding the subject... well it is not flattering to males, but hardly wild stuff. I know people who behave like this, we all do. The key thing is to hope that they do not go through life punishing the present for the failures of the past.I felt sorry for the girl, but she was not strung along for particularly long, and should not fall in love at the drop of a hat. Key learning for all... be careful!"
1,"lazy thinking, lazy directing","Neil LaBute would have us believe he's dealing with serious issues in this film, or that there are insights into human relationships that only he can divine. If only that were the case. Instead, he's just a big softy who swings his Old Testament wrath in no purposeful direction. If LaBute gave his tired dramatic exercises a rest and put down his film camera he would simply tell us this: We should all aspire to be better people than the maggoty characters of ""In the Company of Men."" It's that simple, folks. And it's that boring. LaBute forgets, or chooses to ignore, the fact that people in the real world aren't this one-dimensional. He also forgets, or chooses to ignore, the fact that cruelty most often takes very subtle forms, and that evil acts are often committed by people with the best of intentions. Forget this dross. Life is too short for such a simple-minded moral lesson, even if LaBute has a certain talent for dressing it in such ugly, repulsive garb."
1,PAINFULL TO WATCH...,...because it's so bad. I would rather be handcuffed to the back of a Honda and driven over a cactus field than watch this contradicting and unimaginative trash again.
3,Like it because it's different,"WHY can't most Americans understand that the reason this film is better than average, is simply because it does not follow filmmaking by the numbers??It's NOT Hollywood. It dosn't want to be Hollywood. Remember Se7en?"
1,"Literally, the worst movie I have ever seen","And that says a lot because I generally find some redemming qualitys in any film. The only one I can think of for this waste of time is good acting. They all played their parts well with a lot of emotion. But coming out of it, I literally felt like I lost a good 2 hours of my life. I did not enjoy any aspect of the film. It was painfully slow, boring, depressing and it all seemed very 'fake'. For example, the office set was very drab and unintersting and just put me to sleep more. There was nothing intersting going on. And the ending? Talk about twisted! Thankfully, I did not rent this stinker, so I did not waste any money. Highly overrated."
5,a great movie for the jaded,"In the Company of Men is a wonderful movie that I watch at least twice a year. I first saw this movie at a University Film Festival. I was hooked. Not only does this movie reach me on an entertaining level but at the time it called up all sorts of feelings as myself and my buddies had been in a slump with the laddies. In fact, we made up a holliday called National I Hate Chicks Day. It is still celebrated every year, on March 13, all over the country where we all have landed. One of the festivaties that March 13 brings is a viweing of In The Company of Men."
1,Ick,"I can't believe this is listed as a comedy. I've witnessed more hilarious heart bypasses, and none of those cut as deeply."
1,"One of the stupidest movies, a waste of my time!","I could not watch more than 30 seconds of this awful, dull, offensive movie. I turned it off very quickly. This should not even be called a movie. It is poorly made (I can make better quality home movies than this), poorly written, poorly directed... It was not only disturbing to watch, but after the idiot made fun of a deaf person, that did it for me. It made me angry to know that there are such morons who would make stupid comments like this. This is how angry this movie made me, enough to warn others about the offensive jokes (if you can call them jokes since they aren't funny enough to be considered jokes).. In short, this movie has the worst of everything. The worst, most boring actors I had ever seen, poor direction, dull and not in the least funny at all! Don't waste your time!"
5,A really usefull guide.,"If you was ever intrigued by the multi-bladed folding knives, and wanted to know how to make your own, believe me - this is the book you need. I'm proud to have this book - since it showed me, exactly, how to design and construct all the little multi-bladed fascinating tools I ever wanted. If you want to make your folding knives too, buy this book and back to the bench! And good luck!"
2,ALL PLASTIC FEELS CHEAP,"I bought this bender because it has 4 sizes instead of 3. The pics of this bender are terrible, I assumed the part that you bend the pipe around was some kind of metal, nope the whole thing is plastic. It seems very flimsy. I did bend a brake pipe with it, and it did work. But I kept thinking it was going to break the whole time I was using it. So they wont refund the shipping and it seems I am stuck with the cheap piece of junk until it gets dropped and shatters. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY THROUGH AMAZON.SCAM"
5,comprehensive text for students of engineering,This book is excellent text for students in civil and mechanical engineering. This illustrations allied with your explanation is good for comprehensive of strengths of materials. It's very important new edition with computer application.
4,"""Gagamba"" the spiderman is one of his best",The novel pinpoints many insights that illuminate the subtle interplay of people in contemporary Manila.Simple and direct... the pages turn at the speed of light!
3,Wrong Place at the Wrong Time,"This book details how a number of people ended up at a posh Manila (Makati) restaraunt on the Sunday of an earthquake. Rich, poor, famous and powerful Pinoys stories are told chapter by chapter with reasons for each ending up at the wrong place at the wrong time.The strength of the book is the author's ability to make each character either one you hope avoids the collapse of the restaraunt or one you are glad is there. It is also an excellent reflection of current lifestyles in Metro Manila.The book at Mega-Mall is a bargain at P140, but I would recommend it at Amazon prices."
1,"ordered two, one broken","Yes it's cheap. That doesn't mean it's worth buying. I ordered two of these. One seems to work fine. The other only had one working earpiece. I had to send it back for a replacement (pain in the but), and I have to hope the replacement doesn't fail too. DAVE says ""be forewarned."""
1,They will not stay in place,"I go through headphones like water. They are forever breaking or getting lost so when I saw these I thought, why not? Well, they do not stay in place at all. They slide all over and are super annoying especially when you are trying to workout. I can't use the ear buds because they constantly fall out of my ears. On to the next for me."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this to use with one of my mp3 players as a backup set. Well just like my other pair of Coby headphones, the plug doesn't fit right and if you don't hold it just right only one side works. Cheap but Cheap!"
5,"Love it, will order one more future",You will get quality base and I like it. CVH42 cheap among other available ones and best fit for my purpose.
5,Perfection,These are a Very nice set! Don't let the price fool you! I have heard $100.00 plus ones that didn't sound any better! Superb! Comfortable! Sound like Live performance! Asolutely Amazing and Amazing Price! Ecellent with my Coby stereo and all my computers and any device that receives 3.5 mm plug- Sounds better than your average 40mm stereo!
4,Good Temporary Headphones,"For less that $5.00, including shipping, this beats buying the cheap earbuds that most airlines sell you. I use this when I don't want to take my expensive headphones on trips. It is also great for teenagers that constantly loss or break their headphones."
4,crazy phones for price,"i read the reviews and thought there was no way they could sound that good, i tried em out and was blew away by the way they sounded. for 4 bucks, what the hay, just add them to your cart with your next purchase and see for yourself. By the way these are perfect for running or any kind of exercise."
5,Great value and decent sound!,"I bought these headphones for the cost, not necessarily for the sound. They don't really have deep bass with my mp3 player, but they do with my CD player. I bought two sets."
4,It works,"I rated this item four stars for the fact that considering I paid only a couple of dollars for it, these headphones work pretty well. It is a bit flimsy and cheaply made, but I didn't expect anything less (or more) for the money I paid for it. It is comfortable on my head and the music sounds good, and I am very picky about my music. I would have liked a little more base but again, consider the price. If you're seriously expecting Bose quality and sound on this you're nuts! I have had mine for about a month now and I'm satisfied. I use them primarily on my Netbook."
4,Coby Headphones,"I was not really expecting much for the price, but, boy, was I pleasantly surprised. These are sturdily built and have good tone quality. A truly good deal."
4,good low cost headphones,"Cheap cheap cheap. Sound is decent. Bass is lacking. Foam ear covers are cheap. But can't beat the price. Got these for our young kids to use on road trips. They can beat them up and if I have to buy them again next year, fine."
1,Does not work at all,"If you buy these headphones do not expect them to, you know, make sound. When you plug them into your computer, the computer does not recognize them. The headphones are basically just model headphones because you cannot listen to music with them. If you want to simply look at the headphones, $2.99 is a good price. If you want to actually hear music coming from your device then this piece of plastic is not right for you."
5,HEADPHONES,These headphones are very sufficient. I love them. I am greatly satisfied with this purchase and may purchase again in the future.
3,cheapies,"I really didnt expect much from these headphones for only $3.00 but I just had to try them anyway.I dont like the way the sound pad hinges to the headband.they are fairly rugged and sound better than the sony MDR-110LP for $6.00.Also the coby cvh42 are not comfortable on my ears.I suggest for only $4.00 or so,check out the panasonic RP-HT21 headphones at amazon.AT this low price range I think the rp-ht21 are the best choice for great sound and a good cord thats very flexable and about 55 inches long.If anyone out there knows of any headphones that are better overall than these for under $10.00 please leave a comment."
5,Best for the price,"This headset is most certainly not the best out there in terms of quality. However, if you are just looking for a pair of earphones to listen to music, videos, etc. this does just fine. If you are an adult it should fit just fine. However, it swamped my two girls (3 and 5). The sound quality is just fine. For the price it can't be beat."
2,Don't buy!!!!!,The first time I got it there was no sound at all. Wasn't even worth it to return. Waste of money.
4,Love these headphones!,I don't use headphones a lot so I didn't want to spend a fortune on a pair. I found these and thought I'd give them a try. I tried them as soon as I got them. They're great. I love the sound quality. My only fault with these is that they only have a 4ft. cord. Now for me that's fine but for someone else the cord may not be long enough. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional DJ or anything so I don't know how they'd be for something like that but for everyday use I highly recommend them.
2,Sometimes Coby's okay. Not this one.,"At this price I bought two or three. When I gave one to the kid and a couple months later the headband adjustment tooth broke off, meaning it slops around your head at the largest adjustment. I told the kid I was disappointed, but gave him another pair. I used the third pair, and, stop me if you saw this coming... the headband adjustment tooth broke off.They'll go in the drawer in case I need a spare. Might look for some Koss headphones, but they might cost $7! :)"
2,Right earphone stopped working in 2months,Well you get what you pay for. Sound is ok as long as they are working but the right speaker went out in a couple of months
1,insulation cracks,insulation cracked in three places within the first month. Minuscule bare wire broke shortly thereafter. Crap. Bought Koss and Panasonic at the same time for comparison. The latter two are good cheap headphones.
2,Bad audio quality. but heck what do you expect for the price?!,I wasn't impressed by the audio quality. Found myself pressing these against my ears to get a little better sound. The cord is a bit flimsy one slight tug was all it took for these to not work anymore!
3,Sounds Great; Cord too Short,I was forced to buy an extender cord because this one was so short.The headphones have a nice sound for the price.
1,COBY headphones with short in one ear,"My COBY headphones arrived with a short in one ear,which really sucks because the sound is great,loud and clear thats why I always brought Coby headphones in the past but not anymore.I wont be buying COBY headphones anymore!"
1,Cannot believe it has lead content!,"I just couldn't believe it when my coworker pointed out that there is a fine print on the package states "" there might be lead content on the cord. Please wash hands after using."" Be real! We bought the headsets for our elementary school kids to use. Do you seriously think we can have something that has lead content around children or anyone????I think someone needs to remove this product off your shelves for good."
3,This was a gift purchase,"This was received very fast and was given to a relative. It seems to be working fine, so far. Thanks."
4,bought to modify,bought this product to modify them for a project i was working on pull them out of the package tested them worked fine pulled them apart pupped out the speaker tested them again before install and non functional the speaker cone wire is designed to break (molded in to plastic) so it will break if you dis assemble them...it was my fault so no fault of the product its self bought a different pair of speakers locally that finished my project....review note product worked fine till i tried to modify them through disassembly so i can not return them but for $3 and shipping on an impulse buy they work for the magnents and the speaker wires so thats a C+++
2,the phome ear muphs keep falling off,if you want something that will last please do not buy this item. the little earmuffs will rot. i had these for a month or 2 but the ear muffs rotted off.
1,"Piece of Crap, Please don't buy.","Many people (Like myself), see this product and think five bucks what a steal! I'm mad because I just threw away five bucks. It has horrible sound quality. The left speaker blew the same day i got it. Save the five bucks and buy a subway or get 10 more dollars and buy a Sennheiser lightweight or an audiotechnica lighweight."
3,Average headphones for an average price,Well i just received these in the mail. they got here as soon as possible which was nice!Im using them now and the frame is abit... average. takes a little force to adjust. the pads themselves have some rotation which is interesting.unless you are sitting a good 3-5 feet away from your computer the cord length is fine.as someone else mentioned you can hear the bass and that is something i can always appreciate but besides that the sound quality is normal.i would not use these on the move considering they will wear out alot faster that wayand the biggest thing to consider is the price. around 3 dollars with free shipping? ill take that.if you just need some decent cheap headphones by all means buy these otherwise increase your price range
5,wonderful,They work great best i have seen at this price fast shipping.. nice deep bass sound i could not find better for the pricethank you
3,Retrospective Packaging,"This is apparently part of a retrospective package of the seven albums up to ""Seventh Sojourn."" The back art of the CD case has the track listings over a ""MB"" logo instead of the album back, and any liner notes are replaced by segments of an interview with the band about the making of the album. Well, it's not like you need a lyrics sheet to follow a Moodies song, anyway. Just so you know it's not a direct replacement of your old record."
5,the best gets better,what more can a person say. I was 17 years old when I discoverd the Moody Blues.When I heard the first {Go Now} and then Insearch of the lost cord.It changed my whole life. The words and music.Where did these guyscome from. To bad Rolling Stone magazine and the rest of the music world don`t sit up and say more about the music of the Moody Blues.Don`t worry all you Moodys As long as we listen the words and music will come.Because we all are on a threshold of a dream.
2,"A fine album, but distressingly poor CD mastering.","Considering the prominent display of ""remastering"" hoopla on this disc, I was quite surprised to find it one of the poorest CD reissues I have heard in some time; to my ears, the dynamic range sounds severely limited compared with the LP version; a real disappointment: caveat emptor."
3,A Classic but dated,"This album by the Moodies is a bit dated what with its references to Timothy Leary and so on. Very current at the time but not now. A different world today, unfortunately. However, that said, the usual Moody Blues attention to engineering sound, good melodic lines, and so on."
3,a bit of a let down,"As a strong supporter of the Moody Blues, i'll buy most anything of their's, good and bad. Orig- inally i bought this release a year after it appeared and thought it rated a four, because i didn't like songs 4-6, but after hearing the re- mastering(?) here, it lost another star."
1,disappointed,"I don't know where this CD was made, but it is a terrible recording. Not worth the free shipping."
2,The chord should remain lost!,"I'm a Moody fan for many years. Maybe that's the problem. There are just so many classic Moody songs and versions that have risen to the top and stay in the public consciousness. The ""lost Chord"" is a period piece and seems to be a very minor chord. Stay with the 'best' of the Moody songs and save your $s."
5,Great Moody Blues Reissue CD,"IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD is a great reissue of the Moody Blues' 1968 album. In addition to the 12 original songs, there are nine bonus cuts. The best songs here are the rocker ""Ride My See-Saw"" and the Timothy Leary ode ""Legend Of A Mind"", but there's other great stuff here as well. This album, along with any late 60s/early 70s Moody Blues album and the 1981 masterwork LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, is essential for any fan of either the Moody Blues and/or progressive rock."
5,Never sounded this good,"I've bought a number of stereo only SACDs that sounded good, but not noticeably better than the CD.Happily, that's not the case with this stunning remaster of the Moodies' best album. I've been listening to ""Lost Chord"" for 38 years, and it's never sounded anywhere near this good. SACD does offer a more precise soundstage (that is, the location of the channels) and a fuller, richer sound, and this is the best example of this I've heard so far.Like others, I'd have liked a surround sound mix, but with sound quality this good, I can live without it. If you have an SACD player, you should get this disc. As Eric Burdon once said, ""It *will* be worth it!"""
2,Sound quality sadly wanting,"I used to own this on vinyl and I really looked forward to hearing it again. Unfortunately, like so many of the old classics that are being re-released, the sound is nothing like it was on the LP. Transfer to digital technology has somehow left it muddy, flat, and with abrupt termination of tones. I'd strongly advise you listen to the samples before buying. Too bad, it's a really great album."
4,In Search of the Lost Chord,"Quite a lot of bonus material, and a modest upgrade in sound. Not quite as good sonically as Long Distance Voyager, but I think it's a good choice over the original release. Has any one reviewed a SACD version of this alblum?"
4,"great music, but questions","Some mysteries here.There's a mention of an outtake called ""Kings and Queens"" in the liner notes and I've seen it on import reissues, but is not included here.Also - to my ears, ""Ride My See-Saw"" sounds like it's in mono; as it might have been in the original - otherwise - stereo release. Perhaps because it was a single(?)"
1,remastered disappointment,"sorry but new remastered issue seems to be worse than not remastered version from eighties to me,e.g. I miss some percussion in Legend of a Mind or Voices in the sky, or low drums in Ride My See-Saw."
4,"""Then thru the leaves a light broke thru, a path lost for years lead us thru""","Another big hit from The Moody Blues.....and this time, I don't admire it as much as Days of Future Passed. The songs don't seem completely memorable to me, and the lyrics aren't as creative. Maybe it's because I didn't have the right mood while listening from beginning to end. But still, this is a very good one from the band, and it's high praise is well-deserved. The music sounds enchanting most of the time, the lyrics are pretty solid (even when compared to lyrics from DOFP), and the sound quality from this 2008 reissue is really nice (the bonus tracks are essential for those who consider The Moody Blues to be their favorite). In Search of a Lost Chord isn't at all that bad; it's just that it's not the most endearing album created from the band. Here's hoping that the next album (On the Threshold of a Dream) is a bit better.Grade: 7.6/10"
3,why has this album been abbreviated,"I have the {Deluxe Edition} of this album, with two discs. The first disc is the original album, and the second contains 15 hard-to-find tracks. That's 6 more than are offered here. Some of these tracks - notably ""Thinking Is The Best Way To Travel (from Top Gear)"" with its crisp flute accents - sound more impressive than the original studio version.If you just wanted the re-masterd album, this is a decent product. If you are more interested in the bonus material, you should be aware that some of it is missing in this offering. That's why I don't give it five stars."
1,great acid music from the 60s,"this album and Lsd introduced me to mind expansion in the 60s and now even without the acid ,my mind soarswow is all i can say"
1,"Horrible, Horrible Casebook","This is the WORST casebook I've had in law school so far (though the Torts Aspen casebook is pretty bad, as well). Explanations and background information are included AFTER the case, which makes little sense, and when you add in the swampy structure and paragraph-long cites this is incredibly hard to wade through. Reading the ""Notes"" is generally a waste of time--the author brings up many theories but skims them all, rather than explaining anything in depth, and is a little too fond of asking questions rather than providing answers about the concepts. Definitely order a supplement along with this casebook, because you won't be grasping the law on your own without an amazing teacher or a truly advanced form of intelligence."
4,A Review,"Book was fine, a little worse than they described but I don't mind the highlighting and writing inside so its fine."
1,Poorly organized and inconcise,"As a brief look at any well written treatise will show you, the organization of the notes and note cases in this book is inconsistent and ""without reference to any logical or reasonable formula whatever"" (See Baker v Carr). If you are a first year law student stuck with this book, beware! My suggestion is to find a good treatise like Chemerinsky's ""Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies"" to help you discern what you need to know. Otherwise, be prepared to spend endless frustrating hours trying to make some sense of it all!"
2,Irritated my skin....Found better,"After reading many reviews on here about Canus and actually trying it myself, I had no idea that it was filled with lots of preservatives and chemicals. It tended to irrirate my skin so I took the advice of another reviewer and also tried WendyLou's and happy to say that her products are great and now my skin is soft. I would highly recommend anyone that wants a good quality soap or for that matter lotion they try Wendylous natural bath. It's comoforting knowing you are not using a bunch of chemcals on your body too."
3,Rankin Bass Dogs in Dog Fight Cartoon,"Cartoon /Animation VideoAn ABC TV Saturday Morning Cartoon Cult Classic RANKIN / BASS PRODUCED CARTOON !Prince Heinrich of Weinerburg (a Doberman) has eloped with the Princess Sophie of Pretzelheim. Their monarchial fathers have been enemies, and Sophie's dad demands her return and her fiance's capture and sentencing. His request for ""all able-bodied men"" prompts the retired Red Baron (a blubbery old Great Dane) to board his old triplane, bringing along his ineffectual assistants,Putzi (an inarticulate cat) and Schnitzel (a wheezing dachshund). Catahari is a prime suspect in plotting the elopement, but she ends up having the hots for the Baron. The Prince and Princess set things straight with their fathers, the two kings patch up their differences and become in-laws, and Catahari chases after the Baron into the end.There was another similar cartoon from the same era titled MUSH as in M.U.S.H. a parody similar to MASH with Miltary Dogs. Produced by Filmation"
2,an interesting study of machiavelli with too much sense data,"pretty cool book. lots of action and violence. sex too. hard to understand in parts, but you will enjoy the pictures. highly recommended for the snob in your family. buy this book from amazon--it's much more expensive elsewhere. amazon is clearly the place to go for academic books!"
4,PLEASE IDENTIFY THE SONG BASED ON THESE LYRICS,GIVE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AND TAKE A LITTLE BIT LESS FROM EACH OTHER TONIGHT ................. YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE. WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE.WHAT MOODY BLUES SONG HAS THESE LYRICS?
4,Incredible!,"The Moody Blues had a wave of successful albums late 60's, early 70's. This was released 1969 and features some gorgeous ballads and uptempo tracks:The tracks to look out for are:2. Lovely to See You3. Dear Diary4. Send Me No Wine5. To Share Our Love7. Never Comes the Day8. Lazy DayI love this band, and feel blessed to know their music!"
4,Don't buy this one! Buy the 2008 Remaster,"This remaster pales by comparision to the new ones issued in 2008 as produced by Justin Hayard. The new remasters are phenomenal, incredible....if the one you are viewing here says issued in 1993...don't bother, it's okay but the new one is light years ahead. The new one also has many bonus tracks etc and is in a word, simply great!"
5,instant memories,"I had all seven albums (on vinyl)and played them to death... at last I have them back again, in their original form! 30 years just fell away!"
5,awesome,"this album is great. the first few songs are pretty good: the upbeat ""lovely to see you"", followed by the lovely and wonderfully mellow ""dear diary"" and then the laid back ""send me no wine"". ""to share our love"" is rather irritating though.but the album hasn't really even started yet. to me, the album _really_ begins right when ""so deep within you"" begins. wow! one of the greatest moody blues songs. you wouldn't think it'd get any better, until you hear ""never comes the day"", which is without a doubt the greatest most beautiful song on the album. these two songs are the power of this album, and right at the center.and then there's another lovably mellow song ""lazy day"", and by far the mellowest, ""are you sitting comfortably?"" a few words, and then a nice ending with ""have your heard"" with the awesome instrumental in the middlei love this album. almost as good as ""in search of the lost chord"".."
5,Eternally beautiful!!,"Back in the distant stone age when I got my first cassette player, I got this albums as my first one for it. Decades later I still love this album for it haunting, timeless beauty and never tired of it. Songs like SO DEEP WITH IN stays in the mind!!!The Moody Blue were there when I was preteen, with GO NOW and seem to be there at various points in my whole life. They endure with well-crafted music, evocative vocals of Justin Heywood and may the keep on rocking."
2,Mediocre,"When compared to 'In search of the lost chord' and 'To our children's childrens children, this release falls way short on both performances and sound quality. A few good songs but not enough to recommend it. Despite being remastered, the sound is not that much improved: very little high end and an overall 'thin sound'. 13 tracks/37.06."
5,Like hearing it for the first time,"The sound quality of this hybrid reissue is fantastic. It was like I was hearing the album for the first time. ""On the Threshold of a Dream"" is perhaps the Moody Blues' most complete concept album. It features some of their best songs and holds together from beginning to end. With this reissue, the softer tones of ""Never Comes the Day"" and the many layers of the ""Have You Heard/The Voyage"" suite finally can be heard as they were intended. The rarities include a BBC session of ""To Share Our Love"" that may be superior to the album version. Like all of these reissues, highly recommended to Moody fans and those looking to discover them."
5,'Moody Blues at their very best',"This album is one of the seven ablum first produced by the Moody Blues when they were at their peak. If it only had one record on titled 'So Deep Within You', it would be worth your while, if you don't believe me then listen to this song and see what you think.Regards Suzanne"
5,Moody Blues,Bought the CD On A Threshold Of A Dream by the Moody Blues and it is great. It was an easy purchase with Amazon and every thing went as promised. It came in the mail right away. I will buy again.
1,Be careful what you ask for,"The tape was of poor quality and would not play, the seller said he would refund the money for this poor tape but never did. the seller is a rip off."
5,Outstanding,"What a great read. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning about 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. And who better to narrate the story of this unit than the man who led it himself? One can even take lessons in leadership from this book, Theodore Roosevelt stresses that officers should lead from the front and examples of this are shown throughout the book. Most people who think of the Rough Riders generally think of Roosevelt, yet he gives credit where credit is due. He praises the men under his command and explains that throughout the campaign that his volunteers were on par with their regular army counterparts. Read this book if you want to learn about a unique chapter in U.S. Military history."
4,good book,Pres. Teddy Roosevelt wrote a very good and highly enjoyable book about the exploits of the Rough Riders that he commanded
5,Fascinating,"I really enjoyed this book. Roosevelt's voice came through his writing so well that I could easily imagine him in the room with me telling this story. It was much more engaging than some secondhand history of the Spanish-American war would have been. He described the hardships they had to endure, but it was his unfailing optimism and ability to see the good potential of his men that most caught my attention."
5,Accurate account of Rough Riders by one of them!,"My grandfather was a member of Troop A of the Rough Riders and wrote a series of articles for our local newspaper (Champaign, IL) on his experiences. After reading his comments and then reading the book written by Roosevelt I know first hand that Col. Roosevelt told it like it was. ""Rough"" was putting it mildly. My grandfather survived but had re-occurring bouts of maleria throughout his life. I transcribed his accounts into a family album for my children and grandchildren so he would not be forgotten. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone wanting to learn about our history."
4,"A tremendous view of TR's ""Splendid Little War""","What impresses me about this book is how it differs from most any other narrative of any war I have read before or since. The battlefields of Cuba take on Homerian proportions in this book. Roosevelt sings the praises of the brave soldiers of his regiment (not least of all, himself) and paints a vivid picture of the harsh (yet glorious) realities of war. Rough Riders is valuable as, more than anything, an example of historical paradigm. It is a perspective on the values of a people and a living example of the way in which war has been viewed as a part of the American experience."
5,The Rough Riders,American history has been a favorite of mine. This one was informative & well written. As much as I read getting it free was a great bonus.
4,The Rough Riders,"He liked the mention of different diseases in addition to the war saga. The references to the heroic people such as Teddy Roosevelt, Clara Barton, President Wilson were fantastic. I didn't like the repetition of the various characters..for example the characters are always descriptively titled and this is unnecessary."
4,Exciting and Educational,"Theodore Roosevelt spends to much of the book in praise of his men, the actual battles are done very well. An editor would have been good."
4,Like Watching The Movie..,"If you liked the movie the ROUGH RIDERS starring Tom Berringer at ""TR"", you will enjoy this book. It was apparent that Berringer and crew did their homework as many parts of the movie are found in the book almost word-for-word. Much detail.Nothing like history written by someone who was actually there."
2,Should have just reissued the original,"I love ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and so was completely disappointed by this paperback book edition of the story.The ""By Charles M. Schulz"" on the cover and in the listing hides the fact that the text is not by Schulz, but is ""adapted"" by other people. The text adaptation is painfully bad -- I could barely force myself to read it to my child the other night. The text is way too wordy, which contradicts the whole style of Schulz's comic strip, and changes key dialog of characters.The illustrations are okay, but why not just use the original drawings by Schulz himself?A book version of A Charlie Brown Christmas was printed in the 1960's; the publishers would have been smarter to reissue the original book rather than create this new version.If you want to have a book version of A Charlie Brown Christmas, I highly recommend that you spend a bit more money and buy the hardcover book, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas: the Making of a Tradition"". You won't regret it."
5,"Good Grief!, It's Christmas Everyone.","This delightful book successfully adapts the wonderful, classic television special of A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS to the page. The book is filled with many pictures from the special and most of the televised story remains intact in written form (about the only thing missing is Snoopy winning the decoration competition). The words and text to ""Hark! the Herald Angels Sing"" are even printed on the inside back cover. Children of all ages love this book and it is sure to be a family holiday favorite to read every year."
4,Cute Little Book,"I bought this to add to our collection of Christmas books that we read around the holidays to our kids. I love the story and thought it would be perfect. One thing I didn't notice (and it's my fault if I would have read closer) but this is a miniature version of the book. It is about 3"" by 3"". There are not pictures on every page, so your kids need to be able to pay attention to the words while you are reading until you get to a page with pictures. All in all though, it's a very cute story, the illustrations are cute and it will make a nice little decoration to put on the mantle for anyone to pick up and read."
5,Great for toddler!,"Perfect little stocking stuffer for a toddler. My daughter can fit this tiny little book in her play purse, it's gone on trips with us, she likes to open up to the picture pages and name the characters. We read it almost nightly!!!"
2,Watch the TV Show,"""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is one of the greatest television shows of all time, thanks to a classic script by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time.But this book just does not capture its flavor. The art is not by Schulz, and though loyal to his style, does not FEEL like Schulz. Couldn't they have used images from the actual show?Worse, important moments are lost, probably due to space constraints. For instance, Linus's stirring soliloquy, performed solo in the show, here takes place in a crowded room for storytelling purposes.I got this book for an office mate because she loves Schulz and because it was the only color Peanuts book I could find that was in the $5-10 price range dictated by our office Christmas pool.People may well love this book because they love the TV show (and there's nothing wrong with that), but I don't think anyone would ever love it for itself."
2,No Match for the Real Christmas Special,Pay attention to the reviews on this book - it is not the real thing and fails to capture the magic of the special you saw on TV as a kid. It does clearly state on the title page that this is adapted from the special. I failed to comprehend what that meant. It means the story is abrigded - incredibly abrigded. Unfortunately at the same time it is also wordy. Nothing along the lines of reading the Peanut comic strips. The drawings also look off. Again nothing like the comic strip. A true adaptation of this special would be appropriate for children and adults. This book may work for kids but if you plan to give it to an adult friend to capture the magic of Christmas(as was my intention) don't bother. Very disappointing.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"THIS WAS SO UNLIKE HIS OTHER BOOKS. VERY LITTLE ROMANCE, LOTS OF WAR. I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE WAR BOOKS, AND I SKIPPED THROUGH THE WHOLE MIDDLE (I DIDN'T MISS MUCH). I HOPE HIS NEXT BOOK IS BETTER."
2,Poor quality 30-amp contacts,"Had trouble getting the 30-amp connector onto to my male contacts. Not good internal contacts on the female part. Length is fine, just seems like the internal contacts are a bunch of seperate wires rather than a good solid piece of metal. Even had trouble getting it off the connection. Question how long the contacts will last."
5,Power your boat from a standard outlet (not a marina)? Get this.,"My boat sits in dry storage during the off-season, and I need to charge the batteries occasionally from a standard 120 VAC outlet. A normal outdoor extension cord and the Marinco Shore Power Pigtail Adapter solve the problem safely... just limit your draw to the capacity of the power outlet you are using (15 or 20A)."
1,"Don't buy, design flaw makes unuseable",Don't buy this product. The feeder hose comes out of the box at ground level and thus must make a 90 degree turn. The hose was kinked at this point as it came out of the box. There is no way to fix the kink. The only possible way this product can be used is if the left side is hung out over a deck or step so the hose can come straight down and make a gradual turn. I went to ACE and got an elbow and some hose clamps to make the turn. No way a customer should have to do that!Johnny
5,An amazing book!,"Father Joe Kempft writes beautifully! He has a very unique and deep understanding of human suffering. His book helped me tremendously when my mother died. During those dark days, this book answered my questions and helped me to develop a better relationship with God. The pain did not go away, but this book gave me a new perspective. It helped me to see God's light in the middle of my darkess hours. I had given many copies of this book to many of my friends (and High School students) who have lost loved ones. This book has a very special place in my heart."
4,Read the Book of Job First... Or Wait for the Movie,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
4,Cook's Select Non-Stick 8-Inch Omelet Pan in Black,Exactly as advertised! Highly recommended for breakfast!
2,Cook's Omelet Pan,It was not what I expected it to be. It is very light in weight. Was not what I thought an omelet pan was like. I was disappointed.
3,POST ORDER DISCOVERY,"I am anxiously awaiting delivery of my Performax 22-44 pro drum sander which I recently ordered, and am looking forward to evaluating its performance. One thing I would like to point out to those interested in this or any product, what shows in a picture on the web site doesen't mean that that's what your going to get.The picture of the Performax 22-44 Pro DrumSander shows casters, in and out feed tables, etc. I assumed were a part of the complete package. I was wrong to assume. Pictures portraying a package should state ""Shown with Optional accessories not included."""
2,an ok set of headphones,"I thought that it mentioned that this headset had a switch for changing between mono and stereo...I was wrong. Otherwise the head phones are good if you don't like sticking things in your ears or your ears sweat when you where the old foam ones. These sound clear to me(but take in account that I am deaf in one ear), just make sure you use them in a quite area (ie. Library, cafe, bedroom)or atleast places that you want to hear beyond just the music (ie. the park, the beach, while napping)."
2,OK,"They sound fine but I don't find them to be comfortable at all, too tight and not enough padding on the foam."
1,Do not waste your money!,"This is cheaply made. The drive after formating constantly needs repair by windows, losing files. Pin works apart in travel. Big and bulky. Like carrying a mag-lite. Good idea, just not well executed."
2,The pen dosen't work,"great idea, but since 1/3 of the product does not work... kind of useless to carry a ""pen"" in your pocket that wont write."
4,"Not as good as Ringworld, but still good.","I read this in a couple of days just because I had nothing else to do. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed Ringworld more. The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly, like Niven was tired of writing about the Ringworld and just wanted to get it over with. That's not necessarily a bad thing, because I was tired of reading about the Ringworld at this point. I should have put a buffer between Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers by reading another book, perhaps something from the Ender Wiggin series. I still recommend Ringworld Engineers if you enjoyed Ringworld as it answers numerous questions you may or may not have had. After reading Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers, I think I'm going to pick up a few more novels by Niven."
2,A disappointment,"The original was recommended to me by a friend, and I enjoyed it enough to pick up the sequel, but after reading it I can see why she didn't bother to recommend this one too.From the title you would guess that this is about the engineers of Ringworld, but in actuality the entire thing is about alien sex. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but only a slight one. There is a plot, but it's strung together and ultimately overshadowed by Louis running from place to place in order to have sex with aliens.Disappointing and somewhat sad to see an author run his most well-known creation into the ground like this, presumably just to make a few extra bucks. This is one of those cases where it would have been better to just leave the original to stand alone."
2,THIS is why I don't read much science fiction,"The first novel was fun - the exploration of a new world, an introduction to new characters in Niven's 'Known Universe'. But this time around, it's a whole lot of two-dimensional characters sitting around discussing theoretical science and (like another customer review pointed out ) leaping to astounding conclusions. Armchair science in the form of an uninvolving novel. And if I never read about 'risathra' again, it'll be too soon..."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This sequel to Ringworld, basically back by popular demand, takes a more in depth look at what it is like to actually live there, and at the beings that actually do.More of the construction and engineering issues are also looked at, unsurprisingly.Louis and Speaker To Animals return."
4,Filling in the gaps of Ringworld,"While the characters and the plot are rather flat, Niven is able to fill in many of the scientific gaps that were left in the orginal book. He answers many of the particular problems that would arise in the construction of the Ringworld and discusses many of the social issues that would arise upon the Ringworld. Despite the weaknesses of the book it is an enjoyable trip back to the novel creation of Larry Niven"
1,"buy the book, not the audio!","The narration of this audio book is horrendous! Practically no voice modulation at all. I'd rather have listened to the Microsoft Accessbility Narrator. If you want this one, buy the book instead!"
3,"Has answers, has conflict, but not as enjoyable as Ringworld","Granted, I couldn't put it down, but that's just how I am when I want to know the answer to something. I was dissapointed at how short it was, and there is no sense of time. Events which are suposed to take a week or more seem to fly by in minutes. I noticed this lack of time in many places.It wasn't as sex-filled as some of the reviews say....I was actually expecting more sex after reading the reviews here. Although somewhat dissapointed by the book, I was satisfied to have answers to some of the questions left by the first book, but I think this book just opens up more questions. I still am womdering ""What happens now?"""
2,A very dissapointing sequel.,"I really enjoyed Ringworld, in fact it was one of my favorite books of all time, but I found this a poor sequel. True, it does explain some of the mysteries of the first, but it never does it in a way that excites the imagination or makes you want to keep reading. The plot was dull and uneventful and the ending left a lot to be desired. Even the interactions between the characters seemed predictable and cliched"
3,Maybe it's just too outdated,"As a followup to Ringworld, which I enjoyed, this book was disappointing.While he discusses at length descriptions of futuristic technology, Niven cleverly obscures any working detail about the technologies which help make it appear as ""timeless"", but the age of the story still seems obvious.Sort of like watching old StarTrek episodes.I had a difficult time buying into the character development in the first book and this book is even more bizarre.I enjoy science fiction but this story just wasn't fun for me."
4,scifi classic,"The original and informal trilogy that began with Protector ends here. There's a fair bit more character development here than in Ringworld. I remember not liking this book as much as Ringworld, and now the tables are turned, which does I guess reflect that change in reading tastes. The whole trilogy is worth reading for scifi fans, as some pretty interesting ideas are present (evolution, life cycles, stellar engineering, superconductivity...just to name a few), and it is easy reading as well."
2,For all guitar players....?,"""Variax Acoustic 700 in natural is a breakthrough product for any guitarist""....as long as you are right handed."
1,What a mistake!!!!!,"I truly admire to Doro and her work, but this CD is a way off the track. Warlock's fans - strongly avoid it."
5,"""101..."" is a Success ""Bat Signal"" Calling Out Your Greatness.",I picked this book up and literally could not put it down. Michael Angier has a unique perspective and a storyteller's style to make powerful concepts seem basic and unthreatening. In his approach he creates a road anyone can travel to enhance their life. Each chapter is compact with a significant take-away. 101 is powerful and pithy wisdom you can immediately apply to your life. I highly recommend this book for yourself and for anyone you care about.
3,"Too much Hawaii, not enough mystery","I have enjoyed all of the books in this series, but ""Flaming Luau"" was a disappointment. It started out with a great premise - a trip to an exotic locale, a mystery husband - but then it just fizzled. The elements of the mystery did not tie together well, and there were just too many sidelines. The plot reminded me of a hyperactive child, bouncing from one thought to another but not making connections between them.Perhaps the book was just too overloaded with characters and it was difficult to concentrate on what was happening to each one of them. And, in my opinion, there was just too much information about Hawaii. It was a distraction, rather than an addition.It's still a fairly fun read, which is why I gave it three stars. However, my advice is to borrow it from a friend, the library, or wait for the paperback."
3,"Disappointed--not a lot of story here, just a big ad for HI","I had been looking forward to this addition to the Madeline Bean series for some time. I found it a bit of a disappointment. The book struck me as an author's excuse to use a trip to Hawaii as a tax writeoff. ""Let's see, what to do today. THIS sounds like fun. Now how can I work it into the book?"" It just didn't seem to have the strong plot that some of her other books have had.That said, Jerrilyn Farmer is a talented writer. Her books are enjoyable. This wasn't bad, it just wasn't up to the level of the other books in the series."
3,Not the best of the series,"I love this series, but was disappointed in this installment. It was a good mystery, and of course I enjoy the recurring characters, but the writing was really laden down with drawn out descriptions of Hawaii culture, traditions, history, etc. Seriously, you could have taken all of that out and had an entirely separate book. I found myself skimming across a lot of that to get back to the main plot. This definitely took away from my enjoyment of this book."
2,Skip it,".Count me among the legion of AA members who think this book is a buggering mess. Bill Wilson wrote it while in the midst of a 5 year depression and it shows. Save for the essays on Steps 1 and 8, this book leaves most people more confused than enlightened.I gave it two stars cause some of the Tradition essays have some good stuff if you're willing to wade into them.."
3,"""Don't judge a book by it's cover!""","Although this was the correct book, the cover was not the one that appears online. What I wanted was the content, but I was little disappointed that the cover was not the same."
5,Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions,I was very satisfied with this transaction. I recieved the book within the specified time and it was in excellent condition. I was pleased with my experience with this seller and would use him again. I would also recommend using him to others.
5,12 steps and traditions rock,Part of working the program is literature - the twelve steps and traditions book is wonderful - practical and very helpful. I listen to a step workshop on CD that you can get from glennkaudio.com named Lila R. - her workshop is based from this book.
4,AA Textbook,"This book is a classic and is used as a workbook or textbook in most Alcoholics Anonymous Programs.I devote an hour meeting to each chapter, as do many other group meeting leaders. It would bevery helpful to have this text available on Kindle"
4,Just what I ordered,"This book was required for a class I'm in. It is old, but I was thrilled to get it so cheaply. No e-mail from company saying it had been shipped, but it did arrive quickly."
5,Serious help for positive personal change,"If you try to read this like a novel, you'll miss the whole point. Repititiously apply this to a broken life. This is about personal growth and positive change. The methodology and results are nothing short of miraculous!"
2,My former partner and myself...,"...used to refer to this book as the ""Twelve Swedish Traditions"". We lived in St. Paul Minnesota. If you get it, you get it.The one redeeming factor of this Treatise is that it is a bit more interesting in composition then the infamous Big Book (Of Boredom). I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here so I'll just stop."
3,Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions,The book was older than I expected and had an odor. Otherwise it was okay.
5,12 and 12 has taught me a new way of life.,"Before I got to AA I did not know how to live life sober. I could not function without drinking. Alcohol was my life. Alcohol destroyed me and left me with nothing. By the grace of God I was put into the rooms of AA. In the rooms I found a sponsor who bought me a Big Book and a 12x12. The program in the 12x12 saved my life. It taught me a way of life which I had never dreamed possible. By reading this book and attending meetings, working with other alcoholics--I am able to live life sober. I am truly happy, joys and free. I owe it all to my higher power, the program and people in AA. Thank you AA. -Greatful Recovering Alcoholic San Diego, CA"
4,DON'T CONFUSE AL-ANON WITH RELIGION,"The negative comments left by a few are fairly ignorant, in that Al-anon is NOT a religion NOR does it EVER suggest that a person BE religous in order for the program to work. It asks people to be SPIRITUAL, which is entirely different. Those who don't understand what this book is about (which IS part of the process by the way) should GO to an Al-Anon meeting and get themselves educated, instead of JUST reading a book and then discounting the entire program and book out of ignorance. They are doing themselves AND their loved-one a HUGE disservice!"
5,More about the steps...,"This is a good place to go for more information when you're working the steps. All of the information necessary to work the steps is in the Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous), but you may find some helpful ideas and things to discuss here. Finally, the Traditions didn't exist when the Big Book was written, so a good discussion of each one is available here. A lot of the stories you hear old timers tell (""Rule 62"") are from the traditions section of this book."
2,Bad headphones!,"These headphones are just a fake, they are advertised as running headphones but the truth is that it does not even fit well in your ear just when walking. It hurts you ears. I would not recommend this item to anybody."
3,"Decent Textbook, but reading a Rule Book is more Helpful","Normally a law school text book is filled with case after case. Well for those of you who hate reading case after case, then this is the book for you.On average there is only 1 case per chapter, with the remainder of the chapter devoted to ABA opinions and or Law review articles. While the articles are insightful, they really don't give you any more of an understanding of the ABA Rules, than just reading the rules with the commentary. What is good about this text, however, are the discussion problems at the beginning of the chapter and the multiple choice problems at the end of each chapter. These problems will help you better understand and think about the ABA Model rules.Overall the book isn't too bad, but you if you have a copy of the ABA rules along with the commentary then this book becomes worthless for the most part."
5,Where Are They Now?,I have been trying to find out what happened to Epidemic for years. [...] They were the complete opposite of what the music industry has been trying to force down our throats (i.e. adolescents that can't play more than two chords and mask an impotent vocal range by effeminately screaming asinine lyrics). I am still angry that a band with such substance in their message and well crafted ballads was apparently dropped by their label.
2,pretty boring,"I only give this album 2 stars for 2 songs: Walk Away and Catalyst, those are the ONLY good songs on an otherwise sleep-inducing album. These guys are missing something fundamental, cannot describe it but whatever it maybe, I hope they fix it and improve for the next record...if they ever make one that is. Deem my review unhelpful if you wish, it won't make change the fact that these guys churned out quite the below-average cd.Oh and to Ryan Munn, you need to stop flapping your gums about things you know nothing about. Just because I don't like this cd as much as you do doesnt mean I'm not a fan of a certain genre of music. Stop being so ignorant."
4,Decent oil,"I only noticed a very slight difference in power from using this oil. It does keep my air cooled engine a slight bit cooler. Interresting green color visible through the oil sight glass. All things considered, it is rather pricey and I noticed more power using Rotella full synthetic oil."
1,My printer is possessed,"I have a whole lotta issues with this printer. Mine has a mind of its own and only works when it wants to work. Occasionally it will try to hit me with, black ink low - even though its brand new. I'd take it out, shake it, put it back in, then it tells me my color ink is low, even though I just changed both cartridges that week.It also gets violent at times. The cradle wit the cartridge heads will fly back and fourth very violently smashing into each side over and over again until I unplug the thing... like it is now.I'll plug it back in to see what happens, but I think the time is right to get a new printer."
5,"Nice, Economical Printer","This printer is a bit past its prime, with regards to its features. Other printers offer more, but this little guy is a champ. He works well, is very reliable, quiet and fast.We have not experienced the jamming problems cited by other folks."
2,Not the Tape,"I was looking for a CD version of the tape entitled ""God Bless the Child"". This isn't it. The tape has a bunch of Billie Holiday classics: ""I can't pretend"", ""Ghost of Yesterday,"" ""Falling in Love again"", ""Jim"", ""I Cover the Waterfront"", etc. This CD has the same album title as the tape, but bears no relation to it, except for the title song. The tape is a lot better."
5,Awesome shoes!,I bought these shoes to wear for work and they are so comfortable that I can wear them all day and still walk a mile home after work. These also look great with tights and a skirt or dress them down with jeans. Fits true to size. I was so pleased with these shoes that I bought 2 more pairs in different colours!!!
5,Comfortable Walking Shoe,Great shoe for colder days for good walking comfort and style. I get a lot of people saying how much they like these shoes when I wear them with skirts. I like them because the are so comfortable and low heeled and make me look good.
5,Rave reviews from a Skechers 'ho,"This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Warning! I wear a 9.5 street size- but in this particular model I wear a 9- there are other Skechers that I need the 9.5 but this one is better a half size down. I have it in two sizes and three colors! It's the perfect travel shoe! I must have walked an easy 10 miles a day in them and my feet felt WONDERFUL. I plan on taking all of them to Europe with me this summer as well. They can be washed easily if you step in mud or (yuck) other ""stuff"" on the ground. They dry overnight. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!"
2,Disappointed,"These shoes were comfortable when I first tried them on, but when walking I noticed my right foot leaning inwards and upon closer inspection the right heel dips down slightly. Are they seconds or did I get a dud pair?? Also, I got blisters on each foot the first time I wore them, which was extremely painful walking back to my car 1.5 km away after work! I didn't think I need to wear socks. I'm keeping them as they've been worn otherwise I would return them. I'm hoping I'll get used to the heel leaning part and the blisters won't be an issue once they're worn in. They do look nice though and were initially very comfortable, hence the 2 stars."
3,Super Cute Shoes,"I have had a few pairs of these in different colors, black, white and brown. Sadly, after a while the velcro wears out and the strap comes apart while walking. Drives me nuts. Sometimes I have cut the strap off as the shoe still seems to have alot of life letf in it but they are not as comfortable, after my alteration. And I do agree that the smelly feet thing is a bit of a problem. It is too bad as these are my favorite shoes..."
4,easy return,This is more a review about the easy return than the product itself. I own many pairs of these in different colors. You can't find them at the store any more so I ordered here. One shoe came with glue lumps under the sole that wouldn't even out. The other shoe was fine. Amazon refunded the money and I didn't have to pay return shipping.
5,Greatest Little Shoe Ever!,"Do you want a comfortable shoe that looks good too? You have to try this one; it is very supportive and looks great with pants, skirts etc. I normally wear a wide width in shoes but I wanted something different and stylish so I took a chance and tried them on I couldn't believe that they fit! I am very happy that I found them. I can wear them all day shopping and no longer have to stop and rest my tired achy feet. Now the only problem I have is deciding which color and style I am going to buy next! Good job Skechers keep them coming."
5,Great shoes for commuting to work,"I bought my first pair a year ago for a week long tour of DC. I've been wearing them almost daily to work since then and finally bought a second pair, not because the first wore out, but just to have another color to go with light colored slacks."
5,skechers review,I absolutely love these shoes. I love them so much I bought a black pair too. They are very comfortable. I get compliments on them daily.
2,No support,I read all the reviews and was expecting a great shoe. Not worth $50. There is no arch support and it was very uncomfortable on my big toe....where the scoop on the top of the shoe is. Very disappointed. Go with j-41 instead.
5,Comfort,My once in a lifetime trip to Italy could not be troubled by uncomfortable shoes. I needed a comfortable shoe that did not make me look like a tourist ( Europeans do not wear tennis shoes like we do in the us)These shoes walked through Europe. They had enough style to take me from Pompeii to a Rome bistro. Nothing is more comfortable. I am hooked. I will buy more.
2,NOT WIDE ENOUGH,"The fit is tight. I wear a size 10M but these are narrow. My big toe knuckle rubs the edge and becomes very sore. I have to were socks to prevent blisters making the fit much tighter. I sit driving all day so I just wear them when I need to walk. Cost too high for my amount of wear. I like this style of shoe for work. I had found the brown version at Payless Shoes three years ago; that's how long it took to wear that pair out. This year Payless did only the black, white, and some other bright colors. That made me sad. Then after my search for brown athletic mary janes I became sadder. Very hard to find! Finally I found these."
4,cute shoes,"I think these shoes are adorable. I bought 2 colors although I'm not sure if they're supposed to be worn with socks/without socks. Also, not sure what kind of outfit to wear them with....jeans, shorts? They are very comfortable though. It's probably just my ""fashion sense"""
3,"Comfortable, but no arch support.","This shoe is very comfortable. I've never worn it without socks so I don't know about the stink factor that I've read about. I do have to say that this shoe has no, or minimal arch support. There appears to be some kind of arch support, however the way the shoe is built, it feels weirder than wearing your typical no arch support flat shoe."
4,Great for winter,"Great shoe for winter, but too warm for summer. You need an insert or socks for this shoe or you will sweat too much in them. Very comfortable otherwise."
1,Bad material - you won't want to wear it.,"The shoes are very cute, but I am WARNING you! After wearing them several times, they start smell. I am guessing our other reviewers perhaps bought the shoes recently. -Just to clarify, the is the only pair of shoes I have this problem with :). The material doesn't breathe at all, and the smell is seriously unbearable. After all my efforts at cleaning and spraying, I just had to throw them away. What a waste! My roommate also had the same problem with a brown pair (mine were black.)"
3,"Love them, but...","I'd have given these shoes 5 stars if the heel didn't rub. It seems as if the top edge curves in, slightly, making an otherwise comfortable shoe a complete nightmare to wear -- unless you bandage your Achilles tendon with something that can protect it from blistering. I have such a difficult time finding wide-enough shoes for my feet, that I put up with doing this with these shoes in the hope that the heel edge will flatten, making them comfortable."
5,"Great shoe, but test your fit","This is fantastic shoe. My only problem was buying them in medium. Depending on how a shoe runs, I can wear 9.5 wide or 10 medium or sometimes 10W. No wide sizes were available online anywhere for this shoe in my size for a very long time, so I got the 10M. It just didn't fit so I returned them. Eventually I was able to get the 9.5W online and it's perfect! This is one of the best shoes ever - comfortable but stylish. Works well at the job or for casual events."
2,"can you say ""overpronation?""","My shoes are fantastically comfy, and surprisingly easy to run in, but for the life of me I can't walk in them without my feet turning inwards. These are my only shoes that do that (it's not just my funny legs) and I really can't wear them, even though they are cute."
4,Cute shoe but heel counters really stiff at first,"Cute shoe, not as cushy as the same type in shape-up style. The heel counter was really stiff and took wearing a few times with different socks to soften up a bit. I like them with tights and skirts and with black socks and jeans or slacks. Versatile. I wore the shape-up version for 2 years and that's when I ordered these. They are true to size and fit well."
3,Comfortable but straps are short,"I have another pair of sketchers and I love them. They also have straps. These are comfortable as well, but the strap is a little too short to stay affixed to the velcro (and i don't have wide feet)."
3,review,"cheaper price, but shoe kind of hurts my back heel. Have to break it in or use a bandaid for extra cushion"
5,Cute and comfortable,"Very cute with jeans, comfortable at first, did a lot of walking my first time wearing them and by the end of the day my feet were killing me..I still love them though."
2,not for me,I am so disapointed but don't think it's the shoes fault totally. These are for my work and don't seem to be bothering anyone else but me. The way the mary jane style cuts across your foot in the front rests right on the bone of your foot. They absolutely kill my feet to the point that I can't wear them. I've tried thick socks as a cushion but it doesn't help. Standing or sitting they are fine but I can't walk without them hurting.They are not very sturdy either. If you tend to turn your feet at all they won't support your foot. I normally love Sketchers but these were not what I expected.
5,Excelente,"Contenta con la compra, tal cual como se muestra en la imagen, el envió eficiente y todo rápido, excelente calidad"
5,Cool and comfy,"This little Mary Jane is really comfortable and stylish at the sametime.I needed something for work and then just casual dressy, so I bought this Skecher.I feel I have a dressy sneaker, attractive and at the same time I don't even realize I have them on. I would recommend buying two because they are very popular. Very happy w/product."
4,Good little shoes,"Exactly what I hoped for and expected in terms of fit and comfort, though I don't like the dual-fabric business as much as I thought I would."
5,Excelentes zapatos!,"Los compré hace 4 meses y aún los sigo usando, no molestan para nada, son tan cómodos que puedo caminar todo el día y usarlos todo el día que no molestan en los pies ni tampoco sientes cansancio en los mismos, este modelo que yo lo llamo el convencional es excelente, ya he comprado varios en otros colores y son realmente un buen calzado! Eneris Molina de Licón"
3,Not that impressed,"I've had this for a few years on my Jet Contractor table saw. I'm not that impressed with it for the following reasons:1) After a year of light use one of the rear wheel locks stopped working.2) The swivel wheels are flimsy and don't lock well. This makes the saw rock when pushing larger lumber through it.3) It is hard to manipulate the locking mechanism on the front wheels.3) The base isn't level from front to back - it's about 3/8"" higher at the front.On the good side, The steel frame is easily adjustable and is reasonably strong for the weight.It could be a better base if they put front supports that lifted the swivel wheels off the ground. I may actually drill through the wheel support bracket and install my own supports to lift the wheels."
1,jet universal tool momil base,it stinks it rolls very hard it turns very hard it is very very hard to control it is nothing like the htc models
2,Jet Mobil Base,I had purchased the Jet Mobil Base with the Jet Jointer. In order to make the Jointer fit this base I added a piece of 3/4 plywood. Still not being satisfied with this match up I replaced the Mobil Base with the HTC base made for this Jointer. The Jet Jointer and Jet Mobil Base is a bad match up. It's a good quality Universal Mobil Base and I will find a use for it with some other equipment. Just not with the Jet Jointer.
2,Not very maneuverable,"The fixed rear wheels on this base make it difficult to move in any direction except straight. Also, it does not fit a 6"" closed based jointer such as the Jet very well (even though it is listed as an accessory for that jointer). I had to do some cutting and drilling to make it workable."
2,Wheels move when locked,"I've been using this base under a jet contractor's saw with cast iron top for a few months now. The base is very sturdy, strongly made, and rolls smoothly. The big problem is that the wheels don't lock solidly, and I can't trust the saw to stay in place when I cut a large piece of plywood, etc. I'll probably buy a different base for the saw and use this one on something else like a drill press that only needs vertical support. Bottom line is it doesn't do the job for a table saw."
3,the Three Painters,"Unfortunately, the instructions that come with this kit contains a phrase, (approximately) that there are no replacement parts available for any of the items in the kit.The air brush works well.The touch-up spray works wellThe full size spray would be good for painting cars, but the oriface is too large for the finishes we use on wood.The price is agreeable, but, old saw is too true. It's worth the money, but barely."
1,AMERO-TRASH PRODUCTION,"Levine in the pit and Domingo celebrating 30 years at the Met while equalling Caruso's record of 17 consecutive opening nights: What could possibly go wrong?Ah, those ugly, drab, sets! And those stupid costumes! And the hands! The hands! True, this production is not as idiotic as most Rings, and the overall presentation is ALMOST somewhat reminiscent of ye olde Gaza. But the overall effect was annoying enough to wreck the entire concept.I have never heard the Met orchestra sound more lethargic and uninterested. And the staging was as clumsy as could be. For example, the Israelite's rebellion--or whatever it was in Act I--couldn't have been any cornier if the dragon from ""Siegfried"" dropped in for a cameo, and the bacchanal could have used a massive injection of Viagra. At least the destruction of Dagon's temple was accomplished in record time. (About three seconds by my reckoning.)Bottom line: if you are looking for a traditional staging of this opera, keep looking."
3,"Distracting, Disappointing Staging","A production of a Grand Opera should be one-third vocal, one-third orchestral and one-third visual. The one-third visual should be one-half costuming and one-half sets/set decoration. In this production the lack of comprehensible sets and the garishness of some of the costumes detracts from the vocal and orchestral. And interestingly, the costuming of Miss Borodina is superior, while all remaining costuming is ""over the top"" or sadly deficient in character. It is difficult to appreciate the vocal and orchestral aspects of the production when the visual is so distracting. In the last thirty years or so, it is unfortunate that opera stage directors have been allowed to engage in such unchecked imagination."
3,"One song contains the word ""heck""","I'm more conservative but I'm sure there are other parents out there that are like me. I wish I knew this before I bought the CD and played it to my child. One of the songs contain the word ""heck."" If you're okay with that, then this is a fun cd with a good collection of songs. But I bought this CD to play in the car and at home daily. And you know how kids like having their favorite CD played ALL the time. I know ""heck"" is not a bad word, per se, but it's not one that I want my toddler hearing, saying or singing regularly."
5,DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!!,"The music and performances are great!! The ""behind the scenes"" and ""the making of"" extras are very entertaining. My favorite is him trying to teach Michael Jordan his dance moves.Seeing the awards ceremonies take on new meaning now. To look into the face of wrongful persecution and see the angelic heart of one who wished only to give was very emotional. For one who couldn't bear to see others suffer, he suffered the most for caring.Dangerous: The Short Films completes my MJ video collection. Losing him has affected me more than I could have ever thought possible. But after viewing this DVD I remember why we will ALWAYS love Michael Jackson!!"
5,Fantastic,"Anyone who loves Michael Jackson like I do, has to have this DVD, it is fantastic. Michael Jackson is the best entertainer of all time. He not only writes his own songs , but he also has a beautiful voice, heart and soul and dances like no other. This DVD is a must . RIP Michael."
4,Dangerous on DVD,"I agree with most of the other reviewers on this product. The only thing I have to add is the ""Dangerous"" music video was the one that looks the most interesting, but it seemed to be only a promo video. It just ends and you see the credits. Too bad they didn't expand on that one. Michael Jackson always has the best music videos out there. I wished he made more:("
5,GREAT!,you can't mess with the KING OF POP.the Music is slamming REmember the time.it's about time somebody showed how Eygpt really Looked? JAm was great as music&video.IN The Closet was slammin' as well the song is still tight&the Video with NAomi Campbell is tight.NAomi Looks Great.Black Or WHite was a catchy song but the Video was Groundbreaking.a fantastic OVerView on the KING OF POP.
5,A Michael Jackson Masterpiece,I was blown away by the sheer magnitude of genius displayed in these videos. Some I had never seen. I will move this to the top of my collection.
5,Now this was awesome!,This was awesome! I purchased both video history's and the dangerous concert. I am so glad that I purchased this one as well. You will be entertained.
5,mj videos,"Michael Jackson - one of the most musically talented entertainers. I'm happy to have this DVD in my collection. Full versions of his ""films"" which are otherwise difficult to find. Love this DVD."
3,"Slightly Disappointed, but i still love Michael","i was so exited to get this DVD, but i guess i didn't read the Amazon reviews carefully enough, because i didn't know that there wasnt a real video for Dangerous, but it was only the song with clips behind it. this dvd would be better if it wasnt consisted of so much clips, and tearful speeches by michael. it should have been more videos. real videos, not clips. it was still good. i really enjoyed ""In the Closet"". thats basically the highlight of the dvd. i'm just glad i didnt have to spend more than 11.43$ for this half-ass tape! hope this helps."
2,I thought it would be better,Couldn't wait to try this one ... but when it came it was only average.
4,great!,"We have tried three or four different brittles and fudges from this company and they are all terrific. I don't know what companies the other reviewer was comparing them to, to call them average. If there are some better let me know!"
3,"Lots of good info, but a glaring error","This documentary is filled with lots of good information and many interesting stories. I learned much from it. However, at one point, the narrator refers to North America at the time of European colonization as an ""Empty Continent"". Such a gaff calls into question the perspective of the entire program. In describing the oppression of the Jewish people and their struggle to overcome it, the program does an immense disservice to that struggle by implicitly denying the oppression of another people - an oppression that all Europeans contributed to."
5,The hope Within,""" The Hope Within"" I have just begun reading this last book. The whole series has been writtn so feelingly that I feel as if I am living Dianne""s life with her."
4,Heirs of Montana Books,These four books kept my attention and felt like I was included in the story. Enjoyed the story very much.
5,Hope,"What a great way to end a series! Not everything hearts and flowers, but a wonderful story told realistically! Great read!"
4,A wide ranging selection,"This volume collects two dozen essays by the brilliant anarchist critic Paul Goodman. The introduction by Goodman's disciple Taylor Stoehr presents a cogent and intimate portrait of Goodman's contribution to pyschology, providing useful context for his wide ranging selections of Goodman's psychological writings: his engagements with Freud and Reich, and his psychological approaches to literature, sociology, and self-knowledge.As always, Goodman thrills with his agile, vivid, humane prose, and the book is chock full of penetrating aphorisms.As the collection is largely of short works written for periodicals, it can sometimes feel a little breezy; those looking for a more comprehensive picture of Goodman's psychology would do well to seek out his ""Gestalt Therapy."""
1,Absolutely Awful,"It is difficult to imagine a Nina Simone cd that I wouldn't like, but here is one. You often can barely hear her over the lousy, reimagined, music. Don't wast your money; buy a real Nina Simone cd."
1,Nina would be disappointed,Nina Simone would be so disappointed with this. It just sounds like someone superimposed lyrics and new age groove music. It sounds like two different pieces of music playing at the same time. What a shame.
4,Nina Simone Revisited,"Yeah, I know it's also remixed and reimagined. I'm a huge Nina Simone fan, and this album definitely did not disappoint. I have to say that some of the songs are a lot better than others, but the people that worked on this album did a great job of shining light on a whole new way to enjoy her music. I've played it for dozens of my friends, and the consensus is that it rocks.I like to play it during those late night drives through the hills or while I'm cooking. . . but your results may vary.I gave it ""4 stars"" because she has some other (way better in my opinion) songs that they should/could have used in this album. . . but hopefully they'll release a follow-up."
5,Buy this one folks...,"To the other reviewer - ""under 10 bucks?"" Honey, true Diva's don't come cheap!This is one of the best remix albums i've heard and is certainly worth every penny. Being a big fan of the Verve remixed albums - this work is in the same vein and masterful. Nina is exceptional and this compilation compliments her artistry perfectly."
3,If you are a true Nina Simone fan.....,"I have been listening to Nina Simone for 20 years, before it was cool! I think this album of remixes for the most part, are true to the spirit of her music. If you are a Nina Simone fan, you'll appreciate this album. Of course, not as good as her originals, but they are fun."
1,"un-inspired, even boring","a great amazing artist, being reduced to un-inspired monotonic mixes, making you want to skip to the next tune- which sounds exactly the same as the previous one. The Verve re-mixed collection had a great mix for one of Simone's hits. this collection attempts to do the same- and fails."
1,Incompetent insulting remixes of one of music's greatest talents,"A few years back I purchashed an amazing CD of Shirley Bassey remixes and, for who knows what reason, I was under the impression that it was from this ""Remixed and Reimagined"" series so I purchased Nina's CD without hesitation.I am a HUGE Nina Sinone fan and thought that there was much potential for ""reimagining"" some of her songs, but you will never find out from this mess. Rarely have I encountered such an unlistenable product that I wanted to stompt it to pretend that it enver existed. If you like Nina, stay away no matter how hip the marketing concept may sound."
5,Must BUY video,"This is a must see, must BUY video. Even if your an old matchbox twenty fan or a new one. This tape will keep you entertained over and over again!ENJOY!"
5,A must have for any video collection,"This is one of the best concert videos I have ever seen. The concert footage is fantastic and it also contains stories about the band and their travels. The guys from Matchbox 20 tell the stories themselves and they are a very humorous bunch of guys. It brought back memories of the concert I went to, including the feelings of excitment and exhiliration that I felt on the night. It truly made me feel like I was back there again. An un-forgetable experience. I have this video in my collection and I suggest you should have it in yours."
5,Fantastic!!!,"Im from the UK and when I bought this video, I didn't realise it would turn up in american format. Luckly my boyfriend had a VCR that plays VHS.We watched the video (as he is also a fan) and it was absolutely fantastic! I absolutely love MB20's albums and really wanted to hear them live. I was definately not dissappointed. What a superb video, they have such a sound. I really enjoyed the music videos at the end. Living in the UK, you don't see many MB20 Music videos over here. So it was a treat! Buy the video, excellant value for money."
5,This video really shows what matchbox 20 is all about.,The performances are unbelievable! The behind scenes show what they like to do on the road also things you've probably never known about the group. If you like matchbox 20 this video will make you love them and if you love them it's going to make you love them even more. I love it and recommend it to anyone!
3,Get what you pay for,"As other reviews have said these headphones are not the most comfortable, unless you have a very small head. The sound quality is pretty average, and the bass is weak. The volume controls work great and for under $10 it's a good buy overall.EDITED 1/5After further use of these headphones I feel like the sound quality is better than I thought before. I found that the poor bass was due to the source that I had my headphones plugged into. The bass is really a strength for this porduct. For the price these are really a good buy."
2,So So,"Just received this, Knowing that it was a low end unit, I didnt expect much, for the price I guess they are ok, there was alot of feedback when moving the connector plugged into the unit, might be a short in the plug somewhere, so for that reason It lost a star. I am sure there are better Headphones for the same money."
3,Decent set of headphones for the price,"I bought these because 1. I wanted to replace a more expensive, but similar, pair of Sony headphones and 2. I sit at my desk and listen to music while working. They are comfortable (I wore them for an hour straight with glasses on) and the adjustable length is also a plus. I didn't find much use for the volume control on the wire since I am usually within reach of the stereo or computer. Also, when they say ""super bass"", they really mean it. On songs with heavy bass, the treble is nearly drowned out. This wasn't a big problem for me since I rarely listen to dance, rap, or club music.If you are an audiophile concerned about the depth and lushness of sound, look elsewhere. If you are a casual listener, or if you want to save some money, these headphones are a comfortable alternative to more expensive sets."
1,Disappointed!,"I had same one before and worked great for the price. So I ordered another one when mine broke. But it took FOREVER to get it this time and when finally it arrived, it was defected. I didn't bother to get it exchanged or refunded but I will not buy this again."
3,Good tool -- Bad Battery,"This is a great tool; smooth, not heavy, rugged case, good power. This does have plastic drive gears which eventually wear out but is fine the casual worker or light work. I spent 3 weekends driving 3/8 lags screws and stripped the gears. No problem getting a new drill. I have 2 other similar models but the batteries last about 2 hours with medium work load and may take 4 or more hours to cool off and take 2 hours to charge. My old model PC drill last 4 hours and charges in about 1 1/2 hours"
1,Nose Dive,"Ok, call me a glutten for punishment. I already had the 19.2 combo with 6"" saw, so I knew the batteries were junk. They burnt out b-4 they should and the charger went bad too. As far as the saw and drill, they worked well. I was going to cut my losses and throw them away. Then I saw Amazon was throwing a third free battery in with this kit, guess they knew the batteries were junk too. Well the first battery charged o.k., but then the charger malfunctioned. I like P.C., but the batteries/charger on these units are junk and I got suckered into buying it again. Amazon is replacing the charger though. I would not by this again even with 2 free batteries, buyanything else."
4,Great Professional tool,"Great tool for the pro, not for a hobbyist or casual user. Tool is heavy and has a great deal of torque. It could easily get away from an unsuspecting user.For the professional, this is a really good and reliable tool that has all the power that would want. The batteries are rapid charging and are generally available from recharge before you wear out the previous battery."
1,"Never try to buy this earphone, even it is free","Noise is big and hurts ears. I only used it a couple of times. And right now, it is already broken"
2,Could Be better,It could be better organized. Writing is boring. Anecdotes would help make it more interesting.
3,Make your own...,"First of all, you don't get the fence shown in the picture, at least I didn't. Jet say's that is a seperate option...universal fence. So what ya get is a piece of hardboard with melamine on both sides and two standard t-tracks.I bought this table to put on my Delta DP200(see review), it is meant to mount on the adjustable table and increase your work area. It is a nice thick piece of ""wood"" and the t-tracks are paralell to each other. But I could have made my own for a third of what this one cost. I have kept it and mounted it to my drill press, and made a good fence for it. I does enable me to use hold downs instead of clamps all the time. Also depending on the press you have, you have to make a cutout on the back side of the board, so your height adjusting crank will clear the table.It is well made and stout, it does the job but I was disappointed. Recommend you make your own."
2,A little disappointing...,"I was disappointed when this toy arrived. It was ""okay"" but not as sturdy as I would've liked. My boys (ages 5 and 7) had to keep rebuilding after the structure would fall over and break apart. They had played with an older version at a relative's house that was much more substantial but doesn't seem to be made anymore. It might be better for a slightly older, more patient child who will knock into it less and be less frustrated by having to rebuild."
2,not as good as other brands,"We got two marble runs for xmas this year and the Redbox was not as nice as the Creative Minds one. Redbox model wants to fall apart very quickly, and comes with really cheapo plastic marbles. The Creative Minds one came with real marbles and was quite a bit sturdier. Spend a few extra $$$ and get a better one than this."
2,marble,There are no instructions on how or different ways to put this together. It easily falls apart and is not very well made. Was not overly impressed with the toy as a whole.
2,"Fun, but a piece of crap","My mother in law bought it because it was cheap, I guess. It was fun once you got it to stay together, but that didn't last long. Really cheaply made. I would say it's worth about $10. I would never buy it."
3,Difficult to put together!,"This toy is very difficult to put together. Also, it is smaller than it appears in the picture. I thought my son would love this toy but he has hardly touched it since christmas."
3,Not for Humphrey fans.,"If you buy this because the label led you to believe that you were getting the Humphrey the Bear trash collecting song from ""In The Bag"". You are going to be disappointed. The song entitled ""The Humphrey Hop"" that is listed as being from that cartoon actually appears here as a choral piece with the same toon, but none of the same lyrics that were in the short, no vocals by Bill Thompson, the voice of The Ranger."
5,Classic Disney 5,"This is a very nice CD for my grandkids, they love to listen to it as they go to sleep, when we have sleepovers."
5,classic disney CD #5,This CD completed the set and was in the conditon stated and I am very happy and have and will buy from them again.
2,"A disappointing book, primarily based on its title","This book provides a general description of the history of photography and then goes into devices used in digital photography along with definitions of terminology that may be educational to the the total novice. It does little to relate the significance of various capabilities for producing quality pictures and the trade-offs that occur. Some of the points are well developed for the novice, whereas others are treated supeficially and assume that the reader already has familiarity with the subject (e.g. the coverage on color). It major strength is an interesting chronology of the evolution of photography to where it is today. My main concern with the book is that it is far from the 'comprehensive, step-by-step guide' that it's title claims it to be. Anyone looking for a book that helps in taking and processing digital pictures will find very little of use here."
5,Congratulations ol buddy!,"On The Wings Of A Honky Tonk Angel is one to buy. Before IKnew Better is just the begining of what is to come of Brad Martin. Those of us lucky enough to know him in high school and beyond have already known what folks are just finding out.... that Brad has an amazing way of capturing a feeling through his song writing, not to forget the great voice to convey it, such as in his song ""That's A Woman"". With his song writing partners John Ramey, Rick Williams, Mike Geiger, and Alan Laney I'm sure that this album is going to be only the begining for this bright young, talented star! Be sure to check the CD out, you will not be disappointed! Congratulations Brad, its been a long time coming!!"
5,A STAR IS BORN!,Brad Martin is simply the best male country singer I've heard in over 10 years. His songs are real and his delivery of them is powerful and original. This is only the beginning for this artist. A Star Is Born!
5,Brad Martin. Wings of a Honky Tonk Angel,"I recently bought Brad Martin's debut CD Wings of a Honky Tonk Angel, I would recommend it to everyone! There are several traditional country songs, as well as more modern country songs! It's a wonderful CD!"
3,Good but a little bit too exaggerated,"This is an average book. It offers some insights and ideas about managing your financials that can be useful only for someone that has no background in finance. Some of the solutions are unrealistic and others are not pheasible for everyone, however. The price, though, is more than reasonable. You can find solutions tailored to a number of financial problems - 569 of them. Most of them are common sense, although there are some innovative ideas in this book."
5,A well-done piece of Native American history.,"I Will Fight No More Forever is an excellent telling of the Nez Perce and their flight to escape destruction. The story shows the real maening of the Indian wars,and the real people behind the legends. A must-read for anyone interested in American history."
2,NO DIRECTIONS.,"My mother is very disgusted that she can't assemble the phone holder and can't get it on the vent. Unfortunately, I'm not there and can't help her. If you have an elderly parent who likes to read directions this may not be the combo pack for you."
2,Hands Free stopped working,"I never tried using the holder, however the hands free was used a fair amount. But it lasted only 3 months. A more rugged cable might have helped."
2,Possibly not necessary,"I considered and didn't buy this package--if you are buying the Motorola V60 phone, the version I bought came with a hands-free device--if I had known that I wouldn't have even considered the combo pack."
4,Great Book!,"This is a volume of articles about PRONASOL in Mexico. The works here attempt to provide a coherent framework to understand the program and its influence on the dynamic Mexican political system. Several chapters really stand out in this volume, particularly the overview by Cornelius, Craig, & Fox; the historical chapter by Alan Knight; the empirical chapter by Molinar & Weldon; and Dresser's chapter on legitimation. The volume's greatest contribution is its placement of PRONASOL in a more general theoretical framework that includes social policy in Mexico and throughout the developing world."
4,Good glove for BP,"Good glove for batting practice. I got them to avoid blisters that come from prolonged swinging, and they couldn't be better for that purpose. They have a lot of padding, especially at the part of the hand that has callouses, if you perform manual labor that is. They are too bulky to fit in my glove, which I planned to use the left one for. I don't use them for games, but if you are worried about sting, they prevent it. I have definitely gotten jammed with them and felt no pain whatsoever."
1,don't buy these!,"I bought this bib thinking that it would help with catching food etc when my one year old eats, but the plastic covering on the material started separating after the first HANDWASH! not even putting it in a dishwasher etc!!!! This product does not hold up....i am now looking for another pocket bib...don't waste your money!"
5,Excellent Sturdy Frame for Crafsman Table Saw and Stand,"In my small shop, space is a premium and moving a heavy table saw and stand is a nuisance. The Jet 708119 JMB-UMB-HD Universal Mobile Base is a great solution. It took five minutes to assemble and set the saw/stand onto the base. Easily moves around and the sturdy castors have suitable locks that serve my purposes perfectly. Other reviewers go into significant details on how to make it really solid on hard floors, but I didn't have that issue. The steel and welds are well done and very sturdy; 1/4"" steel, for the most part. The shipping box arrived via UPS in undamaged condition and the unit is well packed in expanded styrene foam packaging for protection. I'm very pleased."
1,always mobile,"This base would not immobilize my Super Saw for use. With all four casters locked, it still moved when I leaned on it. Also, it requires locking/unlocking each wheel independently (a pain) and it seemed no matter which way I moved the saw, one of the swivel casters was under the steel plate, requiring me to bend down and engage the butterfly lock with my hands. There is no privision for leveling/stabilizing the tool. In contrast, the Delta contractor's saw base I replaced it with has one big lever you step on, after which you can literally spin the saw around and nice big adjustable rubber feet to stabilize it. Definitely worth another $."
3,It's Okay.,"""Hellraiser"", in my opinion, is not all that great. It's definitely an enjoyable film, but not great by any means. It's got a hauntingly surreal quality to it, which makes it quite interesting to watch, as well as lots of blood and gore. The story is somewhat interesting as well. This makes it entertaining, but not anything more than that.Worth a rent."
5,Clive Barker is my co-pilot,"Watching Hellraiser again after several years, I'm so impressed with what Clive created on film. With a relatively minuscule budget, he successfully directed his own film treatment of his own book (The Hellbound Heart). This is a very intelligent (and terrifying) horror film, and it's beautiful to look at. There's an elegance to the violence and the monsters that few horror films provide.It's also great to have Clive's commentary, along with Ashley Laurence (the actress who plays the protagonist).The only warning I can think to give is that unlike many of the sequels, this film is focused mostly on Kirsty and her family rather than on ""Pinhead"" and the Cenobites. When the Cenobites do show up, they don't f*** around, which is as I think it should be."
5,Hellraiser,Clive Barker is one of my all time favorites. He has incredible mind power and dares to take you beyond the endless limits of the darker side of the human imagination. A definite horror classic. My all time fave.
5,"""Demons to some.... angels to others.""","Clive Barker delivers a completely original, horribly grotesque, charade of sadomasichism, murder, mayhem, and the utter exploration of the thin line that separates pleasure and pain. The Cenobites, especially Pinhead, have become cult icons such as Freddy Krueger or Norman Bates. Based on the novel ""The Hellbound Heart"" Hellraiser is twisted mind delving masterpiece of modern horror and a great edition to the DVD collection of aspiring genre fans. I hope someday we get to see the Nc-17 cut. Hellraiser is a great film plagued by crappy sequels. (With the exception of Part 2... it kicks ass!) Pick this little gem up today and solve the puzzle.... an eternity of pleasure and pain await."
2,Weak Film From a Gifted Writer!,"I am a huge horror movie and book fan, but ""Hellraiser"" was beyond lame. While Pinhead is a cool looking villian, he wasn't in this film more than five minutes. The acting was even below some of the worst horror films I have ever seen (Pinhead excluded of course). I liked Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart, but this movie was cheesy beyond belief. I need to watch my copy of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" again to remind myself why I love horror films so much. Stick to writing Clive!"
1,Slow and dumb,"It's freekin slow and there's nothing scary until the last 20 minutes. The daughter is the only one that can act. Half the Cenobytes are just lame. One's a fat lard that's... I guess he's supposed to look cool cause he has shades on. But that doesn't help to distract you from the 5 fat chins he has. And the shark hybrid guy. That's supposed to be scary when you chomp your teeth like a wind up pair of plastic teeth? And upside-down monster thing. Special effects have left you far behind. That we can forgive. What we can't forgive is how you fight with the girl and you manage to get her hand but somehow, with your mouth right there, you can't pull her in and get a chunk of her. Really??I just watched No Tell Motel last night and that had all sorts of people talking about how slow it was. I found it entertaining enough to want to get to the end. They would have turned this off in 10 minutes.I'm glad I didn't pay for this."
2,silly humans and some cheesy effects,"The blood is too thick and gooey, the skin with hooks in it is very obviously latex, and the Cenobite with the shades is more goofy than scary.Also, I must point out the silliness of some of these humans and of the plot elements:1. Why did the pleasantly bland fellow get remarried to such a horrible woman?2. If you see that your dad's head is bleeding for no apparent reason, wouldn't you immediately assume that something is terribly wrong?3. Who the heck moves into a house with rats and bad plumbing when they don't have to?4. Why is the word ""Cenobite"" never really explained?5. When a homeless guy comes into your place of business and starts eating bugs, wouldn't you call the police?And so on.There's such a fine line between silly and scary, isn't there?"
1,Why does everyone like this movie so much?,"I gotta tell ya, I just don't understand why most people are so enthralled with this film. For years, I listened to people telling me I *had* to see this film. Well, I did, and it's mediocre at best. Too many things happen in the film without reason. Most bothersome of them is the reanimation of Frank from his brother's blood. No explanation of how or why this might have happened, it's simply happens. I understand that this is a film dealing with a non-physical realm but really, why would the filmmaker refuse to give me some explanation as to why these things happen? Oh, and somehow, demons who seem to have a rubber fetish just don't scare me that much. All in all, the appearance of the demons seemed laughably non-frightening to me. If you haven't seen it, I'd rent it before buying it. Lots of folks swear this is a good, scary movie...I'm just not one of them."
1,Absolutely mindless gorefest.,"I say that this is pretty much an awful excuse for a horror film. You see, I typically watch movies of this genre to be scared, or intrigued by ideas. Hellraiser has ideas, but they're all botched attempts and the film is likely only to scare the squeamish or the young. Trust me, this is the sort of movie that will leave you laughing at its awful effects."
3,"Pretty good, but not the best","This WAS a great way to introduce Pinhead and the Cenobites, but the story sadly focused FAR too much on the romance between Uncle Frank and Kirsty's stepmother. However, the BIG redeeming factor is- without the first flick, you'll never understand Hellbound, which was one of the two best Hellraiser flicks."
4,Awesome - But Technical Problems With DVD!,"This movie is a KILLER (no pun intended) of a horror movie. There is no horror better - from one die hard horror fan, this is it. The movie itself was 5 stars, but getting 4 because Hellraiser I and II are the only DVDs I ever got that didnt play sound on my setup and never knew why. I had to settle with VHS :("
5,NOT WIDESCREEN!,"There's no reason to say any word about Hellraiser... Everyone who ever saw it know how fantastic this masterpiece realy is.I own the collector's Edition, and so i know it is definitifly not Widescreen. I don't know if there is an error by amazon or i get the wrong tape, but it IS labeled as the collectors edition and not widescreen."
3,HORROR IN ITS PURIST AND MOST BRUTAL FORM,perhaps the most graphic horror movie of all time with amazing but haunting speacial effects the story was quite interesting how the rotting coarpse in the attic is a womans former lover
2,Torn between okay and sucky,Very complicated flick about married woman who starts to have fantasies of a former lover who was captured by angels from hell. To make the long story short: great performances but a REALLY pitiful final product. Not scary at all! Just gross and sick. BOO and YAH!
2,"Pinhead Pinhead, quite contrary, how does your pinhead grow?","In our film history, we shall see such films that are hailed as the greatest film of all time. But this film is hardly the greatest. A girl visiting her father and stepmother stumbles upon a rubix cube that releases representatives from hell who want her stepmother's former lover back in their clutches and will excuse her from her stupidity in a business transaction. I didn't lose you, did I? Too sick to watch alone, and too sad to share the experience with friends. Settle for happy medium."
4,Cheesy at times. but scary as hell,One of my top 10 favorite horror series. Pretty disturbing stuff. still don't quite understand where the chains shoot in from (the netherworld maybe?) still worth a weekend marathon watching 1 - 4. Recommend watching with at least one other person.
4,"""We have many Pleasures to show you""",Ok I know everyone has thier own point of view on scary movies..Here's mine.Pinhead scared the living daylights out of me. Clive Barker is a master Of Horror. This Movie left me driving around after leaving the theatre trying to get my mind off of it. HA! that doesnt happen often! I am not scared easily. Worth the watch!If gore is not what you seek...this movie is not for you!
1,Latest Release = ZERO Special Features,"The most recent release of Hellraiser on Blu-Ray has NO special features. Do NOT purchase the Midnight Madness Series version. This is just another ploy to make another buck with no effort whatsoever in time for Halloween sales. I love the movie, but this is total B.S. There is no excuse to release Blu-Rays with ZERO special features, ESPECIALLY when previous versions had them."
5,One of the best,"This is a love story/horror film complete with gore, awesome evil characters (the cenobites) and an awesome soundtrack that really sets the tone for a classic horror film. It touches on infidelity, broken marriages and the price people pay for lust gone out of control. Worth it for any fan of 80's horror and in my opinion is so well done it just might appeal to people who are not fans of horror per se. Yes, the story and the atmosphere is that good."
1,Overrated.,"Clive Barker's Hellraiser is on of the most overrated movies ever. I saw this movie when I was young and did not like it, but about twelve years later I gave it a second chance. I liked it even less.A silly, foolish, sadistic movie that plays like a bad independent film. More of the blood and guts that we have all seen over and over agian but with some real sick elements thrown in.The monster Pinhead was a real good force in the movie but the other monsters are just silly looking.If he wanted to show us the horrors of hell (and why would anyone want to do that?)he ended up just grossing me out instead."
1,Pinhead for President,"This original Hellraiser was showing commercial free in HD last night for Halloween. It's one of the few well known horror movies that I had somehow missed and frankly, I'm still wondering what's to like? A magic box and strange creatures sounds like it should be a lot of fun. I enjoy horror movies with suspense and surprises. In regard to gore, I can take it or leave it. It's just that I didn't notice anything imaginative or creative, and the conclusion was quite predictable and uninspired. Maggots, rotten flesh and bones, and literally, a sadistic bloodsucker upstairs are the order of the day! I guess jealousy can be a real obstacle in achieving one's goals in life. Honestly, I was bored to death, and even Jason dressed in button-up pajamas, and ready to be tucked in, seemed like a potential oscar nomination in comparison."
1,Pure Hell,"This film, along with the others(Part 3 is the only one I can stand), are cold, lifeless pieces of tripe. There is no entertainment value in any frame of this film. Not one single enjoyable moment. Pinhead is an interesting creation, but there is not enough of him to be seen in any of the movies to make him scary or to have a lasting impact. This movie is pure slime."
3,Good,"This is a one of a kind of horror movie, it has a lot of blood and guts in it. Plus the plot(which is rare in the horror field) is pretty decent, and I suggest that people who have young childern or can't take much blood should watch this film."
4,Blu-Ray Version. VG PQ for age.,"I liked the later HellRaiser releases, but never saw the first film until now. Very Good horror movie.The Blu-Ray quality was better than I expected. The special features included HellRaiser trailers, that were not in Blu Ray, and the same scene comparison between the Blu Ray scenes and standard scenes was incredible. Dropped to 4 stars only because the Blu Ray is lesser quality than today's releases (like Dexter). Probably not a fair comparison.Story: Acting was very good, and the story, given it's unbelievable nature, was much better than most horror movies. That is, it is horrific, rather than silly. I'll purchase the sequels, when they are released in Blu Ray."
5,Redefining Horror,"Hellraiser changed the course of horror movies in the 80s, just as Japanese horror films have done recently.Before Hellraiser, horror movies had become comic-like, simplistic Goodie Vs Baddie battles (with a few exceptions e.g. David Cronenberg).Hellraiser creates its own dark world, but one that feels very realistic. The characters are unvarnished, with many clashing motivations.The effects still look good and disgusting today, apart from the dated electric animations.This film has been a big influence on my own movies. My most recent:Capitalism - The Movie, features a wink to Hellraiser, in a scene where a rubik's cube summons a demon."
5,Great Movie,"Being new to the Hellraiser movies I recently watched this. Being a huge fan of Horror movies I have to say, this movie is in the top 3 of my favorite horror movies of all time. I highly recommend it."
3,One of the Most Original Horrors,"If you haven't seen it, and you're into horror, you deserve to see it.This film has a big following because it grabs you with its story and its gore.The S&M; Demons are almost an afterthought. They're hardly necessary. The interestingthing is the dynamic between Julia and Frank. How far will she go for the man she loves?Too far.Sidebar: I would love to have seen the original British version of the film before several actors'voices were dubbed by American actors. It would be wonderful to hear Frank in his English accent."
5,Demons To Some Angels To Others,"It's hard to sum this up for anyone wanting to know more. Gernerally speaking, Hellraiser is a film beyond monsters. A film that is a metaphor of sorts of the 7 deadly sins and human desire. Mix that in with some of the most beautiful scenes of horror created and enjoyable realistic characters and you have one of the top ten most charismatic films ever made.If you love horror or want something beyond horror. Hellraiser is your answer.Should be on every horror fans top 10 list."
5,We Will Tear Your Soul Apart...,"In a place between pleasure and pain, there is sensual experience beyond limits. And in a world between paradise and purgatory, there is a horror that feeds the souls of evil. Open the Lament Configuration and release the satanic legions of the damned!For the first time ever, experience this instant classic fully remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 supervised by THX with a crisp scope at (1.85:1) enhanced for 16x9 TVs. What is your pleasure Sir? Jesus Wept..."
3,Not too much to say -- Under-welmed,"For a ""Special Edition"" it's nothing SPECIAL at all --Bought it because it was cheap --2 hours of my life I will never get back --:o("
5,the original...,"therefore the best! Pinhead gives you a scary intro into his world of hell! You will be drawn into it, until the end and then you have to buy the 2nd one! Itll keep you coming back for the scares and gore!"
3,"Kind of scary, very gory...","The original in a (so far) six-film series, this film is not a triumph in the horror movie genre, but it does have good themes as well as a menacing villain, Pinhead. It's watchable if you like this kind of stuff, but it gets a little ridiculous. Some neat-o special effects and lots of gore make this a horror fan's treat."
5,Red & Rover,"Red & Rover will bring back treasured memories of time spent with your own 4 legged friend. Red & Rover is to the love felt between ""Man"" & his true best friend as Diblert is to the business world. The stories are for all ages (0-99). Rover is a cross between lassie, snoopy, and rin-tin-tin. If you are a reader of the series you should get this book. If you have not read the series you will start reading it after reading this book and become a fan. This book provides the first meeting betweed Red and Rover. I have purchased 3 copies: one to read, one to save, and one to loan. After reading this book you will be hooked and look at your current coompanion with more understanding.My only wish is that all the strips would be published."
2,shecreature remake w/ unk show & xtra,"""critcha of destru."" -lousy movie, shecreature-much better. good things-the 1st half of song played by a band was cool. the critcha showed up only 'bout 4x's and didnt do much and got its suit damaged since it had been reused in other of lare buchanan's films. i didnt see the other movie and the xtra was just ok-different-rarely seen. not a fun set to get. and too xpensive. rt. now for 12$ total?-a total loss."
1,Not as promised,"The battery that accompanied the collar didn't work. I had to use the battery from my other dog's collar just to be sure this collar worked. It seems to. Also, I was supposed to receive both the short probes and the long probes. I only received the short probes. Not very thrilled at this point."
1,No Sound means doesnt work,"Unlike our other petsafe collar, this collar emits no sound. It looks like its supposed to. Nothing happens until the shock zaps you (or the dog). Worthless since the dog is afraid to go outside now and never gets warned about the parimeter."
1,Battery failure,"My 2 dogs have used the invisible inground fence for years without a problem (old collars). When my friends 3 dogs moved in, I bought 3 RSC UL-275BM collars. The first collar's battery failed immediately and I returned the collar. The batteries in the other 2 collars failed within 3 months - outside the Amazon return period. The collar indicates battery failure via a blinking light. I contacted petsafe who advised to reset the unit by removing the battery and draining the capacitor. Did not work. Old collars work well. I have not located any info on battery failures on these units but 3 failures is not acceptable."
5,excellent product and seller!,Received w/in specified time frame in new condition as described. Excellent seller. I would buy from this seller again. This product works great. My stubborn dog will not cross the line as long as this collar is on and in working condition. He stays about 10 feet away from it.
4,Collar color for PUL-275 In-Ground Deluxe Ultralight Collar w/ Radio Receiver,"If the color of the collar matters, this is not a true red like the picture tends to show. It is more of a rosy red which matters to my son since he has a male dog. You can buy another color collar and change the radio receiver out, but it just adds up on the cost. I wish there was more choices than one color."
5,This system has changed the quality of our dogs' lives!,I can only say that I wish that we had done this with for our deceased dog who was tied outside. How bad do we feel!! It has genuinely changed the quality of everyone's life. We can actually work outside in the yard with the dogs exercising one another! My kids can play with the dogs without being pulled by a leash. It's remarkable and I would recommend it to anyone with a dog---but I think they've got them for kitties too!
2,Similar unit RF 275,"My experience with the older model may help. It uses std 9 volt batteries Lower cost!It has been good for 3 years+ but recently started flashing after new battery insertedManual says remove battery & hold correction level set button ""until the light goes out"" There was no light so held for a few sceonds only -- no better . Petsafe tech said $40 for replacement receiver . I tried a new approach I held the correction set button for about 30 seconds even tho the light was out all the time . Installed new battery & everything works again! Typical battery life has been 6 months+ This model is still available & is a better option I think."
4,Training made simple...,I like how simple the training part of this was. My dog is quite stubborn and after being stung 3 times when he attempted to cross the flags he lost any interest in escaping to chase squirrels or rabbits. He did provide several laughs while he learned but never was harmed by the zap.
4,Great collar for mall breed,"I'm using this collar on my 14lb Yorkie, and it works great. Small enough to not be cumbersome, but fully functional. The only complaint is the red strap is cheaply made and frays easily. And the proprietary batteries can be a pain in the ...."
4,Dog Collar,I needed it to keep my dog in the yard and it was a good replacement for the older one that went out.
1,Ultra-light collar,"I bought this collar to go along with our Petsafe Stubborn dog fence and it doesn't work - our dog literally sits right on top of the inground wire. Unlike the stubborn dog collar, this one doesn't have a dial to increase the tone/shock. We're having a hard time training our dog because we can't hear the tone, so we couldn't tell when to pull the dog back - which didn't really matter, because he never got shocked anyway. I'm going to see if I can return or exchange it for another stubborn dog collar."
2,On Backorder,"This item, as of today, is still on back order with this vendor. It is NOT in stock as the page says. If you are Prime, you will be disappointed. They have no status on when they will ship. Look elsewhere."
1,NONO!,"I do not own one of these, and i would never resort to shocking my pet for any reason, nor would i suggest that anyone do this to their pet. if you feel the need to shock your pet, just to keep him in the yard, then maybe you should get a caged singing Bird."
4,What did you think 230V means?,"Unlike the other 2 reviewers, I understood what 230V means. This unit works great, and is a very affordable 220 volt back up. I've had one of these units for over 2 years, without issue. Very well built product."
1,DO NOT BUY,"PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE OR USE THIS ITEM IN THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH IT IS SOLD AND ONLY SHIPPED IN THE US. I PURCHASED THIS ITEM NOT REALIZING IT IS FOR EUROPE. PLUGGED IN MY COMPUTER TO IT AND MY COMPUTER BLEW UP. IT MADE THE LOUDEST POPPING SOUND, SPARKS FLEW AND SMOKE CAME ROLLING OUT. THIS ITEM IS NO GOOD. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE OR USE IN THE UNITED STATES."
1,Dont Buy cooks piece,"The handles will get hot even with in 10 minutes of cooking,Better use gloves if you want to use this.Dont buy... Not worth for quarter the present price!!!"
1,If you want this then you better buy gloves,I bougth this and I returned after first use. The product handle gets too hot and you could potentially burn your hand unless you have habit of cooking with gloves on hand. I would not recommend this product for its price at the expensive of burning your hand. So please be beware.
4,Great non-stick set,"I was afraid that this set wouldn't be all that great because of the price and reviews, but the non-stick surface is great on these pans! The handles get a little warm, but since they are metal you can put the set in the oven! Very perfessional. I think this is a great set for the money!"
4,History video review,The collection of music videos is good and spans a good cross section of Michael Jackson's earlier music.
5,Good DVD,I really enjoyed the dvd. It had a lot of my favorite videos on it and some I had never seen before.
3,No better than VHS,"I ranked this low due to the fact that the audio quality is NOT what you've come to expect from a DVD. Yes, the songs are great, the videos are nicely done, but, if you own the VHS version, there is no reason to ""upgrade."" As a matter of fact, Michael's CDs sound better than this. WAY better..."
5,Micheal Jackson Video,I enjoyed the video very much. It has some of favorite jackson video's on it. thanks RIP Micheal
3,"Haven't seen it -- I was looking for the CD, not DVD. oops.","I've wanted to get the CD not the DVD. Buyer's mistake. I decided to keep it because I like Michael Jackson. I'm sure this DVD will do it justice, so I decided to keep it."
5,Michael Jackson is just awesome!,Michael Jackson is and always will be the greatest there is as far as music is concerned.
3,Quality of the video is poor...,I purcahsed this as a Christmas present for my 9 year old son who has become a MJ fan. My son enjoys the video very much. I however was disappointed with the quality of the video. It is very grainy. My son does not seem to mind and practices his MJ moves daily. If you purchase this video be prepared that the quality may not be what you are accustomed to.
5,The BEST Video Hits of Michael Jacson because of Appealing Dancing + Exciting Music + Subittles + Good Video and Sound quality,"It's the BEST Video Hits of Michael JacksonThe dancing is riveting. The music is exciting. The quality of video and sound are very good. This DVD has English SUBTITLES. That's what I like the most. It enables me to sing along.I love 2 songs in this DVD. They're ""Black or White"" and ""Beat It"".It's certainly worth buying."
4,Michael Jackson Video,"I really enjoyed the video, but it took 20 days to get to me, from one state away. The shipping was very disappointing."
1,Michael Jackson - Video Greatest Hits - HIStory,Well...I'm still waiting for it. The last I heard from the company their data base had been compromised. I haven't had the time to resarch or follow up on it.Please advise. I'd appreciate your help resloving this issue.ThanksMeChelle Hamilton-Gilford
5,Great!,This was a wonderful product. It had many of the most famous music videos a great way to remember the late Michael Jackson for years to come.
5,Michael Jackson - Video Greatest Hits - HIStory on Film,"This spectacular compilation of Michael Jackson's music videos is a must-see for all MJ fans, and anyone else who enjoys good music and dancing. This tape includes the videos:-Billie Jean -The Way You Make Me Feel -Black or White* -Rock with You -Bad (shortened version without Wesley Snipes) -Thriller (entire video with credits) -Beat It -Remember the Time -Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough -Heal The WorldThis is a great video that shows not only the evolution of Michael Jackson's music, but also that of his appearance. Co-stars include Eddie Murphy, Iman, Magic Johnson, McAuley Culkin, Bart and Homer Simpson, and others. An exceptional video!!! *In the video Black or White, Michael appears to be furiously smashing the windows of a car for no reason. In the original, racist graffiti is painted on the windows. This was edited out in this version. Relax, Michael is not crazy. Or at least not that crazy."
5,Michael Jackson- Video Greatest Hits- HIStory,"I just love to watch him in most or all of his videos! When I feel down, I just need to watch and/or listen to his songs, his music, his dance! He is the only source of my inspirations as of now! He really helps me going through with my life! I don't know what else to say! Michael Jackson is LOVE!"
3,Michael Jackson DVD,The picture quality of the DVD is a little fuzzy. I am happy on how fast I got the DVD but the picture quality is off some how.
5,the best game,so much fun for the whole family and a great way to sweat and lose a few extra pound amazing game..
5,michael was a thriller,"This an excellent video dvd of Michael Jackson, as I remember him back in the 80's. What a great preformer showing all his talent in dance as well as singing. He was a legend in our times. Anyone who is a fan of his, will love and want to purchase this dvd. Not only have I watched it over and over. So have my kids and grandkids. Its a must and a keeper."
5,Great purchase & excellent condition!,This product was worth every penny and came in a timely manner in good condition. Great purchase!
5,Great DVD by the King of Pop Michael Jackson,Great collection of music videos (Short films).only wish it would be released as Blu-ray someday or a little better quality but I can't complain it looks great.
2,Great but poor,This is a great collection of Michael's music videos but the quality of the product is poor. I would love to have this in a remastered blu-ray edition. I continue to search for a better quality product.
2,Poor film and sound quality,"This video got so many great reviews, I thought it was a no-brainer to buy it. However, the video picture and sound quality sucks. It looks like a black market copy. Grainy, unclear, and sound is pretty terrible. You would assume with technology today, it would have been remastered or something to DVD, HD quality, but no. But all in all, you get MJ's great videos to watch and hear anytime you want-- if this is all that's out there. Haven't tried looking for others yet, so if anyone knows of a better one, please share!"
3,Michael Jackson's History I,"The cd was received in good timing. However, the cd looks like a copy. I thought I would get an original cd with pictures and info on Michael Jackson like most dvd's and cd's have."
4,Daughter Loves It!,"This was purchased for my six year old daughter who is one of Micheal Jackson's biggest fans. She and I love this DVD. It contains never before seen footage of some of the music videos. Of course video quality is impeccable. No more grainy you tube videos (for those songs at least). I only gave it 4 stars because the DVD omitted ""Smooth Criminal and They Don't Care About Us"". We enjoy sitting together and singing along with Micheal while he performs. She knows all the words to every song. Seriously! She knew them before I purchased the DVD. I told you that she's one of his biggest fans."
5,"History, Part 1",Bought this as a pair w/ part 2... couldn't wait for the Blu-Ray version. Both products were reasonably priced and delivered as promised.
4,Good Dvd the long movies were tight,I bought this dvd long time ago and it was great but not enough music videos i kinda suggest Number Ones dvd better thought but other than that good dvd
5,Michael Jackson ..........Videos,"I recieved this product On Time and in Perfect Condition!A ""Must Have"" for any Michael Jackson fan.Thank You Amazon!It's always a pleasure doing business with you!Neva"
2,Poor Quality,I purchased this item for my sons who have become avid Michael Jackson fans. I could not have been more dissappointed in the quality of the DVD. The sound is horrible! This was the worse than a fake copy. It honestly sounds like AM radio. Very dissappointed.
4,Essential for your collection,"Michael Jackson's HIStory is certainly an essential in your MJ collection. There is more than one history going on here. Not only do you watch his progress from phenomenal little boy to phenomenal young man, you watch the progression of his disease, vetilligo. And still he shines on. There are some things, though, that I wish had been done better. The history is not a true timeline in that the songs are not done in sequence. I also wish the songs had been printed with the counter numbers so that you could just fast forward to the video you want to watch."
4,Sicilian Dictionary and Phrasebook,"I was really surprised to find this dictionary! Have not gone completely through this handy reference book, but so far have only found one word...actually a combination word ... that I was trying to translate that was missing. The pronunciation guide is helpful, as are the common phrases. It's a little larger to carry in a purse than I'd like, but is easy to read for ""old"" eyes! The book is a great complement to several other books on Sicily that I've found."
4,Helpful little book,"This is a good book for the traveler to Sicily who doesn't want to insult the natives by speaking ""Italian"" instead of Sicilian."
2,Spike shows he's no Paddy,"Strange that Spike Lee would write an homage to Paddy Chayefsky's satirical masterpiece, but not ""get it."" He starts the film as a wonderfully bizarre fantasy like ""Network"" but then asks us to take the events seriously, forcing his actors to play heavy dramatic scenes in which they question their part in a completely unreal minstrel show. A fascinating farce degrades into embarrassing angst and finally into downright melodrama. Note to Spike: farce is meant to be fantasy, not reality."
1,"great idea, terrible movie","What a mess made of a great premise. Yes, reviving a black minstrel show is a monsterously great idea for satire; this could have been an epic moment for Spike Lee to use racist materials in order to destroy them with class, confidence and wickedly funny smarts. But no, Spike's only expression is angst and reverse racism, rolled up in a bunch of ""safe"" hammy melodrama and self-consciousness. It's not funny at all, and very boring. Worse, it all looks very amateurish, like Lee's a film student without the ability to pull all his ideas together. The film never finds a consistant tone and the end is just laughably bad. Your time is better spent reading a book about blackface or Bert Williams, or doing anything than watching this lousy dreck."
3,Great movie,"Bamboozled isn't one of spike Lee's best films but it isone of his better ones. While the jittery camera angles can be annoying, the movie hits the mark whentalking about the roles of African-Americans in the media. Lee makes it clear that African-Americans do not have a significant amount of control over their own image, and because of this whites create false pictures of black life inmedia. Strong Performances from Jada Pinkett-Smith, Tommy Davidson, Savion Glover and Damon Wayans Make up for the film's jumbled pacing and bad camera work. It's not the story that's bad in bambooozled it's the editing and camera work."
2,A Typical Spike Lee Film,"I had to watch this movie for my english class it was a typical Spike Lee Film- meant to be funny, but leading astray until his point was to make a political statement. The film went from racial satire to blatant racism. Yet another great Spike Lee film."
4,Well done,"This film makes one think about many different things. It is not Spike Lee's best film, but it certainly worth a look. The movie was well done, with many fine comic moments as well as dramatic ones. It is a bit uneven, but that shouldn't keep you from watching a film that deals with racial issues in such a way."
2,Why Spike....Why?,"One thing that Spike loves to do, is get his message across. But what he doesn't seem to understand is that is MUCH better to let people figure out the message, instead of beating us over the head with it, which this constantly does through its entirety. The Tommy Hilfiger skit was good, but a little overdone and tacky. The ending was just completely horrible, and just seems like Spike really couldn't think of a good way to end the film. And of course there is Spike Lee traditions of having characters riding on a trolley when they are supposed to be walking. Come on Spike! This was innovative when your first did, but now it's just OLD!!!! STOP!!!"
2,Self-indulgent and difficult to watch,"If you're a die-hard Spike Lee fan, then maybe you should get this. Otherwise, forget it. Damon Wayans is so bad in this movie that it makes it painful to watch at all. I found myself embarrased for both him and Spike. This movie doesn't get its message across by example or story -- characters simply hit you over the head by shouting out Spike Lee's ideas and themes in clumsy dialogue. The only good thing about the movie is that there is never a dull moment. If you can ignore Damon's forced accent and insipid delivery, you can actually be marginally entertained."
4,"Quality was good, but the movie was definitely not","The quality/packaging of the DVD was good, beside the fact that it still had the library labels on it, which is probably where amazon recieved it from. But the movie was not good. I had never seen it before, but because after purchasing ""A soliders Story"" it was recommended as a movie I would like. So I purchased it, and I was so dissatisfied by the movie. It wasnt neccessarily the content that was dissatifying, more so the quality of the picture, the producing and directing, it was just not good. There were some known actors in this movie but didn't really boost the overall performance of the movie. The price was cheap, but still wasnt worth it,atleast not to me."
4,Bamboozled,I ordered this one for a relative of mine who is a big Spike Lee fan. I kinda liked the film. but it could be somewhat offensive (imagine that)! As always I received the dvd well within the date of it's projected arrival. Amazon rocks for Christmas! I've done all my shopping with them this past holiday season and I have yet to be dissappointed.
3,Didn't play.,This DVD would not play on any DVD player or PC that I owned. Finally we figured out that I'd been sent a DVD for another region so anything I tried would not read it. I had to return it to the vendor.
3,Not What I'd Expect From Spike Lee.,With at least several known stars heading up film the movie was lackluster. I'm a big fan of Spike Lee movies but this one wasn't up to what he normally does.
1,Desperate,"Fifty years from now, movie and social historians might study this film as a time capsule of race psychopathia in the 21st century. When this movie came out, Spike Lee gleefully bragged on cable television how he wanted to ""lay it on the line"" about race relations in America. What he should have said is that ""I'm gonna make a movie where all the whites are stereotypical bigots, slobs and monsters. All the blacks will be portrayed as helpless victims who have no wills of thier own."" The only thing missing from the white characters are Ku Klux Klan signs around their necks. While Lee spends his time attacking what he perceives to be inherent racism in caucasians, he says nothing about his own obvious tendency of racially profiling the hated ethnic group. No wonder this movie bombed big-time in America. What movie goer wants to be labeled a racist monster just because their skin isn't the right hue for Spike Lee?"
1,Very racist movie from a very racist director,"Racist drivel! Plain and simple. And in answer to another reviewer, black people DO need to wake up and realize that Spike Lee is only using you and your feelings to make himself rich and enjoy himself in the world of the so-called 'white man'...."
1,sooooo poor!!!,"This is one of the movies who make me said ""this ..."" Poor movie, real bad film...Stupid story...I love Damon Wayans, but this one, I try to think that he's not Damon...by the way, Cop Land, Battlefield Earth are better movies!! this one is the most poorest movie that I never saw!! Really Sucks!!"
2,Don't buy this tool,"I like Porter Cable tools, but there's something wrong with the 19.2V batteries these otherwise well made tools use. They are very, very short lived and it's difficult to get Porter Cable to replace them under warranty. Until they improve the batteries I'd try another brand."
2,A GIANT STUMBLES!!!,"Bob Duren, NW FloridaFirst I am a die hard Porter Cable fan, they are the best hands down. I own about everything they make. I salute them for having an innovative approach to new battery technology but this ""tower cell technology"" or 19.2 volt network line is junk. They discharge too quickly and one of the two batteries included with this combo set is basically dying according to the charger diagnostics. I bought a new 19.2 battery and it also quickly discharging. I have requested two new batteries from porter-cable and will see if they stand behind their product as usual. I am a sub contractor and must mention they see serious use. All my other porter-cable tools are outstanding and I have NOT had to replace one over the years of use. This battery -19.2volt is a lemon. The saw and drill are excellent though. Wait until they correct the battery problem before buying this excellent combo. Meanwhile buy from another manufacturer. Caveat de emptor"
1,I agree with other bad reviews,"I bought the 19.2 saw/drill combo and it was a total waste of money. The tools themselves are well built and sturdy but the batteries are complete garbage.I used the 2 batteries for maybe a total of 20 hours and one battery is already defective and you get about 5 cuts out of the saw before the battery dies!I can't even use this saw.When you use the drill the battery holds up better but who cares, I am a fencing contractor and thought it would be great to have a cordless saw to cut fence boards without dragging a cord and heavy saw out on the site, with this kit I still have to, if I do a small repair it might be useful if I don't need to cut more than 5 boards. Until they replace this 19.2 battery DO NOT waste your money."
3,Lacks Power,"I have had this combo for about 2 years now, the tools have held up fine but the batteries are so so at best. I am buying a new Porter Cable hammer drill driver because it's about the same cost as replacing two batteries. Otherwise I may as well throw away the 6"" saw.Oh and did I mention the prices on these batteries are over $100.00. The batteries don't hold a charge long enough especially for the 6"" saw. I hope they improve these batteries."
2,Don't Buy The 19.2v,"I'm a Porter Cable fan. Their tools are great, but these 19.2V batteries are junk. They don't hold any energy. They weigh a ton but are weak as kittens. You can charge up a new one, out of the box, and it will be run down in 5 mins. of medium use."
5,Excellent feel and performance,"I have had this set for some time now, and I am still impressed with it. The balance and feel of both tools is great, and the power is very impressive. These are heavy duty tools and noticeably heavier than lighter duty models, so keep that in mind if weight is important to you. The battery life is far longer than any other tool I have used. The review on this product claiming short battery life must have had defective of mistreated batteries, because I have never been able to drain a battery in one hour under even the heaviest use. On the negative side, the 6 inch circular saw blades can be hard to find, and a hammerdrill option would have been nice."
5,One of there best performances....,"When I heard this CD, I was once more amazed by Queens performance. Hearing this, takes you back to 1982. If you close your eyes for minute it seems that your with them live.I trully enjoyed all there songs, but the one that got to me was "" Somebody to Love"". At the beginning of this song you can trully listen to Freddie's voice and wow what a voice he had. Also a great song was "" Love of my life "" hearing all these people sing to it.I really recommed this CD, if you don't buy you'll really miss out a a masterpiece!"
5,one of my favorites,"It's hard for me to say which live queen album is my favorite, I love wembly, live killer's is also good, but i think ""live at the bowl"" is my favorite. Freddie's voice is perfect and also are brian and roger. this could be my all time favorite live album, slightly ahead of ""wembly"" and judas priest's ""unleash in the east"""
4,The Piercing Eye of Insight,"Seldom, if ever, do I review a book. Partly because such views are highly subjective, and partly, because as a published author myself, I understand the impact such reviews can have.Paper Wraps Rock however is an exception to this rule. For this unasuming volume stands out like a lighthouse on a stormy night. It's contents will guide the reader to private thoughts and inner feelings that they perhaps never experienced before their reading of this book.Simply, but well, written, with an eye to openess and honesty, the author has captured and transmitted the essence of walking the middle path of budo. The three chapters are full of stories that will amuse and educate those who read it.I liked the book so much, I ordered a copy for each of my students for Christmas!Mike ClarkeKyoshi 7th danOkinawa Goju-ryu [Jundokan]"
2,"Not very good, but definately cheap.","I saw these headphones for $5 here on Amazon and thought I would give them a try. I wanted a pair of closed full cup headphones with a volume slider to remedy a problem with my Rio Volt SP150 (its lack of decent volume even at 40) these headphones are okay I guess, but the sound on them is crap, even if I plug them into my old CD player which has perfect high volume. These will probably make fairly good Computer headphones as PC's usually put out higher volume than CD players. I guess I'll just hafta deal with the earbuds that came with my Rio.I could've gotten the same pair of phones at Big Lots for around the same price, maybe lower, but after S&H; on these suckers its $15, I should've been smart and got the Jensen JF 20's for $19."
4,Not Bad At All For The Price,"I had to check these little guys out because I did want a full ear cap design and they were very inexpensive. Comfort-wise and price wise, I really couldn't have gone wrong. My only issue was that they had more of a midrange sound to offer; not very noticeable highs or significant lows. If you just need something to get you by, and you don't want to spend a lot, these are a great deal."
3,"Good headphones for the value, though has some problems","I don't know why people are complaining about $7 headphones. They are $7, they are probably the cheapest headphones with foam ear cushions! Anyway, these are not the best headphones when it comes to sound. One problem I've had with these headphones were VOLUME! The volume on these are extremly low even on my loudest setting on my CD player and the loudest setting on the headphones. The design was extremly comfortable. Though, for these headphones, they are perfect on a low and tight budget, but if you have a bit more cash, you may want to go look at some more expensive headphones and a better brand."
1,Horrible,"These headphones are first of all too small. If I had ears the size of a mouse I could wear them. Second the sound quality is horrible, they cannot hold bass or treble. All you hear is static, and it sounds like the music is playing from down the hall. Lastly the cord is too short and you have to strain if you are plugging them into the back of your computer. I would not recommend these, but they are cheap, really CHEAP!"
3,"A little too ""quick"" on the release","This product perfectly fit my system, going from the 4"" hose to the 4"" port on my tools. The adapter is quick and easy to install and forms a good seal.The only 4"" port on any of my tools is made of plastic. This adapter is made from a very hard plastic. While the hard plastic makes it very resilient to drops and abuse, it makes it very slick. Several times when the tool began to vibrate, the quick release, released and fell to the floor. I am going to wrap my tool's port with electrical or duct tape at the contact point to try and add some friction between the plastic on plastic connection. I think the adapter would hold better on a metal port, but I do not have any metal ports to test this theory.In all fairness to this adapter, the 4"" port on my tool is made of a very slick plastic. Wrapping the tip of the port with duct tape should eliminate any unintentional ""quick"" releases."
5,Excellant,"It is an Excellant Omlette Pan... ""Nice to have"" accessory for persons who are always in hurry for preparing food and want to utilize their time in other Productive things."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing, because I expected it to be about the relationship between George Sand and Frederic Chopin while in Majorca. However, this book has absolutely nothing to do with either Sand or Chopin. This book is entirely made up of George Sand describing the scenery, people, and foods of Majorca, and just complaining about how she hated it there. And to make it worse, there are footnotes on every page saying that Sand was totally wrong about everything she was saying. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they wanted to read up on what Majorca was like during the 1800's."
4,Funny TV series,"We began watching the Father Ted series several years ago. Every so often we go back and re-watch some episodes. It is truly hilarious, quirky humor. The star of this show died suddenly during the 3rd season, so there aren't a lot of episodes. If you like British comedies, you'll probably like this series."
4,TRUE BRITISH WIT,"Father Ted is a very well written and remarkably executed ensemble comedy. It manages to make fun of Catholic and Irish stereotypes in a funny, nonthreatening way. It is very charming too. I think that each of the episodes on this tape are solid. they are all funny in completely different ways. Father Ted manages to be relevent and funny at the same time. Very great!"
5,Parents Prefer Peaceful Piggies!,"What a lovely little book! The piggy in the book makes complicated emotions and the frustration of dealing with them quite accessible to little minds. My daughter received this book for her fourth birthday and loves it! What wonderful questions it has prompted. It has also opened the door for us to create our own meditation spot -- and, it has made her look much more positively on taking a few minutes to herself in her room to calm down when she is upset. This book gets two big thumbs up from me."
5,Good Teaching Tool,"I purchased this book to use as an addendum to a meditation and mindfulness group I facilitate for elementary school aged children at a residential treatment facility. I read the book to my group and incorporated it into a discussion about the behaviors focused upon in the book. The children were very attentive while reading them the book. They loved the whimsical illustrations that effectively illustrate the written material. The content is simple, straightforward and yet, conveys the benefits of meditation in terms that a child can easily grasp. I have purchased other books that refelct these same concepts, but feel that the content and illustrations of this one are more readily understood by children. The focus of relating to meditation practive via a ""peaceful piggy"" is intriguing to them and keeps their attention. I now intend to research the other books offered in this series to see if they would be as useful to me as this one."
3,Fine,"This book talks about the use for and benefits of meditation. It's a good basic/starter book, but because of the less popular nature of meditation (vs standard relaxation strategies like muscle relaxation, imagery), this has narrower use. My students (I work as a school psychologist) and my children have heard of (and maybe learned/practiced) relaxation exercizes but not meditation.This book is also not so much of a how-to book, although the last few pages do have some how-to exercizes. It is interesting enough, but will not be a major part of my work or home resources."
5,Great book on meditation for kids.,I bought this book for my kids after it was used in church during service. I thought it was a great way to talk to my kids more about meditation and its benefits in a very simple way.
4,Useful book,"I bought this book for two reasons: 1-to help my 8-year-old niece deal with her anger and build calming techniques and 2-to use later on for my students when she outgrows the book. As soon as the book was read, she willingly tried out some of her new calming techniques and they really worked for her. Since she was doing so well, I introduced it to my kindergarten class and it gave them a nice introduction to meditation and to teach early calming techniques as well. The story holds the children's' interest and the techniques are easily retained by the children."
4,Fun and valuable,"This book was a useful step in introducing my two year old to pairing meditation with awareness of breath. She and I have been cultivating the ability to sit still and be aware of our breathing for a while. This book helped her to see that she can use breath awareness to calm herself in a stressful situation (hearing the vacuum cleaner, having to do something she doesn't want to do, etc.).I did not give the book 5 stars because it lacks the substance to interest older readers, yet some of the concepts are a bit advanced for younger readers. By the time my daughter is old enough to be concerned about enemies, standing up to others, and accepting things as they are, she will probably be too old to relate to personified pigs."
5,"Brilliant book on meditation, suitable for 2-102 year olds!","Don't be put off by the ""piggies"" (I was, initially). This is actually a really good book on meditation. If you want to teach your young (under 8) child/ren to meditate (or understand the idea behind meditation) this is absolutely perfect. It is also a good book on meditation generally; it keeps it simple. I think even adults can learn something from this book."
5,Fun Book!,"I bought this book in hopes to get my son to calm down a bit. We've only read it once so far, but he seemed to like it."
5,Great resource!,"As a group therapist for children, I use this book often at school when introducing children to the idea behind meditation. This book really helps simplify the reasons for meditating and offers a nice hands on activity at the end of the book, that is especially useful when leading social skills or anger management lessons for children of all ages."
3,Little gem,This is a little Rilke gem if you'd like to carry his thoughts with you however I was surprised at the size and how small it is for the price.
4,Look no further!,"I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to Biotone Massage Cream. I use it for Swedish and deep tissue massages, and I have no complaints."
5,Biotone Adv Therapy Massage cream,This product is amazing for those long massages. It is non-greasy and has long lasting moisture for smooth gliding across the skin. This is like the cream the professional massage therapists use. This cream is great and I would recommend it.
4,good cream so so pump,I like the biotone lotion line... and I like the shorter tub and size of this bottle. I have not had good luck with the pump though once the lotion got down to half full. Maybe just this pump im not sure. I will give it one more shot but will look elsewhere if I have the same issue
3,Average,"It's okay, not really the best cream I've used. I mostly have to reapply a lot which can be frustrating when giving a massage. Even with deep tissue work it dries out kind of fast. I've used the Dual purpose massage cream from biotone and liked it a lot but I ordered this because I was looking for something without almond oil in it for people with nut allergies. Will keep looking."
2,"Creme is great, price not so much..",I love the creme and the smell. The price and the shape of the container not so much. It's only 16 oz and the container is a short and fat.. I have to carry it around the table with me because it doesn't fit in my handy dandy massage belt. Your better off buying 68 ounces for $46 then 16 ounces for $20. 16 ounces x 4 containers = 64 ounces for $80. Just buy the 68 ounces for $46 you wont be mad about it! Now I just have to work on not using so much at a time. I like to glide working my way into a deeper massage once the creme has been absorbed abit.
2,Disappointed,"When I bought this collection of Christmas music, I was hoping that I was getting an undiscovered gem. However, most of the songs on here seem flat. The only song I really like is David Meece's ""Almost Christmastime,"" the song I bought the album for. Even Amy Grant's contribution falls short.If you're a fan of David Meece, find a used copy. Otherwise, skip it."
4,Let it go...,To the lighthouse was my first experience in reading a stream of conciousness book. I remember that it took me several trials to go past the two first pages. I thought it was MY MIND that wondered. When I understood what it was about I became in love with Mrs. Wolf. Her style is unique and through it she unravels the deepest traits of humanity. Read and live with it!
1,awful,"Okay, I read a bunch of criticism to figure out why this book is on the list,never mind why it's so high on the list. As one would expect, the critics areawash in psychoblither. But there's one thing I didn't see, and it's theobvious one, Virginia Woolf was consumed by (...)envy. What the hell elsecould the title of the freakin' book mean?Let's parse the phrase:To: towardsthe: theLighthouse: enormous erect phallusI'm thinking you don't need a graduate degree to figure this one out.A noxious blend of James Joyce, Sigmund Freud & feminism, it's all interior monologues & mini-epiphanies. No worthwhile human being could possibly live a productive life while having these banal, self-important soliloquies running through his head--we'd still be in caves.GRADE: F"
1,Stick to Joyce,"I found this book to be virtually unreadable. Rather than offering insight into the characters, it consist of merely words with no meaning, form or function. If you want stream of conscious stick to ""Ulysees"" or work you way through ""Finnegans Wake"". When you finish Joyce, you know you have improved your insight of humanity and have been amused on the way. After reading ""To the Lighthouse"", all I did was regret the time reading it that could have been put to better purpose. When I finished this book, I had to read some Henry Miller and Louis Celine to clear my head. I put this and Henry Green's ""Loving"" together as not really books, but merely the stringing together of many words."
1,Unreadable blather,"I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times."
1,"Pure, mindless, dribble.","""To the Lighthouse"" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed. I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency. This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful. I do not recommend."
3,NEWSFLASH:,Virginia Woolf makes all the lesbians scream. This is the perfect book for you if you're a rabid feminist tree-sitter. Screams a plenty.
2,Didn't enjoy reading it,"It was a required read for my college english seminar class on modernity and modernism. This is because some of the themes and rhetorical devices correlate with modernism I guess, but I found it very boring to read. Nothing really happens in it. I don't care how well written it is, or how wel it portrays anything, there was nothing to keep my attention, and I found it hard to read without falling asleep mid page."
5,Blown away by the audio version,"This is my first full-blown experience with Virginia Woolfe. I was always a bit too impatient, skimming over paragraphs of internal dialog to get to the plot. What a difference an amazing narrator makes! Yes, it is slow going at times, but the beauty of Woolfe's sentences make the focus on every word worthwhile. Leishman treats Woolfe's words as poetry, and I started thinking of them as that. For that reason, I disagree with the reviewer counseled against ten minute spurts -- at least in the audio version, the prose seemed so rich that it was hard to absorb more than a few minutes at a time. It was only when I began to savor each paragraph on its own that I could truly enjoy this work.This book is truly profound. It has caused me to become more aware of my own inner life, and has changed the way I think about what it means to ""know"" another person. Highly, highly recommended -- and this is from someone who spends a lot of time reading trashy chick lit and thrillers!"
3,Technically tight but uninspiring,"After completing the incredible Woolf novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" I eagerly dived into ""To The Lighthouse"" expecting similar (if not greater) satisfaction. Unfortunately, from the very beginning I felt that the stream of consciousness narration betrayed itself with the excessive unrealistic ""deep"" thoughts and ponderings of the lesser characters. Sure, we all know Mr. Ramsay is a ponderous metaphysician and we expect such soul-searching from him - but from all the others as well, and at all times? Every character seems to be CONSTANTLY measuring their self worth and working out a personal philosophy while they go about their otherwise mundane daily existence. To be sure, we all have these ""moments of reflection"", but Woolf overdoes it here. I suppose the critical eminence of the book and its assured position in the canon still make it a must-read, but I would advise first time readers to reduce any high expectations concerning the novel's psychological realism."
4,A Psychological Microcosm,"Virginia Woolf's TO THE LIGHTHOUSE represents change, reactions to and theemotional turmoil it causes within the family, and when interpreted archetypally,it also tells the tale of human nature in environments that appear immutable butin reality are as ever changing as the ephemeral nature of the human soul."
2,"Revolutionary, But Too Much, Too Fast","I am aware of how important Woolf's work is in the context of early 20th century literature. I'm also aware that Woolf is someone who many respect, but whose style they may not necessarily like. I am one of those people. Woolf's experimental style--stream of consciousness--is revolutionary, coming at a time when most writers began to break free of Pre-WWI literary conventions.However, she remains, to this day, someone who is difficult to read and difficult to comprehend. Reading ""To the Lighthouse"" was relatively easy. But understanding it was not. To be more vulgar, it was so boring, I lost any sense of awareness of the story and the characters. Some say Mrs. Ramsay's thoughts were complex and ahead of her time; I say they were small and meaningless. And the men were even smaller, even more base. The experiment with the text was successful, but the story's worth can easily be debated."
4,Worth the Literary Trip,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
2,Too complicated for me,"No wonder people study this in school, it's quite hard to follow with very little storyline to follow. I can see why it is a literary classic, but certainly isn't great holiday reading."
1,Worst technical publication of a book ever,"To the Lighthouse is a 330 page book. In this edition it is 120 pages, because the print is so small you can't read it and the margins are practically nonexistent. I had to purchase another edition that I could read.As to Woolf's work itself, it is difficult to follow, although it has brilliant pieces in it."
2,I hope her other novels are better than this,"I find it hard to believe this is one of the best novels ever. Perhaps it's meaning was lost on me.. but I really did not enjoy this novel. I had to struggle to complete it. I was very dissapointed with the author and her over- monotonous, boring style. It seems that this novel could have adequatley been told as a short story and would have only lost it's monotone and repetitive nature. I kept looking for the literary genius buried deep within- but unfortunatley I never found it."
2,streaming tedium,"Just not my cup of tea. This was a selection for my book discussion group. The members of the group that enjoyed the work explained their reasons and I respect them. I don't regret having read ""To the Lighthouse."" I just didn't enjoy it. It was difficult to read with changes of point of view I didn't always follow. Maybe I'm just a Philistine, but it seemed to be more work than it was worth."
2,Someone Had Blundered...,"...when she listened to this on a car trip.I know, it's a classic, important book. It's well-written, and the narrator does a beautiful job. But I made the mistake of listening to this in my car on a long trip, and had to pull over several times because it kept putting me to sleep. I also had to keep restarting the CDs to figure out who the characters were, and never did understand why some of them were there at all.And whatever happened to the reddish-brown stocking?"
1,Can't seem to get through it.,"I can't seem to get through this book. It's so wordy ( I know - books are full of words, but this one doesn't say anything!) and the characters are so uninteresting. I never did finish it. Just didn't care what happened next."
1,"More like ""To the Outhouse""","Too much thought processing for my liking. ""Mrs. Ramsey thought..."" or ""...he thought..."" gibberish makes my head spin. Somewhere in this book, there is buried a story. It just takes too long to find it and once you do, it wasn't really worth the effort."
1,Worst novel ever!,"I chose to read this book after reading several recommendations about how it is a model for how to write & construct fiction. Au contraire, this is quite simply the worst book I have EVER read. Turgid, boring, meaningless, confusing, tedious, pointless. I want a refund on the time in my life I spent toiling through this mess."
1,"Waterily, Ghostlily","Unimaginative, angry, pleading, boring, mundane, violent, the book may capture the interior dialogue of its female characters, but being male I only know that Ms. Woolfe's male characters were utterly unconvincing. Clearly, the Ramsey's are based on her own parents; and though this was written in 1927 and she drowned herself in the River Ouse in 1941, she foreshadows her suicide on almost every other page of this book. How or why anyone would recommend it is beyond me. Better to read Proust or Faulkner or Kathy Acker.(Waterily and Ghostlily are illustrative of Woolfe's horrible diction and mindset, as are these parentheses)."
1,Very boring. Not a good choice to read. Too long.,"DO NOT CHOOSE TO READ THIS BOOK! I'VE WARNED YOU! IT READS TOO SLOWLY, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY PAGES FOR SO LITTLE THINGS HAPPENING."
2,The most overrated novel of all time? Yes,"First of all, I understand the psychology of the book and that it attempted something quite different from the conventional novel of its day (or the conventional novel of any day, for that matter). However, who could honestly say that there is something going on here that wasn't done much better by writers such as Joyce or Faulkner -- who also, by the way, generally had the courtesy and ability to include characters worthy of your attention, and a plot worth following. ""To the Light-house"" comes off as a college-lit writing exercise by a very precocious and observant writer, but one that ultimately lacks some very important abilities necessary to create top-shelf fiction."
2,Slow,"Slow isn't necessarily bad, but in this book it was. I am biased against the `consciousness' style of writing, so my perception of this book was already negative before I started reading it. The book wasn't too difficult to understand (unlike The Sound and Fury by Faulkner) but it was just plain uninteresting. William Bankes (a character in the book) said concerning literature ""let us enjoy what we do enjoy,"" and I simply did not enjoy Virginia Wolfe's book."
2,Not So Much,Life as told by a summer vacation mother in England at the turn of the 20th century. It does not resonate today.
3,Not recommended for pleasure!,"This book is boring to the maximum! All the characters seem so distant and practically the only thing we are possibly able to connect with is the damn landscape ! Although , this sort of writing is typical to our conscience: a stream that is never stagnant, it is not comprehensive when put on paper ( unless of course we note our own thoughts) I guess it shows that it is never easy to truly decipher the thoughts and reasonings of one another.Woolf is successful in portraying a character if we seperate each section of each part. when she tries to congregate 14 characters (of which 6 are the most important) she really messes up.My advice is if you have a choice-don't go for it!It just gives you headaches!! Well , for me it did!"
3,Big Bad Woolf,"Ah, ""To the Lighthouse."" I've never been a fan of it. This coming from an English major... I just don't like the stream of consciousness writing style. You know, there are many that give huge kudos to Woolf for her writing. I do enjoy her grasp on imagery and description, and she has a wonderful understanding of the human experience. This doesn't mean that the book was really all that enjoyable to me either of the two times I've read this now for classes."
2,One Long Interior Monologue Delivered By Milquetoast,"Woolf has a canny ability to explore the secret hidden motives and interior monologues of all her characters, but in this book she chooses some pretty unnoteworthy subjects. I'm not sorry that I read this book, but I really wouldn't recommend it. Though it does have its share of beautiful and insightful passages, mostly it just rambles."
2,Disclaimer: Not My Style,"There is only so much introspection and symbolism one can stand. Technically, interesting especially the treatment of passing time in the middle section (and the juxtaposition of its reality vs. perception), but these folks are more boring than my family. When something like this hits a 'Top 100' list, I just scratch my head."
2,Brilliant; not sure why I hated it so much.,"So, To The Lighthouse. It's a brilliant book, really. There are points when you're reading this book where you can step back and look at a paragraph or a passage or a chapter and say: THAT'S how a good book should be written, that's how brilliant authors do their thing.Which is why I feel guilty that I hated this book so much. It was a scant 200 pages, and it took me MONTHS to read; I hated all the characters, hated the writing style, hated everything about the book, which is weird because I completely recognize just how good of a book it was. It makes me shudder a little bit to think back on it. If I were forced to reread this book, I actually might start chewing on my wrists.So there it is. It's a great book, sure, but at the same time, it was horrible. Can't say I'd recommend it to anyone. Wish that weren't the case, but it is."
5,made me cry,"this book is a classic and should be read by all. That being said, it's not particularly easy to read, but it's magical none the less."
3,To The Lighthouse,"The annotation version is confusing, when I really only wanted the book itself on my Kindle, at first it appeared the book wasn't there, but it was but was under three different titles, so at least I got to reread it. The book is very good, I read it in college, but I just wanted to reread it again, for fun. The annotations were long and boring, not what I wanted, just to get to read the To The Lighthouse again. I skipped over most of the annotations."
5,To the Lighthouse --- brilliant,"Virginia Woolf broke ground in To the Lighthouse, keeping the narrative of the story in the strong subjective. People reach out to each other in the book with internal expression of sensitive feelings, observations, perceptions so that knowledge of the characters grows for the reader through others' thoughts. There is not the usual spoken onversation or direct action as a character is revealed. Nonetheless, the characters are drawn beautifully and come alive for the reader. This book is a treasure."
5,Simply the Best,"I have now read or listened (via audio tape) to this book five times. Each time, I have enjoyed it more, and have been enabled to look deeper into it.What I like most about this book are the interior dialogues that all the major characters - Mrs. Ramsey, Charles Ramsey, James Ramsey, Lily Briscoe, etc. - engage in. We learn about their thoughts, their reveries, their likes and dislikes, their fears and worries, their hopes, etc.In presenting these dialogues, each of these characters moves closer to all of us readers than would ever be possible if all we had were their external actions.Indeed, the external actions, which fall into two days separated by 10 years, while themselves totally engaging, become the vehicle for the even more engaging internal ""events"" which ""deliver"" all the major characters so satisfyingly.What can one say except that I join the chorus of those who believe that this might be the best modern novel ever written."
1,Not Good!!!!,"Since To the Lighthouse is the best book of the century, I thought it would be a spell-binding book, but after I read it, I found the book to be extremely pretentious."
2,Did not find it interesting,"Virginia Woolf's novel ""To the Lighthouse"" is about the inner psyche of the Ramsay family and friends as they progress over a ten year period. It is written in an stream-of-consciousness style except for an interlude between the two major time periods. I did not find this book very interesting. Although there is a lot of prose on the pages, I found that in the end I knew very little about the major characters. This book just wasn't worth the read for me.For those of you who don't like ""spoilers"" (there is one shocker at the end of the first time period), don't read the introduction by Eudora Welty found in this version. It reads like a book report and essentially summarizes the entire plot."
3,What is all the fuss about Virginia Woolf?,"I know I shouldn't judge an author based on only one of her novels, no matter how boring it may be. If I were to recommend reading this novel, it would be only to someone like myself who is just trying to get a feel for why a ""classic"" is called a ""classic"" and then try another book by the same author. I am not too sure that this novel gives the author justice. And so, if you were to read this novel, and you are like me, and were not really sure what to make of it, I would recommend reading another of the author's novels in addition to this one. I will be reading Mrs. Dalloway to see if there really is something about Virginia Woolf worth noting. This book, however, was sorta interesting, but nothing to get excited about.. why is it a classic? I have really no idea."
3,"""Light"" meaning ""not deep""","The book is a set of excerpts from private remembrances while at the Ramsays family beach house. The remembrances centre round Mrs Ramsay both while she is alive as well as after her death. There is s strong sense of melancholy about human transience set against the impassiveness of the house itself - and the lighthouse.Just as the book begins to envelope me within the small world of the Ramsays, the self-conscious cleverness disturbs the engagement. My mind receeds from the Ramsays and instead sees Virginia Woolf sitting and thinking of some phrase for readers more impressed by cleverness than simple sincerity.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book for this cleverness of language, as well as the many short sections where I was transported, iluminated, impressed and intrigued."
3,A striking read,"The epitome of subjectivity in writing. At first, this makes for a very difficult read if you're not used to this stream of consciousness style (and I was not), but by the end of the book, you may wish every novel was written in this form. I have encountered few books that have so well invited me into the minds of its characters. Truly a journey to ""the self,"" the spotlight of consciousness."
5,Love it,"it is freaking awesome. every time i put it in, its like im playing the game all over again. one winged angel is the only one that sounds kinda off because youve lost the flutes and violins but its still good. 100% worth it"
2,Manual is a joke,"I purchased this jig on Craigslist for $35. The manual is horrid, I used the manual online for the Woodstock 12"" jig. Google it, and download the PDF. After I used that manual, I made a dead on dovetail in about 5 minutes. The other gripe I have is if you set the clamps too tight, the knobs pop off and you have to reglue them. I used some irwin quick clamps to assist me. There is not a heck of a lot of science to dovetail joinery if you just understand the basic measurements which the Woodstock manual covers very well."
4,dovetail jig,"Jig is well built and works well, alittle time consuming to adjust but when set up is nice"
1,Avoid this like the plague!,"I received this as a gift for what I thought would be an ""upgrade"" from an old Craftsman dovetail jig. The Craftsman saw some heavy use. If not for the plastic construction, it would probably be still in use.I have also had several opportunities to use the Porter Cable 12"" dovetail jig with excellent results.I have over 25 years experience as a woodworker, building custom cabinets, furniture and other specialty items.The first time I attempted to work with this Dovetail jig, to add to our bedroom set of Honduran Mahogany, I was livid. The instruction manual is the most useless piece of misinformation I have ever laid my eyes on.Set your router bit 7/8"" below the base as they recommend, and see what happens. One look at the results and it is obvious that this will not produce a workable dovetail.If you have countless hours to spend trying to figure out how to make this dovetail jig work, go for it... If you want a dovetail jig that will work for YOU - look somewhere else!"
1,Dangerous instruction errors,"The set up of this jig is totally trial and error and the instruction booklet is loaded with errors. I couldn't believe you actually have to remove some parts to get at adjustments. The set up guide instructs you to do the first trial cut at a bit depth of 7/8"". This is extremely dangerous because if you are experimenting with narrow stock, the bit will dig into the metal jig. That's what happened to me, causing a brand new carbide dovetail bit to disintegrate. I'm lucky I wasn't injured. This is a dangerous item and I do not recommend it to anyone."
4,Good Product,"This product is a nice quality piece of equipment for the money. I would buy it again, and it does what it is advertised to do.I read the comments about the manual. It's not the best manual, but if you read the manual and follow the directions it's correct. The biggest problem I see from people in here and what I experienced is that you have to follow the text written directions for measuring the router base, wood, and router bit. If you follow the quick reference table, it will not be correct. It doesn't imply some of the proper math. Other than that, it's a drawer making machine!"
4,Porter-Cable 9987 19.2 - Volt Hammer Drill / Driver,"The hammer/drill is on the heavy side, but is an excellent hammer drill. I have been drilling very hard concrete with a very good non-hammer, corded, drill and it would take several minutes to complete each hole. The Porter-Cable cordless hammer drill complete a hole in seconds. Love the drill, just a little on the heavy side."
2,reserving judegment....,"Ordered this PC drill to replace my 5yr old 12volt PC drill. The 12volt was great - I'm keeping it to use around the house on small projects. Still the original batteries, etc. That PC drill was worth every penny. This new 19v however, I'm not so sure about. Yes it has great torque, I love that it has a all metal ratcheting chuck, but... the chuck on my drill seems to have an issue.Trying to get a bit or a driver in the chuck w/out wobble is a mission! I'm not acustomed to this problem. I have 3 drills and have never had this kind of problem. I'm hoping it's just a defect. The nice folks at Amazon are sending a replacement and we will see how it goes. My only fear is that this is a design issue and not a defect. If so, I'm doing what everyone else is doing these days, buying a Milwaukee. I hate to abandon PC who usually makes a great product, but I use these drills for a living and I can't afford to play games.Updates when I get the relplacement....."
2,My first problem with P.C .tools,"I own a number of P.C. tools and have generally been happy with them. I bought a 19.2 volt Drill Driver about 2 years ago and it has provided very good service. However I just bought a companion 19.2 Hammer Driver on 7/11. Well the other day with about the third or forth work day of use on it the gun started to smoke from the back and slow down. The battery heated up and it smelled like mealting plastic, so i stopped using it immediately. Guess I'll have to send it back and try again. All my other 19.2 tool work great. The Tiger saw is a work horse!Well its August of 2006 and my PC Hammer Drill torqued up in a tight spot and the trigger jammed in the ""on"" position. By the time I got it pulled out of the hole the insides burned up. I guess this was my fault but I would hope that a tool of this caliber would not fail so quickly under adverse conditions. I'm gonna buy a new one just to have the batteries. I think I will also raise the rating to Three (3) stars."
2,Be careful with this drill!,"I have had one of these drills for almost two years now. The plastic handle around the trigger flexes when you are drilling. In other words, the motor is about to snap the handle casing...this drill can only handle mild tasks."
1,Don't waste your money...,I bought this drill and the drill and saw kit. In the first year I replaced the drill/drivers three times...while under warranty. The saw worked well and the flashlight was the best part of this kit. Now it is a couple years old and the batteries are dead and at $90 each I am not replacing them. I bought Hitachi this time with a five year warranty. I wasted $600 on the Porter Cable junk. I noticed that most stores are carrying this line anymore.
5,A Workhorse,"We have been using these PC 19.2 hammer drills for building cisterns (big concrete boxes that catch & store rainwater) in Haiti for several years. We surely use them well beyond their intended capacity, we regularly drive 3/8"" lag bolts & endless numbers of 3"" wood screws. The drive in the drill holds up incredibly well, we get about 18 months out of a battery on average, I don't know how many discarges and recharges this is but we are well satisfied with the package. We try to be vigilant about completely discharging the battery before charging. We have a circular saw that uses the same power and it is very well built and very handy but it uses up a battery in short order. The chargers do charge in an hour and hold up well considering the power source we use fluctuates.We have been very happy with the performance of this product and plan to continue to use them in the future."
5,It keeps going and going and going...,I bought this drill 4 years ago and liked it so well I purchased another one!! I also bought the flashlight. Watch when replacing the battery to be sure and get the larger amp one it lasts much longer hopefully PC will follow as the rest of the manufacturers with lithium batteries.Only one drawback was the cost of replacment batteries. But I guess you get what you pay for. They truly last a long time. We use on a daily basis in the field and were completely satisified.
4,Scotch Magic Tape with Dispenser & 2 Rolls of Tape,"The Scotch Magic tape with dispenser and 2 rolls of tape was the perfect addition to my office supplies at work. This particular tape dispenser is more compact then typical dispensers, which is fine for me as it takes up less space on my desk. Although it is compact, it is still made very well and is a great value. I would've rated this product with five stars instead of four, but the dispenser that I received had some scratches on the side due to the plastic plastic packaging that it came in. Nonetheless, I would still repurchase if I needed another tape dispenser."
5,Tape dispenser,"This is a nice tape dispenser. Its small and dont take up much room on the desk. It rolls out smooth and cuts just as well. Theres not much to say about an item like this. However, it was worth the price and again the size is perfect. Nice item. Recommended."
3,A True Guilty Pleasure: Poorly Made Movie is Still Fun,"I like this film, mostly because it helps fill the void in the late 70's of martial arts flicks. The fight scenes are not very good even though you have two great martial artists in Chuck Norris and Bill Wallace; the acting sub par, even though there were talented actors like Jennifer O'Neal and Ron O'Neal; and the script is down right silly (I mean, the father of a slain son still fights for the championship the next night? This is just one problem, there are a lot more).Then with such negative reviews, why three stars - completely, because I still like watching this movie. I know it is not very good, but I still like it. Bill Wallace is actually very good in his role as the ""bad guy."" (I must admit my bias here; I grew up a big Bill Wallace fan). The plot is simple, drugs filling up the streets, cops are being killed and they turn to a karate champion for help. No surprises, no frills, but, in parts, still enjoyable."
4,Classic,"I have collected Chuck Norris movies and this is one of his best.I enjoyed this one. I feel in is in his top five,although I think Forced Vengence was better!"
4,Classic Martial Arts movie!,"I have been looking for this movie for a couple of years in video stores and retailers as Bill Wallace is a friend of mine and I wanted to see his role. I've always enjoyed Chuck Norris's movies and this was no dissapointment. Classic old style Martial Arts film, any true fan of what we do would enjoy this movie!"
3,"Coby CV175.... good, depending on what you're looking for","I was expecting much deeper bass and more of a balance between the ranges.When they say ""super bass"" they mean just a lack of treble and midranges. The sound isn't BAD, depending on what your standards, but don't be fooled by the name of the headphones or the full size appearence, they aren't the quality level I expected.On my IPOD i have the EQ set on treble booster to compensate for lack of balance.OK NOW WITH THE GOOD POINTSThese headphones CAN really supply some volume without sacrificing quality, and the bass really does stay consistent at higher volumes, if not the deepest or punchiest.Ok, so for 15$ with shipping, a bad deal? No. Worth it? Yes. But I think for 5-10 more dollars you can probably find a much better pair.overall- reccomended."
5,excellent headphones,"these are great. they do have really good bass. and i mean, the price is phenomenal. you can't beat it. buying these headphones was my first introduction to the 'coby' company; now, when i search for products, i look to see if the have something available. i just bought an mp3 player too.i like coby. if you are thinking about buying these headphones, i think you should. you won't regret it and even if you did, you're not spending as much as you would for the competitors' products"
4,Wonderful DJ sound without the Bulk...,"I'm a pro DJ, and I demand a lot... But when I'm not in the club, I usually have a pair of these on listening to what I'm going to play that night. The padding is superb for these headphones, and the earpieces rotate to fit your head. The only downside is you can hear a lot of wind if you like to ride bikes with these on."
2,It is more expensive than Kroger or Meijer,It is more expensive than Kroger or Meijer. Both Kroger and Meijer sell for $12.77.
3,Recommended by hospital,"This formula was recommended by hospital for my preemie daughter, so no choice but to use this...Seems like daughter is constipated these days... and expensive.Wish she could have other options. Costs 300 per month for formula, which is too much...Wish they sell in larger container at more reasonable price."
3,Neutral Review,"I had twin girls born at 33 weeks. They got a combo of NeoSure and pumped breastmilk during their 19 day NICU stay. When they came home, I attempted exclusively breastfeeding and while my girls gained weight, it was less than stellar and the pediatrician told me to start supplementing. Their weight gain has been fantastic and seem to be on par developmentally and size wise with their cousin that was born 4 weeks later at full term. But it's very hard on their little tummies. They both spit up pretty much after every bottle and one girl is on Prevacid for her reflux. They're still gaining weight well though, even with all of the spit ups. My pediatrician wants them on this until they're 4 months old and I'm counting the days till I can switch formula to cut back on all the spit ups!"
3,Not tested yet!,"the unit is installed but havent had a real surge to test it as yet, will update when i get a surge!"
5,Another very healing book by Madeline L'Engle,"_Certain Women_ and _A Severed Wasp_ are two of Ms. L'Engle's adult fiction books that capture the lives of born-artistic, talented souls... whether they are musicians, actors, writers, artists, etc. It helps me to understand that, even though I have some musical talent (more, perhaps than many), I do not have a musician's soul, because I do not have that hunger to create... to pursue this gift to its utmost. Ms. L'Engle's writing is wonderfully clear and descriptive... even the most horrific scenes were deftly, simply written, capturing the moment without yielding to the sordid. Also amazing is the retelling of the King David story, but from the women's point of view; I learned more about King David in this book than I *ever* learned in Sunday School!"
4,Architecturally interesting,"The structure of this book, built on the parallellism of King David's and David Wheaton's lives is fascinating, as is David Wheaton himself. The central character Emma, and her husband Nick are complex but seem to be missing some pinch of salt."
3,"Bright spots, but not perfect...","I'm not sure it counts as quality literature, and the editing could have been a little better. I actually noticed a couple of places where the wrong name was used. Maybe this was corrected in later editions. Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable read for me, and actually tossed up some new ideas for me about God and the evolution of his role in ancient Israel. The thing is, I appreciate the book for this, but I don't think that's what it was really meant to be about, and it certainly isn't the whole point of the novel. As a result, for the average reader, who probably won't appreciate the ideas in the same way I did, ""Certain Women"" would probably not be as enjoying or rewarding to read. It is heartwarming, to a certain extent, and touching in its way, but there's not really anything particularly new or revelatory about the story itself."
2,Am I missing something?,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of L'Engle's adult fiction, but I was bored to tears by this book. The plot was interesting on a purely intellecual level, and I give her credit for coming up with something orginal, but to me it read more like a study of the many wives of King David than a novel that I could relate to in any way. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and ended up having to put the book down due to extreme apathy. Perhaps there was some kind of epiphany the was waiting for me in the last half of the book, but I wouldn't bet on it. Her two novels about the life of the young woman whose mother was a famous musician were excellent, if you haven't read any of L'Engle's older ficiton I would start there."
2,More of a pad or rug than a blanket,"I ordered this to replace a large throw blanket. I unpacked it and found that it was VERY thick. Much thicker than any blanket I've ever seen before. It's thinner than a quilt but much stiffer. It is really more like a mattress pad than any type of bed covering. It also does not drape well at all because it's so stiff. I fact I had to smash it down some in order to get the laptop I'm using to lay flat.It is a LOVELY dark green, very soft, and the overall impression is one of quality. I'm going to wash it a few times and see if it relaxes some. If it doesn't frankly I have no idea what I could use it for."
5,Sevendust Tab,Great tab book easy to understand.Awesome to learn the riffs from my favorite band!This book is worth it if you wanna learn the whole album note for note.
2,Drop... Tuning,"I bought this book after buying the cd Animosity. I have liked Sevendust's music a lot, and I wanted to learn how to play it. First off, there are no chord examples in the book, so one must have an adequate knowledge of guitar chords, which I lack. But beyond that, the worst aspect of this book is the horrible tuning Sevendust uses. For example, in a song, the tuning is explained as ""guitars tuned 2 steps down from drop D tuning"" This way, the first and sixth strings are tuned down three whole steps. Tuning this way 1)is a pain ...2)makes the strings loose and floppy. Another bad point of this book is that the music is incomplete, and the transcription is not matching the recording when played in standard tuning... or something. Anyway, this book is not good for someone who just wants to play the music and not do all the work."
5,"Tales of the City set in P-Town, pre-HIV days","I first read these books back when they were first published, and still pick up extra copies whenever I chance upon them in used bookstores. Glad they have re-released them! Daniel and Clarrise are fun friends who spend a lot of time together getting into typical friend trouble. (oooh, he's cute, which one of us does he want?) Their gay man-straight woman friendship rings very true to me. The other characters in the series also are well-defined and interesting. These books hold up well as nostalgia for the fun-loving days pre-HIV and play on the party-town atmosphere of Providence Town. Fun summer reading!"
5,Good Book!,"I had to use this book when I was in Graduate school and this was the course book. I still have the first edition and looking to purchase the latest version. It was very interesting information I didnt get anywhere before. I remember in my company some very Sr. developers were working to understand how to implement machine authentication, and they were using it. Having used it before and with my course notes I helped them out. What a name for me :). I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the network security. At least it is not as ridiculously expensive as Tanenbaum books. Yes it is very mathematical but remember this is a computer science book meant for actual software engineers. People with no computer science background but working in industry might find it difficult in the beginning."
4,A good book.,This book is great. Hope the authors will plan to include wireless network security in the 3rd edition.
3,Half-decent book in Network Security,"This book is half decent, but it assumes the reader knows a little more than a novice with a good backround in networking would know. The book gives good diagrams and descriptions for some algorithms but not all."
4,Excellent Textbook,"Great book for learning cryptography, authentication, or about Internet Standards such as PKI and Kerberos. It is heavy on the math and theory aspects, the book actually includes an interesting chapter on Number Theory. The last chapter entitled Folklore is a refreshing way to cap off the book. The one catch is that there is little to no pseudo-code included with the examples, so you code junkies will have to start from scratch. Overall the author's attempt at a light approach to dense material helps ease the fact that it really is dense material. It covers the bases and has some nice extra material."
1,Embarrasing (I miss my TiVo),"I like my alarm clock better than this thing...Not well thought out, difficult to use, fast forward and rewind don't ""jump"" back to the point of pressing play (causing the viewer to miss 20 seconds of his program only to rewind to watch 10 seconds of commercial - why?), ""Series Link"" feature way too difficult to use (compared with TiVo's Season Pass), etc, etc, etc.I have been a big fan of DirecTv up to this point - Too bad they made the decision to walk away from TiVo and force this dinosaur on their customers. I hope that the HD DVR will be a quantum leap forward."
1,horrible,"This is a horrible product. We are on our third. The rewind doesn't work right. The whole system crashes often. Sometimes shows won't record. I could go on and on. I wish they would just ship me one of the old tivo's, they were so much better. It has gotten to the point where I am so annoyed about this product that I may go back to cable!"
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"I have been a loyal directv customer for 6 years and have sung their praises... until now. This box is the slowest, most frustrating, useless piece of technology ever thrust upon consumers. If it werent for my contract I'd go with comcast! They have poorly copied TIVO - and really put together something that just doesnt work. You cant flip between the two tuners, the fast forward/rewind is not easy to use, it takes multiple clicks to get to the list or guide, you cant prioritize recording easily, the season pass doesnt work, and its SLOW!!! Oh, and who thought it was a good idea to put the IR for the remote in the BACK!!! Go on ebay and buy a directv tivo unit..."
1,"Worst product/customer service, ever!",The software that runs this product is full of bugs and DirectTv does not know when the problems will be fixed. This has been going on with our service for nearly a year. Run away!
2,I really wanted to like this DVR,"But I'm sending it back to Direct TV with few regrets. Locked up often, was hard to navigate through recorded material, and to top it off when it quit receiving the international channels before the warranty was up Direct TV wanted me to pay $77 for a tech to come out and look at it. Thanks but no thanks."
1,It died and hubby is doing the happy dance.,"The Direct TV DVR died this morning. After putting up with this DVR for quite some time much to my husbands displeasure it finally died. Hubby is so happy right now as he has HATED the thing with a passion since we got it. He misses the TiVo that we use to have and loved but also died.He had bought a couple of used Direct TV TiVo's from a friend with plans on putting in a larger hard drive and getting a TiVo back up and running. Now he'll be able to do this.When you get a Direct TV DVR you don't own it, it is leased. Even though I had to pay $100 to lease it and then another $5 a month. Direct TV will only replace THEIR unit if you pay for a $70 service call and it is deemed a qualifying reason that the unit broke (whatever that might be).Do yourself a favor and buy a used Direct TV TiVo it is by far more superior."
1,One Way Out,"Do as I did. Comb the net, Ebay in particular, and snap up as many Tivo/Directv combo boxes as you can. The Tivo interface is far superior, the boxes have very few problems. And if nothing else, you can give Directv time to work out the bugs with their own DVRs."
1,This is an awful DVR,"Thank goodness we still have our TIVO machine. This one was free for being a good customer - I sure am glad I didn't pay for it, I would be righteously p----d."
1,DVR- Blah!!!!,"I upgraded to a used direct tv dvr. I've had the same problem 2x's Shows that I record get garbled and end early. Direct tv sent a repairman the first time since it was under warranty. He told me to unplug the electrical and coax lines. Worked the first time, but not now. I am not impressed!"
5,For silly fans!,"Silly Songs with Larry are just hilarious in all the Veggie Tales videos! My almost 3 year old LOVES Silly songs, they got him hooked on Veggie Tales completely and there's nothing wrong with that!This CD hasThe Water Buffalo SongThe Hairbrush SongThe Dance of the CucumberLove My LipsThe Pirates Who Don't Do AnythingThe Song of the CebuHis CheeseburgerThe Yodeling Veternarian of the AlpsEndangered LoveLarry's High Silk HatAnd Bonus Tracks...Lost PuppiesOh Santa!Do the Moo ShooSilly Song Remix MedleyI highly recommend this to anyone with toddlers and preschoolers. But my husband, our 11 year old and our ""mother's helper"" all LOVE these songs too!"
5,Exactly what I ordered,My wife wanted this for Mother's Day to remind her of the songs she listened to in the car when the kids were little. It arrived quickly and in time for her gift.
5,Veggie Tales are the best,"I love watching Veggie Tales and singing the silly songs almost as much as my son! We each have our favorite songs that we get to sing to in the car. If you love Veggie Tales silly songs, you will thoroughly enjoy this CD."
3,Insulting,It is very insulting to Ann-Margret and her longtime fans for a video company like Koch Music to misspell her name on the cover. She has been in the business for over 50 years! You would think that would be long enough for people to know how she spells her name.
3,"Good, but not Pharrell's best","It's a laid back track, not much like Frontin'. Then again, if it was much like frontin we would be saying it wasn't a new sound. He did a good job with the music and the feel is much like the CLIPSE sound. Remember 'Grindin'? Its nice to see Pharrell do something a little different, but I'm hoping the rest of the CD has more variety because this song gets old faster than you would expect a Pharrell track to do. After all, he was a T.R. protege'. I dig it, but I'm already ready for a new track.ONELUV,Jam (a.k.a. Carman)"
2,I CAN'T HAVE IT LIKE THAT,"Pharrell's lead single,""Can I have it like that"" sounds seriously flat.Not even Gwen's voice saves this single from becoming boring.Pharrell keeps repeating the chorus a million times.It sounds like Pharrell was lacking inspiration for this single.I hope he releases another single which will match or exceed the brilliance of his first 2003 single'""Frontin'""."
1,Can You Have It Like What?,This song is lame and you can't even dance to it. Very disappointing coming from Pharrell. Gwen Stefani always sounds like she has a lot of snot in her nose and she doesn't even add anything to the song. Skip at all costs.
2,Ouch!!!!!,"First let me start out by saying that these headphones sound excellent for the price I dont think I've heard better in this price range, Great bass and you can hear everything clear.Now on the the bad news, I bought these phones before a long roadtrip, I listened to them for about 2 hours and when I took them off I screamed in pain. Why? Well the phones were nice enough to dig into my ears and they were sooo red, they didn't stop hurting for like a half-hour.GREAT SOUND BUT THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HEADPHONES EVER MADE!!!!"
3,Decent sound; hurt my ears,"Got these headphones at a music store for about 25$..These sound pretty good (though I have a pair of Sony wraparounds that I got ten dollars cheaper that are definitely comparable), but after a little while of wearing them they REALLY start to hurt your ears. Not sharp pain, but it's this dull ache that really gets annoying. It ruins the experience a bit."
2,"Flimsy construction, not rugged, average sound quality","These headphones are ok, but nothing real special when you compare them to others in their price range.The main issue is that the curved headband is made out of very cheap, flimsy plastic. On my set, the headband broke after 3 months of use and rendered the headphones pretty much useless since the ear cups will not longer snugly fit on the ears.The sound quality is decent, but nothing that would really make you go WOW!So, the low rating is mainly for the flimsy construction."
1,Totally useless Too Too loud,These are 100% useless headpohone. They are too loud. I have to buy another headpohne Either Sony MDR-v150 or Sennheiser HD 202 Closed Headphones. Save your $15 by not buying this crap.
5,Great deal and a steal!,"This one is exactly what I look for. I need a 230 Volts APC for my overseas office and this one just fits well as I could hardly find this voltage in any US stores. As businesses are going global and people are traveling overseas frequently, i would recommend companies making more ""Universal"" voltage devices. Sorry for those who bought it wrong for US use, but it is a steal for me!!"
1,"EI means 220V, will not work in the US","I know this is a good product, we have many in our office. However, this is a little ridiculous as it will only run on 220V. This product has been a complete waste of my time!"
3,A beautifully illustrated book!,"Although I usually love Ms. Ryland's work (this is the 5th book by the author I have) and the illustrations are warm, colorful, and inspiring, I felt the story to be not very easy for children to understand and not as particularly uplifting as some of her other works. I was a little disappointed but will continue to read it to my children as they age and see if they catch on."
3,Love the illustrations!,"We are old friends of Cynthia Rylant's work -- her ""Henry and Mudge"" early readers left us in stitches, and we all love ""Poppleton.""""Scarecrow,"" while beautiful, is not much of a story. Just watching the seasons change. There's a place for watching the seasons change, but it seems a shame to use illustrations as high-quality as these to illustrate... not much action. It's a peaceful story, but it seems like a missed opportunity."
3,Interesting story,"If you're an Alain Delon, Senta Berger or Julian Duvivier fan, then you should give this movie a chance. The story is quite interesting, although the DVD is a let down. Picture quality is poor and the actors' spoken English were dubbed English, but Delon seemed to use his own voice, so I was not thaaat sad. If you understand French, better get the French version."
2,What were they thinking?,"As usual, the hype was bigger and better than the actual product. The commentary left me wondering if maybe the narrator was having a slow day. The collection of 8mm and 16mm shorts were a breath of fresh air but the soundtrack had me looking to see if the dog made a mess somewhere. This is the same company that gave you ""Betty in Bondage"". I am gald to have this collection all on one disk however, I will watch this with the audio off and my own music playing in the background. This collection had the potential to be something of value. Instead they took the easy way out."
2,Why is this Rated X it should be Rated F,"This failed, if you are a Bettie fan as I am, you will be very disappointed. Soot they didn't even spell her name correctly. A few shorts that have been seen elsewhere on other collections, there's nothing new here, boring and overall a waste of time and money. I'm guess this a a public domain collection and they spelled her name wrong because ""Bettie Page"" is trademarked. And why is this Rated X must be to entice sales because there is nothing X on the DVD that I saw, PG maybe ... maybe."
5,THE BEST TOOLS I HAVE EVER USED,UNLIKE DEWALT THE TOOLS ARE THE MOST POWERFUL ON THE MARKET AND MAYBE THE BATTERY DOESN'T LAST BUT AT LEAST IS CUTS THROUGH ANYTHING THE TIGER SAW IS THE FASTEST RECIPRICATING SAW IN THE WORLD INCLUDING THE CORDED ONES. THE DRILL WITH ITS HAMMER CRUSHES AND DRILLS WITH EASE. ONE POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE DEWALT DOES MAKE BETTER RECIPICATING BLADES THAN PORTER AND FOR THE CIRCULAR SAW USE ONLY THE BEST DEABLO BLADES FROM ANY HOME INPROVEMENT STORE.THE BATTERY BUTTONS DONT GET STUCK OR BROKENT LIKE DEWALTS BUT DO TAKE A SHORT WHILE TO GET USED TO. IT IS AND AWSOME TOOL THAT IS WHY IT IS USED IN THE NEW YANKEE WORKSHOP AND MY CABNINTRY AND FURNITURE MAKING.
4,A good classic French novel,"Stendhal narrates Fabrice del Dongo's story with a light touch, though his destiny is dramatic. It provides the reader with a good inside of 19 Century Italy. A very enjoyable novel."
3,Not a Chance is a treat.,"For those who do not care for ordinary fiction short stories, Jessica Treat's 'Not a Chance' is the book to get. The protagonists take you on a long and surreal trip through their lives as well as the people that surround them. In 'Walking' and 'Honda', the reader is confonted with the line thin between reality and fiction. In every story, Treat perfectly executes the confusion and complexity of life through her somewhat deranged narrators. As unreliable as some of Treat's protagonists, 'Not a Chance' is simply a great read."
3,More style than substance,"I bought this on the basis of the reviews. I thought the book was pretty good, but the content was not as comprehensive or helpful as I thought it should be."
1,What a waste of time,These oversimplified notes are truly abhorrent and inaccurate. Why not relax with a paperback edition of the true Lord of the Rings?
2,"Not enough detail, compared to the books.","""Cliffsnotes the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit"" condensed the first book in the series tremendously! I am only rating the CliffsNotes for Book 1, as that is the only book I have read in the series. The notes are very general and skip over some events, so it's wise to read this after you have read ""The Fellowship of The Ring."" As always, read the CliffsNotes AFTER you have read ""The Fellowship of The Ring."" I do not recommend."
3,"The book was good, but very hard to understand","The book was very short. It was hard to understand and was not shipped correctly. Also, the cover picture should be changed."
1,The whole concept is disgusting!,"The whole concept is disgusting! The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings are books meant to be read with love, joy and wonderment, NOT turned into texts to be read as exercises in drudgery and compulsion. It makes me furious that idiots and barbarians should so turn these books into texts and so kill children's love for them. It does not matter if they are accurate or not, they are WRONG!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"IT WAS AWESOME, AS ARE ALL OF HIS BOOKS. I WISH THERE WERE MORE. I CAN UNDERSTANDING WHY IT WAS MADE INTO A MOVIE."
5,A book that is one in a million!,"This is the best book John Grisham has written yet and I am a BIG fan. The Brief, written by a law student got her into a whole lot of trouble. Yet the FBI didn't even take it seriosly when her lover was blown up. Like I said in the beginning, this is one book you just have to read!"
5,The Best Book I Have Read To Date !!!!!!,"This is suspense and mystery at it's best. The book is about a young law student named Darby who writes a brief about the assasination of two supreme court justices: Jensen and Rosenberg. Her boyfriend hands the brief to the FBI and it is also passed to the White House and the CIA. Then her boyfriend is killed in a car bomb intended for her. Then she is persued by her boyfriends killers because her brief which was described as a "" shot in the dark"" has got someone in the Government very upset and nervous. This is a great book and the movie is excellent also. It sticks surprisingly close to the book too. But read the book first."
1,A Bunch Of Disgusting Chauvanists Play At Politics,"Yuck, this book was horrid. Every character was either bland or just jaggedly putrid or both. The idea behind the book is actually interesting, but the idiotic prose and 2-D, grotesque characterization deflates one's interest in a big hurry. It's too late for me....SAVE YOURSELF!!"
1,UCONSTITUTIONAL,Since when are people like John Grisham allowed to torture the public with books like the Pelican Brief?
2,Avoid the book and movie,"No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself."
3,"""The Pelican Brief"" - HARDLY BELIEVABLE!!!","""The Pelican Brief"" is an interesting novel. There are many subjects and the connections between them are shown very well at the end of it. But it`s hardly believable. I could not imagine that one brief evokes so heavy reactions at the high powers (White House, FBI and CIA)!!!"
3,Quite O.K.,"The book itself is well written. But Grisham introduced far too many characters and it is difficult to keep track of who is who. Also it is impossible that a young law student could write a file about the corruption in the white house, the FBI and CIA and that she and the Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham could uncover these corruption. It was not the best of Grisham book I've read, but it is exciting and interesting in reading!"
3,A far fetched story...,"A young law student proposes a theory on a supreme court's judge murder. When this theory proves to be too close to the thruth, her life is in danger.The thought that only a young law student, brilliant as she might be, would come up with the right theory for these assasinations makes me happy this is only a story... I'd still like to believe that the FBI, CIA and other bodies who are supposed to handle these situations are far more compentent than pictured in this book... Sadly enough, most of them believe they aren't, especially after watching 'The X Files'."
1,not so good,"I never really got taken in by this story. It took 2/3 of the book to really get down to what the pelican brief was. Then the last 1/3 was like watching a car chase. The ending was fluffy, I was expecting an exciting twist that might make the whole book worth reading, but didn't get one. Left disappointed."
1,Disapointed,I purchased this book thinking it was new from your discription. You did not indicate that this was a re-run of a book that came out in 1992. The story is good and well written but I had already read it when it was really new. This type of deceptive advertising is not worthy of you.
1,"did not buy this item, do not know why it is in my review list","did not buy this item, do not know why it is in my review list"
5,The Pelican Brief,"I actually found this book very intriguing because of it's witty dialect and the author's acutley sharp descriptive gift. I give it three thumbs up but since I only have two, we can imagine the third one. Thank you."
1,This Could Have Been A Lot Better,I have heard of many of books by this author as being great but this book was kind of discouraging. I read the book for a 7th grade English assignment and I realize that there were a lot of better books around that I could have read. Fortunatly I got the book from the library (eventually getting a $3 fine for it being overdue) and am glad I did not waste $6 to buy it!
5,reading this book made my knees wobble,"John Grisham is surely a genius! Poor Darby, killing her lover, because of a silly brief that was surely meant to go in the trash. I have read all of his books including Street Lawyer and Pelican Brief is most definitly my favourite book. Truly suspensful; yes it was unrealistic for her to outrun Khamel, government etc but who wants to read about Darby blowing up with her lover Callahan? At the beginning of the novel, what excitement is that? I'd rather read a biography on Little Red Riding Hood! I found the danger, and ducking behind the shadows to be absolutely inticing.I think the character's are exciting, especially well Darby, and Khamel I was quite intrigued with as well. When Grisham writes I see what he writes, and then I watch the movie to see how close I was for fun, im a visual person so I really enjoy Grishams writing style."
2,Pelican Brief,"I gave this book 2 stars not because I didn't like the book, but because of the seller. The book was not signed as stated in the description. I also paid more than an unsigned copy would have cost."
5,the pelican brief,This was a very good book. I had seen the movie many times and the book was very close to the movie. Thanks for an awesome story.
4,Good light reading,"I actually enjoyed ""The Pelican Brief"" more than I did ""The Firm."" I realize I'm probably among the minority here; I just found ""Pelican"" to be a more gripping story and the endings of chapters to leave me wanting to read on. Perhaps this is because I avoided the movie version, which was a disappointment with ""The Firm."" I'm not sure -- but I would recommend ""Pelican"" for those who already like Grisham."
3,You'll forget most of it before you're done...,"A quick, enjoyable read that tells us almost nothing about anything in the book. It is a plot (a discovery of a motive for the death of two supreme court justices) that Grisham struggled to find characters for.Oh well... I wish I wrote enough books to have a few panned by the critics..."
5,Brilliant...What More ? 6 stars ?,"If you have seen ""The Net"", this is very similar. Now the Net was a brilliant film. The novelization of ""THE Pelican Brief (which was even better) is even better than the film. NOw imagine..and read the book !"
3,A good read for Grisham fans,"For Grisham fans, this should be a good read. Plot twists(of course) and a sexy female lead character make it a good addition to the bookshelf. For me, however, it went by like a piece of juicy fruit gum-it tasted good but there was not much to remember after I spit it out. It's clear Grisham harkened back to his college days as the book has a lot of law school type memories. I'd like to see grisham write about a topic other than law and clancy something other than the military. but, buy pelican brief, at this price how can you resist?"
4,GREAT READ!,It was a great book filled with a lot of suspense and action. I found I couldn't put it down.
3,Hmmmmmm,"I don't really know why this book got so acclaimed as it did. It is nowhere near the GOOD stuff Grisham writes. Everyone must have his/her ups and downs..perfectly understandable. With this book, I think Grisham was having a bad hair day... Nowhere near ""The Chamber""!"
4,"A solid, page-turning effort. Grisham does it again!","John Grisham's Pelican Brief is a very well-written, nicely detailed account of a young woman who stumbles across the truth, and unwittingly puts herself into a life-or-death situation. On the minues side, the plot is very predictable, and I could have predicted the ending about half way through the book. However, Grisham throws in a few curveballs on the way to the cliche'd ending, making this among the best books I have read to date."
5,I love John Grisham books!,This was one of the ones that I couldn't put down. It's way more suspenseful than the movie!
2,Typical Grisham,"Good character development and a good story give it 2 stars. What I didn't like: too political: right wing conspiracy big oil vs environment. Then the ending: had to escape...CIA/FBI helped her, but no detail as to HOW SHE ACTUALLY ESCAPED! Then her idea of staying alive was the same as the guy from the firm: hide in the Carribean Islands and hope they don't find you. Come on, give me a break!! I may never read another Grisham novel again..."
1,Gibberish,"Worse than simply being a 'by-the-numbers' book, it introduces numerous characters that pose a threat to the cookie-cutter heroine, only to leave them as dangling plot threads with no resolution. Grisham generally shows strong promise in the first third, then falls apart, leaving me frustrated as a reader"
3,not grisham's best,"i don't regard this as grisham's best novel, as it is a bit weak both in content and in narration.the pace is fast, but i won't consider them exciting enough... the usual stuff, like killers, sleazy reporters, innocent protagonists, dirty politicians etcetc. they are somewhat expected. and i'm espcially not happy with the ending, for the final romance is utterly unconvincing.i am also disappointed at the characterisation. Darby Shaw lacks depth, and has the character of the average heroine.if you want grisham's best in words (not movies), go for THE CLIENT, THE RAINMAKER or THE FIRM. they're all my favourite."
3,Entertaining,"While the book entertained me, it is certainily not a book for Republicans. Grisham is definately a democrat and some of his stereotypes can be offensive. Besides that, it is certainly an entertaining and often gripping read."
2,Please!!!,"I read this book a few years ago. Girl's boyfriend is blown up in a car, mouring period lasts about an hour. Half the book is spent trying to find out what department the lawyer who they're looking for works in. Wow gas and oil dept! It would take a second grader about ten seconds to figure that one out. What is it with Grisham novels? Or should I say McNovels?"
4,"Good, but not his best","Not my favorite Grisham novel but still a pretty decent book and definately a page turner.I get a good chuckle reading some of these reviews that state, ""I am a lawyer and Grisham doesn't know what he is talking about!"" or ""A story like this could never happen!"". Those folks probably zigged when they should have zagged to get to the NON-FICTION section. I read Grisham's novels because they are enjoyable and are pretty easy to follow. I can't wait for these same people to ridicule Steven King. ""There is NO WAY a person can start fires with their mind!"" or ""I am a mechanic and I know for sure that Cars don't have minds of their own!""Give the guy a break....sheesh"
3,Would You Like That To Go?,"Well its another McBook from the burn and turn factory know as Grisham Inc. I am convinced he has a group of Santa's elf's slaving away in some South Carolina sweat shop turning these screen plays - sorry, I mean books out. If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get. An easy to read and understandable book that is as light as cotton candy. I actually think the movie was better. Why do I read his books, for the same reason I eat junk food, it is easy to get, fast and not complicated. Sometimes you just need a little light reading to take the stress from the day and his books fit that bill."
4,It's worth a read,"Definitely a page turner, keeps you hooked for most of the book. There are some boring parts where Grisham gets to ""legal"", but its these parts that makes the story real. I'd recommend this book to anyone, its worth the 9 dollars you spend."
3,Surprisingly not terrible,"I needed a book, and this was at hand. I kind of groaned, because I find Grisham very uneven in the quality department. But, you know, for 2/3 of Pelican, I was actively engaged, even though I had to suspend belief at some of the ridiculous coincidences. And even though toward the end, I felt impatient for it to get wrapped up, I'm still left with an overall feeling of being entertained.I do think it would have been a stronger book if Grisham would have just let Darby do her thing without injecting a lackluster romance between her and Grantham. Zero spark there, and it added nothing to the story.Also, Grisham seems to have this foggy sort of 1970s mind-set when it comes to his treatment of people of color. In this book, for example, the only two black characters are a janitor and a cop. Then there's ""Khamel,"" the middle-eastern assassin. Khamel? Jeez.This review reads like a 2, but as the book did keep me entertained for much of its course, I'm giving it a 3."
3,A DISSAPOINTINHLY AVERAGE READ,"Yes, it's a page turner, and yes, there is some action, but this book is basically written in the same mold as The Firm. The main character is not very likeable and the story line is predictable and weak. And the ending is terrible. I enjoyed parts of the book and there were sufficient surprises. The author is undoubtedly an expert at crime novels but the problem is that the book offers nothing new. An enjoyable romp, just don't expect any thing out of the ordinary."
3,rather watch the movie,"This was a SERIOUS law thriller. And I'm not to much of a huge person with law. I enjoyed being chased down the New Orleans streets with Darby. And that Darby, was a very sexy down to earth, law student and might I add very strong and intelligent.Darby made the story what it is. Without her as a character this book may not have suriviedrather watch the movie..."
1,A story swampier than the landscape...,Big oil as a villian: what a concept! Corrupt politicians: that's fresh! Reporters sleeping with their sources: that's news to me! A college woman outsmarting hired CIA assassins: astounding considering whats-her-name (another one of Grisham's memorable characters) didn't seem capable of grasping the concept of birth control. The assassins deserve to die. The only believeable part was someone wanting to kill Supreme Court Justices
2,Warning! Grisham Cheats in this one,"Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story. We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.John Grisham cheats us out of that fun. The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings? That's bad.Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules."
3,POV WRITING LESSON,I doubt the editorial comment that Grisham wrote Pelican Brief for the movie. The book allows the white Gray Grantham to end up in Darby Shaw's sack. The misogamist movie downplays any final romance between the interracial couple. Such is life in America in the `90's.In this story Grisham provides a primer for using the omniscient point of view. Out of a hundred scenes he gives Darby Shaw or Gray Grantham half of them and spreads the other fifty scenes rather equally amongst the minor characters. I think he had the reader hooked well enough that he could have thrown in more exposition. He drove along that fine line between keeping the reader in suspense and keeping them in the dark. He avoided the opportunity to educate so he could entertain.
1,Grisham Stinks,"I've read two-and-a-half John Grisham books. He is the hack of hacks. Not only are his books filled with many hole, his characters are flat and plot lines totally STINK. I've read more interesting stuff on cereal boxes.He's as bad as Tom Clancy."
4,One of the his greatest books ever!!,"This book is great. It keeps who on the edge of your seat waiting for more. John Grisham is an excellent writer. If you liked this book, make sure to try his others."
3,Not his best,"Having read ""A Time To Kill"" and ""The Runaway Jury"", I was disappointed with this novel. Yes, it held my attention, but loosely. The intrigue was decent but what made it so unbelievable is how Darby outwitted hardened,world-renowned criminals, the FBI, and CIA----absolute fantasy!Does not come close to as good as a story as his other two novels I mentioned."
1,A Flop,Loved THE FIRM. I gave it 5 stars. But then I read his next book THE PELICAN BRIEF and found it to be a flop. I gave it one star.
2,no signage,I was not signed except by someone who previously owned the book -and that someone was not John Grisham!!!!
2,Not As Good As Other Grisham Books,"I like Grisham but this book did not have as much to offer as other Grisham books. It started off with a bang (literally) and I thought I was in for a great read, however, the pace quickly slowed. There were just too many good guys and bad guys (call me stupid but I never have figured out Verheek) and Darby Shaw was the most incredibly stupid person on the face of the earth. I would recommend Grisham's other books over this one. The Firm, The Jury, The Client, The Chamber, The Partner all have a lot more to offer."
1,The dumbing of America,Let's see for 3/4's of the book our characters search feverishly to determine what department of the law firm did the dead lawyer work for? Eureka! It's the oil and exploration department. How this author has become so famous is beyond me. They use to say the NY Times was written at an eighth grade reading level. Grisham's books are closer to the kindergarten levels.
5,The Pelican Brief,"The book, The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, arrived in a timely manner. In mint condition and good mail packaging. Thank you, greenlawnvideo and Amazon.com!"
5,Spellbinding,"I read the book and then watched the movie. I enjoyed both very much, but I think the book is better. I really like the way John Grisham writes."
3,Suspenseful.,"Besides The King of Torts and The Runaway Jury, this is one of my favorite Grisham books. I just think that this one could have been a bit shorter. There was a lot of unnecessary information that could have been left out. It was a great book nonetheless. After three judges are murdered, a young female law student writes a short brief suggesting who committed the murders and why. The brief is passed around to too many people and now some of those people want her dead."
3,An average book,"It's a good book on main battle tanks, but the title has nothing to do to what's inside.Actually there is only main battle tanks, and not even one support vehicle described inside.Each entry is accompanied by some black&white pics and front/side views(don't know where the top one has gone).There is only an overview of each tank's capabilties and a long list of all the variants.It kind of ressemble the Jane's recognition guide but lacks all other armoured fighting vehicles.A good book, but certainly not a bible on the subject."
5,The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit,"I loved reading ""The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit"" to my children 30 years ago and now often use it as a baby or early birthday gift. It is the Beatix Potter book with the very fewest words per page. Children are introduced to Ms. Potter's wonderful use of the English language at an age in which their attention span is SHORT! The pages turn quickly for earliest listening experiences for toddlers. Some may object to the hunter and gun references in the story, but all is well in the end, and the little ones in my experience have loved this beautiful book."
4,"Good Bunny, Bad Bunny","This is a fully illustrated short story book about a couple of a rabbits, one good and one a nasty one who bullies the good rabbit. The bad rabbit attacks the Good rabbit and steals his carrot. In turn, the fierce rabbit ended up with losing tails and whiskers when a hunter approached him.Though short, it's a good book for young kids, equip with moral nurturing story and a fully illustrated pages to company the story. Most kids would love this book, but personally when I was one, I love a bit more longer of a story than this one."
5,the fierce bad reader,"i am a big fan of the fierce bad rabbit, as well as all of beatrix potters works. However, the main characters are better, ( i'm very fond of bunnies) and the outcome and plot are less distrubing than the whole rolly-polly pudding thing, and the patty-pan. Still, one must wonder what social allagorie does ""the man with the gun afford"". Buy this book, get the whole series, they really are very nice to read, and if you think it would be detrimental to your maturity, buy it for a younger sibling, nephew, niece, cousin, etc. and see if you can bring yourself to give it away. I bet you won't be able to, and if you can, than there is something big wrong with your head..."
2,Build one,"...I think Delta gave this item to a rookie to design, and I'll bet they didn't give it to a woodworker to test. Nothing about the left/right movement makes sense. It's either too far from the blade, or the workpiece is sitting on the metal base of the tool. The part that holds the workpiece is fine, so if you buy this thing, figure on redesigning the base, and attaching it to a better miter bar. The bar that comes with it doesn't have slop adjustment. ..."
2,Roughly Made Jig,"I bought this after using the older model and was very disappointed in the quality of the castings and the hardware. The old one, which is still available at a lower price, is a better made piece of equipment. The ""deluxe"" version is sloppier in its movements and reminds me of the junk we used to see out of China several years ago. Of course the simple operations required of this jig may not require it to be sophisticated but its still disapointing. I sent it back and bought the cheaper one from Delta which works great and I like the handle placement better."
2,Engineer/Woodworker,"I purchased this jig despite the negative reviews published on Amazon.com. The fine woodworking magazine recently rated this jig as the best overall value. The jig is made in China, and the casting meets all expectations of an inferior casting. If you buy this product be prepared to tap all of the screw holes, otherwise it cannot be assembled. It is too bad that Delta management is moving production to low cost countries. It's time for me to fine a new reputable manufacturer of woodworking tools."
4,Good once setup,"My first attempt to use the Delta 34-184 tenoning jig, after I had cleaned all the preservative off and assembled it, were less then awe-inspiring. While not complicated this jig has a slight learning curve and every time I use it, the results get more predictable and more accurate. Previously, I cut all tenons either by hand or using the bandsaw or the dado blade on my table saw. But with a little practice, I think this jig will be the go to method for tenons, as well as lap and bridal joints. If you use a lot of mortise and tenon joints, as I do, then this jig is well worth your time and money."
4,Great tenons the fist time.,This machine works as advertised. It cuts clean concise tenons that are 100% repeatable. It is massive and just plows the material through the saw blade.Set up took a while but that was me being overly careful. Great tool.This is the better of the two you can get from Delta. My review of the other jig was meant to be for this one. The other is lower priced but not nearly as accurate as this one.Sorry for the mix up!
5,Great jig,"Great jig and great price. Well made and I am satisfied with the tenons that it makes, This jig really makes it easy to get precise tenons without much work."
1,Delta this is very poor quality,"Delta should be embarassed with this item compared to the company that made my Unisaw. Oh I forot Black and Decker ownes them now. The old heavy Delta jig was one of the best and now the 34-183 then 34-184 ; keeps getting worse. I also have a deta grinder and drill press, which I like so I am not a delta basher.This may be the worst item Delta makes,in quality and design as other have noted. The metal of the screws and plastic handles look like something on a $10 jig.Buy the Grizzly."
1,Still NOT Ready for Prime Time,"The only good thing I can say about this jig is that I bought it from Amazon and they took it back and paid for shipping. None of the problems in the previous negative reviews have been addressed.The screws are still weak and line up poorly with their holes. The jig won't square to the saw blade---the recommended squaring method is to loosen the mitre guide screws and retighten. But the jig is too far out of square for that to work. The paint is still dorky. And the product description implies the work plate tilts to 45 degrees. No. It tilts to 78 degrees only.My previous tenonning jig from Grizzley was lost in a move. It had better fit, finish and function at 1/3rd the price. Buy the Grizzley over the Delta."
4,SIGMA BC506 5-Function Wired Bike Speedometer,"I just recently purchased the meter and put it on my motorized bike. Some of the meters that I looked at had too many functions or too many that I wasn't interested in. Five is manageable. I'm mainly interested in the time of day, speed, trip and total miles. I mounted it very close to the center of my handlebars so that I could look at it with little head or eye movement. The type font is large enough for me to see easily. Probably the only negative comment that I have is that the instructions weren't easy to understand. I like easy because I don't want to spend a lot of time figuring it out."
2,Not able to track speed,"Not sure if this is an issue with the unit, or the installation or if this doesn't work my roadbike. I believe I did the installation correct inline with the instructions. However, other time, none of the other functions are working well. It looks the magnet is not sensing either it is not good or the gap is too big because of the size of the wheel. If you know the answer, please let me know."
2,magnet fell off,"I just got one of these, and right away had a bad feeling. I didn't get everything it said I would in the manual. I have bladed spokes and there was supposed to be a 'pad' but none came. The buttons didn't have a very good feel to them, like I could push them and nothing would happen. Then when I tried to install the magnet, it didn't attach securely enough. I waited and got someone to help me, but the problem wasn't me, it was the way the magnet was designed. If we tightened it to stay on my spoke, the nut just got pushed out and fell on the floor. So we put it on as securely as it would go, I rode once with it and it worked, but the second time I used it, the magnet fell off and got lost. I think there is a problem with the buttons too, they don't always seem to work, although I didn't get a chance to use it enough to be sure if maybe it was just me getting mixed up. I'm hoping to be able to return the computer and exchange it for a different model."
2,Magnet/Pickup gap way too small,"This is a nice little computer but the less than 5 mm gap required between the magnet and pickup is ridiculously small. That's about the thickness of of a stack of 3 pennies! When I mounted the magnet at the rim of my wheel as shown in the instructions, the gap between the magnet an sensor was nearly 3 cm, or 6 time too large! I was able to achieve the 5 mm gap by mounting the magnet about halfway down a spoke, but I'm concerned that it will work its way up the spoke over time. At least the wire was long enough. Why not make the magnet a little stronger so that you could have a more reasonable gap?"
1,Died after 3 rides,"My Sigma BC 506 inexplicably died in the middle of riding through Central Park NYC. It was the third ride I had used it on. The computer still functioned but it behaved as though the bike was not moving. At home I detached the sensor from the frame and it would intermittently give false readings (like 127 mph) which makes me think that the cable went bad. I installed it as per the instructions and the cable did not at any point experience any unusual amount of strain. Very shoddy construction.Beyond that, is it so difficult to have two buttons instead of one? It would make using it much more intuitive and would add a trivial amount to the cost of production."
1,what you see is not what you get!,"I specifically ordered this CD for track #5 ""That Time of the Year"" by Brooks Benton, HOWEVER, that track did NOT appear on the CD; neither did several other tracks, in fact, some of the artists were different as well, AND there are only 10 songs on the CD. I am very disappointed! Since the CD was only ..., figured it was cheaper to keep it versus the aggravation of packaging it up, standing in line and the expense of mailing it back. Buyer beware: what you see is NOT what you get!"
4,Worthy of the classic seven,"I take this album as I do all seven Moody Blues LPs from '67 to '72: a creative endeavor that stands solidly on its own.And I don't compare one against another (although I insist with utter conviction that everything after ""Seventh Sojourn"" is not even in the same solar system as the classic seven).But ""A Question of Balance"" is unimpeachable in terms of classic Moody melodies and superb musicianship, from Justin Hayward's furious guitar strumming in the opening ""Question"" to Mike Pinder's pinings in ""How Is It We Are Here?"" and ""Melancholy Man,"" to the closing ""Balance,"" with Pinder's wonderful narrative taking on all things cosmic as reflective of the time -- 1970.Yes, the band took their creativity to higher planes with their last two efforts ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"" and ""Seventh Sojourn,"" but even so, this one has a rightful place on the altar of the classic seven."
5,The Moody Blues & The Meaning Of Life,"Being fairly new to the Moody Blues classic psychedelic sound of the late 60's/early 70's 'Question Of Balance' contains lyrics that I myself find sometimes very difficult to follow.These guys end up being too philosophical for their own good now and again but the music is all together a different story.The scorching,dynamic symphonic rock & roll of ""Question"" and ""Tortoise And The Hare"" begin and end the first part of the album respectively.Everything else here pretty muh sounds like ""Nights In White Satin"",notably the suite like set of songs that finish out the album.Musically the band tend to rely heavily on the sound of the 'Magical Mystery Tour' period Beatles and on baroque pop-pre rock era folk music-very 19'th century British in fact plays a very big part in the sound.And even though this formula was'nt always a success for The Moody Blues 'Question Of Balance' is an album that will hold one's attention throughout without a weak song to be heard."
4,"Very good, not great, balance.","Another terrific surround-mix for a Moody Blues classic. I am only giving this one four stars, however, because of a couple (minor) shortcomings. The bass on this mix is decidedly weak, and I am not one who likes a lot of bass. As well, Justin Hayward's guitar solos are frequently buried in the mix. That's a shame because Justin hit a peak on this album, matched only by ""Seventh Sojourn"", in lyricism and relevance, with his guitar work. Otherwise, this latest iteration of ""A Question of Balance"" is wonderful."
4,A Question of Balance (remastered),"The remastering brings forward sounds that were subtle on the original CD release (and vinyl album). It does create a new listening experience that all ""Moodies"" will enjoy, especially the bonus tracks."
2,Moody Blues: Question of Balance,"For a ""Remaster"" this is the most blah recording I've heard in a long time. Doesn't sound like the Moody Blues. In fact I doubt that it is them!!!"
3,Make sure to get most recent issue,"This CD was shipped promptly and was as described, but was a old BMG issue. I did not remember how bad the old releases were. I downloaded another Moody Blues album (children's,children's,children) that was the newest reissue and it was much better sounding. I will pay more attention to the issue date in the future."
3,just because,This was in my collection and on vinyl wanted to listen again so got the CD format good classic music
5,A Masterpiece from the Moody Blues,"The Moody Blues/ A Question of Balance (1997 remastered): This is the Moody Blues best album in their series of Great albums. Far from being an expression of harmony, it comes across as the story of someone about to fall apart, which may be the edge it needed to become the Masterpiece it is. The 1997 remaster has the original album and no bonus tracks (which is the way I personally like it). There is a newer release that contains bonus tracks. I think that having bonus tracks on a Moody Blues album does little more than distract from the album itself, but that is just my personal preference. Whichever CD you prefer, you will be getting a Masterpiece."
3,"Great music, mix is so-so","I have listened to this album countless times in both vinyl and CD formats. This is not a great rendition of the music in therms of the audio mix. The music is great, but I can't figure out why they didn't do a better job on the re-mix."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrrible!","Was this 5.1 mix, mixed by a stoned 60s hippie? 5.1 means 5.1, not 4.0. There is no center channel or subwoofer action. There are parts of the songs that are either completely missing, or not where they should be. Vocals whispering in my rear speakers? WTF? Thankfully my OPPO BDP95 can select to 2 channel, which isn't a big improvement over the regular cd. Maybe the guy who mixed this album should visit the guy who remixed the old Elton John records into SACD 5.1 I know it says on the cover that it was mixed from the old quad tapes, but it shouldn't tell you 5.1 when it is not. And it carries on to the other Moody blues albums also."
3,Enlightenment Rock,"Some of my fondest memories of Army life were generated atop Mount Scott in Oklahoma (off base from Fort Sill). One of my friends had a battery-powered record player and frequently, we'd spend Saturday nights enjoying the Moodies performing A QUESTION OF BALANCE. It seemed the ultimate in mind-travel. I was very disappointed in the CD because of the ""bonus"" tracks. I felt they distracted from the experience of listening to this wonderfully thought-out concept album. Still, it's a fine piece of work."
3,Not Up To Snuff,"Though a shade better than To Our Childrens Childrens Children, this album is still a far cry from the glory days of Days Of Future Passed through On The Threshold Of A Dream.The album starts promising enough, with the brilliant ""Question,"" but even that is not as good as the original 45. You can get the original 45 mix on Voices In The Sky. Still another mix on This Is The Moody Blues, is better than the Question Of Balance version, too.After ""Question,"" things go down hill very fast. This is almost a two star effort, but only my enormous respect for the Moody Blues upgrades it to three stars."
2,Ouch!,"After ""Lost Chord"" and ""Children's Children's Children"", this album was a huge disappointment. ""Question"" is good, but it goes downhill from there. To me, the album is just too....well, SAPPY. It's amazing to me how anyone could rate this as one of ""their best"".If you must collect everything the Moody Blues ever did then by all means go for it, but for those just becoming familiar with the group, stick with the other 2 mentioned above. If I had bought this album first I may have never bought another Moody Blues album!"
2,"the Flash, then the Dud","The Moody Blues were for my generation the Powerhouse Band that fused hard rock with classical to create dreamscapes. Their signature sound enthralled millions!Yet they started to slip from their pedestals, beginning with this album.The Song ""Question"" was by far one of their most powerful, beautiful and brilliant pieces ever created. Yet the other songs and ballads on this album are, in my opinion, mediocre.The blues resurfaced and climbed their pedestal once again with ""Seventh Sojurn."" From then on, they have never been as creative as they were on ""To Our Children's Children's Children.""The best way to buy this album is to get on an online MP3 service and purchase only the song: ""Question."""
2,Extremely dated,"This is a typical late 60s Moody Blues album. Take a couple of good songs, in this case ""The Question"" and ""And the Tide Rushes In,"" and surround them with a bunch of super pretentious filler material. You're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album."
2,only works for fluval filters,"i bought this because my fish prefer soft water. well, this product is only good for the select fluval filters. anything else and its just a waste of money.no clue if its any good for the fluval filters either, or if fluval filters themselves are good."
5,Can use this with any filter.,I use this to bring down the Ph in my tank without shocking the fish. This media brought my ph down to a 6.5 from an 8.2. I use 3 teaspoons in a small mesh bag (you can get these at any party supply store.)in with my other media filter on my AquaClear filter 50gal filter for a 46gal tank. You could also use the toe of an old pair of ladies stockings/ pantyhose to keep the peat in the filter and not the tank.
3,Maybe its my water...,"My water is a bit hard. Maybe too hard... dGH is around 12 and dKH is at 5-6, pH: 7.8I put a bag (about one cup) of these granules in a marineland 100 biowheel filter and I have not seen any changes in pH. This stuff only yellows my water and browns my plants. Its not as bad as it sounds. the yellow water is not harmful to the fish and the brown stuff on the leaves is just small accumulated particles of peat. Maybe I need more peat? Or what am I doing wrong?I also run the marineland filter with a Fluval C2 which only has two small bags of API's ammo-carb."
2,Doesnt work that well,"I bought this for my 30gal freshwater tank - I recently added two pictus to my tank and the ammonia levels soared..but only after adding this product. When I took it out and just used my regular filter media (activated carbon and cotton balls) my ammonia levels went back to normal. However, during the process, I did lose one pictus - but I think he was sick anyway, he had cloudy eye and wasn't doing as well as the other.Anyhow, I use a tetra whisper filter. I don't think I will be trying this product out again.One positive note, It did soften my water and make it more acidic- too acidic actually. My pH often tested around 6.2..but most of my fish are happier around 6.8.Only did one thing that it promised."
3,Expensive,Cans work fine but are a bit on the expensive side. Funnel seems a bit on the cheaper made side.
1,Lower Quality than older Eagle cans,"I've used Eagle cans for at least a decade. They are safer and sturdier than the common plastic cans. My existing kerosene and gasoline cans have held up well over the years. This can is an example of shoddy workmanship.1. The plastic handle pulled off on the first use. The rivet was not closed and slid out.2. The can is not completely painted. There are bare metal spots around the spout, spout lid, metal handle attachment welds and on the handle.This is a very disappointing purchase from a company typically known for quality products."
5,Tired of PLASTIC breaking.,"All these no spill safety gas cans keep breaking spouts and cracking on me and spill gas all the time! NOT with this Eagle can, this will put the fuel where it should go with control! The can is metal and will not crack in the sun or leak. The 2 gallon is great for chain saws and weed eaters. Try one and you won't go back!!!"
4,Very Good Gas Can,"I've gone through a few plastic cans that kept giving me problems with leaks while filling. I worked with a friend on a burn unit who was himself burned when he ran out of gas while cutting the grass and tried adding fuel to a hot motor --NEVER a good idea. The plastic fill tube on his and on most of mine leaked. I live in Marquette, Michigan and couldn't find any metal cans locally.This can isn't ideal since apparently they have decided we can't have a separate fill opening.Getting gas into the can requires take the plastic funnel off and pulling back the spring loaded gas pour cap while filling. That being said once the gas is in the can you can fuel your machines safe in the knowledge that unless you try to gas a hot engine (and are careless) that you'll be able to complete the task without setting yourself afire."
2,Hard To Fill,"The can looks and feels great. The major drawback is that it's missing a separate fill hole/cap. In order to put gas in the can, you need to remove the funnel. The wear-and-tear on the funnel looks like it could cause the funnel to break easily. No mention anywhere that you can obtain replacement funnels. Otherwise, the one handed operation of the can has a good feel although the balance with a full can is somewhat ackward."
5,Eagle Type I safety can,"I bought several of these after becoming frustrated with the new ""safety spout"" features on the plastic cans. These are well built, sturdy cans that you can pour from without spilling fuel everywhere. If you plan on using these to fill a tank for your deisel engine, I reccommend that you get the funnel spout with it, or get the type II that comes with a metal hose attached."
5,Much Better Than Those Non-steel Ones,The steel gas can is much better than the non-steel ones in terms of safety. The Eagle one is well made and easy to use. I do not have the strength to open the caps of any newer non-steel gas cans no matter the brand. (My strength is good enough to shove 8 inches of wet snow continuously for 5 hours.)
1,"Lid was stuck, funnel is extremely hard to place and remove.","On arrival, I could not get the lid to open. It took about 15 minutes to get it unstuck. It was almost as if it was glued down. This has to be the worst design for a gas can I've ever seen. It is very difficult to get the lid open wide enough where a gas nozzle would fit. You almost need two hands to hold it open that far. I'm not looking forward to trying to fill the thing. The same problem makes it extremely difficult to place or remove the funnel. When the funnel is on, there is not enough clearance to fill the can. I think it would be dangerous to put the funnel in place when the can is full of gas since you would be likely to spill gas all over yourself. To top it all off, Amazon won't allow the return since it could potentially have had gas in it, even though I haven't put any in the can, and will probably throw it out. What a rip off."
1,Not Worth The Price,"I received this Eagle Kersone Can this afternoon. The box it came in was open. There was no instruction manual that came with the can on how to use it. Just a regulatory compliance guide. The painted instructions on the can are uselss. I finally figure out through trial & error on how to open the lid. Considering how much I had to pull on the lever to get the lid open. It would not be easy to fill up, unless you wire the lever to the handle. Or put a board under the lid to keep it open till it was full. I have other kersone containers that are easier to fill up & to pour out. I wouldn't recommend this Kersone Can."
1,Galvanized Steel bad for diesel !,I was very pleased with this Eagle Diesel Safety can until I found lots of very credible online sources indicating galvanized steel containers are not appropriate for storing diesel fuel. The sulfur reacts with the zinc and you end up with particles in your fuel system that cause damage. Eagle Manufacturing would not answer my email inquiry on this subject. I will be replacing mine with a good plastic container.
1,IMPORTANT: Avoid damage!,"""IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Do not use galvanized containers--diesel fuel stored in galvanized containers reacts with zinc coating in the container to form zinc flakes. If fuel contains water, a zinc gel will also form. The gel and flakes will quickly plug fuel filters and damage fuel injectors and fuel pumps.""This is straight from the John Deere manual. The same information is all over the internet that diesel fuel should not be stored in galvanized steel containers. It's ridiculous they sell this can as a diesel can."
1,Poor Choice,"Pros:Meets OSHA standards.Cons:1. The can cannot be filled with the funnel attached.2. The funnel is not designed to be removed/refitted repeatedly.3. The funnel is difficult to put on and take off. I know now why they sell replacement funnels for this product.4. The lid does not lift open far enough to permit easy filling at the gas station.5. The handle to lift the lid is plastic, and its mounting points do not inspire any confidence that they will last more than one season.I made the poor decision to purchase three of these at one time, and they are not returnable."
3,Did not get the product as advertised,Can was advertised to have a funnel. Funnel was not included with the shipment nor provided subsequently.Can was advertised to have a funnel. Funnel was not included with the shipment nor provided subsequently.
5,Gasoline Alley,"Buying items locally is a major reason to purchase from Amazon.com as everyone knows! That said, when you can save on a quality item and cost its' easier on the pocketbook.I tried to purchase a good quality gas can such as this at NAPA Auto Parts and it was priced at $78. Buying a plastic gas can always causes spills because of design and cheap parts. So buying this item at Amazon saved on the original price and no shipping is always a plus.No frills--no spills,I'm Happy!!"
2,Galvanized Steel Should Not Be Used for Diesel,"I bought this can because it is metal, yellow (proper color for diesel), seals tight, and has a pouring funnel. Starting from 5 stars, I subtracted one star for the plastic handle which seems destined to fail earlier than a metal handle would. Then I learned that galvanized steel should not be used to store diesel fuel -- my John Deere manuals explicitly state that this will create a zinc sludge that will clog my fuel filters and damage injectors. So, I had to subtract two more stars. Perhaps it does not deserve any stars since it completely fails to do the thing that I bought it for (i.e. store diesel fuel) but it is a really nice can. So now it stores gasoline -- I just hope that no one uses it to fill my tractor."
4,Better than my old plastics...,"I will say that it is much better than even the no spill plastics that I used to have but it is not perfect. If I had to do it again I would spend a little more and get a Type 2 can. With this can you still have to pour the correct way or you will get some gas the leaks from where the funnel and the can attach. I have found that it mainly only happens when you tip the can up and back multiple times in a row, so it is not a huge deal, but it is annoying.Besides that the can seems very sturdy, it sits well in the back of a truck, it is the perfect size for my generator and lawnmower and if you read the instructions and release the pressure from the can before use (away from you) it performs very well.The leaking issue is kind of a big one for me, but it can be worked around and the build of the can is rock solid so overall this still gets 4 stars."
4,Works as intended,"The can itself is well made and the lid closed as intended. However, when the funnel is attached, gasoline leaks a little from the connected area. It is still far better than plastic cans."
5,Top of the line-Made in U.S.A.,"As soon as you see this can you know it is the absolute best that money can buy. Well made, thick gauge steel, nice enamel finish,and welded on handle are a few of the features that set this apart from the cheaper ones. This can is going to outlive me by a long shot. Made in U.S.A.....you can tell!!"
5,Best gas can out there!,"Forget those spill-proof plastic containers. This one is a little costly, but I plan on using it for many years to come. And unlike the ""spill-proof"" ones, I don't lose any fuel on the ground."
4,I like it!,"The gas can will probably out-last me. I have three I use them all the time. The funnel is another matter, it's shoddy and they only last about a year. So I buy funnels way too often. Sure wish they would improve the UV resistance of the plastic."
1,Doesn't Work,"These have a really, really basic problem - they fall off. Another reviewer mentions using duct tape to hold them on - which completely flies in the face of their purpose - to quickly move the hose from machine to machine. The plastic is too hard and the taper isn't designed properly. Manufacturing quality isn't great - they are only more-or-less round and given the taper problems and hard plastic, the results aren't good: They don't slide on most machines' dust outlets deeply enough, they don't seat, and they don't fully seal. I went back to using the raw hose end, which works fine when using a soft hose."
3,Not spectacular...,"I found it a little difficult to get it to thread on my 4"" pipe and it didn't seem like it would stay put without a spring clamp. Serves it's purpose though."
3,"Great idea, no staying power","The 4 inch quick connect threads onto the hose properly but the slip-fit side is taperd to much and does not have enough of an interference fit to stay connected to my equipment, it falls off while in use."
2,Eh....didn't really fit that great,"I tried to use this thing to connect to the 4"" output of my delta jointer and planer, but it just doesn't fit that great... I don't know if I'm just dumb or what, but I was under the impression that it should attach to any machine with a 4"" dust port. It didn't fit my machines..."
4,Missing history revelaed!!!,"In 1926 Portugal became a military dictatorship. Soon after European fascism took over the country as fascism swept europe replacing the governments of Italy(1922), Germany(1933), Spain(1939) and Hungary(1944). Yet this history of portugal remains largelyunderstudied and no other volume exits in English describing Portugals dictatorship.Unfortunatly this book explores more the philosophy of fascism and the interworkings of the government of Salazr rather then looking at the foriegn policy and politics of fascism in Portugal.Portugal, upon the end of Fascist rule, wuickly gave up its colonies in Africa, where Cubans were quickly dispatched to Angola and Mozambique.THis is an interesting book, mostly because it is one of the few on the subject. An interestign time and an interesting country that is frequently overlooked."
1,racketeering of the worst kind,"I recently tryed buying this dictionary within a larger order from Amazon.While all items in my order had their payment accepted, the one related to this book had not; and I received a cancelation notification.Following Amazon's instructions - and interested in acquiring it - I would order it again, only to realize that its price had changed at the same time of the cancelation. This, from any costumer's point of view, is racketeering of the worst kind; an ill-timed opportunistic behaviour of bad-faith aimed at extracting more from returning clients.It is ethically unacceptable that a cancelled item be immediately available again for a higher price.For retuning custumers resolute not to expose themselves to this type of dishonest behaviour from Amazon, beware!"
2,Clumsy,This set is very heavy- and it takes a long time to unscrew the tops off. Not really worth the money.
4,A pleasure from beginning to end.,"Richard Marius was a wonderfull writer. ""The Coming of Rain"" is one of those tales that you can go to and let the cares and woes of the world pass on by, because you are in ""Bourbonville"" for a while. This is the third Richard Marius book I have read, in that I came on board in the middle with ""After the War"", then mannaged to get ""An Affair of Honor"" and now, ""The Coming of Rain"" I am ordering ""Bound for the Promise Land"" today.If you like beautiful, descriptive writing, tongue in cheek observation and believable, interesting characters, read some Richard Marius."
3,A tedious read!,"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. She knew that I liked historical novels.I was absolutely turned off by the excessive use of the ""N"" word.As an educated Afro-American male, I was very disgusted.I am so glad that this period of American history is over!The treatment of most of the slaves was horrendous. I think there's a special place in hell for slave owners who subjected innocent human beings to total degradation."
1,Be warned....,"Replacement Battery Cartridgefor The Su1400rm2uAlthough ad claims by ""APC"" it doesn't appear that the item I received was the OEM battery...stickers are for ""ABC"" - close, by not APC. I haven't installed yet, but don't be fooled like I was. Returns are a hassle, so I guess I'll keep it. I hope Amazon does a better job of policing this supplier in the future."
2,Not OEM Equipment,"The photo depicts OEM APC battery replacements. I paid more for this item because of it. Others offered third party batteries, for less than this product, but since this item depicted OEM parts, this is the one I selected. BIG mistake. First, the packaging was horrible. Neither the internal or external boxes were sealed, by the time they arrived. Then, I found out that I was shipped third party batteries (a couple actually had APC stickers placed over top of the third party vendor's label). The worst part is that Amazon will not accept batteries as returns, so I'm stuck with this very pricey knockoff."
4,Good so far,"I have bad luck with headphones. Usually one ear starts shorting out, or the wire breaks, or something. So far, these have held up. Both ears still work, and the wire is coated in a fabric and also has a stretchy elastic section that I think is protecting it from my usual clumsy wear and tear. The sound is what you'd expect from the price, not amazing, but perfectly okay."
4,"Very Tough, and powerful","This is the toughest drill I have ever owned. I have had it for over three years, and have honestly abused it. The quality is very good, and it is plenty powerful. The only downside is that it is fairly heavy, but that is to be expected in a hammer option drill. It has put down subfloors, drilled into countless cinderblocks, built a shed, and many other things, and still works the same. This is a good drill for it's type."
5,Great stuff,"I've purchased my first P C 10years ago and I still use it, but it is wearing out.I hope this one will last just as long or longer."
2,Replacement battery,Gave this a low rating after having to replace the battery that came with it would not hold a charge after less than a year and very limited use. Great drill with functioning battery.
2,Gears stripped after two years,"This drill did not get used every day but it did get used fairly often. I am surprised that this weekend while driving some relatively small lag bolts, the gears stripped out. This is the end of a rather lackluster tool. Before this untimely death I had experiences other dissapointments, including a chuck that would freeze and require two pairs of large pliers to release, a strong ozone smell coming from the motor, and battery life that was quite a bit shorter that the Makitas that I owned before this one. I went with the Porter/Cable brand because I thought I was buying American. I now believe these are made in Mexico. I think I will go with a Panasonic to replace this one because of the good reviews for battery life and real metal gears."
5,Great Dependable Cordless Drill,"This is the first cordless drill that I purchased and I am quite amazed at the power this drill has for its size. Just select the torque and this drill just goes through anything you put in front of it. Additionally, this drill has a hammer drill mode, select this mode and drilling a hole in concrete, brick or stone is just an after thought. This is a sturdy drill, it stood up to drops and continual use at the jobsite. It handles auger bits and goes through a 4x4 post like a hot knife through butter. This drill comes with a carrying case with a compartment to store drill and driver bits. Comes with a battery charger and extra battery to keep you drilling til you get tired. The chargers takes about an hour to fully charge a battery. If you need a drill that can handle the biggest to the smallest jobs this drill is the one for you."
1,The author means well but cannot help you ....................,"One quote from this book should be all I need to show you how out of touch this author is. ""... a newborn infant has no way to merit love or affirmation ..."" (P. 76). This could be written only by someone who is so disconnected that he does not understand the concept of unconditional love, because he has never felt it. Merit is an irrelevant concept. A loving parent loves a child unconditionally, automatically.On page 12 he writes of ""the message of unconditional love ..."". But unconditional love is not a message - it is a feeling. And if you can't feel it, you are emotionally crippled, and completely unqualified to offer advice to anyone about anything.The only way to deal successfully with anger is to deal with the feelings behind it. And the only place to start on that journey is to read ""The Biology Of Love"" by Arthur Janov."
1,Not Worth the Ink,"I bought this for my husband, who was willing & interested in dealing with his anger issues. Both of us agreed that it was just a silly pile of psycho-babble. Really."
3,disappointed,"The book content itself is informative. Much information one already knows. From a therapist's point of view, much more could have been touched on in regards to effective ways to evaluate why we let ourselves become angry. There are ALWAYS underlying causes and many times our current anger or outburst of anger is not due to what is right in front of us at that moment but unresolved issues from our past. That was not expounded on in the book. It is a book for those individuals who have not really researched or read about anger. A good beginner's book on anger. It is easy to read.I wished I had a clue that there would be so much highligting and underlining in the book or I would not have purchased that particular one. Sender was not honest about how much he/she wrote in the book."
2,Not what I expected,"If you were born into a really dysfunctional family and never received basic people skills training then this book is for you. However, if you have over time realized that the world around you had made you forget the lessons you learned as a child and caused you to be less than the person you now want to be then look for another book. The book is filled with interviews of people who never were given the chance to learn how to cope. I was looking for a simple refresher on the psychology of what makes us angry and how to rethink those issues. The book does provide that but it does it in hundreds of pages instead of the 40-50 pages that it needed to use. If your time is valuable look for another book."
4,Very helpful.,"If you have an anger problem I would highly recommend this book. I would not recommend the book as an answer to all anger problems. Please if you are having major issues or anyone is being physically or mentally hurt by your problems, don't be afraid to ask for professional help. That being said this book is a very helpful accompaniment to group or individual therapy. It does expand your mind and offer real world examples that you may be easily able to relate to. I still go back and re read a lot of the entries and find them helpful and relaxing. This book is definitely worth the read if you struggle with a temper."
1,Did not get APC,"I ordered this one specifically because it was listed as an APC Brand Replacement Battery. I received an American Battery Company battery, but I ordered it for a critical UPS that was almost dead so I had no choice but to keep it. I'm not a happy customer."
1,Warning - not an APC manufactured battery,"I ordered this specifically because it was shown as an APC product. The seller sent an ABC (American Battery Corporation) battery which is an inferior product compared to the APC battery (less amp hours). Do not buy if you are expecting an APC battery. Also, you can buy an ABC battery for less from someone else."
2,Didn't work very well with my Motorola Slvr.,"I've had my Slvr for one week and was extremely careful, but I managed to get a slight scratch in it and a couple smaller spyder web scratches below the bigger one. Neither of them were deep, at all. I could barely feel the bigger one with my nail. It was caused by a small ring I put in my pocket for no more then 2 minutes. Anyway I taped the phone off very carefully and started small. I rubbed very hard. Little to no results. I then applied more displex and rubbed harder and longer. I tried this for over 20 minutes rubbing about as hard as you can. The smaller spyder scratches are gone but the bigger one is as clear as ever. In fact, it's even more noticeable now that the damn screen is so polished up."
1,Be careful!!!!,"I had previously used Displex on an older phone with great success. Now I had a small scratch on my (relatively) new K800. I got the polish out and started rubbing - IT COMPLETELY MESSED UP MY DISPLAY...Now I probably have to buy a new display or get a new phone! I don't know if they use another material in the new displays, but I would suggest being careful with this product!"
1,Didn't work!!! Made it worse!,"I don't know what to do!!! I Did everything the directions said and now I have more scratches then ever on my brand new phone!!! Now I have to save up to busy a new LCD screen, Thanks alot Displex!"
2,Misleading title of the book,"Not a user-friendly book. Unlike the title ""common sense"" for amateurs to understand. It tries to say too much, with difficult theories. I have plenty dressage books which discuss the same theories, I didn't have to buy this one."
3,Revelant material.,"Although the material was useful, I found the organization and presentation a bit confusing for the novice."
2,"Great Game, Locks Up Every Play",Yes this game is one of the best. Nice play and interesting missions. I'll get to the point. Mine locks up every time i play within thirty minutes or so. I have looked for an answer to the problem and yet to find one.
2,Online Nerds UNITE!!!,"I wanted to play with buddies at my own home - CANT. You must pay for the online services of your xbox360 for ALL NERDS TO UNITE ONLINE. I guess the hype and high ratings come from those fellas with the head sets and small biceps. I hate that most ""BIG"" games now days seem to be online driven and designed for that type of play. Hey, I guess whatever makes money right? Monkeys see, so monkeys do..."
2,Try the demo before you buy - dissapointing when compared to other games in the same genre,"I was dissapointed in two areas, enough to give it a 2 star rating:1 - in-scene/game experience - when compared to Battlefield 2, Ghost Recon (GRAW 2), and Halo 3, I found the game experience in COD4 very linear and constrained. In this respect, it is closer to Medal of Honor Airborne, which I prefer from the recent batch of games in this genre.2 - graphics - it did not find it as visual compelling and presenting as rich of an environment as GRAW 2 or Halo 3On the positive side, it felt consistent in terms of performance (fps) and the cut scenes are very interesting and well made.Overall, I recommend trying it out before buying, so that you are not disappointed afterwards."
2,Ehh.......,"Today games are focused for online play. The hype for this game was saying that its comparible to GOW or HALO 3 online play. NOT EVEN CLOSE, the multiplayer aspect of this game is poorly done. The game itself was ok...very repetitive. The story is good, everything else is just plain. Graphics...awesome, but the game itself...just boring really.the coolest thing about the game...the trailor."
1,Game was boring,I owned the game for a week and then sold it. I did not play online. I really did not like the game.
4,Great game!,"I should have never bought this game. Quick and easy start and setup. Multi-player login is a breeze, i find myself loading this in more then my other games when i only have a little time to kill. Of course i wind up playing for hours, trying to level up or unlocking some new weapon or add on. Totally wrecking my sleep. Last night my ""I'll just play for 20 minutes"" became 2 hours. Of well, a great game will do that to you. Fantastic FPS. Really sucks you into the game. I recommended it on XBOX360. The achievements are great fun also."
5,Game of the Year!,The Live is fanatstic! Very similar to COD2. Much better than COD3. The MP44 is back! Buy it now and join the fun. You won't be disappointed.
4,"Four and a Half Stars, Actually.....","Great looking, handles like a dream; There are some fantastic visuals here, making you feel you are stuck right in the middle of some serious firefights. The graphics are sharp and crisp, although many of the levels reminded me more of WWI & II types in terms of color schemes; Very dark & grey-ish most of the time; The helicopter stuff was a blast and the certain 'explosion' sequence was a shocker. My only complaint was there was no way to peak around corners like say in R6: Vegas(which was a little more intense to me, as well as colorful...). All the five stars reviews you have read are right on the money; This is a fantastic looking and playing FPS, no doubt about it."
5,GET THIS GAME!!!,"If you have any interest at all in military-type shooters like Rainbow 6 & Ghost Recon...GET THIS GAME!! If you loved Battlefield 2 or the classic BF1942 Mod ""Desert Combat""...GET THIS GAME!!! Don't hestitate for a second...scroll up, click on the BUY IT NOW button and thank me later.I picked up the PC version of this game yesterday and have not been able to stop playing it. The graphics and gameplay are incredible and that's just in single player mode. The multiplayer mode is even better. It is everything you wanted in a multiplayer military shooter but didn't know to ask. Trust me when I say...THIS GAME ROCKS!!!"
4,who doesnt play cod.,i know they may exist but who hasnt played cod. i just wanted all the modern warfare games. i bundled them and purchased them all for less than the price of one new copy of modern warfare 3.
4,Arrived Early!,"I ordered the original COD:MW last week and didn't expect to see it for a long while. Yet, it arrived a day before it's estimated delivery date! This is the classic and awesome."
5,Purely a Gaming Masterpiece!,"This game is THE perfect shooter, engaging storyline, PERFECT MULTIPLAYER! better than halo 3, ive spent nearly 10 days on the cod4 multiplayer alone! im 5th prestige lvl 40! Purely A gaming masterpicce.Overall: Amazing, theres not really anything else i can say"
5,Best looking game so far,"The xbox live features of this game is the best. Go head to head with total strangers and the fun never ends. Visually one of the best game and the game play is fantastic. Well worth the price. Forget GTA4, get this."
4,WWII Out...Modern Era In,"Infinity Ward has finally realized that World War II is now ancient history. Call of Duty 4 is, all hands down, the best FPS set in the modern era. In this game, you get to kill Islamic extremists and Russian ultranationals instead of the same old, played out Nazis that we're all too familiar with by now. From battling thugs on a Russian cargo ship to blasting gunmen from thousands of feet in the air, this game does a superb job of simulating combat with modern weapons and today's state-of-the-art technology. The only problem is that they should have added A LOT more levels for the single-player campaign, that is, if you don't have Xbox Live. Nevertheless, the gunfights in the single-player campaign are very intense and it seems as though you are always surrounded by enemy soldiers. You must beat some very difficult odds just to get through an entire level without dying at all even on just Regular. If you're a fan of modern warfare games, this is a MUST-BUY."
3,"Very good game,","Call of duty 4 is a very good game,great features but you can`t play system link with your friends and it was one of the reason because i bought it."
4,cod 4,I only play one game on xbox live and this is the game i prefer. There is a issue i dont care for and that is i seem to continually get dropped from the game as it ends and then have to rejoin another group instead of playing on and on with the same group.This is something that needs to be addressed. Gary
5,Addictingly Fun,When I first purchased Call of Duty 2 it blew me away. 3 was fun to play but seemed to lack something. I was waiting enthusiastically for Call of Duty 4 and when it hit the shelves I was there to pick it up. Boy was I not disappointed. It is addictingly fun.The only draw back is that it is a bit on the short side. Not a big deal as the replay value is high.
4,Great Game but not the best,I have played every call of duty game and this is by far the best game. The fighting sequences are fun and interesting. The graphics and battle effects are very well done.I only have 2 complaints with this game. Like many people whos reviews I have read the friendly fire issue is an annoyance. I found myself shooting my own people far too often but at a distance they look just like the enemy. The other complaint are the attack dogs. I seemed to do ok if I shot them from a distance but if they closed the gap I was killed 9 out of 10 times. It got to be quite annoying getting killed by the same dog over and over again. The game is well worth playing and I still recommend it.
5,A halo killer,"I think this game is mostly about online play to be honest. I thought the game was fun on campaign mode it was a breeze to go by and you get to see alot of what real war is like! The sound is comparable to a real battlefield. The gameplay will make you want to replay this game over and over again. And online play is very addictive, I think its compared to halo 3 on the level of fun. Great game if you have live or not! Give it a shot"
5,Call Of Duty 4 : Modern FUN!!,"The game play on this game meets all the media hype!! If you are into the first-person shooters, this is a must have."
4,Addictive....,"Excellent game from a veteran's perspective. Storyline could be longer, but the online play is great! In my opinion, better than any of the Halo trilogy. Extremely addictive!"
4,Hm. Some Thoughts,I liked this game.My only problem is that the devs didn't pay very much attention to the water.When are we gonna get some GoW level water realism?That is all.
5,Greatest FPS I've Played In a LONG Time,"Ok, so Halo 3 was incredible (so exclude that from my review)... That aside, Call of Duty 4 has without a doubt the best graphics, gameplay, sound, voice acting and emotional storytelling I've ever seen in an FPS. Much of the action will have you completely glued to your seat, (especially the stealth levels in the nuked city.) This game has incredible controls as well, making the experience feel completely natural.If you love a good FPS or action game, buy COD4 and be blown completely away."
2,Good Graphics - Terrible Freezing Problems,"I am stuck on the second level of this game (Marine Sgt Paul Jackson) where the game freezes 100% of the time within one area of the game. I have restarted the game for days and dozens of times and the game freezes at about the same physical point in the game all the time. I can approach the block from the left, center, or flanking right and it freezes an approximately the same boundary point.Google ""COD4 freezing"" or anything similar and you'll find reports of thousands of users who are experiencing hardware issue caused by the games use of resources or software freezing issues such as I encounter.I asked my teenage son about it and he reported he and his friends gave up on the game over the Christmas break - they all couldn't successfully regularly run the game.No similar problems with COD2 or COD3 so its definitely this release. Check this problem out before you buy, so at least you're informed. There's no fix reported yet for this problem."
3,the graphics are amazing,well cod4 graphically is a awsome game but sorry iam not really feeling the action iam fps fan but i was so confused weapon and heck you dont even now who the bad guy is half online or off. times when you play story mode its like your not even there but codos for grat ai but it feel like the player is not even needed to me and online is cool i just dont like the way the weapon feel when you shoot and i cant tell whos a enemie or not gotta say that again this is my first time owning a cod game so I just dont see how its so amazing but hey this might be the greatest game for you good luck with your decision me I rather paly gears of war waiting on pt 2
4,Awesome game,"I bought this game for my son and all he says is ""it's an Awesome game"".I guess that says it all."
5,The Multiplayer game of the year,"This game in my opinion is one of the best games of the year. The single player is short however, it really picks up in the multiplayer aspect of the game. With matches like dethmatch, team deathmatch, and domination it really ranks high. I would rate this game over Halo 3 for its look and feel. This in my opinion is a must have for any 360, PS3, or pc owner."
5,COD 4 deliverd,OK don't let me fool you it was short. It was damn short. But I have not been glued to the screen like that for a while. I got the game at 6pm and was finished that night at 2am. The multyplayer is fun. The singleplayer rules. You need to own this game.~z
3,Pay Attention to the Rating,"I own all of the game in this series, and play them often with my 13 year old son. On a recent trip to Normandy, he was well versed in the details of the battle based in part of some of his experience with the Call of Duty series. I picked up the latest installment on the day of its release, but I failed to notice that it is rated ""M"" for mature, as opposed to ""T"" as were the previous installments.The rating is appropriate, so much so that I found the game totally inappropriate for a 13 year old. Islamic extremists, abduction, rendition, nuclear terror attacks and the like may be, unfortunately, a reality of today's world; however, I have no intention of simulating them in my family room. I sold the game second-hand and bought Guitar Hero III for him.As an aside, I think the game it well done, and if you are an adult who can easily separate simulation from reality, you'll like the game. Just be careful with the kids."
5,great game,It's a great game that brings you into modern warfare which I like better than those WWII games. I got a great deal with fast shipping from the seller.
5,Amazing,"This game is oodles of fun. I've spent countless hours on xbox live and many more playing the campaign. If you really want a challenge, play veteran mode, if you are a standard gamer you will be screaming and trying to throw your controller through the TV pretty quickly in veteran."
4,great GAME BUT TOO SHORT,"This IS THE BEST CALL OF DUTY GAME HANDS DOWN, I HAVED PLAYED ALL THEIR PREVIOUS WORLD WAR GAMES AND BY FAR THIS GAME HAS THE BEST STORY YET (MODER WARFARE). The GAMEPLAY IS GREAT AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN ACTUAL WAR.. THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE GAME IS TOO SHORT....BUT IS A GREAT GAME ANYWAY"
5,fu*kin awsome,"for the people thet gave it 1 star you are retarded. this game is the best you can shoot through walls.on xbox live you can customize your guns and make your own classes.there are alot of xbox live gametypes like team death match,sabatoge,hardcore team, and freefor all. that is only a few there are like 7 more game types.so buy this f*kin game it is worth the $60.00 even if you dont have xbox live."
5,Best Call of Duty,"One of the best game out for any system. Come for the single player, stay for the multiplayer. You will have many WOW moments in the single player campaign and will keep wanting more. The multiplayer, with its ranking system, will keep you hooked for months. I won't restate everything that has been said, but you need to buy this game. I don't see how Infinity Ward will top themselves."
5,Not your daddys COD,"After 3 CODs, where you just run around with guns and shoot people there is finally a game where someone obviusly consulted with military professionals on everything from how people in the military really talk, to how characters enter and clear rooms....this has a real feel about it. The detail is incredible - bravo!"
2,More of the same,"I really disliked CoD3, and I heard so many good things about CoD4 that I bought it rather than rent it. I regret that decision. Sure it's better than CoD3 (which was a train wreck), it's more of the same. It just pales in comparison to many of the FPS out there. You're better off with BioShock, Halo 3, or Orange Box."
5,Chef,"This is a good game, graphics are out of this world, platform is greatall around fun, This one is a keeper."
5,Awesome (I was Sceptical),"I thought the first three CODs were okay, but repetitive. I was more a fan of Halo. But I can rush to judgment, and I only gave Halo 3 four stars at release, now it would surely be five. The same went for this, it took me a day to get used to, and I decided it is amazingly fun.A MUst Own- I originally rented this to save money, but I ended up buying it because it's so amazing. The single player is fun although short, but the multiplayer is the best any game has yet to offer. Nex- Gen through and through."
5,Remarkable!!,"Remarkable free-form game that allows you to jump into any of a multiple of scenarios for any one operation.You can play a completely different game for the same operation simply by landing by parachute somewhere else on the visible area on the computer screen.One minus I would possibly give is that they don't allow the shooter to go into the prone position. When you're getting shot at, the tendency is to get your body as close to the ground as you can.Another is that when you think you have your own guys covering your back, you suddenly find yourself getting shot by the enemy coming at you from a direction you thought your guys were covering.All-in-all, this game is the best by far. I'll be looking forward to their next release."
3,Not as good as expected.,Okay but not excellent. Online is fun but then it gets repetitive. I also thought it had a short Campaign mode. The action is satisfying and the graphics are gorgeous. I was hoping for it to be better than Gears of War or Halo 3 but it is not. Halo 3 and Gears are still one of the best online shooters out there.
2,Rent it but don't waste the 50 bucks.,"You should rent it for the single player campaign. Although it is short, it is exciting and has some cool cut scenes (FP execution anyone?).The multiplayer is highly overrated. There are so many glitches and bad spawns that after a while it just gets frustrating. Spawned in the middle of airstrikes, grenades, and even in the middle of enemy territory really blunt any tactical feel this game ever had. Also the helicopters have god powers.The guns are unbalanced. On consoles, use the M16: it's a one shot kill. On PC, use the P90. Plus frag x3, juggernaut, grenade launchers, and martyrdom make the online experience a really really annoying one."
2,Disappointed,"In fairness, I haven't tried multiplayer yet. Mainly because the single player was so disappointing. It's hard to tell what's going on in places. At some points you take the view of a different character, which may seem cinematic but turns out to be a cheesy gimmick. In one mission, your name might be ""Smith"" then in the next mission they're yelling at ""Martinez"" for 20 minutes before you realize it's you and you need to be doing something you're not. The visuals are nice, and the actual combat system seems decent, which leads me to believe the multiplayer function may be where it's at. Sadly, the single player campaigns were just so frustrating I didn't want to keep playing.Do yourself a favor, get Halo 3 if you don't have it, or wait on Battlefield: Bad Company. I thought since this was on sale for 35 bucks it would be worth it. I was wrong."
3,no split screen,"The game is very fun and never seems to get old. I am, however, very unhappy with the lack of split screen. It seems like most of the best titles (other than halo) seem to leave out split screen options which really ruins the experience for me. Buy this game if you like tactical class based fps games and don't mind playing alone."
4,INCREDIBLE,"The following review pertains specifically to the single-player mode. I have XBOX Live, but I have not played the multiplayer version of this game - I've been having too much fun on single planer!It's difficult to describe the game any less than incredible. The graphics are pristine (XBOX 360 w/HDMI, 32"" LCD HDTV). The controls are very simple to learn. There are varying levels of difficulty that makes the game playable to a majority of people. I like how I'm able to go back into Arcade Mode (after you beat the game) and replay different levels - earning points toward ""high scores.""Future improvements: Make the single-player mode longer! I finished the single-player game (recruit mode) in about 5 hours. That's way too short - so I shall be going back to a more challenging level. Other than this, there really are no other complaints.[...]"
5,The best of the the call of duty games,The single player part of this game just pulls you into the story for sure... i would say everyone should have this in there collection of games... because after the single player the fun don't end there.. the multi-player part of the game is just intense as ever... loads of fun for sure.
3,call of duty 4,Kinda feel ripped off...the game is great effect wise but it was over too quick...I think $50 is too much too pay for such little entertainment...and I don't happen to be an online player so I get no residual value.
4,Short And Sweet,"I want to keep this as short and sweet as possible...overall this game is extremely fun, graphics are amazing, single player is exceptionally difficult on veteran(mile high club >=[) which keeps the player wanting to strive for the finish, and online play is equally fun if not better!The only drawback to this game is that online gets very repetative, infinity ward needs to create new maps and change the spawn points...thats probably the most aggrivating thing about it but overall it is definately worth buying! Happy Gaming!"
4,Best CoD so far in my opinion,"Great game! The multiplayer is very simple and balanced, while still being extremely fun and very addicting. Single player is fun, but as with all call of duty games, everyone buys for the multiplayer. This game is in opinion the best multiplayer game so far!"
2,Living On Their Past Merits...,"Seriously, this stuff doesn't live up to much of anything. SW's lyrics are a bore, and the noisy production makes it near impossible to distinguish Slash's playing from that of Dave Kushner's. Two guys trying to play leads over each other is silliness. Amazon's review is a joke, how much did the record co. have to pay the critics to give this stuff a good review? And, really, this album lacks even half the energy of ""Contraband,"" VR's debut. This is all coming from a guy who saw VR live in '05 and loved it, and I also loved the debut, but really, save your money and your time and stay away... what a huge disappointment this was. ""Libertad"" is throw away bunk... you'll be taking it to the used cd store to trade it in unless you're a completist of the GNR & STP catalogues."
3,Album is okay.,"I bought the album the day of it's relase expecting the band to put forth a strong follow-up album than the debut. The debute was good, this one is not as good. I get the sense that Slash and the boys are trying to showcase a style of rock that is more modern and that they are deliberately trying to distance themselves from the Guns n Roses sound and more like STP. Fair enough, but in doing so they also distance themselves from the brilliant guitar work that Slash is capable of. Only on a few tracks do you hear him riff or solo apart from the rest of the band. It seems to me that a great frontman in a rock band is complimented by a great guitarist; on this album, Scott Weland is in form but Slash isn't that guitarist."
4,Good 2nd Album,"This Album continues their success of Contraband. Not as good, but you can definitely enjoy this CD. Most of the songs become better and better the more you listen to them. I'm stuck on The Last Fight."
3,Libertad,Not as strong as the first album but one that grows on you the more it is played. The tour promoted it well and having seen Welland perform I think his live vocal performances are better than on the CD
3,3.5 stars,"After 3 whole listenings to this cd I think I'm ready to talk about it, this is really different from VR debut album, Contraband is really melodic and very very G 'n R sounding, this time they got rid of that sound, and I think for the first time creating their own sound, the cd rocks, but something is missing, good guitar riffs, good soloing by Mr. Slash, but no standout song, just as a whole is a good cd and nice to listen to it, maybe next release will be better."
4,Great band with no development,Velevet Revolver is such a good composition of musicians!But this CD shows that the huge potentials of the members must not follow up to an adequate album.But 3 stars for a good rock album others in this time aren't able to do.Btw: The CD was worth buying in the USA and waiting 5 weeks to be here in Germany. ...and it was cheaper though there were costums duty ;-)
2,Reality,"Typical Velvet Revolver album. One great rock song, one mediocre ballad and the rest is repetitive trash."
2,unimpressed,"Didn't like it, maybe 2 tracks are listenable. Smashing Pumpkins new album is far better, but has lower ratings on Amazon."
1,Coaster,"This album sounds like a scott weiland solo album, i listened to it 2 times all the way through and just couldnt find anything worth listening to, i was hoping for a hard rock/rock album and they come out with a retro album, you cant really even tell slash is on the album other than a few solos. I gave it away."
2,Not worth purchasing,"A couple thoughts on this album upon first and second play throughs:- A very generic sounding album-I wanted to check the calander to see if this was 1988 or 2008- This sure doesn't sound anything like STP, GNR or Alice in Chains or any other hard rock band- The songs trudge along like I do on a full day at the office -- This should be a favorite among the mulletheads in the crowd.- Thankfully my local library had this cd to check out, it saved me some cash. I'm returning it now because it sucks.- I can see why it dropped quickly off the charts- most people probably used iTunes to download 1 or 2 tracks and called it good at that.Some of the 5 star reviewers said you could here the excitement and fun in Weiland's voice. Guess I must be listening to an entirely different album.-btw I'm not some Linkin' Park lovin' poser. My favorite bands include Metallica, AC/DC, GnR (of course) early 7marythree and others. Although I enjoy a wide range of music as everyone should."
5,Great Album from a Great Band,"This album is extremely well produced and has a great sound. Their first Album has nothing on this album, Libertad is very capable of satisfying those who have heard most of their previous album, Contraband. The single released before the whole album is not the best on the album. I find myself enjoying the whole album instead of released singles getting all the play time.Overall, Great Album from a great Band"
4,"As Good, if Not Better, Than Album #1","Surprise, surprise--Velvet Revolver survive the sophomore slump and put out a decent record. While there aren't any stand-out singles upon the first couple of listens, there's plenty of melody and sweet guitar work to go around. If I had to compare it to anything, it sounds a little like latter-day Stone Temple Pilots (Shangri-La-Dee-Da-era) with better guitar solos. The only real downside is that the two best songs aren't even on the standard release--""Messages"" is available only on iTunes, while ""Psycho Killer"" appears as a track on theMelody and the Tyranny EP.Guns'n'Roses fans probably aren't going to be too thrilled, however, so approach with caution--if you didn't like the first one, this album's not going to change your mind about Velvet Revolver."
4,Best Album of 2007 so far!,"I love it!, not a bad track here, Much better then the first one, this sounds like a band not some mash throwed together, rocks much harder then ""Contraband""."
3,not as good as contraband,"i've been looking forward to this album for a long, long time and i've come away fairly dissapointed. libertad is far from a bad album, but there's almost nothing that stands out, and slash really doesn't have a great solo here. i listened to it 5 or 6 times tuesday through today, then stuck in contraband to hear what great VR sounds like. ""gravedancer"" is probably my favorite among a bunch of mediocre-good songs. i hope the good reviews keep coming in though because i want these guys to keep going. they have some great records in them for sure, this just isn't one."
2,Weak effort by supposed supergroup,"I listen to a lot of music. This is a mediocre effort, one that was hyped by the band as being a better effort than last album...I don't think so. only about 3 good songs on album, rest just blend in. I expect better from this level of talent and so should you...As far as i'm concerned, experiment over...lets see STP back together...I think slash's creativity for new riff's went up in smoke with his drug habit.."
3,"OK, but don't like the change in style","I was looking forward to this album with some trepidation because of the interviews from the band members I read. They kept making comments about changing their sound and going in a new direction, which in terms of hard rock/heavy metal bands usually translates to mean they are sonically castrating themselves. This album isn't as bad as I thought it would be, the melodies and songs are good. Unfortunately, it does not have the balls and the fire that the first album had, no way."
2,Its no STP,I was not impressed.Its like listening to GNR without Axle.Scott needs STP to get the most of his talent.The Deleos ROCK!
4,Libertad,"`Libertad' is the second album from Velvet Revolver and it has a much more coherent feel about it. The sound is refined, the riffs are more powerful and the band seem to have gelled more. Produced by the great Brendan O'Brien you already have an inkling about what this album will offer and from the opener `Let It Roll' you know you won't be disappointed. Slash plays better on this album and his distinctive sound is to the fore throughout and Scott Weiland sounds more polished and at ease than on `Contraband`. If you enjoyed their first album it's a safe bet you'll be impressed by this and if you found `Contraband' to be lacking then give this a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,I was a bit skeptical...,because honestly I didn't really like contraband. Sounded to much like to many other bands...in my humble opinion. However this one is miles better and just awesome straight ahead rock the real way. Wonderful. Outdid themselves whatever formula they used!
4,Another great album - but not as good as the first,"This is another great album by one of the best rock bands to come around in the last five years.Best cut on the album is ""Mary Mary"" while the most disappointing track is that throw-away country song parody that appears as a bonus track at the end.Uh, I sure hope that song was a parody, right?"
4,Unexpected,"This album was a huge suprise. I got contraband because I was a rageing STP fan and mildly interested in GNR. I was not sure what to expect with contraband, but it ended up being a huge dissappointment. I listened to it about 3 times and it has since been collecting dust. So I baught Libertad because I am a completeist, and I was not expecting much. But to my suprise and delight this album rules. It is fun, rockin, and a great summer time rock record. With contraband they sounded like STP and GNR got into a car accident and the survivors quickly ran to the nearest studio and put out a half a**'ed attempt at an album. But on Libertead they sound like a real band, and it works well. I would say 90% of the album sounds awesome, with the remaining 10% sounding ok. Scott sounds fantasic, I guess getting clean has done him a lot of good. (It still does not touch the excellence of his STP days but I'll take it.) He is a real rock n' roll MF. peace"
2,Just like the last album - All noise and no melody.,This album sounds exactly like the last album and the last album wasn't very good.Weiland had said that this one was going to be very melodic and more of a concept album and I fail to see any concept too tie the songs together and it is deffinently not melodic.You can barely hear Scott's voice through many of the songs and Slash's solos seem to be misplaced and out of sync with the rest of the music. The drumming keeps it at the same tempo as the last album which is almost always a fast tempo.I think it's time for Stone Temple Pilots to reform. Scott's voice was much better suited to them.Hopefully Scott's second solo album will be out soon.
3,Weak,Repetitive. Same sound as last record. Generic. They keep us waiting this long and this is what they give us? They put no heart into this record.
2,GNR minus Axl Rose,This band is just three guys from GNR that teamed up with a mediocre (at best) singer. The lyrics typically make no sense (just read them and you'll likely get my point).Axl was the true star of GNR. Creating a band that's basically GNR minus Axl creates a problem. After you take away the star singer and performer you end up with just another mediocre band.
3,What I expected,"Pretty good Album. Not amazing, not bad. No Standout Riffs or Solos that will go into the Slash History books, and to be honest, Scott Weiland doesn't really sound like Scott Weiland half the time on most tracks. Better than ""The Spaghetti Incident"" or ""Shangri-La Dee Da,"" if that helps any."
5,Sophomore album is a huge improvement over the first,"VR has really improved their sound since their first release. While Contraband was a solid release, Libertad is a fantastic one. Every song on this album is great. A good mix of hard rockin songs, and slower balad type songs. The sound is very clear and smooth. Slash sounds awesome, even better than he did on VR's previous album. Scott Weiland's vocals are fantastic here as well. He always has such great vocal range. All of the songs are perfect in length too, none too long and drawn out, but none too short and choppy either. Overall, a fantastic album, with no bad songs at all. There is also a neat country-sounding hidden track."
4,A Solid 4-Star Album,"VR's Libertad is a solid hard-rock album from start to finish. I read a comment somewhere that ""Libertad"" feels like 1991 all over again. I agree... but so what? How can anybody expect anything else from these vets? It's a solid rockin' album, in which VR sounds less like GNR and a little more like STP. Scott's vocals stand out as more melodic than in VR's debut ""Contraband"", very reminiscent of STP. Slash's solos and riffs are not protagonistic but rather faint. Slash: we miss you. And that's 1 star down from 5 to 4.Sidenote: Track 14 ""Re-Evolution"" just doesn't belong in any of VR's repertoire. It's clear they have no clue how to Country and they should stay away from that genre. But don't worry, it's kind of a bonus song that doesn't take out much from this overall very good album."
4,An excellent follow up,"Most musicians have a sophmore slump as they try to both duplicate the same sound that was successful on their first release, but be different enough to bring in new listeners. Libertad is filled with musicians who have had far more than two albums, yet fall somewhat into the slump. While the album is solid, the guitar work matched with the vocals is great, there are times, where the band feels trying too hard to have a commercial hit. That being said, the band has grown together. The sounds are more cohesive and do not have to rely on the raw energy of the first release. Instead the band makes stronger music, and more cohesive, paving the way for a amazing third album. Hard rock has become a dying breed in music, and it's great to see some bands still churning out excellent rock music."
2,"Not bad, just...boring.","VR's first album wasn't bad, but it was clear the band had more potential. Unfortunately, that potential may never be realized. Libertad isn't a step backwards, or forwards. In fact, it doesn't really take you anywhere the last album didn't. It's just as bland and riskless as Contraband was, perhaps moreso.I really wanted to like this album. I'd heard it was better than Contraband, but after listening, I just couldn't lie to myself. All the songs sound the same, and all of them are forgettable. It's not that VR is a bad band--everyone in the band is a great musician, but as a whole they don't quite equal the sum of their parts. Just another bland, cookie-cutter rock album from a group that should be capable of delivering much more."
2,Not what you might be looking for,"Although a good rock album overall, Libertad was not what I was looking for at all. I expected something harder than the first album, and didn't get it. It's not a bad album, but it definitely took a few listens to convince me not to return it. I guess I'm too caught up looking for some hard hitting music, and thought this band might provide it. It's definitely more watered down than I thought. I'm sure some will like it, but I think most won't."
1,"Horrible, Terrible, Awful","This is a terrible cd. I wanted to like it. After all, I am a fan of both bands. However, there is no spark. The music is generic, the lyrics are boring. The songs have no hook, no great Slash riffs. There is absolutely not a single redeeming moment on this disc. This is possibly worse than the first Velvet Revolver cd. I don't have enough bad things to say."
1,Whut Were They thinking??,"This is more bland, soulless, corporte rock we are plagued with on a daily basis. These dudes were never any good in Guns N Rozes or STP, so what made them think they'd put out good musik with this band?? I hate this!! For good music, I must recommend Korn, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Kidd Rock and the grooves/beats of some Justin Timberlake songs. On an ending note, go Bengals!! The Cincinnati bengals rule football!!"
4,short and to the point,"If you are an anime fan and don't have the time to see all 50 some episodes, then get this dvd set. It recaps the whole story to the point and deleting unnecessary dialog and other stuff just to fill in for a 30mn air show."
3,its got some good info,i got this when it first came out i didnt like it when i first watched it but ive watched a few more times and its pretty good not the best icp dvd but its got some good interviews with the kings of the juggalo world i think its worth buying
5,Great Item,I gave this cd to my nephew for his 2nd birthday. I'm told that he listens to it over and over and over and over again. It's sure fire way for my sister to cheer him up.
3,Basic Satisfaction!!,"Basically I got what I paid for! I didn't expect hi end cookware for the 49.99 price I paid but I did expect the pans to be a little sturdier than they are. Pretty much the only thing I didn't like was the handles which aren't the best.I made my purchase with the ""throw away pans"" mind set and thats exactly what I got. A decent cheap set that I can use and abuse without having to worry about expense."
4,Excellent book - for adults too!,"My son and I read this aloud when he was 11 (a habit we still occasionally indulge in). It was a fascinating story, and the characters were very alive to us. As stated in other reviews, you should know that this is more than just a story - my son and I discussed much of the book together as we read it, and it made for some very thought provoking discussions. I plan on re-reading it, just for my own pleasure. I'm writing this review tonight while looking for other books she has written - it was that good."
4,X Marks the Spot!,"Yes, there is treasure, but it's been in the house next door for the last hundred years.The elder Smiths decide that's been long enough so they send for the younger Smiths, Jess and Ellsworth. Ellsworth hasn't been to the Smith compound since he was a baby, and Jess's mom decided Jess needed a little holiday while she spent some time with her boyfriend. There's a dark family secret; why Jess's dad split out of there and has never returned, and of course why any family would wait 100 years before going after treasure in the house next door!But the relationship between Jess and Ellsworth and all the wacky Smith family members grows stronger, and Dad does come back to the fold, and everybody holds hands and lives happily ever after.I'm not kidding... They really do."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!,This was a very compelling read and was outstanding!! I love a good mystery and this was perfect!!!
3,It's was disappointing,Burt was great as usual but the writing and acting from the rest of the cast was bad. The scenery is nice though along with the cool cars.
5,This Is The One !!!!!!!,"If you want to get the most out of your Porter Cable 19.2v tools, THIS IS THE BATTERY FOR YOU !! This is an upgrade battery for many of the Porter Cable cordless tools using the 19.2v batteries. You should notice an improvement in run-time and maybe power. Overall performance with the 2.4 ampere hour rated battery has been noticeable to me and I will continue to pay the extra bucks for this replacement battery.(If I ever need another one.) If you have nothing better to do, take a look at my other reviews on 19.2v Porter Cable batteries and you will see why I feel so strongly in favor of this replacement battery."
1,Poter-Cable 19.2v tools,"Even though the PC brand has always been very respected by me, as of late they have really been letting me down. I purchased 2 new batteries exactly 1 year ago and they are already junk, even under light use and complete cycling. The reciprocting saw fell apart, and the circular saw has no lasting power as compared to other brands.Even though I don't want to, I will be replacing them with a different brand, maybe the new Millwaukee or the Ridgid line , as Ridgid offers free replacement batteries for the life of the tool, a definite plus."
1,Junk Batteries,"I've had to replace my charger, and purchase two new batteries (8823 Model) (which lasted only 1 year of minor use). I am very disappointed in this product and Porter Cable will no longer receive my business. The batteries should at least be cheaper if they won't last long. Never again...Porter Cable should be ashamed."
1,You've got to see it to believe it,"And I'm not referring to the script, the actors or the director.This is just a technical review. And truly: it's a unique DVD.It must have taken a very thorough preparation to produce a DVD with an image quality as low as this one. All shadows are a muddy kind of black without any detail visible and all highlights are just completely white, again no detail visible.And for those of us who love the incomparable Raquel: her flawless skin comes in two colors, magenta and green.Yes, the company that has put this DVD on the market has succeeded in eliminating skin-tones! Applause!"
3,Good but cheap,"these head phones give off good sound, but they're not durable, i've brought two pairs of these headphones the first pair, the right ear stopped working, and the 2nd pair was same model, but the prong piece was different, it was a very stupid design, but anyway, that part had wires that was easily exposed, so they got damaged quick. Other than that, they sounded good, and they lasted for a good while"
3,Jury is Still Out,"I followed directions exactly with this product but did not see any significant hair reduction. Since then I've been using it once a day (evenings) for about 2 weeks. It seems like my regrowth is coming in finer now, so maybe over time it will stop completely, as advertised. One thing I like is that this product does not irritate my sensitive skin. I'm willing to keep using it as long as I'm seeing progress."
1,It didn't work !,"I followed the directions; however, it did not work. Hair kept growing at the same ol' rate. This product is definately overpriced. The spray pump nozzle even didn't work. It kept sticking in the down position."
1,Near-death experience,"What did I expect for $14? It was OK at first. Occasionally only pinching my ears where the two plastic pieces joined. Then it started making some weird humming noise. One day it made a loud pop, and gave me some sort of electric shock through the eardrums. Luckily, it only took one motion to rip it off my head and toss it in the trash."
3,Enjoyable But Forgettable,"I'm really big on technical death metal. I love the talent that shines through each band member, the time signature changes, and how the songs tend to refuse formulatic song writing. I found Crimson Massacre after a recommendation, and after listening to the album a few times, I must say that this band definitely has the talent of a technical death metal band, it just that the band's songs just don't leave an impression in my head. The problem with the songs are that they lack cohesion and focus. As much as I love to hear chaotic sweeps and riffs, they just don't quite do it for me.This is not a bad album by any means, as I do quite enjoy listening to it from time to time. However, if you are beginning to get into technical death metal, I don't recommend this as a starter. ""The Luster of Pandemonium"" is only for those who are fixated with the genre, and for better starter bands, I'd recommend Spawn of Possession and Necrophagist instead."
1,Anyone who thinks this is good is on somthing.,"Oh ya, this is the best guitar playing Ive ever heard on this masterpeace, Better the Van Halen. Give me a break. You are smokin it. The guitar playing on this is among the worst Ive ever heard. If You wanna hear real Guitar Get Van Halen 1, It blows this junk away. This cd hasnt even gone gold. Get in to real music, dont wast your time on this. I enjoy Some of the final Fantacy Games, But a sound track? Get into reality, this is far below average. The Black Mages, What Kind of name is that anyway, man."
5,Astonishing! Amazing !,"This is my fisrt time here but ,in spite my bad english, i must write about this soberb book about manegement. Everythng one should know about a profitable business is there. simple, direct and a clean style. Since the first page it's hard to avoid reading until the last one.This book should be at every business library.Roberto Flores[...]"
2,havent received yet,Well I have not received the product yet but ok...Still waiting the book...why is this taking so long?
1,Be careful what you ask for.,You can use this book to cut your costs and expand your profits...for a time. Then the costs will come back with a vengance. Some of these slash and burn methods are merely a mortgage on your future. You and your people will pay a big price when the loan comes due. This stuff looks great until you examine the long-term implications. Others of his suggestions make sense and are things you should do. That's the good news. The bad news is that it can be difficult to sort out the good ideas from the bad. It would be a much more useful (and safer) book if the author told you how to make safe choices.
5,Listening and then some,"Okay...Now I havent even heard the entire CD yet, but Im HOOKED!Phonte's delivery is SICK!!!!! Who would have thought that the Carolina's could deliver this gem. Maybe these brothers can help save Hip-hop! Lord knows it needs some help."
4,Nicenest to the fullest,1 of the best debut albums to date. 9th's wonderfull beats is bringing hip hop back to the roots. And phonte is one of the most talneted cats in the game
2,Average,"Album starts strong with ""Groupie Pt. 2"", continues smoothly through ""For You"", ""Speed"" and ""Whatever you say"" then this album falls off totally. It's really bad when an artist does this, because they know what their best tracks are. You'll either find them right at the start of an album like this release or spread through-out to fill up the gaps.A ""fair"" album to just put on in the background while you're unconscience but without one single memorable track that's worth a repeat this album does not warrant all these 5 star ratings it's getting. I smell new-to-underground fans feeling these mainstream sounds far too much."
5,Little Brother are the Future,"Damn, i copped this disc last week and it has to be one of the greatest most underrated Hip Hop joints to come out in years. I am a huge fan of the way Pete Rock and DJ Premier go about there production and 9th Wonder is now officially in that league. No need for a Fast forward button when listening to this, Phonte and Big Pooh hold their Own over 9th's Melodic, head nodding production. My Fav joints are ""Groupie Pt 2"", ""For You"" and ""Whatever you say"" but all tracks are well above average unlike most of current Hip Hops album fillers. Every Hip Hop fan must cop this so dont sleep!! HOLLA"
4,THANK GOD,"The track ""The way you do it"" is my fav, It's about time someone good came out of NC. TO EVERYONE, CHECK OUT PREECH, and the albim ,MY REALITY! its hot"
5,PUSH PLAY AND LET IT RIDE! NO SKIPPABLE TRACKS! NO FILLER!,"im going to keep this review short,simple and to the pointyes believe the hype. Lil brother is reminiscent of tribe and de la, hence the name ""little brother"" because they feel that they are the younger brothers of those respected groups. 9th wonder established himself as a top notch producer, jay-z even gives him props as the future(jay usually has good taste in producers)LISTEN THERE ARE NO SKIPPABLE TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!! HOW RARE IS IT THAT YOU CAN LISTEN TO A ALBUM IN ITS ENTIRETY! most hip hop albums have 5 good songs and the rest are trash. The listening is timeless music. You can bump this 5 years from now and get the same feeling. How many rap records can you say you still listen to that you got even 5 months ago!this was the best album of 2003 and in my opinion the best album of the new millenium thus far!!!IF YOU WANT TO HEAR AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD HIP HOP, THEN BUY THIS ALBUM!!"
5,Amazing 9th woner is the greatest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"pure example of where smooth underground hip hop is going a must own!!!!!!! no joke you need this album it brightens my day when i listen to it i love pooh phonte and wonder you guys are true to hip hop you will like this cd if you are a fan of A tribe called quest, Common Sense, Mos Def and Talib Kweli this one is for anyone not just people who enjoy smooth hip hop buy it now10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats"
4,2003's Best New Hip Hop Group,"This is an album that will be talked about when they drop their 2nd album or 3rd (which ever breaks through) but it will be remembered. Little Brother are the little brothers of real hip hop (I hate that term lemm go back), of ol' skool hip hop groups like Tribe, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth and Leaders of The New. Matter of fact, this album sits alongside of them as future classics and lessons of how to do hip hop and be proud after the mastering of the disc. The production is handled by member 9th Wonder and the M.C.'s are damn near perfect group member M.C.'s (you know not too boastful, not too underground). They make anyone who loves Hip Hop music, rather Underground or Overground or plain ass crap-ground, like this CD. That what a hip hop album is suppose to be made of."
3,"Good, but overrated","Let me begin by saying that I do like this album. The rhymes are pretty tight, and the production is above-average (although not great).But let's not kid ourselves, folks. This is not Tribe Called Quest. This is not Slum Village. This is a young, talented group that needs to tighten up everything (and get some iller beats) before they can step up and play with the big boys. Everyone's talking like this album is the second coming of Christ, when it's just a mediocre/decent album.I hope they get better, but I'm not recommending this to anyone."
2,I've stopped Listening.,"It's interesting that so many people find this album prophetic and remarkable. Before purchasing the album, I glanced a few of the other reviews for The Listening. With the reviews people gave, I racked my brain as to why I hadn't heard of Little Brother before. After listening to the album, the explanation quickly formalized as to why these guys were so unknown. Sure, Little Brother sounds remarkable if you're taking a break from listening to the average materialistic Rap artist stuck in the gutter of materialism, but compared to the current Hip-Hop talent out there, these guys can't even compare. Even their title song, routinely the most impressive of an album, The Listening was average at best, and only conveyed the message that every other artist tries to convey throughout their albums."
3,"As 9th Wonder goes, so goes ""The Listening""","First off, that annoying ""BAM! The future of hip-hop music!"" thing that plays at every interlude dropped this album a full star for me. Real corny.While MCs Phonte and Big Pooh can hold their own, and deliver memorable verses on songs like ""Speed"" and ""The Yo-Yo,"" this album goes only as far as producer 9th Wonder will take it. 9th makes beats with a sound similar to Pete Rock or Ali Shaheed Muhammad, EXCEPT his drums don't hit NEARLY as hard. This album did not live up to the internet hype it seems to get. I can get into about half the songs, with ""Whatever You Say,"" ""The Yo-Yo,"" and ""Shorty on the Lookout"" being my favorites."
2,NOT GOOD!,"There is a lot of hype on this album, I ve heard so many people say that this can be one of the best underground hip hop albums of the year....are you kidding me? I coped this album, maybe expecting too much and absolutley hated it. The beats are terrible, the lyrics are dry and there is nothing original or unique about these guys. If I were to give props to one of the best hip hop cds this year, it would be ""heiruspecs"", ""Brother Ali"", or ""gift of gab"" NOT Little brother!"
4,ok,the ends were the screws go in are arent flat so you cant bend it because the bar will break other than that it was ok
1,handheld sudoku,"Flimsy, instructions that are incomprehensible. It looks great but is impossible to use. It will either be thrown away or returned, if I can figure out how to do it!"
2,"A dud, I'm sad to say","PLEASE don't let this be your introduction to the Black Adder series. It should only be purchased by completists, as it is the weakest of the bunch. But even as the weakest it rates more than one star, because the series is so excellent. Indeed, at its peak (years 2, 3, and 4), Black Adder is about as funny as TV gets. Alas, this one just doesn't cut it. Atkinson is not at his best, and the usually delightful Baldrick is WAY off his usual form (he actually looks and sounds ill). You'll get this with the complete DVD collection (which I highly recommend), though I'm pretty sure this would be your least-watched of the discs."
4,You have to be a real idiot if you don't like this,"Edmumd Black Adder becomes a ""Timelord"". This would be twice for Black Adder star Rowan Atkinson after appearing as the Doctor in the Doctor Who Comedy Relief ""The Curse of Fatal Death"". I found this new installment of the Black Adder series to be very amusing with finds Edmund Black Adder and Balderick traveling through time in a make shift time machine. And making a mess of everything. Regulars to the series Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and Miranda Richardson all return and are wonderful in multiple roles. Stephen Fry's best scene in the movie is as the Duke of Wellington during his famous victory against Napoleon. You'll also notice the lack of a laugh track in this episode. I found that to be very refreshing in a televison comedy. But I recommend this video highly for those who have only seen Rowan as ""Mr. Bean"". ""Black Adder"" is both very intelligent and sophmoric at the same time."
4,Excellent nostalgia,"If you've seen all four BlackAdder series you might look at this film and think a few things. One: Some folks haven't aged well at all. Two: Wow, this is a little on the slow paced side. Three: This is pretty damn funny.Yes, it's the the best Blackadder effort (but then again it wasn't really meant to be), but it's fun. You find yourself remembering how funny the original series were and it makes you want to pull out your old tapes (yes I said tapes, I haven't gotten the dvds yet) and watch them.Remember whichever Blackadder you first started watching is no doubt your favorite. I've seen people recommending Blackadder III, but Blackadder II was my favorite, followed by I, III and IV.Viva le Blackadder!"
1,All Blackadder fans - STAY AWAY,"There's nothing to see here, and what there is will put you off Blackadder forever. This...celeb cameo-athon was put together for the Millennium Dome - and boy does it show. There is no heart, no passion and most of all, no comedy in this extremely short film. How it can even be released as a stand-alone DVD is beyond me. Suffice to say, I have lost a little more respect for the previous shows through watching this. It retired young and really should have stayed in the shadows, Greta Garbo-style."
2,Only 55 minutes - including special features!,"I should have looked more carefully at the reviews. $15.99 for what is essentially one episode of a 1/2 hour TV show is monstrous. I was taken in by the Black Adder V title. Silly me, I'd assumed that since all the other numbered Black Adder DVD's were whole series DVD's, this would be likewise. What a rip-off, Amazon."
3,"OK, but Short, Odd and not all that Funny","This is a special episode of Black Adder made several years after the regular series/program ended. It brings back most of the main actors. The episode here only lasts about 30 minutes - it is not really a new series.I thought it was OK, but kind of odd and not all that funny. Black Adder and Baldrick travel through time in the time machine that Baldrick somehow put together that actually works. Baldrick forgets to label the controls, so they have a hard time getting back to present time. Baldrick's ""cunning plan"" in this episode actually works which finally gets them home.I'd say fans of Black Adder can take this one or leave it."
3,Not up to Blackadder's high standard,"When you get blackadder you expect to be great. So this is a bit of a let down from its very high standards. But its still has its funny moments and compared to some other comedys around. But just dont expect the normal high standards of Blackadder and use your money on something else 1st. Oh and this is not really a series 5, it's a one off programme for the millenium."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I'm sorry to force my opinion on you but you must stay clear of this. It's really cringeworthy when you consider that the other four series (if you call this - a short, haphazard, rush job - a 'series') are all masterpieces. Ok, perhaps the first one is a flawed masterpiece. Nevertheless, it really was a moment of madness on the part of the writers and is as painful as seeing Mohammed Ali struggle to walk when he was once an irresistable fighter and statesman. So go buy the DVD Boxset instead of this lethargic, uninspired, hackneyed waste of time - I guarantee you'll have no regrets in doing so."
2,Strictly for Ardent fans,"I am the biggest fan of the blackadder there is (including three email addresses entitled blackadder), but this video is for the fan who waxes nostalgic. If you have every thing else by all means purchase this if you (like myself) always crave more of Lord Blackadder. On the other hand, this is not the place to start, in fact it is rather disappointing, better to get the complete collection and the Christmas special first."
1,I couldn't even finish watching.,"Having seen the entire TV series, I rented from netflicks out of curiousity. This was nothing more than a masturbatory reveling in BA, Atkinson and Co.'s past glories. The clever character sarcasm and artistic melding of slapstic and intelligent humour is simply absent here. I was disappointed with this, and glad that Laurie moved on to win Emmy's in Dr. House, and Atkinson went on to Bean and Johnny English (both were great). But this, this is just plain crud. Don't buy."
3,"Not the best, but still worthwhile","Back and Forth isn't nearly as acerbic as the earlier installments (with the possible exception of BAI), and some of the lines suffer from poor timing. Additionally, I got the impression that in some places, the writers were trying to spell out the implied jokes in order to appeal to stupid people. If you've never seen Black-Adder before, do not buy this--buy Black Adder III, or if you have surplus funds (send them to me or), buy the complete series. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it, and I think it would be worthwhile for other diehard Black-Adder fans."
1,A waste of money,"Though this tape costs about as much as the normal tapes, it contains only 1 half-hour episode. Back and Forth starts out slow, and never picks up the pace. There were several (two I think) places where I actually laughed. Other than that I found the show pretty lame...Black Adder punched Shakespeare to punish him for his having to read his plays...Queen Elizabeth likes the taste of breath mints...I'm sorry but that's a pretty poor excuse for comedy.Don't waste your money on this yawner! Two thumbs down!"
2,Women's life in greece,"I had wanted the third edition, but was sent the second. I am not sure if it is VERY different or if i did not read the description clearly, but I still need the book for class"
5,Foyles war 2,The order was filled promptly and delivery was ahead of promised time. The quality of material was excellent
5,Excellent series,"This is an excellent series. It has everything--drama, suspense, and great acting. It is the story of a local British law officer and his experiences during the war. I've watched it on PBS several times."
5,Excellent Series,"Set 2 continues the excellent series of Foyle's War. Relationships continue to evolve between Michael Kitchen, Honeysuckle Weeks, and Anthony Howell. Highly recommended."
4,Foyle's War Edition 2,"This is a typical British TV production where more care is given to nuanced acting than pretty faces. If you are looking for gory murders or chase scenes - forget it. If you are looking for characterizations that make the actors seem like your family, then this is the series to watch. Intelligence supercedes brawn."
5,Wonderful series,"I first encountered this series while living in England. I was delighted to find it available through Amazon Prime. This series is grounded in historical accuracy, is extremely well-acted and well-written. The issues and hardships endured by the English people during WWII are very fairly represented, and the story lines are believable. I highly recommend the whole series."
5,An English Columbo,"I am at the end of the series which I have enjoyed. Takes place in WW11 England. A detective that solves murders during war time in townships around the London area. He is very understated his eyes tell you alot. About a minute worth of lead up to what the episode consists of ( of course there's alway more to the story) credits the then appx. 1 !/2 hr. episode starts. The homes, castles ,cottages and generally whole countryside is beautiful. Era autos, very proper detective, serious and funny. A very well done period piece series"
4,"a terrific series, but marred by prejudice","I have been a fan of this series from the beginning, and while I agree with most viewers that the"
5,"Yes, men and women are different!!! Let's celebrate it!","This is such a fun book to read and I can't wait for the ""How to run your business like a mother"" to come out. ( I have a husband and a adorable five year old).I so relate to these stories. Not only we run our business differently, we also get treated differently by clients, vendors , etc...This book gives some great tips on how to run your business better!"
2,Don't buy it,"It seems like the author is embracing unpreparedness is in this book. I thought this book will be insightful but the book keeps referring to entrepreneurs who didn't have a clue when they started the business. Why is being unprepared so popular? I was not happy with this book. So if you want some good information read ""Entrepreneur's Toolkit."" Here is the link http://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Toolkit-Techniques-Business-Essentials/dp/1591394368/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333769538&sr=1-1"
4,Great Book For Women in Business,"I really liked the case studies written here and the concept that there is no one way to run your business. As a woman business owner, we tend to do things a little differently. I loved the perspectives given here."
5,Could it happen today?,"Read this book, if you can find a copy. Buy a used copy, borrow it from someone, or obtain a copy of this book at your local library. It's a fairly fast read, and riveting. A novel, yes ... but you can't help but wonder, ""Could it happen today? In the 21st Century?"" I encourage high school English teachers to not only read this book, but find a way for their class to read it and discuss it. This book is (IMHO) a modern day classic. The implications, lessons, and warnings inherent in this story are applicable, even today ... decades after the story was set in a fictitious small town in New Hampshire in the late '60's. Topics that could be discussed and touched on are: bullies, extortion, and the expression: ""All that is needed for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing."" For a good scare that will leave you pondering human nature: READ THIS BOOK!"
4,recommend,"durable, high quality drill, after 3 years of use the unit has held up, and I would recommend it over a dewalt 14.4 volt. I install cable and phone lines and am very satisfied with the performance (concrete, wood, brick etc)"
2,PC 14.4 Driver Drill,"Purchased this tool 2 1/2 years ago to replace an aged Makita and used it lightly for home remodel and weekend projects. I'd say it has been a very good tool, but recently the clutch died despite the fact I rarely changed the setting. It also had the tendency for the chuck to loosen up during use and drop the bit despite being well tightened. I'm disappointed with the durability."
5,With small amount of light at night you can see at night! These are the finest german persision engineering sure you can pay 5,With small amount of light at night you can see at night! These are the finest german persision engineering sure you can pay 5 times the price for the crystal maker german lens but why?I use these for 2 hours in the day and night too watch soccer - kid at college. Also use them at night too watch my dog when it is too dark - ya - they kind of work like night vision with minor ambient light - house lamps or good moon light.i can see perfect across our 30 acre lake and 2000 yards into yards.why pay more? why pay less? got my for $200 used on the fee way place!
3,Not tripod adaptable,"Center sharpness is excellent. The center shows no chromatic aberration looking at a known challenging target--a certain gray building in sunlight. Getting towards the edge the image gets softer and there is purple fringing in my challenging test. Resistance to lens flare is very good. Very above average, but not quite 5 star.The individual focus provides mechanical simplicity that makes it easier to make these water resistant and study than center focus binoculars. For distant subjects that require little or no refocusing, it is a good system. For closer, more animated subjects it is not. I would not recommend these for birdwatching if there are good center focus binoculars available instead.Considering that this is otherwise well suited for distant, static targets, it seems like a serious omission to have no socket for a tripod adapter."
3,High Performance??????????????,"I think not. These things are very big. They make great ear warmers. As for being high performance, nah. They're no better than any other low budget headphones out there. They're cheaply made and just a big waste of money. Sorry. I thought I was getting a product that was...lets see...high performance. For the price I wasn't expecting BOSE quality and sound but good grief, I wasn't expecting garbage either. Sorry. Spend a few extra dollars and get a better product."
5,Very clear sound and balance of frequencies..,"So, the first thing I noticed was the clear separation of the frequencies in the audio spectrum.. I was listening to some rock music and you could clearly hear where each tom had been panned. Never has this been heard with any of my other head phones. Most headphones I've used, just made everything sound muddy and discombobulated. Next is the bass, the bass is easily audible, while not to loud and not to soft, you'll get a great sound without too much distortion.. Lastly, these headphones are very comfortable. Ignore the reviewers complaining about your ears sweating. I've had them on for over an hour now and no sweating has occurred. Maybe they're just in a hot room? Overall, for $4 ($8 After shipping) you cannot go wrong with these headphones. If you're looking for something unbelievable, then I would say it's safe to assume you're gonna have to pay a little more than $8! However, you cannot go wrong with these headphones."
3,"Good sound, extremely poor build","I would rate this headphones two and a half stars in my honest opinion it has good sound quality, its able to keep a lot of distortion out of bass, though the bass level compared to a pair of good DJ headphones is about quarter of that but the worst part (which isnt that bad but picky people that are making reviews will explode on it) the entire thing is made from cheap plastic, I havent broke them yet but i have dropped them a few good times on concrete and they hold up really well but when you hold it in your hand it feels like if you shake it ill fall apart. One of the best parts about these headphones is the cushions, they are really conferrable and i could wear them for hours but i bought these head phones looking for a pair that will hold tight on my head and cancel a lot of noise but these ill not cancel all the noise while off..... but when you turn the music up these headphones are good at getting a lot of house noise outhope i helped u:P"
3,"Awful sound, but very inexpensive","These headphones have an awful boxy sound, with no mids whatsoever, and lots of weird things happening with the high frequencies. This makes it unusable for any mixing purposes, and not ideal for listening to music. However, it has decent sound isolation, and is comfortable enough, so it gets use as tracking monitors in the studio. It's also dirt cheap, so I suppose it's OK for the price..."
1,Horrible,These were a present for my son and he used them one day and they stopped working in the middle of listening to a song and we couldn't get them to work again. I was very disappointed. If I knew that they would match the price to the quality then I would have just went to the store and bought a cheap pair that would have lasted longer.
1,TRASH ON YOUR EARS,HEADPHONES ARE VERY LOW. THE MATERIAL LOOKS AND FEELS VERY CHEAP. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT HAS A STUDIO. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
3,"Nice bass 4 the price,but a bit big.","Its pretty big, im 275 6'0 and I dont need to extend them at all, in fact even the smallest notch istill feels a little losse."
1,HORRIBLE,They feel like they are going to break. and when music is played with them it sounds like pure s***. Its a crackling sound so loud you cant hear what your listening to. HORRIBLE BUY!!!
2,Cheapo headphones,These headphones are not very good. Very cheaply made--one ear doesn't work unless you wiggle the cord around. The sound is okay I guess and the volume knobs on the actual headphones are nice for recording music in our home studio but the quality of these headphones is VERY low...
5,My husband loves these headphones.,"I bought these for my husband to listen to Bible CD's that I loaded onto our iPod. He has some hearing loss in one ear and with the regular earbuds he could only hear in his good ear. With these headphones, he can hear in both ears and he really likes that. They sound pretty good with music, but are great with the book format. I personally do not care for the large around the ear sytle headphones, but he does not mind them and says that outside factors are less distracting to him when he has these on. He did not care for the earbud style headphones. The price was amazingly low and they work for our needs."
3,Adequate for Work - Not Adequate for Coldplay,"I purchased these headphones to listen to monthly training topics on my computer at work. To expect fidelity out of something like this is silly. When I purchased these headphones about a year ago, they were under six bucks. What I needed was the sound isolation (so my co-workers didn't have to hear my training session) and reasonable short-term comfort. For those to requirements, these headphones are fine. I would never listen to Mylo Xyloto with these. The headpones I own (still the CV320) has volume controls on each earcup, which differs from the unit pictured by Amazon.com. Oh...and even after 20 minutes of listening to online training, just as some other reviews have already stated, my ears start to sweat...which is gross. Bottom line. If you buy cheap headphones you will typically get cheap sound. All I needed was ""sound"" and that is just what I got."
3,Coby Headphones,"Vendor had a good price. I use headphones every day at work. These are good quality for my purposes, and hold up well under daily use. They are comfortable and the sound quality is OK for casual listening."
2,This is the smallest toy ever! Not worth 19.99! Fit's in my the palm of my hand!,Very disappointed in this toy. There was no indication that this toy was small. Once I got it ... well... it's as big as the palm of my hand. I hope it doesnt' get lost under the tree!
5,Stampp on Reconstruction,"A cohesive and well-written account of Reconstruction by a world-renowned historian. Stampp does not present a flowing narrative of historical events, rather he gives his own revisionist perspective on the policies of both the Johnson administration and the Radical Republicans. An excellent work of scholarship, accessible to both the student and those with a general interest in American history - Thoroughly recommended."
4,A Solid History of Reconstruction,"What amazed me the most about this book by Kenneth Stampp is its readability. The book is suprisingly entertaining despite what some may consider its dry subject matter. Although, some of the revisionist ideas of Mr. Stampp have been taken to task by recent historians, The Era of Reconstruction still remains one of the essential tools for any student of American history.Mr. Stampp can perhaps be taken to task for some of the far-fetched psychological connections he makes when trying to surmise the motiviations of historical personages, most notably Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, but the fact that Stampp used psychology in his historical speculations is remarkable because of the fact that his work was written in the mid sixties. By delving deeper than any historian before him into the motivations behind reconstruction, Stampp's work remains fresh and readable even today."
3,Stampp no more valid than Dunning,"I have read the books by Stampp, Foner, Dubois, and Dunning and find that each of them has hold of a part of the history of the ""elephant"" (as in the blind men trying to describe something) known as Reconstruction. Dunning and his ""Dunning School"" on the subject was academically and historically accurate and cannot be discredited, but neither can Stampp be challenged on his attempt to revise the history of the ""tragic decade"" and the scar left behind by the attempt to reconstruct the southern states in the image of the ""radical"" members of Congress and the United States military. However, Stampp comes to the subject matter with his own bias and prejudices based on ethnicity and ""liberal"" politically-correct scholarship. The ""elephant"" was long gone before any of these writers described Reconstruction 1865-1877, so all we can do in the name of intellectual honesty is read them all with the awareness thatStampp is no more valid than Dunning."
5,most comprehensive look yet,"This is the most comprehensive summary of dualist religious topics I have come by so far. Where alternative religious theory/history is a popular subject these days, this book does a fine job in exposing the reader not only to mainstream thought, but every branch and vein possible. The author has truly done his research.I found it the most informative book on the subject matter yet and have learned more than I had expected.Yes, there is a lot of detail, but that is what makes this book so fascinating."
2,"tedious, uninformative","This book is a republished old version with a new name. It is tedious. It is written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective, and provides absolutely no new information on the subject. It is obsessed with Balkan and Byzantine history, and seems only dimly informed by modern Manichean and Gnostic studies. A big let down."
5,The most complete history of Dualism available,"This book covers everything any sane person would ever want to know about dualism. I realize that if you are reading a book like this you are probably like me and not actually sane yourself. Nevertheless this is the most interesting and comprehensive book on dualism I have yet read. However, be warned this book is not for the faint of heart. I never thought I would read a book by a Bulgarian who has a bigger vocabulary than I do.(not that I am a sesquipedalian individual by any stretch of the imagination) This is not an easy read but it is well worth your time."
2,A very dense read...,This book is full of very interesting information on the early dualist religions but it is extremely difficult reading both theologically and linguistically. Definitely not for the casual reader.
3,Hope it is better than the orginal...,"The charger is the weak link in the PC battery powered tools chain. The orginal charger gave out in six months and I purchased this one to replace it. So far, so good, no problems. I sent the orginal back to PC but have yet to hear from them about repairing it. I am not a heavy user but like to leave the charger plugged in on my bench, that doesn't seem to be a good idea."
2,Porter Cable - Get Back to the Drawing Board,Love Porter Cable tools but their battery chargers leave much to be desired. It is not really a smart charger. You can not leave it on indefinatly. Battery heats up & in my case melted. This is a potential fire problem. Most decent chargers have an on switch & they automaticlly shut off when the battery is fully charged.
1,Charger is junk!!,"I'm going on the third charger in 3 years. I'm not happy with it at all. PC will do nothing. Love the drill and saw, but will NEVER but PC cordless anything again! Im an electrician, so i use this stuff daily. Hope this helps you stay away from PC cordless tools."
2,Porter-Cable products,"I have always used Porter-Cable products until they started to produce their tools overseas. My charger also burned out and had to buy another. The way to remedy this situation is to charge the battery then unplug the charger. Once this drill takes a crap, I'll be looking to replace my cordless with ANYTHING but Porter-Cable!"
2,Not the right quaility,"The 19.2 Sawboss that I use the batteries for is great and it's my favorite saw. Now as far as the charger goes it dies after 6-9 months. Now when plugged in it is totally dead and charges nothing, just plain dead. This is my third charger in a few years. I expect higher quality from the old Porter Cable of which now has cheapened up it's entire line making this charger and battery system I need obsolete. I don't know if leaving it plugged in too long is a issue? I like to charge the battery overnight and return in the morning to a fully charged battery, not a dead battery & worthless charger."
1,P\C Charger,The Porter Cable cordless tools are great. The chargers are crap. Bought one to replaced the one that crapped out that came w\the drill. Lasted 6 months. Good luck getting P\C to take care of it. Will be purchasing Makita cordless tools from now on.
2,Major issues,We received this kit in about 8 weeks. We decided to open it on Christmas Eve to put it together. It did not come with any stands. We also have to drill holes in order to afix the Tom drums. Not very good at this because we have never put together a drum kit. There we few missing items as well. Did not work out well for us at all as we were trying to inspire or Rock Band drummer to get on a set of real drums.
3,Buyer beware,"We bought these without much knowledge of drum kits and hardware. The drums themselves...the wood part...did NOT have holes for the attachments. We had to drill through the color ""metallic"" finish to place holes. There were barely any directions for assembly, and nothing to indicate that you would need to drill holes from the product description. We ended up calling a friend and googling to be able to have it user ready for Christmas morning. Our daughter's drum instructor told us later that the sale price was high once we explained to him what we had bought."
5,One of my favorite tools!,"I pour over this book and another Brenda Kinsale title, ""40 Over 40"", twice a year at seasonal wardrobe evaluation time. Her advice is so solid, and her tone so supportive. My look has imporved greatly since I started studying her advice. My favorite is ""Don't save anything for ""best"". There is no ""best"". Now I go a head and wear my nice clothes any old time and feel much better for it."
3,Some Good Parts,"Especially at the beginning there is a lot of excess annoying chattiness in this book that I could have done without, but then there are a few good parts. For example, more useful is the chapter with the shopping calendar. I have been ripping the book apart to focus on the better parts. Gone is the chapter on tattoos. Keeping the chapter on clothing capsules."
3,she's done better,"This book is okay - a little cute, but some interesting ideas. However, I read Kinsel's Brenda's Wardrobe Companion first, and found that one much better."
1,Waste of time and money,"A book like this should be something you would keep and refer back to - this went right in my recycle bin. Extremely disappointing. The only thing that was new or helpful in the least was the suggestion to look for clothing in colors that were reflected in your eyes, hair etc. Other then that I cannot think of anything. Pretty much a waste of time and money. I felt the same way about her 'Over 40' book that I also foolishly bought."
1,this stuff is super-cooliciaticly-macadocious tight!,i really liked this album. it's super-cooliciaticly-macadocious tight
3,Wonderful Movie but I missed the Christopher Guest Cast,"I thought the movie rated well; however, I was psyched out to see some of the Christopher Guest cast in this ""mockumentary,"" but none of the Guest cast showed up, and I could see each one of them in the different roles. Imagine seeing Fred Willard as a Real Estate Agent with a chain saw...etc.Anyway, kudos to the wonderful job the writers, producers, directors and actors did. Everyone did a supurb job, and I hope to see these producers do some more mockumentaries in the future. It seems as if they have their own cast, so I will be looking forward to seeing them in the future. You give Guest and cast a good run for the money. Thanks for the great entertainment on the fourth of July weekend."
5,Hysterical!,"One of the funniest, quirkiest ""real life"" type movies I've seen in a long time-It takes a while to really get moving but when it does the humor really pays off-April Barnett and Cedric Yarborough-Tamika and Bobby especially had me in stitches! Highly recommended."
3,Good.,"I was very pumped up for this DVD for a long time, especially after seeing Anthrax twice on the WCFYA tour. But I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this when I finally got so see it. The set list is great, but the overall look and sound of the DVD just doesn't capture Anthrax's live energy. They are one of the best bands to go see live; no BS pyrotechnics or big ""rock & roll show"" garbage, just a raw high energy show. Somehow the DVD just doesn't do them justice."
1,hmm!,"the dvd is pretty good dvd but very far from best live performancethis band need to break up before no one want to buy their record aynmore,c'mon volume8 sold 120.000, wcfya only 50.000this band turn into undergroun , better break up now!"
2,susan hayward,"I Just Love Susan Haywood as an Actress,I think she's one of the best of all times,but this would be the worse movie I have ever seen her in.But as they say EACH TO THEIR OWN"
1,Do not purchase,"These are BCI Eclipse LLC productions. Navarre Corporation acquired BCI Eclipse, LLC last year, so hopefully they can make these a bit better. BCI also producted El Candidato, which was a mess of a DVD. Very Choppy and poor quality. Un Nuevo Amor as a bit better thatn El Candidato but VERY far from the quality of Laguna Films.I'm afraid that BCI/Navarre have these coming out later this year to DVD, I guess we will see if they improve production. If not, I suggest everyone send an email to the company or just stop buying their products because their is no reason for this poor quality.SonarasTodo Por AmorNada Personal"
5,thanks for the product,thank you for a very good product that was received without any kind of distruction and plays very well.
2,Disappointing,I haven`t seen this telenovela on tv and was very anxious but what a disappointment! It started very good and seeemed to be very interesting and then there`s that huge gap. What happened to all these people from the first part? You get some answers f. e. that Valentina killed Estrella but why? As far as the summary goes they hardly knew each other. What happened to Santiagos wife and daughter? What about Valentinas daughters?... All in all I regret buying the dvd and should better have bought the whole novela. Unfortunately that takes a lot of time and that`s the reason I have bought summaries and probably will continue doing so. I sincerly hope they won`t release more like this than they allready have (Golpe bajo & El candidato are the same!)
5,Best Andromeda Ever!,"Just faaaaantastic stuff!! I wasn't into Kevin Sorbo or anything, but Vare and Morris have made me an Andromeda fan for life. For life!! Great unique plot, especially for a science fiction book. I just hope that the next one will follow the Broken Places in this new direction."
1,The Broken Places - Kindle Edition,"The author does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the Andromeda cast. I liked how she worked in the backstory of Beka's mother and the Genite origins. I would give the book from 4 to 5 stars if it was not for the lack of editing. The typos for this book was the worst I have ever read. Character names changed from paragraph to paragraph, both the Andromeda and the Eureka Maru were often misspelled. The poor editing spoiled my reading experience. It became a labor to read the book."
2,"Not a ""How To"" book","Falls short if you are looking for a step by step guide on how to implement a Home Network. Very little discussion about statis IP connections, using routers or printservers.Primarily includes descriptions of various technologies as well as advantages and disavantages.Troubleshooting section consists of recommendations to contact someone who knows networking and references to websites to go to for assistance."
5,Deodato 2,"I've been a Deodato fan for a long, long time. This particular CD was a ""must buy"" for me, as I'd worn out the vinyl! I could listen to ""Super Strut"" unendingly. John Tropea is a virtuoso on guitar throughout."
2,Misleading Title,"As someone who doesn't have a CLUE about the Bible, I thought such a title would be a good start and I love Joyce Meyer. I figure just buying a Bible, a lot would go over my head. I know JM has a Theological degree and clearly knows a lot. I was hoping for a basic over-view for some context. Does that make sense?I expected it to be for new people with ""John talks about this"" and ""the Old Testament is this compared to the New Testament being that"". ""Dealing with death you should study this"". I mean, what's ""Numbers"" and what's ""Acts""? why do they have such titles and who wrote them compared to James and John etc getting direct credit? Hey I told you I didn't have a clue so back off! ;-)anyway....this was more like her regular show and not for a newbie trying to figure out what's what. It was fine but not at ALL what the title implies."
5,Rat-astrophe...,"Legendary mega-star, Marjoe Gortner headlines this tale of vermin gone colossal. Based (extremely loosely) on the H.G. Wells story of the same name, FOOD OF THE GODS is another nature-strikes-back movie w/ giant grubs, titanic chickens, humongous wasps, and hippo-sized rats! All these creatures have been dining on grain soaked in a strange substance that bubbles up from beneath the ground. Ida Lupino (The Devil's Rain) is the farmer's wife who knows what's going on. Pamela Franklin (Legend Of Hell House, Satan's School For Girls) and Belinda Balaski (Piranha, Gremlins, The Howling) also star. Watch for the giant chicken encounter, as it is fabulously hysterical! The swarms of terribly filmed wasps are great as well! As for the rats, I actually felt sorry for the hordes of rodents that were shot, burned, blown up, and drowned! I so wanted them to eat Gortner's head! Oh well..."
3,A Giant Hit,"Good old Bert I Gordon still thinks it is the 50's. This time,instead of radiation, giant G.I.'S and rock'n'roll hating spiders,here is a tale of what happens when man messes with nature.Marjoe Gortner gets stuck on an island over-run by all sorts of giantmice, wasps, even chickens!A farmer discovers a growth hormone and feeds it to his livestock withpredictable results. A good fun movie with Gordon's trademarksuper-imposed photographic effects which hold a certain charm in thesedays of lazy CGI.A fast pace, good cast including Pamela Franklin and Ida Lupino in herlast role, and great rat costumes make this a fine weekend movie."
1,a rat snuff film,"This is a terrible movie with one questionable virtue: the spectacle of dozens of real rats really shotgunned. It looks like they used a 20 gauge. It could be some kind of stunt, but nobody told the rats. Certainly these rats react violently to the projectiles that hit them, and they don't seem to like it. They are knocked end over end by bloody impact. Meat flies off the wounds, even. They seem hurt, and they squirm pretty convincingly. Perhaps they are good rat actors.There is lots of bad process photography, and the puppet rat heads are unimpressive. But the real rats are filmed against miniature sets in medium and long shots. Such wholesale slaughter seems unlikely as late as '76, but I doubt the FOTG set even saw a caterer, much less OSHA and the Humane Society. I don't know anything about this production, but I've shot a few rats, and this is what it looks like."
2,Mr.Big does it again,"Bert I Gordon, was known as Mr. Big for his large out of the ordinary creatures such as Giant Rats, Chickens,Wasps and Maggots. This film features these mutants.I worked on this film in 1975, in British Columbia, Canada. It was mostly filmed on Bowen Island, not far from Vancouver. As hokey as the film seemed, it was fun to work on.However it was a shame to see a star the likes of Ida Lupino with all her talents working on this film. The film did not do good at the box office, but I would bet it made money for Mr. Big. It is predectable, but somewhat entertaining, if not hilarious."
4,IT IS TIME FOR GIANT RATS (TO BE ON DVD),It goes without saying that this classic needs to be released on dvd. Whoever owns the rights must get on it and put it out. Millions of children are missing out on seeing HUGE rats attack. FOOD OF THE GODS. ON DVD. NOW!
1,Even Giant Rats Get Tedious After a While,"Bert Gordon must have get the ""wiggins"" from rats because he takes them and uses them to far too much of a degree in this sadly bad film.Even as a kid when I paid my hard-earned allowance to see this in the cinema, I knew I'd been ripped off.Why aren't the other animals scuttling about the island used? You know a giant snake would have given me the creeps, but the rats just look bored - even giant rats.This is pure drive-in cinema that should have been on a double bill with a Herschal Gordon gorefest flick (but I'd never have been able to get into it then).Poor Ida Lupino - what in the world was she thinking?! Surely her bank account wasn't so empty she was forced to perform in this travesty?!"
1,H.G. Wells would cry bitter tears,"In H.G. Wells classic novel of the same title, the gigantism of the human beings who were given the ""food of the gods"" caused them to look at their world in new and intriguing ways. The book was largely a philosophical tome in which the size of living creatures was really just a metaphor for people who would maintain the staus quo of the ""old world"" and the giants who would fight for more a more rational world. It had elements of a traditional sci fi story but it was much more than that.But the movie sucked. Big time! And Mary Joseph Gortner should have stayed in the Bible Belt revival biz."
4,Understanding,The man is probably the father of understanding disease as dis easewith many relevations of spirit and character acting in unisob with the human condition
4,Exciting and unusual!,I have read most of the Draycott Abby series and this was the first time that I have read Christina Skye's later books. I have to say that I loved the book and right now that is unusual for me.
3,"Nice, Inexpensive Headphones",These headphones are okay. If you don't want to spend a ton of money for headphones that have average sound quality these are a pretty good buy.
2,Cheap!,"You get what you pay for. I bought this for my daughter to use in Media at school and she hated it. It didn't cost much, and because of this, it's not even worth the expense to return. Next..."
2,Not so good,I bought these for my small kids to listen to movies on the plane. They don't care much for earbuds. The sound on these old things are horrible. Keeping in mind that the plane can be hard on the ears for sound qulaity. You get what you pay for. :)
1,Easily Broken,"Bought for a classroom. I bought 6 for the listening center, all lasted about one week. The cord that goes to the ear piece easily can be pulled out. I have first graders. Not worth the price if you have more than one child going to use them."
1,Save your money.,"The lowest quality headset I've ever owned, but what can you say for $2.00. Just save that $2.00 and put more $$$ with it for something better."
1,cheap price but you get what you pay for!,Saved money but the headphones are worthless to me. Lousy sound and nothing can be done about it as the price was as cheap as you can get..better luck next time.
3,What.,How long is the cord how long is the cord how long is the cord how long is the cord why isn't the cord length listed how long is the cord what the heck how long is the cord why why why aren't complete specs given how long is the cord how long is the cord.
1,"""Diamond"" point set","This is a cheap product, not worth the cost of shipping. the ""Diamond"""" particles are gone after one use."
3,like a visit with grand-dad,"This series of stories promises to be fun - short stories with a twist - but it reads more like Paul Harvey's ""the rest of the story."" The twists, while not always predictable, are often just a little curve, and rarely surprising.It reads more like Archer just wanted to reminisce, and found a publisher to let him do so."
5,A Fascinating and a damn hilarious book,"So beautifully are these short stories written, you will not believe me unless you read them. Yes, every story has a ""Twist"" and you could never have guessed how it would be. I liked the story ""We are just good friends"" one of the best among them. And then there is the jury in one of the stories....Ok ,Ok I will not tell you more, so get your hands on the book."
1,disappointed,two stories at best were worth reading in this book of short stories.i guess i expected far too much as kane and abel is so very awesome[same author].
2,A big disappointment i,The first in this series was much better than twist in the tale. Ill read the last one but the sins was the best
3,Telegraphed Outcome,"All of the ""shorts"" except one are forseeable. I am an Archer fan but these shorts seem to be his earliest work exercises while still in school."
1,Avid reader,I agree with those who felt these short stories were of low quality and not up to Archer's standards.Most had no point and were a waste of time.
3,What can I say?,"As many story tellers the book has good ones -a few. And bad ones. Some stories will make you think at the end of them and many will let you down. Take this book while on vacation, read it when you have some time and maybe you'll like it just for the pastime of reading."
4,Good and nice merchandize,"It is a good and nicely made. My son and I are enjoying every night playing this game. One thing though, when latches open, board will not open flat. Because of the same reason, our wooden table top is getting dings. Minor problem."
3,"Average quality, decent price","This backgammon game is not the best quality attache I've seen, but it's of fairly decent quality for the price. Good for teaching a child how to play."
4,Just wish I had more opponents,"This is an excellent game. I really enjoy playing it and the game case and pieces are of very good quality. I bought it, primarily, to use with a grandchild who loves games and especially any activity involving numbers. We have played when she is visiting and I've been reminded how much I really like backgammon."
2,It literally fell apart,"I bought this backgammon attache less than five months ago and I have used it 5-10 times. Already, the screws that connect the two halves of the board came out and won't go back in. The holes that the screws screw into no longer secure them."
5,Beautiful,"This is a very nice backgammon set. It is a bit large for travel, but still manageable. We had a great time playing on vacation."
4,Great game,"Great game, the materials and dice are not of the best quality, but for the price it is an excellent choice."
4,Murray - avant,"This recording is one of Murray's more adventuresome recordings, full of drive and intensity. Not for the casual listener, or someone starting their Murray collection, but any Murray completist will want to pick this one up."
5,The Dr. Spock of Puppy rearing,"I thought this book was very readable, and full of good, practical information. Yes, there is some repetition of key points, but I even liked that. After reading, I felt I retained 99% of the info, and that even family members with less interest in having the puppy turn out super would both read and retain the key points. A great book for getting the whole family on-board with proven puppy-rearing methods."
4,New puppy help.,"This book was very helpful with my new German Shepherd puppy, evn though I already have 3 other dogs, it's nice to read new/different styles and ideas for giving your BIG dog the right start."
2,Much better puppy training books are available,"I was really disappointed with this puppy training guide. Not only did the training information sometimes conflict with virtually every other reputable puppy training guide (I have read about 10 of them) in key aspects, but the author's ego permeates the pages. It's not a pleasant reading experience for a secure mature adult woman. This guy's unprocessed masculinity and control issues don't belong in a puppy training guide! Add to these problems poor editing and barely adequate writing ability and this book is harder to like than an aggressive floor-soiling nippy chihuahua pup. Yuk! A poor investment indeed."
1,UNREALISTIC ADVICE ON PUPPY REARING,"I've read several different puppy parenting books, and I have to say that this ideology was so idealistic and ridiculous I couldn't finish the book. I was appalled at the suggested traing methods in this book, and at the author's expectations for ""appropriate"" puppy behavior. It is great advice if you want to end up with a furry robot for a dog!"
5,6 star rating.,"I have seen The Gregorio Cortez Movie probably about 20 times. I was good friends with Dr. Americo Paredes, the writer of the book and live very close to the area that Senor Cortez lived and worked. This movie should be made a standard in every school in America. It was very dramatic, sensitive, and a eye opener."
5,This book is worth more than your money.,"I strongly recommend this book. The translations are beautiful (and are direct translations, not renderings). The notes on each poem are extensive, and I find them alone interesting to read. My only qualm is that I think the cover's a little ugly, but I suppose you can always tape a nice picture over it.(And of course, I would be remiss not to warn anyone interested in Hafiz away from a certain Daniel Ladinsky. Ladinsky invents his own original poetry and markets it as the work of Hafiz. It seems almost impossible to look up Hafiz without coming across this man's words falsely attributed to Hafiz.)"
2,Academic But Not Uplifting,"Yet another stiff, unimaginative version of the great poet Hafiz. This is a poet of the heart and spirit, not someone who can be pinned down in word-for-word translation. Still, this is an honest academic effort; just not rewarding or uplifting for the spirit."
5,Want to know what the real south is like?,This book of quotes gives the most toal picture of the true South that I have seen. Southerners will appreciate it. Others will just enjoy it.
1,I feel duped,"I bought this book thinking it would be a collection of colorful southern language quotes like its title. It's not. While the quotes are interesting and sometimes maddening (if you're from the South), rarely do they approach the colorful style of the book's title. The authors would have added to my enjoyment if they had told me something of the less well known people they quoted (such as a simple ""editor of the Podunk Times""). With another title -- and thus with different expectations -- not a bad book, but I feel duped!"
5,"Beautiful, haunting music","Love listening to this on a rainy day, or as background while working on writing. Gorgeous and deep. Love it."
5,"""And the Oscar goes to....""","The measure of great film music is how it melds with the on-screen activity, complementing AND complimenting. Bernard Herrmann and Miklos Rozsa knew it. John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith know it. And to this fraternity, one must add Thomas Newman. With ""Road to Perdition"", Newman has crafted one of the most strikingly original scores to grace a film in over a decade.The music is a glowing accompaniment to an already great film. I don't know if I were more captivated by the visuals than I was the instrumental ""treats"" for my ears.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will truly be in error should it not bestow the coveted prize to the composer."
1,Drivel,"The movie was only okay, but I was hooked on the music, so I bought the soundtrack. Yikes! What an mistake! This is HORRIBLE stuff - sentimental, cloying, devoid of substance, repetitive with no payoff. This is the kind of ""music"" that gives movie soundtracks a bad name. This is the kind of music that is only ""atmospheric"" for the film to which it was attached, and which has NOTHING to say apart from it. Avoid this disc at all costs."
5,The best ever,"Wow. This score is incredible. I could listen to it endlessly. Especially track 7 ""The Road to Chicago"". For such a violent movie, the music is haunting and beautiful. Close your eyes and imagine. Where it will take you is a personal journey.Because of the incredible beauty of this music, I have ordered other CD's from Thomas Newman (without so much as a listen in advance) and have not been disappointed. The Horse Whisperer has a similar quality. Amazing and beautiful - you won't tire of listening again and again.Peggy"
4,Very touching,"I've probably seen this movie 6 times, not only because of the movie it self, but for the sound track, every scene in this movie has it's own interpretation of the sound track, both the sound track and the scene make you cry, i got to the point that when i listen to the Audio CD, i visualize the movie for that specific movie scene."
2,Disappointing--and not well edited,"Though I love her work, I am disappointed in Porcella's new book. Not only do the projects lack her work's usual vibrancy, but the diagrams and directions contain inaccuracies--for example, a drawing shows a strip of seven 2-inch squares as being the same length as a 20-inch strip.It's too bad--I really looked forward to receiving the book. Oh well, maybe taht will teach me not to buy pre-pub."
2,Very disappointing,"I love Yvonne Porcella's work. It has a distinctive look, filled with simple shapes and bright primary colors. Sadly, most of that is missing in this book. I can just hear the publisher telling her to use varied palettes to appeal to more people. Who knows? Maybe she will. But somehow I can't see the repro and plaid crowd wanting to make her freeform quilts. If they want to, there are instructions for how to assemble a conglomeration of 4-patch and 9-patch units with spacer strips. In trying to please everyone, the book ended up being neither traditional nor contemporary and all the magic is missing."
4,Give a girl a break,"Great creativity is sometimes born of impatience, and this seems to be the case with Yvonne Porcella, who says she never has made a large quilt using a repeated block because ""I do not like the precision required to measure and calculate fabrics to make a large quilt."" Instead, she thinks up magical numbering schemes, fiddles with brightly colored strips of fabric, and makes eye-popping quilts out of simple elements. In this book she shares her clever techniques in great detail and with lots of examples. Some reviewers have carped that Porcella departs from her usual bright primary palette in this volume, but it is nowhere written that an artist can't experiment with other styles and appeal from time to time to other color sensibilities. The primary purpose of the book is to teach a highly formalized technique, and the variety of color choices shows that it works as well for country plaids as for high contrast."
3,great ideas...terrible instructions,"I met the author and admired her quilts several years ago at a showing at a Gallery in Modesto. I am making a second quilt from the book and now I'm remembering why I never used the book after the first time. She has you cut way more fabric than you actually need, AND the instructions are often incomplete so pieces don't fit the way they are illustrated which is very frustrating even for a VERY experienced quilter which I am (which is also possibly why I do most of my own designes now....no worries about following instructions....). I am going to write a note to myself and put it into the book...cut as you go...and don't believe the instructions....."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"I am sorry I bought this book. Perhaps the author has an artistic vision which works for her, but these photos of her quilts look very amateurish. The directions are poor. She states she started this method because she had trouble getting her blocks/seams to match. Her solution is to take a row of blocks, add random strips of fabric, then square it up after it is finished. One does not need to spend money on a book to learn how to do this. Please find a book that has good patterns or can teach you something about quilting."
5,Panama Canal,We loved this DVD. We took a Panama Canal cruise after viewing. Recommend both the video and the cruise through the canal.
5,Very interesting,I ordered this as part of a presentation I gave. This is a very informative video about the Panama Canal and its history. I loved viewing the old black and white films. I have never been there and knew very little about it. Now I feel like an expert!
4,It only took a day to read this book.,"This book is not overly technical. The punchline is in the appendix where the yield of the device is stated. It is a good sized book and only took a day to read. The author does not overstate his case. (Back in the cold-war Soviet defectors wrote lousy books, this fellow from Iraq is OK). I first heard about this book on a Iraqi-exile bulletin board and there have not been any negative comments posted about it to that bulletin board. The book appears to be the genuine article. I did not notice any technical errors in the small percentage of text that is technical. This book appears to be the genuine article."
3,"Interesting, but not a thorough treatise","I was very happy to acquire this book for my library, and for the less-than-retail price, it was a good buy. However, I guess I was expecting more of a technically detailed history of Iraq's NWEPS program, than an autobiography.This book centers on the writer, who thinks of himself as the centerpiece of Iraq's nuclear bomb-building efforts. Just enough technical detail is included to whet the appetite of the reader. The characters, locations, and events are only fleshed out where they pertain to the author.If you are interested in Mr. Hamza, then this is a GREAT book. If you are interested in the Iraqi nuclear weapons program, you will walk away feeling unfufilled."
5,Should be required reading,"Before reading this book, I was strongly against President Bush and his stance on Iraq. Dr. Hamzah paints a crystal picture of Saddam and his regime. This was truly a frightening page turner. God bless us all."
5,Great Book Simply Put,"This book was amazingly good and not overly technical. It is an easy read and is also about what happens in Iraq, not just the making of the bomb. This is a great book and a definite read if you are interested in the subject. I want a sequel!"
4,"Awesome, YEARS of fun for a low price.","I had bought this wheel in late March of 2007 and have used it for at least 1000hrs over those years and to this day it still amazes me as it has held up to me drifting(throwing the from back to forth) with the feedback on. Which is by far the best force feedback function I've experienced in a wheel besides the real thing. My only real problem with this product is the rear shifters on the wheel, which unlike the real thing the buttons move with the wheel(which have a slight delay in one that started a while ago),but the front buttons still work fine. Pedals are good, but have very little natural resistence and for me slightly too close together. I have since rigged it to a homemade canopy for a precise height, but this thing is a resilient piece maufacturing. If you can find one of these anymore I would recommend it highly over the Microsoft versions 10 fold."
3,Not Bad,"its not a high performance vacuum, it will clean the dust. but wont pick up leaves or big paper pieces. considering the price of it, gives an average rating."
1,Don't buy it. Dangerous,I first read the warning coming with the box. It says that the product contains cancer causing material and you have to wash your hand every time you use it. I decide to return it immediately.
1,Bad buy,the product came with a broken cord. Sending it back would cost the price of shipping so I just took the fall. Do not buy
3,Dont expect more,This is a good one to have but not an efficient one as I thought it would be. I thought it would suck the dust and other small particles spread in the car very easily but its not.
2,Not enough suction,"I purchased this product as a present for my sister and tried it last week. I found that it did not have enough suction to remove the type of dirt or lint that accumulates on an automobile's carpet. After several minutes of vigorously sweeping the carpet with this vacuum, I just gave up. I also tried to remove pet hair from the cloth upholstery, but again, the effort was in vain. I was attracted to this product by the low price and the generally favorable reviews, but after using it once, I just put it back in the box, and buried it deep in my sister's car trunk. I doubt it will ever come out of that box again."
4,great for price,"This vaccuum works great-especially for the price. I haven't tried to use it on something wet but on dry carpet works pretty well. I like all the attachments it comes with, gets in the crevices."
3,Good for Car Use,"Many have complained that car vacs this size don't have much suction. I wonder if they think it is to be as powerful as the vacuums at the car wash. This vacuum won't ""clean"" the inside of the car like a heavy duty vacuum, but it gets the basic dirt up. It's small and convenient."
3,Not very strong,I used this to pick up the little bits of dirt in the car but i felt it really wasn't that strong when it came to picking up the dirt.It has little attachments to for the nooks and crannies but i find the regular gas station vacuums do the job a lot better.
5,12V Wet/Dry Vac,"Our son purchased a runabout this past summer and wanted a 12V Wet/Dry Vac for it. He was quite pleased on Christmas with this ReadiVac 12V Wet/Dry Vac. The price was excellent, and the product was shipped to us very quickly."
4,Nice little vacuum,"This is a nice little vacuum ideal for a car. I dont like dirt, leaves and dust which settles down by the driver side due to constant in and out. This thingy is perfect for spot cleaning. Its wet and dry vacuum giving it an edge. the suction is good at 12V. Not noisy and i dont care even if it was. My friend and me ordered these together. unfortunately his does not work. It doesnt start when plugged in the cigarette lighter socket. He is going to get a different product.Anyways, its a small tidy machine. i repeat its good for spot cleaning. it doesnt suck like the regular home vacuum guys."
1,effective for about 2 minutes,"I purchased one of these, wanting the convenience of plugging the unit into the car cigar lighter receptacle so that I could follow up after an exterior-only car wash. However, it worked for only 2 minutes. It continued to run but wouldn't pick up anything. I tried it and retried it, finding that although the motor continued to run, it did not create a vacuum. Didn't want to go to the trouble of sending it back for repairs or replacement so I just ordered an Oreck which, I hope, will be more reliable."
1,Never been more disappointed in my life,"I bought this item as a gift for my husband. After 2 1/2 months, we thought we finally had it figured out. But just this evening, it erased the latest disc when my husband plugged it in to try and finalize it. It just displayed ""Disc Access"" for several minutes before shutting itself off. When he was finally able to get it to come back up, everything on it (our sons' track finals and talent show) was gone. I definitely would not recommend this product as it is too tempermental and difficult to use, not to mention the heartache caused by losing precious moments such as the ones we lost today."
1,Hitachi Camcorder,"This is a terrible product. You can barely film indoors because the lens limits wide angle filming. If you can't get at least 15 feet from your intented subject, you will be limited to filming their head. ALERT*** You can only use Maxell discs!!! Other disc might intially work, but will fail when you try to format them. This is not mentioned anywhere in the manual. Strangely enough Hitachi owns Mawell. Hmmmmmm???"
2,DO NOT BUY HITACHI,"This camera has only 90 days of warranty,Yes brand new and only 90 days.After waiting months of browsing and research on what would be a good DVD Camcorder for our Family moments I have wrongly choose Hitachi because of the price and the nice feature of the 3.3 Mega Pixels...whatever.It was my daughter's recital and I tape all the event but when I tried to take a picture and returned to camcorder mode the Access light was flashing and then the disc became corrup the the camera ask if you want to repair but ohhh surprise the disc became with no data like blank.3 times happen and the I realize I need to call service and gues what it was only a day after the 90 days of warranty so If I want to get my camera inspected for any defect I'll need to pay 85 usd plus labor plus parts.Don't choose wrong think twice."
5,A whimsical tribute to love,"""Love, Love, Love,"" by Andy Warhol, reproduces several different works, done in various media, by graphic artist Andy Warhol. Some of the selections are black-and-white, and some are in full color. These drawings and paintings are complemented by many quotes from Andy Warhol on the title subject.This is a delightful book, full of witty and whimsical images. Hearts, flowers, angels, lips, and other motifs are frequently used. This is a great book both for both Warhol devotees and for general readers."
1,Atrocius Quality,"The movie Le Bambole is quite an interesting picture [which I can recommend], as it reflects of the 1960s Italian morals, but this DVD should be avoided at all costs. The quality of the print is simply abysmal. It looks as this had been sourced from a second generation video, if not worse."
1,Poor Customer Service,They do not service their own items and the companies that do are few and far between. The balance of quality and power are not equal. If you push this drill to operate as it is advertised you will ruin it. Mine sparks everytime I let go of the trigger. It has been used four times and all of the drilling was into soft woods. Buy a Dewalt if you want a quality cordless drill.
5,Strong Drill,Very Good Drill. It has much more torque than others I have had. I don't know how I got along without it!
2,Biggest Disappointment of Brian's Career,"Hoo, boy... We all waited for this one, and despite what the fanatics say, it's the most disappointing release of Brian's career with far too few moments of the ""genius"" we've come to expect. I mean, we, his fans, have always held Brian up as one of the great (albeit misunderstood and under-appreciated) pop artists of the century, which he certainly is... but you'll never prove it by this awful album. Contains exactly one worthy track, ""Lay Down Burden"", and the single most embarrassing cut he's ever done, ""South American"". Still, the worst of Brian is worth hearing once, and this album is a lot better than that Andy Paley horror that's making the bootleg rounds. But for REAL Brian, catch him on his concert tour... He's terrific!"
3,b- on report card,"sure there are a couple of duds alongside the gems on this album. the beach boy remakes, keep you eye on summer and let him run wild are nice updates of the classic original versions done by wilson in the 60s. cry is a great tune as is lay down burden. the production by one-time pro wrestler turned country music producer joe thomas is a bit stale and sterile. they should've let brian produce the album w. andy paley or the wondermints and it could have been a much stronger effort."
4,"""Sonny"" Wilson Vs. Buddy Love","Brian's gift for melody is very much intact, and his current material tends to reflect the quality (and taste) of his collaborators. This album attempts to present Brian to a contemporary adult audience beyond his fanatical fanbase (of which I'm a devout member), and the results are a bit mixed, but his gifts shine through. ""Your Imagination"" is a terrific song, and ""Lay Down, Burden"" is touchingly personal in the way that his best work has always been. The reworking of his lost song ""Sherry, She Needs Me"" doesn't quite work, but the revisits of Beach Boys classics ""Keep An Eye On Summer"" and ""Let Him Run Wild"" are of special interest to his fans, and the listening is smooth and his voice is in good form.Some time after this album Brian split with producer Joe Thomas, who reportedly once wrestled under the name ""Buddy Love"", and began his fabulous work with the Wondermints, Jeffrey Foskett, and company."
4,Sparkles,"Considering all he has been through in life, it's very good to hear Brian Wilson so healthy and focused - he can still write, sing great emotional harmonies, and produce very well. The first half of the album is quite as good as ever, and ""Lay Down Burden"" and a solo version of ""Let Him Run Wild"" are also quite moving, each in their own way. There are a few weaker spots of songwriting in the second half, as if Wilson couldn't quite sustain the original energy, but there is enough original energy in the album overall to make it a must have for Wilson fans."
4,Nice to have Brian Recording Again,This is nice pop music CD. After all that Brian has gone though it nice to still have him around making enjoyable music.
3,A fine album,"Although the sound hasn't worn too well with me, this is still an enjoyable album (except for a few musical clunkers like the pointless remakes). This isn't the masterpiece or the blockbuster so many hoped for, but it is a good listen. Thanks, Brian."
4,classic brian wilson doing what he does best,"I hope Brian never stops making music. It was always hard not to feel good when a Beach Boys song was playing, and the same is true for this latest solo effort of Brian's. Nobody puts harmonies together like Brian Wilson. It's good to know that whatever demons have plauged him throuout his life, his gift remains intact. I've noticed some people feel like the instruments behind the vocals are too thin. Who cares? You don't buy a Brian Wilson CD for the instrumentation. Just enjoy this for what it is-Brian Wilson doing what he does best."
5,Thelost city of Brian Wilson is found!,"Eleven more songs you can't wear out. Better get this one if you haven't already, then buy a spare for your heirs. Hope this is just a warm-up disc. Wait till Brian releases ""The Spirit of Rock and Roll."" Keep adding to the Wilson legacy."
4,BRINGS BACK THE 'GOOD OLD DAYS'!,"There is no doubt that Brian Wilson is a creative, musical genius. While I appreciate and admire his genius talent, I immensely prefer to kick back and listen to enjoy myself. I'm not one of those who dissects his melodies, lyrics, concepts, etc. I am just happy to be able to hear some of the greatest music of all time--that which comes from the soul and heart of Brian Wilson. ""Imagination"" reminds me of much of the original Beach Boys' music. Dennis and Carl are gone, yet I can hear their spirit in his songs. I've seen Brian solo this year and he sounds more like the whole group in the '60s than the band that is now touring as ""The Beach Boys"". I bought ""Imagination"" because I wanted to hear more music reminiscent of the group I so loved back then, and still do. This suited the purpose just fine!"
4,True Brian fans shouldn't be disappointed,"Any true fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys recognizes that the main reason Brian flipped out years ago is that he started to think people expected him to turn out a ""masterpiece"" every time he wrote a song. After reading some of these reviews of ""Imagination"", I can see why he might have seen it that way (Yes ""Fans"", Brian is a fallible human being like everybody else, who on occasion, will write a song that won't fill you with rapture!). Real fans of Brian recognize and love him for what he was and is: Quite simply, an extremely talented composer who has enabled people to dream beautiful dreams for over 30 years (people who simply enjoy his songs without worrying about whether or not they're works of art). My review? If you agree with every word I've written, then you should like ""Imagination"" a whole lot!"
4,Surprisingly Good,"Many reviewers compare this new album to Pet Sounds. It doesn't. Still, what is amazing is not that it IS NOT Pet Sounds, but that it is good at all. Which it is. Don't pay any attention to the hype. Just listen to the album. It stands tall on its own. I give Wilson a lot of credit for pulling this off. Great melodic hooks. Carefully crafted pop songs. His strengths shine through."
2,Half A Good Album Does Not Make A Great Album,"Yeah, well. Only fanboys bought this album. And mostly fanboys review it, in the unquestioningly adoring manner of the Brianista. but the Rest Of The World (and there are quite a few of us) greeted this release with a resounding two cheers. Lazy product; couple of so-what retreads that answer a musical question no-one was asking, and Brian's worst-ever song; the Care-Bears On Downers stumble through the non-ironically named ""Happy Days"".Yep, there's a few lovely songs here, all dressed up in a satin tour-jacket of a production, but hardly enough for the ten years it took to cobble the thing together.Stop cossetting him, guys. He can, and should, do better."
2,Doesn't Wear Well!,"I picked this CD up when it first came out and thought it was very good. I probably listened to it four or five times the first week. Then, the other day, I popped it in the car CD player and could barely make it through one song. In fact, I couldn't wait to trade it in. It is so incredibly sacharine and just plain dull. Brian Wilson hasn't made a decent CD since ""Pet Sounds"" (vastly overrated itself!) I've owned all his solo stuff and eventually traded them all in. They simply don't hold up."
3,Good enough!,"It's nice to hear Brian Wilson, it really is. ""Your Imagination"" is a great song, and some of the rest of them are nice. He also does a good version of ""Let Him Run Wild"" all by himself. The production on this album unfortunately sounds a little thin to me, too digital wtih no mid-range sounds bursting through. Those interested in a ""rebirth"" of Brian should also check out the finely produced album ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times,"" a collection of him performing old songs for producer Don Was."
4,Brian Wilson has a definite winner!!,"It has been a long time since I have heard Brian's voice sounding this good, and the melodies are just fantastic. The harmony is there, just like always, and the songs just take you away. I've been a fan of the Beach Boys since 1963, when I was kid in Canada, and hearing some of these songs like ""Your Imagination"" and ""Dream Angel"" and the new version of ""Keep an Eye On Summer"" just took me right back again to when I was younger. I hope Brian keeps on writing and creating these great tunes for a long time to come."
5,"Superb, a real gem!",I've enjoyed listening to this album more than any album I've bought in years. This is Brian Wilson at his best. After all of these years he's still got it (maybe even better). The music on this album just makes you feel good. This is a must if you like Brian and the Beach Boys.
5,Not The Album Reviewed Above!,"The set reviewed in the editorial section is the FMP release 'Posium Pendasem' which is unfortunately not carried by Amazon - I highly recommend that you seek it out.AS for ""In Order to Survive"" PArker utilizes a sextet that would become the In Order To Survive quartet. This set is on par with the quartet's great cds - The Peach Orchard or Posium Pendasem, the rich sound of the three horns and excellent playing of the rhythm section make this essential."
1,They Broke After Two Weeks,That pretty much says it all:One of the ear cables just straight up broke off the main cable after two weeks. Nuff said. Do not buy.
1,LEAD!,There is a Warning Label on the product stating that this product has LEAD on it & that you must WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER EVERY USE! Complete waste of money. LEAD is dangerous can cause medical issues. Avoid this product.
3,Well made and acted but too slow,"I saw a clear version of this movie under its French title Le Repos Du Guerrier. The movie had English subtitles.Bardot looks absolutely beautiful throughout this entire movie. Her acting is also incredibly good. She expresses a wide range of emotions (love, dispair, heartbreak, frustration, anger) very convincingly.By accident Bardot saves the life of a man (Robert Hossein) who tries to commit suicide. She befriends this pathetic creature and soon falls in love with him. They become lovers as Bardot breaks off her engagement to another man. Her new lover is both odd and mysterious. He loves Bardot but doesn't want to give himself to her completely.When Bardot finally leaves him, he becomes a lost soul. He can't live without her. He finds Bardot and asks her to marry him. She embraces him warmly.I believe this movie was well made and appeals to a certain audience but it was simply too slow and soap-opera like for my taste."
3,Don't get the DVD advertised,"I noted several reviews about dubbing and how the colors were ""yellow and washed out"". The film was shown in French with English subtitles on TV5, the international French station, with fairly good color. Look for another edition.(I haven't completed the movie as I write, my rating of 3 is simply because it is impossible to post this comment with out some rating)"
5,Great show but beware,This show is great but beware. I have recived three copies of it and all three had scratched DVDs. The only way I was able to get a full working set was to swap discs from two of the sets.
5,Love It,Gundam Seed Destiny Collection 1 Contains 6 Discs (Episode 1 - Angry eyes) To (Epiosde 26 - The Promise)English And Japanese Audio And The Japanese Subtiles and The Second Set Of Subtiles is To Translate The Title Of each Epiosde And The Intro and Outro songs
4,Loved This Story,"I loved this story when I was in my early teens: I must have read the book four or five times. This is the story of a greenhorn from the East who, against all odds, becomes a working cowboy. Not only that, he decides that he, and he alone, will capture the wild black stallion that others have failed to make their own. James depicts the Western setting with details that bring the world to life. He knows cowboys and he knows horses, and that shows. This is a great book to read if you want to experience that world."
2,Disappointing,"Nice variety of accessories, but cheap metal, poor China construction. One of the connection pieces had a beyond obvious flaw from the factory. The first 3 threads were not alligned and a large notch went through them, making it basically unusable. The blow gun is too small, designed for a child maybe. The valves do not thread snug with the air hose, heavy tape needed to stop severe air leakage. Not what I would expect from Porter Cable."
2,Not Typical Porter-Cable Quality,"This kit gave me the parts I needed when I first bought an air compressor. However, the fittings are cheap and I ruined my good hose trying to tighten the kit's male plug enough to stop it from leaking. I have since purchased new plugs to use with my tools. Also, the tire chuck is good for the money but I'd spend more for a good system if I could do it again. One more problem: I now have a space in my garage occupied by attachments I may never use. Conclusion: buy what you need when you need it. You'll get better quality for about the same price."
4,Great Assortment / No Instructions,A nice package of accessories for many requirements reasonably priced. They just need to include some illustrations and instructions. I was not sure what several items were for and how they would be used.
1,"Cheep stuff, expensive price!",You can get the same kit at Harbor Freight for under $7. Cheep stuff for a big price.
3,This item is exactly as described by earlier reviewers,"This set has a great selection of adapters and compressor accessories. However, few of them are of reasonable quality.For the price, I'm glad I purchased the kit. I've used a number of accessories around the house, and couldn't have completed some of my jobs without them.Maybe down the road I'll buy some better quality pieces, but for a novice with his 1st compressor, this kit worked just fine. Just don't buy it hoping that you'll be impressed..."
4,"Nice to Have, but not NEED to haves.","The quality of the materials warrrants a three star rating. The usefulness of these things would have made this a five star. The air nozzle needed a little touch of tape to stop it from leaking air, but once that was solved, it's very useful. The other items come in handy for non-nailer tasks such as filling tires on cars, bikes, and wheelbarrows. The needle valves work on footballs, basketballs, etc. I haven't used the brush yet. The larger sized connectors might come in handy if I purchase a framing nail gun and need the higher capacity air flow."
3,There ok but....,"You can get more for a little more price:S---s item #00916191000 Mfr. model #16191I have the same thing and they do work fine.These aren't mechanic grade by any means, but work very well for the hobby shop."
5,The pieces that you need for your machine,You have to consider that these pieces are useful when you need to fix your machine on time
5,"This book + the internet & you've got a ticket to Italy, France, and Beyond","This book is in a class of its own. Full of fun, fascinating stories and insight, you'll find yourself doing searches on the wines that capture your imagination ~ in this vivid and memorable wine book. I'm having such fun with this book and suddenly my friends think that I am the new source for wine tips, along with the website addresses where the prices are right. I can't think of a better gift than this book plus any bottle mentioned inside, because you will kickstart someone's own adventure. But first, get a copy for you and let the magic carpet take off to Italy, France, and beyond. It is all about learning to appreciate God's world. The finer things are gifts we should all taste, God's creation in a bottle shared with friends. Can it get any better than that?Ian Fitzgerald"
4,Lightweight Coby Headphones,I am happy with the headphones. They serve my purpose. They truly are lightweight. I would recommend them to a friend.
3,You definitely get what you pay for...,"The sound quality on these headphones is pretty mediocre. Even with the volume turned all the way up on my computer and iPod, I have difficulty hearing with them. The quality is no surprise since they are relatively cheap - they are good enough to listen to music while working."
3,Good quality,I purchased these for my classroom. I knew that they would be taking a beating but for the price and my budget they worked well. I do have three that are not working well because my students use them constantly everyday. They lasted longer than I thought they would.
2,Broke already...,"I bought 3 of them and they all broke already. Just cheap headphones, that is what I wanted. Well, I got that. Why am I complaining?"
4,Good Price Good Quality,"When you compare Quality and Price this head phone is really a good choice for daily usage. very low weight, good quality and very good price"
4,Pretty Good,"The headphones got here way before I thought it would. It was packaged very nicely, and the sound is fantastic! It was definitely worth the money."
2,You get what you pay for,"Worked and sounded fine, but only lasted a week before they broke. Really didn't expect too much at this price, but should have put the money toward a better headphone....a week is worthless."
1,Not a Fan of These,"I bought a few sets of these headphones to use in my classroom with mp3 players at a listening center. They do not work. Students are constantly frustrated that the sound cuts in and out. The headphones work occasionally, but you have to twist the jack around slowly, and my students are not all able to remember or do that. Other pairs of headphones work fine in the mp3 players, so I know it's the headphones that are the issue. I will not buy these again for work or home use. Next time I'll spend a little more money for quality."
3,"Functional, but fragile and no frills","I bought the headphones based on price alone, and got what I paid for: reasonable quality sound, but cheap parts. The adjustable parts of the headphone no longer stay in place because the little pieces of plastic that keep it in place have broken after 3 weeks of use. That said, the speakers themselves still work, and they don't fall off my head while I'm sitting at my desk so I can't complain. If you want quality, spend more money :)"
3,"nice older style, lightweight, fairly good sound","So, I just bought these b/c my ear canal is too small for earbud-type ear phones. They are cheap and do the job. I've had them for about a month. I listen to books on tape for about 2 hours a day. I hope they last. The sound seems a little like it is coming from far away, but I have also used very fancy seinheiser headphones comparitively. So for $2.74, I guess it was worth the price :)"
2,A step above the other headphones,"Like my other review that should have been 1 star, these headphones are 1 tiny step above the others in terms of their abibility to last a long time, they only work out of one ear and are not long hair friendly, only buy these if they are less than a dollar."
2,"Great sound quality for a small price, but has stopped working","I was plesantly surprised at the sound quality of these headphones. It is rich and full and you can pick out a lot of different insturments across the tonal spectrum. They perhaps do not look the best and do not have the best comfort. But well worth 5 stars for the price. I am going to be using them at work, and they were an excellent choice.Update 11/17. My original review I have left intact above. A couple of weeks ago these developed crackling, then one side went out entirely. In spite of multiple efforts, that side has remained in-operable, hence the new 2 star rating. I wanted to leave the above review here, because, any product is capable of having some that end up not working for long. But for most of the products I buy that is not my experience. So I wanted to update what happened with mine and for whatever it is worth that was my exprience with the smallest possible sample size of 1."
4,Good,Good for the money. I would buy them again. Accomplish what they were made for. I wouldn't waste money on more expensive ones these do the job fine.
4,excellent,"nice product. fast shipping. recommended seller to buyers out there. only thing is, when you wear this product, u don't get the real maximum sound. but still good if you are going price-based"
2,Coby is useless,"I keep buying this brand and they keep stop working on me. After two months of very gentle and careful use, the sound on one side disappeared. Very frustrating....I am planning not to buy this brand again and would not recommend this product. You basically get what you pay for."
1,No information on Chilean wines,"This book is a thorough disappointment. The author visited one winery in Chile. He has no background in evaluating wine, he gives no description of the overall industry or wine regions of Chile, and no real discussion of Chilean wines. Given this lack of substance you might expect at least a charming travelogue. But alas, to add insult to injury, this journal reads like a high schooler's first trip, complete with descriptions of parking at O'Hare, hotel gym facilities, etc. It is hard to understand how this book got published."
1,Sauvignon Boring,"This book contains very little information on Chilean wines and not enough insight into Chilean culture. I don't want to call the author racist but I got the impression that he views Chileans as second class people. Like it was so much for him to ACTUALLY consider THESE people his friends.I was also shocked when I opened the book and found it to be published in double space format, not very professional at all."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","This was the worst travel book I've read in a long time. Its basically a simple diary of a travel junket sponsored by one of the 2nd tier wineries in Chile. The biggest insight was what the daily meal was.I've been to Morande myself. I didn't feel the need to write a book about it.The publisher has my money, so I guess I'm the bigger idiot."
4,It's Time to Stop and Smell the Sunflowers!,"I got a mini of this for my mom a couple of years ago for her birthday and she thought it was so-so. However I, on the other hand, loved it! To make a long story short, the perfume became mine (my mom is more of a Red Door person I guess). This flowery, powerful perfume is sure to seduce and allure!*This fragrance has notes of rose, cedar, lemon, musk, moss, amber, manderin, and jasmineTips/Suggestions/Comments involving Sunflowers:1) This is a rather moderate scent. I would'nt call it subtle nor would I call it intense. It's juusst right~2) This perfume lasts about as long as most perfumes (8 or so hours).3) This perfume is great for a day at work OR a night out in town.4) This perfume, at least in my opinion is great for both adults and teens so Moms, feel free to share this scent with your daughters! (or vice versa)"
3,Light smell,I have always loved this sent. It's VERY light. I spray it on in the morning and two hours later I can't smell it. I just wish it would last longer.
4,Bee Game,A very good game for children my granddaughter just loved this game I would buy from this person or company again
2,No Buzz Here,"While I thought this game was going to be fun for the kids, since the movie was pretty good, it is not. They played with it for about two days and then lost interest. There wasn't a sence of direction on how to accomplish what the game wanted you too."
2,Gah!,"Hi! This novel is riddled with typos. It's clunky and awkward. There are some tremendously good moments, though they're ride scattershot through bad terrain. I have no idea what the author was thinking when he wrote half of what's in there, and he should have revised it some more, and he should have taken some more stuff out. That said, the author meant well. Had he been less impatient he could have salvaged a novella-length gem out of this promising but unwieldy rock.If you're willing to look for the good bits there are good bits to be found. I'm glad I wrote it. I'd be happy to hear you read it."
4,Pretty good saw,"Good saw. It does bog down every once in a while but I think its due to bad blades. Its affordable and it works, get it.JP"
3,Buy at Fleet Farm,"Just a heads up..if you have a fleet farm in your area..here in Green Bay anyway, they have the iron pieces in all styles,looks just like these, and they're on clearence for $3!"
3,You get what you pay for,"The plastic fencing is pretty flimsy. I would only recommend it for a temporary cheap edging. It is exactly what I expected for the price, no surprises."
1,Wow...just wow!!!,"This guy is the worst rapper I've ever heard; he's not just bad. He's pathetic; I couldn't even listen to this whole song and had the misfortune of listening to ""Why Must I Cry"" which is even worse than Blacken Chinese Man. I would've given this review a ""0"" but I could rate it this low. If you need a good laugh and have money to waste, by all means by this crap. But if you're looking for something good then stay away."
5,Chautauqua: A Forgotten Institution,"This is a wonderful accounting of how the late 19th century early 20th century cultural institution of the Chautauqua has survived and thrived in upstate New York on the shores of Lake Erie.President Theodore Roosevelt was quoted as saying that Chautauqua is ""the most American thing in America."" The Chautauqua brought entertainment and culture for the whole community, with speakers, teachers, musicians, entertainers, preachers and specialists of the day.
